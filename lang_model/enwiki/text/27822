'''The Decemberists''' are an [[indie rock]] band from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], United States, fronted by singer/songwriter [[Colin Meloy]]. The other members of the band are [[Chris Funk]] ([[guitar]], [[multi-instrumentalist]]), [[Jenny Conlee]] ([[hammond organ]], [[accordion]], [[melodica]], [[piano]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), [[Nate Query]] ([[bass guitar]], [[string bass]]), and [[John Moen]] ([[Drum kit|drums]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]], [[melodica]]).
The band's debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[5 Songs (The Decemberists EP)|5 Songs]]'', was self-released in 2001. Its fourth full-length album, ''[[The Crane Wife]]'', was released on October 3, 2006 by [[Capitol Records]], and is the band's first appearance on a major label.

==Musical style==

The band's songs range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads, and often employ instruments like the [[accordion]], [[Hammond organ]], [[Wurlitzer organ]], and [[Double bass|upright bass]]. In its lyrics, the band eschews the angst and introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a [[storytelling]] approach, as evidenced in songs such as "My Mother Was A Chinese Trapeze Artist" from the ''[[5 Songs]]'' EP and "The Mariner's Revenge Song" on ''[[Picaresque (album)|Picaresque]]''. The band's songs convey tales ranging from whimsical ("[[The Sporting Life]]") to epic ("[[The Tain]]") to a little dark ("[[Odalisque]]"), and often invoke historical events and themes from around the world. Early in their career, The Decemberists' musical and lyrical aesthetics 
frequently prompted critics to compare them to [[Neutral Milk Hotel]].<ref>{{cite news

==History==
===2000: Formation===
The Decemberists formed in 2000 when Colin Meloy left his band [[Tarkio (band)|Tarkio]] in Montana and moved to Portland, Oregon. There, he met Nate Query through friends. Query introduced Meloy to Jenny Conlee (they had played together in a band previously) and the three scored a silent film together. Upon playing a solo show previous to meeting Query, Meloy met Chris Funk. Funk was a fan of Tarkio and played pedal steel on the first two Decemberists releases, not "officially" becoming a member until the third effort. The band's first drummer, Ezra Holbrook, was replaced by Rachel Blumberg sometime after ''Castaways and Cutouts''. The band's name refers to the [[Decembrist revolt]], an 1825 revolt over the Imperial Russian succession that Meloy views as an attempted communist revolution,<ref>{{cite news

|accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> with another ''e'' added for clarity. ''5 Songs'', the band's first album, was self-released by The Decemberists in 2001. The members of the band at that time played for several hours in a McMenamins Hotel the night before to raise the money needed to record in the studio the next day. This originally served as a demo tape and the five songs on it (minus "The Apology Song") were recorded in under two hours.

===2003-2005: Kill Rock Stars===
After releasing its first full record ''[[Castaways and Cutouts]]'' on [[Hush Records]], the band moved onto the [[Kill Rock Stars]] recording label. After the re-release of ''Castaways'', ''[[Her Majesty The Decemberists]]'' was released in 2003. In 2004, the band released "[[The Tain]]", an eighteen-and-a-half minute single track based on the [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] epic ''[[T<U+00E1>in B<U+00F3> C<U+00FA>ailnge]]''. The band's final album with Kill Rock Stars was ''[[Picaresque (album)|Picaresque]]'', which was recorded in an old church. 

In March 2005, the band was the first to distribute a music video via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], the self-produced "[[16 Military Wives]]" (from ''[[Picaresque (album)|Picaresque]]'').<ref>{{cite news | title=Rockers Flex BitTorrent's Muscle | date=March 23, 2005 | publisher=Wired News | url=http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66969,00.html}}</ref> In the same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen;<ref>{{cite news | title=Decemberists Shipwrecked By Pirates | date=22 March 22, 2005 | publisher=CMJ | url=http://www.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=3547565}}</ref> fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fundraiser was organized via an [[eBay]] auction, with buyers bidding for copies of ''[[Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey]]'' and original artwork by [[Carson Ellis]]. The band also received help from [[Lee Kruger]], [[the Shins]], the [[Dandy Warhols]], and other musicians. The Martin Guitar Company offered 6- and 12-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer (and a fair amount of the band's merchandise) in [[Clackamas, Oregon]], but the instruments and equipment were not recovered.<ref>Hunt, Pete.

===2005: Capitol Records debut===
On December 12, 2005, Meloy revealed to [[Pitchfork Media]] that the band had signed to [[Capitol Records]], and planned to begin recording their major label debut with producers [[Tucker Martine]] and [[Chris Walla]] (of [[Death Cab for Cutie]]) in April 2006.<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/35595-exclusive-the-decemberists-sign-to-capitol-records Exclusive: The Decemberists Sign to Capitol Records.] Pitchfork. Retrieved on November 6, 2007.</ref> The band's first album on Capitol, ''[[The Crane Wife]]'', was released on October 3, 2006. The release was accompanied by an appearance the same day on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', during which the band performed "O Valencia!".  The supporting tour (called "The Rout of the Patagons Tour") began on October 17, 2006, at Portland, Oregon's [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]]. The opening act was [[Lavender Diamond]]. Later in the tour, [[Alasdair Roberts]] opened for the band. [[NPR]] listeners voted ''The Crane Wife'' their favorite album of 2006, as announced on the December 5 episode of ''[[All Songs Considered]]''.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/archives/bestof06/] NPR.</ref> 

===2006: Green screen music video===
In November 2006, the band encouraged fans to create a music video for the single "[[O Valencia!]]" using footage of the band in front of a green screen. On his [[Comedy Central]] [[The Colbert Report|program]], [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] started a mock feud with the band, claiming his "green screen challenge" came first;<ref>{{cite news |last=Maher |first=Dave |title= Video: Stephen Colbert Vs.

The feud culminated in a December 20 guitar solo competition<ref name="colbert" /> on Colbert's show, with lead guitarist Funk representing the band. After Colbert feigned a hand injury, [[Peter Frampton]] took over for Colbert and won an audience vote. Show guests got involved, with New York [[Governor of New York|Governor-elect]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] and Dr. [[Henry Kissinger]] declaring, "Tonight, I think the American people won." The prize for winning the challenge was revealed to be a copy of ''The Crane Wife''. According to Meloy, the Colbert challenge was not prearranged, and before Funk's appearance, they were only told that Frampton would step in for Colbert.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Colin Meloy of The Decemberists |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7061028 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>

===2007: "Long and Short of It" tour===
In July 2007, the band embarked on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment. On July 7, the tour put the band on the stage of the historic [[Hollywood Bowl]] for the first time, pairing them with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Mitchell |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003574344 |title=Decemberists Get Orchestra Treatment On Tour |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> On July 15, the band performed with The Mann Festival Orchestra at The Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they debuted a new song.<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=gE6omLCtnWI Decemberists at the Mann Center in Philadelphia- New Song.] YouTube. Retrieved November 6, 2007.</ref> The band then played a free concert in Chicago at the [[Millennium Park]] with the [[Grant Park]] Symphony Orchestra.  
On October 6, 2007, the band announced the cancellation of the remainder of their European tour, citing the ill health of a band member. On November 1, 2007, the band further canceled the remaining 28 shows of their "Long and Short of It" tour.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/05/people.decemberists.ap/index.html Decemberists cancel 28 shows due to illness.] CNN.com. Retrieved on November 6, 2007.</ref>

===2008: Always the Bridesmaid===
The members of The Decemberists appeared, individually billed (as "[[Colin Meloy]], [[Chris Funk]], [[Jenny Conlee]], [[Nate Query]], and [[John Moen]]"), to perform in support of [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] at a rally at the [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], on May 18, 2008. Starting on October 14th of 2008 the band started releasing a series of singles called ''[[Always the Bridesmaid]]''. A volume was released every month until the end of the year. The band also took up a limited tour in support of the singles, including an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' the day before the [[2008 Election]].

===2009: Hazards of Love===
In a 2007 interview, Colin Meloy described ''The Crane Wife'' as a "massive record... [with] crazy arrangements", and stated that the band is thinking about recording an album with more relaxed [[folk rock]] themes.<ref>{{cite news |last=Greenwald |first=David|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038840_20038841_20046328,00.html |title=Portland Trailblazer|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly (Magazine)|ew.com]] |date=2007-07-18 |accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> During an interview backstage at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in 2007, band members John Moen and Chris Funk stated that the band's next album would probably be released in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first=Joe|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BEsscobvk| title=The Decemberists Backstage at Bonnaroo 07|publisher=[[woxy.com]] |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>  The band's next album is being produced by Tucker Martine and will be released in April 2009 on Capitol Records<ref>http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/10/colin-meloy-talks-new-decemberists-album-with-past.html</ref>. In an October 7, 2008 newsletter to fans, the band revealed that the name of the new album will be "Hazards of Love". During the band's November 8, 2008 show in Baltimore, Colin announced the album would in fact be released on March 24, 2009. During his 2008 tour of the United States, Colin Meloy played several new songs that may be included on the next album, while the full band premiered new songs during their performance at a 2008 [[Barack Obama]] rally in Portland, in front of 75,000 attendees.

In a post on [[Rolling Stone]]'s Rock 'n' Roll Daily blog, the band revealed more details about the upcoming album.<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/11/18/in-the-studio-the-decemberists-return-with-fairy-tale-album/</ref>
