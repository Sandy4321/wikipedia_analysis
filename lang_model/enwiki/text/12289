'''Ernest Fox Nichols''' (June 1, 1869&ndash; April 29, 1924) was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] educator and [[physicist]].  He was born in [[Leavenworth County]], [[Kansas]], and received his undergraduate degree from [[Kansas State University]] in 1888.  After working for a year in the Chemistry Department at Kansas State, he matriculated to graduate school at [[Cornell University]], where he received degrees in 1893 and 1897.  He also studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].

Nichols served as a professor of physics at [[Colgate University]] from 1892-1898, at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1898-1903, and [[Columbia University]] from 1903-1909.  Thereafter, Nichols served as the 10th President of Dartmouth College between 1909 and 1916, and as the president of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] from 1921 until 1923.

Nichols was awarded the [[Rumford Prize]] by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1905 for his proof that [[Nichols radiometer|light exerts pressure]].  He was also elected Vice President of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

==Dartmouth Presidency==

The appointment of Ernest Fox Nichols as the 10th president in the Wheelock Succession could be seen as both a reflection of the times and a tribute to the quality of Dartmouth's faculty. A member of the physics department and its chair at the time of his appointment, Nichols' pioneering work in the measurement of [[radiation]] expanded the frontiers of knowledge at the end of the 19th century. He was the first Dartmouth president since [[John Wheelock]] who was not a member of the [[clergy]], yet his deep appreciation of the importance of broad-based scholarship to the moral and spiritual growth of students was internationally recognized. 

Many of the College's most cherished institutions and traditions took shape during the Nichols administration, including the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] and [[Dartmouth Winter Carnival|Winter Carnival]]. In addition, to improve communications between Dartmouth and its growing body of graduates, President Nichols established the [[Dartmouth Council of Alumni]].

Ernest Fox Nichols stepped down in 1916 to become a professor of physics at [[Yale University]] and subsequently became president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/features/succession/nichols.html Posted with Permission from Dartmouth College]
