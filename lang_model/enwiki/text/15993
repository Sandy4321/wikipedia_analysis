'''Miles Morales''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] comic book superhero who appears in books published by [[Marvel Comics]], in particular the monthly series ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]''. The character was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Sara Pichelli]], though both Bendis and Marvel editor-in-chief [[Axel Alonso]] were inspired by a number of ideas, such as the election U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and the appearance of African American actor [[Donald Glover]] in Spider-Man pajamas in the [[Anthropology 101|second season premiere]] of the TV series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]''.

Miles Morales first appeared in ''Ultimate Fallout'' #4 (August 2011), following the death of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. A teenager of [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|African American and Latino]] descent, Miles is the second '''[[Spider-Man]]''' in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity.<ref name=Truitt0819>{{cite news |last=Truitt |first=Brian |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-08-01-black-spider-man_n.htm |title=Half-black, half-Hispanic Spider-Man revealed |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/614OVWKBN |archivedate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> Although Morales features in the Ultimate Spider-Man comic book series, he is not the lead character in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated TV series that debuted in April 2012 on [[Disney XD]].<ref>[http://insidepulse.com/2011/08/06/marvels-new-ultimate-spider-man-miles-morales-a-significant-and-safe-leap-forward/ "Marvel<U+2019>s New Ultimate Spider-Man Miles Morales: A Significant And Safe Leap Forward"]. Inside Pulse. August 4, 2011</ref> Reaction to the character varied, with some approving the creation of a positive role model for minority children, including the original Spider-Man's creator, [[Stan Lee]], to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by [[political correctness]], a charge Alonso denied. Alexandra Petri of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called for the character to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.

The character possesses powers similar to those of the original Spider-Man, which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis, Norman Osborn, in an attempt to duplicate those very abilities.

==Publication history==
The concept of an African American [[Spider-Man]] was first discussed a few months before the November 2008 [[United States presidential election, 2008|election]] of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States]]. [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Axel Alonso]] said, "We realized that we were standing at the brink of America elected (sic) its first African American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good look at one of our icons".<ref name=LatinRapper>{{cite web |title=Axel Alonso: Reinventing Today's Heroes |publisher=LatinRapper.com |date=August 8, 2011 |url=http://www.latinrapper.com/axel-alonso-interview.html |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/610OqAiUw |archivedate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> This new Spider-Man was considered a possible part of the 2008-09 "[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]" story arc that restructured much of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed.<ref name=LatinRapper/> Bendis said thoughts about the character were further reinforced by African American actor [[Donald Glover]]'s appearance wearing Spider-Man pajamas on "[[Anthropology 101]]", the [[Community (season 2)|second season]] premiere of the television comedy series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]''. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure an audition for the lead role in the upcoming film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Bendis said of Glover, "I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book."<ref name=USAToday>{{cite news |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title=A TV comedy assured new Spidey's creator |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 2, 2011 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-08-02-new-spider-man-inside_n.htm |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/614NnHFPG |archivedate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>

[[Image:First image of miles morales spider man.jpg|thumb|215 px|left|The first appearance of Miles Morales as Spider-Man, from the fourth issue of the ''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'' series in August 2011.]]
When the [[Marvel Comics]] staff decided that the Ultimate universe's [[Alternate versions of Spider-Man#Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] would be killed in the 2011 storyline [[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man#"Death of Spider-Man"|"Death of Spider-Man"]], the character Miles Morales was created.<ref name=USAToday/> Miles Morales was created by comic book writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist Sara Pichelli.<ref name=LatinRapper/><ref name=WashPost8.16.11>{{cite news |last=Cavna |first=Michael |title=Miles Morales: Check out Sara Pichelli inking the new Ultimate Spider-Man |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 16, 2011 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/miles-morales-check-out-sara-pichelli-inking-the-new-ultimate-spider-man/2011/08/16/gIQA90qUJJ_blog.html |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61136yjAY |archivedate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> Morales was born and raised in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], the son of an African American father and a Hispanic mother.

Miles Morales first appears in ''Ultimate Comics: Fallout'' #4, which was published in August 2011, in which he foils a murder by [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], a short time after [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s death at the hands of the [[Green Goblin]]. He wears a red and blue Spider-Man suit similar to Peter Parker's, but considers changing it when spectators tell him it is in "bad taste".<ref name=Fallout4>{{cite news |last=Schedeen|first=Jesse |title=Ultimate Comics: Fallout #4 Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=August 3, 2011 |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/118/1186020p1.html |accessdate=August 20, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/614R6Yq0S|archivedate=August 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=This Week In Geek: Different Shades of Spider-Man |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=August 16, 2011|url=http://www.nowsaltlake.com/articles/view/1580|accessdate=August 20, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/614RK3UVO|archivedate=August 20, 2011}}</ref>

The opening story arc of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' volume 2, which premiered in September 2011, is set prior to ''Ultimate Fallout'' #4, and details how Miles received his superhuman abilities. Osborn's scientist, Dr. Markus uses Parker's blood to recreate the Oz formula that created Spider-Man, the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Aaron Davis<ref name=UltSpidey5>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=5|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis]]|artist=[[Sara Pichelli]] and David Messina|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=February 2012}}</ref>) steals the formula, and in the process, one of the spiders created by Markus, crawls into the Prowler's duffel bag. Days later, the Prowler's nephew,<ref name=UltSpidey1>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=1|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|artist=Sara Pichelli|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=November 2011}}</ref> gradeschooler<ref name=UltSpidey5/> Miles Morales, is bitten by the spider during a visit to Davis' apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter Parker has,<ref name=UltSpidey1/>  but only confides in his best friend, Ganke,<ref name=UltSpidey2>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=2|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|artist=Sara Pichelli|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=November 2011}}</ref> due to his father's distrust of superheroes.<ref name=UltSpidey2/> 

Miles, who just wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and initially nauseated at the idea of risking his life to engage in superheroics as Parker did.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=3|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|artist=Sara Pichelli|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2011}}</ref>  However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death at the hands of the Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from [[Gwen Stacy]] why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting.<ref name=UltSpidey4>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=4|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|artist=Sara Pichelli|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=January 2012}}</ref> During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste,<ref name=Fallout4/><ref name=UltSpidey4/> but also by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)#Ultimate Comics|Spider-Woman]], a member of the government superhuman team, the [[Ultimates]], over his use of the Spider-Man identity.<ref name=UltSpidey4/>

Spider-Woman unmasks and arrests Miles and takes him to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters, where [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] reveals that he knows all about Miles and his family, including his uncle's criminal activity. After helping S.H.I.E.L.D. subdue the escaped supervillain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Electro|Electro]], S.H.I.E.L.D. releases Miles, and gives him a modified black and red version of the Spider-Man costume, which Ganke feels makes Miles "officially" the new Spider-Man.<ref name=UltSpidey5/> After the newspapers begin reporting the emergence of a new Spider-Man, Aaron deduces that it is really Miles,<ref name=UltSpidey6-7>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=6-7|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|artist=Chris Samnee|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March<U+2013>April 2012}}</ref> and confronts Miles with this knowledge.<ref name=UltSpidey8>{{cite comic|title=Ultimate Spider-Man|volume=2|issue=8|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|artist=Sara Pichelli|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=May 2012}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bitten by a slightly different strain of genetically engineered spider than that which granted Peter Parker his powers, Miles possesses abilities similar to the original Spider-Man's, including enhanced strength and agility, the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings with his hands and feet,<ref name=UltSpidey2/> and a "[[Spider sense#Spider-sense|spider sense]]" that warns him of danger, which manifests itself as a buzzing sensation in his head, though he had not yet discerned what it was by the end of the first ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' story-arc.<ref name=Fallout4/><ref name="UltSpidey4"/> He also has abilities that the original Spider-Man did not have, including the ability to turn invisible,<ref name=UltSpidey1/> and a "venom strike" that can render people paralyzed with a touch,<ref name=UltSpidey2/> including the electrically powered Electro.<ref name=UltSpidey5/>

The character Miles Morales was first reported by ''[[USA Today]]'' on August 2, 2011, shortly before the character officially debuted in ''Ultimate Fallout'' #4.<ref name=Truitt0819/><ref name="Ching0802"/> The announcement received international coverage in the mainstream media and was met with mixed reactions by audiences.<ref name=FoxNews/> Some fans and commentators felt the decision was an attempt by Marvel Comics to be [[Political correctness|politically correct]] and that the introduction of a minority Spider-Man was simply a [[publicity stunt]] to attract more readers,<ref name=LatinRapper/><ref name=FoxNews/> while others felt that a non-Caucasian Spider-Man would set a positive example for minority readers, particularly children.<ref name=WashPost8.3.11>{{cite news |last=Petri |first=Alexandra |title=Sorry, Peter Parker.

The response to the black Spider-Man shows why we need one", in which writer Alexandra Petri wrote that the character should be judged on the quality of its stories rather than on his appearance or ethnicity.<ref name=WashPost8.3.11/> 

Prominent radio host and conservative pundit [[Lou Dobbs]] expressed outrage over the original Spider-Man being replaced by the new biracial hero. Political comedian [[Jon Stewart]] subsequently mocked Dobbs' reaction on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', while also pointing out that Morales replaced Spider-Man only in the Ultimate universe, and that the original Peter Parker would still be appearing in several titles.<ref>MacNicol, Glynnis.

''[[Business Insider]]''. August 5, 2011</ref> Similarly, conservative talkshow host [[Glenn Beck]], claiming that Miles resembled President Barack Obama, complained that the new Spider-Man was a result of a comment from [[Michelle Obama]] about changing traditions. However, unlike Dobbs, Beck said he did not care about Miles' race, and also acknowledged out that this was not the mainstream Spider-Man.<ref>Hudson, Laura.

[[Comics Alliance]]. August 4, 2011</ref> Axel Alonso denied the character was created out of political correctness: "Simple fact is Marvel comics reflect the world in all its shapes, sizes and colors. We believe there's an audience of people out there who is thirsty for a character like Miles Morales."<ref name=LatinRapper/> Original Spider-Man creator [[Stan Lee]] approved of Miles, stating that "Doing our bit to try to make our nation, and the world, color blind is definitely the right thing."<ref name="NyDailyNews">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/marvel-comics-brings-special-versions-spider-man-including-dead-ringer-a-rod-article-1.1059630|title=Marvel Comics brings together its two special versions of 'Spider-Man' in special summer miniseries event|author=Sacks, Ethan}}</ref>

In a review for the first issue, David Pepose of [[Newsarama]] wrote that "the biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about him quickly. Even though we're still scratching the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. But that kind of Parker-style guilt <U+2014> that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility <U+2014> is still intact."<ref>{{cite news| last=Pepose| first=David| title=Best Shots Extra: ULTIMATE COMICS SPIDER-MAN #1| work=Newsarama|date=14 September 2011| url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/best-shots-extra-110914.html}}</ref> Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] wrote that "Miles still feels like a bit of an outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles - his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." Schedeen also opined that "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's".<ref>{{cite news| last=Schedeen| first=Jesse| title=Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #1 Review| work=IGN|date=14 September 2011| url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/119/1194252p1.html}}</ref>
