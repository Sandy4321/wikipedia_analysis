{{Economics sidebar}}
The '''history of economic thought''' deals with different thinkers and theories in the subject that became [[political economy]] and [[economics]] from the [[ancient world]] to the present day. It encompasses many disparate [[schools of economic thought]]. Ancient Greek writers such as the philosopher [[Aristotle]] examined ideas about the art of wealth acquisition, and questioned whether property is best left in private or public hands. In medieval times, [[Scholasticism|Scholastic scholars]] such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that it was a [[Morality|moral]] obligation of businesses to sell goods at a [[just price]].

Since medieval times, economics was developed almost exclusively in the West until the 20th century.

Scottish philosopher [[Adam Smith]] is often cited as "the Father of Modern Economics" for his treatise ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776).<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=2008-05-14 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/07/08/reviews/010708.08mattict.html |title=Who Is the Real Adam Smith? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-07-08 |author=Mattick, Paul }}</ref><ref name=HoaasMadigan1999>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hoaas  | first1 = David J.  | last2 = Madigan | first2 = Lauren J.  | author1-link = David J.

ISBN 978-0-521-57701-4 p. 34</ref>

Smith's successors included such [[Classical economics|classical economists]] as [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. They examined ways the landed, capitalist, and laboring classes produced and distributed national output and [[Model (economics)|modeled]] the effects of [[An Essay on the Principle of Population|population]] and [[international trade]]. In London, [[Karl Marx]] castigated the capitalist system, which he described as exploitative and alienating. From about 1870, [[neoclassical economics]] attempted to erect a positive, mathematical, and scientifically grounded field above normative politics.

After the two world wars of the early twentieth century, [[John Maynard Keynes]] led a reaction against [[laissez faire|governmental abstention]] from economic affairs, advocating interventionist fiscal policy to stimulate economic demand and growth. With a world divided between the [[capitalism|capitalist]] first world, the [[communist]] second world, and the poor of the [[Third World]], the [[post-war consensus]] broke down. Others like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] warned of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' and the unworkability of [[socialism]], focusing their theories on what could be achieved through better [[Monetarism|monetary policy]] and deregulation.

As [[Keynesian]] policies seemed to falter in the 1970s, there emerged [[New classical macroeconomics|New Classical Macroeconomics]], developed by prominent theorists including [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], and [[Edward C. Prescott]], who tried to provide neoclassical microeconomic mechanisms to help analyze macroeconomic issues. [[New Keynesian]] economists including [[Paul Krugman]], [[Edmund Phelps]], [[John B. Taylor]] and [[Huw Dixon]] responded to their critiques, eventually leading to the [[new neoclassical synthesis|New Neoclassical Synthesis]] in macroeconomics. Meanwhile [[Development economics|development economists]] like [[Amartya Sen]], and [[Information economics|information economists]] like [[Joseph Stiglitz]] introduced new ideas to economic thought.

==Ancient Economic Thought==
{{Main|Ancient economic thought|Chanakya|Xenophon|Oeconomicus|Fan Li|Qin Shihuang|Wang Anshi|Muqaddimah|Arthashastra|Economics of Mahavira}}

The earliest discussions of economics date back to ancient times, e.g. [[Xenophon]]'s [[Oeconomicus]] (ca. 360 BCE) and [[Chanakya]]'s (ca. 350-283 BCE) [[Arthashastra]]. Until the 18th-19th century [[Industrial Revolution]] in the West, economics was not a separate discipline but part of philosophy.

===Plato and Aristotle===
{{Main|Plato|Republic (dialogue)|Credit theory of money|Aristotle|Politics (Aristotle)|Nicomachean Ethics|Metallism}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Plato]] and his pupil [[Aristotle]] had had an enduring effect on [[Western philosophy]].]]

[[Ancient Athens]] was a slave-based society, but also one developing an embryonic model of democracy.

<ref>David Held, ''Models of Democracy'' (Polity, 2006) 3rd Ed., pp. 11 ff.</ref> [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (ca. 380-360 BCE) described the ideal city-state, run by philosopher-kings, and contained references to specialization of labor and production. Plato was the first to advocate the [[Credit theory of money|Credit Theory of Money]], that money originated as a unit of account for debt.

Plato's student [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (ca. 350 BCE) was mainly concerned to analyze different forms of a state ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], [[Constitution|constitutional government]], [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]]) as a critique of Plato's advocacy of a ruling class of philosopher-kings. In particular for economists, Plato had drawn a blueprint of society on the basis of common ownership of resources. Aristotle viewed this model as an oligarchical [[anathema]]. In ''Politics'', Book II, Part V, he argued that:

{{quote|"Property should be in a certain sense common, but, as a general rule, private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest, men will not complain of one another, and they will make more progress, because every one will be attending to his own business... And further, there is the greatest pleasure in doing a kindness or service to friends or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a man has private property. These advantages are lost by excessive unification of the state."<ref name="Book II, Part V">Aristotle (350 BCE) ''Politics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html Book II, Part V]</ref>}}

Though Aristotle certainly advocated there be many things held in common, he argued that not everything could be, simply because of the "wickedness of human nature".<ref name="Book II, Part V"/> "It is clearly better that property should be private", wrote Aristotle, "but the use of it common; and the special business of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition." In ''Politics'' Book I, Aristotle discusses the general nature of households and market exchanges. For him there is a certain "art of acquisition" or "wealth-getting", but because it is the same many people are obsessed with its accumulation, and "wealth-getting" for one's household is "necessary and honorable", while exchange on the retail trade for simple accumulation is "justly censured, for it is dishonorable".<ref>Aristotle (350 BCE) ''Politics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html Book I, Part X]</ref> Of the people he stated they as a whole thought acquisition of wealth (chrematistike) as being either the same as, or a principle of oikonomia (''household management'' <U+2013> oikonomos),<ref>Book I, Part III]</ref><ref name=" ">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ekqCOGr1_NAC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=household+management+-+Ancient+Greek#v=onepage&q=household%20management%20-%20Ancient%20Greek&f=false |author=M.

Aristotle discarded Plato's credit theory of money for [[Metallism]], the theory that money derives its value from the purchasing power of the commodity upon which it is based, and is only an "instrument", its sole purpose being a medium of exchange, which means on its own "it is worthless... not useful as a means to any of the necessities of life".<ref>Aristotle (350 BCE) ''Politics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html Book I, Part IX]</ref>

==Economic Thought in the Middle Ages==
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas|Scholasticism|Duns Scotus|Ibn Khaldun|Islamic economic jurisprudence}}

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 052.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Thomas Aquinas (1225<U+2013>74) taught that raising prices in response to high demand was a type of theft.]]

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225<U+2013>1274) was an Italian theologian and writer on economic issues. He taught in both [[Cologne]] and Paris, and was part of a group of Catholic scholars known as the [[Schoolmen]], who moved their enquiries beyond theology to philosophical and scientific debates. In the treatise ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' Aquinas dealt with the concept of a [[just price]], which he considered necessary for the reproduction of the social order. Bearing many similarities with the modern concept of long run equilibrium a just price was supposed to be one just sufficient to cover the [[costs of production]], including the maintenance of a worker and his family. He argued it was immoral for sellers to raise their prices simply because buyers were in pressing need for a product.

Aquinas discusses a number of topics in the format of questions and replies, substantial tracts dealing with Aristotle's theory. Questions 77 and 78 concern economic issues, mainly relate to what a [[just price]] is, and to the fairness of a seller dispensing faulty goods. Aquinas argued against any form of cheating and recommended compensation always be paid in lieu of good service. Whilst human laws might not impose sanctions for unfair dealing, [[divine law]] did, in his opinion.

===Duns Scotus===
[[File:John Duns Scotus - geograph.org.uk - 1178460.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Duns Scotus (1206<U+2013>1308)]]

One of Aquinas' main critics<ref name="Mochrie 2005 p.5">Mochrie (2005) p. 5</ref> was [[Duns Scotus]] (1265<U+2013>1308), originally from [[Duns]] Scotland, who taught in Oxford, Cologne, and Paris.  In his work ''[[Sententiae]]'' (1295), he thought it possible to be more precise than Aquinas in calculating a just price, emphasizing the costs of labor and expenses, although he recognized that the latter might be inflated by exaggeration because buyer and seller usually have different ideas of what a just price comprises. If people did not benefit from a transaction, in Scotus' view, they would not trade.  Scotus defended merchants as performing a necessary and useful social role, transporting goods and making them available to the public.<ref name="Mochrie 2005 p.5"/>

===Ibn Khaldun===
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun-Kassus.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ibn Khaldun (1332<U+2013>1406)]]

Until [[Joseph J. Spengler]]'s 1964 work "Economic Thought of Islam: Ibn Khaldun", [[Adam Smith]] (1723<U+2013>1790) was believed to be the "Father of Economics".  Now there is a second candidate, Arab Muslim scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332<U+2013>1406) of Tunisia, although how the Muslim world fell behind the West, or what influence Khaldun had in the West is unclear.

[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|thumb|left|120px|A 1638 painting of a French seaport during the heyday of [[mercantilism]].]]

Despite the [[Localism (politics)|localism]] of the Middle Ages, the waning of [[Feudalism]] saw new national economic frameworks begin to be strengthened.  After the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] et al. opened up new opportunities for trade with the [[New World]] and Asia, newly-powerful monarchies wanted a more powerful military state to boost their status.  [[Mercantilism]] was a political movement and an economic theory that advocated the use of the state's military power to ensure that local markets and supply sources were protected, spawning [[Protectionism]].

[[File:Mirabeau p<U+00E8>re.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Marquis de Mirabeau (1715<U+2013>89)]]

Mercantile theorists thought that [[international trade]] could not benefit all countries at the same time.  Because money and precious metals were the only source of riches, there was a limited quantity of resources to be shared between countries, therefore, [[tariff]]s should be used to encourage exports (bringing more money into the country) and discourage imports (sending money abroad).  In other words a positive [[balance of trade]] ought to be maintained via a surplus of exports, often backed by military might.  Despite its prevalence, the term mercantilism was not coined until 1763 by [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]] (1715<U+2013>1789), and popularized by [[Adam Smith]] in 1776, who vigorously opposed its ideas.

===School of Salamanca===
{{Main|School of Salamanca}}

In the 16th century the Jesuit [[School of Salamanca]] in Spain developed economic theory to a high level, only to have their contributions forgotten until the 20th century.

===Sir Thomas More===

In 1516 English humanist [[Sir Thomas More]] (1478-1535) published 
''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', which describes an ideal society where land is owned in common and there is universal education and religious tolerance, inspiring the [[English poor laws|English Poor Laws]] (1587) and the communism-socialism movement.

===Nicolaus Copernicus===

In 1517 Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473-1543) published the first known argument for the [[Quantity theory of money|Quantity Theory of Money]]. In 1519 he published the first known form of [[Gresham's law|Gresham's Law]]: "Bad money drives out good".

[[File:Jean Bodin.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Jean Bodin (1530-96)]]

In 1568 [[Jean Bodin]] (1530-1596) of France published ''Reply to Malestroit'', containing the first known analysis of economic inflation, which he claimed was being caused by the importation of gold and silver from South America, backing the Quantity Theory of Money.

===Barth<U+00E9>lemy de Laffemas===

In 1598 French mercantilist economist [[Barth<U+00E9>lemy de Laffemas]] (1545-1612) published ''Les Tr<U+00E9>sors et richesses pour mettre l'Estat en splendeur'', which blasted those who frowned on French silks because the industry created employment for the poor, the first known mention of [[Underconsumption|Underconsumption Theory]], which is later refined by [[John Maynard Keynes]].

===Leonardus Lessius===

[[File:Leonardus Lessius (1554-1623).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Leonardus Lessius (1554-1623)]]

In 1605 Flemish Jesuit theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]] (1554-1623) published ''On Justice and Law'', the deepest moral-theological study of economics since Aquinas, whose just price approach he claimed was no longer workable. After comparing money's growth via avarice to the propagation of hares, he made the first statement of the price of insurance as being based on risk.

===Edward Misselden and Gerard Malynes===
{{Main|Edward misselden|Gerard Malynes}}

In 1622 English merchants [[Edward misselden|Edward Misselden]] and [[Gerard Malynes]] began a dispute over free trade and the desirability of government regulation of companies, with Malynes arguing against foreign exchange as under the control of bankers, and Misselden arguing that international money exchange and fluctuations in the exchange rate depend upon international trade and not bankers, and that the state should regulate trade to insure export surpluses.

===Thomas Mun===
{{Main|Thomas Mun}}

English economist [[Thomas Mun]] (1571<U+2013>1641) describes early mercantilist policy in his book ''England's Treasure by Foreign Trade'', which was not published until 1664, although it was widely circulated in manuscript form during his lifetime.  Mun was a member of the [[East India Company]], writing about his experiences in ''A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East Indies'' (1621).

According to Mun, trade was the only way to increase England's treasure (national wealth), and in pursuit of this end he suggested several courses of action.  Important were frugal consumption to increase the amount of goods available for export, increased utilization of land and other domestic natural resources to reduce import requirements, lowering of export duties on goods produced domestically from foreign materials, and the export of goods with [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]] demand because more money could be made from higher prices.

===Sir William Petty===

[[File:Sir William Petty.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Sir William Petty (1623-87)]]

In 1662 English economist [[William Petty|Sir William Petty]] (1623-1687) began publishing short works applying the rational scientific tradition of [[Francis Bacon]] to economics, requiring that it only use measurable phenomena and seek quantitative precision, coining the term "political arithmetic", introducing statistical mathematics, and becoming the first scientific economist.

===Philipp von H<U+00F6>rnigk===

[[File:<U+00D6>sterreich uber alles wann es nur will.jpg|thumb|right|120px|The title page to [[Philipp von H<U+00F6>rnigk]] statement of mercantilist philosophy.]]

[[Philipp von H<U+00F6>rnigk]] (1640<U+2013>1712, sometimes spelt ''Hornick'' or ''Horneck'') was born in [[Frankfurt]] and became an Austrian civil servant writing in a time when his country was constantly threatened by [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars|Ottoman invasion]].  In ''<U+00D6>sterreich <U+00DC>ber Alles, Wann es Nur Will'' (1684, ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'') he laid out one of the clearest statements of mercantile policy, listing nine principal rules of national economy:

{{quote|"To inspect the country's soil with the greatest care, and not to leave the agricultural possibilities of a single corner or clod of earth unconsidered... All commodities found in a country, which cannot be used in their natural state, should be worked up within the country... Attention should be given to the population, that it may be as large as the country can support... gold and silver once in the country are under no circumstances to be taken out for any purpose... The inhabitants should make every effort to get along with their domestic products... [Foreign commodities] should be obtained not for gold or silver, but in exchange for other domestic wares... and should be imported in unfinished form, and worked up within the country... Opportunities should be sought night and day for selling the country's superfluous goods to these foreigners in manufactured form... No importation should be allowed under any circumstances of which there is a sufficient supply of suitable quality at home."}}

[[Nationalism]], self-sufficiency and national power were the basic policies proposed.<ref>Fusfeld (1994) p. 15</ref>

===Jean-Baptiste Colbert and Pierre Le Pesant, Sieur de Boisguilbert===

[[File:Colbert mg 8447 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619<U+2013>83)]]

In 1665-1683 [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (1619<U+2013>1683) was minister of finance under King [[Louis XIV of France]], setting up national [[guild]]s to regulate major industries.  Silk, linen, tapestry, furniture manufacture and wine were examples of the crafts in which France specialized, all of which came to require membership of a guild to operate in until the [[French revolution|French Revolution]].  According to Colbert, "It is simply and solely the abundance of money within a state [which] makes the difference in its grandeur and power."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[File:Boisguilbert.gif|thumb|right|100px|Pierre Le Pesant, Sieur de Boisguilbert (1646-1714)]]

In 1695 French economist [[Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert]] (1646-1714) wrote a plea to Louis XIV to end Colbert's mercantilist program, containing the first notion of an economical market, becoming the first economist to question the economic policy of mercantilism and value the wealth of a country by its production and exchange of goods instead of the amount of money it has.

===Charles Davenant===

In 1767 Scottish mercantilist economist [[Sir James Steuart]] (1713-1780) published ''An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', the first book in English with the term "political economy" in the title, and the first complete economics treatise.

==The British Enlightenment==
{{See also|Age of enlightenment|Scottish enlightenment|Thomas Hobbes|William Petty}}

In the 17th century Britain went through some of its most troubling times, enduring not only the political and religious division of the [[English Civil War]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I's]] execution, and the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian dictatorship]], but also the [[Great Plague of London]] and [[Great Fire of London]]. The monarchy was restored under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who had Roman Catholic sympathies, leading to turmoil and strife, but his Catholic-leaning successor [[James II of England|King James II]] was swiftly ousted. Invited in his place were Protestant [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]], who assented to the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], ensuring that the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was dominant in what became known as the [[Glorious revolution|Glorious Revolution]].

The upheaval was accompanied by a number of major scientific advances, including [[Robert Boyle]]'s discovery of the [[Boyle's law|gas pressure constant]] (1660) and Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s publication of ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), which described Newton's Laws of Motion and his Universal Law of Gravitation.

All these factors spurred the advancement of economic thought. For instance, [[Richard Cantillon]] (1680<U+2013>1734) consciously imitated Newton's forces of inertia and gravity in the natural world with human reason and market competition in the economic world.<ref name="Fusfeld 1994 p.21">Fusfeld (1994) p. 21</ref> In his ''Essay on the Nature of Commerce in General'', he argued rational self-interest in a system of freely-adjusting markets would lead to order and mutually-compatible prices. Unlike the mercantilist thinkers however, wealth was found not in trade but in human [[Labour theory of value|labor]]. The first person to tie these ideas into a political framework was John Locke.

===John Locke===
{{Main|John Locke}}

[[File:JohnLocke.png|upright|thumb|100px|John Locke (1632<U+2013>1704) combined [[philosophy]], [[politics]] and [[economics]] into [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|one]] coherent framework.]]

[[John Locke]] (1632<U+2013>1704) was born near Bristol, and educated in London and Oxford. He is considered one of the most significant philosophers of his era mainly for his critique of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' defense of absolutism in ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) and the development of [[social contract theory]]. Locke believed that people contracted into society, which was bound to protect their property rights.<ref>Locke (1689) [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]</ref> He defined property broadly to include people's lives and liberties, as well as their wealth. When people combined their labor with their surroundings, that created property rights. In his words from his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' (1689):

{{quote|"God hath given the world to men in common... Yet every man has a property in his own person. The labour of his body and the work of his hands we may say are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property."<ref>Locke (1689) [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#Chap. V. Of Property.|Chapter 5, sections 26<U+2013>27]].</ref>}}

Locke was arguing that not only should the government cease interference with people's property (or their "lives, liberties and estates"), but also that it should positively work to ensure their protection. His views on price and money were laid out in a letter to a [[Member of Parliament]] in 1691 entitled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money'' (1691), arguing that the "price of any commodity rises or falls, by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers", a rule which "holds universally in all things that are to be bought and sold."<ref>Locke (1691) ''Considerations'' Part I, Thirdly</ref>

===Dudley North===
{{Main|Dudley North (economist)}}
[[File:Dudley North.jpg|thumb|100px|Dudley North (1641<U+2013>91) argued that the results of mercantile policy would be undesirable.]]

[[Dudley North (economist)|Dudley North]] (1641<U+2013>1691) was a wealthy merchant and landowner. He worked as an official for the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] and was opposed to most mercantile policy. In his ''Discourses upon trade'' (1691), which he published anonymously, he argued that the assumption of the necessity of a favorable trade balance was wrong. Trade, he argued, benefits both sides, it promotes [[specialization (functional)|specialization]], the [[division of labor]] and produces an increase in wealth for everyone. [[Regulation]] of trade interfered with these benefits by reducing the flow of wealth.

===David Hume===
{{Main|David Hume}}

[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|left|100px|David Hume (1711<U+2013>76)]]

[[David Hume]] (1711<U+2013>1776) agreed with North's philosophy and denounced [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] assumptions. His contributions were set down in ''Political Discourses'' (1752), and later consolidated in his ''Essays, Moral, Political, Literary'' (1777). Added to the fact that it was undesirable to strive for a favourable [[balance of trade]] it is, said Hume, in any case impossible.

Hume held that any surplus of [[export]]s that might be achieved would be paid for by imports of gold and silver. This would increase the [[money supply]], causing prices to rise. That in turn would cause a decline in exports until the balance with imports is restored.

==The Physiocrats and the Circular Flow==
{{Main|Physiocracy}}
{{See also|Bernard Mandeville|John Law (economist)|Pierre le Pesant de Boisguilbert|Victor de Riqueti}}

Similarly disenchanted with regulation on trademarks inspired by mercantilism, a Frenchman name [[Vincent de Gournay]] (1712<U+2013>1759) is reputed to have asked why it was so hard to ''[[laissez faire]] ("let it be"), laissez passer'' ("let it pass"), advocating free enterprise and free trade. He was one of the early [[Physiocracy|Physiocrats]], a Greek word meaning "Government of nature", who held that agriculture was the source of wealth. As historian [[David B. Danbom]] wrote, the Physiocrats "damned cities for their artificiality and praised more natural styles of living. They celebrated farmers."<ref>Danbom (1997) Rural Development Perspectives, vol. 12, no. 1 [http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/rdp/rdp1096/rdp1096d.pdf p. 15] ''[[Why Americans Value Rural Life]]'' by David B. Danbom</ref> Over the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century big advances in [[natural science]] and [[anatomy]] were being made, including the discovery of [[blood circulation]] through the human body. This concept was mirrored in the physiocrats' economic theory, with the notion of a [[circular flow of income]] throughout the economy.

[[File:Fran<U+00E7>ois Quesnay.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Francois Quesnay (1694<U+2013>1774).]]

[[Fran<U+00E7>ois Quesnay]] (1694<U+2013>1774) was the court physician to King [[Louis XV of France]]. He believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his book ''[[Tableau <U+00E9>conomique]]'' (1758, Economic Table) argued that agricultural surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages, and purchases were the real economic movers. Firstly, said Quesnay, regulation impedes the flow of income throughout all [[social classes]] and therefore economic development. Secondly, taxes on the productive classes, such as [[farmer]]s, should be reduced in favour of rises for unproductive classes, such as [[landowner]]s, since their luxurious way of life distorts the income flow. David Ricardo later showed that taxes on land are non-transferable to tenants in his [[Law of Rent]].

[[File:Thomas Bayes.gif|thumb|left|100px|Thomas Bayes (1701-61)]]

In 1761 English Presbyterian minister [[Thomas Bayes]] (1701-1761) died, leaving an article describing [[Bayes' Theorem]] of conditional probabilities, which was generalized by statisticians and widely adopted by economists.

[[File:Anne Robert Jacques Turgot.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727<U+2013>81).]]

[[Jacques Turgot]] (1727<U+2013>1781) was born in Paris and from an old [[Normans|Norman]] family. His best known work, ''R<U+00E9>flexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses'' (''Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth'') (1766) developed Quesnay's theory that [[land (economics)|land]] is the only source of [[wealth]]. Turgot viewed society in terms of three classes: the productive agricultural class, the salaried artisan class (''classe stipendice'') and the landowning class (''classe disponible''). He argued that only the net product of land should be taxed and advocated the complete freedom of [[commerce]] and [[industry]].

In August 1774 Turgot was appointed to be minister of finance, and in the space of two years he introduced many anti-mercantile and anti-feudal measures supported by the king. A statement of his guiding principles, given to the king were "no [[bankruptcy]], no [[tax]] increases, no borrowing." Turgot's ultimate wish was to have a single tax on land and abolish all other indirect taxes, but measures he introduced before that were met with overwhelming opposition from landed interests. Two [[edict]]s in particular, one suppressing [[corv<U+00E9>e]]s (charges from farmers to aristocrats) and another renouncing privileges given to guilds inflamed influential opinion. He was forced from office in 1776.

==Adam Smith and ''The Wealth of Nations''==

[[File:Adamsmithout.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Adam Smith (1723<U+2013>1790), father of modern [[political economy]].]]

[[Adam Smith]] (1723<U+2013>1790) is popularly seen as the father of modern political economy. His 1776 publication ''[[An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' happened to coincide not only with the [[American Revolution]], shortly before the Europe-wide upheavals of the [[French Revolution]], but also the dawn of a new [[industrial revolution]] that allowed more wealth to be created on a larger scale than ever before.

Smith was a Scottish moral philosopher, whose first book was ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759). He argued in it that people's ethical systems develop through personal relations with other individuals, that right and wrong are sensed through others' reactions to one's behaviour. This gained Smith more popularity than his next work, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', which the general public initially ignored.<ref name="Fusfeld 1994 p.24">Fusfeld (1994) p. 24</ref> Yet Smith's [[Political economy|political economic]] [[magnum opus]] was successful in circles that mattered.

| style="text-align: left;" | '''Adam Smith's famous statement on self-interest'''
|}

Smith argued for a "[[system of natural liberty]]"<ref name="Smith 1776 p">Smith (1776) p. 533</ref> where individual effort was the producer of social good. Smith believed even the selfish within society were kept under restraint and worked for the good of all when acting in a competitive market. Prices are often unrepresentative of the true value of goods and services. Following [[John Locke]], Smith thought true value of things derived from the amount of labour invested in them.

{{quote|Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But after the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small part of these with which a man's own labour can supply him. The far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which he can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.<ref>Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN2.html#B.I,%20Ch.5,%20Of%20the%20Real%20and%20Nominal%20Price%20of%20Commodities Book I, Chapter 5], para 1</ref>}}

When the butchers, the brewers and the bakers acted under the restraint of an open market economy, their pursuit of self-interest, thought Smith, paradoxically drives the process to correct real life [[price]]s to their just values. His classic statement on competition goes as follows.

{{quote|When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay... cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want... Some of them will be willing to give more. A competition will begin among them, and the market price will rise... When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages and profit, which must be paid to bring it thither... The market price will sink...<ref>Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN2.html#B.I,%20Ch.7,%20Of%20the%20Natural%20and%20Market%20Price%20of%20Commodities Book I, Chapter 7], para 9</ref>}}

Smith believed that a market produced what he dubbed the "progress of opulence". This involved a chain of concepts, that the [[division of labour]] is the driver of economic efficiency, yet it is limited to the widening process of markets. Both labour division and market widening requires more intensive [[Capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]] by the entrepreneurs and leaders of business and industry. The whole system is underpinned by maintaining the security of [[property]] rights.

===Limitations===
[[File:Wealth of Nations title.jpg|thumb|120px|Adam Smith's title page of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.]]

Smith's vision of a free market economy, based on secure property, capital accumulation, widening markets and a division of labour contrasted with the mercantilist tendency to attempt to "regulate all evil human actions."<ref name="Smith 1776 p"/> Smith believed there were precisely three legitimate functions of government. The third function was...

{{quote|...erecting and maintaining certain public works and certain public institutions, which it can never be for the interest of any individual or small number of individuals, to erect and maintain... Every system which endeavours... to draw towards a particular species of industry a greater share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it... retards, instead of accelerating, the progress of the society toward real wealth and greatness.}}

In addition to the necessity of public leadership in certain sectors Smith argued, secondly, that [[cartel]]s were undesirable because of their potential to limit production and quality of goods and services.<ref>Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN4.html#B.I,%20Ch.10,%20Of%20Wages%20and%20Profit%20in%20the%20Different%20Employments%20of%20Labour%20and%20Stock Book I, Chapter 10], para 82</ref> Thirdly, Smith criticised government support of any kind of [[monopoly]] which always charges the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".<ref>Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN2.html#B.I,%20Ch.7,%20Of%20the%20Natural%20and%20Market%20Price%20of%20Commodities Book I, Chapter 7], para 26</ref> The existence of [[monopoly]] and the potential for [[cartel]]s, which would later form the core of [[competition law]] policy, could distort the benefits of free markets to the advantage of businesses at the expense of [[consumer sovereignty]].

[[Pitt the Younger|William Pitt the Younger]] (1759<U+2013>1806), [[Tory]] [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] in 1783<U+2013>1801 based his tax proposals on Smith's ideas, and advocated [[free trade]] as a devout disciple of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.<ref>Hague (2004) pp. 187, 292</ref> Smith was appointed a commissioner of [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|customs]] and within twenty years Smith had a following of new generation writers who were intent on building the [[science]] of political economy.<ref name="Fusfeld 1994 p.24"/>

===Edmund Burke===
[[File:Edmund Burke2 c.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Edmund Burke (1729<U+2013>1797)]]

Adam Smith expressed an affinity to the opinions of Irish MP [[Edmund Burke]] (1729<U+2013>1797), known widely as a political philosopher:

{{quote|"Burke is the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do without any previous communication having passed between us.<ref>Stephen (1898) p. 8."</ref>}}

Burke was an established political economist himself, known for his book ''[[Thoughts and Details on Scarcity]]''. He was widely critical of liberal politics, and condemned the [[French Revolution]] which began in 1789. In ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790) he wrote that the "age of chivalry is dead, that of sophisters, economists and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever." Smith's contemporary influences included [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Quesnay]] and [[Jacques Turgot]] whom he met on a visit to Paris, and [[David Hume]], his Scottish compatriot. The times produced a common need among thinkers to explain social upheavals of the [[Industrial revolution]] taking place, and in the seeming chaos without the feudal and monarchical structures of Europe, show there was order still.

==Classical Political Economy==
{{Main|Classical economics}}
{{See also|Thomas Edward Cliffe Leslie|Walter Bagehot|Thorold Rogers}}

The [[classical economists]] were referred to as a group for the first time by [[Karl Marx]].<ref>Keynes (1936) Chapter 1, footnote</ref> One unifying part of their theories was the [[labour theory of value]], contrasting to value deriving from a [[general equilibrium]] of supply and demand. These economists had seen the first economic and social transformation brought by the Industrial Revolution: rural depopulation, precariousness, poverty, apparition of a working class.

They wondered about the population growth, because the [[demographic transition]] had begun in Great Britain at that time. They also asked many fundamental questions, about the source of value, the causes of economic growth and the role of money in the economy. They supported a free-market economy, arguing it was a natural system based upon freedom and property. However, these economists were divided and did not make up a unified current of thought.

A notable current within classical economics was [[underconsumption]] theory, as advanced by the [[Birmingham School (economics)|Birmingham School]] and Malthus in the early 19th century. These argued for government action to mitigate unemployment and economic downturns, and was an intellectual predecessor of what later became [[Keynesian economics]] in the 1930s. Another notable school was [[Manchester capitalism]], which advocated free trade, against the previous policy of [[mercantilism]].

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|100px|Jeremy Bentham (1748<U+2013>1832) believed in "the greatest good for the greatest number".]]

Jeremy Bentham (1748<U+2013>1832) was perhaps the most radical thinker of his time, and developed the concept of [[utilitarianism]]. Bentham was an [[atheist]], a [[prison reform]]er, [[animal rights]] activist, believer in [[universal suffrage]], [[free speech]], [[free trade]] and [[health insurance]] at a time when few dared to argue for any. He was schooled rigorously from an early age, finishing university and being called to the bar at 18. His first book, ''A Fragment on Government'' (1776) published anonymously was a trenchant critique of [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries of the laws of England]]''. This gained wide success until it was found that the young Bentham, and not a revered Professor had penned it. In ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1789) Bentham set out his theory of utility.<ref>Bentham (1791) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Bentham/bnthPML1.html#Chapter%20I,%20Of%20the%20Principle%20of%20Utility Chapter I], para I</ref>

The aim of [[Law|legal]] policy must be to decrease misery and suffering so far as possible while producing the greatest happiness for the greatest number.<ref>Bentham (1791) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Bentham/bnthPML2.html#Chapter%20II,%20Of%20Principles%20Adverse%20to%20That%20of%20Utility Chapter II], para I</ref> Bentham even designed a comprehensive methodology for the calculation of aggregate happiness in society that a particular law produced, a [[felicific calculus]].<ref>Bentham (1791) Chapter IV</ref> Society, argued Bentham, is nothing more than the total of individuals,<ref>Bentham (1791) Chapter I, para IV</ref> so that if one aims to produce net social good then one need only to ensure that more pleasure is experienced across the board than pain, regardless of numbers.

For example, a law is proposed to make every bus in the city [[wheel chair]] accessible, but slower moving as a result than its [[Routemaster|predecessors]] because of the [[Bendy bus|new design]]. Millions of bus users will therefore experience a small amount of displeasure (or "pain") in increased traffic and journey times, but a minority of people using wheel chairs will experience a huge amount of pleasure at being able to catch public transport, which outweighs the aggregate displeasure of other users.

Interpersonal comparisons of utility were allowed by Bentham, the idea that one person's vast pleasure can count more than many others' pain. Much criticism later showed how this could be twisted, for instance, would the [[felicific calculus]] allow a vastly happy dictator to outweigh the dredging misery of his exploited populus? Despite Bentham's methodology there were severe obstacles in measuring people's happiness.

===Henry Thornton===
{{Main|Henry Thornton (reformer)}}

In 1802 English banker-economist ("Father of the Modern Central Bank") [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]] (1760-1815) published ''An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain'', which disputed that the 1797 British banking credit crisis was caused by an increase in paper credit, opposing the [[Real bills doctrine|Real Bills Doctrine]] of John Law, Adam Smith et al. that claims that a bank should issue notes only in the discount of "good bills" at not more than 60-day due dates to prevent collapse; the doctrine is "thoroughly discredited" in 1945.

===Jean-Baptiste Say===
{{Main|Jean-Baptiste Say}}
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Say.gif|thumb|100px|[[Say's law|Say's Law]], by Jean-Baptiste Say (1767<U+2013>1832), which states that supply always equals demand, was rarely challenged until the 20th century.]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1767<U+2013>1832) was a Frenchman born in [[Lyon]] who helped popularize Adam Smith's work in France.<ref>Fusfeld (1994) p. 47</ref> His book ''A Treatise on Political Economy'' (1803) contained a brief passage, which later became orthodoxy in political economics until the [[Great Depression]], now known as [[Say's Law]] of markets.  Say argued that there could never be a general deficiency of demand or a general glut of commodities in the whole economy.  People produce things, to fulfill their own wants, rather than those of others, therefore production is not a question of supply, but an indication of producers demanding goods.

Say agreed that a part of the income is saved by the households, but in the long term, savings are invested. Investment and consumption are the two elements of demand, so that production ''is'' demand, so it is impossible for production to outrun demand, or for there to be a "general glut" of supply.  Say also argued that money was neutral, because its sole role is to facilitate exchanges, therefore, people demand money only to buy commodities; "money is a veil".

To sum up these two ideas, Say said "products are exchanged for products".  At most, there will be different economic sectors whose demands are not fulfilled. But over time supplies will shift, businesses will retool for different production and the market will correct itself.  An example of a "general glut" could be unemployment, in other words, too great a supply of workers, and too few jobs.  Say's Law advocates would suggest that this necessarily means there is an excess demand for other products that will correct itself.  This remained a foundation of economic theory until the 1930s.  Say's Law was first put forward by [[James Mill]] (1773<U+2013>1836) in English, and was advocated by [[David Ricardo]], [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]],<ref>Thornton (1802) ''The Paper Credit of Great Britain''</ref> and James Mill's son [[John Stuart Mill]].  However two political economists, [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[Jean Charles L<U+00E9>onard de Sismondi]], were unconvinced.

===Charles Hall===
{{Main|Charles Hall}}

In 1805 English physician [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] (1740-1825) published ''The Effects of Civilization on the People in European States'', which blasted capitalism for being unable to provide for the poor during the famines of 1795-1801, calling for a progressive tax and luxury tax, later drawing praise from Karl Marx.

[[Thomas Malthus]] (1766<U+2013>1834) was a [[Tory]] minister in the United Kingdom Parliament who, in contrast to Jeremy Bentham, believed in strict government abstention from social ills.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/malthus_thomas.shtml Historical figures <U+2013> Thomas Malthus (1766<U+2013>1834)], BBC</ref> Malthus devoted the last chapter of his book ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1820) to rebutting Say's Law, arguing that the economy could stagnate with a lack of "effectual demand" caused by a "general glut" of goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/malthus.htm|title=Thomas Robert Malthus, 1766<U+2013>1834|publisher=The History of Economic Thought Website|quote=Malthus denied the validity of Say's Law and argued that there could be a 'general glut' of goods.  Malthus believed that economic crises were characterized by a general excess supply caused by insufficient consumption.|archiveurl=http://articlescache.org/homepage.newschool.edu/malthus.htm|archivedate=2013-08-08|accessdate=2013-08-08}}</ref>  In that case, wages that total less than the costs of production cannot purchase the total output of industry, causing deflation; price falls decrease incentives to invest, creating a downward spiral.

Malthus is more notorious however for his 1798 work ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', a reply to the popular 1793 work ''[[Political Justice|An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' by [[William Godwin]] (1756-1836), which describes an ideal society based on the assumed perfectibility of the human race.  Malthus argued that all government intervention would ultimately prove futile because of two factors, population growth and limited resources.  "Food is necessary to the existence of man", wrote Malthus.  "The passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state", he added, meaning that the "power of the population is infinitely greater than the power in the Earth to produce subsistence for man."<ref>[http://desip.igc.org/malthus/principles.html "Rationale and Core Principles"], The International Society of Malthus</ref>  Nevertheless growth in population is checked by "misery and vice".  Any increase in wages for the masses would cause only a temporary growth in population, which given the constraints in the supply of the Earth's produce would lead to misery, vice and a corresponding readjustment to the original population.<ref>[http://www.allaboutscience.org/malthus-faq.htm Who is Thomas Malthus?], ALL About Science</ref>  However more labor could mean more economic growth, either one of which was able to be produced by an accumulation of capital.

[[Robert Owen]] (1771<U+2013>1858) was British industrialist who worked to improve the conditions of his workers. He bought textile mills in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]] where he forbade children under ten to work, limited the workday to 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., and provided evening schools for children when they finished. Such meager measures were still substantial improvements, and his business remained solvent through higher productivity, though his pay rates were lower than the national average.<ref>In 1819 this was 9 shillings, 11 pence; Fusfeld (1994) p. 57</ref> In 1816 he published his vision in ''The New View of Society'' during the passage of the [[Factory Acts]], but his attempts from 1824 to begin a new utopian community in [[New Harmony, Indiana]] ended in failure.

===David Ricardo===
{{Main|David Ricardo}}
[[File:Portrait of David Ricardo by Thomas Phillips.jpg|thumb|100px|David Ricardo (1772<U+2013>1823) is renowned for his law of [[comparative advantage]].]]

[[David Ricardo]] (1772<U+2013>1823) was born in London. By the age of 26, he had become a wealthy stock market trader, and bought himself a constituency seat in Ireland to gain a platform in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament's]] [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].<ref>[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/stead.ricardo ''David Ricardo''], Economic History Services</ref> Ricardo's best known work is his ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (1817), which contains his critique of barriers to international trade and a description of the manner the income is distributed in the population. Ricardo made a distinction between the workers, who received a wage fixed to a level at which they can survive, the landowners, who earn a rent, and capitalists, who own capital and receive a profit, a residual part of the income.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/ric.html David Ricardo's Contributions to Economics], The Victorian Web</ref>

If population grows, it becomes necessary to cultivate additional land, whose fertility is lower than that of already cultivated fields, because of the law of decreasing productivity. Therefore, the cost of the production of the wheat increases, as well as the price of the wheat: The rents increase also, the wages, indexed to inflation (because they must allow workers to survive) too. Profits decrease, until the capitalists can no longer invest. The economy, Ricardo concluded, is bound to tend towards a [[Steady state economy|steady state]].

To postpone the steady state, Ricardo advocates to promote international trade to import wheat at a low price to fight landowners. The [[Corn Laws]] of the UK had been passed in 1815, setting a fluctuating system of tariffs to stabilise the price of [[wheat]] in the domestic market. Ricardo argued that raising tariffs, despite being intended to benefit the incomes of farmers, would merely produce a rise in the prices of rents that went into the pockets of landowners.<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Ricardo.html "David Ricardo"], Library of Economics and Liberties</ref>

Furthermore, extra labour would be employed leading to an increase in the cost of wages across the board, and therefore reducing exports and profits coming from overseas business. Economics for Ricardo was all about the relationship between the three "factors of production": [[Land (economics)|land]], [[Workforce|labour]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Ricardo demonstrated mathematically that the [[gains from trade]] could outweigh the perceived advantages of protectionist policy. The idea of [[comparative advantage]] suggests that even if one country is inferior at producing all of its goods than another, it may still benefit from opening its borders since the inflow of goods produced more cheaply than at home, produces a gain for domestic consumers.<ref>[http://articlescache.org/homepage.newschool.edu/ricardo.htm David Ricardo, 1772<U+2013>1823], The History of Economic Thought Website</ref> According then to Ricardo, this concept would lead to a shift in prices, so that eventually England would be producing goods in which its comparative advantages were the highest.

Basing his approach on the [[protectionism|protectionist]] philosophy of U.S. Treasury secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]] (1755-1804), U.S. Senator [[Henry Clay]] (1777-1852) promoted the [[National System|American System]] of developmental capitalism utilizing protective tariffs and government intervention to insure national self-sufficiency. In 1822 Irish-born American economist [[Mathew Carey]] (1760-1839) published ''Essays on Political Economy; or, The Most Certain Means of Promoting the Wealth, Power, Resources, and Happiness of Nations, Applied Particularly to the United States'',<ref>[http://books.google.com/books/about/Essays_on_political_economy.html?id=GyNOAAAAYAAJ]</ref> one of the first treatises favoring [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s protectionist economic policy.

[[File:Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809<U+2013>1865)]]

One Karl Marx's influences was French mutualist anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809<U+2013>1865). While deeply critical of capitalism and in favor of workers' associations to replace it, he also objected to those contemporary socialists who idolized centralized state-run associations. In ''System of Economic Contradictions'' (1846) Proudhon made a wide-ranging critique of capitalism, analyzing the contradictory effects of machinery, competition, property, monopoly and other aspects of the economy.<ref>Proudhon (1846) [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/pjproudhon/system-of-economic-contradictions-1 ''Volume 1'']</ref><ref>Proudhon (1846) [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/pjproudhon/system-of-economic-contradictions-2 ''Volume 2'']</ref> Instead of capitalism, he argued for a mutualist system "based upon equality, <U+2013> in other words, the organization of labor, which involves the negation of political economy and the end of property." In his book ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) he argue that property is [[theft]], a different view than the classical [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], who had written that "partial taxation is a mild form of robbery".<ref>Mill (1848) Book V, Chapter II; Interestingly Mill amended his wording from the 3rd edition in 1852, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630165406/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/ellis.pdf]; see generally, ''Variations in the Editions of J.S. Mill's Principles of Political Economy'', M.A. Ellis, Economic Journal, vol. 16, June 1906, pp. 291<U+2013>302.</ref> However, towards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In the posthumously published ''Theory of Property'', he argued that "property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State."<ref>Copleston, Frederick.

===John Stuart Mill===
{{Main|Principles of Political Economy|John Stuart Mill}}
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|left|100px|John Stuart Mill (1806<U+2013>1873), weaned on the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, wrote the most authoritative economics text of his time.]]

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806<U+2013>1873) was the dominant figure of political economic thought of his time, as well as being a [[Member of Parliament]] for the seat of [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]], and a leading political philosopher. Mill was a child prodigy, reading Ancient Greek from the age of 3, and being vigorously schooled by his father [[James Mill]].<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/milljs.htm John Stuart Mill: Overview], The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref> [[Jeremy Bentham]] was a close mentor and family friend, and Mill was heavily influenced by [[David Ricardo]]. Mill's textbook, first published in 1848 and titled ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' was essentially a summary of the economic wisdom of the mid nineteenth century.<ref>Pressman (2006) p. 44</ref>

''Principles of Political Economy'' (1848) was used as the standard texts by most universities well into the beginning of the twentieth century. On the question of [[economic growth]] Mill tried to find a middle ground between Adam Smith's view of ever expanding opportunities for trade and technological innovation and Thomas Malthus' view of the inherent limits of population. In his fourth book Mill set out a number of possible future outcomes, rather than predicting one in particular. The first followed the Malthusian line that population grew quicker than supplies, leading to falling wages and rising profits.<ref>[http://articlescache.org/homepage.newschool.edu/mill.htm John Stuart Mill, 1806<U+2013>1873], The History of Economic Thought: "Happily, there is nothing in the laws of Value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up; the theory of the subject is complete: the only difficulty to be overcome is that of so stating it as to solve by anticipation the chief perplexities which occur in applying it." (Mill's quote)</ref>

The second, per Smith, said if capital accumulated faster than population grew then [[real wage]]s would rise. Third, echoing [[David Ricardo]], should capital accumulate and population increase at the same rate, yet technology stay stable, there would be no change in real wages because supply and demand for labour would be the same. However growing populations would require more land use, increasing food production costs and therefore decreasing profits. The fourth alternative was that technology advanced faster than population and capital stock increased.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedy of Philosophy <U+2013> [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/ John Stuart Mill] section ''Political Economy''</ref>

The result would be a prospering economy. Mill felt the third scenario most likely, and he assumed technology advanced would have to end at some point.<ref>Pressman (2006) p. 45</ref> But on the prospect of continuing economic growth, Mill was more ambivalent.

{{quote|"I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels, which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of human kind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress."<ref>Mill (1871) Book 4, Chapter 6</ref>}}

Mill is also credited with being the first person to speak of supply and demand as a relationship rather than mere quantities of goods on markets,<ref>Stigler (1965) pp. 1<U+2013>15</ref> the concept of [[opportunity cost]] and the rejection of the [[Wage-fund doctrine|wage fund doctrine]].<ref>Pressman (2006) p.46</ref>

===Frederic Bastiat===
{{Main|Frederic Bastiat}}

[[File:Bastiat.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Frederic Bastiat (1801<U+2013>50)]]

[[Frederic Bastiat]] (1801<U+2013>1850) was a French political economist who in his short career produced many brilliant broadsides against statism, arguing that the only just purpose of government is to protect peoples' life, liberty, and property, not to engage in "legalized plunder".  His 1850 essay "That Which is Seen and That Which is Unseen"<ref>[http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html Bastiat.org]</ref> contains the famous Parable of the Broken Window.  His works later inspired the Austrian School of Economics.

==Capitalism, Communism, and Karl Marx==
{{Main|Marxian economics|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Marx old.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Karl Marx (1818<U+2013>83) published a fundamental critique of classical economics based on the [[labor theory of value]].]]
[[File:Hegel.jpg|right|thumb|100px|George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831)]]

Just as the term "Mercantilism" had been coined and popularized by its critics like [[Adam Smith]], so was the term "Capitalism" or ''Kapitalismus'' used by its critics, primarily [[Karl Marx]] (1818<U+2013>1883), who was, and in many ways still remains the preeminent [[Marxian economics|Socialist economist]]. The [[Socialist]] movement that Marx joined had emerged in response to the miserable conditions of the working class in the new industrial era, and the classical economics which it was based on. The combination of economic-political theory published in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) and ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867) with the [[Dialectical materialism|dialectic theory of history]] inspired by [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770-1831) provided a revolutionary critique of nineteenth-century capitalism.

===Friedrich Engels===
[[File:Engels 1856.jpg|thumb|right|100px|With Marx, Friedrich Engels (1820<U+2013>95) co-authored [[The Communist Manifesto]] and the second volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]''.]]

In 1845 German radical [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820<U+2013>1895) published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'',<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klassen von England in 1844'']</ref> describing workers in Manchester as "the most unconcealed pinnacle of social misery in our day." After Marx died, Engels completed the second volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' from his notes.

===''Das Kapital''===
{{Main|Das Kapital|Capital, Volume I|Karl Marx}}
[[File:Kapital titel bd1.png|thumb|120px|The title page of the first edition of ''Das Kapital'' (1867) in [[German language|German]].]]

Marx wrote his magnum opus ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867) at the [[British Museum]]'s library in London. Karl Marx begins it with the concept of commodities. Before capitalist societies, says Marx, the mode of production was based on [[slavery]] (e.g. in [[ancient Rome]]) before moving to [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[serfdom]] (e.g. in [[medieval Europe]]). As society has advanced, economic bondage has become looser, but the current nexus of labor exchange has produced an equally erratic and unstable situation allowing the conditions for [[revolution]].  People buy and sell their labor in the same way as people buy and sell goods and services.  People themselves are disposable [[commodities]].
As he wrote in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'',

{{quote|"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones."}}

From the first page of ''Das Kapital'':

{{quote|"The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as an immense accumulation of commodities,its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity."<ref>Marx (1859) ''Zur Kritik der Politischen Oekonomie'', Berlin, p. 3.</ref>}}

Marx's use of the word "commodity" is tied to an extensive [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussion of the nature of material wealth, how the objects of wealth are perceived and how they can be used. The concept of a commodity contrasts to objects of the natural world. When people mix their labor with an object it becomes a "commodity". In the natural world there are trees, [[diamond]]s, [[iron ore]] and people. In the economic world they become chairs, [[Ring (finger)|rings]], [[factory|factories]] and workers. However, says Marx, commodities have a dual nature, a dual value. He distinguishes the [[use value]] of a thing from its [[exchange value]], which can be entirely different.<ref>In Marx's words, "the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterized by a total abstraction from use value."</ref> The use value of a thing derives from the amount of labor used to produce it, says Marx, following the classical economists in the [[labor theory of value]]. However, Marx did not believe labor only was the source of use value in things. He believed value can derive too from natural goods and refined his definition of use value to "[[socially necessary labor time]]" (the time people need to produce things when they are not lazy or inefficient).<ref>Marx (1867) Volume I, Part I, Chapter 1, para 14. In Marx's words, "The labor time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time."</ref> Furthermore, people subjectively inflate the value of things, for instance because there's a [[Commodity-fetishism|commodity fetish]] for glimmering diamonds,<ref>Marx (1867) Volume I, Part I, Chapter 1, Section 4, para 123</ref> and oppressive power relations involved in commodity production. These two factors mean exchange values differ greatly. An oppressive power relation, says Marx applying the use/exchange distinction to labor itself, in work-wage bargains derives from the fact that employers pay their workers less in "exchange value" than the workers produce in "use value". The difference makes up the capitalist's [[Profit (economics)|profit]], or in Marx's terminology, "[[surplus value]]".<ref>Marx (1867) Volume I, Part III, Chapter 9, Section 1</ref> Therefore, says Marx, capitalism is a system of [[exploitation]].

[[File:Panic of 1873 bank run.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Marx explained the [[Boom and bust|booms and busts]], like the [[Panic of 1873]], as part of an inherent instability in capitalist economies.]]

Marx's work turned the [[labor theory of value]], as the classicists called it, on its head. His dark irony goes deeper by asking what is the socially necessary labor time for the production of labor (i.e. working people) itself. Marx answers that this is the bare minimum for people to subsist and to reproduce with skills necessary in the economy.<ref>Marx (1867) Volume I, Part II, Chapter VI, para 10. In Marx's words: "Therefore the labor-time requisite for the production of labor-power reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those means of subsistence; in other words, the value of labor-power is the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the laborer."</ref>

People are therefore [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from both the fruits of production and the means to realize their potential, psychologically, by their oppressed position in the labor market. But the tale told alongside exploitation and alienation is one of [[capital accumulation]] and [[economic growth]]. Employers are constantly under pressure from market competition to drive their workers harder, and at the limits invest in labor displacing technology (e.g. an assembly line packer for a robot). This raises profits and expands growth, but for the sole benefit of those who have private property in these [[means of production]]. The working classes meanwhile face progressive immiseration, having had the product of their labor exploited from them, having been alienated from the tools of production. And having been fired from their jobs for machines, they end unemployed. Marx believed that a [[reserve army of the unemployed]] would grow and grow, fueling a downward pressure on wages as desperate people accept work for less. But this would produce a deficit of [[demand]] as the people's [[Purchasing power|power to purchase]] products lagged. There would be a glut in unsold products, production would be cut back, profits decline until capital accumulation halts in an [[economic depression]]. When the glut clears, the economy again starts to boom before the next cyclical bust begins. With every [[boom and bust]], with every capitalist crisis, thought Marx, tension and [[Class conflict|conflict]] between the increasingly polarized classes of capitalists and workers heightens. Moreover smaller firms are being gobbled by larger ones in every business cycle, as power is concentrated in the hands of the few and away from the many. Ultimately, led by the [[Communist party]], Marx envisaged a revolution and the creation of a classless society. How this may work, Marx never suggested. His primary contribution was not in a blue print for how society would be, but a criticism of what he saw it was.

The first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was the only one Marx alone published. The second and third volumes were produced with the help of [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Karl Kautsky]], who had become a friend of Engels, saw through the publication of volume four.

Marx began a tradition of economists who became political activists, including [[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871<U+2013>1919), a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] who later turned towards the [[Communist Party of Germany]] because of their stance against the First World War, and [[Beatrice Webb]] (1858<U+2013>1943) of England, a socialist who helped found both the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) and the [[Fabian Society]].

In the early 19th century German-born English astronomer Sir [[William Herschel]] (1738-1822) noted a connection between 11-year [[Solar cycle|sunspot cycles]] and wheat prices. In 1860 French economist [[Clement Juglar|Cl<U+00E9>ment Juglar]] (1819-1905) proposed the existence of 7-11-year [[Business cycle|Business (Economic) Cycles]].  In 1925 Russian (Soviet) economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]] (1892-1938) proposed the existence of 50-60-year [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev Waves]] in Western capitalist economies.

==Neoclassical Economic Thought: The Marginalist School, the Cambridge School, and the Austrian School==
{{Main|Neoclassical economics|Marginalism|Mathematical economics}}
{{See also|L<U+00E9>on Walras|Alexander del Mar|John Bates Clark|Irving Fisher|William Ashley (economic historian)|Enrico Barone}}

In the 1870s the [[Neoclassical economics]] revolution took place in economics. The new ideas were that of the [[Marginalist]] school. Writing simultaneously and independently, a Frenchman ([[L<U+00E9>on Walras]]), an Austrian ([[Carl Menger]]), and an Englishman ([[Stanley Jevons]]) launched the revolution. Instead of the price of a good or service reflecting the labor that has produced it, it reflects the marginal usefulness (utility) of the last purchase. This meant that in equilibrium, people's preferences determined prices, including, indirectly, the price of labor.

This current of thought was not united, and there were three main independent schools. The [[Neoclassical economics|Cambridge School]] was founded with the 1871 publication of Jevons' ''Theory of Political Economy'', developing theories of partial equilibrium and focusing on market failures. The main representatives were [[Stanley Jevons]], [[Alfred Marshall]], and [[Arthur Pigou]]. The [[Austrian school|Austrian School of Economics]] was made up of Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen von B<U+00F6>hm-Bawerk]], and [[Friedrich von Wieser]], who developed the theory of capital and tried to explain the presence of economic crises. It was founded with the 1871 publication of Menger's ''Principles of Economics''. The [[Lausanne school|Lausanne School]], led by [[L<U+00E9>on Walras]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]] developed the theories of [[general equilibrium]] and [[Pareto efficiency]]. It was founded with the 1874 publication of Walras' ''Elements of Pure Economics''.

===Hermann Heinrich Gossen, Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons, Leon Walras, John Bates Clark, and Marginal Utility===
{{Main|Marginal utility|Carl Menger|Stanley Jevons|L<U+00E9>on Walras|John Bates Clark}}

[[File:CarlMenger.png|thumb|right|100px|Carl Menger (1840<U+2013>1921)]]

In 1854 German economist [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810-1858) published ''Entwickelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs, und der daraus flie<U+00DF>enden Regeln f<U+00FC>r menschliches Handeln'' (The Development of the Laws of Human Intercourse and the Consequent Rules of Human Action), 
which proposed [[Gossen's laws|Gossen's Laws]], the first statement of the principles of [[marginal utility]]. Unfortunately, the German Historical School gave it an icy reception, and it had little impact.

In 1871 Austrian School economist [[Carl Menger]] (1840<U+2013>1921) restated the basic principles of [[marginal utility]] in ''Grunds<U+00E4>tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''<ref>Menger, Carl (1871) ''Grunds<U+00E4>tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'',[http://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp full text in html]</ref> (''[[Principles of Economics]]''): Consumers act rationally by seeking to maximize satisfaction of all their preferences; people allocate their spending so that the last unit of a commodity bought creates no more satisfaction than a last unit bought of something else.

[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|left|100px|William Stanley Jevons (1835<U+2013>82) helped popularize [[marginal utility]] theory.]]

In 1871 Menger's English counterpart [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]] (1835<U+2013>1882) independently published ''Theory of Political Economy'' (1871), stating that at the margin the satisfaction of goods and services decreases. An example of the [[Diminishing returns|Theory of Diminishing Returns]] is that for every orange one eats, the less pleasure one gets from the last orange until one stops eating oranges completely.

[[File:Lwalras.jpg|thumb|right|100px|L<U+00E9>on Walras (1834<U+2013>1910)]]

In 1874 again working independently, French economist [[L<U+00E9>on Walras]] (1834<U+2013>1910) generalized marginal theory across the economy in ''Elements of Pure Economics'': Small changes in people's preferences, for instance shifting from beef to mushrooms, would lead to a mushroom price rise, and beef price fall; his stimulates producers to shift production, increasing mushrooming investment, which would increase market supply and a new price equilibrium between the products, e.g. lowering the price of mushrooms to a level between the two first levels. For many products across the economy the same would happen if one assumes markets are competitive, people choose on the basis of self-interest, and there's no cost for shifting production.

Early attempts to explain away the periodic crises of which Marx had spoken were not initially as successful. After finding a statistical correlation of [[sunspot]]s and business fluctuations and following the common belief at the time that sunspots had a direct effect on weather and hence agricultural output, Stanley Jevons wrote:

{{quote|"When we know that there is a cause, the variation of the solar activity, which is just of the nature to affect the produce of agriculture, and which does vary in the same period, it becomes almost certain that the two series of phenomena <U+2013>  credit cycles and solar variations <U+2013> are connected as effect and cause."<ref>Jevons (1878) p. 334</ref>}}

[[File:John Bates Clark.jpg|thumb|left|100px|John Bates Clark (1847-1938)]]

American economist [[John Bates Clark]] (1847-1938) promoted the marginalist revolution, publishing ''The Distribution of Wealth'' (1899), which proposed Clark's Law of Capitalism: "Given competition and homogeneous factors of production labor and capital, the repartition of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last physical input of units of labor and capital", also expressed as "What a social class gets is, under natural law, what it contributes to the general output of industry."  In 1947 the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] was established in his honor.

In 1838 French mathematician [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] (1801-1877) published ''Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth'', which introduced functions and probability into economics, deriving the first equation for supply and demand as a function of price and publishing the first supply-demand curves, founding modern economic analysis. In it he proposed the [[Cournot duopoly|Cournot Duopoly Model of Competition]], where firms decide the amount of output they will produce. In 1883 French mathematician [[Joseph Louis Francois Bertrand]] (1822-1900) reworked it using prices instead of quantities, proposing the [[Bertrand competition|Bertrand Model of Competition]].

[[File:Edgeworth.jpeg|thumb|left|100px|Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (1845-1926)]]

In 1881 Irish economist [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] (1845-1926) published ''Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences'', which introduced indifference curves and the generalized utility function, along with [[Edgeworth's limit theorem|Edgeworth's Limit Theorem]], extending the Bertrand Model to handle capacity constraints, and proposing [[Edgeworth paradox|Edgeworth's Paradox]] for when there is no limit to what the firms can sell.

[[File:Vilfredo Pareto.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Vilfredo Pareto (1848<U+2013>1923)]]

Italian economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848<U+2013>1923) was best known for developing the concept of an economy that would permit maximizing the utility level of each individual given the feasible utility level of others from production and exchange.  Such a result came to be called [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto Efficiency]].  Pareto devised mathematical representations for such a resource allocation, notable in abstracting from institutional arrangements and monetary measures of [[Economic wealth|wealth]] or [[distribution of income|income]] [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]].<ref><U+2022> Alan Kirman (2008).

[[File:Alfred Marshall.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Alfred Marshall (1842<U+2013>1924) wrote the main alternative textbook to John Stuart Mill of the day, ''Principles of Economics'' (1890)]]

[[Alfred Marshall]] (1842<U+2013>1924) is also credited with an attempt to put economics on a more mathematical footing.  The first professor of economics at the [[University of Cambridge]], his 1890 work ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html ''Principles of Economics''], by Alfred Marshall, at the Library of Economics and Liberty</ref> abandoned the term "[[political economy]]" for his favorite "[[economics]]". He viewed math as a way to simplify economic reasoning, although he had reservations as revealed in a letter to his student [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]]:

{{quote|"(1) Use mathematics as shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. (2) Keep to them till you have done. (3) Translate into English. (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. (5) Burn the mathematics. (6) If you can't succeed in 4, burn 3. This I do often."<ref>Buchholz (1989) p. 151</ref>}}

Coming after the marginal revolution, Marshall concentrated on reconciling the classical labor theory of value which had concentrated on the supply side of the market with the new marginalist theory that concentrated on the consumer demand side.  Marshall's graphical representation is the famous [[supply and demand|Supply and Demand Graph]], a.k.a. the Marshallian Cross, which treats the intersection of the supply and demand curves as the equilibrium of price in a competitive market. Over the long run, he argued, the costs of production and the price of goods and services tend towards the lowest point consistent with continued production.

[[File:LouisBachelier.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Louis Bachelier (1870-1946)]]

In 1900 French mathematician [[Louis Bachelier]] (1870-1946) published his dissertation ''The Theory of Speculation'', pioneering the study of [[Brownian Motion]] and stochastic processes and applying it to random walks of market prices, nearly coming up with the [[Black-Scholes|Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model]].

American statistician [[Harold Hotelling]] (1895-1973) was a major figure in the application of statistics to economics. In 1929 he proposed [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling's Law]], that in many markets it is rational for producers to make their products as similar as possible. In 1931 he proposed [[Hotelling's rule|Hotelling's Rule]], that the most socially and economically profitable extraction path of a non-renewable resource is one along which the price of the resource, determined by the marginal net revenue from the sale of the resource, increases at the rate of interest. In 1932 he proposed [[Hotelling's lemma|Hotelling's Lemma]], that a firm's net supply function is the partial derivative of the profit function with respect to the price. In 1938 he pioneered the study of [[non-convexity in economics]].

[[File:Paul Pierre Levy 1886-1971.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Paul Pierre L<U+00E9>vy (1886-1971)]]

In 1939 French mathematician [[Paul L<U+00E9>vy (mathematician)|Paul Pierre L<U+00E9>vy]] (1886-1971) introduced the concept of [[Martingale (probability theory)|Martingales]] into probability theory, where the expectation of the next value in a sequence is the present observed value, modeling fair games, getting widely adopted by economists.

==The Austrian School of Economics==

[[File:1wieser.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Friedrich von Wieser (1851<U+2013>1926)]]

While economics at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth was dominated increasingly by mathematical analysis, the followers of [[Carl Menger]] (1840-1921) and his disciples [[Eugen von B<U+00F6>hm-Bawerk]] (1851<U+2013>1914) and [[Friedrich von Wieser]] (1851<U+2013>1926) (coiner of the term "marginal utility") followed a different route, advocating the use of deductive logic instead.  This group became known as the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]], reflecting the Austrian origin of many of the early adherents. [[Thorstein Veblen]] in ''The Preconceptions of Economic Science'' (1900) contrasted neoclassical [[marginalism|marginalists]] in the tradition of [[Alfred Marshall]] with the philosophies of the Austrian School.<ref>Veblen, Thorstein Bunde; "The Preconceptions of Economic Science" Pt III, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' v14 (1900).</ref><ref name="Colander" >Colander, David; ''The Death of Neoclassical Economics''.</ref>  Unfortunately in 1883 Menger began the bitter [[Methodenstreit]] ("strife over method") with the German historical school, which the latter won by 1900, getting Austrian School economists excluded from academic positions in Germany, which caused German economic thought to fall behind the rest of the West until the historical school was superseded in the 1930s by the more open [[Freiburg school|Freiburg School]].

===Joseph Alois Schumpeter===
[[File:Joseph Schumpeter ekonomialaria.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883<U+2013>1950)]]

[[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] (1883<U+2013>1950) was an Austrian School economist and political scientist best known for his works on [[business cycles]] and [[innovation]].  He insisted on the role of the entrepreneurs in an economy.  In ''Business Cycles: A theoretical, historical and statistical analysis of the Capitalist process'' (1939), Schumpeter synthesized the theories about business cycles, suggesting that they could explain the economic situations. According to Schumpeter, capitalism necessarily goes through long-term cycles because it is entirely based upon scientific inventions and innovations.  A phase of expansion is made possible by innovations, because they bring [[productivity|productivity gains]] and encourage entrepreneurs to invest.  However, when investors have no more opportunities to invest, the economy goes into recession, several firms collapse, closures and bankruptcy occur.  This phase lasts until new innovations bring a [[creative destruction]] process, i.e. they destroy old products, reduce the employment, but they allow the economy to start a new phase of growth, based upon new products and new [[factors of production]].<ref>Alessandro Roncaglia.

===Ludwig von Mises===
[[File:Ludwig von Mises.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Ludwig von Mises (1881<U+2013>1973)]]

[[Ludwig von Mises]] (1881<U+2013>1973) was a central figure in the Austrian School. In his 1949 magnum opus on economics, ''[[Human Action]]'', Mises introduced [[Praxeology]], "the science of human action", as a more general conceptual foundation of the social sciences . Praxeology views economics as a series of voluntary trades that increase the satisfaction of the involved parties. In 1920 Mises argued that socialism suffers from an unsolvable [[economic calculation problem]], which according to him could only be solved through [[free market]] [[price mechanism]]s, launching the [[Economic calculation debate]] with socialist economists.

===Friedrich Hayek===
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Friedrich Hayek (1899<U+2013>1992)]]

Mises' outspoken [[criticisms of socialism]] had a large influence on the economic thinking of Austrian School economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] (1899<U+2013>1992), who, while initially sympathetic, became one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.<ref name="urlBiography of F. A. Hayek (1899<U+2013>1992)">{{cite web |url=http://mises.org/about/3234 |title=Biography of F. A.

In his book, ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) and in subsequent works, Hayek claimed that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn would lead towards [[totalitarianism]]. Hayek attributed the birth of civilization to [[private property]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]'' (1988). According to him, [[price signals]] are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate [[tacit knowledge]] or [[dispersed knowledge]] to each other, to solve the [[economic calculation problem]]. Along with his Socialist Swedish contemporary and opponent [[Gunnar Myrdal]] (1898<U+2013>1987), Hayek was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974.

In 1895 German economist [[Georg Friedrich Knapp]] (1842-1926) published ''The State Theory of Money'', which founded the [[Chartalist]] school of monetary theory, which opposes [[metallism]] and argues that money has no intrinsic value but is only a "creature of law", i.e., fiat money, with its value established by taxation.

{{Main|Thorstein Veblen}}

[[File:Veblen3a.jpg|upright|thumb|left|100px|Thorstein Veblen (1857<U+2013>1929)]]

[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857<U+2013>1929), who came from rural midwestern America and worked at the [[University of Chicago]] is one of the best-known early critics of the "American Way". In ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' (1899) he scorned [[Materialism|materialistic]] culture and wealthy people who [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] their riches as a way of demonstrating success. In ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]'' (1904) Veblen distinguished production for people to use things and production for pure profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism of [[consumerism]] and [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]] did not advocate change. However, in 1918 he moved to New York to begin work as an editor of a magazine called ''[[The Dial]]'', and then in 1919, along with [[Charles A. Beard]], [[James Harvey Robinson]], and [[John Dewey]] he helped found the New School for Social Research, known today as [[The New School]]) He was also part of the [[Technical Alliance]],<ref>Stabile, Donald R. "Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time", ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43<U+2013>44.</ref> created in 1919 by [[Howard Scott]]. From 1919 through 1926 Veblen continued to write and to be involved in various activities at The New School. During this period he wrote ''The Engineers and the Price System (1921).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/%7Eecon/ugcm/3ll3/veblen/Engineers.pdf |title=The Engineers and the Price System |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>

==World War I and the Great Depression: Consequences to Economic Thought==

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] (August 1, 1914 <U+2013> November 11, 1918), [[Alfred Marshall]] was still working on his last revisions of his ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. The 20th century's initial climate of optimism was soon violently dismembered in the trenches of the Western Front as the civilized world tore itself apart. For four years the production of Britain, Germany, and France were geared entirely towards the industry of death.  In 1917 Russia crumbled into revolution led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[Bolshevik Party]], who touted Marxist theory as the savior, and promised a broken country "peace, bread and land" by collectivizing the means of production.  Also in 1917 the United States of America entered the war on the side of the Allies (France and Britain), with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] claiming to be "making the world safe for democracy", devising a peace plan of [[Fourteen Points]].  In 1918 Germany launched a spring offensive which failed, and as the allies counterattacked and more millions were slaughtered, Germany slid into the [[German Revolution]], its interim government suing for peace on the basis of Wilson's Fourteen Points.  After the war, Europe lay in ruins, financially, physically, psychologically, and its future was dependent on the dictates of the [[Versailles conference|Versailles Conference]] in 1919.

==Economic Thought Between the World Wars==
After World War I, Europe and the Soviet Union lay in ruins, and the [[British Empire]] was nearing its end, leaving the United States as the preeminent global economic power.
Before World War II, American economists had played a minor role. During this time [[institutional economists]] had been largely critical of the "American Way" of life, especially the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the [[Roaring Twenties]] before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. After the crash a more orthodox body of thought took root, reacting against the lucid debating style of Keynes, and remathematizing the profession. The orthodox center was also challenged by a more radical group of scholars based at the University of Chicago, who advocated "liberty" and "freedom", looking back to 19th century-style non-interventionist governments.

In 1919 Yale economist [[Walton H. Hamilton]] coined the term "[[Institutional economics]]". 
In 1934 [[John R. Commons]] (1862<U+2013>1945), another economist from midwestern America published ''Institutional Economics'' (1934), based on the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests, including monopolies, large corporations, labor disputes, and fluctuating business cycles.  They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes.  Government, thought Commons, ought to be the mediator between the conflicting groups.  Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.

{{Main|Arthur Cecil Pigou}}

[[File:A.C. Pigou.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Arthur Cecil Pigou]] (1877<U+2013>1959)]]

In 1920 Alfred Marshall's student [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]] (1877<U+2013>1959) published ''[[Wealth and Welfare]]'', which insisted on the possibility of [[market failure]]s, claiming that markets are inefficient in the case of [[externality|economic externalities]], and the state must interfere to prevent them. However, Pigou retained free market beliefs, and in 1933, in the face of the economic crisis, he explained in ''[[The Theory of Unemployment]]'' that the excessive intervention of the state in the labor market was the real cause of massive [[unemployment]] because the governments had established a minimal wage, which prevented wages from adjusting automatically.  This was to be the focus of attack from Keynes.  In 1943 Pigou published the paper ''The Classical Stationary State'', which popularized the [[Pigou effect|Pigou (Real Balance) Effect]], the stimulation of output and employment during deflation by increasing consumption due to a rise in wealth

==John Maynard Keynes and Keynesianism==
{{Main|John Maynard Keynes|The Economic Consequences of the Peace}}

[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|left|thumb|120px|John Maynard Keynes (1883<U+2013>1946) (right) with his American counterpart [[Harry Dexter White|Harry White]] at the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]].]]

[[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883<U+2013>1946) was born in Cambridge, educated at [[Eton college|Eton]], and supervised by both [[A. C. Pigou]] and [[Alfred Marshall]] at [[Cambridge University]]. He began his career as a lecturer before working for the British government during the Great War, rising to be the British government's financial representative at the [[Versailles conference|Versailles Conference]], where he profoundly disagreed with the decisions made.  His observations were laid out in his book ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''<ref>Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP.html ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''] at The Library of Economics and Liberty</ref> (1919), where he documented his outrage at the collapse of American adherence to the [[Fourteen Points]]<ref>Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP3.html#Chapter%203 Chapter III], para 20</ref> and the mood of vindictiveness that prevailed towards Germany.,<ref>Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP.html Chapter V], para 43</ref> and he resigned from the conference, using extensive economic data provided by the conference records to argue that if the victors forced [[war reparations]] to be paid by the defeated Axis, then a world financial crisis would ensue, leading to a second world war.<ref>Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP6.html#Chapter%206 Chapter VI], para 4</ref>  Keynes finished his treatise by advocating, first, a reduction in reparation payments by Germany to a realistically manageable level, increased intra-governmental management of continental coal production and a free trade union through the [[League of Nations]];<ref>Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP7.html#Chapter%207 Chapter VII], para 7</ref> second, an arrangement to set off debt repayments between the Allied countries;<ref>Keynes (1919) Chapter VII, para 30</ref> third, complete reform of international currency exchange and an international loan fund;<ref>Keynes (1919) Chapter VII, para 48</ref> and fourth, a reconciliation of trade relations with Russia and Eastern Europe.<ref>Keynes (1919) Chapter VII, para 58</ref>

The book was an enormous success, and though it was criticized for false predictions by a number of people,<ref>e.g. Etienne Mantioux (1946) ''The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes''</ref> without the changes he advocated, Keynes's dark forecasts matched the world's experience through the [[Great Depression]] which began in 1929, and the descent into [[World War II]] in 1939.  World War I had been touted as the "war to end all wars", and the absolute failure of the peace settlement generated an even greater determination to not repeat the same mistakes.  With the defeat of [[Fascism]], the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] was held in July 1944 to establish a new economic order, in which Keynes was again to play a leading role.

===''The General Theory''===
{{Main|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}

During the Great Depression, Keynes published his most important work, ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' (1936). The Great Depression had been sparked by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], leading to massive rises in unemployment in the United States, leading to debts being recalled from European borrowers, and an economic domino effect across the world. Orthodox economics called for a tightening of spending, until business confidence and profit levels could be restored. Keynes by contrast, had argued in ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' (1923) (which argues for a stable currency) that a variety of factors determined economic activity, and that it was not enough to wait for the long run market equilibrium to restore itself. As Keynes famously remarked:

{{quote|"...this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again."<ref>Keynes (1923) Chapter 3</ref>}}

On top of the [[Money supply|supply of money]], Keynes identified the [[propensity to consume]], inducement to invest, marginal efficiency of capital, liquidity preference, and multiplier effect as variables which determine the level of the economy's output, employment, and price levels. Much of this esoteric terminology was invented by Keynes especially for his ''General Theory''. Keynes argued that if [[savings]] were being withheld from [[investment]] in [[financial market]]s, total spending falls, leading to reduced incomes and unemployment, which reduces savings again. This continues until the desire to save becomes equal to the desire to invest, which means a new "equilibrium" is reached and the spending decline halts. This new "equilibrium" is a depression, where people are investing less, have less to save and less to spend.

Keynes argued that employment depends on total spending, which is composed of consumer spending and business investment in the [[private sector]]. Consumers only spend "passively", or according to their income fluctuations. Businesses, on the other hand, are induced to invest by the expected rate of return on new investments (the benefit) and the rate of interest paid (the cost). So, said Keynes, if business expectations remained the same, and government reduces interest rates (the costs of borrowing), investment would increase, and would have a multiplied effect on total spending. [[Interest rate]]s, in turn, depend on the quantity of money and the desire to hold money in bank accounts (as opposed to investing). If not enough money is available to match how much people want to hold, interest rates rise until enough people are put off. So if the quantity of money were increased, while the desire to hold money remained stable, interest rates would fall, leading to increased investment, output and employment. For both these reasons, Keynes therefore advocated low interest rates and easy credit, to combat unemployment.

But Keynes believed in the 1930s, conditions necessitated public sector action. [[Deficit spending]], said Keynes, would kick-start economic activity. This he had advocated in an open letter to U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' (1933). The [[New Deal]] programme in the U.S. had been well underway by the publication of the ''General Theory''. It provided conceptual reinforcement for policies already pursued. Keynes also believed in a more egalitarian distribution of income, and taxation on [[unearned income]] arguing that high rates of savings (to which richer folk are prone) are not desirable in a developed economy. Keynes therefore advocated both monetary management and an active fiscal policy.

During World War II Keynes acted as adviser to [[HM Treasury]] again, negotiating major loans from the U.S., helping formulate the plans for the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[International Trade Organisation]]<ref>This was not accepted by the United States Congress at the time, but arose later through the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] of 1947 and the [[World Trade Organisation]] of 1994</ref> at the 1944 [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods Conference]], a package designed to stabilize world economy fluctuations that had occurred in the 1920s and create a level trading field across the globe.  Keynes passed away little more than a year later, but his ideas had already shaped a new global economic order, and all Western governments followed the [[Keynesian economics]] program of deficit spending to avert crises and maintain full employment.

One of Keynes's pupils at Cambridge was [[Joan Robinson]] (1903<U+2013>1983), a member of Keynes's [[Cambridge Circus (economics)|Cambridge Circus]], who contributed to the notion that [[competition]] is seldom perfect in a market, an indictment of the theory of markets setting prices. In ''The Production Function and the Theory of Capital'' (1953) Robinson tackled what she saw to be some of the circularity in orthodox economics. Neoclassicists assert that a competitive market forces producers to minimize the costs of production. Robinson said that costs of production are merely the prices of inputs, like [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Capital goods get their value from the final products.  And if the price of the final products determines the price of capital, then it is, argued Robinson, utterly circular to say that the price of capital determines the price of the final products. Goods cannot be priced until the costs of inputs are determined. This would not matter if everything in the economy happened instantaneously, but in the real world, price setting takes time <U+2013> goods are priced before they are sold. Since capital cannot be adequately valued in independently measurable units, how can one show that capital earns a return equal to the contribution to production?

[[Richard Kahn, Baron Kahn|Richard Kahn]] (1905-1989) was a member of the Cambridge Circus who in 1931 proposed the [[Multiplier (economics)|Multiplier]].

[[File:Sraffa.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Piero Sraffa (1898<U+2013>1983).]]

[[Piero Sraffa]] (1898<U+2013>1983) came to England from [[Italian Empire|Fascist Italy]] in the 1920s, and became a member of the Cambridge Circus.  In 1960 he published a small book called ''Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities'', which explained how technological relationships are the basis for production of goods and services. Prices result from wage-profit tradeoffs, collective bargaining, labour and management conflict and the intervention of government planning. Like Robinson, Sraffa was showing how the major force for price setting in the economy was not necessarily market adjustments.

[[John Hicks]] (1904-1989) of England was a Keynesian who in 1937 proposed the [[IS/LM model|Investment Saving - Liquidity Preference Money Supply Model]], which treats the intersection of the IS and LM curves as the general equilibrium in both markets.

In response to the [[Economic calculation problem|Economic Calculation Problem]] proposed by the Austrian School of Economics that disputes the efficiency of a state-run economy, the theory of [[Market socialism|Market Socialism]] was developed in the late 1920s and 1930s by economists [[Fred M. Taylor]] (1855-1932), [[Oskar R. Lange]] (1904-1965), [[Abba Lerner]] (1903<U+2013>82) et al., combining Marxian economics with neoclassical economics after dumping the labor theory of value. In 1938 [[Abram Bergson]] (1914-2003) defined the [[Social welfare function|Social Welfare Function]].

In the 1930s the [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm School of Economics]] was founded by [[Eli Heckscher]] (1879-1952), [[Bertil Ohlin]] (1899-1977), [[Gunnar Myrdal]] (1898<U+2013>1987) et al. based on the works of [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Knut Wicksell]] (1851-1926), advising the founders of the Swedish Socialist welfare state.

In 1933 Olin and Heckscher proposed the [[Heckscher-ohlin model|Heckscher-Ohlin Model of International Trade]], which claims that countries will export products that use their abundant and cheap factors of production and import products that use their scarce factors of production. In 1977 Ohlin was awarded a share of the Nobel Economics Prize.

In 1957 Myrdal published his theory of [[Circular Cumulative Causation]], in which a change in one institution ripples through others.  In 1974 he received a share of the Nobel Economics Prize.

In 1936 Russian-American economist [[Wassily Leontief]] (1905<U+2013>1999) proposed the [[Input-output analysis|Input-Output Model]] of economics, which uses linear algebra and is ideally suited to computers, receiving the 1973 Nobel Economics Prize.  After World War II, [[Lawrence Klein]] (1920<U+2013>) pioneered the use of computers in econometric modeling, receiving the 1980 Nobel Economics Prize. In 1963<U+2013>4 as [[John Tukey]] of Princeton University was developing the revolutionary [[Fast Fourier Transform]], which greatly speeded up the calculation of Fourier Transforms, his British assistant Sir [[Clive Granger]] (1934<U+2013>2009) pioneered the use of Fourier Transforms in economics, receiving the 2003 Nobel Economics Prize. Ragnar Frisch's assistant [[Trygve Haavelmo]] (1911<U+2013>1999) received the 1989 Nobel Economics Prize for clarifying the probability foundations of econometrics and for analysis of simultaneous economic structures.

==Adolf Berle, Gardiner C. Means and Corporate Governance==

[[File:Adolf Augustus Berle NYWTS.jpg|thumb|100px|Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr. (1895<U+2013>1971) with [[Gardiner Means]] was a foundational figure of modern [[corporate governance]].]]

The [[Great Depression]] was a time of significant upheaval in the world economy. One of the most original contributions to understanding what went wrong came from [[Harvard University]] [[lawyer]] [[Adolf Berle]] (1895<U+2013>1971), who like [[John Maynard Keynes]] had resigned from his diplomatic job at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] and was deeply disillusioned by the [[Versailles Treaty]]. In his book with American economist [[Gardiner C. Means]] (1896-1988) ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932) he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account. [[Board of directors|Directors]] of companies are held to account to the [[shareholder]]s of companies, or not, by the rules found in [[company law]] statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America the typical company laws (e.g. in [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]]) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big [[public company|public companies]] were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered. Berle served in President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s administration through the Great Depression as a key member of his [[Brain trust|Brain Trust]], developing many [[New Deal]] policies.

In 1967 Berle and Means issued a revised edition of their work, in which the preface added a new dimension. It was not only the separation of controllers of companies from the owners as shareholders at stake. They posed the question of what the corporate structure was really meant to achieve:

{{quote|"Stockholders toil not, neither do they spin, to earn [dividends and share price increases]. They are beneficiaries by position only. Justification for their inheritance... can be founded only upon social grounds... that justification turns on the distribution as well as the existence of wealth. Its force exists only in direct ratio to the number of individuals who hold such wealth. Justification for the stockholder's existence thus depends on increasing distribution within the American population. Ideally the stockholder's position will be impregnable only when every American family has its fragment of that position and of the wealth by which the opportunity to develop individuality becomes fully actualized."<ref>Berle (1967) p. xxiii</ref>}}

==Post-World War II Economic Thought: The Globalization Era==
{{Main|Globalization}}

The globalization era began with the end of World War II and the rise of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power, along with the [[United Nations]]. To prevent another global depression, the victorious U.S. forgave Germany its war debts and used its surpluses to rebuild Europe and encourage reindustrialization of Germany and Japan. In the 1960s it changed its role to recycling global surpluses.

After World War II, Canadian-born [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908<U+2013>2006) became one of the standard bearers for pro-active government and liberal-democrat politics. In ''[[The Affluent Society]]'' (1958), Galbraith argued that voters reaching a certain material wealth begin to vote against the common good. He also argued that the "[[conventional wisdom]]" of the conservative consensus was not enough to solve the problems of social inequality.<ref>Galbraith (1958) Chapter 2; n.b. though Galbraith claimed to coin the phrase "conventional wisdom", the phrase is used several times in [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s book ''The Instinct of Workmanship''.</ref> In an age of big business, he argued, it is unrealistic to think of markets of the classical kind. They set prices and use [[advertising]] to create [[artificial demand]] for their own products, distorting people's real preferences. Consumer preferences actually come to reflect those of corporations <U+2013> a "dependence effect" <U+2013> and the economy as a whole is geared to irrational goals.<ref>Galbraith (1958) Chapter 11</ref> In ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' Galbraith argued that economic decisions are planned by a private-bureaucracy, a [[technostructure]] of experts who manipulate [[marketing]] and [[public relations]] channels. This hierarchy is self-serving, profits are no longer the prime motivator, and even managers are not in control. Because they are the new planners, corporations detest risk, require steady economic and stable markets. They recruit governments to serve their interests with fiscal and monetary policy, for instance adhering to monetarist policies which enrich money-lenders in the City through increases in interest rates. While the goals of an affluent society and complicit government serve the irrational technostructure, public space is simultaneously impoverished. Galbraith paints the picture of stepping from penthouse villas onto unpaved streets, from landscaped gardens to unkempt public parks. In ''[[Economics and the Public Purpose]]'' (1973) Galbraith advocates a "new socialism" as the solution, [[Nationalization|nationalising]] military production and public services such as [[health care]], introducing disciplined salary and price controls to reduce inequality.

==Paul Samuelson==
{{Main|Paul Samuelson|Neoclassical synthesis|Positive economics}}
[[File:Paul Samuelson.gif|thumb|left|100px|Paul Samuelson (1915<U+2013>2009) wrote the best selling economics texts.]]

In contrast to Galbraith's linguistic style, the post-war economics profession began to synthesize much of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' work with mathematical representations. Introductory university economics courses began to present economic theory as a unified whole in what is referred to as the [[neoclassical synthesis]]. "[[Positive economics]]" became the term created to describe certain trends and "laws" of economics that could be objectively observed and described in a value-free way, separate from "[[Normative economics|normative economic]]" evaluations and judgments.

The best-selling textbook writer of this generation was [[Paul Samuelson]] (1915<U+2013>2009), a student of Wassily Leontief. His [[Ph.D.]] dissertation was an attempt to show that mathematical methods could [[mathematical problem|represent]] a core of testable economic theory. It was published as ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' in 1947. Samuelson started with two assumptions. First, people and firms will act to [[rational choice theory|maximize]] their self-interested goals. Second, markets tend towards an [[market equilibrium|equilibrium]] of prices, where demand matches supply. He extended the mathematics to describe equilibrating behavior of [[economic system]]s, including that of the then new [[macroeconomic theory]] of [[John Maynard Keynes]]. Whilst [[Richard Cantillon]] had imitated [[Isaac Newton]]'s mechanical physics of inertia and gravity in competition and the market,<ref name="Fusfeld 1994 p.21"/> the [[physiocrats]] had copied the body's blood system into circular flow of income models, [[William Jevons]] had found growth cycles to match the periodicity of [[sunspot]]s, Samuelson adapted [[thermodynamics]] formulae to economic theory. Reasserting economics as a hard science was being done in the United Kingdom also, and one celebrated "discovery", of [[A. W. Phillips]], was of a correlative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The workable policy conclusion was that securing full employment could be traded-off against higher inflation. Samuelson incorporated the idea of the [[Phillips curve]] into his work. His introductory textbook [[Economics (textbook)|''Economics'']] was influential and widely adopted. It became the most successful economics text ever. Paul Samuelson was awarded the new [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1970 for his merging of mathematics and political economy.

==Kenneth Arrow==

American economist [[Kenneth Arrow]] (1921-) is Paul Samuelson's brother-in-law. His first major work, forming his doctoral dissertation at [[Columbia University]] was ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' (1951), which brought economics into contact with political theory. This gave rise to [[social choice theory]] with the introduction of his "[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Possibility Theorem]]". In his words,

{{quote|"If we exclude the possibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility, then the only methods of passing from individual tastes to social preferences which will be satisfactory and which will be defined for a wide range of sets of individual orderings are either imposed or dictatorial."<ref>Kenneth Arrow, "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare" (1950).</ref>}}

This sparked widespread discussion over how to interpret the different conditions of the theorem and what implications it had for democracy and voting. Most controversial of his four (1963) or five (1950/1951) conditions is the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]].

[[File:Debreu, G<U+00E9>rard (1921-2004).jpeg|left|thumb|100px|G<U+00E9>rard Debreu (1921<U+2013>2004)]]

In the 1950s Kenneth Arrow and [[G<U+00E9>rard Debreu]] (1921<U+2013>2004) developed the [[Arrow<U+2013>Debreu model]] of [[General equilibrium|general equilibria]].

In 1963 Arrow published a paper which founded [[Health economics|Health Economics]].

In 1971 Arrow and [[Frank Hahn]] published ''General Competitive Analysis'' (1971), which reasserted a theory of general equilibrium of prices through the economy.  With [[John Hicks]], Arrow won the Nobel Economics Prize in 1972, the youngest recipient to date. The year before, 1971, US President [[Richard Nixon]]'s had declared that "[[We are all Keynesians now]]"<ref>, announcing wage and price controls. He lifted this from a comment by [[Milton Friedman]] in 1965 which formed a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-3,00.html article] title, Friday, Dec. 31, 1965. See below.</ref> The irony was that this was the beginning of a new revolution in economic thought. In 1983 Debreu won the Nobel Economics Prize.

The government-interventionist monetary and fiscal policies that the postwar Keynesian economists recommended came under attack by a group of theorists working at the [[University of Chicago]], which came in the 1950s to be known as the [[Chicago School (economics)|Chicago School of Economics]]. Before World War II, the Old Chicago School of strong Keynesians was founded by [[Frank Knight]] (1885-1972), [[Jacob Viner]] (1892-1970), and 
[[Henry Calvert Simons]] (1899-1946). The second generation was known for a more conservative line of thought, reasserting a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] view of market activity that people are best left to themselves to be free to choose how to conduct their own affairs.

===Ronald Coase, Richard Posner, and Law and Economics===
{{Main|Ronald Coase|Richard Posner|Law and economics}}

[[File:Richard posner harvardz.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Richard Posner (1939-)]]

[[Ronald Coase]] (1910-2013) of the Chicago School of Economics was the most prominent economic analyst of law, and the 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] winner.  His first major article ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937) argued that the reason for the existence of firms ([[company law|companies]], partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s. [[Homo economicus]] trades through bilateral [[contract]]s on open markets until the costs of transactions make the use of corporations to produce things more cost-effective. His second major article ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960) argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of an old [[Law|legal]] case about [[nuisance]] named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweets maker and a quiet doctor were neighbors and went to court to see who should have to move.<ref>''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852</ref> Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweets maker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial [[bargaining|bargain]] about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.<ref>Coase (1960) IV, 7</ref> So the law ought to preempt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.<ref>Coase (1960) V, 9</ref> Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analyzing the costs of action.<ref>Coase (1960) VIII, 23</ref>

In 1973 Coase disciple [[Richard Posner]] (1939-) published ''Economic Analysis of Law'', which became a standard textbook, causing him to become the most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 1981 he published ''The Economics of Justice'', which claimed that judges have been interpreting common law as it they were trying to maximize economic welfare.

===Milton Friedman and Capitalism and Freedom===
{{Main|Milton Friedman}}
[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Milton Friedman (1912<U+2013>2006)]]

[[Milton Friedman]] (1912<U+2013>2006) of the Chicago School of Economics is one of the most influential economists of the late 20th, century, receiving the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976.  He is known for ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'' (1963), in which he argued that the [[Great Depression]] was caused by the policies of the [[Federal Reserve]]. Friedman argues that laissez-faire government policy is more desirable than government intervention in the economy. Governments should aim for a neutral monetary policy oriented toward long-run [[economic growth]], by gradual expansion of the money supply. He advocates the [[quantity theory of money]], that general prices are determined by money. Therefore active monetary (e.g. easy credit) or fiscal (e.g. tax and spend) policy can have unintended negative effects. In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman wrote:

{{quote|"There is likely to be a lag between the need for action and government recognition of the need; a further lag between recognition of the need for action and the taking of action; and a still further lag between the action and its effects."<ref>Friedman (1967) p.</ref>}}

Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function, the [[permanent income hypothesis|Permanent Income Hypothesis]] (1957), which Friedman referred to as his best scientific work.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Charlie Rose Show|airdate=2005-12-26}}</ref> This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to rise later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the [[Phillips curve|Phillips Curve]], and the concept of the [[natural rate of unemployment]] (1968). This critique associated his name with the insight that a government that brings about higher inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections in the labor market.

==Eugene Fama and the Efficient Market Hypothesis==

[[File:20080105 Fama Winning Morgan Stanley Prize.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Eugene Fama (1939-)]]

In 1965 Chicago School economist [[Eugene Fama]] (1939-) published ''The Behavior of Stock Market Prices'', which found that stock market prices follow a random walk, proposing the [[Efficient market hypothesis|Efficient Market Hypothesis]], that randomness is characteristic of a perfectly functioning financial market. The same year [[Paul Samuelson]] published a paper concluding the same thing with a mathematical proof, sharing the credit. Earlier in 1948 [[Holbrook Working]] (1895-1985) published a paper saying the same thing, but not in a mathematical form. In 1970 Fama published ''Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work'', proposing that efficient markets can be strong, semi-strong, or weak, and also proposing the [[Joint hypothesis problem|Joint Hypothesis Problem]], that the idea of market efficiency can't be rejected without also rejecting the market mechanism.

In 1955 he published volume 2 ''Trade and Welfare'', which proposed the theory of the "second-best", and promoted protectionism.  He shared the 1977 Nobel Economic Prize with Bertil Ohlin.

==Sir Arthur Lewis, Simon Kuznets and Development Economics==
{{Main|Sir Arthur Lewis|Simon Kuznets|Development economics}}

In 1954 Saint Lucian economist [[Sir Arthur Lewis]] (1915<U+2013>1991) proposed the [[Dual sector model|Dual Sector Model]] of [[Development economics|Development Economics]], which claims that capitalism expands by making use of an unlimited supply of labor from the backward non-capitalist "subsistence sector" until it reaches the Lewisian breaking point where wages begin to rise, receiving the 1979 Nobel Economics Prize.

In 1955 Russian-born American economist [[Simon Kuznets]] (1901<U+2013>1985) published an article revealing an inverted U-shaped relation between income inequality and economic growth, meaning that economic growth increases income disparity between rich and poor in poor countries, but decreases it in wealthy countries.  In 1971 he received the Nobel Economics Prize.

{{quote|"The fundamental problem with the neoclassical model and the corresponding model under market socialism is that they fail to take into account a variety of problems that arise from the absence of perfect information and the costs of acquiring information, as well as the absence or imperfections in certain key risk and capital markets. The absence or imperfection can, in turn, to a large extent be explained by problems of information."<ref>Stiglitz (1996) p. 5</ref>}}

[[File:Edward C. Prescott.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Edward C. Prescott (1940-)]]

In the early 1970s American Chicago School economist [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]] (1937-) founded [[New Classical economics|New Classical Macroeconomics]] based on [[Milton Friedman]]'s monetarist critique of Keynesian macroeconomics, and the idea of [[rational expectations]],<ref>Mankiw, 1647<U+2013>1648.</ref> first proposed in 1961 by [[John Muth|John F. Muth]], opposing the idea that government intervention can or should stabilize the economy.<ref>Manikw, N. Greg. "A Quick Refresher Course in Macroeconomics." ''Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 28'', No. 4. (Dec., 1990), pp. 1647.</ref> The [[Policy-ineffectiveness proposition|Policy-Ineffectiveness Proposition]] (1975)<ref>Mankiw, 1649.</ref> of [[Thomas J. Sargent]] (1943-) and [[Neil Wallace]] (1939-), which seemed to refute a basic assumption of Keynesian economics was also adopted. The [[Lucas aggregate supply function]] states that economic output is a function of money or price "surprise." Lucas was awarded the 1995 Nobel Economics Prize.

Lucas' model was superseded as the standard model of New Classical Macroeconomics by the [[real business cycle theory|Real Business Cycle Theory]], proposed in 1982 by [[Finn Kydland]] (1943-) and [[Edward C. Prescott]] (1940-), which seeks to explain observed fluctuations in output and employment in terms of real variables such as changes in technology and tastes. Assuming competitive markets, real business cycle theory implies that cyclical fluctuations are optimal responses to variability in technology and tastes, and that macroeconomic stabilization policies must reduce welfare.<ref>Mankiw, 1653.</ref>

In 1982 Kydland and Prescott also founded the theory of [[Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium|Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium]] (DSGE), large systems of microeconomic equations combined into models of the general economy, which became central to the [[New neoclassical synthesis|New Neoclassical Synthesis]], incorporating theoretical elements such as sticky prices from New Keynesian Macroeconomics. They shared the 2004 Nobel Economics Prize.

In 1977 [[Edmund Phelps]] (1933-) (who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Economics Prize) and [[John B. Taylor]] (1946-) published a paper proving that staggered setting of wages and prices gives monetary policy a role in stabilizing economic fluctuations if the wages/prices are [[Sticky (economics)|sticky]], even when all workers and firms have rational expectations, which caused Keynesian economics to make a comeback among mainstream economists with [[New Keynesian|New Keynesian Macroeconomics]]. Its central theme is the provision of a microeconomic foundation for Keynesian macroeconomics, obtained by identifying minimal deviations from the standard microeconomic assumptions which yield Keynesian macroeconomic conclusions, such as the possibility of significant welfare benefits from macroeconomic stabilization.<ref>Mankiw, 1655.</ref>

In 1985 [[George Akerlof]] (1940-) and his economist wife [[Janet Yellen]] (1946-) published [[menu cost]]s arguments showing that, under imperfect competition, small deviations from rationality generate significant (in welfare terms) [[sticky (economics)|price stickiness]].<ref>Mankiw, 1657.</ref>

In 1987 British economist [[Huw Dixon]] (1958-) published ''A simple model of imperfect competition with Walrasian features'', the first work to demonstrate in a simple general equilibrium model that the fiscal multiplier could be increasing with the degree of imperfect competition in the output market, helping develop New Keynesian economics.

In 1997 American economist [[Michael Woodford (economist)|Michael Woodford]] (1955-) and Argentine economist [[Julio Rotemberg]] (1953-) published the first paper describing a microfounded DSGE New Keynesian macroeconomic model.

==Sidney Weintraub, Paul Davidson and Post-Keynesian Economics==

==Robert E. Hall and the Flat Tax==

In 1981 American economist [[Robert Hall (economist)|Robert E. Hall]] (1943-) and American political scientist [[Alvin Rabushka]] proposed the [[Hall-Rabushka flat tax|Hall-Rabushka Flat Tax]] to simplify the U.S. federal income tax.

In 2010 the paper ''[[Growth in a Time of Debt]]'' by American economists [[Carmen Reinhart]] (1955-) and [[Kenneth Rogoff]] (1953-) was published, analyzing public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies and claiming that high debt countries grew at <U+2212>0.1% since WWII, which was accepted, setting the stage for a wave of fiscal austerity that swept Europe. In April 2013 some analysts at the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and the [[Roosevelt Institute]] exposed flaws in the Reinhart-Rogoff paper, claiming +2.2%.  On June 6, 2013 [[Paul Krugman]] published ''How the Case for Austerity Has Crumbled''<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jun/06/how-case-austerity-has-crumbled/?pagination=false]</ref> in ''The New York Review of Books'', arguing for an end to austerity measures.
