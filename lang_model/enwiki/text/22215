From 1913 to 1993, [[Montana]] had two [[congressional district]]s.  From 1913 to 1919, those seats were elected state-wide At-large on a general ticket.  After 1919, however, the state was divided into geographical districts.

The first and second districts, therefore, existed from 1919 to 1993.

After 1993, the second seat was eliminated and the remaining seat was elected [[At-large]].
