'''''NHL on Sportsnet''''' is an upcoming presentation of [[National Hockey League]] games to be broadcast by [[Sportsnet]] and other networks owned by [[Rogers Media]], to debut at the beginning of the [[2014<U+2013>15 NHL season]]. The arrangement will supersede the league's previous [[Canada|Canadian]] broadcast television and cable rights deals with [[Hockey Night in Canada|CBC]] and [[NHL on TSN|TSN]], that expired at the end of the [[2013<U+2013>14 NHL season]], and accompany its existing regional deals with four of Canada's NHL teams.

The deal primarily emphasizes increased access to NHL content in Canada, with plans to leverage Rogers' various broadcast and cable television outlets, along with [[CBC Television]], to air a larger number of NHL games nationally than under existing deals, with plans to nationally televise at least 7 games weekly on Saturday nights through a revamped ''Hockey Night in Canada'', along with a new primetime, Sunday night game of the week on [[City (TV network)|City]], and a Wednesday night game of the week on Sportsnet. Rogers has retained a number of prominent personalities from CBC to serve as part of its on-air staff, including commentators [[Jim Hughson]] and [[Bob Cole (sportscaster)|Bob Cole]], ''Coach's Corner'' hosts [[Don Cherry]] and [[Ron MacLean]], and reporters [[Elliotte Friedman]], and [[Scott Oake]]. Additionally, Rogers hired [[George Stroumboulopoulos]], who formerly hosted a [[George Stroumboulopoulos|talk show]] for CBC, to serve as the main host for its coverage.

Sportsnet (then known as CTV Sportsnet) previously held the national cable rights for NHL regular season and playoff games from [[1998<U+2013>99 NHL season|1998]] to [[2001<U+2013>02 NHL season|2002]].

== History ==
=== First NHL contract ===
[[Rogers Media]]'s [[Sportsnet]] networks have historically been a prominent broadcaster of the NHL. By the time the [[regional sports network]] first launched on October 9, 1998 as [[CTV Television|CTV]] Sportsnet, the network had already wrestled the national cable rights to the NHL from long-time holder [[NHL on TSN|TSN]]. From 1998<U+2013>99 until 2001<U+2013>02, Sportsnet aired ''[[Labatt Blue]] Tuesday Night Hockey'' weekly during the regular season, and covered first-round playoff series that did not feature Canadian teams. The network's first live event was an opening night match between the [[1998<U+2013>99 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[1998<U+2013>99 New York Rangers season|New York Rangers]].<ref name="sportsnetx">{{cite web|title=From inspiration to perspiration|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/more/2008/10/08/sportsnet_10yrs/|work=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Jim Hughson]] and [[Craig Simpson]] served as the lead broadcast team.<ref name=TorontoStar>{{cite news|title=Cruyff people's choice to coach Dutch team|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/444392141.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT|accessdate=May 7, 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 25, 1998}}</ref> [[Kevin Quinn (sportscaster)|Kevin Quinn]] and [[Ryan Walter]] served as the secondary team.<ref name=TorontoStar2 /> [[Darren Dreger]] was as the studio host<ref name=TorontoStar /> and [[Greg Millen]] (1998-1999),<ref>{{cite news|title=Sportsnet impresses, with a few exceptions|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/444506151.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT|accessdate=May 7, 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=October 11, 1998}}</ref> joined by other personalities such as [[Nick Kypreos]] (1998-2002),<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Kypreos Bio|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/bios/kypreos_nick/|work=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> and [[Mike Keenan]] (1999-2000).<ref name=TorontoStar2>{{cite news|title=CBC comes close to dream schedule|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/426701141.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT|accessdate=May 7, 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=April 11, 2000}}</ref>

As reflected by its influence, the [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] ([[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] held a minority stake in the channel on launch),<ref name="sportsnetx"/> Sportsnet and its four regional feeds also picked up regional broadcast rights to other Canadian NHL teams. As of the [[2013<U+2013>14 NHL season]], Sportsnet held regional rights to five of the seven Canadian franchises, including the [[Ottawa Senators]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] (which are jointly owned by Rogers and [[Bell Canada]] through a majority stake in [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment|MLSE]]), [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Calgary Flames]], and [[Vancouver Canucks]]. Rights to the remaining two, the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and [[Winnipeg Jets]] (along with the [[Ottawa Senators]] beginning in the 2014<U+2013>15 season), and national cable rights to the NHL, were held by the competing network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].<ref name=rogers-numbers>{{cite web|title=By The Numbers: Rogers and the NHL <U+2013> 2014<U+2013>15 Season|url=http://stream1.newswire.ca/media/2014/02/04/20140204_C7577_DOC_EN_36263.pdf|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=tsn-newsenscontract>{{cite web|title=TSN, TSN Radio 1200 become Senators' broadcasters|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=442467|work=TSN.ca|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name=sun-tsnsens>{{cite web|title=Senators to sign major new TV deal with Bell, TSN|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/01/28/senators-to-sign-major-new-tv-deal-with-bell-tsn|work=Ottawa Sun|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name=torstar-rogersnhl14/> National broadcast television rights were held by [[CBC Television]], who used its rights to broadcast the iconic ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' on Saturday nights, and share coverage of the post-season with TSN (including exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Finals).<ref name=torstar-rogersnhl14/>

=== 2014-15 contract ===
On November 26, 2013, Rogers Communications announced that it had reached a 12-year deal to become the exclusive national rightsholder for the National Hockey League beginning in the 2014<U+2013>15 season. Valued at $5.2 billion over the length of the contract, and covering television and digital rights to the league in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (French rights will be sub-licensed to [[Quebecor Media]] for [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] and [[TVA Sports]]), the value of the contract surpasses the league's most recent U.S. rights deal with [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] by more than double. Under the contract, Rogers paid $150 million upfront, and will make annual payments beginning at $300 million, escalating to $500 million over the life of the contract. Rogers will also take over Canadian distribution of the [[NHL Centre Ice]] and Game Centre Live services, and exclusive coverage of the [[NHL All-Star Game]] and [[NHL Entry Draft]]. Rogers Media president [[Keith Pelley]] emphasized the increased amount and accessibility of NHL content that Rogers planned to offer under the deal, stating that "Canadians will have more games, more content and more choice than they've ever had before."<ref name=gandm-rogersnhl14/><ref name=torstar-rogersnhl14/><ref name=cbcsports-rogers14/><ref name=cbcnews-rogersnhl/>

Critics considered the deal to be a major blow to [[Bell Media]], owner of TSN and its sister network [[R<U+00E9>seau des sports|RDS]], who had previously held the national cable rights to the league. The network still has existing broadcast rights deals with [[Hockey Canada]], and exclusive regional rights to the [[Winnipeg Jets]], [[Montreal Canadiens]], and new for the 2014<U+2013>15 season, the [[Ottawa Senators]].<ref name=tsn-newsenscontract>{{cite web|title=TSN, TSN Radio 1200 become Senators' broadcasters|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=442467|work=TSN.ca|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref> Also of note was Rogers' plans to maintain the long-running ''Hockey Night in Canada'' on CBC, but also extend the brand by airing ''Hockey Night'' games across its own networks alongside CBC.<ref name=gandm-rogersnhl14>{{cite news|title=Rogers reaches 12-year broadcast deal with NHL worth $5.2-billion|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rogers-reaches-12-year-broadcast-deal-with-nhl-worth-52-billion/article15600412/|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 26, 2013|location=Toronto|date=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=torstar-rogersnhl14>{{cite news|title=NHL signs 12-year TV, Internet deal with Rogers; CBC keeps <U+2018>Hockey Night in Canada<U+2019>|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2013/11/26/nhl_signs_12year_broadcast_deal_with_rogers_cbc_keeps_hockey_night_in_canada.html|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=November 26, 2013|date=November 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=cbcsports-rogers14>{{cite news|title=CBC partners with Rogers in landmark NHL rights deal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/cbc-partners-with-rogers-in-landmark-nhl-rights-deal-1.2440326|work=CBC Sports|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=cbcnews-rogersnhl>{{cite news|title=Rogers scores national NHL TV rights for $5.2B|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rogers-scores-national-nhl-tv-rights-for-5-2b-1.2440645|work=CBC News|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=torstar-hugeblow>{{cite news|title=NHL deal with Rogers a huge blow to TSN and CBC: Mudhar|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2013/11/26/nhl_deal_with_rogers_a_huge_blow_to_tsn_and_cbc_mudhar.html|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=November 26, 2013|date=November 26, 2013}}</ref>

Rogers will rent studio space from the CBC for its NHL broadcasts, which will be broadcast from Studio 41 of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Centre]]<U+2014>adjacent to Studio 42, the previous home of ''Hockey Night in Canada''.<ref name=snet-500games/> On February 4, 2014 at the NHL's upfronts, Rogers unveiled more detailed plans for its NHL coverage, incorporating its over-the-air [[City (TV network)|City]] network, [[FX Canada]], [[Sportsnet]], [[Sportsnet 360]], and [[Sportsnet One]].<ref name=snet-500games/><ref name=torstar-nhlplans>{{cite news|title=Rogers unveils plans for NHL broadcasts next season|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2014/02/04/rogers_unveils_plans_for_nhl_broadcasts_next_season.html|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=February 5, 2014|date=February 4, 2014}}</ref> In preparation for the transition, Rogers and the NHL sought input from viewers via online surveys and a "listening tour" through locations within Canadian NHL markets, along with [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. These efforts focused primarily on gauging how viewers (including "core" fans, younger viewers, and those new to the country) consume NHL content, and help determine how Rogers would present and market its overall coverage to these varying [[demographics]].<ref name=globeandmail-advisor>{{cite news|title=How do you like your hockey?

On May 28, 2014, Rogers announced a six-year sponsorship deal with [[Scotiabank]], which will see the bank become the title sponsor of Sportsnet's Wednesday night games and Hockey Day in Canada, and sponsor other segments and initiatives throughout its overall coverage.<ref name=torstar-scotiabank>{{cite web|title=Rogers and Scotiabank reach NHL sponsorship deal|url=http://www.thestar.com/business/2014/05/28/rogers_and_scotiabank_reach_nhl_sponsorship_deal.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name=sn-scotiabank>{{cite web|title=Rogers and Scotiabank Sign Six-Year NHL Media Sponsorship Agreement|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/rogers-and-scotiabank-sign-six-year-nhl-media-sponsorship-agreement/|work=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> In July 2014, Rogers began a marketing campaign, including television commercials and other forms of advertising across Rogers properties to promote its networks as the new home of the NHL.<ref name=globeandmail-adbuys>{{cite news|title=Rogers ramps up NHL ad buys|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/rogers-ramps-up-nhl-ad-buys/article19479990/|accessdate=July 15, 2014|work=The Globe & Mail|date=July 6, 2014}}</ref>

== Coverage ==
In its inaugural season, Rogers plans to air at least 500 games across CBC and Rogers-owned properties. On Wednesday nights, Sportsnet will air ''Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey''; the network will have an exclusive window where no other broadcaster may air NHL games in Canada. [[Sportsnet 360]] and [[Sportsnet One]] will air around 100 games involving U.S. teams throughout the season. Sportsnet will also expand its nightly news and highlight program ''[[Hockey Central]]'' to a full hour daily, and add a two-hour pre-game show preceding ''Hockey Night in Canada''.<ref name=snet-500games/><ref name=torstar-nhlplans/>

=== ''Hockey Night in Canada'' ===
''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' will maintain its traditional Saturday night window, but will no longer air games on a regional basis split across CBC affiliates. Instead, games will be split across CBC and other Rogers and Quebecor channels (including City, Sportsnet, Sportsnet One, Sportsnet 360, and [[FX Canada]]), and will all be aired nationally. Three to five games will air during the early, 7:00 p.m. ET window, and two more will air on Sportsnet and CBC for the 10:00 p.m. ET/7:00 p.m. PT west coast window. Rogers touted a 300% increase in the number of ''Hockey Night'' games available nationally under the new arrangement.<ref name=torstar-rogersnhl14/><ref name=snet-500games>{{cite web|title=500-plus NHL games to air under Rogers deal|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nearly-500-nhl-games-to-air-under-rogers-deal/|work=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=torstar-nhlplans/><ref name=rogers-numbers>{{cite web|title=By The Numbers: Rogers and the NHL <U+2013> 2014<U+2013>15 Season|url=http://stream1.newswire.ca/media/2014/02/04/20140204_C7577_DOC_EN_36263.pdf|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Though split national/regional broadcasts are possible, arrangements will be made to ensure that viewers have on-air access to any games affected, ensuring that no Saturday night game will be unavailable to viewers on a regional basis.<ref name=cbcsports-rogers14/>

Rogers will handle the production of all ''Hockey Night'' games and sell all advertising time, though it will give CBC advertising time for its own programming across its networks during the games. While CBC will not pay a rights fee, Rogers will retain all profits from advertising. As for the on-air makeup of the ''Hockey Night'' broadcasts, Rogers management stated that reviews of content and production would take place in the months leading up to the launch of the new season. The review will include retaining and sharing of personnel (including announcers) and ancillary content. In announcing the deal, Rogers Media's president [[Keith Pelley]] considered CBC's staff to be "legendary" (and considered [[Don Cherry]] to be an "iconic Canadian", inferring that [[Ron MacLean]] and Don Cherry's ''Coach's Corner'' segment would be retained, and theoretically stated that under the arrangement, ''Hockey Night'' personalities "could appear on seven different networks".<ref name=torstar-rogersnhl14/><ref name="torstar-hugeblow"/><ref name=torstar-nhlplans/> The arrangement will not be the first time Cherry has done work for Rogers, as its [[Sportsnet Radio|Sportsnet Radio Network]] produces ''Grapeline'', a syndicated radio segment with himself and fellow sportscaster [[Brian Williams (sportscaster)|Brian Williams]] (who, ironically, works for rival channel [[The Sports Network|TSN]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/pressroom/2011/05/12/cherry_williams/|title="GRAPELINE" WITH DON CHERRY AND BRIAN WILLIAMS RETURNS FOR A 28TH SEASON ON SPORTSNET RADIO THE FAN 590|author=[[Rogers Media]]|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> 

CBC President [[Hubert T. Lacroix]], in notifying CBC employees of the deal in an internal memo, noted that the new sub-licensing arrangement with Rogers "may not be the ideal scenario [for the CBC] but, it is the right outcome for Canadian hockey fans" as it allows NHL hockey and the ''Hockey Night'' brand to remain on CBC and be made available to a wider audience with minimal cost to the public broadcaster, which has gone through reductions in funding in recent years and will likely face reductions in staffing and revenue as a result of its agreement with Rogers<U+2014>as ''Hockey Night'' had been estimated to provide half of CBC Television's total advertising revenue.<ref name=torstar-hugeblow/>  Lacroix, in his memo, believed that CBC's non-hockey content would remain well-promoted on the new ''Hockey Night'', and that being shut out of the package entirely would have been a major blow to the CBC's prestige.<ref name=CBCMemo>{{cite web|last=Lacroix|first=Hubert T|title=Hubert T.

The loss of ''Hockey Night'' was cited as a factor to the budget cuts, but was also credited to the performance of CBC's entertainment programming.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cbc-to-cut-657-jobs-will-no-longer-compete-for-professional-sports-rights-1.2605504|title=CBC to cut 657 jobs, will no longer compete for professional sports rights|publisher=CBC News|date=April 10, 2014|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref>

=== ''Hometown Hockey'' ===
During the regular season, [[City (TV network)|City]] will broadcast a new, Sunday night game of the week entitled ''Hometown Hockey''. The games will incorporate player profiles and other special features originating from various Canadian communities, where Ron MacLean will host on-location. [[London, Ontario]] will serve as the first <ref name=cp-stroumohnicofficial/><ref name=snet-500games/><ref name=torstar-nhlplans/> [[London, Ontario]] will host the first broadcast, scheduled for October 12, 2014.<ref name=980-firstcity>{{cite news|title=Rogers Announces London as First Stop for <U+201C>Hometown Hockey<U+201D> NHL Broadcast|url=http://www.am980.ca/2014/07/02/21789/|accessdate=July 15, 2014|work=AM980.ca|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]}}</ref>

=== Post-season ===
Sportsnet and CBC will share in coverage of the [[Stanley Cup Playoffs]], and CBC will retain coverage of the [[Stanley Cup Final]], though it may be possible for Finals coverage to be simulcast on a Rogers network (similarly to the mass simulcast of the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics <U+2013> Men's tournament|Men's hockey gold medal game]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]) if needed.<ref name=cbcsports-rogers14/>

== Personalities ==
On March 10, 2014, Rogers officially announced that [[George Stroumboulopoulos]] (who himself previously worked as a host on [[CJCL]] in Toronto) would serve as the main host of its NHL coverage; he will be joined by Sportsnet's [[Daren Millard]] and [[Jeff Marek]]. [[Ron MacLean]] will no longer host ''Hockey Night in Canada'', but will still be joined by [[Don Cherry]] for their traditional ''Coach's Corner'' segment, and MacLean will serve as the on-location host for the Sunday night ''Hometown Hockey'' games (with Stroumboulopoulos serving as studio host). Concurrently, CBC announced that Stroumboulopoulos's [[talk show]], ''[[George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight]]'', would end after a 10-year run. Daren Millard will primarily host ''Wednesday Night Hockey'', while Jeff Marek will primarily host ''Thursday Night Hockey'' along with the ''Hockey Night'' pre-game show.<ref name=cp-stroumohnicofficial>{{cite news|title=Stroumboulopoulos named <U+2018>Hockey Night in Canada<U+2019> host|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/stroumboulopoulos-to-take-over-for-maclean-as-new-host-of-hockey-night-in-canada/article17390692/|accessdate=March 10, 2014|agency=Canadian Press|location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|date=March 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=cbcn-georgenhl>{{cite news|title=George Stroumboulopoulos to host Hockey Night in Canada next season|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/george-stroumboulopoulos-to-host-hockey-night-in-canada-next-season-1.2566664|work=CBC News|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref>

On June 3, 2014, Rogers announced the [[play-by-play]] staff for its NHL coverage; [[Jim Hughson]] and [[Bob Cole (sportscaster)|Bob Cole]] will retain their roles from ''Hockey Night in Canada'', joined by former TSN personalities [[Dave Randorf]] and [[Paul Romanuk]].<ref name=sn-fullteam>{{cite web|title=Rogers unveils its full NHL play-by-play team|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/bob-cole-among-rogers-play-by-play-team-for-nhl/|website=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=np-hughson>{{cite news|title=Jim Hughson to lead play-by-play when Rogers takes over NHL rights next season|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/06/03/jim-hughson-to-lead-play-by-play-when-rogers-takes-over-nhl-rights-next-season/|accessdate=June 3, 2014|agency=National Post}}</ref> On June 17, 2014, it was announced on ''[[Prime Time Sports]]'' that ''Hockey Night'' reporters [[Elliotte Friedman]] and [[Scott Oake]] would also join Sportsnet.<ref name=sn-elliotte>{{cite web|title=Elliotte Friedman and Scott Oake Join Rogers NHL Broadcast Team|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/elliotte-friedman-and-scott-oake-join-rogers-nhl-broadcast-team/|website=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref>
