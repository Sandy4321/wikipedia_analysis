The '''International Geophysical Year (IGY)''' was an international scientific project that lasted from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958.  It marked the end, after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, of a long period during the [[Cold War]] when scientific interchange between East and West was seriously interrupted. 67 countries participated, although one notable exception was mainland [[China]], which was protesting against the participation of the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]). East and West agreed to nominate the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Marcel Nicolet]] as secretary general of the associated international organization.

The IGY encompassed eleven [[Earth science]]s: [[Auroral light|aurora]] and [[airglow]], [[cosmic ray]]s, [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetism]], [[gravity]], [[ionosphere|ionospheric physics]], [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] determinations (precision mapping), [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[seismology]], and [[Space weather|solar activity]].

Both the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] launched artificial [[satellite]]s for this event; the Soviet Union's ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', launched on October 4, 1957, was the first successful artificial satellite. Other significant achievements of the IGY included the discovery of the [[Van Allen Belt|Van Allen radiation belts]] and the discovery of mid-ocean submarine ridges, an important confirmation of [[plate tectonics]].<ref>[http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/obop/spo/igy_history.html ESRL Global Monitoring Division<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also detected was the rare occurrence of hard solar corpuscular radiation that could be highly dangerous for manned [[space flight]].

==Events==
The International Geophysical Year traces its origins to the '''[[International Polar Year]]s,''' which had been held in 1882<U+2013>1883 and 1932<U+2013>1933 (and more recently in 2007<U+2013>2009). In March 1950, several top scientists (including [[Lloyd Berkner]], [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]], [[Fred Singer|S. Fred Singer]], and Harry Vestine), met in [[James Van Allen]]'s living room and suggested that the time was ripe to have a worldwide Geophysical Year instead of a Polar Year, especially considering recent advances in rocketry, radar, and computing. Following the March 1950 meeting, Berkner and Chapman proposed to the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]] that an International Geophysical Year (IGY) be planned for 1957<U+2013>58, coinciding with an approaching period of maximum solar activity.<ref>[http://www.nas.edu/history/igy The International Geophysical Year, 1957/1958<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Matthew Kohut |title=Shaping the Space Age: The International Geophysical Year |journal=ASK Magazine |issue=32 |publisher=NASA |date=Fall 2008 |url=http://askmagazine.nasa.gov/issues/32/32i_shaping_the_space_age.html |accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref>

On 29 July 1955, [[James C. Hagerty]], president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s press secretary, announced that the United States intended to launch "small Earth circling satellites" between 1 July 1957 and 31 December 1958 as part of the United States contribution to the International Geophysical Year (IGY).  [[Project Vanguard]] would be managed by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] and to be based on developing [[sounding rocket]]s, which had the advantage that they were primarily used for non-military scientific experiments.<ref>http://www.nrl.navy.mil/accomplishments/rockets/vanguard-project/</ref>

Four days later, at the [[International Astronautical Federation|Sixth Congress of International Astronautical Federation]] in Copenhagen, scientist [[Leonid I. Sedov]] spoke to international reporters at the Soviet embassy, and announced his country's intention to launch a satellite as well, in the "near future".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Race: The uncensored story of how America beat Russia to the Moon |last=Schefter |first=James |year= 999 |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=New York |isbn=0-385-49253-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Y7m6edRkG2EC&dq=isbn%3A0385492537

To the surprise of many, the [[USSR]] launched [[Sputnik 1]] as the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957. After several failed Vanguard launches, [[Wernher von Braun]] and his team convinced President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to use one of their US Army missiles for the Explorer program (there then being no inhibition about using military rockets to get into space). On November 8, 1957, the US Secretary of Defense instructed the US Army to use a modified [[Jupiter-C]] rocket to launch a satellite. The US achieved this goal only four months later with [[Explorer 1]], on February 1, 1958, but after [[Sputnik 2]] in November 3, 1957, making Explorer 1 the third artificial Earth satellite. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] victory in the "[[Space Race]]" would be followed by considerable political consequences,<ref name=Egermeier>{{Citation

one of which was the creation of the US space agency [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] on July 29, 1958.

The British-American survey of the Atlantic, carried out between September 1954 and July 1959, that discovered the mid-Atlantic ridges (plate tectonics), was a major discovery during the IGY.

==World Data Centers==
Although the 1932 Polar Year accomplished many of its goals, it fell short on others because of the advance of World War II. In fact, because of the war, much of the data collected and scientific analyses completed during the 1932 Polar Year were lost forever.

The potential loss of data to war and politics was particularly troubling to the IGY organizing committee. The committee resolved that "all observational data shall be available to scientists and scientific institutions in all countries." They felt that without the free exchange of data across international borders, there would be no point in having an IGY.

In April 1957, just three months before the IGY began, scientists representing the various disciplines of the IGY established the World Data Center system. The United States hosted World Data Center "A" and the Soviet Union hosted World Data Center "B." World Data Center "C" was subdivided among countries in Western Europe, Australia, and Japan. Today, NOAA hosts seven of the fifteen World Data Centers in the United States.

Each World Data Center would eventually archive a complete set of IGY data to deter losses prevalent during the International Polar Year of 1932. Each World Data Center was equipped to handle many different data formats, including computer punch cards and tape<U+2014>the original computer media. In addition, each host country agreed to abide by the organizing committee<U+2019>s resolution that there should be a free and open exchange of data among nations.

==Antarctica==

IGY triggered an 18-month year of Antarctic science. The [[International Council of Scientific Unions]], a parent body, broadened the proposals from polar studies to geophysical research. More than 70 existing national scientific organizations then formed IGY committees, and participated in the cooperative effort.

[[Halley Research Station]] was founded in 1956, for IGY, by an expedition from the [[Royal Society]]. The bay where the expedition set up their base was named Halley Bay, after the astronomer [[Edmond Halley]].

In Japan, the Antarctic exploration was planned in 1955 by [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Monbush<U+014D> and Science and technology Agency]]. [[Japan Coast Guard|Japan Maritime Safety Agency]] offered [[ice breaker]] [[S<U+014D>ya (icebreaker)|S<U+014D>ya]] as the South Pole observation ship. The first Antarctic observation corps commanded by [[Takeshi Nagata]] left Japan in 1956, arriving at Antarctica on January 29, 1957. [[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa Station]] was the first Japanese observation base on Antarctica and was set up on same day.

France contributed with [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] and [[Charcot Station]] in [[Ad<U+00E9>lie Land]]. As a forerunner expedition, the ship ''Commandant Charcot'' of the [[French Navy]] spent nine months of 1949/50 at the coast of Adelie Land.  [[Ionosphere|Ionospheric]] soundings were performed aboard this ship.<ref>M. Barr<U+00E9>, K. Rawer: "Quelques r<U+00E9>sultats d<U+2019>observations ionosph<U+00E9>riques effectu<U+00E9>es pr<U+00E8>s de la Terre Ad<U+00E9>lie". ''Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics'' volume 1, issue 5<U+2013>6 (1951), pp. 311<U+2013>314.</ref> The first French station, [[Port Martin]], was completed April 9, 1950, but destroyed by fire the night of January 22 to 23, 1952.

The [[Amundsen<U+2013>Scott South Pole Station]] was erected as the first permanent structure at the South Pole in January 1957. It survived intact for 53 years, but was slowly buried in the ice (as all structures there eventually sink into the icy crust), until it was demolished in December 2010 for safety reasons.<ref>

==Legacy==
In the end, the IGY was a resounding success. In some fields, data collection was incomplete, and so informal extensions were added and new cooperative efforts were forged.

The IGY led to several advancements that live on today. 
For example, the work of the IGY led directly to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], which called for the use of Antarctica for peaceful purposes and cooperative scientific research. Since then, international cooperation has led to protecting the Antarctic environment, preserving historic sites, and conserving the animals and plants. Today, 41 nations have signed the Treaty and international collaborative research continues.

The [[ICSU]] [[World Data System]] (WDS) was created by the 29th General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and builds on the 50-year legacy of the former ICSU World Data Centres (WDCs) and former Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical data-analysis Services (FAGS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icsu-wds.org/organization/intro-to-wds |title=Introduction to ICSU World Data System |publisher=ICSU |accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>

This [[World Data System]], hosts the repositories for data collected during the IGY.
Seven of the 15 World Data Centers in the United States are co-located at NOAA National Data Centers or at NOAA affiliates. 
These [[ICSC]] Data Centers not only preserve historical data, but also promote research and ongoing data collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icsu-wds.org/ |title=ICSU World Data System |publisher=ICSU |accessdate=17 July 2013 }}</ref>

The fourth International Polar Year on 2007-2008 focused on climate change and its effects on the polar environment. Sixty countries participated in this effort and it will include studies in the Arctic and Antarctic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipy.org/ |title=International Polar Year 2007-2008 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>

==IGY representations in popular culture==
*"[[I.G.Y. (What a Beautiful World)]]" is a track on [[Steely Dan]] founding member [[Donald Fagen]]'s 1982 album, ''[[The Nightfly]].'' The song is sung from an optimistic viewpoint during the IGY, and features references to then-futuristic concepts, such as [[solar power]] (first used in 1958), [[Spandex]] (invented in 1959), [[Space tourism|space travel for entertainment]], and undersea international [[high speed rail]].<ref>SteelyDan.com page: "[http://www.steelydan.com/lyrnightfly.html ''The Nightfly'' lyrics]".</ref> The song peaked at #26 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] on 27 November <U+2013> 11 December 1982.

*The IGY is featured prominently during 1957&ndash;1958 run of ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strips by [[Walt Kelly]]. The characters in the strip refer to the scientific initiative as the "G.O. Fizzickle Year." During this run, the characters try to make their own contributions to scientific endeavours, such as putting a flea on the moon. A subsequent compilation of the strips was published by ''Simon & Schuster SC'' in 1958 as ''G.O. Fizzickle Pogo'' and later ''Pogo's Will Be That Was'' in 1979.

*The IGY was featured in a cartoon by [[Brockbank|Russell Brockbank]] in ''[[Punch magazine]]'' in November 1956. It shows the three main superpowers UK, USA and USSR at the South Pole, each with a gathering of penguins whom they are trying to educate with "culture". The penguins in the British camp are being bored with [[Francis Bacon]]; in the American camp they are happily playing baseball, while the Russian camp resembles a [[gulag]], with barbed-wire fences and the penguins are made to march and perform military maneuvers.

*In the concluding remarks of episode 25, season 3 of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' titled "Flight to the East", Hitchcock remarks to the audience, "Until then, good night and a happy International Geophysical Year to all of you."

*Reporters came along for the IGY, including ''New York Times'' reporter [[Bill Becker]].<ref>M'MURDO IS HUB OF A MAN'S LAND; Cold Man's World of Antarctica Is the Way U.S. Volunteers Like It, ''New York Times'', November 5, 1957 page 33.
