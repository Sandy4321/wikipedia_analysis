'''John Deere''' ([[February 7]], [[1804]] &ndash; [[May 17]], [[1886]]) was an American blacksmith and manufacturer who founded [[Deere & Company]]&mdash; the largest agricultural and construction equipment manufacturers in the world. Born in [[Rutland, Vermont]], Deere moved to Illinois and invented the first [[steel plow]] in 1837.

==Early life==
Deere was born in [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] on February 7, 1804, the son of William Rinold Deere, a tailor, and Sarah Yates (1780-1826). William Deere disappeared on the way to [[England]] in 1808 when a young John Deere was only four, where he was seeking a possible inheritance. John Deere received a basic education from the local [[common school]] and briefly attended [[Middlebury College]] before dropping out.  With no inheritance and a meager education, he was apprenticed in 1821, at age 17, by his mother.  He served four years as apprentice to Captain Benjamin Lawrence, a prosperous Middlebury blacksmith, and entered the trade for himself in 1825.<ref name=yates>"[http://www.deere.com/en_US/compinfo/student/SarahYatesDeerebio.html The Women in John Deere's Life: Sarah Yates Deere 1780-1826]," ''Deere & Company'', official website.

Deere settled in [[Grand Detour, Illinois]].  As there were no other blacksmiths in the area, he had no difficulty finding work. Growing up in his father<U+2019>s Rutland, Vermont, tailor shop, Deere had polished and sharpened needles by running them through sand.  This polishing helped the needles sew through tough leather.<ref name=toytractor>"[http://www.toytractortimes.com/january07/ 170 Years of John Deere]," ''The Toy Tractor Times'', January 2007. Retrieved [[22 May]] [[2007]].</ref> Deere found that cast-iron plows were not working very well in the tough [[prairie]] soil of Illinois and remembered the polished needles.<ref name=toytractor/> Deere came to the conclusion that a plow made out of highly polished steel and a correctly shaped moldboard (the self-scouring steel plow) would be better able to handle the soil conditions of the prairie, especially its sticky clay. <ref>Attoun, Marti.

There are varying versions of the inspiration for Deere's famous invention, the steel plow. In another version he recalled the way the polished steel [[pitchfork]] tines moved through hay and soil and thought that same effect could be obtained for a plow.<ref name=leffingwell/> 

In 1837, Deere developed and manufactured the first commercially successful [[Steel plow|cast-steel plow]]. The wrought-iron framed plow had a polished steel share, which made it ideal for the tough soil of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and worked better than other plows.<ref name=leffingwell>Leffingwell, Randy.

Retrieved [[21 May]], [[2007]].</ref> By early 1838, Deere completed his first [[steel plow]] and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall, who quickly spread word of his success with Deere's plow. So two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. Confident that he had some stability, Deere moved his family to Grand Detour later that year.{{cn}} By 1841, Deere was manufacturing 75-100 plows per year.<ref name=leffingwell/>

In 1843, Deere partnered with Leonard Andrus to produce more plows to keep up with demand.  However, the partnership became strained due to the two men's stubbornness - while Deere wished to sell to customers outside Grand Detour, Andrus opposed a proposed railroad through Grand Detour - and Deere's distrust of Andrus' accounting practices. <ref>Dahlstrom, Neil and Dahlstrom, Jeremy.''The John Deere Story:  A Biography of Plowmakers John & Charles Deere.'' Northern Illinois University Press, 2005, pg. 18</ref> In 1848, Deere dissolved the partnership with Andrus and moved to [[Moline, Illinois]], because of the city's location on the [[Mississippi River]], which helped make it a transportation hub.{{cn}}  By 1855, Deere's factory sold more than 10,000 such plows.{{cn}}  

From the beginning, Deere insisted on making high-quality equipment.  He once said, "I will never put my name on a product that does not have in it the best that is in me."{{cn}} As the business improved, Deere left the day-to-day operations to his son [[Charles Deere|Charles]].{{cn}}  In 1868, Deere incorporated his business as [[Deere & Company]].{{cn}}

==Late life==
Later in life Deere focused most of his attention on civil and political affairs. He served as President of the National Bank of Moline, a director of the Moline Free Public Library, and was a trustee of the First Congregational Church.<ref name=deerebio/><ref name=leaders>"[http://www.deere.com/en_US/compinfo/student/JohnDeerebio.html John Deere: Founder and President 1837-1886]," ''Deere & Company'', official website. Retrieved [[22 May]] [[2007]].</ref> Deere also served as [[Moline, Illinois|Moline's]] second [[mayor]] for a two year term, where despite his disastrous handling of liquor licensing, Deere improved the city's infrastructure by having streetlights, sewage and water piping (including fire hydrants) installed and sidewalks repaired, and bought eighty-three acres for $15,000 for the creation of a city park. Due to chest pains and dysentery Deere refused to run for a second term. <ref>Dahlstrom, Neil and Dahlstrom, Jeremy.''The John Deere Story: A Biography of Plowmakers John & Charles Deere.'' Northern Illinois University Press, 2005, pgs. 101-104</ref> <ref name=deerebio/> Deere died at home on [[May 17]], [[1886]].

The company Deere founded lived on after his death and has become the world's leading provider of advanced products and services for agriculture and forestry and a major provider of advanced products and services for construction, lawn and turf care, landscaping and irrigation. <ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/pure-genius-the-inventors-hall-of-fame-785519.html Pure genius: The Inventor's Hall of Fame</ref>
