==Career==
===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment===
====2002====
In 2000, after the successfully ending college, Lesnar signed up with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], a [[professional wrestling promotion]] later known as World Wrestling Entertainment in mid-2002. Lesnar was sent to its developmental territory, [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]]. There, Lesnar formed a [[tag team]] known as the Minnesota Stretching Crew with his former college roommate, [[Shelton Benjamin]]. Lesnar and Benjamin won the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] on three occasions.<ref name="OVW tag"/> Lesnar wrestled several [[List of professional wrestling slang#D|dark match]]es in 2001 and 2002 before being called up to the main roster.<ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/brock-lesnar.html|title=Brock Lesnar profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

Lesnar debuted on WWF television on the [[March 18]] [[2002]] episode of [[WWE Raw|''WWF Raw'']], attacking [[Al Snow]], [[Maven Huffman|Maven]], and [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] in the course of a match. He was accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]], who was seen giving instructions to Lesnar.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title = WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition| publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003|pages=106|language=English}}</ref> When the [[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]] was introduced in the WWF, Lesnar was [[WWE Brand Extension#Raw and SmackDown!|drafted]] to the RAW brand.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003|pages=102|language=English}}</ref> Later, Heyman was confirmed to be Lesnar's [[Manager (professional wrestling)|agent]] and gave Lesnar the nickname "The Next Big Thing."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=22&num=18700|title=Brock Lesnar|publisher=National Ledger|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>

Lesnar's first [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] was with the [[Hardy Boyz]]. Lesnar and [[Jeff Hardy]] squared off at [[WWE Backlash#2002|Backlash]] in Lesnar's first official televised match.<ref name="OWOW"/> Lesnar dominated Hardy and won the match by knockout.<ref>{{cite news|author=PWI Staff|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling<U+2019>s historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages= 125|language=English}}</ref> The next night on ''Raw'', he faced [[Matt Hardy]], defeating him in the same fashion.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003|pages=32}}</ref> At [[WWE Judgment Day#2002|Judgment Day]], Lesnar once again gained the upper hand on the Hardy Boyz before tagging his partner, Heyman, in to take the win.<ref name=pwi111>{{cite news|author=PWI Staff|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling<U+2019>s historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages= 110-111}}</ref>

In June 2002, Lesnar won the [[King of the Ring#2002|King of the Ring]] tournament, defeating [[Rob Van Dam]] in the final round.<ref name="KOTR"/> This victory earned him a shot at the [[WWE Championship|WWE Undisputed Championship]] at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]].<ref name=pwi111/> On July 22, Lesnar joined the [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]] brand.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher= Pocket Books|date=2003|pages=198-199}}</ref> After an angle with [[Hulk Hogan]] in August 2002 in which Lesnar defeated Hogan, Lesnar began feuding with the Undisputed Champion [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003|pages=200}}</ref> At the main event of SummerSlam, Lesnar defeated The Rock to become the new and final WWE Undisputed Champion.<ref name=pwi111/> Lesnar, at age 25, was the then-youngest WWE Champion ever (as of 2008, he is still technically the youngest WWE Champion ever, but [[Randy Orton]] is the youngest World Champion in WWE history, having won the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] at 24).<ref name=pwi111/> Due to the requirements of the WWE Undisputed Championship being defended on both shows, Raw [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General manager|general manager]] [[Eric Bischoff]] expected Lesnar to be able to return to Raw the next night. In response, SmackDown! general manager [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that Lesnar's contract only required him to defend the title on SmackDown!, forcing Bischoff to create the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] for the Raw brand, in turn making the [[Undisputed Championship|WWE Undisputed Championship]] lose its "Undisputed" name.<ref>{{cite news| author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003| pages=220-222}}</ref>

Lesnar's rapid rise to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a match between him and [[The Undertaker]] at [[WWE Unforgiven#2002|Unforgiven]].<ref name=pwi111/> It ended in a double disqualification leading to Lesnar retaining the title. The next month, at [[WWE No Mercy#2002|No Mercy]], he faced The Undertaker again, this time in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match. Leading up to the match, Lesnar broke the Undertaker's hand with a propane tank.<ref>{{cite news|author= Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003|pages= 281}}</ref> Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date=2003|pages=285}}</ref> In a match that saw both wrestlers and even Heyman covered in blood, it ended when Lesnar reversed an attempted [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone Piledriver|Tombstone piledriver]] into his finishing [[Facebuster#F-5|F-5]] maneuver for the win.<ref name=pwi111/> Six days after his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained his WWE title in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] with Heyman at the [[WWE Rebellion#2002|Rebellion 2002]] pay-per-view against [[Adam Copeland|Edge]].<ref>{{cite news|author=PWI Staff|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling<U+2019>s historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=111-112}}</ref>

Lesnar's next opponent was [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]. Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, trying to talk him out of defending the title.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|date= 2003|pages=290|language=English}}</ref> Lesnar refused and lost the championship in [[Madison Square Garden]] at the [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view to Big Show when after giving an F-5 to the 500-pounder, he was betrayed by Heyman.

====2003====
At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|2003 Royal Rumble]] event, Lesnar defeated [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] in a qualification match where the winner could enter the [[Royal Rumble#Royal Rumble match|Royal Rumble match]]. Lesnar later entered the Rumble as the #29 entrant where he eventually won by eliminating [[The Undertaker]].<ref name=pwi112/>

[[Image:Lesnarbotch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Lesnar suffered a concussion after botching a shooting star press at [[WrestleMania XIX]].]]
After winning the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar spent the next two months feuding with WWE champion [[Kurt Angle]], who Lesnar had helped win the title and who also was represented by Paul Heyman. Angle had Heyman, and [[The World's Greatest Tag Team|Team Angle]], Shelton Benjamin and [[Charlie Haas]], behind him, but Lesnar overcame these opponents.<ref name=pwi112/> The match between Lesnar and Angle going into [[WrestleMania XIX]] proved a historical moment as it marked the first time in WWE history that two accomplished amateur wrestlers met in a ring. Lesnar regained the WWE Championship in the main event of WrestleMania XIX. Toward the end of the match, he botched a [[professional wrestling aerial techniques#shooting star press|shooting star press]]; despite having landed the move successfully several times in OVW, in this match he overestimated the distance he was capable of jumping for the move and under-rotated, slamming his head into Angle's side and ribcage. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle to improvise the finish of the match. Lesnar suffered a severe [[concussion]] from the botched move.<ref name=pwi112/>

Following WrestleMania, [[John Cena]] began targeting Lesnar for almost ending his career (by using the F-5 to propel his leg into a ring post) after a previous match between the two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/j/john-cena.html|title=John Cena profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=Brock Lesnar defeated John Cena, then gave Cena an F5 into the ringpost, injuring his knee!|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> This led to Cena receiving a title match at [[Backlash (2003)|Backlash]]. Lesnar successfully retained his title against Cena. Earlier at the Backlash pay-per-view, Big Show had injured [[Oscar Gutierrez|Rey Mysterio]] badly, resulting in Mysterio being carried out on a [[stretcher]].<ref name=pwi112/> This led to Lesnar renewing his feud with Big Show, which led to a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]] at [[WWE Judgment Day#2003|Judgment Day]] for the title. Lesnar successfully retained his title with help from Rey Mysterio and a [[forklift truck|forklift]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/may/2003.htm|title=Judgment Day 2003 results|publisher=PWWEW.net |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> A famous ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' moment was made in a later rematch between the two, when Lesnar lifted Big Show over in a [[Suplex#Superplex|Superplex]] which caused the ring to collapse on impact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030612.html|title=SmackDown! results - June 12, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> At [[Vengeance (2003)|Vengeance]], Lesnar lost his title to Kurt Angle in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Disqualification]] [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] that also involved Big Show.<ref name=pwi112/>

Lesnar's first challenger for his newly won title was The Undertaker. Lesnar had previously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then-champion Kurt Angle, which granted him a shot at Lesnar's title.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030925.html|title=SmackDown! results - September 25, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> At [[WWE No Mercy#2003|No Mercy]], Lesnar defeated Undertaker in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Biker Chain match]], making it the second year Lesnar defeated Undertaker to retain the WWE Championship in the main event of No Mercy.<ref name=pwi114>{{cite news|author=PWI Staff|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling<U+2019>s historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=114}}</ref>

Lesnar realigned himself with Paul Heyman after Heyman became general manager of ''SmackDown!'' and formed Team Lesnar with Big Show, [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]], [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]], and [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] for a 10-man Survivor Series match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/031030.html|title=SmackDown! results - October 30, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> In the climax of the match, [[Chris Benoit]] became the second person to make Lesnar tap out.<ref name=pwi114/> Lesnar faced Benoit in a singles bout two weeks later for the WWE Championship on ''SmackDown!'', where Lesnar won after Benoit [[fainting|passed out]] to Lesnar's debuting [[Professional wrestling holds#Argentine leglock|Brock Lock]] submission hold.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/031204.html|title=SmackDown! results - December 4, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> The Survivor Series event also marked the first time Lesnar met [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] from the RAW brand, a man to whom Lesnar had been compared due to their similar [[wiktionary:physique|physiques]] and undefeated streaks in wrestling. Lesnar claimed in a backstage [[interview]] that he could beat anybody in the world, leading to Goldberg interrupting the interview and introducing himself to Lesnar, [[handshake|shaking hands]] with him before leaving with a staredown.<ref name=pwi114/>

Lesnar followed this with a brief feud involving [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/031211.html|title=SmackDown! results - December 11, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> In this storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] breaking his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002. During that match, Lesnar went for a [[powerbomb]], but Holly, believed by some to be uncooperative with rookies, supposedly [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|sandbagged]] mid-lift so that Lesnar could not get him all the way up. Holly compounded the difficulty of the move by not lifting up at the waist. During the struggle, Lesnar (intentionally or unintentionally) planted Holly on his head, leaving him in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/tuesday/021008.html|title=Wrestling news report - October 8, 2002|publisher=Slash Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> Lesnar never apologized and even showed insult to injury after the incident. The feud was closed when Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship at the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|2004 Royal Rumble]]. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg and delivered an F-5, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him.<ref name=pwi114/>

====2004====
In February, Lesnar faced [[Eddie Guerrero]] for the title at [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]]. During the match, Goldberg interfered twice in the match, eventually allowing Guerrero to capitalize and pin Lesnar after a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|frog splash]] to win the [[WWE Championship]]. The match set up an interbrand match for [[WrestleMania XX]] between Lesnar and Goldberg.<ref>{{cite news|author=PWI Staff|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling<U+2019>s historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=115}}</ref> During the feud with Goldberg, Lesnar also was feuding with ''RAW'''s [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] (who was shown suggesting to Goldberg that he attack Lesnar at No Way Out).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/040202.html|title=RAW results - February 2, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> When Lesnar attacked Austin on ''Raw'' and stole his [[All-terrain vehicle|four-wheeler]], Austin was inserted as the special guest referee for the WrestleMania match.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/040304.html|title=RAW results - March 4, 2004|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match would be Goldberg's last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, however, rumors surfaced Lesnar, too, was leaving in order to pursue a career in the [[National Football League]]. As a result, Lesnar's match with Goldberg became a fiasco as the fans at [[Madison Square Garden]] jeered both wrestlers with very loud and distinct chants of "[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye|na na, hey hey goodbye]]" and "you sold out," with the crowd support mostly given to special referee Austin. Although Goldberg won the match, both men were given a [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] by Austin on their way out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/31151|title= WrestleMania XX results|publisher=411mania|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>

===National Football League===
After his final match at [[WrestleMania XX]], Lesnar sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the [[National Football League]].<ref name="start NFL">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/16/384461.html|title=Lesnar talks about starting with the NFL|publisher=SLAM! Sports|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> This move upset many in WWE, as the company had invested heavily in Lesnar. World Wrestling Entertainment confirmed Lesnar's departure on their official website WWE.com by the statement 

{{Quote|Brock Lesnar has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to tryout for the National Football League this season. Brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the WWE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20040417010511/http://www.wwe.com/news/headlines/1257104|title=Brock Lesnar opts to put WWE career on hold|publisher=WWE (via the Internet Archive|accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref>}}

Lesnar later told a Minnesota [[radio programming|radio show]] that he had three wonderful years in WWE, but had grown unhappy and had always wanted to play pro football, adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have made it in football. In an interview about starting with the NFL, Lesnar made the statement 
{{Quote|This is no load of bull; it's no WWE stunt. I am dead serious about this... I ain't afraid of anything, and I ain't afraid of anybody. I've been an underdog in athletics since I was 5. I got zero college offers for wrestling. Now people say I can't play football, that it's a joke. I say I can. I'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL, if not better... I've always had to fight for everything. I wasn't the best technician in amateur wrestling. But I was strong, had great conditioning, and a hard head. Nobody could break me.

Lesnar played for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], where he created controversy in some games by starting minor fights and got heat from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] for a [[Quarterback sack|sack]] on [[quarterback]] [[Damon Huard]], which drew a big response from the crowd of 6,000.<ref name="chiefs vs vikings"/> Huard was knocked silly and had to go to the sidelines and sit out a few plays.<ref name="chiefs vs vikings">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&id=1853828|title=Brock Watch: Lesnar gets a sack in scrimmage with Chiefs|date=2004-08-09|accessdare=2008-04-04|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> Giving hard hits to quarterbacks in [[scrimmage]]s violates [[unspoken rule|unwritten rules]] of professional football, and the Chiefs were not too happy with him.<ref name="chiefs vs vikings"/> His actions got him featured on ''[[SportsCenter]]'' on more than one occasion.

===Lawsuit with WWE===
Lesnar had previously signed a no-compete clause in order to be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other sports entertainment or mixed martial arts companies before June 2010. Lesnar had anticipated leaving wrestling entirely, but his inability to secure a career in professional football led to him challenging this ruling in court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/12/929079.html|title= Brock taking WWE to court|publisher=SLAM!

On January 14, 2006, Judge Christopher Droney stated that unless WWE gave him a good argument between then and January 25, he would rule in favor of Brock Lesnar, giving him a summary judgment. This would have enabled Lesnar to work anywhere he wanted immediately.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/36937/WWE-News:-Brock,-Tenta,-Oleg,-More.htm | title=WWE News: Brock, Tenta, Oleg, More | publisher=411Mania | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> WWE was later granted a deadline postponement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestling.com/news.php?id=16880/articles/news | title=WWE<U+2019>s Lawsuit Against Lesnar Delayed | publisher=Wrestling Observer (via ProWrestling.com) | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> On April 24, World Wrestling Entertainment announced on their official website, WWE.com, that both parties had mutually come to a settlement and on June 12, a federal judge dismissed Lesnar's lawsuit against WWE after both parties requested for the case to be dismissed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/lesnarwwesettle | title=Brock Lesnar and WWE settle lawsuit | publisher=WWE.com | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>

===New Japan Pro Wrestling=== 
On October 8, 2005, Lesnar won the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|three-way match]] at a [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] show in the [[Tokyo Dome]], which included the then-champion [[Kazuyuki Fujita]] and [[Masahiro Chono]].<ref name="IWGP title">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/htiwgp.html|title=I.W.G.P.

The match was his first pro wrestling match since leaving WWE.<ref name="OWOW"/> Lesnar is one of the few American wrestlers to have held this title.<ref name="IWGP title"/>

On December 6, WWE filed a [[motion (legal)|motion]] for a temporary restraining order to prevent Lesnar from continuing to work with NJPW, but the court did not grant it, and thus Lesnar had two non-title victories against [[Manabu Nakanishi]] and [[Yuji Nagata]].<ref name="WWE-legal">{{cite web |url=http://puroresufan.com/script/show_archives.php?archive=1137877436&subaction=list-archive&|title=New Japan Pro Wrestling news - (25 December 2005 - 20 January 2006)|publisher=Strong Style Sprit|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://puroresufan.com/script/show_archives.php?archive=1135582068&subaction=list-archive&|title=New Japan Pro Wrestling news - (6 December 2005 - 23 December 2005)|publisher=Strong Style Sprit|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> Lesnar successfully defended his championship on January 4, 2006 against former champion [[Shinsuke Nakamura]].<ref name="WWE-legal"/> On January 13, WWE once again filed an injunction against Lesnar to stop him from defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on March 19.

On July 15, 2006, New Japan Pro Wrestling announced that Brock Lesnar had been stripped of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship as he would no longer be returning to defend the title due to "[[visa (document)|visa]] issues." A tournament was held on July 16 to determine the new champion, which was won by [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], the man Lesnar was originally scheduled to face.
