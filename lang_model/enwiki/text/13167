'''Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory''' ('''Fermilab'''), located  in [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] near [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], ([http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Batavia,+IL&ll=41.830497,-88.264546&spn=0.045871,0.047619&t=k&hl=en Google Sat Map]) is a U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] specializing in high-energy [[particle physics]], operated for the Department of Energy by the [http://www.ura-hq.org/ Universities Research Association] (URA). URA is a consortium of 90 leading research oriented universities primarily in the United States, with members also in Canada, Japan, and Italy. It is a part of the [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]].

Fermilab's [[Tevatron]] is a landmark  [[particle accelerator]]; in fact, at six kilometers in circumference, it is the world's highest energy particle accelerator. In [[1995]], both the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]] and [[The D0 Experiment|D0]] (detectors which utilize the Tevatron) experiments announced the discovery of the [[top quark]]. In addition to high energy collider physics, Fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed target experiments and [[neutrino]] experiments, such as [[MiniBooNE]] (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment) and [[MINOS]] (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search).  The MiniBooNE detector is a 40-foot (12-meter) diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year.  The MINOS experiment uses Fermilab's [[NuMI]] (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels 735km through the Earth to the [[Soudan Mine]] in [[Minnesota]].

In the public realm, Fermilab is host to many [http://www.fnal.gov/culture/culture.shtml cultural events], not only public science lectures and symposiums, but classical and contemporary music concerts and arts galleries, when the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] permits.  Currently the site is open to all visitors from dawn to dusk who present valid [[photo identification]].

A small herd of [http://www-ed.fnal.gov/entry_exhibits/bison/bison_title.html American bison], started at the lab's founding, lives on the grounds symbolizing Fermilab's presence on the frontier of physics and its connection to the American prairie.  Some fearful locals believed at first that the bison were introduced in order to serve as an alarm if and when radiation at the laboratory reached dangerous levels, but they were assured that this claim had no merits by Fermilab.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Weston68 b.jpg|thumb|1968 notice of the NAL site]] 
[[Image:Tevatron.jpg|thumb|Collider Detector at Fermilab ([[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]]) with additional equipment]]
'''Weston, Illinois''' was a community next to [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] voted out of existence by its village board in [[1966]] to provide a site for Fermilab.

The laboratory was founded in [[1967]] as the '''National Accelerator Laboratory''', it was renamed in honor of [[Enrico Fermi]] in [[1974]]. 

The lab's first director was [[Robert Rathbun Wilson]].  Many of the unique sculptures on the site are of his creation.  He is attributed as being responsible for it being finished ahead of time and under budget.  The [http://history.fnal.gov/highrise.html high rise laboratory building] located on the site, the unique shape of which has become the symbol for Fermilab, is named in his honor, and is the center of activity on the campus.

After Dr. Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, [[Leon Lederman|Dr. Leon M. Lederman]] took on the job.  It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron accelerator, an accelerator capable of colliding a [[proton]] and an [[antiproton]] at a combined energy of 2 [[TeV]].  Dr. Lederman stepped down in 1988 and remains Director Emeritus.  The on-site science education center was named in his honor.

From 1988 to 1998, the lab was run by [http://history.fnal.gov/peoples.html Dr. John Peoples]. From that time until June 30, 2005, the lab was run by [http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/profiles/witherell.html Michael S. Witherell]. On November 19, 2004 [[Piermaria Oddone]], formerly of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in California, was announced as Fermilab's newest Director.  Oddone began his term as director July 1, 2005.

Fermilab is one of the potential sites for the proposed [[International Linear Collider]].

==Accelerators==
[[Image:Fermi_Rings.gif|thumb|Fermilab's Accelerator Rings]]
The first stage in the acceleration process takes place in the [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]]. It involves taking [[hydrogen]] gas and turning it into H<sup>-</sup> ions by introducing it into a container lined with [[caesium]]. A magnetic field is applied by the Cockcroft-Walton generator, and the ions are accelerated out of the container. The next step is the [[linear accelerator]] (or Linac), which accelerates the particles to 400 million electron volts (MeV), or about 70% of the [[speed of light]]. Right before entering the next accelerator, the H<sup>-</sup> ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H<sup>+</sup> ions ([[proton]]s). The next step is the booster ring. The booster ring is a circular accelerator that uses magnets to bend beams of protons in a circular path. The protons coming from the Linac travel around the Booster about 20,000 times so that they repeatedly experience electric fields. With each revolution the protons pick up more energy, leaving the Booster with 8 billion electron volts (GeV). Next comes the Main Injector. The Main Injector, completed in 1999, has become Fermilab's "particle switchyard" with three functions: it accelerates protons, it delivers protons for antiproton production, and it accelerates antiprotons coming from the [[Antiproton]] Source. The final accelerator is the [[Tevatron]]. The four-mile-long Tevatron with its [[superconductivity|superconducting]] magnets is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. Traveling at almost the speed of light, protons and antiprotons circle the Tevatron in opposite directions. Physicists co-ordinate the beams so that they collide at the centers of two 5,000-ton detectors [[d0 experiment|DZero]] and [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]] inside the Tevatron tunnel at energies of 2 trillion electron volts (TeV), revealing the conditions of matter in the early universe and its structure at the smallest scale.

==Architecture==
[[Image:archimedes_spiral_fermi.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Archimedean Spiral]] construction.]]
Dr. Wilson maintained an influence over design and construction such that the aesthetic complexion of the site would not be diluted by a collection of concrete block buildings. The design of the administrative building (Wilson Hall) harkens back to [[Cath<U+00E9>drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais|St. Pierre cathedral]] in Beauvais, France, and several of the buildings and sculptures within the Fermilab reservation represent various mathematical constructs as part of their structure. 

The [[Archimedean Spiral]] is the defining shape of several [[pumping station]]s as well as the building housing the MINOS experiment. The reflecting pond at Wilson Hall also showcases a 32-foot tall [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] obelisk, designed by Dr. Wilson. Some of the high voltage [[transmission lines]] carrying power through the laboratory's land are built to echo the Greek letter [[pi|<U+03C0>]]. One can also find structural examples of the [[DNA]] double-helix spiral and a nod to the [[geodesic sphere]].

Several large pieces of sculpture found on Fermilab and designed by Wilson include [[Tractricious]], a free-standing arrangement of steel tubes near the Industrial Complex constructed from parts and materials recycled from the Tevatron collider; the soaring [[Broken Symmetry]] greets those entering the campus via the Pine Street entrance. Crowning the [[Robert F. Ramsey|Ramsey Auditorium]] is a representation of the [[Mobius Strip]] with a diameter of more than eight feet.

==Working at Fermilab==
[[Image:Fermilab Main Control Room Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|Main Control room.]]
Fermilab won the 2006 Golden Family Award from the Society of Women Engineers. Fermilab offers equal employment and women represent more than 40% of the work force and most of them are spouses or daughters of scientists and physicists. Golden Family Award stated -- "For outstanding support of family issues your facilities, your benefits, your programs, and your approach encourage balance for employees and their families" <ref>{{cite web

==The Future==
As of 2008, the Tevatron will no longer be the highest energy collider in the world. In 2007 [[CERN]] plans to make its [[Large Hadron Collider]] operational at a lower energy than the Tevatron (0.45 TeV per beam, vs. 0.98), with full energy to follow the next spring. This particle accelerator will have a 27km circumference, and will accelerate particles to a total collision energy of 14 TeV, 7 times the energy at Fermilab. Although Fermilab will continue to play an important role in the future of physics, as of 2008 it will have lost its prestigious title of the world's highest energy collider.

On November 1, 2006, the Department of Energy announced that the Fermi Research Alliance, LLC (FRA) will manage Fermilab for five years starting January 1, 2007. The FRA is a partnership between the Universities Research Association (URA) and the [[University of Chicago]]. Based on its performance, the FRA may be entitled to renew this contract without competition for up to 20 years. <ref>{{cite web

==Current Financial Situation==
The Fermilab budget has been continuously below inflation over the last several years, and Fermilab failed to attract more funding sources and this resulted in reducing staff levels (by 100 in 2005).<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The new director of the lab and the new management are working hard to bring the [[International Linear Collider]] (ILC) to Fermilab. If Fermilab is successful in getting the ILC then there would be a large rise in the budget and Fermilab may double its work force. Failure to get the ILC at Fermilab will have a great impact on running Fermilab in the next decade.

===One month shutdown of Fermilab due to funding===
In a Message from Director posted on January 5th 2007 <ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/FromOddone.pdf
| title = P. ODDONE E-MAIL RESPONSE TO RAY ORBACH
| accessdate = 2006-01-06

| year = 2006
}}</ref>, the director stated the following: 

"The fiscal situation at Fermilab is extremely constrained. The surgery that would enable the laboratory to fit an FY06 funding level and continue to operate the program would be a furlough of one month. We would shut down the whole laboratory for one month except for essential personnel to keep the site orderly and safe and the computers running."

In the same message, the director stated the following:

"The laboratory has no funded projects, either on-going or new, so there are no significant capital expenses that could be postponed in order to avoid a furlough...Restoration of these cuts would permit at least some small new projects at the end of the decade when the Tevatron is shutdown for good."
