'''New York State Route 317''' (also known as '''NY 317''') is a [[state highway]] located entirely within the town of [[Elbridge (town), New York|Elbridge]] in [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], [[New York]]. It begins at [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]] in the village of [[Elbridge (village), New York|Elbridge]] and ends {{convert|3.12|mi|km|lk=on}} to the north at [[New York State Route 31|NY 31]] in the village of  [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]]. The route parallels [[Skaneateles Creek]] for its entire length.

Route 317 was assigned in [[2003]], when '''New York State Route 31C''' was turned over to the county. Route 31C was flooded that year and became unpassable. That is now county and town maintained. Route 317 was originally assigned in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] before being decommissioned in [[1980]].

==Route description==
NY 317 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]] in [[Elbridge (village), New York|Elbridge]], [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]. The route heads north, following Jordan Road out of the village limits and into the [[Elbridge (village), New York|town of the same name]]. Within the town of Elbridge, NY 317 parallels both the [[Skaneateles Creek]] (loosely following the eastern bank) and the discontinuous Valley Drive on the west bank of the waterway. Shortly after intersecting Whiting Road (County Route 183), NY 317 enters the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] and becomes Elbridge Street.<ref name="map07">{{cite map|title=Finger Lakes map|date=2007|publisher=[[American Automobile Association]]|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>

Inside Jordan, NY 317 heads north, then west to an intersection with Valley Drive, the former routing of [[New York State Route 31C|NY 31C]] south of Jordan. From Valley Drive north to NY 31, the alignments of old 31C and modern 317 are identical.<ref name="map07"/>

Past Valley Drive, NY 317 continues westward across Skaneateles Creek to an intersection with South Main Street. At South Main, NY 317 turns northward, following South and North Main Streets through the remainder of the village to [[New York State Route 31|NY 31]], where both North Main and NY 317 terminate.<ref name="map07"/>

==History==
Valley Drive, a narrow, winding road along the western bank of [[Skaneateles Creek]] in the town of [[Elbridge (town), New York|Elbridge]], was originally an unnumbered connector between the villages of [[Elbridge (village), New York|Elbridge]] (where it met [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]]) and [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] (where it intersected [[New York State Route 31|NY 31]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_008.html|title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (western New York)|year=1926|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> The road was first signed as a [[state highway]] in the late 1920s when it was designated as '''New York State Route 31A'''. The designation was short-lived, however, as the route would become the northernmost portion of [[New York State Route 41|NY 41]] in the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]].<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> By 1938, NY 41 was truncated to its present northern terminus in [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]] and replaced with '''New York State Route 31C''' from Jordan to Elbridge.<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1938/39 edition, (W.A. Thibodeau, 1938).</ref>

NY 31C remained unchanged until 2002 when part of Valley Drive was washed out by flooding from the nearby creek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/ind/030_039.htm#031c|title=New York Routes - New York State Route 31C|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> A bill was introduced in the [[New York State Legislature]] shortly afterward that would turn maintenance of '''Onondaga County Route&nbsp;105''', an alternate route between Jordan and Elbridge on the opposite bank of Skaneateles Creek, over to the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] and give Valley Drive to the town of Elbridge and the villages of Jordan and Elbridge. The bill was passed by the [[New York State Senate]] on [[April 30]], [[2002]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senatordefrancisco.org/press_archive_story.asp?id=4248 |title=Senate Passes DeFrancisco Bill For Exchange Of Ownership And Maintenance Of Selected Elbridge Roads And Bridges |date=[[2002-04-30]] |accessdate=2008-01-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070320183920/http://www.senatordefrancisco.org/press_archive_story.asp?id=4248|archivedate=2007-03-20}}</ref> and was subsequently passed by the [[New York State Assembly]]. It was signed into law on [[April 1]], [[2003]],<ref name=law>{{cite web|author=[[New York State Legislature]]|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Highway Law, Article 12, Section 341|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> at which time NY 31C was effectively renumbered to NY 317<ref name=2004log>{{cite web|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/tour_route_0.pdf|title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Bicycle Routes in New York State|author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]|date=October 2004|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> and rerouted south of the intersection of Valley Drive and Elbridge Street in Jordan to follow the former CR 105 to Elbridge. Currently, Valley Drive is now two separate dead end streets as the washed-out section was never repaired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=valley+drive,+elbridge,+ny&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=24.952617,58.710937&ie=UTF8&ll=43.049384,-76.456261&spn=0.044784,0.11467&z=14&om=0 |title=Valley Drive, Elbridge, NY - Google Maps| accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref>

NY 317's original alignment was located in [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]], extending from [[New York State Route 40|NY 40]] in [[Troy, New York|Troy]] to [[New York State Route 142|NY 142]] in [[Brunswick, New York|Brunswick]] on what is now '''Albany County Route&nbsp;144'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/ind/310_319.htm#317|title=New York Routes - New York State Route 317|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref>
