"'''Something Old, Something New'''" is the tenth episode of the [[The Hills (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[The Hills]]''. It originally aired on [[MTV]] on May 31, 2009. In the episode, [[Heidi Montag]] and [[Spencer Pratt]] prepare for their upcoming wedding, while [[Lauren Conrad]] and [[Lo Bosworth]] move out of their house. After much deliberation, Conrad decides to attend the nuptials, where she reconciles with Montag after being estranged with one another since the third season. It is the final episode in which Conrad appears, and also marks the entrance of her replacement [[Kristin Cavallari]].

"Something Old, Something New" was produced by [[Adam DiVello]], [[Liz Gateley]], Kristofer Lindquist, Sara Mast, and Sean Travis. After the season was retroactively divided into Part I and Part II, respectively separating installments featuring Conrad and Cavallari, the episode became the conclusion of Part I. Additionally, it is the second episode in the series' history with a one-hour running time, the first being "Paris Changes Everything" in the third season.

"Something Old, Something New" was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt that Cavallari's introduction overshadowed Conrad's departure. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was watched by 2.7 million viewers in its original airing. The episode was released on [[DVD]] on October 6, 2009, packaged with the remainder of Part I of the fifth season.

==Plot==
Lauren and [[Lo Bosworth|Lo]] decide to host a farewell party as they prepare to move out of their house. As wedding preparations continue, [[Stephanie Pratt|Stephanie]] becomes upset after learning that Heidi has chosen her sister [[Holly Montag|Holly]] as her [[Bridesmaid|maid-of-honor]]. During the bridal shower, Stephanie assumes the responsibilities after she becomes increasingly displeased with Holly's poor performance. After she makes amends with [[Spencer Pratt|Spencer]], Darlene gives him her blessing for the nuptials. While out for dinner, [[Brody Jenner|Brody]] tries to convince Lauren to attend the wedding, knowing that Heidi would appreciate her presence. In a later outing, Spencer tells Brody of his couples' therapy sessions with Heidi, but is displeased that he is not taken seriously. At the fashion public relations firm People's Revolution, Lauren tells [[Kelly Cutrone|Kelly]] that she will be leaving the company, which Kelly advocates as a smart decision that will help her to determine her next career endeavors.<ref name="Synopsis">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/the_hills/season_5/episode.jhtml?episodeID=155104|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110223085429/http://www.mtv.com/shows/the_hills/season_5/episode.jhtml?episodeID=155104|title=The Hills (Season 5) Ep. 510: Something Old, Something New|publisher=MTV.

After Spencer explains that her behavior was inappropriate, Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant.

After leaving Heidi, Lauren appears displeased after Lo tells her that Kristin is seated across from them. After the wedding has finished, Kristin tells Lo that she needs help finding a boyfriend, and to [[Audrina Patridge|Audrina]]'s disapproval, adds that Justin seems to be a "stand up guy".

==Reception and release==
"Something Old, Something New" was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, many of whom were ambivalent towards Conrad's departure and Cavallari's introduction. Emma Rosenblum from ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' was pleased with Conrad's exit, commenting that she  was emotional watching her "moving on and distancing herself from the follies of her overexposed youth". However, she opined that Cavallari's appearance at the wedding "does not bode well for the future of ''The Hills''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2009/06/hills_finale.html|title=Hills Finale: Good-bye, Lauren; Hello, Marriage|author=Emma Rosenblum|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media LLC|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> A writer for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the reconciliation between Conrad and Montag an "ideal end" to the series, and noted Cavallari's addition as a "questionable choice".
