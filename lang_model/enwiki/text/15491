{{History of Israel}}

The '''Kingdom of Israel''' ({{Hebrew Name|<U+05DE><U+05B7><U+05DE><U+05B0><U+05DC><U+05B6><U+05DB><U+05B6><U+05EA> <U+05D9><U+05B4><U+05E9><U+05B0><U+05C2><U+05E8><U+05B8><U+05D0><U+05B5><U+05DC>|Mamlekhet Yisra'el|Maml<U+00E9><U+1E35>e<U+1E6F> Yi<U+015B>r<U+0101><U+02BC><U+0113>l}}) was, according to the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]], one of  two successor states to the former [[United Monarchy]] (also often called the 'Kingdom of Israel'). It existed roughly from the 930s [[BCE]] until about the 720s BCE, when the kingdom was conquered by the [[Assyria|Assyrian Empire]]. The major cities of the kingdom were [[Shechem]], [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]], and Shomron ([[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]).

Historians often refer to ancient Israel as the Northern Kingdom or the Kingdom of Samaria to differentiate it from the Southern [[Kingdom of Judah]].

Modern scholarship, including [[textual criticism]] and [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]], has challenged the biblical account that the northern kingdom of Israel broke off from a united monarchy with the southern kingdom of Judah, suggesting instead that the northern civilization of Israel developed independently of Judah, a comparatively small and rural area, and that it first reached the political, economic, military and architectural sophistication of a kingdom under the Omride dynasty around 884 BCE.<ref name=Kuhrtp438>{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=Amiele|title=The Ancient Near East|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415167628|page=438}}</ref><ref>Finkelstein, Israel, and Silberman, Neil Asher, ''The Bible Unearthed : Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', pages 169-195, Simon & Schuster, 2002. ISBN 0-684-86912-8</ref><ref>http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml</ref>

==Name==
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Kingdom of Israel has been referred to as "[[House of Joseph]]".<ref name="Zechariah 10:6">*[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%2010:6;&version=49; Zechariah 10:6]</ref><ref name="2Samuel 2:10">*[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=10&chapter=2&verse=10&version=31&context=verse II Samuel 2:10]</ref> It is also frequently referenced (particularly in poetry) as [[Ephraim and Judah|Ephraim]], the tribe whose territory housed the capital cities and the royal families. It has also been referred to as "Israel in Samaria".<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2022:51;&version=9; 1 Kings 22:51] and many subsequent passages</ref>

==Territory==
The territory of the Kingdom of Israel comprised the territories of the tribes of [[tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], [[tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] and [[tribe of Gad|Gad]].

Its capital was [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] according to the [[Book of Isaiah]]. <!-- [http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/Kings.html] [http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/Judah.html] -->

==Biblical narrative==

===United Monarchy===
{{Main|Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)}}

The united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] is said to have existed from about 1030 to about 930 BCE. It was a union of all the twelve [[Israelite]] tribes living in the area that presently approximates [[modern Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]].

===Division===

After the death of [[Solomon]] in about 931 BCE, all the Israelite tribes except for [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] (called the ten northern tribes) refused to accept [[Rehoboam]], the son and successor of Solomon, as their king.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:17-22|NIV}}</ref> The rebellion against Rehoboam arose after he refused to lighten the burden of [[tax]]ation and services that his father had imposed on his subjects.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:4|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:14|NIV}}</ref>

[[Jeroboam]], who was not of the Davidic line, was sent for from [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] by the malcontents.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:2-3|NIV}}</ref> The [[Tribe of Ephraim]] and all Israel raised the old cry, "Every man to his tents, O Israel".<ref>{{Bibleverse||2Samuel|20:1|NIV}}</ref> Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:1-18|NIV}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|10|NIV}}</ref> and in 930 BCE (some date it in 920 BCE), Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at [[Shechem]]. After the revolt at [[Shechem]] at first only the [[tribe of Judah]] remained loyal to the [[Davidic line|house of David]]. But very soon after the [[tribe of Benjamin]] joined Judah. The northern kingdom continued to be called the Kingdom of Israel or Israel, while the southern kingdom was called the kingdom of Judah.  2 Chronicles 15:9<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|NIV}}</ref> also says that members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] fled to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]].

Both [[Eusebius]] and [[Josephus]] place the division in 997 BCE - lunar dates of Venus can be mistaken as 64 years later (c. 930 BCE). (Crossing of sun over Mars as [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tamuz]] would be 10 July 997 BCE.)

[[Shechem]] was the first capital of the Kingdom of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:25|NIV}}</ref>  Afterwards it was [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|14:17|NIV}}</ref>  King [[Omri]] built his capital in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] (1 Kings 16:24), which continued as such until the destruction of the Kingdom by the [[Assyria]]ns ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|17:5|NIV}}). During the three-year siege of Samaria by the Assyrians, [[Shalmaneser V]] died and was succeeded by [[Sargon II of Assyria]], who himself records the capture of that city thus: "Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away"  into Assyria. Thus, around 720 BCE, after two centuries, the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end.

Today, among archaeologists, Samaria is one of the most universally accepted archaeological sites from the biblical period<ref>See Yohanan Aharoni, et al., The Macmillan Bible Atlas, Macmillan Publishing: New York, 1993, p. 94.; and Amihai Mazar, The Archaeology of the Land of the Bible: 10,000 <U+2013> 586 B.C.E, New York: Doubleday, 1992, p. 404, see Pp. 406-410 for discussion of archaeological significance of Shomron ([[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]) under Omride Dynasty.</ref> At around 850 BCE, the [[Mesha Stele]], written in [[Phoenician alphabet|Old Hebrew alphabet]], records a victory of King [[Mesha]] of Moab against king [[Omri]] of Israel and his son [[Ahab]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|3|HE}}</ref>

===Relations between the kingdoms===
For the first sixty years, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over the northern kingdom, and there was perpetual war between them. For the following eighty years, there was no open war between them, and, for the most part, they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against [[Damascus]].

The conflict between Israel and Judah was resolved when [[Jehoshaphat]], King of Judah, allied himself with the house of [[Ahab]] through marriage. Later, Jehosophat's son and successor, [[Jehoram of Judah]], married Ahab's daughter [[Athaliah]], cementing the alliance. However, the sons of Ahab were slaughtered by [[Jehu]] following his [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] around 840 BCE.

===Destruction of the kingdom===
[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|right|thumb|Deportation of the Northern Kingdom by the [[Assyrian Empire]]]]
{{main|Assyrian captivity of Israel}}

In c. 732 BCE, [[Pekah]] of Israel allied with [[Rezin]], king of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], threatened [[Jerusalem]], and [[Ahaz]], [[king of Judah]], appealed to [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], the king of [[Assyria]], for help. After Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:7-9|NIV}}</ref> Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aram<ref name=Grabbe>Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'' (New York: T&T Clark, 2007): 134</ref> and territory of the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in Gilead including the desert outposts of [[Jetur]], [[Naphish]] and [[Nodab]]. People from these tribes including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur River]] system. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|NIV}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|NIV}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.

Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom until around 720 BCE, when it was again invaded by [[Assyria]] and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, becoming known as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]], leaving only the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was "absorbed" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]] and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]] who lived among them of the original [[Israelites]] nation in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, in their book [[The Bible Unearthed]], authors [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] estimate that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] and [[Sargon II]].<ref>Finkelstein & Silberman 2001, [[The Bible Unearthed]] p. 221.</ref> Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water ([[Siloam]]) to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].

The remainder of the northern kingdom was conquered by [[Sargon II]], who captured the capital city [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] in the territory of Ephraim. He took 27,290 people captive from the city of Samaria resettling some with the Israelites in the Khabur region and the rest in the land of the [[Medes]] thus establishing Hebrew communities in [[Ecbatana]] and [[Rages]].

The [[Book of Tobit]] additionally records that Sargon had taken other captives from the northern kingdom to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, in particular Tobit from the town of Thisbe in Naphtali.

In medieval Rabbinic fable the concept of the ten tribes who were taken away from the House of David (who continued the rule of the southern kingdom of Judah) becomes confounded with accounts of the Assyrian deportations leading to the myth of the "Ten Lost Tribes". The recorded history differs from this fable: No record exists of the Assyrians having exiled people from Dan, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun or western Manasseh. Descriptions of the deportation of people from [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in [[Gilead]], [[Ephraim]] and Naphtali indicate that only a portion of these tribes were deported and the places to which they were deported are known locations given in the accounts. The deported communities are mentioned as still existing at the time of the composition of the books of Kings and Chronicles and did not disappear by assimilation. 2 Chronicles 30:1-11<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-18|NIV}}</ref> explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians in particular people of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]] and [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].

===Kingdom of Judah===
{{Main|Kingdom of Judah}}

The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].

==Culture==

===Religion===
The religious climate of the Kingdom of Israel appears to have followed two major trends.  The first, that of [[YHWH]], and the second the cult of [[Baal]] as detailed in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and in the [[Baal cycle]] discovered at [[Ugarit]].

It is recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]] that [[Jeroboam]] built two places of worship, one at Bethel and one at far northern Dan, to be an alternative to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. He did not want the people of his kingdom to have religious ties to [[Jerusalem]], the capital city of the rival [[Kingdom of Judah]]. He erected golden bulls at the entrance to the Temples to represent the national god.<ref name="teldan.wordpress.com">http://teldan.wordpress.com/israelite-temple/</ref> The Hebrew Bible, written from the perspective of scribes in Jerusalem, referred to these acts as the way of Jeroboam or the errors of Jeroboam.<ref name="teldan.wordpress.com"/>({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|12:26-29|HE}})

Ahab allowed the cult worship of [[Baal]] to become an acceptable religion of the kingdom. His wife [[Jezebel]] was a devotee to Baal worship. ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|16:31|HE}})

===Prophets===
*[[Elijah]], opponent of religious inventions under Ahab and Jezebel
*[[Elisha]], chosen successor of Elijah
*[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]]
*[[Hosea]]
*[[Jonah]]
*[[Nahum]]

His brother [[Sargon II]] (722&ndash;705 BCE) completed the siege with success in 722. Some of the population of the Northern Kingdom was exiled to other parts of the Assyrian Empire and new population groups were resettled in the new Assyrian province of Samaria. A small group of people fled south to take refuge in Judah.</ref> Death: King Shalmanser attacked and captured Samaria. He charged Hoshea of treason and he put him in prison, then, he deported the Israelites to Assyria.
