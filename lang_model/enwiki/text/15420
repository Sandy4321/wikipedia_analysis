[[Image:CIA New HQ Entrance.jpg|right|thumb|The entrance of the CIA [[Headquarter]]s]]
The '''Central Intelligence Agency''' ('''CIA''') is a civilian [[intelligence agency]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. 

It is an independent U.S. Government agency responsible for providing [[national security]] [[intelligence]] to senior U.S. [[policymakers]].

It is the successor of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) formed, during World War II, to coordinate [[espionage]] activities between the branches of the US military services. The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA, affording it "no police or law enforcement functions, either at home or abroad." One year later this mandate was expanded to include <U+201C>sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures<U+2026>. Subversion (and) assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberation movements, and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world<U+201D> <ref name=Kinzer>{{citation
|title =All the Shah<U+2019>s men
| first = Stephen  | last = Kinzer
| date = 2008
}}</ref>

Today, the CIA's primary function is [[Intelligence collection management|collecting]], and [[Intelligence analysis management|analyzing]] information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals which it uses to advise public policymakers.  The agency conducts [[covert operations]], [[paramilitary]] actions and exerts foreign political influence through its [[Special Activities Division]].  Prior to December 2004, the CIA was literally the central intelligence organization for the US government, charged with coordinating and overseeing not only its own activities, but also the activities of the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] as a whole. The [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act|Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]] created the office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide functions that had previously been the CIA's. The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the [[Intelligence cycle management|intelligence cycle]]. Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies, and preparation of briefings for the president.

2004 was a critical year in the history of the CIA, as there is a marked difference between the agency as it was during the period that it bore IC-wide responsibilities, and the agency as it is today, given its present set of responsibilities. The IC still has internal politics,<ref name=Theoharis2007>{{cite book

|publisher=Ivan R. Dee
|isbn=1-56663-697-3
}}</ref> although an increasing number of interagency "centers", as well as the [[Intellipedia]] information sharing mechanism, are hoped to improve cooperation between each member.

The current CIA still has a number of functions in common with other countries' intelligence agencies; see [[#Relationship with other sources of intelligence|relationships with foreign intelligence agencies]]. The CIA's headquarters is in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], a few miles west of [[Washington, D.C.]] along the Potomac River.

Sometimes, the CIA is referred to euphemistically in government and military parlance as '''Other Government Agencies''' ('''OGA'''), particularly when its operations in a particular area are an [[open secret]].<ref>{{cite web

==Organization==
{{Main|Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency}}
In its present form, the CIA has an executive office and several agency-wide functions, and four major directorates:
:*The '''Directorate of Intelligence''', responsible for all-source intelligence research and analysis
:*The '''[[National Clandestine Service]]''', formerly the Directorate of Operations, which does clandestine intelligence collection and covert action
:*The '''Directorate of Support'''
:*The '''Directorate of Science and Technology'''

===Budget===
The overall U.S. intelligence budget has been considered classified until recently. There have been numerous attempts to get general information<ref name=Aftergood2002budget>{{citation
 | plaintiff=Steven Aftergood
 | defendant=Central Intelligence Agency

===Executive Office===
The [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] (D/CIA) reports directly to the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI); in practice, he deals with the DNI, Congress (usually via the [[CIA Office of Congressional Affairs|OCA]]), and the [[White House]], while the Deputy Director is the internal executive. The CIA has varying amounts of Congressional oversight, although that is principally a guidance role.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The CIA Executive Office also facilitates CIA<U+2019>s support of the military by providing the military with information it gathers, receiving information from military intelligence organizations, and cooperating on field activities. Two senior executives have responsibility, one CIA-wide and one for the National Clandestine Service. The Associate Director for Military Support, a senior military officer, manages the relationship between CIA and the [[Unified Combatant Command]]s, who produce regional/operational intelligence and consume national intelligence; he is assisted by the Office of Military Affairs in providing support to all branches of the military.<ref name = OMA> {{cite web

The '''Office of Policy Support''' customizes Directorate of Intelligence analysis and presents it to a wide variety of policy, law enforcement, military, and foreign liaison recipients.

===National Clandestine Service===
{{Main|National Clandestine Service}}
In 2004, the CIA was given charge of all US human intelligence, which many consider the core of the agency.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} As such, the '''National Clandestine Service''' (NCS; formerly the Directorate of Operations) is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence, mainly from clandestine HUMINT sources, and covert action. The new name reflects its having absorbed some Department of Defense HUMINT assets. The NCS was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence, philosophy and budget between the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the CIA. The Department of Defense had organized the Defense HUMINT Service,<ref name=GWUEBB46>{{citation

===Directorate of Science and Technology===
{{Main|Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology|l1=Directorate of Science & Technology}}
The Directorate of Science & Technology was established to research, create, and manage technical collection disciplines and equipment. Many of its innovations were transferred to other intelligence organizations, or, as they became more overt, to the military services.

For example, the development of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft was done in cooperation with the [[United States Air Force]]. The U-2's original mission was clandestine [[IMINT|imagery intelligence]] over denied areas such as the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}  It was subsequently provided with [[signals intelligence]] and [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence|measurement and signature intelligence]] capabilities, and is now operated by the Air Force.

Imagery intelligence collected by the U-2 and reconnaissance satellites was analyzed by a DS&T organization called the National Photointerpretation Center (NPIC), which had analysts from both the CIA and the military services. Subsequently, NPIC was transferred to the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA).

The CIA has always shown a strong interest in how to use advances in technology to enhance its effectiveness This interest has historically had two primary goals:
:#harnessing techniques for its own use
:#countering any new intelligence technologies the Soviets might develop.<ref>{{cite web

In 1999, the CIA created the venture capital firm [[In-Q-Tel]] to help fund and develop technologies of interest to the agency.<ref>{{cite web

| publisher=Central Intelligence Agency, with permission from the Defense Intelligence Journal
}}</ref>  It has long been the IC practice to contract for major development, such as reconnaissance aircraft and satellites.

===Directorate of Support===
{{Main|Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Support|Directorate of Support}}
The Directorate of Support has many traditional organizational administrative functions, such as personnel, security, communications, and financial operations, but in a manner consistent with the needs of highly sensitive operations. Significant units include
:* The '''Office of Security'''
:* The '''Office of Communications'''
:* The '''Office of Information Technology'''

====Training====
The '''Office of Training''' begins with the Junior Officer Training program for new employees, but it also conducts courses in a wide range of specialized professional disciplines. So that the initial course might be taken by employees who had not received final security clearance and thus were not permitted unescorted access to the Headquarters building, a good deal of basic training has been given at office buildings in the urban areas of Arlington, Virginia.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

For a later stage of training of student operations officers, there is at least one classified training area at Camp Peary, Virginia, near Williamsburg. Students are selected, and their progress evaluated, in ways derived from the OSS, published as the book ''Assessment of Men, Selection of Personnel for the office of Strategic Services''.<ref name=AOM>{{citation

==Relationship with other sources of intelligence==
{{Refimprovesect|date=June 2009}}

The CIA acts as the primary American HUMINT, HUMan INTelligence, and general analytic agency, under the Director of National Intelligence, who directs or coordinates the 16 member organizations of the United States Intelligence Community. In addition, it obtains information from other U.S. government intelligence agencies, commercial information sources, and foreign intelligence services.

===Other U.S. intelligence agencies===
A number of intelligence organizations are fully or partially under the budgetary control of the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] or other cabinet officers such as the [[United States Attorney General]].

As do other analytic members of the U.S. intelligence community, such as the Department of State's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] and the analytic division of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), CIA's raw input includes imagery intelligence (IMINT) collected by the air and space systems of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), processed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), signals intelligence (SIGINT) of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) from the DIA MASINT center.

===Open Source Intelligence===
Until the 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community, one of the "services of common concern" that CIA provided was [[Open Source Intelligence]] from the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS).<ref>{{cite web

As part of its mandate to gather intelligence, CIA is looking increasingly online for information, and has become a major consumer of social media. "We're looking at YouTube, which carries some unique and honest-to-goodness intelligence," said Doug Naquin, director of the DNI [[Open Source Center]] (OSC) at CIA. "We're looking at chat rooms and things that didn't exist five years ago, and trying to stay ahead."<ref>{{cite web

According to investigative journalist [[Tim Shorrock]]:
:"...what we have today with the intelligence business is something far more systemic: senior officials leaving their national security and counterterrorism jobs for positions where they are basically doing the same jobs they once held at the CIA, the NSA and other agencies&nbsp;<U+2014> but for double or triple the salary, and for profit. It's a privatization of the highest order, in which our collective memory and experience in intelligence&nbsp;<U+2014> our crown jewels of spying, so to speak&nbsp;<U+2014> are owned by corporate America.

</blockquote>

Part of the contracting problem comes from Congressional restrictions on the number of employees in the IC. According to Hillhouse, this resulted in 70% of the de facto workforce of the CIA's National Clandestine Service being made up of contractors.  "After years of contributing to the increasing reliance upon contractors, Congress is now providing a framework for the conversion of contractors into federal government employees--more or less."<ref name=Hillhouse2007-12-18 />

As with most government agencies, building equipment often is contracted. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), responsible for the development and operation of airborne and spaceborne sensors, long was a joint operation of the CIA and the United States Department of Defense. NRO had been significantly involved in the design of such sensors, but the NRO, then under DCI authority, contracted more of the design that had been their tradition, and to a contractor without extensive reconnaissance experience, [[Boeing]]. The next-generation satellite [[Future Imagery Architecture]] project, which missed objectives after $4 billion in cost overruns, was the result of this contract.<ref name=AWST2005-03-20>{{citation

===Foreign intelligence services===
Many intelligence services cooperate. There may even be a deniable communications channel with ostensibly hostile nations.

The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the United Kingdom's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS), the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki)]] (SVR), the French foreign intelligence service [[Directorate-General for External Security|Direction G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale de la S<U+00E9>curit<U+00E9> Ext<U+00E9>rieure]] (DGSE) and Israel's [[Mossad]]. While the preceding agencies both collect and analyze information, some like the US State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] are purely analytical agencies. See [[List of intelligence agencies]].

The closest links of the US IC to other foreign intelligence agencies are to Anglophone countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. There is a special communications marking that signals that intelligence-related messages can be shared with these four countries.<ref name=DMS1999-03-19> {{citation

}}</ref> An indication of the United States' close operational cooperation is the creation of a new message distribution label within the main US military communications network. Previously, the marking of NOFORN (i.e., No Foreign Nationals) required the originator to specify which, if any, non-US countries could receive the information. A new handling caveat, USA/AUS/CAN/GBR/NZL ''Eyes Only'', used primarily on intelligence messages, gives an easier way to indicate that the material can be shared with Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand.

==Organizational history==
{{See also|Director of Central Intelligence|Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action}}

The Central Intelligence Agency was created by Congress with the passage of the [[National Security Act of 1947]], signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]]. It is the descendant of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) of World War II, which was dissolved in October 1945 and its functions transferred to the State and War Departments. Eleven months earlier, in 1944, [[William Joseph Donovan|William J. Donovan]], the OSS's creator, proposed to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to create a new organization directly supervised by the President: "which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies."<ref name=CIAfact>{{cite book

===Immediate predecessors, 1946&ndash;47===
The [[Office of Strategic Services]], which was the first independent US intelligence agency, created for World War II, was broken up shortly after the end of the war, by President Harry S. Truman, on September 20, 1945 when he signed an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] which made the breakup 'official' as of October 1, 1945. The rapid reorganizations that followed reflected the routine sort of bureaucratic competition for resources, but also trying to deal with the proper relationships of clandestine intelligence collection and covert action (i.e., paramilitary and psychological operations).{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} In October 1945, the functions of the OSS were split between the Departments of State and War:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) (not uniquely for former OSS)
| War Department, Army General Staff
| Staff officers from Operational Groups, [[Operation Jedburgh]], Morale Operations (black propaganda)
|}
This division lasted only a few months. Despite opposition from the military establishment, the [[United States Department of State]] and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),<ref name=CIAfact /> President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) in January 1946 which was the direct predecessor to the CIA.<ref>{{cite web

The National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects, June 18, 1948 (NSC 10/2) further gave the CIA the authority to carry out covert operations "against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and conducted that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons."<ref name="NSC10/2">{{cite web

In 1949, the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] ([[Public law]] 81-110) authorized the agency to use confidential fiscal and administrative procedures, and exempting it from most of the usual limitations on the use of Federal funds. It also exempted the CIA from having to disclose its "organization, functions, officials, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed." It also created the program "PL-110", to handle defectors and other "essential aliens" who fall outside normal immigration procedures, as well as giving those persons [[Undercover|cover stories]] and economic support.<ref name = "GEORGE"> {{cite web

===The structure stabilizes, 1952===
Then-DCI [[Walter Bedell Smith]], who enjoyed a special degree of Presidential trust, having been [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s primary Chief of Staff during World War II, insisted that the CIA{{ndash}} or at least only one department{{ndash}} had to direct the OPC and OSO.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} Those organization, as well as some minor functions, formed the euphemistically named [[National Clandestine Service|Directorate of Plans]] in 1952.

Also in 1952, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] were created, with some missions overlapping those of the Department of Plans. In general, the pattern emerged that the CIA could borrow resources from Special Forces, although it had its own special operators.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Early Cold War, 1953&ndash;1966===
[[Image:Usaf.u2.750pix.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lockheed U-2]] "Dragon Lady", the first generation of near-space reconnaissance aircraft.]]
{{Refimprovesect|date=June 2009}}
[[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]], who had been a key OSS operations officer in Switzerland during World War II, took over from Smith, at a time where US policy was dominated by intense [[Anti-communism|anticommunism]]. Various sources existed, the most visible being the investigations and abuses of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], and the more quiet but systematic containment doctrine developed by [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], the [[Berlin Blockade]] and the [[Korean War]]. Dulles enjoyed a high degree of flexibility, as his brother, [[John Foster Dulles]], was simultaneously Secretary of State.

Concern regarding the Soviet Union and the difficulty of getting information from its closed society, which few agents could penetrate, led to solutions based on advanced technology. Among the first success was with the Lockheed U-2 aircraft, which could take pictures and collect electronic signals from an altitude above Soviet air defenses' reach.  After Gary Powers was shot down by an SA-2 surface to air missile in 1960, causing an international incident, the [[SR-71]] was developed to take over this role.  [[Image:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The USAF's [[SR-71 Blackbird]] was developed from the CIA's [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] OXCART.]]

During this period, there were numerous covert actions against [[Nationalization of oil supplies|resource nationalism]] and [[socialism]]. The CIA overthrew a democratically-elected government for the first time during [[1953 Iranian coup d'<U+00E9>tat|Operation Ajax]], after Iran moved to take control of its petroleum reserves. Some of the largest operations were aimed at Cuba after the overthrow of the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] dictatorship, including assassination attempts against [[Fidel Castro]] and the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. There have been suggestions that the Soviet attempt to put missiles into Cuba came, indirectly, when they realized how badly they had been compromised by a US-UK defector in place, [[Oleg Penkovsky]].<ref name=Saved>{{citation

The CIA, working with the military, formed the joint National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to operate reconnaissance aircraft such as the SR-71 and later satellites. "The fact of" the United States operating reconnaissance satellites, like "the fact of" the existence of NRO, was highly classified for many years.

The first CIA mission to [[Indochina]], under the code name [[CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific#Vietnam 1954|Saigon Military Mission]] arrived in 1954, under [[Edward Lansdale]]. US-based analysts were simultaneously trying to project the evolution of political power, both if the scheduled referendum chose merger of the North and South, or if the South, the US client, stayed independent.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} Initially, the [[CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific#Southeast Asia 1962|US focus in Southeast Asia]] was on Laos, not Vietnam.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

During the period of US combat involvement in the Vietnam War, there was considerable argument about progress among the Department of Defense under [[Robert McNamara]], the CIA, and, to some extent, the intelligence staff of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|Military Assistance Command Vietnam]].<ref name=Adams1998 /> In general, the military was consistently more optimistic than the CIA. [[Samuel A. Adams|Sam Adams]], a junior CIA analyst with responsibilities for estimating the actual damage to the enemy, eventually resigned from the CIA, after expressing concern to Director of Central Intelligence [[Richard Helms]] with estimates that were changed for interagency and White House political reasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} Adams afterward wrote the book ''War of Numbers''.

===Abuses of CIA authority, 1970s&ndash;1990s===
Things came to a head in the mid-1970s, around the time of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]].{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} A dominant feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of US Presidency, the executive branch of the U.S. Government. Revelations about past CIA activities, such as assassinations and attempted assassinations of foreign leaders (most notably Fidel Castro) and illegal domestic spying on US citizens , provided the opportunities to execute Congressional oversight of US intelligence operations.<ref name="'70s 49">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= |pages=49<U+2013>51 |url= }}</ref>

Hastening the Central Intelligence Agency's fall from grace were the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by ex-CIA agents, and President [[Richard Nixon]]'s subsequent use of the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation of the burglary.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} In the famous "smoking gun" recording that led to President Nixon's resignation, Nixon ordered his chief of staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]], to tell the CIA that further investigation of Watergate would ''"open the whole can of worms"'' about the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba.<ref>{{cite web

Though within a couple of weeks the FBI demanded this request in writing, and when no such formal request came, the FBI resumed its investigation into the money trail. Nonetheless, when the smoking gun tapes were made public, damage to the public's perception of CIA's top officials, and thus to the CIA as a whole, could not be avoided.<ref name="Gray III">{{cite book |title= In Nixon's Web:A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate|last= Gray III|first= L.

In 1973, then-DCI [[James R. Schlesinger]] commissioned reports{{ndash}} known as the "[[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]]"{{ndash}} on illegal activities by the Agency. In December 1974, Investigative journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] broke the news of the "Family Jewels" in a front-page article in ''The New York Times'', revealing that the CIA had assassinated foreign leaders, and had illegally conducted surveillance on some 7,000 US citizens involved in the antiwar movement ([[Operation CHAOS]]).<ref name="'70s 49" /> The CIA had also experimented on people, who unknowingly took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (among other things).<ref name="'70s 49" />

Congress responded to the disturbing charges in 1975, investigating the CIA in the Senate via the [[Church Committee]], chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]] (D-Idaho), and in the House of Representatives via the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Pike Committee]], chaired by Congressman [[Otis G. Pike|Otis Pike]] (D-NY).<ref name="'70s 49" /> In addition, President [[Gerald Ford]] created the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]],<ref name="'70s 49" /> and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders. As the CIA fell out of favor with the public, Ford assured Americans that his administration was not involved: ''"There are no people presently employed in the White House who have a relationship with the CIA of which I am personally unaware."''<ref name="'70s 49" />

Repercussions from the [[Iran-Contra affair]] arms smuggling scandal included the creation of the [[Intelligence Authorization Act]] in 1991.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} It defined covert operations as secret missions in geopolitical areas where the US is neither openly nor apparently engaged. This also required an authorizing chain of command, including an official, presidential finding report and the informing of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which, in emergencies, requires only "timely notification".

===2004, DNI takes over CIA top-level functions===
The [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]] created the office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide functions that had previously been the CIA's. The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the [[Intelligence cycle management|intelligence cycle]]. Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies, and preparation of briefings for the president. On July 30, 2008, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13470]]<ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-13470.htm Executive Order 13470]</ref> amending [[Executive Order 12333]] to strengthen the role of the DNI.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/washington/AP-Intelligence-Rules.html "Bush Orders Intelligence Overhaul", by [[Associated Press]], July 31, 2008]</ref>

Previously, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) oversaw the Intelligence Community, serving as the president's principal intelligence advisor, additionally serving as head of the Central Intelligence Agency. The DCI's title now is "Director of the Central Intelligence Agency" (DCIA), serving as head of the CIA.

Currently, the Central Intelligence Agency reports to the Director of National Intelligence. Prior to the establishment of the DNI, the CIA reported to the President, with informational briefings to congressional committees. The [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] is a permanent member of the National Security Council, responsible for briefing the President with pertinent information collected by all U.S. intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, etc. All 16 Intelligence Community agencies are under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence.

==Mission-related issues and controversies==
{{Refimprovesect|date=June 2009}}
The history of CIA deals with several things, certainly including covert action, but also clandestine and overt intelligence collection, intelligence analysis and reporting, and logistical and technical support of its activities. Prior to the December 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community (IC), it also was responsible for coordinations of IC-wide intelligence estimates.

These articles are organized in two different ways: By geographical region (for state actors or non-state actors limited to a [[country]] or [[region]]) and by [[Transnationality|transnational]] topic (for non-state actors).

CIA operations by region, country and date are discussed in detail in the following articles:
*[[CIA activities in Africa]]
*[[CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific]]
*[[CIA activities in Russia and Europe]]
*[[CIA activities in the Americas]]
*[[CIA activities in the Near East, North Africa, South and Southwest Asia]]

CIA analyses of issues such as the effect of [[emerging infectious disease]]s, and the detection of [[Weapons of mass destruction]], are inherently transnational, and are discussed in the following articles. CIA operations and, where appropriate, authorizations for covert operations (for example, [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities|NSDD 138]] authorizing direct action against opponents) by transnational topic are discussed in the following Wikipedia articles:

*[[CIA transnational activities in counterproliferation]]
*[[CIA transnational anti-crime and anti-drug activities]]
*[[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities]]
*[[CIA transnational health and economic activities]]
*[[CIA transnational human rights actions]]

In addition, a view of covert US activity specifically oriented towards regime change actions is given in the following Wikipedia article:

Areas of controversy about inappropriate, often illegal actions include [[CIA transnational human rights actions#Human experimentation|experiments, without consent, on human beings]] to explore chemical means of eliciting information or disabling people. Another area involved [[CIA transnational human rights actions#Torture and rendition|torture and clandestine imprisonment]]. There have been [[CIA transnational human rights actions#Assassinations|attempted assassinations under CIA orders and support for assassinations of foreign leaders]] by citizens of the leader's country, and, in a somewhat different legal category that may fall under the customary laws of war, assassinations of militant leaders.

===Security and counterintelligence failures===
While the names change periodically, there are two basic security functions to protect the CIA and its operations. There is an Office of Security in the Directorate for Support, which is responsible for physical security of the CIA buildings, secure storage of information, and personnel [[security clearance]]s. These are directed inwardly to the agency itself.

In what is now the National Clandestine Service, there is a [[counter-intelligence]] function, called the Counterintelligence Staff under its most controversial chief, [[James Jesus Angleton]]. This function has roles including looking for staff members that are providing information to foreign intelligence services (FIS) as [[Counter-intelligence#Mole|moles]]. Another role is to check proposals for recruiting foreign HUMINT assets, to see if these people have any known ties to FIS and thus may be attempts to penetrate CIA to learn its personnel and practices, or as a provocateur, or other form of [[Counter-intelligence#Double Agent|double agent]].

This agency component may also launch [[Counter-intelligence#Offensive Counterintelligence Operations|offensive counterespionage]], where it attempts to interfere with FIS operations. CIA officers in the field often have assignments in offensive counterespionage as well as clandestine intelligence collection.

====Security failures====
In 1993, the headquarters of the CIA was [[1993 CIA shootings|attacked]] by Mir Aimal Kansi, a Pakistani national.  Two CIA employees were killed, Frank Darling and Lansing Bennett, M.D.

The "Family Jewels" and other documents reveal that the Office of Security violated the prohibition of CIA involvement in domestic law enforcement, sometimes with the intention of assisting police organizations local to CIA buildings.

====Counterintelligence failures====
Perhaps the most disruptive period involving counterintelligence was James Jesus Angleton's search for a mole,<ref name=WiseMole>{{citation

===Failures in intelligence analysis===
The agency has also been criticized for ineffectiveness as an intelligence gathering agency. Former DCI Richard Helms commented, after the end of the Cold War, "The only remaining superpower doesn't have enough interest in what's going on in the world to organize and run an espionage service."<ref>[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9644588 The CIA: On top of everything else, not very good at its job], Review of ''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' by Tim Weiner in ''[[The Economist]]'', August 16, 2007</ref>  The CIA has come under particular criticism for failing to predict the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)#Dissolution_of_the_USSR|collapse of the Soviet Union]].

See the [[intelligence analysis management#Information Technology|information technology]] section of the intelligence analysis management for discussion of possible failures to provide adequate automation support to analysts, and [[A-Space]] for a IC-wide program to collect some of them. [[Cognitive traps for intelligence analysis]] also goes into areas where CIA has examined why analysis can fail.

Agency veterans{{Who|date=April 2009}} have lamented CIA's inability to produce the kind of long-range strategic intelligence that it once did in order to guide policymakers. [[John E. McLaughlin|John McLaughlin]], who was deputy director and acting director of central intelligence from October 2000 to September 2004, said that CIA is drowned by demands from the White House and Pentagon for instant information, "intelligence analysts end up being the Wikipedia of Washington."<ref>{{cite news

}} </ref> In the intelligence analysis article, [[Intelligence analysis#Orienting oneself to the Consumers|orienting oneself to the consumers]] deals with some of ways in which intelligence can become more responsive to the needs of policymakers.

For the media, the failures are most newsworthy. A number of declassified National Intelligence Estimates do predict the behavior of various countries, but not in a manner attractive to news, or, most significantly, not public at the time of the event.  In its operational role, some successes for the CIA include the U-2 and SR-71 programs, and anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] operations in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

Among the first analytic failures, before the CIA had its own collection capabilities, it assured President Harry S Truman on October 13, 1950 that the Chinese would not send troops to Korea. Six days later, over one million Chinese troops arrived.<ref>{{cite web

The history of US intelligence, with respect to French Indochina and then the two Vietnams, is long and complex. The [[Pentagon Papers]] often contain pessimistic CIA analyses that conflicted with White House positions.

Another criticism is the failure to predict [[Pokhran-II|India's nuclear tests]] in 1974. A review of the various analyses of [[CIA Activities by Region: Near East, North Africa, South and Southwest Asia#India|India's nuclear program]] did predict some aspects of the test, such as a 1965 report saying, correctly, that if India did develop a bomb, it would be explained as "for peaceful purposes".

A major criticism is failure to forestall the [[September 11 attacks]].  The [[9/11 Commission Report]] identifies failures in the IC as a whole. One problem, for example, was the FBI failing to "connect the dots" by sharing information among its decentralized field offices. The report, however, criticizes both CIA analysis, and impeding their investigation{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

The executive summary of a report which was released by the office of CIA Inspector General John Helgerson on August 21, 2007 concluded that former DCI [[George Tenet]] failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by [[Al-Qaeda]] prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001.  The report had been completed in June, 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with Congress, over the objections of current DCI General [[Michael Hayden]]. Hayden said its publication would "consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news

===Questionable/controversial tactics===
{{Main|CIA transnational human rights actions}}
{{See also|Project MKULTRA|Extraordinary rendition by the United States|Church Committee|Covert U.S. regime change actions}}

The CIA has been called into question on several occasions for some of the tactics it employs to carry out its missions. At times these tactics have included torture, [[CIA_transnational_human_rights_actions#Police_training|training of groups and organizations]] that would later participate in killing of civilians and other non-combatants, human experimentation, and targeted killings and assassinations.

In understanding the CIA's role in human rights, there are challenging problems of ethics. John Stockwell, a CIA officer who left the Agency and became a public critic, said of the CIA field officers: "They don't meet the death squads on the streets where they're actually chopping up people or laying them down on the street and running trucks over their heads. The CIA people in San Salvador meet the police chiefs, and the people who run the death squads, and they do liaise with them, they meet them beside the swimming pool of the villas. And it's a sophisticated, civilized kind of relationship. And they talk about their children, who are going to school at UCLA or Harvard and other schools, and they don't talk about the horrors of what's being done. They pretend like it isn't true".<ref name=Stockwell>{{citation

===External investigations and document releases===
{{Main|Official reports by the US Government on the CIA}}
At various times since the creation of the CIA, the US Government has produced comprehensive reports on CIA actions that marked historical watersheds in how CIA went about trying to fulfill its vague charter purposes from 1947.  These reports were the result of internal/presidential studies, external investigations by Congressional committees or other arms of the US Government, or even the simple releases and declassification of large quantities of documents by the CIA.

Several investigations (e.g., the Church Committee, Rockefeller Commission, Pike Committee, etc.), as well as released declassified documents, reveal that the CIA, at times, operated outside its charter. In some cases, such as during Watergate, this may have been due to inappropriate requests by White House staff. In other cases, there was a violation of Congressional intent, such as the Iran-Contra affair. In many cases, these reports provide the only official discussion of these actions available to the public.

===Influencing public opinion and law enforcement===
{{See also|CIA influence on public opinion|CIA and the media|CIA in fiction and the movies|Robertson Panel|Operation Mockingbird}}
This is an area with many shades of gray. There is little argument, for example, that the CIA acted inappropriately in providing technical support to White House operatives conducting both political and security investigations, with no legal authority to do so. Things become much more ambiguous when law enforcement may expose a clandestine operation, a problem not unique to intelligence but also seen among different law enforcement organizations, where one wants to prosecute and another to continue investigations, perhaps reaching higher levels in a conspiracy.<ref name=SaundersCulture>{{cite book

===Involvements with former Nazi and Japanese war criminals===
{{Main|U.S. intelligence involvement with German and Japanese war criminals after World War II}}

While the United States was involved in the prosecution of war criminals, U.S. military and intelligence agencies protected some war criminals in the interest of obtaining technical or intelligence information from them, or taking part in ongoing intelligence or engineering (e.g., [[Operation Paperclip]]). Multiple US intelligence organizations were involved, and many of these relationships were formed before the creation of the CIA in 1947, but the CIA, in some cases, took over the relationships and concealed them for nearly 60 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Al-Qaeda and the War on Terror===

{{See|CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities|CIA transnational human rights actions}}

The CIA had long been dealing with terrorism originating from abroad, and in 1986 had set up a [[Counterterrorist Center]] to deal specifically with the problem. At first confronted with secular terrorism, the Agency found [[Islamism|Islamist]] terrorism looming increasingly large on its scope.

The network that became known as al-Qaeda (The Base) grew out of Arab volunteers who fought the Soviets and their puppet regimes in Afghanistan in the 1980s.  In 1984 [[Abdullah Azzam]] and [[Osama bin Laden]] set up an organization known as the [[Maktab al-Khidamat|Office of Services]] in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, to coordinate and finance the "Afghan Arabs", as the volunteers became known.

The CIA also channeled US aid to Afghan resistance fighters via Pakistan in a covert operation known as [[Operation Cyclone]].  It denied dealing with non-Afghan fighters, or having direct contact with bin Laden.<ref>Steve Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (Penguin, 2005 edn), p.87.</ref>  However, various authorities relate that the Agency brought both Afghans and Arabs to the United States for military training.<ref>Giles Foden, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,551971,00.html "Blowback Chronicles"], ''Guardian'', Sept. 15, 2001; referring to John Cooley, ''Unholy Wars: Afghanistan, America and International Terrorism'' (Pluto Press, no date given)</ref><ref>[http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/foxnews071802.html Cooperative Research transcript of Fox TV interview with J. Michael Springmann (head of the non-immigrant visa section at the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 1987-88) July 18, 2002.]</ref><ref>[http://911review.org/Wiki/CiaVisasForPatsies.shtml transcript of Springmann interview with CBC, July 3, 2002], ''9/11 Review''.</ref>  Azzam and Bin Laden set up recruitment offices in the US, under the name "[[Al Kifah Refugee Center|Al-Khifah]]", the hub of which was the Farouq Mosque in Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue.  This was "a place of pivotal importance for Operation Cyclone".<ref>Andrew Marshall, [http://www.geocities.com/libertystrikesback/blowback.html "Terror 'blowback' burns CIA: America's spies paid and trained their nation's worst enemies"], ''Independent On Sunday'' (copy), Nov. 1, 1998.</ref>

Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center was the Egyptian "double agent" [[Ali Mohamed]], who worked for the CIA, the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]], [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] and [[al-Qaeda]] at various times in the 1980s and 1990s.  FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called him "bin Laden's first trainer".<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html Cloonan ''Frontline'' interview], PBS, July 13, 2005.</ref>  Another was "Blind Sheikh" [[Abdul Rahman Yasin|Abdel Rahman]], a leading recruiter of ''mujaheddin'', who obtained US entry visas with the help of the CIA in 1987 and 1990.

Around 1988, Bin Laden set up al-Qaeda from the more extreme elements of the Services Office.  But it was not a large organization.  When [[Jamal al-Fadl]] (who had been recruited through the Brooklyn center in the mid 1980s) joined in 1989, he was described as Qaeda's "third member".<ref>Peter L Bergen, ''Holy War, Inc: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden'' (Weidenfield & Nicholson, 2001), p.65.</ref>

In January 1996 the CIA created an experimental "virtual station", the [[Bin Laden Issue Station]], under the Counterterrorist Center, to track Bin Laden's developing activities.  Al-Fadl, who defected to the CIA in spring 1996, began to provide the Station with a new image of the Qaeda leader: he was not only a terrorist financier, but a terrorist organizer too.  FBI special agent Dan Coleman (who together with his partner Jack Cloonan had been "seconded" to the Bin Laden Station) called him Qaeda's "[[Rosetta Stone]]".<ref>Jane Mayer, [http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060911fa_fact "Junior: The clandestine life of America's top Al Qaeda source"], ''New Yorker'', Sept. 11, 2006.</ref>

In 1999 CIA chief George Tenet launched a grand "Plan" to deal with al-Qaeda.  The Counterterrorist Center, its new chief [[Cofer Black]] and the center's [[Bin Laden Issue Station|Bin Laden unit]] were the Plan's developers and executors.  Once it was prepared Tenet assigned CIA intelligence chief [[Charles E. Allen]] to set up a "Qaeda cell" to oversee its tactical execution.<ref>Tenet, ''At The Center of the Storm'', pp.119, 120.</ref>  In 2000 the CIA and [[USAF]] jointly ran a series of flights over Afghanistan with a small remote-controlled reconnaissance drone, the [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]]; they obtained probable photos of Bin Laden.  Cofer Black and others became advocates of arming the Predator with missiles to try to assassinate Bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders.  After the Cabinet-level Principals Committee meeting on terrorism of September 4, 2001, the CIA resumed reconnaissance flights, the drones now being weapons-capable.

The CIA set up a [[Strategic Assessments Branch]] in 2001 to remedy the deficit of "big-picture" analysis of al-Qaeda, and apparently to develop targeting strategies.  The branch was formally set up in July 2001, but it struggled to find personnel.  The branch's head took up his job on September 10, 2001.<ref>''9/11 Commission Report'', [http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch11.pdf chapter 11], p.342 ([http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch11.htm HTML version])</ref><ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/part3.pdf Joint Inquiry Final Report, part three], p.387.</ref><ref>[http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing8/tenet_statement.pdf Tenet statement to the 9/11 Commission, March 24, 2004], p.8.</ref>

After 9/11, the CIA came under criticism for not having done enough to prevent the attacks.  Tenet rejected the criticism, citing the Agency's planning efforts especially over the preceding two years.  He also considered that the CIA's efforts had put the Agency in a position to respond rapidly and effectively to the attacks, both in the "Afghan sanctuary" and in "ninety-two countries around the world".<ref>George Tenet, ''At The Center Of The Storm'' (Harper Press, 2007), pp.121<U+2013>2; cf. p.178.</ref>  The new strategy was called the "[[Worldwide Attack Matrix]]".

===2003 War in Iraq===
{{Main|CIA activities in Iraq}}
{{See|Plame affair|CIA activities in the Near East, North Africa, South and Southwest Asia}}
Whether or not the intelligence available, or presented by the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration justified the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] or allowed proper planning, especially for the occupation, is quite controversial. However, there were more than one CIA employee that asserted the sense that Bush administration officials placed undue pressure on CIA analysts to reach certain conclusions that would support their stated policy positions with regard to Iraq.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

CIA [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary teams were the first teams in Iraq arriving in July 2002.  Once on the ground they prepared the battle space for the subsequent arrival of [[US military]] forces.  SAD teams then combined with [[US Army Special Forces]] (on a team called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element or NILE)  <ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004">Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, Simon and Shuster, 2004. </ref>.  This team organized the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]] for the subsequent US-led invasion.  They combined to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], an ally of [[Al-Qaeda]].  If this battle had not been as successful as it was, there would have been a considerable hostile force behind the US/Kurdish force in the subsequent assault on Saddam's Army.  The US side was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD/SOG and the Army's [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]]. <ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq |first=Mike |last=Tucker |coauthors=Charles Faddis |year=2008 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=9781599213668}}</ref><ref>http://wamu.org/audio/dr/08/10/r2081007-22101.asx An interview on public radio with the author</ref>

SAD teams also conducted high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets.  These missions led to the initial strikes against [[Saddam Hussein]] and his key generals.  Although the initial strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces.  Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the US-led invasion force.  <ref name="ReferenceA">Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, Simon and Shuster, 2004.</ref><ref>Behind lines, an unseen war, Faye Bowers, Christian Science Monitor, April 2003.</ref>

NATO member [[Turkey]] refused to allow its territory to be used by the US Army's 4th Infantry Division for the invasion.  As a result, the SAD, US Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire northern force against Saddam's Army during the invasion.  Their efforts kept the 1st and 5th Corps of the Iraqi Army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than their moving to contest the coalition force coming from the south.  This combined US Special Operations and Kurdish force soundly defeated Saddam's Army, a major military success, similar to the victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan.  <ref name="ReferenceA" />  Four members of the SAD/SOG team received CIA's rare [[Intelligence Star]] for their "heroic actions." <ref>Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq, Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press |isbn=9781599213668</ref>

===Drug trafficking===
{{Main|CIA transnational anti-crime and anti-drug activities|CIA drug trafficking}}

Two offices of [[Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Intelligence|CIA Directorate of Intelligence]] have analytical responsibilities in this area. The Office of Transnational Issues<ref>{{ citation

|title=Office of Transnational Issues}}</ref> applies unique functional expertise to assess existing and emerging threats to US national security and provides the most senior US policymakers, military planners, and law enforcement with analysis, warning, and crisis support.

CIA Crime and Narcotics Center<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/organization-1/the-cia-crime-and-narcotics-center.html
|title=CIA Crime and Narcotics Center}}</ref> researches information on [[illegal drug trade|international narcotics trafficking]] and organized crime for policymakers and the law enforcement community. Since CIA has no domestic police authority, it sends its analytic information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement organizations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] (OFAC).

Another part of CIA, the National Clandestine Service, collects human intelligence (HUMINT) in these areas.

Research by Dr. [[Alfred W. McCoy]], [[Gary Webb]], and others has pointed to CIA involvement in narcotics trafficking across the globe, although the CIA officially denies such allegations.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} During the Cold War, when numerous soldiers participated in transport of Southeast Asian heroin to the United States by the airline [[Air America (airline)|Air America]]{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}, the CIA's role in such traffic was reportedly rationalized as "recapture" of related profits to prevent possible enemy control of such assets. Researchers{{Who|date=April 2009}} point to similar operations during Reagan's Contra War in Nicaragua, US involvement in Afghanistan during the Cold War, and current CIA involvement with Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] intelligence agency, which allegedly has links to the refining of Afghan heroin in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Lying to Congress===
Speaker of the [[United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] has stated that the CIA repeatedly misled the Congress since 2001 about waterboarding and other torture.<ref>{{ citation|http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a0vWnerimBZw}}</ref><ref>BBC News, May 14, 2009, "Pelosi says CIA lied on 'torture'" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8050930.stm</ref> Six members of Congress have stated that Director of CIA Leon Panetta admitted that over a period of several years since 2001 the CIA regularly deceived Congress, including affirmatively lying to Congress.

====Covert programs hidden from Congress ====
On July 10, 2009, House Intelligence subcommittee Chairwoman Representative [[Jan Schakowsky]] announced the termination of an unnamed CIA covert program described as "very serious" in nature which had been kept secret from Congress for eight years.<ref>{{ citation|http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_congress_secret_briefings}}</ref>

CIA Director Panetta had ordered an internal investigation to determine why Congress had not been informed about the covert program. Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Representative [[Silvestre Reyes]] announced that that he is considering an investigation into alleged CIA violations of the [[National Security Act]], which requires with limited exception that Congress be informed of covert activities.

As mandated by [[Title 50 of the United States Code]] Chapter 15, Subchapter III, when it becomes necessary to limit access to covert operations findings that could affect vital interests of the US, as soon as possible the President must report at a minimum to the [[Gang of Eight]].<ref>http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/413b.html#c_2</ref>
The House is expected to support the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Bill including a provision that would require the President to inform more than 40 members of Congress about covert operations.  The Obama administration White House threatened to veto the final version of a bill that included such a provision.<ref>http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gQDNMgQrXYHlGWd9F3063DLFpiHAD99BMNVG2</ref><ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090708/ap_on_go_co/us_congress_secret_briefings</ref>  On July 16, 2008 the fiscal 2009 Intelligence Authorization Bill was approved by House majority containing stipulations that 75% of money sought for covert actions would be held until all members of the House Intelligence panel were briefed on sensitive covert actions.

Allegations by Director Panetta indicate that details of a secret counterterrorism program were withheld from Congress under orders from former U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]].

Congresswoman [[Jan Schakowsky]], Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, who called for the investigation, stated that the investigation was intended to address CIA failures to inform Congress fully or accurately about four issues: C.I.A. involvement in the downing of a missionary plane mistaken for a narcotics flight in Peru in 2001, and two "''matters that remain classified''", as well as the rumored-assassinations question.  In addition, the inquiry is likely to look at the Bush administration<U+2019>s program of eavesdropping without warrants and its detention and interrogation program<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/us/politics/18intel.html%20</ref>.
