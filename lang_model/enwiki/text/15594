'''William Samuel Sadler''' (June 14, 1875&nbsp;<U+2013> April 26, 1969) was an American [[psychiatrist]] and author who played a key role in the ''[[The Urantia Book]]'' movement. A native of [[Indiana]], he moved to [[Michigan]] to work at the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] as a teenager and became acquainted with [[John Harvey Kellogg]]. Sadler was influenced by some of Kellogg's views, and married his niece, [[Lena Celestia Kellogg]].

As a young man, Sadler worked for several Christian missionary and charitable organizations and attended [[Medical school]]. He graduated from [[American Medical Missionary College]] in 1906 and studied psychiatry in Europe under [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1910. After finishing his education, Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago. He initially worked as a surgeon, but expanded his practice to offer psychiatric counseling. He joined several medical associations, and taught at the [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] and the Post-Graduate Medical School of Chicago. In 1907, along with his wife, Sadler became a speaker on the [[Chautauqua]] adult-education circuit. He eventually became a highly-paid, popular speaker. He wrote many books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics, advocating a [[holistic]] approach to health. Although he was a committed member of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] for almost twenty years, he left the church in 1907, after the excommunication of John Harvey Kellogg. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion, but embraced scientific consensus and was skeptical of [[mediums]]. He worked with [[Howard Thurston]] in his efforts to debunk psychics.

Around 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. After Sadler observed the patient, the sleeping man began claiming to be an extraterrestrial speaking through the subject. After unsuccessful attempts to explain the phenomena, Sadler concluded that extraterrestrials were communicating through the patient. For many years, Salder and a small number of assistants visited the man while he was sleeping and held long conversations about spirituality and history. A larger number of interested people met as a group at Sadler's home, discussed the man's responses, and suggested additional questions. The man's responses were eventually compiled in ''The Urantia Book'' and the [[Urantia Foundation]] was created to spread its message. Although it never became an organized religion, the book attracted committed followers who devoted themselves to its study. Sadler had close ties to the Urantia Foundation until his death in 1969.

==Early life and education==
Sadler was born June 14, 1875 in [[Spencer, Indiana]], and was raised in [[Wabash, Indiana]]. He was the first child of Samuel Cavins Sadler and Sarah Isabelle Wilson; Sarah later gave birth to twin daughters, one of whom survived to adulthood.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=35}} Sadler was of English and Irish descent.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=30}}

Although Samuel was a music teacher, he did not enroll his son in public schools.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}}{{cref2|A}} Notwithstanding his lack of formal education, Sadler was very intelligent and read many books about history as a child. He was also a skilled speaker, and became comfortable speaking to crowds while at a young age.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=24}} Initially non-religious, Samuel became a Seventh-day Adventist<U+2014>and worked as a bible salesman<U+2014>after the death of a daughter.{{cref2|B}} His son was baptized as an Adventist in 1888{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=35}} and became devoutly religious.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}} In 1889, Sadler moved to [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] to work at the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] and attend [[Battle Creek College]], institutions with strong Adventist ties.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=35}}{{cref2|C}} While working at the Sanitarium, Sadler was mentored by John Harvey Kellogg.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=25}}

Sadler graduated from Battle Creek College in 1894{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}} and worked for [[William K. Kellogg]]{{cref2|D}} as a [[health-food]] salesman.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=25}} Detective work was a hobby of Sadler's at that time: he worked with a society that sought to enforce the [[Comstock laws]] and was eventually recruited by a Federal law enforcement agency, though he did not accept their offer.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=26}} Around 1895,{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=25}} Salder attended [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he trained to be an evangelist. After finishing his education at Moody, he oversaw Life Boat Mission, a [[Mission (station)|mission]] that Kellogg had founded on [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]].{{cref2|E}} While overseeing the mission, Sadler also published a newspaper known as ''Life Boat Magazine''.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}}{{cref2|F}} He contributed articles to other Adventist publications, as well.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=55}}

In 1897, Sadler married John Harvey Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, a nurse and fellow Adventist he had met for four years previously.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}} Their first child was born in 1899, but died a short time later.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=26}} Their second child, William S. Sadler Jr., was born in 1907 and survived to adulthood.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=40}} The couple moved to [[San Francisco, California]], in 1901, to attend [[medical school]] at [[Cooper Medical College]]. While attending the college, Sadler worked as a chemistry tutor.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=26}} That year, he also became an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] in the Adventist church. While in San Francisco, Sadler was active in the church, serving as the "superintendent of young people's work" for the church's California conference and the president of the San Francisco Medical Missionary and Benevolent Society.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}} He and his wife also operated a home for Christian medical students.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=26}} In 1904, the couple returned to Michigan, where he attended the [[American Medical Missionary College]].{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}}{{cref2|G}} Two years later, Sadler received a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}} In 1910, he and his wife traveled to Europe and studied psychiatry under [[Sigmund Freud]] in [[Vienna, Austria]].{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=27}} Sadler was an relatively early adopter of Freudian psychoanalysis,{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}} though he did not accept many of Freud's ideas about sexuality or religion.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=27}}

Although Sadler was a committed Adventist for much of his early life, he left the church around 1907. At that time, John Harvey Kellogg left the Adventist church owing to his suspicions about the integrity of [[Ellen G. White]], the church's founder. He was excommunicated, and the Sadlers subsequently joined other former Adventists to criticize the church.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=147}}

==Career==
In 1912, Sadler and his wife, also a doctor by then, began to practice medicine in the Chicago area. They operated a joint practice focused on "women's and children's diseases".{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=38}} Sadler initially focused his practice on surgery (in some cases, he jointly performed surgeries with his wife) but began to concentrate on psychiatric counseling in 1930{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=27}} and served as a consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}}

Journalist [[Brad Gooch]] writes in his 2002 profile of the Urantia movement that Sandler and his wife moved into an [[Art Nouveau]]-style house on Chicago's [[Diversey Parkway (Chicago)|Diversey Parkway]]{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=5}} in 1912.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=6}}{{cref2|H}} It is the first [[steel-frame]] residence in Chicago. The couple operated their medical practice out of the building.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=142}}{{cref2|I}} Sadler was also a professor of psychiatry at the Post-Graduate Medical School of Chicago and a member of numerous medical associations, including the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the American Pathological Society, the [[American College of Surgeons]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}}

Sadler wrote and lectured on many topics.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=39}} In 1909, he published his first book, an evangelical work titled ''Self-Winning Texts, or Bible Helps for Personal Work''.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=36}} He wrote forty two books on health issues.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=4}} In the 1910s, he regularly worked all night on his writing projects.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=29}}

In 1907, Sadler and his wife began giving [[Chautauqua]] adult-education lectures. Sadler often spoke about attaining physical and mental health without the use of drugs. He also promoted [[hydrotherapy]] and discussed moral issues that related to men. While lecturing, he was often perceived as humorous and extroverted. Along with his wife, her sister, and a friend, Sadler was part of a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day lecturing engagements.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=39}} They were sometimes accompanied by an [[orchestra]]. Sadler's books were also sold at the events. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=40}} and the lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor; he was rumored to be one of the best paid Chautauqua speakers.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}}

Sadler was a member of the faculty of [[McCormick Theological Seminary]],{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=4}} and taught pastoral psychology.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}} He also delivered a keynote address on the subject at a event for members of [[college religious organizations]].{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}}

==Views==
<!-- commenting out for now: In a 1917 lecture, Sadler predicted the advent of [[organ transplantation]].{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=4}} Around that time, he argued that [[alcoholism]] is a hereditary condition.{{sfn|Nelkin & Lindee|2004|p=23}}-->
Sadler's early writings writings about health bore noticeable similarities to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of [[autointoxication]] and the idea that [[caffeine]] has negative [[Health effects of caffeine|health effects]]. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=62}} Later in his life, Sadler dropped these themes from his writings.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=63}}{{cref2|J}} He also differed from Kellogg by accepting [[masturbation]] as a harmless act.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=72}}

Sadler believed that religion was beneficial for mental health reasons,<ref name=cdt>{{cite news|title=Calls Religion Big Influence in Mental Health|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/459999212.html?dids=459999212:459999212&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=May+09%2C+1936&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=CALLS+RELIGION+BIG+INFLUENCE+IN+MENTAL+HEALTH&pqatl=google|accessdate=February 21, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=May 9, 1936|page=12}}</ref> and specifically promoted prayer on these grounds.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=45}} He argued in 1914 that prayer is most effective as a product of Christian faith.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=45}} Although he spoke of exceptionally supernatural aspects of Christianity in a 1912 publication,{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=47}} he later disavowed ideas such as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]], the [[Blood atonement]], and the [[Resurrection of Christ]]. He also rejected his faith in some Seventh-day Adventist teachings, such as the status of Ellen G. White as a prophetess and the importance of Saturday as the [[Sabbath]].{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=48}} However, he retained a positive view of White and rejected the idea that she was a charlatan.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=26}}

According to Brook Wilensky-Lanford's 2011 study of the Urantia movement, Sadler "prided himself on his rationality and progressiveness."{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}} It is also likely that Sadler accepted the [[Theory of Evolution]] as well as the scientific consensus about the [[age of the Earth]] and the [[age of the universe]].{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=48}} Sadler also had an interest in [[eugenics]], possibly owing to Kellogg's interest in the concept.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=94}} Sadler believed that mediums were a source of false comfort to people. After [[World War I]] ended, he fought against the increased popularity of communication with the dead. He also argued that [[glossolalia]] and [[levitation]] had "proved to be fraudulent."{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=144}} In the 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes.{{cref2|K}} He regularly worked with a [[Northwestern University]] psychologist and [[Howard Thurston]], then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=29}} Sadler may have also met the magician [[Harry Houdini]] (who was also a skeptic) around this time.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=30}}

==Urantia revelation==
Between 1906 and 1911, a woman consulted Sadler about her husband's deep sleeping.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=132}} [[Joscelyn Godwin]] of [[Colgate University]]{{sfn|Goodwin|1998|p=350}} and [[Scientific skepticism|skeptic]] [[Martin Gardner]]{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=209}} argue that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=51}} Kellogg was married to Lena's sister Anna; the two were first cousins who shared John Kellogg as an uncle.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=98}} Sadler observed the sleeping man and noticed unusual movements. The sleeping man purportedly spoke to Sadler in an unusual voice and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler and five others regularly visited the man and spoke with him as he slept. The man's voice was said by observers to carry messages from several beings. Sadler suspected that the voice was coming from the man's mind, and sought a scientific explanation for the phenomena. Although Sadler examined him for psychiatric problems and hypnotized him, he was unable to find a satisfactory diagnosis. In 1925, a large handwritten document was discovered in the patient's house.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=132}} Sadler presumed that the document was the product of [[automatic handwriting]], but changed his mind after a [[handwriting analysis]] of the papers.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=133}} Papers were said to appear in the man's house for years afterwards.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=31}} Sadler kept the papers at his house and did not allow anyone to take them, though some people were allowed to read them on site.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=118}}

In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=141}} tea gatherings at their home, which could accommodate fifty guests. Many attendees worked in the medical establishment, and typically adhered to a [[Progressivism|progressive]] ideology.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=142}}{{cref2|L}} The group often held a forum discussion of the sleeping patient in which they devised questions for the sleeping man that were then posed to him as he slept. The observers did not divulge the man's name to the group, but did relate some of his answers. In 1925, the forum began to require a pledge of secrecy and ceased to accept new members.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=133}} At that time, there were thirty members in the group.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=31}} Sadler instructed the members of the forum not to publicize all the details of which they were aware, noting that as many details of the revelation were unknown, they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. Sadler also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity was known.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=134}}

In 1935, Salder concluded that the papers were not a hoax, citing the papers' "genuineness and insight" as the factors that convinced him.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=32}} He and the other observers argued that the sleeping man was not a [[Mediumship|medium]],{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=199}} but believed that through him they were conversing with extraterrestrials.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=403}} Sadler retained his disdain for mediumship after leaving the Seventh-day Adventist church. Belief in the truth of the sleeping man's revelations was justified by the contention that living beings were communicating, rather than the spirits of the dead.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=205}} Sadler took a clear role as leader of the discussion group in the late 1930s, around the time that papers ceased appearing in the sleeping man's house. In the early 1940s, Sadler's leadership was objected to by [[Harold Sherman]], a writer who was a member of the forum.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=32}} Sherman alleged that Sadler had altered the contents of the original manuscripts.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=33}} The papers were compiled and published as ''The Urantia Book''{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=133}} in 1955.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=118}} Although Sadler had left the Adventist church by the time ''The Urantia Book'' was published, the teachings of ''The Urantia Book'' are broadly consistent with some aspects of Adventist theology, in addition to their novel doctrines.{{sfn|Goodwin|1998|p=350}} ''The Urantia Book'' presents a detailed description of [[cosmology]] as well as information about [[God]] and characters from the [[Bible]].{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=12}} Wilensky-Lanford argues that Sadler's departure from the Adventist church gave him the desire to build a new religious movement, citing the emphasis that Sadler placed on the discussion of the [[Garden of Eden]] in ''The Urantia Book'' as evidence of his desire to start anew.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=148}} Salder hoped that the content of the revelation would convince people of its worth, and did not attempt to win supporters by emphasizing the value of the messenger.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=202}} Wilensky-Lanford argues that Sadler and members of his forum attempted to avoid placing a person at the center of their beliefs owing to their disappointment in Ellen White.{{sfn|Wilensky-Lanford|2011|p=150}} Gooch argues that Sadler was the author of ''The Urantia Book'', citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of Sadler's earlier writings.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=56}} Ken Glasziou, a proponent of the doctrine's of ''The Urantia Book'', has argued that statistical evidence indicates that Sadler did not write the book nor extensively edit it.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=209}}

Sadler used some of the proceeds of the sales to pay off the mortgage of his house, a decision which angered his son, who was then devoted to the message of ''The Urantia Book''.{{cref2|M}} The two also came into conflict regarding the leadership of the Urantia Foundation. William Sadler, Jr. argued that the group should be promoted as an [[organized religion]]; the foundation's leadership opted for a policy referred to as "slow growth".{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=40}} Early supporters of the message of ''The Urantia Book'' wished to focus on educating people about the book's teachings than founding a church-like organization.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=144}} Sadler disavowed proselytizing and did not seek publicity.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=24}}

==Final years==
In 1952, Sadler's final book was published. He authored another title, but his publisher declined to accept it and he decided to stop writing.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=35}}

Sadler died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age.<ref name=ct>{{cite news|title=Dr. Sadler, 93, Dies; Services Are Scheduled|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/584698282.html?dids=584698282:584698282&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+28%2C+1969&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=DR.+SADLER%2C+93%2C+DIES%3B+SERVICES+ARE+SCHEDULED&pqatl=google|accessdate=February 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 28, 1969|page=B18}}</ref> The night before his death, he was visited by friends and family. He spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=35}} He received a full-column obituary in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', which discussed his success as a doctor but did not mention his association with the Urantia Foundation.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=4}}

==Reception==
By the time of his death, Sadler was acclaimed for his accurate prediction of the advent of organ transplantation decades before the practice became commonplace.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=4}} Members of the Urantia movement have held a high opinion of Sadler, sometimes idolizing him. In a 2003 profile of the Urantia movement, Sarah Lewis of [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], states that descriptions of Sadler by members of the movement could suggest that he has [[charismatic authority]] and is revered as "the chosen".{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=144}} Gooch deems Sadler the "Moses of the Urantia movement" and states that he is "one of America's homegrown religious leaders, an original along the lines of Joseph Smith".{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=23}} 

Gooch sees a clear contradiction between Sadler's public reputation as a advocate of science and reason and the novel theological, extraterrestrial-focused contents of ''The Urantia Book''.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=4<U+2013>5}} Gardner describes Sadler's life story as "riveting" and summarizes him as an "intelligent, gifted" person who proved to be astonishingly "gullible" about alleged supernatural revelations.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=407}} He contends that Sadler eventually developed [[megalomania]] that was unrecognized by those around him.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=319}} He argues that Sadler succumbed to hubris and began to believe that he was a prophet, divinely chosen{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=272}} as the founder and leader of a new religion.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=319}} Lewis disputes this characterization, maintaining that Sadler and those around him sought only to clarify and explain the truths of the Bible.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=143}}
