On 10 November 1982, [[Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev]], the third [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) and the fifth [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]], died after suffering a [[heart attack]] following years of serious ailments. His death was officially acknowledged on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television. After five days of national mourning, Brezhnev was given a [[state funeral]] and then buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. [[Yuri Andropov]], Brezhnev's successor as general secretary, was elected chairman of the committee preparing and managing Brezhnev's funeral. Brezhnev's funeral was on 15 November.

The funeral was attended by 32 [[heads of state]], 15 [[heads of government]], 14 [[foreign ministers]] and four [[prince]]s; US President [[Ronald Reagan]] refused to attend and sent [[George H. W. Bush]], the [[Vice President of the United States]], instead. The funeral speech was delivered by Andropov, [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], [[Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov|Anatoly Alexandrov]] and a factory worker. Brezhnev's funeral started the so-called [[Era of Magnificent Funerals]], when top Soviet statesmen died one after another.

==Death and declaration==
Brezhnev had struggled with several ailments since 1974, most notably heart disease, [[leukemia]], jaw [[cancer]], [[emphysema]] and circulatory disease. There were rumours of Brezhnev's death ever since the mid-1970s, due his faltering appearance and his absence in crucial meetings demanded by [[protocol (politics)|protocol]].<ref>{{cite news| author=Blake, Patricia|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955024,00.html | title = The Soviets: A Mix of Caution and Opportunism | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | language = | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 1 }}</ref> Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the [[Soviet Government]] insisted that he was not ill.<ref name="dyingoldman"/> He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office until he died on 10 November 1982 after suffering a [[heart attack]].<ref name="dyingoldman">{{Cite book | author = [[Robert Service (historian)|Service, Robert]] | title = History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century | location = | publisher = [[Penguin Books Ltd]] | year = 2009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=o8Z1QAAACAAJ&dq | isbn = 0141037970 | page = 426 }}</ref> He was honoured with a state funeral in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] on the [[Red Square]] after a five-day period of nationwide mourning.<ref name="rumours">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/10/newsid_2516000/2516417.stm | title = 1982: Brezhnev rumours sweep Moscow | publisher = [[BBC Online]] | language = | date= 10 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | quote = }}</ref> 

The first hint of his death to the [[Soviet people]] came on 7:15 [[12-hour clock|p.m.]] [[Moscow Time]], when the usual television programs were altered and a pop music concert was replaced by a documentary on [[Vladimir Lenin]]. On ''[[Vremya]]'', the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal [[dress code]]. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] a few days earlier. Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an [[ice hockey]] game on [[Channel Two (Russia)|Channel Two]] with [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|''Path<U+00E9>tique'' symphony]]. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by [[Soviet radio]] and [[Television in the Soviet Union|television]] hosts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955057,00.html | title = The Soviets: Changing the Guard | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | language = | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 1 }}</ref> The television announcement was read by [[Igor Kirillov]] with tears in his eyes at 11 [[24-hour clock|a.m.]] Moscow Time.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Schmidt-H<U+00E4>uer, Christian | title = Gorbachev: the path to power | location = | publisher = [[I.B.Tauris]] | year = 1986 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=1Of3z2l3XrYC&dq | isbn = 1850430152 | page = 80 }}</ref> 

[[First World]] commentators had already speculated that Brezhnev had died when he failed to sign a message of congratulations to [[Jos<U+00E9> Eduardo dos Santos]], the [[President of Angola]], for the Angolan [[Public holidays in Angola|Independence Day]]. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the [[Soviet leadership]] over who would succeed him. [[Konstantin Chernenko]] was seen as the most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.<ref name="rumours"/>

==Funeral service==
[[Yuri Andropov]] was  on 11 November elected chairman of the committee in charge of arranging, managing and preparing Brezhnev's funeral. This election marked the beginning of Brezhnev's funeral. The occasion was seen as a sign by [[First World]] commentators that Andropov was the most likely candidate for the position of general secretary.<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Stephen K.

During the funerals of Soviet leaders there was a custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin.<ref name ="Pravda">{{cite web |url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/07-09-2009/109122-funeral-0/|title= Most Pompous Funeral Ceremonies of All Times Were Held in Soviet Union|work=[[Pravda]]|accessdate= 22 January 2011}}</ref> This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it.<ref name ="Pravda"/> However, as Brezhnev had more than two hundred decorations, several were placed on each cushion.<ref name ="Pravda"/> Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.<ref name ="Pravda"/> 

[[Galina Brezhneva]], Brezhnev's disgraced daughter, was constantly followed by two burly guards.
