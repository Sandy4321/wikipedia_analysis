'''Eastern philosophy''' includes the various [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]], including [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Indian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]]. Sometimes [[Iranian philosophy|Iranian/Persian philosophy]] can be considered as eastern philosophy. Broadly speaking the term can also sometimes include [[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian philosophy]], [[Jewish philosophy]], and [[Islamic philosophy]], though these may also be considered [[Western philosophy|Western philosophies]].

==Classification==

Eastern philosophy includes the various philosophies of Asia, including Indian philosophy, Chinese philosophy, Iranian philosophy, Japanese philosophy, Korean philosophy, Vietnamese philosophy, Arab philosophy and Jewish philosophy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The division is not purely geographic but also stems from general hermeneutic and conceptual differences that lie between Eastern and Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Controversy==
Some Western thinkers claim that philosophy as such is only characteristic of Western cultures. [[Martin Heidegger]] is even reported to have said that only Greek and German languages are suitable for philosophizing {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. On the other hand, Arab and Jewish philosophy, which have been in dialogue with the Greek tradition and, in the case of leading Islamic philosophers such as [[Ibn Sina]] or [[Ibn Rushd]], rely heavily on it, are not specifically Eastern philosophies at all. It is still commonplace in Western universities to teach only Western philosophy and to ignore Asian philosophy altogether, or consider only newer Western-influenced Asian thought properly "philosophy". [[Carine Defoort]], herself a specialist in Chinese thought, has offered support for such a "family" view of philosophy,<ref>Defoort, Carine. (2001). "Is There Such a Thing as Chinese Philosophy? Arguments of an Implicit Debate",
''Philosophy East and West'' 
51 (3) 393<U+2013>413.</ref> while [[Rein Raud]] has presented an argument<ref>[[Rein Raud|Raud, Rein]]. (2006) "Philosophies versus Philosophy: In Defense of a Flexible Definition". ''Philosophy East & West'' 56 (4) 618<U+2013>625. [https://www.academia.edu/217793/Philosophies_vs_Philosophy_In_Defense_of_A_Flexible_Definition]</ref> against it and offered a more flexible definition of philosophy that would include both Western and Asian thought on equal terms. In response, [[OuYang Min]] argues that philosophy proper is a Western cultural practice and essentially different from ''zhexue'', which is what the Chinese have,<ref>OuYang Min. (2012). "There is No Need for ''Zhongguo Zhexue'' to be Philosophy" Asian Philosophy 22 (3) 199-223.</ref> even though ''zhexue'' (originally ''tetsugaku'') is actually a neologism coined in 1873 by [[Nishi Amane]] for describing Western philosophy as opposed to traditional Asian thought.<ref>Havens, Thomas R.H. (1970).''Nishi Amane and Modern Japanese Thought'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.50.</ref>

== Supreme God and the demigods ==
{{Conceptions of God|narrow}}
Some Eastern philosophies have formulated questions on the nature of [[God]] and its relationship to the universe based on [[Monotheism|Monotheistic]] framework within which it emerged. This has created a dichotomy among some Western philosophies, between secular philosophies and religious philosophies developed within the context of a particular monotheistic religion's [[dogma]]<U+2014>especially some creeds of [[Protestant]] Christianity, regarding the nature of God and the universe.

Eastern religions have been as concerned by questions relating to the nature of a single God as the universe's sole creator and ruler.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The distinction between the religious and the secular tends to be much less sharp in Eastern philosophy, and the same philosophical school often contains both religious and philosophical elements.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thus, some people accept the so-called [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] tenets of [[Buddhism]] without going to a temple and worshipping. Some have worshipped the [[Taoism|Taoist]] deities religiously without bothering to delve into the theological underpinnings, while others embrace the Taoist religion while ignoring the mythological aspects.

This arrangement stands in marked contrast to some recent philosophy in the West, which has traditionally enforced either a completely unified philosophic/religious belief system (for example, the various sects and associated philosophies of [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]]), or a sharp and total repudiation of some forms of religion by philosophy (for example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Voltaire]], etc.).

=== Comparative religion ===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}{{Original research|date=March 2011}}
A common thread that often differentiates Eastern philosophy from Western is the relationship {{Clarify|date=March 2011}}between the gods (or God) and the universe. Some Western schools of thought were [[animistic]] or [[pantheistic]], such as the classical Greek tradition, while later religious beliefs, influenced by the [[monotheism]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]], portrayed divinity as more [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]].

Much like the classical Greek philosophies, many Eastern schools of thought were more interested in explaining the natural world via universal patterns; without recourse to capricious agencies like gods (or God). [[Syncretism]] allowed various schools of thought such as [[Yi jing|Yi]], [[Yin and yang|Yin yang]], [[Wu xing]] and [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] to mutually complement one another without threatening [[Chinese folk religion|traditional religious practice]] or [[East Asian religions|new religious movements]].

=== Syntheses of Eastern and Western philosophy ===
{{Details3|[[Buddhism and Western Philosophy]], [[Perennial Philosophy]], and [[New Age]]}}
There have been many modern attempts to integrate Western and Eastern philosophical traditions.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] developed a philosophy that was essentially a synthesis of [[Hinduism]] with Western thought. He anticipated that the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' (primary [[Hindu]] scriptures) would have a much greater influence in the West than they have had. However, Schopenhauer was working with heavily flawed early translations (and sometimes second-degree translations), and many feel that he may not necessarily have accurately grasped the Eastern philosophies which interested him.

Recent attempts to incorporate Western philosophy into Eastern thought include the [[Kyoto School]] of philosophers, who combined the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Husserl]] with the insights of [[Zen Buddhism]]. [[Watsuji Tetsuro|Watsuji Tetsur<U+00F4>]], a 20th-century [[Japan]]ese philosopher attempted to combine the works of [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard]], Nietzsche, and Heidegger with Eastern philosophies. Some have claimed that there is also a definite eastern element within [[Heidegger]]'s philosophy. For the most part this is not made explicit within Heidegger's philosophy, apart from in the dialogue between a Japanese and inquirer. Heidegger did spend time attempting to translate the Tao Te Ching into German, working with his Chinese student Paul Hsaio. It has also been claimed that much of Heidegger's later philosophy, particularly the sacredness of Being, bears a distinct similarity to Taoist ideas. There are clear parallels between Heidegger and the work of Kyoto School, and ultimately, it may be read that Heidegger's philosophy is an attempt to 'turn eastwards' in response to the crisis in Western civilization. However, this is only an interpretation.

The 20th century [[Hindu]] [[guru]] [[Sri Aurobindo]] was influenced by [[German Idealism]] and his [[integral yoga]] is regarded as a synthesis of Eastern and Western thought. The German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Jean Gebser]]'s writings on the history of [[consciousness]] referred to a new planetary consciousness that would bridge this gap. Followers of these two authors are often grouped together under the term [[Integral thought]].

Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung]] was deeply influenced by the [[I Ching]]. The I Ching (Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese text from the Shang Dynasty (Bronze Age 1700BC-1050BC), and uses a system of Yin and Yang, which it places into hexagrams for the purposes of divination. Carl Jung's idea of [[synchronicity]] moves towards an Oriental view of [[causality]], as he states in the [http://www.iging.com/intro/foreword.htm foreword] to Richard Wilhelm's translation of the [[I Ching#Influence on Western culture|I Ching]] (Book of Changes). He explains that this Chinese view of the world is based not on science as the West knows it, but on chance.

==East Asian philosophies==
{{Main|Chinese philosophy|Japanese philosophy|Korean philosophy}}

=== Confucianism ===
{{Main|Confucianism}}
Confucianism(<U+5112><U+5B78>), developed around the teachings of [[Confucius]](<U+5B54><U+5B50>) and is based on a set of [[Chinese classic texts]].

=== Neo-Confucianism ===
{{Main|Neo-Confucianism}}
[[Neo-Confucianism]] is a later further development of [[Confucianism]] but also went much more differently from the origin of Confucianism. It started developing from the [[Song Dynasty]] and was nearly completed in late [[Ming Dynasty]]. Its root can be found as early as [[Tang Dynasty]], often attributed to scholar [[Tang Xie Tian]]. It has a great influence on the countries of [[East Asia]] including [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] as well as [[Vietnam]]. [[Zhu Xi]] is considered as the biggest master of [[Song Dynasty|Song]] where Neo-Confucianism and [[Wang Yangming]] is the one of [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]'s. But there are conflicts between Zhu's school and Wang's.

===Taoism===
{{Main|Taoism}}
Taoism (or Daoism) is traditionally contrasted with [[Confucianism]] in [[China]]. Taoism's central books are the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' (''Tao-Te-Ching''), traditionally attributed to Laozi (Lao Tzu), and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (''Chuang Tzu'').

===Shinto===
{{Main|Shinto}}
Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan. It is a sophisticated form of [[animism]] that holds that spirits called [[kami]] inhabit all things. Worship is at public shrines or in small shrines constructed in one's home.  According to Shinto practice, relationship with the kami that inhabit this world is foremost in a person's duties; the kami are to be respected so that they may return our respect.  Shinto further holds that the "spirit" and "mundane" worlds are one and the same.  Of all of the tenets of this philosophy, purity is the most highly stressed. Pure acts are those that promote or contribute to the harmony of the universe, and impure acts are those that are deleterious in this regard.  As a faith, Shinto is heavily influenced by Chinese religions, notably Taoism and Buddhism.

=== Legalism ===
{{Main|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
Legalism advocated a strict interpretation of the law in every respect. No judgment calls. Morality was not important {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}; adherence to the letter of the law was paramount.

=== Maoism ===
{{Main|Maoism}}
Maoism is a [[Communist]] philosophy based on the teachings of 20th century [[Communist Party of China]] revolutionary leader [[Mao Zedong]]. It is based partially on earlier theories by Marx and Lenin, but rejects the urban [[proletariat]] and [[Leninism|Leninist]] emphasis on heavy industrialization in favor of a revolution supported by the peasantry, and a decentralized agrarian economy based on many collectively worked farms.

===Hindu philosophy===
{{Main|Hindu philosophy}}
Hinduism (<U+0938><U+0928><U+093E><U+0924><U+0928> <U+0927><U+0930><U+094D><U+092E>; ''San<U+0101>tana Dharma'', roughly Perennial [[Moral]] [[Duty]]) is the oldest [[major world religions]]. Hinduism is characterized by a diverse array of [[religious belief]] systems, practices and scriptures. It has its origin in ancient [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] culture at least as far back as [[1500 BC]]. It is the third largest religion with approximately 1.05 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] followers worldwide, 96% of whom live in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Hinduism rests on the spiritual bedrock of the [[Vedas]], hence Veda [[Dharma]], and their mystic issue, the [[Upanishads]], as well as the teachings of many great Hindu [[guru]]s through the ages. Many streams of thought flow from the six Vedic/Hindu [[Hindu philosophy|schools]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti]] sects and [[Tantra]] [[<U+0100>gama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] schools into the one ocean of Hinduism, the first of the [[Dharma]] religions. Also, the sacred book [[Bhagavad Gita]] is one of the most revered texts among Hindus.

What can be said to be common to many theistic Hindus is belief in [[Dharma]], [[reincarnation]], [[karma]], and [[moksha]] (liberation) of every [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] through a variety of moral, action-based, and [[meditative]] [[yoga]]s. Still more fundamental principles include [[ahimsa]] (non-violence), the primacy of the [[Guru]], the [[Divinity|Divine]] Word of [[Om|Aum]] and the power of [[mantra]]s, love of [[Truth]] in many manifestations as [[god]]s and [[goddess]]es, and an understanding that the essential spark of the Divine ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) is in every human and living being, thus allowing for many spiritual paths leading to the [[One Unitary Religious Truth]] (which Hindus call [[Brahman]]). This acceptance of various paths leading to the same truth, is also a foundation of Hindu philosophy. However, since the term Hindu is more of an umbrella term for the [[Indian religions]], there may be persons who believe in none of the above concepts and yet consider themselves Hindu.

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy}}
Buddhism is a system of religious beliefs based on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]]. Buddhism is a non-theistic religion, one whose tenets are not especially concerned with the existence or non-existence of a God or gods. The Buddha himself expressly disavowed any special divine status or inspiration, and said that anyone, anywhere could achieve all the insight that he had. The question of God is largely irrelevant in Buddhism, though some sects (notably [[Tibetan Buddhism]]) do [[veneration|venerate]] a number of gods drawn in from local indigenous belief systems yet this practice has taken on different meanings and has become a skillful mean within the Tibetan Buddhist practice.

Buddhist philosophy has its foundations in the doctrines of:
* [[Anatta]], which specifies that all is without substantial [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] identity
* [[Pratitya-samutpada]], which delineates the Buddhist concept of [[causality]]
* Buddhist [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] analysis of [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]], or phenomenological constituents

Most Buddhist sects believe in [[karma]], a cause-and-effect relationship between all that has been done and all that will be done. Events that occur are held to be the direct result of previous events. One effect of karma is rebirth. At death, the karma from a given life determines the nature of the next life's existence. The ultimate goal of a Buddhist practitioner is to eliminate karma (both good and bad), end the cycle of rebirth and suffering, and attain [[Nirvana]], usually translated as  ''awakening'' or ''enlightenment.''

===Sikh philosophy===
{{Main|Sikh religious philosophy}}
[[File:Sikhi1.svg|thumb|Diagram showing some of the important Sikh beliefs.]]
* ''[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]'' and ''[[Selfless service|Sewa]]'' - These are the Foundation of [[Sikhism]]. It is the duty of every [[Sikh]] to practise ''[[Naam]] Simran'' ([[meditation]] on the Lord's name) daily and engage in ''Sewa'' (Selfless Service) whenever there is a possibility, in ''[[Gurdwara]]'' (Sikh place of worship), in community centres, old people's homes, care centres, major world disasters, etc. "Ek ong kar Satanam" and "Waheguru" are some mantras used for this purpose. "Ek ong kar  Satanam" roughly translates to "there is one God un-separate from nature and truth is its name". "Waheguru" is used as a meditative practice on the Lord's name.
* The [[Three pillars of Sikhism|Three Pillars]] of Sikhism - [[Guru Nanak]] formalised these three important pillars of Sikhism.
** ''[[Naam Japna]]'' <U+2013> A Sikh is to engage in a daily practise of meditation and ''[[Nitnem]]'' (a daily prayer routine) by reciting and chanting of God<U+2019>s Name.
** ''[[Kirat Karni]]'' - To live honestly and earn by ones physical and mental effort while accepting Gods gifts and blessings. A Sikh has to live as a householders carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities to the full.
** ''[[Vand Chakna]]'' - Sikhs are asked to share their wealth within the community and outside by giving ''[[Dasvand]]'' and practising charity (''Daan''). To <U+201C>Share and consume together<U+201D>.
* Kill the [[Five Thieves]] - The [[Sikh Gurus]] tell us that our mind and spirit are constantly being attacked by the Five Evils <U+2013> ''[[Kam]]'' (Lust), ''[[Krodh]]'' (Rage), ''[[Lobh]]'' (Greed), ''[[Moh]]'' (Attachment) and ''[[Ahankar]]'' (Ego). A Sikh needs to constantly attack and overcome these five vices; be always vigilant and on guard to tackle these five thieves all the time.
* Positive Human Qualities - The Sikh Gurus taught the Sikhs to develop and harness positive human qualities that lead the soul closer to God and away from evil. These are ''[[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]]'' (Truth), ''[[Daya]]'' (Compassion), ''[[Santokh]]'' (Contentment), ''[[Nimrata]]'' (Humility) and ''[[Pyare]]'' (Love).

===Jainism===

Throughout its history, the Jain philosophy remained unified and single, although as a religion, Jainism was divided into various sects and traditions. The contribution of Jain philosophy in developing the Indian philosophy has been significant. Jain philosophical concepts like [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]], [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksa]], [[Samsara (Jainism)|Samsara]] and the like are common with other [[Indian religions]] like [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in various forms.<ref  Name= "Zydenbos">{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first =Robert J. | authorlink =Robert_J._Zydenbos | title =Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher =Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location =M<U+00FC>nchen | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html }}</ref> While Jainism traces its philosophy from teachings of [[Mahavira]] and other [[Tirthankara]]s, various Jain philosophers from [[Kundakunda]] and [[Umasvati]] in ancient times to {{IAST|[[Yasovijaya|Ya<U+015B>ovijaya Ga<U+1E47>i]]}} in recent times have contributed greatly in developing and refining the Jain and Indian philosophical concepts.

It proposed a system of ethics based on rational thought. However, this school has been dead for more than a thousand years.

==Iranian philosophy==

===Zoroastrianism===
{{Main|Zoroastrianism}}
Zoroastrianism is a [[monotheistic]] religion, which originated in [[Iran]]. It has a dualistic nature ([[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]]), with an additional series of six important divine entities called the [[Amesha Spentas]].<ref>Mary Boyce: "The Origins of Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy". Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.</ref> In modern Zoroastrianism they are interpreted as aspects or emanations of Ahura Mazda (the Supreme Being), who form a heptad that is good and constructive. They are opposed to another group of seven who are evil and destructive. It is this persistent conflict between good and evil that distinguishes Zoroastrianism from monotheistic frameworks that have only one power as supreme. By requiring its adherents to have faith and belief in ''equally opposing'' powers Zoroastrianism characterizes itself as dualistic.

The teachings of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (Zoroaster) appeared in [[Persia]] at some point during the period 1700-1800 BCE.<ref name="Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani">{{cite journal |title=Zarathushtra, Mazdayasna and Governance|author=Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani}}</ref><ref name="Whitley">{{cite journal |title=The Date and Teaching of Zarathustra|author=Whitley, C.F.|pages=219<U+2013>223|journal=Numen|volume= 4|issue=3|date=Sep 1957|doi=10.2307/3269345}}</ref> His wisdom became the basis of the religion [[Zoroastrianism]], and generally influenced the development of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] branch of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] philosophy.

Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.</ref> He is also believed to be one of the oldest [[monotheism|monotheists]] in the history of religion. He espoused an ethical philosophy based on the primacy of ''good thoughts (pendar-e-nik), good words (goftar-e-nik), and good deeds (kerdar-e-nik).''<ref>Philip G. Kreyenbroek: "Morals and Society in Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy". Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.</ref>

The works of Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism had a significant influence on [[Greek philosophy]] and [[History of Western philosophy|Roman philosophy]]. Several [[ancient Greek]] writers such as  [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and [[Latin]] writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] praised Zoroastrian philosophy as "the most famous and most useful". [[Plato]] learnt of Zoroastrian philosophy through Eudoxus and incorporated much of it into his own [[Platonic realism]].<ref>A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr.

===Manichaeism===
[[Manichaeism]], founded by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], was influential from [[North Africa]] in the West, to [[China]] in the East. Its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism, which he passionately denounced in his writings, and whose writings continue to be influential among Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox [[theology|theologians]]. An important principle of Manichaeism was its [[dualism|dualistic]] nature.

===Mazdakism===
The religious and philosophical teaching called [[Mazdak]]ism, which its founder, Mazdak, regarded as a reformed and purified version of [[Zoroastrianism]]<ref name=ya56>Yarshater, Ehsan. 1983. The Cambridge history of Iran, volume 2. p.995-997</ref><ref name=cosmo>[http://azargoshnasp.net/famous/babak_khorramdin/teachingsmazdakshaki.pdf Shaki, Mansour. 1985.

===Zurvanism===
[[Zurvanism]] is characterized by the element of its ''first principle'', which is time (''Zurvan''), as a primordial creator. According to Zaehner, Zurvanism appears to have three schools of thought, all with classical Zurvanism as a foundation: ''aesthetic'', ''materialist'', and ''fatalistic''.

====Aesthetic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Aesthetic Zurvanism|Aesthetic Zurvanism]]<U+2014>apparently not as popular as the ''materialistic'' kind<U+2014>viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated time, which, under the influence of desire, divided ''reason'' (a male principle) and ''concupiscence'' (a female principle).

====Materialist Zurvanism====
While Zoroaster's [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]] created the universe with his thought, [[Zurvanism#Materialist Zurvanism|materialist Zurvanism]] challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing.

====Fatalistic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Fatalistic Zurvanism|Fatalistic Zurvanism]] resulted from the doctrine of limited time with the implication that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe and that the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. According to the [[Middle Persian]] work [[Menog-i Khrad]]: "[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets."

===Avicennism===
The Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] wrote almost 450 treatises on a wide range of subjects. Many philosophical works, among them [[The Book of Healing]], have survived.

===Iranian Illuminationism===
The [[Illuminationism#Iranian school of Illuminationism|Philosophy of Illumination]] founded by [[Sohrevardi]] argued that light operates at all levels and hierarchies of reality. Light produces immaterial and substantial lights, including immaterial intellects, human and animal souls and even 'dusky substances', such as bodies. Sohrevardi's works display extensive developments on the basis of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas and ancient Iranian thought.

===Transcendent Philosophy===
[[Transcendent Philosophy]], developed by [[Mulla Sadra|Sadr Shirazi]], is one of two main disciplines of [[Islamic philosophy]] that is currently live and active.

The origins of [[Babylonia]]n philosophy, in the popular sense of the word, can be traced back to the [[wisdom]] of early [[Mesopotamia]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialog]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. The [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] of the Babylonians developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47.</ref>

It is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on [[Greek philosophy]], and later [[Hellenistic philosophy]], however the textual evidence is lacking. The undated Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agnost]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]] and Plato.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47 [43].</ref> The [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also said to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.

==Islamic philosophy==
{{Main|Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy|Modern Islamic philosophy}}
The rise of [[Islam]] and the influence of classical Greek thought, especially Aristotle, led to the emergence of various philosophical schools of thought. Amongst them [[Sufism]] established esoteric philosophy, [[Mu'tazili]] (partly influenced by [[Hellenistic philosophy]]) reconstructed [[rationalism]], while [[Ash'ari]] reshaped logical and rational interpretation of [[God]], [[justice]], [[destiny]] and the [[universe]].

Early Islamic philosophy was influenced by (ancient) [[Greek philosophy]], [[Hellenistic philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Indian philosophy]], and in turn, Islamic philosophy had a strong influence on (medieval) [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Christian philosophy]]/[[Western philosophy]], Iranian philosophy and Indian philosophy, hence many consider Islamic philosophy to be both an Eastern philosophy and a Western philosophy.

Al-Mu'tazilah (<U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0639><U+062A><U+0632><U+0644><U+0629>) or [[Mu'tazili]]te is a popular theological school of [[philosophy]] during early Islam. They called themselves '''Ahl al-'Adl wa al-Tawhid''' ("People of Justice and Monotheism"). They ascended dramatically during 8th and 9th century due to the support of intellectuals and elites. Later in the 13th century, they lost official support in favour of the rising [[Ash'ari]] school. Most of their valuable works were destroyed during the [[Crusades]] and [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol invasion]].

One of the most influential Muslim philosophers in the West was [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy.<ref>Majid Fakhry (2001). ''Averroes: His Life, Works and Influence''. Oneworld Publications. ISBN 1-85168-269-4.</ref>

It is said that other influential Muslim philosophers include [[al-Jahiz]], a pioneer of [[evolution]]ary thought and [[natural selection]]; [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), a pioneer of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the [[philosophy of science]] and a critic of [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] and [[Aristotle]]'s concept of place ([[topos]]); [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]], a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy; [[Avicenna]], a critic of [[Aristotelian logic]]; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], a critic of Aristotelian logic and a pioneer of [[inductive logic]]; and [[Ibn Khaldun]], considered the father of the [[philosophy of history]] and [[sociology]] and a pioneer of [[social philosophy]]. However, not very much credible evidence to support such claims is forthcoming, at least in the field of Arabic-English translation methodology, with regards to the exact sciences of semantics and hermeneutics.

=== Sufi philosophy ===
{{Main|Sufi philosophy}}
[[Sufism]] (<U+062A><U+0635><U+0648><U+0641> {{unicode|ta<U+1E63>awwuf}}) is a school of [[esoteric]] philosophy in [[Islam]], which is based on the pursuit of [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[truth]] as a definite goal to attain. To attain this supreme truth, Sufism has marked ''Lataif-e-Sitta'' (the six subtleties), ''Nafs'', ''Qalb'', ''Sirr'', ''Ruh'' ([[spirit]]), ''Khafi'' and ''Akhfa''. Apart from conventional religious practices, they also perform Muraqaba ([[meditation]]), Dhikr (Zikr or recitation), Chillakashi ([[asceticism]]) and Sama ([[esoteric]] [[music]] and [[dance]]).
