The '''South side''' is a major part of the city of [[Chicago]], located in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].  Much of it has evolved from the incorporation of independent townships, such as [[Hyde Park Township]], into the city. The south side has had a distinct identity which is often associated with racial diversity.<ref name=EoCSS/> The boundaries of the region vary by source but, generally the area encompasses roughly 60% of the city's land area with a higher ratio of single-family homes and large sections zoned for industry. Considerable heterogeneity in race, income and other demographic measures can be found there.

Although it has endured a reputation as being poverty-stricken and crime-infested, the reality is more varied, and it ranges from impoverished to [[working class]] to affluent.<ref name=SSUCH>{{cite web

Neighborhoods such as [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]], [[New City, Chicago|Back of the Yards]], [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]], [[South Lawndale, Chicago|Little Village]] and [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] tend to be more blue collar, while the Jackson Park Highlands, [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], [[Mount Greenwood, Chicago|Mount Greenwood]], [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]] and [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] tend to have more middle, upper-middle and higher incomes.

The south side is serviced by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] via [[buses]] and the [[Chicago 'L']], and a number of [[Metra]] lines.  The south side is also served by several [[Interstate highway]]s as well as [[United States highway]].

==Boundaries==
[[Image:Black chicago1.gif|thumb|300px|left|The [[African American|black]] population of Chicago]]
The south side of Chicago was originally defined as the portion of the city south of the [[Chicago River]].<ref name=Encarta>{{cite web

[[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Indiana]] state line border provide enduring eastern lines of demarcation, and the evolving city limits have provided a fairly uncontested southern border.

===Subdivisions===
Following mostly [[Racial segregation|racial]] lines, the South Side is further divided into a White and Hispanic southwest side, a largely black south side, and a smaller, more racially diverse southeast side centered on the [[East Side, Chicago|East Side]] (#52) community area, and including the adjacent community areas of [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago]] (#46), [[South Deering, Chicago|South Deering]] (#51), and [[Hegewisch, Chicago|Hegewisch]] (#55).<ref name=NEIUses>{{cite web|url=http://www.neiu.edu/~reseller/sesidewlcme.html|title=Chicago's Southeast Side|date=2007|publisher=Northeastern Illinois University|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> The contentions about the boundary of the South and Southwest sides are due to a lack of a meaningful natural or artificial dividing marker. However, one source opines that the boundary is best defined as the railroad tracks east of [[Western Avenue]].<ref name=EoCSS/> 

[[Image:Midway conections.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[Midway Airport]] connects the South Side to the nation and the world.]]
====Southwest side====
The southwest side of Chicago is a subsection of the south side comprising mainly residential neighborhoods, and mainly defined by the distinguishing feature of being predominantly white.  Architecturally, the southwest side is distinguished by the tract of Chicago's [[Bungalow Belt]], which runs through it.

[[Archer Heights, Chicago|Archer Heights]], a [[Polish American|Polish]] enclave along [[Archer Avenue, Chicago|Archer Avenue]] (which leads toward [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]]), is located on the southwest side of the city, as is [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]], which is home to a large concentration of [[Irish American]]s and boasts its annual [[South Side Irish Parade]], which typically draws a larger crowd than the [[St. Patrick's Day parade]] in Chicago's Loop.  In fact, the parade is said to be the largest Irish Neighborhood St. Patrick's celebration in the world outside of [[Dublin, Ireland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200203/ai_mark03039308|accessdate=2007-09-27|month=March|year=2002|publisher=FindArticles|work=Market Wire|title=South Side Irish Parade Expected To Draw Record Crowd}}</ref> and it is broadcast live as well as replayed with an encore presentation on Chicago's [[CBS]] [[Affiliate network]] [[television station]], [[WBBM-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_070112246.html|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=Pray, Parade and Party At South Side Irish Parade|author=Puccinelli, Mike|publisher=CBS Broadcasting, Inc.}}</ref>  The southwest side is also home to the largest concentration of [[G<U+00F3>ral]]s, ([[Carpathian mountains|Carpathian]] highlanders) outside of [[Europe]]; it is the location of the [[Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America]].

[[Image:Chicago Olympics 2016.jpg|160px|thumb|right|The South Side has a prominent role in the [[Chicago 2016 Olympic bid]].]]

==Athletics==
The South Side hosts the [[Major League Baseball]] [[American League]] [[Chicago White Sox]] at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in the [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] and the [[National Football League]] [[Chicago Bears]] at [[Soldier Field]] in the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] community area.

===2016 Olympic bid===
{{main article|Chicago 2016 Olympic bid}}
The South side will play a prominent role in the city of Chicago's bid for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].  The [[Olympic Village]] is planned in the [[Douglas, Chicago|Douglas]] community area across [[Lake Shore Drive]] from [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]].<ref name=CB20070414>{{cite news|url=http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=24588&bt=Olympic+Bid&arc=n&searchType=all|accessdate=2007-09-27|date=2007-04-14|title=USOC picks Chicago for 2016 Olympic bid|author=Hinz, Greg|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|work=ChicagoBusiness}}</ref>  In addition, the [[Olympic Stadium]] is expected to be located in the [[Chicago Park District]]'s [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] located in the [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]] community area.<ref name=CB20070123a>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=23589|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=Glitz, guarantees added to Olympic bid|author=Hinz, Greg|date=2007-01-23|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|work=ChicagoBusiness}}</ref>  Many Olympic events will also be hosted throughout the south side if the plan succeeds.

==History==
===Prostitution===
Chicago's reputation for political corruption stems from tolerance of vices such as [[prostitution]]. Early prostitution occurred in the [[central business district]]. However, the disreputables were eventually pushed to the south side, creating the [[Levee]], one of the nation's most infamous sex districts. Although [[Chicago Mayor]] [[Carter Harrison II]] closed the Levee in 1912 and much of the trade moved to the suburbs, nightclubs on the south side had an ample supply of prostitutes.<ref name=EoCPros>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1015.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Prostitution|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Blair, Cynthia M.}}</ref> Among those who cared for and rehabilitated persons charged with prostitution were a small group of the [[Good Shepherd Sisters]] who eventually became the first [[nun]]s to serve African Americans on Chicago's south side.<ref name=EoCHotGS>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/606.html|title=House of the Good Shepherd / Chicago Industrial School for Girls|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Hoy, Suellen|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Livestock chicago 1947.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Union Stock Yards]], 1941]]
===Demographics===
With its factories, steel mills, and [[meat packing industry|meat-packing]] plants, the south side saw a sustained period of immigration which began around the 1860s, and continued through the [[World War II|Second World War]]. [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] immigrants in particular, settled in neighborhoods adjacent to industrial zones. African Americans resided in [[Bronzeville]] (around 35th and State Streets), in an area called "the black belt", later spreading across the south side after World War II. The Black Belt, which gave a new meaning to the term [[ghetto]], arose from discriminatory real estate practices and the threat of violence in nearby white neighborhoods.<ref name=EoCG>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/514.html|title=Ghettoization|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Bennett, Larry|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

Post [[reconstruction]] black southerners migrated to Chicago in large numbers and caused the African American population to nearly quadruple from 4,000 to 15,000 between 1870 and 1890.<ref name=EoCAA>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/27.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=African Americans|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Manning, Christopher}}</ref>  The population was concentrated on the south side. The migration continued into the 20th century when the Black population reached 40,000 by 1910, with 78% residing in the south side's "Black Belt", which extended for 30 blocks along [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] and was only a few blocks wide.<ref name=EoCAA/> The migration of blacks to Chicago's south side led to a [[white flight]].<ref name=EoCOL>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/916.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Oak Lawn, IL|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Gurlacz, Betsy}}</ref>

White flight from the south side resulted in a high remaining percentage of African Americans. Most neighborhoods south of 55th Street are predominantly black with a large [[Mexican American]] population residing in Little Village (South Lawndale) and areas south of 99th Street. The South Side has had a history of [[racial segregation]]. One factor was the construction of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] which separated some white neighborhoods from black neighborhoods (e.g. the divide between Bridgeport and [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]]). Progress gained momentum with the historic redevelopment of Bronzeville and [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]]. Many of the [[Chicago Housing Authority]]'s massive public housing projects, which lined several miles of south State Street, have been torn down. After decades of sustaining some of the poorest housing conditions in the United States, the CHA has begun replacing the old high-rise public housing with mixed-income, lower-density developments, known as the Plan for Transformation.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Neighborhood rehabilitation (and, in some cases, gentrification) can also be seen in parts of [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] and Bronzeville, as well as in Bridgeport and [[McKinley Park, Chicago|McKinley Park]]. Historic [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]]'s redevelopment is another example of a work in progress. [[Chinatown, Chicago|Chinatown]], which has seen a surge in growth and has become an increasingly popular destination for both tourists and locals alike, is a cornerstone of the city's [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] community. Hyde Park is home to the [[University of Chicago]] as well as the South Side's largest [[Jew]]ish population, which is centered around Chicago's oldest [[synagogue]], [[KAM Isaiah Israel]].  During the 1920's and 1930's much of the South side was a hotbed of legal debate with cases such as [[Hansberry v. Lee]], {{ussc|311|32|1940}}, rising to the [[U. S. Supreme Court]] in the [[Washington Park Subdivision]].

Gangs have been prominent on the south side for over a century. By the 1960s, gangs such as the [[Vice Lords]] began to improve their public image, moving from thuggish ventures to procuring government and private grants. By 2000, gangs crossed gender lines to include about a 20% female composition.<ref name=EoCG>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/497.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Gangs|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Diamond, Andrew J.}}</ref>

===Arts===
Chicago's African American community, which was concentrated on the south side, experienced an artistic movement following the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in [[New York City]]. From the 1930s until the 1950s, the movement was concentrated in and around the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] and included [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[Margaret Burroughs]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[Eldzier Cortor]], [[Gordon Parks]], and [[Richard Wright]].<ref name=EoCA>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/72.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Art|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Warren, Lynne}}</ref> Other Chicago Black Renaissance artists included [[Willard Motley]], [[William Attaway]], [[Frank Marshall Davis]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton]] exemplified the new intellectual style in ''[[Black Metropolis]]'', an enduring depiction of 1930s and 1940s urban ghetto Chicago life.<ref name=EoCAA/> In 1961, Burroughs founded the [[DuSable Museum]] and by the late 60s the South Side had a resurgent art movement led by [[Jim Nutt]], [[Gladys Nilsson]] and [[Karl Wirsum]] who became known as the [[Chicago Imagists]].

Music in Chicago flourished because labels with studios in New York City or [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] only kept regional distribution offices in Chicago, which created a vacuum for many independent labels.<ref name=EoCRP>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1048.html|accessdate=2007-08-13|title=Record Publishing|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Clague, Mark}}</ref> In 1948, [[Blues]] was introduced by [[Aristocrat Records]] (later [[Chess Records]]) and [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Chess Records]] quickly followed with [[Little Walker]], [[Jimmy Rogers]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name=EoCAA/><ref name=EoCRaB/> Vee-Jay, the largest black owned label before [[Motown Records]], was among the post-World War II companies that formed "Record Row" on Cottage Grove between 47th and 50th Streets and later (in the 1960s) along South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].<ref name=EoCRP/><ref name=EoCRaB>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1070.html|accessdate=2007-08-13|title=Rhythm and Blues|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Pruter, Robert}}</ref> [[Rhythm and blues]] continued to thrive after Record Row became the hub of gospelized R&B, known as soul. Chicago continues as a prominent city for musical contribution.<ref name=EoCRaB/>

Many other artists have left their mark on Chicago's south side. These include [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[James Farrell]] via [[fiction writing|fiction]], [[Archibald Motley, Jr.]] via [[painting]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Lorado Taft]] via [[sculpture]], and [[Thomas Dorsey]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]] via [[gospel music]].<ref name=EoCSS/>

[[Image:MidwayView1.JPG|right|160px|thumb|The Midway at the [[University of Chicago]]]]
===Socioeconomics===
Much of the south side has evolved from speculative investments. [[Stephen A. Douglas]], [[Paul Cornell (lawyer)|Paul Cornell]], [[George Pullman]] and various business entities have developed South Chicago real estate. The [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman District]], a company town, [[Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hyde Park Township]], various platted communities and subdivisions were the results of such efforts.<ref name=EoCRE>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1045.html|title=Real Estate|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=deVise, Pierre|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> By the 1930s, Chicago boasted a composition which included over 25% residential structures less than 10 years old, many of which were [[bungalow]]s. These continued to be built in the working-class south side into the 1960s.<ref name=EoCB>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/186.html|title=Bungalows|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Bigott, Joseph C.|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref><ref name=EoCBB>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1408.html|title=Bungalow Belt|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Keating, Ann Durkin|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> [[Kitchenette]]s, often including [[Murphy bed]]s and [[Pullman kitchen]]s, also composed a large part of the housing supply during and after the [[Great Depression]], especially in the Black Belt.<ref name=EoK>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/692.html|accessdate=2007-08-13|title=Kitchenettes|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author= Plotkin, Wendy}}</ref> Chicago's south side had a history of [[philanthropist|philanthropic]] subsidized housing dating back to 1919.<ref name=EoCSH>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1215.html|accessdate=2007-08-13|title=Subsidized Housing|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author= Bowly, Jr., Devereux}}</ref> However, in 1949 the [[United States Congress]] passed the Housing Act to fund public housing.  The CHA produced a plan of citywide projects that was rejected by white aldermen on the [[Chicago City Council]] who rejected public housing in their wards.

With the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of Chicago Lab School]], the South side boasts some elite educational institutions.  The University hosts one of the nation's best medical centers at [[University of Chicago Hospitals]].  The south side also hosts its share of community colleges such as [[Olive-Harvey College]], [[Kennedy-King College]] and more modest educational institutions such as [[Chicago State University]] and the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].

==Transportation==
The South side is connected to the rest of the city by [[mass transit]] as well as major roads and highways.  In addition, [[Midway International Airport]] is located on the south side which connects the south side to the world.  Among the highways through the south side are [[Interstate 94 in Illinois|I-94]] (which goes by the names of [[Dan Ryan Expressway]], [[Bishop Ford Freeway]], [[Kingery Expressway]]), [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|I-90]], [[Interstate 57 in Illinois|I-57]], [[Interstate 55 in Illinois|I-55]] [[U.S. Route 12 in Illinois|U.S. 12]], [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. 20]], [[U.S. Route 41 in Illinois|U.S. 41]] and the [[Chicago Skyway]].  Several [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) bus and train lines and [[Metra]] train lines link the South Side to the city.  The south side is serviced by the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]] and [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]] lines of the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]], and the [[Rock Island District]], [[Metra Electric Line|Metra Electric]], and [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore]] [[Metra]] lines and a few stops on  the [[SouthWest Service]] Metra line.  In addition to standard local metropolitan bus service by the CTA, several South Side CTA express service bus routes connect the South Side to the city by running without stops along [[Lake Shore Drive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/maps/2007C.html|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|title=Central System Map}}</ref>

==Parks==
Today, the south side boasts many large parks that are part of the legacy of Paul Cornell and his service on the South Parks Commission. [[Chicago Park District]] parks serving the south side include [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]], [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]], [[Midway Plaisance]] and [[Harold Washington Park]].  The parks of Chicago foster and host tremendous amounts of athletic activities.  In addition, several events cause the closure of parts of [[Lake Shore Drive]].  Although the [[Chicago Marathon]] causes many roads to be closed in its route that goes as far north as [[Wrigleyville]] and to [[Bronzeville]] on the South side it does not cause any closures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/uploadedFiles/Chicago_Marathon/Runner_Information/07_Course_Map_Vert_CMYK.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon 2007 Course Map|publisher=chicagomarathon.com}}</ref> However, on the south side, the Chicago Half Marathon necessitates closures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohalfmarathon.com/|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Devine Sports|title=The Chicago Half Marathon}}</ref> and the entire drive is closed for [[Bike The Drive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikethedrive.org/|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=Bank America Bike The Drive|publisher=Chicagoland Bicycle Federation}}</ref>

==References in popular culture==
The south side's gritty reputation often makes its way into popular culture. The opening lines of [[Jim Croce]]'s song "[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]" state that the south side is "the baddest part of town." [[Richard Wright]]'s novel ''[[Native Son]]'' takes place on the south side and focuses on the plight of African Americans in the ghetto, including the housing practices that created such slums.

''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'' and parts of ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' take place in the south side. [[David Auburn]]'s play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]]'' takes place exclusively in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood; the [[Proof (2005 film)|film adaptation]] expands the setting.
