'''Justin Suarez''' is a fictional character on the [[United States|American]] [[comedy-drama]] series ''[[Ugly Betty]]''. He is portrayed by actor [[Mark Indelicato]].

==History==
===Season One===
Justin lives with his mother [[Hilda Suarez|Hilda]], [[Betty Suarez|Aunt Betty]], and his [[Ignacio Suarez|grandfather, Ignacio]]. While Hilda tries to convince Betty to try a line of work other than the fashion industry, Justin supports Betty and convinces her to continue and pursue her dreams.

Justin is quite fashion conscious and exhibits model-like behavior, such as commenting on his  own body image and being food conscious. This behavior concerns Hilda, who would rather see Justin act more like a "normal" boy; however, in the episode "[[Lose the Boss]]" his mother says to Justin's father Santos, "He's comfortable with who he is and so am I."

Justin has an interest in performing arts and home economics. He is a fan of ''Fashion TV'' and idolizes [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Gene Kelly]]. His knowledge about the fashion industry, from reading ''MODE'' and watching ''Fashion TV,'' is one of the reasons his aunt influences him.

On the subway as he, Hilda, and [[Santos (Ugly Betty)|Santos]] are to see ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', Justin sings the opening number "Good Morning Baltimore" to the audience of the subway, meant towards Santos to tell him all about the show. One passenger calls him a [[homosexual|fairy]], much to the anger of Santos.

In the Season 1 finale, Justin plays Tony in his school's production of ''[[West Side Story]]''; he won the role after putting walnuts in his sandwich that he gave to the actual lead after Justin learned that he had an [[allergy]] to products that contain nuts. As he is on stage, Justin sings the interludes while everyone's story temporarily concludes the season. As he dies on stage, Santos, his father, is shot and killed during a hold-up at a convenience store.
===Season Two===
Three weeks after his father's death, Justin is bored with summer camp so he sneaks into the Meade Publications building to spy on Mode. After he is caught, Betty arranges for him to become an intern for a few weeks before school as an alternative to summer camp. However, his enthusiasm of being an intern has already caused a unusual ripple effect for the Suarezes,  as he told Marc, who was training him, everything about their family, resulting in Betty giving in to Wilhelmina in exchange for getting Ignacio back to the United States, while the thoughts of his late father has begun to settle in after he visits the store where he was shot.  After the clerk told him that Santos was a hero and that he must be just like him, Justin told him that he wasn't like his father.  When Justin returned home, he chose his father's basketball for the one keepsake he would retain, and made a change in personality.  He had affected a contempt for his old interests, stopped getting good grades, skipping school, hanging out with thugs, and has been shown drinking beer and making out with a girl in efforts to adopt a more "macho" image. This all comes to a head after Justin is arrested for stealing and crashing Hilda's car. Hilda decides that its time to confront him and Justin finally realizes that he was spiraling out of control and if he didn<U+2019>t stop that he could end up being no different than the thug who killed his father.
===Season Three===
Early on in the third season, Justin clashes with a bully at school. When Justin tries out for a Broadway musical, he is shocked to find that the bully, [[Randy (Ugly Betty)|Randy]], is also trying out. They are still hostile and competitive with one another at first; but when they both don't get hired, they start to bond.

==Personal life==
The character of Justin has been the subject of much media speculation concerning his sexuality, although there has been no definitive statement on the subject either on the show or from the [[show runner]]s.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-betty31jan31,1,5019000.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews]</ref><ref> [http://usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-02-07-mark-indelicato_x.htm]</ref><ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601766.html]</ref><ref> [http://advocate.com/currentstory1_w_ektid38655.asp]</ref><ref> [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Just+Justin-a0156363219]</ref> If he is [[gay]], Justin would be one of the youngest gay characters ever presented on a [[prime time]] [[television]] program in the US. A February 2007 piece in ''[[USA Today]]'' said on the subject,

{{cquote|Justin's sexuality has never been addressed on the show, but ''Betty'' creator [[Silvio Horta]], who is gay and [[coming out|came out]] to his Cuban-American family at age 19, says the character will experience "the journey" as he matures. "I see myself in him," Horta says. "Growing up, I certainly felt like an outsider at times. But there's this sweet innocence in Justin that sees the positive."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-02-07-mark-indelicato_x.htm Indelicato gives bite to 'Betty' - USATODAY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

Horta later commented more definitively on Justin's sexuality, saying, "[Justin]'s twelve and we want to let things proceed as they would normally. There's so much to explore with this kid as he comes into adolescence and what it would be like if he were gay...which he probably is." <ref>[http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2007/07/happy_birthday_tomark_indelica.html Out in Hollywood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Indelicato has said about Justin, "My fan mail is mostly kids, especially kids that don't really fit in and people don't really understand them. They go, 'Thank you, because you're helping me to be understood by my peers,' and anybody else who doesn't understand them."<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-betty31jan31,1,5019000.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews Just the way you are - Los Angeles Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
But he also avoids websites, forums and blogs because of the negative feedback and remarks made towards his character on the show.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Ana Ortiz, who plays Hilda, said "One of my absolute favorite character traits of Hilda is that she feels that as long as he's happy, I'm happy. I'm not going to change him, I'm not going to judge him. He's happy. How many people can say they have a happy, well-adjusted kid? Not many. So she's like, 'If it's not broke.'"<ref>[http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2007/08/ugly_betty_pt_2.html From Insidesocal.com]</ref>

==Connections==
*[[Santos (Ugly Betty)|Santos]] - Justin's father; Ignacio, Justin's maternal grandfather, would rather see Santos stay away from the family because of his gambling problems and not having been there for Hilda and Justin throughout Justin's life. He was shot and killed after trying to save a clerk at a convenience store. His appearance in the season 2 premiere episode was a fantasy induced by Hilda's grief. In the end of the episode Hilda finally admits Santos is gone and begins to mourn his loss rather than live in denial.
*[[Marc St. James]] - Betty's co-worker at ''MODE''; Marc has taken a liking to Justin as he knows what he is going through. The two often discuss fashion and Marc usually gives Justin advice on how to deal with the kids who bully him at school ("Learn to run really fast").
*[[Christina McKinney]] - Betty's co-worker at ''MODE''; she thinks Justin is adorable.
*[[Daniel Meade]] - Betty's boss at ''MODE''; Justin is a fan.
*[[Wilhelmina Slater]] - Justin idolizes her glamour and style. Justin escorted her around [[Fashion Week]] while subbing for Marc, telling her who she was talking to, their outfit and what was wrong with it. Wilhelmina thanked him and mistakenly called him Jason to which Justin replied, "Actually, it's Justin but you can call me whatever you want, I love you!"
