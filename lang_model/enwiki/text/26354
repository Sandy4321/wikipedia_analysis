'''Walton''' is a village and [[civil parish]], on the [[Polden Hills]], {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|lk=on}} south west of [[Glastonbury]] in the [[Mendip]] district of [[Somerset]], England. The parish includes the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of '''Asney'''.

== History ==

Saxon pressure seems to have driven the Britons from the immediate area around 650 A.D. About 700 A.D. the former Celtic monastery at Glastonbury was revived under royal Saxon patronage. By about 740 A.D. the general lines of parish boundaries in this area seem to have been fixed. This early development may well have been due to the organising urges of the monastic authorities.<ref name="anon"/>

Walton was a manor of [[Glastonbury Abbey]] at the time of the [[Domesday Book]],<ref name="bush">{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|title=Somerset: The Complete Guide|publisher=Dovecote Press|date=1994|pages=212|isbn=1874336261}}</ref> which talks about 30 hides. A hide for tax purposes ([[Danegeld]]) was counted as about 150 acres worked under the 3 field system. Thus Walton could have been some 4500 acres, all owned and directly managed by the Abbey.<ref name="anon">Anonymous history kept in Walton church.</ref> With the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] and the scramble for monastic assets, Sir John Thynne of [[Longleat]] acquired Walton; lock, stock and barrel. The entire village was owned by the Bath estate until sold by auction in 1939.<ref name="anon"/><ref name="bush"/>

The population rose slowly from the 150 or so in 1087 to nearly 400 in 1801, and nearly 800 by 1845. Emigration, enclosures and agricultural depression severely drove down the numbers as the 19th century rolled on.<ref name="anon"/>

With the rise in importance of [[Street, Somerset | Street]] and the growth of a more varied, mobile society, the population started to rise again.<ref name="anon"/>

==Landmarks==

Walton windmill was probably built around 1793 and worked until 1900; it is now a private residence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=267810|title=Walton Windmill |work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref>

==Religious sites==

A Norman church was erected at about 1150 and rebuilt about 1350, when Street church was going up. Street was one of the 'seven churches' claimed by the Abbey under the Ina charter. Walton was in effect a chapelry of Street but the rectors of Street <U+2014> when resident <U+2014> lived at Walton in some style. The Old Parsonage is believed to be what remains of the monastic manor courthouse with an attached house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=267808|title=The Old Parsonage|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref>

The Church of The Holy Trinity was rebuilt in 1866 by John Norton with carved work by Seymour of Taunton. It is a Grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Church of The Holy Trinity | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=267807 | accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>
