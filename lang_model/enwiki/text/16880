'''Germaine Maurice Lindsay''', also known as '''Abdullah Shaheed Jamal''', ([[September 23]], [[1985]] &ndash; [[July 7]], [[2005]]) was one of the four [[suicide bombers|terrorists]] who detonated bombs on three trains on the [[London Underground]] and one bus in central London during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], killing 56 (including themselves) and injuring more than 700.

Lindsay, who changed his name to Abdullah Shaheed Jamal after his conversion to [[Islam]], detonated the bomb that killed 26 people, plus himself, on a train travelling on the Piccadilly line between the [[Kings Cross St. Pancras tube station|King's Cross St. Pancras]] and [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]] [[The Tube|Tube]] stations.

==Biography==
Lindsay was born in [[Jamaica]]. He moved to the UK when he was 5 months old and converted to Islam at age 15. A carpet-fitter, he had previously lived in [[Huddersfield]] in [[West Yorkshire]] before moving to [[Aylesbury]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. His wife, Samantha Lewthwaite, a native of Aylesbury who had converted to Islam, lived with him and gave birth to their second child two months after his death. Germaine also persuaded his mother, Mary McLeod, the daughter of an Evangelical Christian, to convert to Islam <ref name ="IHT">http://iht.com/articles/2005/07/18/news/bomber.php</ref>.

He engaged in "work experience" with a local council, which he is said to have enjoyed, although the pay was poor <ref>http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/1,,2005320810,00,00.html</ref>

Claims have been made that Lindsay was a violent drug dealer in Huddersfield prior to his conversion to Islam <ref>http://ichuddersfield.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0330features/tm_objectid=15866918%26method=full%26siteid=50060-name_page.html.</ref>

Friends say that after his conversion he rejected his old friends and old habits and completely embraced an extremist anti-Western understanding of Islam, reminiscent of al-Qaeda rhetoric.  His mother recalls their shock at the 9/11 attacks and wondered how Muslims could have done something like that. His wife, Lewthwaite, now 22 (who has since unofficially taken the [[Muslim]] name Sherafiyah) denied Lindsay's involvement until authorities produced forensic evidence to confirm his identity. <ref name="IHT" /> She later went on record stating she abhorred the attacks and that her husband's mind had been poisoned by radicals<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273804.stm</ref>.

A raid by [[Scotland Yard]] found no explosives at Lindsay's flat. Lindsay is believed to have hired one of the cars left at [[Luton]] railway station on [[7 July]] before the bombers made their rail journey to [[London]].

Abdul Dayan, the [[imam]] of the Jamia Ghausia [[mosque]] in [[Aylesbury]], said that Lindsay did not attend, and did not mix with the largely [[Pakistan]]i [[Muslim]] community. But other Muslims of Aylesbury did notice some extremist views that Lindsay had and thus challenged him regarding such views, such as his praising of 9/11.

== July 22 2005 ==
On [[July 22]] police and fire services were called to Lindsay's home after neighbours reported a strong smell of [[petrol]] coming from Lindsay's home, 10 Northern Road, [[Aylesbury]]. It was suspected to be an [[arson]] attack on the empty property.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4707277.stm</ref>.  Since then it has been revealed in the local press that his wife and son are living under [[police protection]] and will not be returning home. In [[December 2005]] two 17-year-olds were charged with attempted arson for the attack,the two teenagers are now in a Young Offender's Institute awaiting an Adult Prison.
