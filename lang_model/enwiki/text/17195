He served as [[List of leaders of Ukraine#First Secretaries of the Central Committee|First Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]], or leader of the [[Ukrainian SSR]], from 1957 to 1963 and as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] from 1965 to 1977. He was replaced as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977 by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. The same year he lost his seat in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (Politburo) and was forced to resign from active politics. 

Podgorny was born in the city of Karlovka in 1903 to a Ukrainian [[working class]] family. He graduated in from a local worker's school in 1926, and again, in 1931 from the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry. He became a member of the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] in 1930. him Podgorny climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder; by 1953 he had become Second Secretary of the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]]. After [[Anastas Mikoyan]]'s resignation Podgorny was voted into office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]]'s fall from favour Podgorny became the second-most powerful figure in the Soviet Union until his removal as head of state in 1977, according to historian [[Robert Vincent Daniels]].

==Early life==
Podgorny was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 February|1903|5 February}} in [[Karlivka|Karlovka]], [[Russian Empire]] to a Ukrainian working class family. Podgorny started working at the age of 17 as a student at the mechanical workshops in Karlovka. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] Podgorny became one of the founders of the local Karlovka [[Komsomol]]. He served as a  Secretary of the Komsomol from 1921 to 1923. Three years later in 1926 Podgorny graduated from a local workers' school, but later graduated again in 1931, this time from the [[Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry]]. In 1930, one year before his graduation, Podgorny became a member of the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]]. Following his 1931 graduation Podgorny started working in the sugar industry. He was promoted to Deputy Chief Engineer of [[Vinnytsia]] in 1937 and was again promoted in 1939 as the Chief Engineer of the Kamenetz-Podolsk Oblast sugar-trusts. He continued his climb up the system and by the end of 1939 Podgorny had become Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. The next year, in 1940, Podgorny was appointed to the position of Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="warheroes">{{cite web | author =  | title = <U+041F><U+043E><U+0434><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430><U+0439> <U+0412><U+0438><U+043A><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> | language = Russian | publisher = warheroes.ru | url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=9115 | accessdate = 18 November 2010 | date = }}</ref>

==Ukraine and national politics (1942<U+2013>1963)==
Podgorny became the Director of the [[Moscow Technological Institute of Food Industry]] in 1942, during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] (World War II). After liberating [[Ukraine]] from the hands of [[Nazi Germany]], Podgorny reestablished Soviet control over the newly liberated Ukrainian territories on the orders of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Ukrainian SSR) and the [[Soviet Government]]. In the post-war years Podgorny regained his old office of Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian SSR, but was later appointed in 1946 as a Permanent Representative to the [[Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR]]. In April 1950 he was made First Secretary of the Kharkiv Regional Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] (CPU). Three years later, in 1953, Podgorny was elevated to Second Secretary of the [[Central Committee]] (CC) of the CPU. From 1957-63 he was First Secretary of the CC of the CPU. In this role, Podgorny worked on reorganising and modernising the Ukrainian economy which had been destroyed during the war years. As First Secretary he tried to further increase the rate of industrial and agricultural production and to improve people's welfare. He paid particular attention to improving party organisation and educating new [[cadres]].<ref name="warheroes"/> 

In 1960 Podgorny became a [[List of members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1960s|member of the Politburo]] (Political Bureau) and by 1963 had risen to prominence within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). As a [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] of Khrushchev he travelled with him to the [[United Nations headquarters]] in 1960. He acted as a Soviet emissary to [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovkia]], [[East Germany]], [[Canada]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Having been a close companion of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Podgorny's belief were strongly influenced by him, and under [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule, Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within the Soviet leadership, even more liberal than Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]].{{sfn|Law|1975|p=223}}

Podgorny briefly fell out of Khruschev's favor in 1961 when he blamed bad corn yields in the Ukrainian SSR on "bad weather".  Khrushchev, on the other hand, claimed that the crops were "stolen" and "pilfered".<ref name="badweather"/> However, in 1962, Podgorny could report to Khrushchev that output in agriculture had again increased. The Ukrainian SSR, under Podgorny's leadership, had in fact doubled Ukraine's supply of grain to the state from the previous year. [[First World]] commentators, because of his handling of agriculture, saw Podgorny as one of Khrushchev's many potential heirs.<ref name="badweather">{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897942-2,00.html | title = The Leading Contenders to Succeed a Tired Khrushchev | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | language = | date= 29 June 1962 | accessdate = 24 January 2011 | page = 2 }}</ref>

==Head of state (1965<U+2013>1977)==
===Appointment and the collective leadership===
During the 1964 ouster to remove [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] and [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Premier]] both Podgorny and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] appealed to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], blaming Khrushchev for economic failures, and accusing him of [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]] and immodest behavior. Influenced by the Brezhnev allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taubman|first=William|year=2003|title=Khrushchev: The Man and His Era|publisher=W. W. Norton & Co.|isbn=039332484|page=5}}</ref> In the aftermath of Khrushchev's removal a short-lived collective leadership consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary; [[Alexei Kosygin]] as [[head of government]], and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] as [[head of state]] was formed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taubman|first=William|year=2003|title=Khrushchev: The Man and His Era|publisher=W. W. Norton & Co.|isbn=039332484|page=16}}</ref> In 1965 Podgorny replaced Mikoyan as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]; Podgorny took Mikoyan's place in the collective leadership.{{sfn|Law|1975|p=224}}

The majority of [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] members under Brezhnev were [[Hardline|conservative communists]].  Even so, Podgorny remained one of the most liberal-minded members in the [[Era of Stagnation]]. Other liberal-minded Politburo members included Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] and [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]].{{sfn|Law|1975|p=211}} Factionalism within the Soviet leadership in the 1960s, led Podgorny to become more active and he held several speeches in [[Moscow]] and went on numerous [[state visit]]s at the expense of Brezhnev and Kosygin's popularity. There were speculations circulating [[Soviet society]] that Podgorny was trying to replace Kosygin as Premier, or even Brezhnev as General Secretary, due to his increasing presence in the late-1960s. The [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th party congress]], while reaffirming Brezhnev's and Kosygin's respective positions, made it clear that Podgorny had become a major player in [[Soviet politics]].{{sfn|Law|1975|p=211}} The collective leadership was eventually left powerless in the late-1970s when Brezhnev had close to full-control over the Politburo.{{sfn|Law|1975|p=169}}

===Diplomatic protocol===
In 1967, Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to [[Egypt]]ian Vice President [[Anwar Sadat]] which claimed, falsely, that [[Israel]]i troops were massing along the [[Syria]]n border, just before the outbreak of the [[Six-Day War]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Leng, Russell J. | title = Bargaining and learning in recurring crises: the Soviet-American, Egyptian-Israeli, and Indo-Pakistani rivalries | publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]] | year = 2000 | date =  | pages = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5gyS1x44zAQC&dq | page = 152 | isbn = 0472067036 }}</ref> The same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope [[Paul VI]] as part of the pontiff's [[ostpolitik]], which resulted in greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.traditioninaction.org/RevolutionPhotos/A051rcPaulVI.htm|title=Paul VI invites Communist Podgorny to the Vatican |date=January 1967 |publisher=Traditioninaction.org | accessdate = 18 November 2010 }}</ref> In 1971 Podgorny went on two [[state visit]]s, the first to the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the second to [[North Vietnam]]; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]] to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations.{{sfn|Law|1975|p=429}} Two years later, in 1973, Podgorny visited [[Finland]] and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]'s [[Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Law|1975|p=212}}

Brezhnev conspired to oust Podgorny already in 1970. The reason was simple, Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet [[diplomatic protocol]]. Since September 1970 Brezhnev tried to form an opposition in the Politburo to oust Podgorny. According to ''Time'', "There was some speculation in Moscow" that if Brezhnev didn't succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State; modelled after several other institutions found in, for example, [[East Germany]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] and the [[Communist Romania|Socialist Republic of Romania]]. The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR. Even so, Brezhnev's backers were unable, and didn't even try, to remove Podgorny from the head of state at the 1970 Central Committee plenum when they had the chance. Brezhnev could count on only five votes, while another seven Politburo members were opposed to granting Brezhnev more power; removing Podgorny would in fact mean the end of the collective leadership.<ref name="Brezhnevprotocol">{{cite news| author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877509,00.html | title = Soviet Union: Whoa, Comrade Brezhnev | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | language = | date= 6 December 1971 | accessdate = 24 January 2011 | page = 1 }}</ref>

While Brezhnev was plotting, Podgorny's position within the Politburo grew stronger. Podgorny had been able to win over the support form the hardline communists due to Brezhnev's liberal-minded policy regarding Yugoslavia, military disarmament deals with the [[First World]] and forcing East Germany into a concession with [[West Germany]] in the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Berlin negotiations]].<ref name="Brezhnevprotocol"/>

===Removal===
Podgorny's removal from office in 1977 has become the most notable example of power transfer in the [[Era of Stagnation|late Brezhnev Era]].{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=35}} According to [[Robert Vincent Daniels]] Podgorny was before his removal the second-most powerful man in the Soviet Union, behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=36}} The post of Chairman of the Presidium had acquired more powers during his tenure, and had changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR. There were some [[Sovietologist]]s who foresaw Podgorny's fall. The decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise. An [[unanimous]] vote was taken by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] after [[Grigory Romanov]] proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=36}} The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise, and immediately after the vote, got up from his politburo seat to instead sit with the ordinary members. The Central Committee had however voted him off the Politburo, and Podgorny still retained his seat as Chairman. After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny's name disappeared from Soviet media.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=37}} The Soviet media told the Soviet people that Podgorny retired due to his stance against [[d<U+00E9>tente]] and [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|producing more consumer goods]].{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=38}} Podgorny lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=39}}

However, due to his old age, Brezhnev was regarded as too old to carry out some of the functions of the head of state. The Supreme Soviet, on the command of Brezhnev, established the new post of [[First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet|First Deputy Chairman]] of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, an office equivalent to the First World post of Vice President. [[Vasili Kuznetsov (politician)|Vasili Kuznetosv]], at the age of 76, was unanimously approved by the Supreme Soviet as First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium.<ref>{{cite news| author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915628,00.html | title = Soviet Union: Veep in Moscow | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | language = | date= 17 October 1977 | accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = }}</ref>

==Retirement, death  and legacy==
[[File:Nikolay Podgorniy Novod 10.jpg|right|thumb|Podgorny's grave stone at Novodevichy]]
After his [[resignation]], Podgorny's life is not well documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with [[President of Finland]], [[Urho Kekkonen]]. There was never any explanation given, nor a [[denunciation]] of him, by the Soviet authorities.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=37}} He officially became a [[pensioner]] following his resignation. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the [[Novodevichy cemetery]].<ref name="warheroes"/> 

As with many other high-standing Soviet officials Podgorny was honored with several awards. He was awarded five [[Orders of Lenin]], one [[Order of the Red Banner]] and several medals, as well as being awarded several foreign state prizes by the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], the [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia]] and [[Finland]].<ref name="warheroes"/>
