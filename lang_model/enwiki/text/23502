'''Endesa, S.A.''' ('''E'''mpresa '''N'''acional '''d'''e '''E'''lectricidad, '''S'''.'''A'''.) ({{nyse|ELE}}), ({{BMAD|ES0130670112|ELE}}) is the largest [[Electric power transmission|electric]] [[Public utility|utility]] company in [[Spain]]. It has 10 million customers in Spain, with domestic annual generation of over 97,600 [[GWh]] from [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[fossil fuel|fossil-fueled]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], and renewable resource [[power plant]]s.  Internationally, it serves another 10 million customers and provides over 80,100 GWh annually.  Total customers numbered 22.2 million as of December 31, 2004. It also markets [[energy]] in [[Europe]].  The company has additional interests in Spanish [[natural gas]] and [[telecommunication]]s companies. 

The company was formed in 1944 as ''Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, S.A.'' and changed its name to ''Endesa, S.A.'' in 1997. In September 2004, it took control of the French company [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> nationale d'<U+00E9>lectricit<U+00E9> et de thermique|SNET]] (''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> nationale d'<U+00E9>lectricit<U+00E9> et de thermique''). This was followed by the [[downsizing]] of 30% of SNET's employees [http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-28/2006-02-28-825123].

In 2006 and 2007 Endesa was the target of a takeover bid by [[Gas Natural]] and Germany's [[E.ON]] and Italian [[ENEL]]. Curiously, the foreign E.On is preferred as new owner by Endesa right-oriented bosses and some media. Gas Natural is a Catalonian company. It is seen now too close to left politics and separatist powers.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}The Gas Natural reference bank -La Caixa- contributed <U+20AC>&nbsp;6&nbsp;million to Partido Socialista de Catalu<U+00F1>a before the bid. When this was discovered, a media frenzy attacked the questionable interests in the affair. It has been noted too, that Gas Natural is very small compared to the other main actors in this story.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

In 2/2/2007 E.On offered <U+20AC>38.75  for each share of Endesa. However E.On withdrew their bid on 04/03/2007 in exchange for a promise from rival bidders to sell it part of the Spanish utility's assets. Acciona & Enel succeeded in their bid to acquire Endesa in October 2007 for an estimated <U+20AC>42.519 billion and they announced later that month that they jointly hold 92.06% of Endesa's share capital (25.01% Acciona and 67.05% Enel) as a result of their 100% takeover bid launched on Endesa, the remaining 7.94% is free float.
Acciona & Enel, via a 10 year shareholder agreement, will jointly manage Endesa through a holding company, controlled by Acciona, which will hold 50.01% of Endesa's share capital.
