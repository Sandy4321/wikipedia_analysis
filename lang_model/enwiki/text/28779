[[File:LghtRailShuafat1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shuafat Road]]
===Antiquity===
The place was known to the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]]s and [[Crusade]]rs as ''Dersophath'';.<ref name=Shahinp334>{{cite book|author=Mariam Shahin|title=Palestine: A Guide|year=2005|publisher=[[Interlink Books]]|isbn=1-56656-557-X|page=334}}</ref>{{Dubious|date=February 2012}}<ref name=Pringle>{{cite book|title=Secular Buildings in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: An Archaeological|author=Denys Pringle|page=94|year=1997|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-46010-7|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=-_NbE5obqRMC&pg=PA94&dq=dersophath}}</ref>  Biblical identifications include [[Gebim]], a village in north Jerusalem whose inhabitants fled the approaching [[Assyria]]n army, according to the [[Book of Isaiah]],<ref name=Eerdmans>{{cite book|title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible|page=487|year=2000|publisher=Wm.

Following a 1991 [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig in Shuafat by Alexander Onn and Tzvi Greenhut, a room dating to the 2nd century BC was identified as a prayer room or synagogue, making one of the oldest ever found. However the site was can no longer be identified and has been questioned.<ref>The Book of Acts in Its Palestinian Setting,

During an archaeological [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] conducted near the Shuafat refugee camp in preparation for the laying of the tracks for the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] system, the remains of an ancient Roman settlement, dating back to the Roman Empire were discovered. The settlement was described as a 'sophisticated community impeccably planned by the Roman authorities, with orderly rows of houses and two fine public bathhouses to the north.' The findings are said be the first indication of an active Jewish settlement in the area of Jerusalem after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|city fell in 70 A.D.]]. The main indication that the settlement was a Jewish one is the assemblage of stone vessels found there. Such vessels, for food storage and serving, were only used by Jews because they were believed not to transmit impurity. Archaeologists believe stone basins discovered at the site were used to hold ashes from the destroyed [[Jewish Temple|Temple]].<ref name=Kershner/><ref name=Haaretz>{{cite web|title=Shuafat dig reveals first sign of Jewish life after destruction of Second Temple|author=Amiram Barkat|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=664903|date=2 January 2006|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>
===Ottoman era===
Local legend holds that the modern settlement was established several hundred years ago by immigrants from the [[Hejaz]].<ref name="BHCC">[http://www.beithanina.org/en/bh/about_bh.html Beit Hanina Community Center]</ref><ref>[http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/site_form_atar_eng.asp?site_id=2289&pic_cat=4&icon_cat=6&york_cat=9&type_id=197]</ref>

In 1596, the village was inhabited by eight Muslim families who paid taxes on wheat, barley, vineyards and other agricultural produce.<ref>{{Citation|last1=H<U+00FC>tteroth|first1=Wolf-Dieter|first2=Kamal|last2=Abdulfattah|year=1977|title=Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century|publisher=Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5.

===British Mandate era===
The town of Shuafat was to be the most northernmost point of the [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|''corpus separatum'' proposed in 1947 for Jerusalem and its surrounding villages]], which "in view of its association with three world religions" was to be "accorded special and separate treatment from the rest of Palestine and should be placed under effective United Nations control".<ref name=Waart>{{cite book|title=Dynamics of Self-Determination in Palestine: Protection of Peoples As a|author=Paul Jacob Ignatius Maria de Waart|page=216|year=1994|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-08286-7|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=8bfkImTG1MgC&pg=PA216&dq=accorded+special+and+separate+treatment+from+the+rest+of+Palestine+and+should+be+placed+under+effective+United+Nations+control}}</ref>
===Jordanian era===
During the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War]] [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] attempted to lead the village's residents in an attack against the neighboring Jewish village of [[Neve Yaakov]]. The villagers refused anything less than a full conquest of Neve Yaakov lest their village suffer a reprisal from the Jews. In April, the Jewish [[Palmach]] captured the village in the course of [[Operation Yevusi]] and expelled the inhabitants. The Palmach began demolishing buildings, but ultimately withdrew following a battle at the [[Tomb of Samuel]]. On 13 May, the villagers were again expelled, this time by order of the Transjordanian [[Arab Legion]], which was preparing for an invasion through the area.<ref>{{cite book

After the war, Shuafat was occupied by [[Jordan]], which subsequently, in April 1950, unilaterally declared it had [[Jordanian occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem|annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem]]. Construction of the Shuafat refugee camp began in 1964 by the UN, to alleviate the crowded conditions in the [[Askar (camp)|Askar camp]].<ref>Meron Benvenisti, ''Jerusalem: The Torn City,'' Isratypeset, 1976, p.69</ref> Construction was completed in 1966. On the orders of King Hussein, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] transferred 500 Arab squatters from hovels in the burnt out [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter of the Old City]] of Jerusalem, to the camp.<ref>[http://www.eastsidestory.ps/pdf-files/18BeyondTheWalEng18.doc Beyond the Wall, Ir Amim Report, January 2007]</ref><ref>Doson, Nandita and Sabbah, Abdul Wahad (editors) ''Stories from our Mothers'' (2010), pp.18-19 </ref> According to David Bedein,  Jordan intended to renovate the Jewish Quarter, but the plan became obsolete in the wake of the [[Six Day War]] in 1967.<ref>http://israelbehindthenews.com/Oct-13-98.htm</ref>
===State of Israel===
After the Six-Day War, the town and refugee camp were annexed by Israel and became part of the Jerusalem municipal district.<ref name=Kershner/> The residents were offered Israeli citizenship, but most refused it. Many accepted permanent residency status instead.<ref name=Kershner/>

According to Isabel Kershner of the [[New York Times]], Shuafat suffers from an absence of municipal planning, overcrowding, and potholed roads.<ref name=Kershner/>

The Shuafat refugee camp is the only [[Palestinian refugee camp]] located inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli-administered area. While its residents carry Jerusalem identity cards, which grants them the same privileges and rights as regular Israelis, the camp itself is largely serviced by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]], even though 40 - 50% of the camp's population are not registered refugees. The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] was partially constructed between the camp and the rest of Shuafat and Jerusalem. Some health services are provided by Israeli clinics in the camp. The Israeli presence is limited to checkpoints controlling entry and exit. According to [[Ir Amim]], the camp suffers from high crime because [[Israel Police|Israeli Police]] rarely enter due to security concerns, while the [[Palestinian Civil Police Force]] does not operate in  Israeli-administered municipalities. Unlike other UN-run refugee camps, residents of Shuafat camp pay taxes to the Israeli authorities.<ref name=jpost1>{{cite web|title=New checkpoint opened at entrance to Shuafat|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=249148|month=December | year=2011|accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref><ref name=IrAmin>{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Neighborhood Profile: Shuafat Refugee Camp|publisher=[[Ir Amim]]|url=http://www.ir-amim.org.il/Eng/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/ShuafatRefugeeCampEng(1).doc|month=August | year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-01|format=DOC}}</ref>

In a survey conducted as part of the research for the book ''Negotiating Jerusalem'' (2000), it was reported that 59% of Israeli Jews supported redefining the borders of the city of Jerusalem so as to exclude Arab settlements such as Shuafat, in order to ensure a "Jewish majority" in Jerusalem.<ref name=Segal>{{cite book|title=Negotiating Jerusalem|author=Jerome M.

In July 2001, the Israeli authorities destroyed 14 homes under construction in Shuafat on the orders of then mayor [[Ehud Olmert]], who said the structures were built without permits. No one was yet living in them.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/violence-flares-in-jerusalem-as-israeli-bulldozers-destroy-dozen-illegal-homes-677285.html Violence flares in Jerusalem as Israeli bulldozers destroy dozen 'illegal' homes]</ref> The families acknowledged they do not own the land they built on, but believed they had permission to build there from Islamic Trust religious authorities.

====Urban development====
In 2012, Sorbonne scholar Prof. Sylvaine Bulle cited the Shuafat refugee camp  for its urban renewal dynamic, seeing it as an example of a creative adaptation to the fragmented space of the camps towards creating a [[bricolage]] city, with businesses relocating from east Jerusalem there and new investment in commercial projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/their-shoafat-outshines-her-paris-1.255938 |title=Their Shoafat outshines her Paris |author=Esther Zandberg |date=2008-10-23 |publisher=HAARETZ |accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>

The neighbourhood<U+2019>s [[Main Street]], Shuafat Road, was previously part of [[Highway 60 (Israel)|route 60]]. In the 1990s a new route was built to the east of the neighbourhood, a dual carriageway with 3 lines in each direction, relieving [[traffic congestion]] along the road.
