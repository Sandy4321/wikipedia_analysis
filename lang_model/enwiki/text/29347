==History==
The European Nucleotide Archive originated from separate databases, the earliest of which was the EMBL Data Library, established in October 1980 at the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), [[Heidelberg]].<ref name="Hamm86" /> The first release of this [[database]] was made in April 1982 and contained a total of 568 separate entries consisting of around 500,000 [[base pair]]s.<ref name="KK84">{{Cite pmid|6530028|noedit}}</ref> In 1984, referring to the EMBL Data Library, Kneale and Kennard remarked that "it was clear some years ago that a large computerized database of sequences would be essential for research in Molecular Biology".<ref name="KK84" />
[[File:NucleotideSequences 86 87.jpeg|thumbnail|Nucleotide sequence data in book form]]
Despite the primary distribution method at the time being via [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]], by 1987, the EMBL Data Library was being used by an estimated 10,000 scientists internationally.<ref name="Cam87">{{Cite pmid| 3353226 |noedit}}</ref> The same year, the EMBL File Server was introduced to serve database records over [[BITNET]], [[TERENA|EARN]] and the early [[Internet]].<ref>{{cite pmid|2388823|no edit}}</ref> In May of 1988 the journal ''[[Nucleic Acids Research]]'' introduced a policy stating that "manuscripts submitted to [Nucleic Acids Research] and containing or discussing sequence data must be accompanied by evidence that the data have been deposited with the EMBL Data Library."<ref>{{Cite pmid| 16617480|noedit}}</ref>

Following the uptake of [[Sanger sequencing]], the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] (then known as The Sanger Centre) had begun cataloguing sequence reads along with quality information in a database called The Trace Archive.<ref name="pmid20972220">{{cite journal|author=Leinonen R, Akhtar R, Birney E, ''et al.'' |title=The European Nucleotide Archive|journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=39|issue=Database issue |pages=D28<U+2013>31 |year=2011 |month=January|pmid=20972220 |pmc=3013801|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq967 |url=}}</ref> The Trace Archive grew substantially with the commercialisation of high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as [[Roche Applied Science|Roche]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]].<ref name="LeinonenAkhtar2009">{{cite journal|last1=Leinonen|first1=R.|last2=Akhtar|first2=R.|last3=Birney|first3=E.|last4=Bonfield|first4=J.|last5=Bower|first5=L.|last6=Corbett|first6=M.|last7=Cheng|first7=Y.|last8=Demiralp|first8=F.|last9=Faruque|first9=N.|title=Improvements to services at the European Nucleotide Archive|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=38|issue=Database|year=2009|pages=D39<U+2013>D45|issn=0305-1048|doi=10.1093/nar/gkp998|display-authors=9}}</ref>
In 2008, the EBI combined the Trace Archive, EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (now also known as EMBL-Bank)<ref name='nsd'/> and a newly developed Sequence (or Short) Read Archive (SRA) to make up the ENA, aimed at providing a comprehensive [[nucleotide]] sequence archive.<ref name="pmid20972220" /> As a member of the [[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration]], the ENA exchanges data submissions each day with both the [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] and [[GenBank]].<ref name='about'> {{cite web | url = http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/about | title = About the European Nucleotide Archive | accessdate = 2013-01-07 | author = EMBL-EBI}}</ref>

The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-Bank) is the section of the ENA which contains high-level [[Genome_project#Genome_assembly|genome assembly]] details, as well as assembled sequences and their functional [[Genome project#Genome annotation|annotation]].<ref name="Stoesser2003" /><ref name="AmidBirney2011">{{cite journal|last1=Amid|first1=C.|last2=Birney|first2=E.|last3=Bower|first3=L.|last4=Cerdeno-Tarraga|first4=A.|last5=Cheng|first5=Y.|last6=Cleland|first6=I.|last7=Faruque|first7=N.|last8=Gibson|first8=R.|last9=Goodgame|first9=N.|title=Major submissions tool developments at the European nucleotide archive|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=40|issue=D1|year=2011|pages=D43<U+2013>D47|issn=0305-1048|doi=10.1093/nar/gkr946|display-authors=9}}</ref> EMBL-Bank is contributed to by direct submission from genome [[consortium|consortia]] and smaller research groups as well as by the retrieval of sequence data associated with [[patent application]]s.<ref name="nsd" /><ref name="Stoesser2002">{{cite journal|last1=Stoesser|first1=G.|title=The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=1|year=2002|pages=21<U+2013>26|issn=13624962|doi=10.1093/nar/30.1.21|pmid=11752244|last2=Baker|first2=W|last3=Van Den Broek|first3=A|last4=Camon|first4=E|last5=Garcia-Pastor|first5=M|last6=Kanz|first6=C|last7=Kulikova|first7=T|last8=Leinonen|first8=R|last9=Lin|first9=Q|pmc=99098|display-authors=9}}</ref>

As of release 114 (December 2012), the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database contains approximately 5<U+00D7>10<sup>11</sup> nucleotides with an uncompressed filesize of 1.6 [[terabyte]]s.<ref name='rel114'> {{cite web | title = EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database: Release Notes | date = Dec 2012 | publisher = EMBL-EBI | url = http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/Documentation/Release_notes/current/relnotes.html | work = EMBL-Bank Release Notes 114 | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}</ref>

===Data classes===
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database supports a variety of data derived from different sources including, but not limited to:<ref name='data'> {{cite web | url = http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/embl_bank_format | title = EMBL-Bank data classes | accessdate = 2013-01-08 | date = 2012 | publisher = EBML-EBI}}</ref>
*[[Expressed sequence tag]]s with their associated sample data.
*Nucleotide sequence being generated from [[whole genome sequencing]] projects at varying stages of assembly, including complete [[contig]]s and annotated, fully assembled sequence.
*Data relating to [[transcriptome|transcriptomics]], such as [[complementary DNA]], with optional annotation.
*Novel or extended annotations of existing [[coding region|coding sequences]], for example new sequence versions with corrected [[start codon|start]] or [[stop codon]]s.

===EMBL-Bank format===
The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a [[flat file database|flat file]] plaintext [[file format|format]] to represent and store data which is typically referred to as EMBL-Bank format.<ref name='uman'> {{cite web | url = ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/release/usrman.txt | title = EMBL-Bank User Manual (Release 114) | accessdate = 2013-01-08 | date = Dec 2012 | format = Plaintext | publisher = EMBL-EBI}}</ref> EMBL-Bank format uses a different [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as [[taxonomy|taxonomies]] as defined by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as <code>AC</code> to label the [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number]] and <code>KW</code> for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with <code>//</code>.<ref name='uman' />

==Data access==
[[File:ENA browser screenshot.png|thumb|400px|Screenshot of the ENA browser [[web application|web interface]], showing an HTML record.]]
The data contained in the ENA can be accessed manually or programmatically via [[Representational State Transfer|REST URL]] through the ENA browser. Initially limited to the Sequence Read Archive,<ref name="LeinonenAkhtar2009" />  the ENA browser now also provides access to the Trace Archive and EMBL-Bank, allowing file retrieval in a range of formats including [[XML]], [[HTML]], [[FASTA format|FASTA]] and FASTQ.<ref name="pmid20972220" /> Individual records can be accessed using their accession numbers and other text queries are enabled through the [[EB-eye]] search engine.<ref name="pmid20972220" /> Additionally, [[Sequence alignment|sequence similarity]]-based searches implemented using [[De Bruijn graph]]s offer another method of retrieving records from the ENA.<ref name="LeinonenAkhtar2009" />

The ENA is accessible via the EBI [[SOAP]] and REST APIs, which also offer access to other databases hosted at the EBI, such as [[Ensembl]] and [[InterPro]].<ref name="McwilliamValentin2009">{{cite journal|last1=Mcwilliam|first1=H.|last2=Valentin|first2=F.|last3=Goujon|first3=M.|last4=Li|first4=W.|last5=Narayanasamy|first5=M.|last6=Martin|first6=J.|last7=Miyar|first7=T.|last8=Lopez|first8=R.|title=Web services at the European Bioinformatics Institute-2009|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=37|issue=Web Server|year=2009|pages=W6<U+2013>W10|issn=0305-1048|doi=10.1093/nar/gkp302|pmid=19435877|pmc=2703973}}</ref>
