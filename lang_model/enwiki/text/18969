'''Hrant Dink''' ({{lang-hy|<U+0540><U+0580><U+0561><U+0576><U+0564> <U+054F><U+056B><U+0576><U+0584>}}, {{IPA2|h<U+0259><U+0279><U+0251>nt di<U+02D0>nk}}) ([[September 15]], [[1954]] <U+2013> [[January 19]], [[2007]]) was a [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish-Armenian]] [[editing|editor]], [[journalist]] and [[columnist]].

As [[editing#Executive editor|editor-in-chief]] of the bilingual Turkish-Armenian newspaper ''[[Agos]]'' (<U+0531><U+056F><U+0585><U+057D>), Dink was a prominent member of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] minority in [[Turkey]]. Dink was best known for his opinions on methods towards a Turkish-Armenian reconciliation and on human and minority rights in Turkey with a special emphasis on the rights of the Armenian minority and was often critical of both Turkey's [[denial of the Armenian Genocide|denial]] of the [[Armenian Genocide]], and of the [[Armenian diaspora]]'s campaign for its international recognition.<ref name="HRW070120"/><ref name="AIUK070119"/> Regarding his statements, Dink was prosecuted three times for [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|denigrating Turkishness]] and received numerous death threats from Turkish nationalists who accused him of [[treason|treachery]].<ref name="HRW070120"/><ref name="CPJ06SP"/><ref name="IPI070122"/><ref name="CPJ070119quote"/>

Hrant Dink was [[assassination|assassinated]] in [[Istanbul]] on [[January 19]], [[2007]], allegedly by [[Og<U+00FC>n Samast]], an ultra-nationalist Turk.  While Samast has since been taken into custody, pictures of Dink's alleged killer holding up a Turkish flag, flanked by smiling Turkish police and [[Turkish Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]] officers, have since surfaced, triggering a wave of  investigations and the removal from office of those involved.<ref name="radikal070202"/>

In his funeral, one hundred thousand mourners walked against the ideas that killed him, chanting "we are all Armenians" and "we are all Hrant Dink". The criticisms against [[Article 301]] grew even larger after his death, leading to the proposals of change in the parliament.

== Early life ==
Hrant Dink was born in [[Malatya]] on [[September 15]] [[1954]], the eldest of three sons to Sarkis Dink (known as Ha<U+015F>im Kalfa), a tailor from [[G<U+00FC>r<U+00FC>n]], [[Sivas Province|Sivas]], and G<U+00FC>lvart Dink, from [[Kangal]], Sivas.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/> His father's gambling debts led to the family's move to [[<U+0130>stanbul]] in 1960, where they sought a new beginning.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/> Sarkis Dink's gambling continued in <U+0130>stanbul, however, and one year after their move, Dink's parents separated in a bitter fight, which left Dink, then aged seven, and his brothers without a place to live, necessitating his grandfather to enroll the boys at the Gedikpa<U+015F>a Armenian Orphanage.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/> In his interviews, Dink pointed out his grandfather, a man who spoke seven languages and read constantly, was the role model and father figure that inspired Dink's love of letters.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/>

The Gedikpa<U+015F>a Armenian Orphanage, an institution run by the [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelical Community]] was to be home to Hrant Dink for the next ten years.<ref name="DinkLife"/> The Orphanage children spent their summers at the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp, on the Marmara beachfront in a suburb of <U+0130>stanbul, building and improving the summer camp during their stay.<ref name="tuzlacamp"/> The Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp played a significant role in Hrant Dink's life, both personally, as he met his future wife as a child and later married her at the Camp, and professionally, as the government-led closing of the Camp in 1984 was one of the factors that raised Dink's awareness of the issues of the Armenian community and eventually led to his becoming an activist.<ref name="DinkLife"/><ref name="tuzlacamp"/>

Dink received his primary education at the Hay Avedaranagan <U+0130>ncirdibi Protestant Armenian Primary School and Bezciyan School and his secondary education at the <U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar Surp Ha<U+00E7> Armenian High School, working as a tutor at the same time.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/> During his senior year, he was expelled from the <U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar Surp Ha<U+00E7>, and completed his high school degree at the <U+015E>i<U+015F>li Public High School.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/> Hrant Dink continued his education at [[Istanbul University]], where he studied zoology and became a sympathizer of T<U+0130>KKO, the armed faction of the [[Maoist]] [[Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist-Leninist|TKP-ML]].<ref name="DinkLife"/><ref name="vatan050210"/> Around this time, in 1972, he legally changed his name (to F<U+0131>rat Dink), along with two Armenian friends, Armanek and <U+0130>stepan also in the same faction, to disassociate their activities from the Armenian community.<ref name="vatan050210"/> Armanek Bak<U+0131>rc<U+0131>yan, who changed his name to Orhan Bak<U+0131>r at the same time as Dink, later rose in T<U+0130>KKO to membership of the central committee, took part in armed struggle in Eastern Turkey and was killed during fighting in 1978.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/> Having fallen in love, Hrant Dink parted ways with his friends and remained at the sympathiser level, completing his bachelor's degree in Zoology and enrolling in the Philosophy Department for a second bachelor's degree, which he did not complete.<ref name="DinkLife"/><ref name="vatan050210"/>

===Rakel Ya<U+011F>basan, childhood friend, future wife===

[[Image:Hrant_dink_rakel_dink_youth.jpg|130px|thumb|left|Hrant and Rakel Dink]]Hrant Dink met his future wife, Rakel Ya<U+011F>basan, when she came to the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp at age 9 in 1968.<ref name="cudilirakel"/> Born in 1959 in [[Silopi]], [[Cizre]], Rakel was one of 13 children of Siyament Ya<U+011F>basan, head of the Varto clan and Delal Ya<U+011F>basan who died when Rakel was a child.<ref name="cudilirakel"/> 

In 1915, the Varto clan had received orders to relocate along with the rest of the Armenian population in the region, but they were attacked during the journey.<ref name="cudilirakel"/> Five families from the clan escaped to nearby [[Mount Cudi|Cudi]] mountain and settled there, remaining without any contact to the outside world for 25 years.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/> Eventually they re-established contact and largely assimilated into the nearby Kurdish population, speaking Kurdish exclusively, although they retained knowledge of their Armenian origin and Christian belief.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/> Armenian Protestant lay preacher Hrant G<U+00FC>zelyan (also known as K<U+00FC><U+00E7><U+00FC>kg<U+00FC>zelyan), who was running a program for relocating Anatolian Armenian population to <U+0130>stanbul, visited the clan and brought back around 20 children to the Tuzla Camp, including Rakel and two of her brothers.<ref name="hoffman2002">{{cite paper | author=Hoffman, Tessa | title=Armenians in Turkey today | date=October, 2002 | year=2002 | publisher=The EU Office of Armenian Associations in Europe | format=PDF | url=http://www.armenian.ch/asa/Docs/faae02.pdf | accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref><ref name="stargazete070129"/>

Staying at the Tuzla Camp during summers and at the Gedikpa<U+015F>a Orphanage during winters, Rakel learned Turkish and Armenian, and finished primary school.<ref name="cudilirakel"/> But, because Rakel was registered as a Turk, not as an Armenian, she was not allowed to enroll at Armenian community schools and her father did not give permission for her to attend a Turkish school past the [[Education in Turkey|then-compulsory]] 5th grade.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/> Not able to obtain further formal schooling, Rakel was privately tutored by instructors at the Gedikpa<U+015F>a Orphanage.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/>

Rakel's father, Siyament Ya<U+011F>basan first opposed Hrant Dink's marriage proposal since the Varto clan traditionally practiced endogamy, but eventually relented when elders of the Armenian community, including [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Constantinople|Patriarch Kalustyan]] applied pressure and Rakel declared that she would marry no one else.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/> After potentially agreeing to the marriage, Siyament Ya<U+011F>basan asked for ''ba<U+015F>l<U+0131>k'', a form of [[dower]] paid to the bride's family by the bridegroom's family, for the sum of [[Turkish lira|TRL]]&nbsp;40,000, enough to purchase 6 flats in <U+0130>stanbul at the time, reducing his demand to [[Turkish lira|TRL]]&nbsp;5,000 through the intercession of Patriarch Kalustyan.<ref name="hurarsiv070203"/><ref name="cudilirakel"/> Hrant Dink and Rakel Ya<U+011F>basan got married in a civil ceremony at the Tuzla Camp on [[April 19]] [[1976]] when they were 22 and 17, respectively.<ref name="tuzlacamp"/><ref name="agos070126"/> One year later, at Rakel Dink's insistence, the couple conducted a church wedding ceremony on [[April 23]] [[1977]].<ref name="agos070126"/> Hrant and Rakel Dink had three children Delal, Arat and Sera.<ref name="radikal070124"/>

===Religious beliefs===
Hrant Dink was baptized and married within the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], but was educated and sheltered at [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Protestant]] institutions and received his introduction to religion within the Protestant sphere.<ref name="zaman051017"/> Dink was a member of the Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedikpa<U+015F>a, Istanbul as well as a member by birth in the Armenian Apostolic Church.<ref name="zaman051017"/><ref name='The Armenian Weekly 2007-01-27'/> He regarded both churches as part of his culture and said that he was not someone who dealt heavily with religious rituals.<ref name="zaman051017"/> Keeping the duality to the end, his funeral service was held in the Apostolic Church, by [[Patriarch Mesrob II Mutafyan of Constantinople|Patriarch Mutafyan]], with Protestant ministers delivering eulogies at the burial.<ref name="lraper070123"/>

===After college===
Having graduated from the university, Hrant Dink completed his [[Conscription in Turkey|military service]] in [[Denizli]], during which, his failure to be made sergeant despite receiving full marks on the examination led him to cry for several hours.<ref name="DinkLife"/> Whether the reason for his not being promoted was a result of his connections to T<U+0130>KKO or because he was Armenian, the discrimination he felt was one of the turning points on his way to activism.<ref name="Bolsohays9340"/><ref name="radikal070120"/> Returning back to <U+0130>stanbul, Dink established ''Beyaz Adam'', a bookstore in the [[Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y]] district with his brothers Hosrop and Yervant in 1979.<ref name="radikal070120"/><ref name="beyazadam">{{cite web | title=Hakk<U+0131>m<U+0131>zda | publisher=Beyaz Adam | accessdate=2007-04-03 | url=http://www.beyazadam.com/about.php}}{{tr icon}}</ref><ref name="istanbulsocietecivile"/> Encouraging students to browse and borrow needed books, the store gained recognition by word of mouth and gradually expanded into a multi-store bookstore and publishing house that specialized in textbooks, children's books, atlases and dictionaries.<ref name="beyazadam"/><ref name="istanbulsocietecivile"/> After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'<U+00E9>tat|1980 coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], at a period when it was difficult for Turkish citizens to obtain passports for travel abroad, Dink's brother Hosrop started traveling to Beirut and then to Europe by using falsified identification papers, and when he was caught in the act, Hrant Dink was also taken into custody as an associate.<ref name="DinkLife"/> Soon afterwards, Dink was questioned twice again by the police, once when one of the former residents of the Tuzla Camp was being investigated for possible connections to [[ASALA]], a guerrilla organization assassinating Turkish diplomats abroad and a second time when Hrant G<U+00FC>zelyan, who ran the Tuzla Camp, was arrested and charged with anti-Turkish propaganda, and had ASALA demand his release when they occupied the Turkish Consulate General in Paris and took hostages.<ref name="DinkLife"/>

=== Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp ===
[[Image:Armenian_childrens_camp_of_tuzla.jpg|thumb|right|A book on the Tuzla Camp was published in 2000 by the Human Rights Assoc. of Turkey, with an afterword by Hrant Dink]]Hrant Dink, together with his wife Rakel, took over the management of the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp at the time of G<U+00FC>zelyan's arrest, while continuing in the bookstore business with his brothers.<ref name="DinkLife"/><ref name="stargazete070129"/> In 1979, the General Directorate of Foundations started a court action to annul Gedikpa<U+015F>a Armenian Protestant Church's ownership of the camp, based on a 1974 ruling by the Court of Appeals that made it impossible for minority foundations to own real estate beyond what they possessed in 1936.<ref name="tuzlacamp"/> After a five year legal battle, the court ruled that the land should be returned to its previous owner and in 1984 the camp was closed down.<ref name="tuzlacamp"/> The closure of the camp, where over 22 years around 1,500 children stayed affected Dink deeply and over the years he wrote about the camp often:<ref name="tuzlacamp"/> {{quote|"I went to Tuzla when I was 8. I poured my labour in there for 20 years. I met my wife Rakel there. We grew up together. We were married in the camp. Our children were born there... After the September 12 coup, our camp manager was arrested on the claim that he was raising Armenian militants. A wrongful claim. None of us was brought up to be a militant. My friends and I, each of us old charges of the camp, rushed to fill the job to save the camp and the orphanage from shutting down. But then, one day they handed us a paper from a court... 'We just found out that your minority institutions don't have a right to buy real estate. We never should have given you that permission way back then. This place will now revert to its old owner.' We fought for five years and we lost... Little chance we had with the state as the contester. Hear my plea, brothers, sisters!.."<ref name="tuzlaihd"/>}}

The Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp was the subject of an exhibit by the Turkish Human Rights Organization in 1996, the materials from which was published in book form in 2000, with a foreword by [[Orhan Pamuk]] and an afterword by Hrant Dink.<ref name="tuzlaihd"/> In 2001 the camp grounds were sold to a local businessman who intended to build a house on the site until Dink contacted him and let him know that the land had belonged to an orphanage.<ref name="stargazete070129"/> The businessman offered to donate the land back, but the law at the time did not permit it.<ref name="stargazete070129"/> At the time of Dink's death in 2007, the camp grounds continued to stand empty, awaiting the new Foundation law that was passed at the end of 2006 but was vetoed and returned to parliament by President Sezer.<ref name="stargazete070129"/>

== Editor of ''Agos'' ==
Following the transfer of the ''Tuzla Armenian Youth Camp'' administration after 21 years of operation to direct Ministry of Education control, he decided to become the voice of his community by founding and assuming the role of editor-in-chief of ''[[Agos]]'' weekly in [[Istanbul]], a newspaper published in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. He tried to make it the democratic, opposition voice of Turkey, a voice used to inform the public of the injustices committed against the Armenian community.  One of the major aims of the newspaper was to contribute to a dialog between the Turkish and Armenian communities, as well as between Turkey and Armenia. Additionally, he wrote for the national dailies ''[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]'' and ''[[BirG<U+00FC>n]]''.

At its inception, ''Agos'' had only 1,800 subscriptions. With his balanced editorials, the subscription increased to 6,000 in a very short time and included many Turkish subscribers. It became a medium of communication for reaching the Armenian community and for the Armenian community to make its voice heard.<ref name="DinkLife"/>

According to Hrant Dink, ''Agos'' helped the development of the Armenian community such that it helped triple the participation in the last Patriarchal elections, trained many journalists, became the community's face to Turkish society and cultivated many friends.  He voiced his intention for an "Institute of Armenian Studies" in Istanbul.<ref name="policy3" /> 

===Editorial policy===
Dink hoped his questioning would pave the way for peace between the two peoples:

{{quote|"If I write about the [Armenian] genocide it angers the Turkish generals. I want to write and ask how we can change this historical conflict into peace. They don<U+2019>t know how to solve the [[Armenian Question|Armenian problem]]."<ref name="CPJ06SP" />}}

He defended his constant challenge of established notions:

{{quote |"I challenge the accepted version of history because I do not write about things in black and white. People here are used to black and white; that<U+2019>s why they are astonished that there are other shades, too."<ref name="CPJ06SP" />}}

===Armenian issues===
Dink was one of Turkey's most prominent Armenian voices and, despite threats on his life, he refused to remain silent. He always said his aim was to improve the difficult relationship between Turks and Armenians.<ref name="bbcfury"/> Active in various democratic platforms and civil society organizations, Hrant Dink emphasized the need for democratization in Turkey and focused on the issues of free speech, minority rights, civic rights and issues pertaining to the Armenian community in Turkey. He was a very important peace activist. In his public speeches, which were often intensely emotional, he never refrained from using the word genocide when talking about the Armenian Genocide, a term fiercely rejected by Turkey.<ref name="TurkishPress"/>

At the same time, he made clear that this term had a political meaning, rather than a historical one, and he was strongly critical of the strategy of the Armenian diaspora of pressuring Western governments into official recognition of the Genocide label.<ref name="policy3"/><ref name="iht070119"/>

[[Image:Hrant Dink in Screamers.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Hrant Dink featured in the [[genocide]] documentary film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]]'' in 2006]]
Dink featured prominently in the 2006 [[genocide]] documentary film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]]'' in which he explains:
{{quote|There are Turks who don't admit that their ancestors committed genocide. If you look at it though, they seem to be nice people<U+2026>  So why don't they admit it?  Because they think that genocide is a bad thing which they would never want to commit, and because they can't believe their ancestors would do such a thing either.<ref name="policy2"/> }}

Hrant Dink believed that [[Armenian diaspora|diaspora Armenians]] should be able to live free of the weight of historical memory (the "residues of the past"), considering first and foremost the needs of the living majority (he said "eyes of the other side").<ref name="policy3"/>

Indicating that a show of empathy would have nothing to do with accepting or refusing the genocide, Dink called for dialogue:

{{quote |Turkish-Armenian relations should be taken out of a 1915 meters-deep well.<ref name="policy3"/> }}

By pointing out issues of rhetorical discourse that hampered [[Armenian-Turkish relations|Armenian-Turkish]] dialogue, he believed these obstacles could be overcome to the benefit of [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish Armenians]]. Dink's unique perspective has been described as a "four way mirror", simultaneously empathetic to people of the Armenian diaspora, citizens of the [[Republic of Armenia]], [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish Armenians]], and [[Turkish people|citizens of Turkey]].<ref name="policy3" /><br /> 

He was opposed to the French law that makes denial of Armenian Genocide a crime. He was planning to go to France to commit this 'crime', when  the law came into effect.<ref name="Milliyet"/><br />

===Policy view===

Hrant Dink promoted a policy of wider integration of Turkish-Armenians into the wider Turkish society. Critical of state injustices, he often underlined the fact that a stronger Turkey would be achieved through the elimination of discrimination. Even after his conviction for speaking of the Armenian Genocide, Dink continued to value his community, city, and country, noting often that his analysis and criticism was in the interest of strengthening the country. He concentrated on the mismanagement of community institutions, tried to promote obtaining rights through legal means, and was always open to compromise, once noting, "After all, Turkey is very reluctant to concede rights to its majority as well."<ref name="policy3" />

==Prosecution for denigrating Turkishness==

Dink was prosecuted three times for denigrating Turkishness under the [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code]].<ref name="HRW070120"/><ref name="CPJ06SP"/><ref name="IPI070122" /> He was acquitted the first time, convicted and received a postponed 6 months jail sentence the second time, which he had appealed at the European Court of Human Rights and at the time of his death, the prosecutor's office was getting ready to press charges for a third alleged offense. 

The first charge under the previous version of Article 301, then called Article 159, stemmed from a speech he delivered at a panel hosted by human rights NGO Mazlum-Der in <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa on 14 February 2002.<ref name="haber7"/> Speaking at the "Global Security, Terror and Human Rights, Multiculturalism, Minorities and Human Rights" panel, Dink and another speaker, lawyer <U+015E>ehmus <U+00DC>lek were pressed charges for publicly denigrating Turkishness and the Republic.<ref name="sanliurfa">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-01-27 }}{{tr icon}}</ref> In the speech, Dink had stated: {{quote|"Since my childhood, I have been singing the national anthem along with you. Recently, there is a section where I cannot sing any longer and remain silent. You sing it, I join you later. It is: ''Smile at my heroic race...''. Where is the heroism of this race? We are trying to form the concept of citizenship on national unity and a heroic race. For example, if it were ''Smile at my hard-working people...'', I would sing it louder than all of you, but it is not. Of the oath ''I am Turkish, honest and hard-working'', I like the 'honest and hard-working' part and I shout it loudly. The ''I am Turkish'' part, I try to understand as ''I am from Turkey''."<ref name="hurriyeturfa"/>}} On February 9, 2006, Hrant Dink, and <U+015E>ehmus <U+00DC>lek, who stood trial for another speech at the same panel, were acquitted of all charges.<ref name="hurriyet9feb"/>

The second charge under 301 was pressed for Dink's article called "Getting to know Armenia" ([[13 February]] [[2004]]), in which he suggested to diaspora Armenians that it was time to rid themselves of their rage against Turks, a condition he considered himself free of, keeping himself emotionally healthy while at the same time knowing something of discrimination. His statement, "replace the poisoned blood associated with the Turk, with fresh blood associated with Armenia"<ref name="ODN060207"/> resulted in a six-month suspended sentence.<ref name="vatan050210"/>

Dink defended himself vigorously against the charges and stated: {{quote|"This trial is based on a total misunderstanding," Dink told [[Reporters Without Borders]]. "I never meant to insult Turkish citizens. The term in question was taken out of context and is only symbolic. The real subject of the article is the Armenian diaspora who, once they have come to terms with the Turkish part of their identity, can seek new answers to their questions from independent [[Armenia]].<ref name="RWOB050713"/>}}

In a February 2006 interview with the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], Dink spoke about his 2005 conviction for denigrating Turkishness in a criminal court:
{{quote|"This is a political decision because I wrote about the [[Armenian Genocide]] and they detest that, so they found a way to accuse me of insulting Turks."<ref name="CPJ06SP" />}}

In the same CPJ interview, explained that while he had always been in the sights of Turkish nationalists, the past year had seen an increase in their efforts:
{{quote|<U+201C>The prosecutions are not a surprise for me. They want to teach me a lesson because I am Armenian. They try to keep me quiet.<U+201D><ref name="CPJ06SP"/>}}

His appeal on the ruling that found him guilty was rejected by a Turkish court on May 2006.<ref name="BBC060501"/> Having exhausted internal appeal mechanisms, Dink appealed to the European Court of Human Rights for an overturn of the ruling on January 15th. The appeal is on grounds that Article 301 is against freedom of expression and Dink has been discriminated against because of his Armenian ethnicity. Dink's family has the right to decide whether or not to proceed with the appeal after his death.<ref name="milljan25"/>

In September 2006, another case was opened against Dink on charges of 'denigrating Turkishness' under [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code]], which [[Amnesty International]] considered to be "part of an emerging pattern of harassment against the journalist exercising his right to freedom of expression." <ref name="AmnestyUKSept06"/>  The charge was brought against him by the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office after he reportedly referred to the [[Armenian Genocide|1915 massacre of Armenians]] in the Ottoman Empire as [[genocide]] during a July 14 2006 interview with the [[Reuters]] news agency:<ref name="AmnestyUKSept06"/><ref name="PEN070119"/>
{{quote|"Of course I'm saying it's a genocide, because its consequences show it to be true and label it so. We see that [[Armenian people|people]] who had lived on this soil [[History of Armenia|for 4000 years]] were exterminated by these events."<ref name="AmnestyUKSept06"/>}}

== Death threats and last days==
Dink had a long history of personal threats by Turkish nationalists for his statements on Armenian identity and the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref name="CPJ070119quote" /><ref name="fox070119"/> He regularly received emails with threats to his physical security and he compared himself to a dove, "equally obsessed by what goes-on on my left and right, front and back. My head is just as mobile and fast".<ref name="bbc070120"/> He complained about the indifference of the Turkish government to this atmosphere of terror: "Do you ministers know the price of making someone as scared as a dove?"

In his last column in ''Agos'' of January 10, 2007, Dink complained of the Turkish state propaganda against him which led many Turks to consider him an enemy of Turkey:
{{quote|"It is obvious that those wishing to alienate me and make me weak and defenseless reached their goal. Right now they have brought about a significant circle of people who are not low in number and who regard me as someone <U+201C>insulting Turkish identity<U+201D> due to the dirty and wrong information."<ref name="Agos070124"/>}}

He also complained of the indifference shown by Turkish authorities to provide him with personal security:
{{quote|"The diary and memory of my computer is full of messages from citizens of this circle full of rage and threats.  (Let me note that I regarded one among them posted from Bursa as a close threat and submitted it to Public Prosecutor<U+2019>s office in <U+015E>i<U+015F>li but got no result.)"<ref name="Agos070124"/>}}

== Assassination ==
Despite his complaints, Dink never formally asked for protection from the authorities stating that he didn't want to lead a life being protected all the time. This was also confirmed by his lawyer, Erdal Do<U+011F>an.<ref name="bbc070119"/><ref name="hurriyet5808478"/> A week before the assassination, Dink wrote that he felt "nervous and afraid" because of the intensity of hate mail and threats he had been receiving. In his column in ''Agos'' he had written: "I see myself as frightened, the way a dove might be, but I know that the people in this country would never harm a dove."<ref name="time070119"/>

Dink was assassinated around 12:00 GMT on [[19 January]] [[2007]] as he was returning to the offices of ''Agos'' after having run some errands at a nearby bank.<ref name="hurriyet5808478"/> According to a Turkish news TV channel, the killer introduced himself as a student of [[Ankara University]], and wanted to meet with Mr. Dink, but his request was rejected. It has been later understood that after rejection, he waited in front of a nearby bank for a while.<ref name="cnnturk070120"/><ref name="BBCarrest" /> According to eye witnesses, Dink was shot by a man of 25<U+2013>30 years of age, who fired three shots at Dink's head from the back at point blank range before fleeing the scene on foot. According to the police, the assassin was a man of 18<U+2013>19 years of age. Two men had been taken into custody in the first hours of the police investigation, but were later released.<ref name="DinkAssassinated" /> Another witness, the owner of a restaurant near the ''Agos'' office, said the assassin looked about 20, wore jeans and a cap and shouted "I shot the infidel" as he left the scene <ref name="reuters"/> and Dink's close friend Orhan Alkaya claimed that the three-shot assassination technique was a signature mark of the [[Turkish Hezbollah]].<ref name="milliyet070119"/>

===Capture of the suspected shooter===
One day after the assassination, the police announced that the shooter had been identified in video footage collected through both Istanbul MOBESE electronic surveillance network (4000+ cameras throughout the city) and local security cameras. They later released photos to the public while urging every citizen to aid with the investigation. On the same evening, Istanbul Governor [[Muammer G<U+00FC>ler]] addressed the press to state that special investigation committees were pursuing nearly two dozen leads and the police were analyzing ten thousand phone calls made from the vicinity of the crime scene. 

News agencies reported on Saturday, 18:22 GMT that the shooter had been identified as "[[Og<U+00FC>n Samast]]", a teenager born in 1990 and registered as residing in [[Trabzon]], the same city where barely one year ago the catholic priest [[Andrea Santoro]] was shot dead by a 16-year-old native of the city, in front of the church of Santa Maria of Trabzon, which is a nationalist gathering center.<ref name="BBCarrest"/><ref name="LeSoir"/> In recent years, Trabzon has become an important recruiting place for the ultra-nationalist movement.<ref name="Libe"/> Samast's father identified him from the publicly released photos and alerted the authorities. Six people, including Samast's friend [[Yasin Hayal]], who had been involved in a bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in Trabzon in 2004, were taken into custody and brought to Istanbul.<ref name="bbc070121"/> Later that evening at 19:55 GMT, news of Samast's capture in Samsun was announced.

Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an]] also confirmed that the alleged assassin Og<U+00FC>n Samast had been captured in Samsun, with the assassination weapon on him.

===Funeral===
Dink's funeral service was held on [[January 23]] [[2007]] in the [[Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church]] in the [[Kumkap<U+0131>]] neighborhood of Istanbul. The ceremony planned for Dink's funeral upon his assassination turned to a demonstration where a hundred thousand marched.<ref name="Funeral"/>

During a ceremony in front of the ''[[Agos]]'' office in [[Osmanbey]], Rakel Dink, Hrant Dink's widow, read a letter she had written, addressed to her murdered husband.<ref name="rakeldink"/> Afterwards the crowd walked for eight kilometers to [[Yenikap<U+0131>]] via [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] and [[Aksaray]], while from Taksim Square onwards the coffin was taken directly to [[Kumkap<U+0131>]] for a church service. During the march, many in the crowd carried placards reading "We are all Armenian" and "We are all Hrant Dink" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and also placards stating "[[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|301]] is the murderer". As the crowd passed in front of the party offices of [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] and [[Great Union Party|BBP]], catcalls were heard.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} All leave for police in Istanbul had been cancelled, and the funeral and march proceeded without incidents.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The service was attended by members of the Turkish government, representatives from the Armenian diaspora as well as religious leaders. Although Turkey has no official diplomatic relations with Armenia, upon the invitation Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Abdullah G<U+00FC>l]], the Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister [[Arman Kirakosian]] was present at the funeral.<ref name="milliyet070123"/><ref name="zaman070130"/> Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an|Erdo<U+011F>an]] was not present at the funeral, because he had to attend the scheduled inauguration of the Mount Bolu Tunnel.<ref name="TP070122"/>

After the church services, the hearse made a final tour for the thousands of marchers still gathered at Yenikap<U+0131>, before proceeding to Bal<U+0131>kl<U+0131> Armenian Cemetery in Istanbul's [[Zeytinburnu]] neighborhood, where Dink's body was laid to rest. At the cemetry Rev. Krikor Agabaloglu (Pastor of the Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedikpa<U+015F>a) and Rev. Rene Levonian (Armenian Evangelical World Council's representative) delivered short speeches in Turkish and in Armenian.

===Investigation===
The Istanbul Criminology Department stated that from the empty shells, they were able to determine that the assassination weapon used 7.65 millimeter ammunition and had never been used in another crime.<ref name="ntvmsnbc070121"/>

Ahmet <U+00C7>ok<U+00E7><U+0131>nar, a prosecutor in the city of Samsun told the Anatolia news agency that Samast has confessed to killing Hrant Dink.<ref name="cnnturk070120" /> According to this preliminary news, Samast said the killing was a personal act and did not have any organizational agenda.<ref name="haberturk070120"/>  Samast's uncle Faik Samast has told private NTV television that he didn't think his nephew was capable of acting alone - "He didn't even know his way around Istanbul,"  "This kid was used."<ref name="cnn070121"/> Samast said that he killed Dink for "insulting Turks", and that he doesn't regret it.<ref name="reuters070121"/> According to media reports, Samast is a high school dropout and a possible drug addict.<ref name="cnn070121"/> Later news reports stated that Samast had had no idea of the significance of his act until watching TV coverage, and that he had ended his written confession with an expression of remorse.<ref name="hurriyet-en-5830266"/><ref name="tna-21811"/>

Three people were taken into custody in relation with the murder on the day of the murder.<ref name="IHT070119"/> However, movements tied to the ultra-nationalist movement are currently suspected of carrying out the murder, in particular after the arrest of [[Yasin Hayal]], a militant who passed 11 months in prison  for having taken part in the bombing of a McDonald's in Trabzon in 2004, and of [[Karadeniz Technical University]] student Erhan Tuncel, close to the Alperen organization, the [[neo-fascist]] youth organization associated with the ultra-nationalist and Islamist party [[Great Union Party]] (BBP), created by former members of the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP).<ref name="Libe"/><ref name="Trabzonlegend"/> [[Yasin Hayal]] confessed to telling Samast to kill Dink and supplying the murder weapon, while Erhan Tuncel has been charged as a main instigator of the killing, and allegedly directed both Samast and Hayal.<ref name="Trabzonlegend"/> The BBP has denied any involvement in the assassination.<ref name="hurriyet-en-5830266"/><ref name="tna-21811"/><ref name="BigBrotherErhan"/><ref name="hurriyet5826791"/> Hrant Dink was qualified as a "traitor" by the Turkish far right, and had received up to 2,600 death threats from ultra-nationalist circles.<ref name="LeSoir" /><ref name="assyrian070122"/><ref name="bbc070121" /> According to rumors reported by Turkish newspapers late January 2007, Erhan Tuncel was actually a police informer for Trabzon Police. The rumors also suggested that he warned Trabzon police office before the murder, but that the warnings were ignored.<ref name="sabah070128"/><ref name="hurriyet070129"/><ref name="sabah070130"/><ref name="TNA070130"/>

In a surprising development, eye witnesses of the killing and people who had watched video footage of the killing captured by CCTV declared that a team composed of four to five people were involved, led by a man of about age 40<U+2013>45, among which Yasin Hayal, who was claimed to be identifiable as the one actually pulling the trigger.<ref name="sabah070203"/><ref name="Sabah-hidden"/> The words of one of the witnesses implied that the police had been trying to hide the existence of one revealing video cassette.<ref name="Sabah-hidden"/> Asked whether he thought the group of people behind the assassination of Dink were a small gang or a bigger organization, Turkish minister of Justice [[Cemil <U+00C7>i<U+00E7>ek]] responded by saying, "according to the information and the connections received up to now, it seems that this is an act of organization."<ref name="sabah070203_2"/>

Some newspapers blamed the media that supported nationalist points of view around Hrant Dink's trial for denigrating Turkishness, up to the point of declaring him a traitor. One of those headlines was "Be Proud Of Your Work" ([[Radikal]])
* Columns in Turkish newspapers included Armenian in transliteration: ''Ahparik, Ahparik!'' [Armenian for "brother, brother!"] by Hadi Uluengin in H<U+00FC>rriyet, and ''Tsidesutyun Paregamis!'' [Farewell My Friend!] by Can Dundar in Milliyet.

Later, these placards were protested by the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]]. The leader of MHP described the placards saying "We are all Armenian" as "a freak show organized by those who do not participate in martyr funerals". On the other hand, a party council member of the main-opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]], a member of [[Socialist International]], said "we became ashamed of being Turkish. I am Turkish and I protest the assassination. Maybe we should have carried the placards saying 'We are all Human' instead of 'We are all Armenians'. The placards that say "assassin [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|301]]" are also wrong. As long as we do not want to denigrate Turkishness, we cannot call 301 an assassin."<ref name="Radikal211091"/>
* [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[novelist]], [[Orhan Pamuk]] visited Dink's family in Istanbul on [[January 21]].  "In a sense, we are all responsible for his death," he said. "However, at the very forefront of this responsibility are those who still defend Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. Those who campaigned against him, those who portrayed this sibling of ours as an enemy of Turkey, those who painted him as a target, they are the most responsible in this. And then, in the end, we are all responsible."<ref name="hurriyet070121"/>

====Actions Afterwards====
* H<U+00FC>seyin Yavuzdemir, governor of Trabzon and Re<U+015F>at Altay, chief of police of Trabzon were removed from duty and a special investigation team was sent from Ankara to Trabzon to investigate the situation in the city.<ref name="hurriyet27jan"/>

* Agos, whose normal circulation was about 6,000, was printed 30,000, distributed nationally and was getting ready for a re-print in its first publication since the murder of its editor-in-chief. A group of intellectuals and journalists took part in selling Agos on the streets of Istanbul.<ref name="bia070126"/>
* Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdullah G<U+00FC>l declared in Davos on 28th of January that a change in Article 301 was imminent as it was hindering the reform process in Turkey.<ref name="radikal070128"/>
*  On [[February 1]], [[2007]], the private Turkish television channel ''TGRT'', which was bought by [[Rupert Murdoch]], broadcast video footage of the man accused of shooting Hrant Dink posing proudly behind a Turkish flag, flanked by police officers of both military and security police, allegedly filmed in the police bureau of Samsun where he was taken after his arrest. In the background was a poster bearing the words of [[Kemal Ataturk|Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]]: "The nation's land is sacred. It cannot be left to fate." The video caused shock and consternation as commentators warned it was another sign of the growing power of Turkish ultra-nationalism, as the nation gears up for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year. Ismet Berkan, editor of the liberal newspaper [[Radikal]], said that the release of the video was like killing Mr Dink a second time. It proved, he claimed, "that the murderer and his associates are not alone, that their supporters ... have penetrated all segments of the state." A police spokesperson said an investigation into the video footage and its leaking was under way.<ref name="independent070203"/><ref name="zaman070203"/><ref name="TimesOnline3-2581435"/><ref name="sabah070203_3"/> Rumours of the existence of such footage had been circulating for days, but were officially denied.<ref name="TimesOnline3-2581435"/> In an apparent act of retaliation to the broadcasting of the footage, the [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish General Staff]] canceled the accreditation of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s TGRT, required for attending press events at the staff headquarters.<ref name="milliyet070203"/> The general director of TGRT, Murat Akgiray, and the director responsible for the broadcasting, Bahattin Apak, have resigned.<ref name="haberturk070202"/>

The  protesters marched with Turkish flags, portraits of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and carried placards reading, "We all are Mustafa Kemal. We all are Turks." Among the demonstrators were children wrapped in Turkish flags, chanting nationalistic slogans.<ref name="haberler070204"/>

* [[Armenian National Committee of America]]: "Hrant Dink's murder is tragic proof that the Turkish government - through its campaign of denial, threats and intimidation against the recognition of the Armenian Genocide - continues to fuel the same hatred and intolerance that initially led to this crime against humanity more than 90 years ago," said ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian.<!-- non working --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=1059 |title=ANCA condemns murder of Hrant Dink}}</ref>

====States====

====Human Rights Bodies====
* [[Amnesty International USA]]: "This horrifying assassination silences one of Turkey's bravest human rights defenders. [...] legitimate debate about ideas must be protected. The Turkish government must redouble its efforts to protect human rights defenders and open its political climate to a range of views. Recent legal reforms have brought many areas of Turkish law in line with international human rights standards, but existing limitations on free speech such as Article 301 must be repealed."<ref name="amnestyusa070119"/>
* [[Amnesty International]] (UK): "Amnesty International calls on the Turkish authorities to condemn all forms of intolerance, to uphold the rights of all citizens of the Turkish Republic and to investigate the murder of Hrant Dink thoroughly and impartially, to make the findings of the investigation public - and to bring suspected perpetrators to justice in accordance with international fair trial standards."<ref name="AIUK070119"/>
* [[Human Rights Watch]]: "We are deeply saddened by Hrant Dink's murder. Dink's killing robs Turkey of an important voice of conscience on the need for Turkey to come to terms with its past," said Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director for Human Rights Watch.<ref name="HRW070120"/>
* [[ARTICLE 19]]: <U+201C>The Turkish authorities must also take a very hard look at their own role: their failure to repeal Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, the continuing use of this and other provisions to prosecute writers, journalists and others that dare speak out on taboo topics, and the authorities<U+2019> public criticism of these voices: all of these contribute to creating an environment that legitimizes attacks on freedom of expression, including attacks of a most violent and deadly nature,<U+201D> said Dr. Agn<U+00E8>s Callamard, ARTICLE 19<U+2019>s Executive Director.<ref name="article19070119"/>

====Journalism Organizations====
* [[Reporters Without Borders]]: "This murder will distress and disturb all those who defend the freedom of thought and expression in Turkey and elsewhere," the press freedom organization said. "The Turkish government must weigh the extreme gravity of this crime and ensure that a thorough investigation identifies those responsible as quickly as possible."<ref name="reporters070119"/>
* [[International Federation of Journalists]]: <U+201C>This man has been the target of abuse and threats ever since he dared to express an opinion that challenges an established orthodoxy,<U+201D> said Aidan White, IFJ General Secretary. <U+201C>It is scandalous that he appears to have become the victim of a culture of intolerance that remains deeply rooted in parts of society.<U+201D><ref name="ifj070119"/>
* [[International Press Institute]]: "This is a terrible event for Turkish press freedom. It sends the inevitable signal to all Turkish media that, if you discuss the Armenian massacre in the same terms as Dink, you face not only constant harassment from the authorities, but the possibility of assassination. [...] I think the time has now come for the government to realize that such laws have no place in a modern society. I would also hope that, following Dink<U+2019>s murder, there is an open discussion about these issues leading to an agreement by all sides to consign such laws to Turkish history," said IPI Director Johann P. Fritz.<ref name="IPI070122"/>
* [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]: "Through his journalism Hrant Dink sought to shed light on Turkey<U+2019>s troubled past and create a better future for Turks and Armenians. This earned him many enemies, but he vowed to continue writing despite receiving many threats," said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon. "An assassin has now silenced one of Turkey<U+2019>s most courageous voices. We are profoundly shocked and saddened by this crime, and send our deepest condolences to Hrant Dink<U+2019>s family, colleagues, and friends."<ref name="CPJ070119quote"/>
* [[PEN American Center]]: "We are horrified," said Larry Siems, Director of Freedom to Write and International Programs at PEN American Center. "Hrant Dink was one of the heroes of the nonviolent movement for freedom of expression in Turkey<U+2014>a movement in which writers, editors, and publishers have practiced civil disobedience by defying laws that censored or suppressed important truths in that country. Theirs is one of the most significant human rights movements of our time. Hrant Dink<U+2019>s countrymen can help cement some of the gains he helped win for them by sending a strong, unified message that those responsible must be brought to justice for his murder."<ref name="PEN070119"/>
* [[International PEN]]: "The murder [...] of Armenian-Turkish writer and editor Hrant Dink, the courageous and principled advocate for dialogue and understanding between the Armenian minority and the Turks, is an appalling act. Hrant Dink<U+2019>s fellow writers worldwide express their profound shock at this terrible loss. Dink, whose campaign against the law making it a crime to insult the Turkish State, particularly as it relates to the killings of Armenians in the early years of the last century, has paid the highest price with his own life."  Jiri Grusa, International President of International PEN, the world association of writers, called the murder <U+201C>a symptom of old hatreds that threaten the relationship of all Turkish people to the democratic values shared in Europe and the world.<U+201D><ref name="penintl070119"/>
