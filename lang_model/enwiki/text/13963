The '''Irish Socialist Network''' (ISN) is a [[democratic socialist]] organisation formed in 2001. It is a campaigning organisation which works actively to fight for the rights of Irish workers and to help build a socialist [[Ireland]]. It is based in [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]]. Politically, the ISN locates itself within the Marxist tradition, but it rejects both Leninism and Trotskyism, partly because of its opposition to 'democratic centralist'  organisational structures and to the concept of the 'vanguard' party, which it deems elitist.

The ISN is organised in both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. In July 2007, it was claiming three branches: Dublin Central, Dublin North West and Belfast. It produces a bi-monthly, full-colour free paper called ''Resistance'', the first issue of which was published in July/August 2007. The ISN's Dublin North West branch also produces the "Finglas People", a freesheet that is widely distributed in the area. Much of the group's publications and articles are freely available on its website.

==Campaigning Activity==
The ISN has been involved in many community campaigns playing a role in campaigns against a [[Poll tax]]-like refuse collection charge, commonly known as the 'bin tax', in the Republic of Ireland and a similar water charge in Northern Ireland.

In Autumn [[2003]], members John O'Neill, and Colm Breathnach were sent to [[Mountjoy Prison]] for a month for refusing to abide by a [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] [[injunction]] relating to the blockading of bin lorries. This was part of the [[Anti-Bin Tax Campaign]]. People from other groups, and non-aligned activists also went to prison for varying amounts of time for similar reasons.

The ISN has been deeply involved in the movement against the wars in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and the occupation of [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]. It disaffiliated from the [[Irish Anti-War Movement]] in 2004, and has since joined [[Anti-War Ireland]] - a group committed to anti-imperialism, a diversity of tactics in bringing an end to imperialism, democratic internal structures, non-sectarian behavior, and competence in its activity. One ISN member, Fintan Lane, spent 45 days in jail in 2003-4 as a result of his participation in a mass trespass against the war at Shannon airport, which is currently a hub airport for the US military on its way to Iraq.

The ISN continues to be active in campaigns against [[fascism]], [[racism]], low pay exploitation and religious [[sectarianism]]. The group also advocates environmentalism and supports the rights of workers, women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals.

==Electoral Activity==

The Irish Socialist Network ran John O'Neill as a candidate in the [[2004]] local elections ([[Finglas]] [[Ward (politics)|ward]]).

The Irish Socialist Network is a group of social revolutionaries, who wish to fundamentally overturn capitalism and its political superstructure. It does not see its role as that of radical social reformers, who wish simply to extend democratic rights and fight for social change within the dominant socio-economic formation. Although arguing and fighting for progressive reforms, the ISN does not view these as a maximal objective.
