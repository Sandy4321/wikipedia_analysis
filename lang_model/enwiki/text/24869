The '''2011 Egyptian protests''' are an ongoing series of street [[political demonstration|demonstrations]], marches, [[political rally|rallies]], acts of civil disobedience, riots, and violent clashes that began in [[Egypt]] on 25 January 2011, a day selected to coincide with the [[National Police Day (Egypt)|National Police Day]] holiday.<ref name="AFP-egyptbraces"/> The protests began with tens of thousands marching in [[Cairo]] and a string of other cities in Egypt.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/net-down-special-forces-deployed-in-cairo-as-egypt-braces-for-protests/story-e6frg6so-1225996200388 "Net down, special forces deployed in Cairo as Egypt braces for protests"] - ''News Limited'' - Retrieved 1 February 2011.</ref> While localised protests had been common in previous years, the 2011 protests have been the largest demonstrations seen in Egypt since the [[1977 Egyptian Bread Riots|1977 Bread Riots]] and unprecedented in scope,<ref name="Dan Murphy 0125">{{Cite news|last=Murphy|first=Dan|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Backchannels/2011/0125/Inspired-by-Tunisia-Egypt-s-protests-appear-unprecedented|title=Inspired by Tunisia, Egypt's protests appear unprecedented|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> drawing participants from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds and faiths.<ref name="nyt-fahim"/>

International response to the protests has been mixed, though most have called for some sort of peaceful protests on both sides and moves toward reform. Mostly Western governments also expressed concern for the situation. Many governments have issued travel advisories and begun making attempts at evacuating their citizens from the country.

Mubarak dissolved his government and appointed military figure and former head of the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate]] [[Omar Suleiman]] as Vice-President in an attempt to quell dissent. Mubarak asked aviation minister and former chief of Egypt's Air Force, [[Ahmed Shafik]], to form a new government. Opposition to the Mubarak regime has coalesced around [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], with all major opposition groups supporting his role as a negotiator for some form of transitional unity government.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shadid|first=Anthony and David D.

===Economic climate===
{{Main|Economy of Egypt}}

Egypt's economy was highly centralized during the rule of former President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] but opened up considerably under former President Anwar Sadat and current President Hosni Mubarak. Cairo from 2004 to 2008 aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment and facilitate GDP growth, but postponed further economic reforms because of global economic turmoil. The international [[economic downturn]] slowed Egypt's GDP growth to 4.5 percent in 2009. In 2010, analysts assessed the government of Prime Minister [[Ahmed Nazif]] would need to restart economic reforms to attract foreign investment, boost growth, and improve economic conditions for the broader population. Despite high levels of economic growth over the past few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remained poor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/egypt/egypt_economy.html|title=Egypt Economy 2010|source=[[CIA World Factbook]]|date=27 January 2010|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref>
In late 2010 around 40 percent of Egypt's population of just under 80&nbsp;million lived on the fiscal income equivalent of roughly US$2 per day and a large part of the population  relied on subsidised goods.<ref name="AFP-egyptbraces"/> According to the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], the basic problem Egypt has is unemployment driven by a demographic bulge: with the number of new people entering the job force at about 4 percent a year, unemployment in Egypt is almost 10 times as high for college graduates as it is for people who have gone through elementary school, particularly educated urban youth, who are precisely the people currently seen out in the streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/02/01/pm-the-long-term-challenges-egypt-must-overcome/|title=The long-term economic challenges Egypt must overcome|work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===

The [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] enjoy a better reputation with the public than police, the former perceived as a professional body protecting the country, the latter accused of systemic corruption and illegitimate violence.

===Protester demands===
Opposition and civil society activists have called for changes to a number of legal and constitutional provisions which affect elections. Specifically they call for:
*Amendment of Article 76 of the Constitution to make it easier for party and independent candidates to get on the presidential ballot.
*Amendment of Article 77 to establish term limits for the presidency, which were removed from the Constitution in 1981.
*Amendment of Article 88 to restore full judicial supervision of elections. This would help tame election fraud and vote rigging, which are common in Egyptian elections.
*Amendment of Law 177 of 2005 in order to facilitate the formation of new political parties.
*Amendment of Article 179: Amendments in 2007 to Article 179 included an "anti-terrorism" measure, which allows for arbitrary arrest, searches and wiretapping without warrant, and transfer of any civilian court case of the president<U+2019>s choosing to military tribunals.  Unlike the Emercency law, it is a permanent measure and not a temporary measure requiring parlimentary approval.

In the Spring 2010, Mohamed Elbaradei began circulating a petition in the runup to the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2010]] calling for 7 specific reforms:
#End the state of emergency.
#Ensure full judicial supervision of elections.
#Provide for domestic and international monitoring of elections.
#Ensure that all candidates have sufficient access to the media, particularly during the presidential election campaign.
#Allow Egyptians abroad to vote through embassies and consulates.
#Work toward a political system built on democracy and social justice.
#Provide the right to nomination for political office without obstacles, in accordance with Egypt<U+2019>s obligations under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights; limit the president to two terms.
#Allow voting by national identification card. These measures will require amending articles 76, 77, and 88 of the Constitution as soon as possible.<ref name="egyptelections">{{cite web|first=Matthew|url=http://egyptelections.carnegieendowment.org/2010/09/01/constitutional-and-legal-framework|title=Constitutional and Legal Framework|work=[[Carnegie Endowment]] |location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref>

In the late evening (11:00&nbsp;pm local Egyptian time) President Mubarak proclaimed that he did not intend to run for another term in the next election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charter.net/video/play/429076/channels/cnn |title=Mubarak Video|publisher=Charter.net |date= |accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref> Mubarak said he would stay in office to ensure a peaceful transition to the next election, [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|set for September 2011]], and promised to make political reforms.

Mubarak said that peaceful protests were transformed into "unfortunate clashes, mobilised and controlled by political forces that wanted to escalate and worsen the situation". Mubarak called upon the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]] to change the limit terms of the presidency and change the requirements to run for president.

The Prosecutor General followed up travel bans and frozen bank accounts on former ministers and government officials with the same for former Minister of Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid. Rashid, in a phone call with Al Arabiya, stated: "I returned from Davos to Egypt because of the current situation in Egypt. The new Prime Minister had contacted me for the same position in the new cabinet, I refused because I want fresh blood". Regarding the travel ban, he commented, "I had no idea about the accusations, I served for six and half years and I am completely ready to face any accusation. No one had informed me of this decision and I heard it from the news." Rashid enjoys a good reputation among Egyptian people and was a possible candidate for Prime Minister before the protests.

The Egyptian state also cracked down on the media, shutting down internet access<ref>Cowie, James (27 January 2011).

Egyptian and foreign equity and commodity markets also reacted negatively to the increasing instability.

===National Dialogue===
Vice President Omar Suleiman was ordered by Mubarak to conduct negotiations with opposition groups. Among the major ideas circulated was a compromise in which Suleiman would be delegated all of Mubarak's authorities for an interim period and Mubarak would stay on as an [[emeritus|honourary]] president for that period.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Suleiman-mulling-figurehead-role-for-Mubarak/Article1-658783.aspx 'Suleiman mulling figurehead role for Mubarak'], hindustantimes, February 05, 2011</ref>
