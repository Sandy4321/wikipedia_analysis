'''Chyluria''', also called '''chylous urine''', is a medical condition involving the presence of [[chyle]] in the [[urine]] stream,<ref>[http://www.pon.nic.in/fil-free/chronic.html#chyluria Chronic filariasis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which results in urine appearing milky white.<ref>{{GPnotebook|490012696}}</ref> It is a condition that is more prevalent among people of [[African continent|Africa]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Chyluria appearance is irregular and intermittent.It may last several days, weeks or even months. There are several factors that trigger Chyluria recurrence.

==Causes==
Chyluria is often caused by [[filariasis]] due to the parasite ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'', a thready [[nematode]] which lodges the [[lymph]] channels.<ref name="Dunavan">{{cite magazine| last=Dunavan | first=Claire Panosian | date=2008-05-22 | title=The white urine that held the key | journal=Discover Magazine | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/22-the-white-urine-that-held-the-key/}}</ref> Another cause is pregnancy or childbirth.
Patients claimed that Chyluria occurred after overwork. Mental tension, sadness, annoyance, anger etc. could also produce attack of Chyluria.

In the United States, one of the most common causes is partial nephrectomy or thermal ablation of a kidney lesion.

==Symptoms==
Once the lymph channels are blocked, one may open into the kidney [[hilum of kidney|hilum]] or [[ureter]] or sometimes into the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and chyle can leak into the urinary tract resulting in milky white urine. Blood sometimes mixes with the urine resulting in haemato-chyluria.

Usually the condition is self-limiting and can sometimes lead to complications. If left untreated, chronic chyluria can lead to [[malnutrition]] and [[vitamin deficiency]].

==Treatment==
An anti-filarial drug, such as [[diethylcarbamazine]], may be prescribed. Severe damage to lymph channels may require [[surgery]].
Sclerotherapy with instillation of 1%  of silver nitrate or  povidone iodine (2ml of 5% + 8ml distilled water )
