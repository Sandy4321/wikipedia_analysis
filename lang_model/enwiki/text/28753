'''Benjamin Todd "Ben" Roethlisberger''' ({{IPA-en|<U+02C8>r<U+0252><U+03B8>l<U+0268>sb<U+025C>r<U+0261><U+0259>r|pron}}; born March 2, 1982), nicknamed '''Big Ben''', is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[National Football League]]. He was drafted by the Steelers in the first round (11th overall) in the [[2004 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami University (Oxford, Ohio)]].

Roethlisberger earned the [[National Football League Rookie of the Year Award|AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year]] in 2004 and his first [[Pro Bowl]] selection in [[2008 Pro Bowl|2007]]. He became the youngest Super Bowl-winning quarterback in NFL history, helping lead the Steelers, in his second professional season, to a 21<U+2013>10 victory over the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Super Bowl XL]] at the age of 23. Roethlisberger led the Steelers to a second Super Bowl title in four seasons as they defeated the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in [[Super Bowl XLIII]], 27<U+2013>23, after completing a game-winning touchdown pass to [[Santonio Holmes]] in the final 35 seconds.

Roethlisberger has been one of the most efficient passers in NFL history. He currently ranks 8th all-time in NFL passer rating (92.5), 5th in yards per attempt (8.04), and 12th in completion percentage (63.07%) among quarterbacks with a minimum of 1500 career attempts. He has the 4th highest career winning percentage (.704) as a starter in the regular season among quarterbacks with a minimum of 90 starts.

Off the field, Roethlisberger has been involved in high-profile incidents, including a nearly fatal motorcycle accident in 2006 and sexual assault allegations in [[Lake Tahoe]] in 2008 and in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], in 2010. Neither allegation resulted in charges being filed; however, the latter act resulted in Roethlisberger being suspended for six games (reduced to four) under the NFL's [[National Football League player conduct controversy|personal conduct policy]] for the start of the 2010 season.

Known for playing outside the [[passing pocket|quarterback pocket]] in what he calls "backyard football",<ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/9101154/Big-Ben-at-the-top-of-his-game?CMP=OTC-K9B140813162&ATT=5 Sorting the Super Bowl Pile: Big Ben]</ref> Roethlisberger is often compared to his childhood idol, former [[Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[John Elway]], due to the similar styles and fourth-quarter comebacks.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/121778-the-humility-of-a-champion-ben-roethlisberger The Humility of a Champion: Ben Roethlisberger]</ref>{{Dubious|Elway comparison|date=February 2011}} Roethlisberger also grew up idolizing [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh area]] native [[Joe Montana]]. Roethlisberger wears number 7 in Elway's honor.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/22/AR2006012201255.html Michael Wilbon - Big Ben, Already Like Clockwork - washingtonpost.com]</ref>

Roethlisberger is engaged to Ashley Harlan, a 2004 graduate of Laurel High School in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania|New Castle]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.ncnewsmedia.com/archive/2011/01Jan/Big_Ben/image0.htm Confirmed - New Castle News]</ref>

==Early years==
Roethlisberger was born in [[Lima, Ohio]].<ref>[http://www.forecaster.info/post-gazette/football/player.cgi?6567 "Player Bio]. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</ref> At [[Findlay High School]] in [[Findlay, Ohio]], Roethlisberger was captain of the football, basketball, and baseball teams. In baseball he batted .300.

Roethlisberger did not play quarterback until his senior year, giving way to the coach's son, Ryan Hite. Instead, Roethlisberger played wide receiver because, as coach [[Cliff Hite]] explained to the [[Toledo Blade]], "My son throwing to Ben was a better combination."<ref name="tb1">[http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040418/SPORTS09/40418012 Hindsight makes Hite's sight look blurry]</ref> Ryan Hite went on to play wide receiver in college at Division III [[Denison University]]. Hite told the [[Toledo Blade]] regarding the decision to start his son at quarterback over Roethlisberger: "I'm a nationally known knucklehead."<ref name="tb1" />

==College career==

Roethslisberger played college quarterback at [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]]. At Miami, he got a chance to start as a redshirt freshman and started three years of Division I college football despite only a single year experience as a high school quarterback.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Roethlisberger holds every major passing record at the school and a number of passing records in the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC). He played just three years before joining the NFL. 

As a redshirt freshman, Roethlisberger threw for over 3,100 yards. In 2002, he threw more than 3,200 yards, and in 2003, he threw more than 4,400 yards. In 2003, Roethlisberger led the Miami RedHawks to an unbeaten record in the MAC, a No. 10 ranking in the [[Associated Press]] poll and a 49-28 victory over Louisville in the [[2003 GMAC Bowl]].<ref name=autogenerated2>http://www.thecourier.com/BigBenStories/articles/unendingbattle.htm</ref>

His number was retired by the RedHawks in 91st annual homecoming on Saturday, Oct. 13, 2007, with festivities including the RedHawks football game against Bowling Green; Roethlisberger becoming only the third athlete in Miami football history to have his jersey number retired, joining [[John Pont]] and [[Bob Hitchens]]. It was the first time in 34 years Miami retired a football jersey number.<ref>[http://muredhawks.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100907aaa.html A Battle of MAC Undefeateds as RedHawks Host Falcons in Homecoming Clash]</ref><ref>[http://muredhawks.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101007aac.html Miami to Honor Ben Roethlisberger and Terry Hoeppner at Football Game on Saturday]</ref>

===The Draft===
The success of the 2003 Miami Redhawks led to the expectation that Roethlisberger would be drafted early. During the GMAC Bowl, commentators discussed some of his skills that would translate to success in the NFL.

At the combine, Roethlisberger scored a 25 on the [[Wonderlic]].<ref>[http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/NFLDraft/Draft+Insider/2004/Wonderlic.htm 2004 Wonderlic Test Results]</ref> Roethlisberger was one of the players invited to attend the draft along with others in the "Green Room" and was featured on the show "Hey Rookie Welcome to the NFL."

===Quarterback class of 2004===
Roethlisberger was one of four quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft along with [[Philip Rivers]], [[Eli Manning]], and [[J.P. Losman]]. Due to the trade between Manning and Rivers, Roethlisberger was the highest-drafted quarterback that year that played for the team that drafted him. Before [[Paul Tagliabue]] announced the selection of Roethlisberger, the phone call he received by Steelers head coach [[Bill Cowher]] was shown live on [[ESPN]], confirming the team's selection before the official announcement.

Roethlisberger, Rivers, and Manning have been voted to the Pro Bowl since becoming starters, none have produced a season with a losing record (although each has had an 8-8 season), and Roethlisberger and Manning have each won a Super Bowl. They have been compared favorably to the [[Quarterback class of 1983]], which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks [[Dan Marino]], [[John Elway]], and [[Jim Kelly]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/don_banks/08/28/qbs/index.html Best quarterback class ever? Trio from '04 makes its case over '83]</ref>

==Professional career==
[[Image:Ben Roethlisberger - snap.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Roethlisberger takes a snap against the Bengals in 2006.]]
Roethlisberger was selected 11th overall in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. On August 4, 2004, he signed a six-year contract worth $22.26 million in salaries and bonuses, with an additional $17.73 million available via incentives. He was touted by then-Steelers coach [[Bill Cowher]] in a press conference as a franchise quarterback.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/story?id=09000d5d80e973a2&template=with-video-with-comments&confirm=true Pittsburgh proves it: Franchise QB = long-term success]</ref>

On March 4, 2008, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Roethlisberger agreed to an eight-year, $102 million contract.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08064/862296-66.stm Steelers break bank for Big Ben]</ref> Roethlisberger had two years left on his original that he signed after the draft. He has stated that he wants to retire as a Steeler.<ref>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_547648.html Roethlisberger wants to stick with Steelers]</ref>

===2004 season===
Roethlisberger did not immediately step in as the starting quarterback for the Steelers. He was the No. 3 QB behind [[Tommy Maddox]] and [[Charlie Batch]]. When Batch was injured in the preseason, however, Roethlisberger moved up to no. 2. Maddox started, and won, the season opener against the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] and started versus the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]. But after an ineffective outing and third-quarter injury to Maddox, Roethlisberger stepped in for his first NFL action. Despite spurring a mild comeback, the Steelers lost the game. Maddox's injury changed the Steelers' original plan for Roethlisberger, which was for him to sit on the bench or play sparingly during the first season or two in order to learn the team's system. Instead, he started the third game of the season.

As a rookie, he went 13-0 in the regular season (14<U+2013>1 including playoffs) as a starting quarterback, helping the Steelers become the first AFC team to have 15 wins (2<U+2013>1 under Maddox [first two and last game], 13<U+2013>0 under Roethlisberger) in a single regular season, surpassing former Steeler [[Mike Kruczek]] for the record for the best start by a rookie (6-0) and exceeding the mark for total wins as a rookie, set by [[Chris Chandler]] and [[Joe Ferguson]]. On January 5, 2005, Roethlisberger was unanimously selected as the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year]] by the [[Associated Press]], the first quarterback in 34 years to be so honored.

One of Roethlisberger's biggest games was when he led the Steelers to a 34<U+2013>20 victory over the defending [[Super Bowl]] champion and previously undefeated [[New England Patriots]], ending their NFL-record 21-game winning streak. He completed 18 of 24 pass attempts for 196 yards, two TDs and no turnovers. The week after that game, the Steelers defeated the also previously undefeated [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 27<U+2013>3. Roethlisberger was 11 of 18 for 183 yards, with two TDs and one interception.

In his first nationally-televised game on Sunday Night Football, he led the Steelers to a 17<U+2013>16 victory over the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. He was near-perfect on the night, completing 14 of 17 passes for 226 yards and two TDs. Jeff Reed's 37-yard field goal in the final minute gave the Steelers and Roethlisberger their tenth straight win.

Two weeks later, Roethlisberger faced off against the New York Giants and the no. 1 overall pick of the 2004 draft, [[Eli Manning]]. Roethlisberger posted his first career 300-yard passing game, with 18 of 28 passes for 316 yards and a TD. He led his fifth game-winning drive of the season, capping a drive with a Jerome Bettis TD run for a 33<U+2013>30 victory. Eli Manning threw an interception to seal the game for Pittsburgh.

In the divisional playoffs against the [[New York Jets]], Roethlisberger threw two interceptions. One interception was returned for a touchdown, and the other was thrown with 2:03 left in the fourth quarter, which set up a potential game-winning field goal by Jets kicker [[Doug Brien]]. Brien missed the kick as time expired (his second missed kick in the last two minutes of the game), forcing the game into overtime. In overtime, Roethlisberger led the Steelers down the field and put them in position for the game-winning field goal, a 33-yard attempt that was made by [[Jeff Reed (football player)|Jeff Reed]], sending the Steelers into the AFC Championship for the fourth time in 10 years.

On January 23, 2005 in the [[NFL playoffs, 2004-05#AFC: New England Patriots 41, Pittsburgh Steelers 27|AFC Championship Game]] in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger completed 14 of 24 pass attempts for 226 yards and two TDs, but he also threw three costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown by [[Rodney Harrison]]. The Steelers lost the game to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, by a score of 41<U+2013>27.

===2005 Super Bowl season===
[[Image:Roethlisberger-Bettis-Berman.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Roethlisberger signs autographs at Super Bowl XL media day.]]

In the 2005 regular season, the Steelers finished 11-5. After securing an AFC wild card spot en route to victory in the Super Bowl, the Steelers pulled off upsets at Indianapolis and Denver in the AFC playoffs in addition to wins over higher seeds Cincinnati and Seattle.

During the course of the regular 2005 season, Roethlisberger missed four games due to various knee injuries. The Steelers went 9-3 with Roethlisberger at quarterback and 2-2 without him. He led the league in Yards Per Attempt with an 8.90, and finished third in passer rating behind [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Carson Palmer]] with a 98.6.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/statistics?stat=pass&sort=rat&league=nfl&season=2&year=2005 ESPN - NFL Football Statistics and League Leaders], ESPN.com</ref>

The Super Bowl run began on January 8, 2006 as Roethlisberger helped lead the Steelers to a playoff win over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]&mdash;an AFC North rival that had beaten the Steelers by seven points in the regular season to win the division championship. The rematch featured two teams with identical records, having split their regular season series since each team won on the road. Early in the game on Carson Palmer's first throw, a tackle by former Steeler [[Kimo von Oelhoffen]] resulted in Palmer's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) being completely torn. The Bengals' backup quarterback, [[Jon Kitna]], came in and led the Bengals to leads of 10-0 and 17-7. However, the 17-7 lead midway through the second quarter would be the last time in the 2005 postseason that the Steelers would trail an opponent by more than three points. After Kitna failed to produce, the Steelers took advantage by taking the next 24 straight points, and the win, in a 31-17 victory in Cincinnati.

Their second road win came on January 15. Roethlisberger led the Steelers against the [[Indianapolis Colts]], the NFL's top team throughout the season and a heavy favorite to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger threw for 197 yards and recorded a game-saving tackle on Colts' defensive back [[Nick Harper (American football)|Nick Harper]], who had just recovered a [[Jerome Bettis]] [[fumble]] with less than two minutes left in the game. Pittsburgh led early but had to survive a Colts comeback to win 21-18, after an errant call that the NFL later admitted was a mistake,<ref name=nfl>[http://www.realfootball365.com/nfl/articles/nfl-blown-call160106.php NFL Football - NFL News - Realfootball365.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which overturned a [[Troy Polamalu]] interception that would have secured the game for the Steelers. Roethlisberger's tackle on Harper, dubbed by many as The Tackle II or The Immaculate Redemption, was compared by many to "[[Immaculate Reception|The Immaculate Reception]]" in 1972, when [[Franco Harris]] made a miraculous reception and scored the game-winning touchdown against the [[Oakland Raiders]]. The victory marked the first time in playoff history that a sixth-seeded NFL playoff team defeated the top-seeded team.

On January 22, 2006, the Steelers defeated the [[Broncos]] 34-17 in Denver to win the AFC Championship and advance to Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger completed 21 of 29 passes for 275 yards and threw two touchdown passes and scored one TD himself on a four-yard [[Play action pass|play-action]] [[Bootleg play|bootleg]]. His run was the last touchdown of the game, sealing the win for the Steelers.

The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] won Super Bowl XL 21-10 over the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in Detroit on February 5, 2006. Roethlisberger had one of the worst passing games of his career, completing just nine of 21 passes for 123 yards and two interceptions; his [[passer rating]] of 22.6 was the lowest in Super Bowl history by a winning quarterback. Though he did convert eight third-down situations in the game to help the Steelers win, none of them was bigger than his 37-yard pass to Super Bowl XL MVP Hines Ward on a third-and-28 that set up the Steelers' first TD (a one-yard quarterback sneak by Roethlisberger on third and goal). With the victory, Roethlisberger, at 23 years old, became the youngest quarterback to win the [[Super Bowl]], a record previously held by [[Tom Brady]] of the New England Patriots.

===2006 season===
[[Image:Ben Roethlisberger Steelers cropped.jpg|thumb|270px|Roethlisberger drops back against [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in 2006. Steelers won 45-7.]]
After an off-season motorcycle crash in which he was seriously injured, Roethlisberger missed the opening game of the 2006 season after having an emergency [[Appendicectomy|appendectomy]] on September 3. Backup [[Charlie Batch]] started and led the Steelers to a victory over Miami. Roethlisberger played the following game against Jacksonville on [[Monday Night Football]]. His return resulted in a sub-par performance as he threw two interceptions with no touchdowns in a 9-0 loss. In week three, Roethlisberger completed fewer than half of his passes for three interceptions and no touchdowns in a 28-20 loss to the Bengals. The final interception came in the final seconds of the game, in the end zone, ending Pittsburgh's comeback attempt.

In a week-five game against the [[San Diego Chargers]] on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]], Roethlisberger looked sharp throughout the first half, leading three scoring drives. However, in the second half, he threw two interceptions, both of which shifted momentum away from the Steelers and led to the Chargers' 23-13 win. In week six against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], Roethlisberger had his first big game of the season, completing 16 of 19 passes for 238 yards with two touchdowns (his first of the year) and no interceptions during a 45-7 rout of the Chiefs. During week seven in Atlanta, Roethlisberger continued his success, going 16 of 22 for 237 yards and three TDs. But during the third quarter, Roethlisberger was helped off the field after suffering a concussion following a controversial hit by Falcons defensive end [[Patrick Kerney]]. Roethlisberger was replaced by Charlie Batch, and the Steelers went on to lose 41-38 in overtime.

On October 29 against the Oakland Raiders, Roethlisberger threw four interceptions in a 20-13 upset loss. The loss was his fifth of the season&mdash;two more than he had in his first two seasons combined as a starter&mdash;and gave him a total of 11 INTs, versus just six TDs, on the season. In a week-nine rematch of the 2005 AFC championship game against Denver, Roethlisberger threw a career-high 433 yards but had three of the six Steelers turnovers in a 31-20 loss. Roethlisberger and the Steelers got back on a winning track in a home game a week later against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. He passed for 265 yards and three TDs in a 38-31 win.

In week 11, Roethlisberger overcame three first-half INTs by throwing for 224 yards and two TDs in the fourth quarter, leading the Steelers to score 21 points and come back to beat the [[Cleveland Browns]] 24-20. The following week, Roethlisberger and the Steelers were held scoreless in a 27-0 loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Roethlisberger finished 21 of 41 for 214 yards and two INTs. He was sacked nine times, including once by Ravens linebacker [[Bart Scott]], which sent him to the sidelines briefly. He also fumbled once, which the Ravens returned for a TD in the second half. Roethlisberger bounced back the following game, throwing for 198 yards and two TDs in a 20-3 victory over Tampa Bay.

Pittsburgh kept their playoff hopes alive in week 14 with a 27-7 victory against the Browns. Roethlisberger went 11 of 21 for 225 yards with one TD, and rushed for one more. In week 15, Roethlisberger threw for 140 yards and a TD in a 37-3 rout of the [[Carolina Panthers]]. The following week, Baltimore eliminated Pittsburgh from the playoffs. In the 31-7 defeat, Roethlisberger was intercepted twice and threw for 156 yards.

Roethlisberger ended the season on a good note by defeating the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] 23-17 in overtime in what would be Bill Cowher's final game as Steelers coach. He was 19 for 28 passing with 280 yards, one TD, and one INT. In overtime, Roethlisberger completed a slant pass to rookie Santonio Holmes, who went 67 yards for the game-winning TD. This win eliminated the Bengals from playoff contention.

===2007 season===

'''Week 4 at [[Arizona Cardinals]] (L 21-14)''': Roethlisberger looked to get a win over his former offensive coordinator [[Ken Whisenhunt]], now the head coach of the Cardinals. However, Roethlisberger had his first loss of the season as he was intercepted twice; once in the red zone, and then on a desperation pass with six seconds left in the game.<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/gametracker/recap/NFL_20070930_PIT@ARI "Cards' QB carousel continues, but Whisenhunt gets win over former team"] CBSSports.com</ref>

In week five, he had a good performance despite having two top wide receivers, Hines Ward and Santonio Holmes, out due to injury. Roethlisberger completed 18 of 22 passes for 206 yards and a touchdown pass to Heath Miller in the first quarter.

[[Image:Ben Roethlisberger throwback.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Roethlisberger in a Steelers' throwback jersey during 500th franchise win]]

In [[2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season#Week 9 .2811.2F5.2F07.29: vs. Baltimore Ravens|week 9]] against the [[Baltimore Ravens]], Roethlisberger threw for a career-high five touchdowns, which tied a team record held by [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Mark Malone]] in a 38-7 victory over the Ravens on [[Monday Night Football]]. All five touchdowns were thrown in the first half, making Roethlisberger one of two quarterbacks in the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]] (the other being [[Tom Brady]]), and only the fifth quarterback since the [[NFL-AFL merger|1970 merger]], to accomplish such a feat. He also posted a perfect 158.3 [[Quarterback rating|passer rating]] in that game.

The following Sunday, Roethlisberger continued to shine when he erased a 15-point deficit against the Browns. With the Steelers trailing 21-16 in the fourth quarter and facing a third-and-10 from the Cleveland 30-yard line, Roethlisberger scrambled up the middle of the field for a 30-yard TD run (the longest run of his career at that point). He then completed a two-point conversion pass to Hines Ward. After the Browns returned the ensuing kickoff for a TD, Roethlisberger again had to drive the offense with a four-point deficit. This time he made three crucial plays on third down: an 18-yard pass to Santonio Holmes on third-and-six, a 20-yard pass to Heath Miller on a third-and-18, and a 10-yard scramble on third-and-nine. Roethlisberger capped off the drive with a short TD pass to [[Heath Miller]], which proved to be the game winner.

In week 12, Roethlisberger set a Steelers record, completing 85.7% of his passes (18 of 21) as the Steelers beat the Miami Dolphins 3-0, a feat made all the more remarkable given the weather conditions. [[Pittsburgh]] was hit with a torrential storm, delaying the game 30 minutes due to lightning, while turning the new sod on the field, laid earlier that week, into a soggy mess. In many parts of the field, players sunk several inches with each step.

During the week 15 game versus the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], Roethlisberger threw his 29th TD pass of the season, to [[Nate Washington]], breaking the team single-season TD pass record previously held by Hall of Famer [[Terry Bradshaw]].

To cap his comeback season, Roethlisberger was selected to his first Pro Bowl, joining five other Steelers teammates on the AFC squad.

With the injury to Willie Parker, the Steelers were never able to mount a rushing attack as the backs finished with 22 carries for 30 yards. The Steelers trailed 28-10 to start the 4th quarter, and were facing a 4th & 12 at the Jaguar 37 yard line. Roethlisberger completed a quick slant against the blitz to Santonio Holmes, who broke a tackle and scored to make it 28-17. Roethlisberger led a TD drive on each of the next two Steeler possessions as they took a 29-28 lead with just over six minutes remaining. However, they failed to convert the two-point conversion both times, and the Jaguars were able to get the game-winning FG after Jacksonville QB [[David Garrard]] scrambled for 32 yards on a fourth-and-two play. In the second half alone, Roethlisberger completed 17 of 23 passes for 263 yards and 2 TD passes. Roethlisberger did get the ball back with twenty-nine seconds left, but was sacked for the sixth time in the game and fumbled.<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/gametracker/recap/NFL_20080105_JAC@PIT "Last-minute field goal helps Jags stave off Steelers comeback bid"] CBSSports.com</ref>

===Motorcycle accident===
{{wikinews|Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Roethlisberger hospitalized after motorcycle accident}}

On Monday, June 12, 2006, at 11:17 a.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] ([[UTC-4]]), Roethlisberger was involved in a motorcycle accident near the intersection of 10th Street and Second Avenue near downtown Pittsburgh, in which he was not wearing his helmet. Roethlisberger did not have a valid Pennsylvania motorcycle license at the time of the accident, only a temporary permit that he had obtained after moving to Pittsburgh which had expired in March.<ref>http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/9364467/detail.html</ref>

Roethlisberger was traveling east on Second Avenue when a [[Chrysler New Yorker]] made a left turn in front of the motorcycle and onto the [[South Tenth Street Bridge]]<ref name=benbridge>[http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/9356067/detail.html "Roethlisberger Undergoes Surgery After Bike Crash"]</ref> when the accident occurred. According to an eyewitness, Roethlisberger went over the handlebars of his bike, a 2005 [[Suzuki GSX1300R|Suzuki Hayabusa]],<ref name=benbike>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/steelers/s_457685.html "Roethlisberger seriously injured"]. [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] 12 June 2006.</ref> shattering the windshield of the car with his head. The eyewitness reports claimed Roethlisberger tried to get up but was bleeding from the head.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2480830 "Big Ben in serious condition after motorcycle accident"]. [[ESPNEWS|ESPN.com]]. 12 June 2006. Retrieved 12 June 2006.</ref> Reports from the scene and news media indicated that the accident was serious but "not life- or career-threatening," though Roethlisberger would later relate in interviews that paramedics on the scene stopped the bleeding in his throat just in time to save his life.<ref name=bencrash>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13279232/ "Big Ben in surgery after motorcycle crash"]. [[MSNBC]]. 12 June 2006. Retrieved 12 June 2006.</ref>

After the accident, the shift commander for the [[Allegheny County]] emergency service described Roethlisberger as "alert and conscious."<ref name=bencrash/> He was transported to [[Mercy Hospital (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Mercy Hospital]] and was described as being in "serious but stable" condition in the operating room.

Police sources have indicated that Roethlisberger suffered fractures to the jaw and right [[sinus cavity]], as well as a nine-inch laceration to the back of the head, the loss of two teeth, and several chipped teeth. His facial injuries were severe enough that witnesses on the scene did not immediately recognize him, even after he identified himself as "Ben."<ref>"[http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/9356067/detail.html Bike Crash Leaves Roethlisberger In Serious Condition]", ThePittsburghChannel.com, posted June 12, 2006, accessed June 12, 2006.</ref>

Upon arriving at [[Mercy Hospital (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Mercy Hospital]], he went immediately into surgery, where he remained for more than seven hours. The broken bones in his face were repaired. The subsequent news conference with the hospital staff was brief but confirmed early reports that the most serious injuries were to the head and face. There was no neck, spinal, or brain damage found. After surgery, at approximately noon on June 13, 2006, Roethlisberger was upgraded to fair condition.<ref name=bencrash/><ref name=espn>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2482701 ESPN - Roethlisberger likely to be able to play this season - NFL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

The most serious injuries to Roethlisberger were a broken upper and lower jaw and a broken nose. Roethlisberger was expected to make a full recovery in time for the opening game of the season.

In the wake of [[Kellen Winslow II]]'s crashing of his motorcycle in May 2005, Roethlisberger had been criticized by various NFL members and the media for not wearing a helmet while riding. Even Roethlisberger's coach, Bill Cowher, lectured him about motorcycle safety. Former Steeler [[Terry Bradshaw]] warned Roethlisberger personally when he visited the Steelers' training camp at [[Saint Vincent College]] in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], [[Pennsylvania]], and on television, saying, "Ride it when you retire."<ref name=bencrash/> In a segment put together by ESPN following Winslow's accident, Roethlisberger had said he did not wear a helmet because it was not required by law, adding, "You're just more free when you're out there and there's no helmet on." Transcripts of the interview recall Roethlisberger telling [[Suzy Kolber]] that he only rides a Harley, or his chopper with friends, not a sport bike (like the one Winslow was on). He also claimed to have his license. Both statements have been proven false since the accident.

Roethlisberger was released from the hospital at 11:46 PM on June 14, 2006. The next day, he released a statement apologizing for concerning friends, family, all his fans, and the Steelers organization, and in which he also stated, "If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Big Ben speaks out on accident, says he'll start wearing a helmet|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=2006-06-15|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06166/698658-100.stm}}</ref>

On June 19, the Pittsburgh police announced that Roethlisberger would be cited for failure to wear a helmet and failure to operate in his license class. Wearing a helmet is optional in Pennsylvania only for operators who currently possess and have had a motorcycle license for at least two years. The driver of the car was cited for failure to yield the [[Traffic#Priority .28right of way.29|right of way]].<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/steelers/2006-06-19-roethlisberger-accident_x.htm?POE=SPOISVA "Steelers' Roethlisberger to be cited for lack of license, helmet"] USA Today</ref>

Roethlisberger gave his first television interview after the accident on July 13, with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]''. He said he was told by responding paramedics that he ruptured a major blood vessel in his mouth and was minutes away from dying. Despite the seriousness of the accident, his recovery went so well that he started the first three Steelers 2006 preseason games.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/ESPNSports/story?id=2191627&page=1 ABC News: EXCLUSIVE: Ben Roethlisberger Won't Become Helmet Advocate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Sexual assault allegations===
====Lake Tahoe====
On July 17, 2009, a civil suit was filed in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], [[Nevada]] District Court accusing Roethlisberger of sexually assaulting Andrea McNulty, 31, in June 2008 in his hotel room while he was in [[Lake Tahoe]] for a celebrity golf tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/07/21/ben-roethlisbergers-accuser/|title=Ben Roethlisberger's Acuser|last=TMZ|publisher=TMZ.com|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref> Roethlisberger is one of nine defendants listed in the docket report. McNulty could not obtain criminal charges to be filed against him due to lack of evidence, and thus no investigation was launched to obtain any possible physical evidence. Roethlisberger's attorney denied the claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/nfl/07/21/roethlisberger.ap/index.html|title=Roethlisberger listed as defendant in sexual assault lawsuit|last=Associated Press|publisher=cnnsi.com|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2009-07-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The Lake Tahoe suit seeks at least $440,000 in damages from the quarterback and also alleges hotel officials for Harrah's Lake Tahoe went to great lengths to cover up the incident. The woman is seeking $50,000 in damages from the Harrah's officials. According to the woman, she was working as an executive casino host in July 2008, when she said Roethlisberger struck up a friendly conversation at her desk during the golf tournament, the next night she said Roethlisberger telephoned her to tell her that the television sound system in his room wasn't working and asked her to look at it. The woman said she determined that the TV was functioning properly, but as she turned to leave he stood in front of the door and blocked her, then grabbed her and started to kiss her.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8116680b&template=without-video&confirm=true Steelers QB Roethlisberger cancels press conference amid civil lawsuit]</ref> According to the lawsuit, the woman obtained hospital treatment after the alleged attack.

On August 8, 2009, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' published details of an affidavit filed as part of a motion by two of the other defendants named in the suit to relocate the case from [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] to [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas County]]. In the affidavit, Angela Antonetti, McNulty's former co-worker, delivered a sworn statement that McNulty had bragged to her about having consensual sex with Roethlisberger. As part of the affidavit, Antonetti said she was "absolutely shocked" upon hearing of the case on the radio on July 21. Antonetti explained, "I knew that [her] lawsuit and false allegations would unfairly and unjustly hurt Mr. Roethlisberger".<ref name="Antonetti-Post-Gazette">{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09220/989640-66.stm#ixzz0Nq1oEgKL|title=Woman's affidavit supports Roethlisberger's denial of sexual assault|last=post-gazette|publisher=post-gazette.com|date=2009-08-08|accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref>

According to the affidavit, defendant Antonetti claimed that McNulty had revealed she was hoping she had gotten pregnant with a "little Roethlisberger". Antonetti also claimed that she had been asked to travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in August 2008 in an attempt to "run into" the quarterback. In response, Antonetti advised McNulty she "shouldn't try to chase Mr. Roethlisberger".<ref name="Antonetti-Post-Gazette"/>

====Milledgeville, Georgia====
On March 5, 2010, it was revealed that police in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were investigating Roethlisberger for an unrelated sexual assault inside the women's restroom of the Capital City nightclub. The accuser, a then-20-year-old student at nearby [[Georgia College & State University]], was seen at several establishments with Roethlisberger leading up to the incident, including posing for a photograph with him.<ref name=TMZphotograph>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/03/08/ben-roethlisberger-photographed-accuser-sexual-assault-police-georgia-capital-city/|title=Ben Roethlisberger Photographed with Accuser|work=TMZ|date=03-08-2010|accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref> Roethlisberger spoke with police the night of the incident and stated that he did have contact with the woman that was not "[[consummated]]" and afterward the accuser slipped and injured her head. 

Roethlisberger hired lawyer Ed Garland, who had previously defended [[Baltimore Ravens]] linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] in his murder trial. Head coach [[Mike Tomlin]] stated at the time that he was "highly concerned" for the franchise and Roethlisberger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/03/steelers-coach-mike-tomlin-im-highly-concerned-for-our-franchise-and-for-ben-roethlisberger-personally/1|title=Steelers coach Tomlin: 'I'm highly concerned for our franchise and for Ben'|work=USA Today|author=Davis, Nate|date=March 21, 2010|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

The accuser was treated at [[Oconee Regional Medical Center]]. An emergency-room doctor and two nurses examined her and noted in their report a "superficial laceration and bruising and slight bleeding in the genital area", but could not say if trauma or sexual assault was the cause. The remaining examination was "normal".<ref name=DAtranscript>{{cite web|url=http://nationalsportsreview.com/sports/us/d-wil/2010/04/12/da-fred-bright-transcript-plus-the-post-statement-interview/|title=D.A.

The doctor's report also quoted the alleged victim telling them that, "A boy kind of raped me."<ref name=DAtranscript/>

In interviews with the police on the night of the incident, the woman alleged that Roethlisberger, after inviting her and her friends to the V.I.P. area of the nightclub, encouraged them to do numerous shots of alcohol before one of his bodyguards<U+2014>an off-duty [[Coraopolis, Pennsylvania]]/"[[Pittsburgh International Airport]] interdiction" officer<ref name="Silver">{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghpostgazette.com/pg/10114/1053019-57.stm|title=Coraopolis probing officer's relationship to Roethlisberger|last=Silver|first=Jonathan D.|date=April 24, 2010|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref><U+2014>led her down a hallway to a stool and left. Roethlisberger allegedly approached and exposed himself and, despite the woman's protests, followed her into what turned out to be a bathroom when she tried to leave through the first door she saw. The woman claims Roethlisberger then had sex with her. It is further alleged that friends of the woman attempted to intervene out of worry, but the second of Roethlisberger's bodyguards<U+2014>an off-duty [[Pennsylvania State Police|Pennsylvania State Trooper]]<U+2014>avoided eye contact and said he did not know what they were talking about. The policemen later claimed to "have no memory" of meeting the woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2010/04/15/1387465/steelers-ready-to-punish-roethlisberger.html|title=Roethlisberger's accuser says she told him 'no'|work=Merced Sun-Star|author=Brumback, Kate|date=04-15-2010|accessdate=2010-04-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On April 12, 2010, district attorney Fred Bright held a press conference to announce that Roethlisberger would not be charged. Bright said "looking at all the evidence here, "I can not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt". "<ref name=DAtranscript/> Furthermore, the accuser wrote to the D.A. through her lawyer expressing she no longer wanted to pursue criminal charges<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/District-attorney-No-charges-for-Ben-Roethlisberger.html|title=District attorney: No charges for Ben Roethlisberger|work=National Football Post|author=Wilson, Aaron|date=04-12-2010|accessdate=04-12-2010}}</ref> because the level of media attention would make a criminal trial too "intrusive" of a personal experience. The letter stressed that she was not recanting her accusation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/04/full-text-of-letter-ben-roethlisbergers-accuser-sent-asking-da-not-to-prosecute/1?loc=interstitialskip|title=Full text of letter Ben Roethlisberger's accuser sent asking DA not to prosecute|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Leahy, Sean|date=04-12-2010|accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref>

As a result of the unabridged details revealed in Bright's press conference, reaction was swift. Steelers president [[Art Rooney II]] was reported to be "furious".<ref name=SIKing>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/peter_king/04/13/mail/?cnn=yes&hpt=Mid|title=MMQB Mail: Big Ben deserves at least two-game suspension in 2010|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|author=King, Peter|date=04-13-2010|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> The owner of Pittsburgh-based PLB Sports, which marketed "Big Ben's Beef Jerky", terminated the company's five-year sponsorship of Roethlisberger, the first such action in the company's 14 year history.<ref name=NoJerky>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/36469125|title=Food Maker Drops Roethlisberger|work=[[CNBC]]|author=Rovell, Darren|date=04-13-2010|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref name=PBJ>[http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/pittsburgh-company-cuts-ties-with-roethlisberger/ blogs.nytimes.com], ''Pittsburgh company cuts ties with Roethlisberger'' (retrieved 23 Apr 2010)</ref>

The Georgia incident has also garnered media attention for the potential discrepancies in player treatment based on race, as black players like [[Michael Vick]] and [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam "Pacman" Jones]] were disciplined harshly for their off-the-field conduct.<ref name=PPG>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10103/1049930-66.stm|title=Steelers or NFL must suspend Roethlisberger|work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|author=Cook, Ron|date=04-13-2010|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> Milledgeville Police Sergeant Jerry Blash, who had been photographed with Roethlisberger earlier in the evening, was the first officer to respond to the scene. He resigned on April 15, 2010, after apparently making a comment at the scene that "this bitch is drunk" in reference to the accuser.<ref name=OfficerResigns>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/04/15/ben-roethlisberger-sergeant-jerry-blash-officer-cop-quit-resign-milledgeville-police-rape-sexual-assault/|title=Cop in Roethlisberger Case - I Quit|work=TMZ|date=04-15-2010|accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref>

Roethlisberger was among the celebrities lampooned in the 14th season premiere of the [[Comedy Central]] animated series ''[[South Park]]'', appearing in a rehabilitation class for "sex addicts" along with [[David Letterman]], [[Bill Clinton]], and others. Titled "[[Sexual Healing (South Park)|Sexual Healing]]", the episode aired shortly after the second accusation of sexual assault was made.<ref>Owen, Rob.

===2010 suspension===

On April 21, 2010, the NFL's Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] announced that Roethlisberger would be suspended without pay for the first six games of the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]] due to a violation of the NFL's [[National Football League player conduct controversy|personal conduct policy]].  Roethlisberger was ordered to undergo a league-mandated "professional behavior evaluation" and "must adhere to any counseling or treatment that is recommended by the professional evaluators."<ref name="APBW">{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9F7J7Q81&show_article=1|title=Roethlisberger banned 6 games|last=Wilner|first=Barry|date=April 21, 2010|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> The suspension was subsequently reduced to four games.<ref>"[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5527564 Pittsburgh Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger suspension cut to 4 games]".
