'''Mercury''' is the innermost and smallest [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]],{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} [[orbit]]ing the [[Sun]] once every 87.969 Earth days. The orbit of Mercury has the highest [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of all the Solar System planets, and it has the smallest [[axial tilt]]. It completes three rotations about its axis for every two orbits. The [[Apsis|perihelion]] of Mercury's orbit [[Apsidal precession|precesses]] around the Sun at an excess of 43&nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] per century; a phenomenon that was explained in the 20th century by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General Theory of Relativity]].<ref name=wudka1998/> Mercury is bright when viewed from [[Earth]], ranging from <U+2212>2.3 to 5.7 in [[apparent magnitude]], but is not easily seen as its greatest [[Elongation (astronomy)|angular separation from the Sun]] is only 28.3<U+00B0>. Since Mercury is normally lost in the glare of the Sun, unless there is a [[solar eclipse]] it can be viewed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere only in morning or evening [[twilight]], while its extreme elongations occur in Declinations south of the celestial equator, such that it can be seen at favorable apparitions from moderate latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere in a fully dark sky.

Comparatively little is known about Mercury; ground-based telescopes reveal only an illuminated crescent with limited detail. The first of two [[spacecraft]] to visit the planet was [[Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]], which mapped about 45% of the planet<U+2019>s surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the [[MESSENGER|MESSENGER spacecraft]], which mapped a further 30% during its flyby of January 14, 2008. MESSENGER's last flyby took place in September 2009 and it is scheduled to attain orbit around Mercury in 2011, where it will begin mapping the rest of the planet.

Mercury is similar in appearance to the [[Moon]]: it is heavily [[impact crater|cratered]] with regions of smooth plains, has no [[natural satellite]]s and no substantial [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. However, unlike the Moon, it has a large [[iron]] [[planetary core|core]], which generates a [[magnetic field]] about 1% as strong as that of the [[Earth]].<ref name=russell_luhmann1997/> It is an exceptionally dense planet due to the large relative size of its core. Surface temperatures range from about 90 to {{nowrap|700 [[Kelvin|K]]}} (<U+2212>183&nbsp;<U+00B0>C to 427&nbsp;<U+00B0>C),<ref name="ESAs&t"/> with the [[subsolar point]] being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the [[Geographical pole|poles]] being the coldest.

[[#Ancient astronomers|Recorded observations]] of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects: one visible only at sunrise, which they called [[Apollo]]; the other visible only at sunset, which they called [[Hermes]].<ref name="Dunne">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 <U+2014> Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J.

==Internal structure==
Mercury is one of four [[terrestrial planet]]s in the [[Solar System]], and is a rocky body like the Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an [[equator]]ial [[radius]] of 2,439.7&nbsp;km.<ref name="nssdcMercury">{{cite web|title=Mercury Fact Sheet|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/mercuryfact.html|publisher=[[NASA]] Goddard Space Flight Center | date=November 30, 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> Mercury is even [[list of Solar System objects by radius|smaller]]&mdash;albeit more massive&mdash;than the [[List of moons by diameter|largest]] [[natural satellite]]s in the Solar System, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Mercury consists of approximately 70% [[metal]]lic and 30% [[silicate]] material.<ref name="strom" /> Mercury's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427&nbsp;g/cm<U+00B3>, only slightly less than Earth<U+2019>s density of 5.515&nbsp;g/cm<U+00B3>.<ref name="nssdcMercury" /> If the effect of [[gravitational compression]] were to be factored out, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser, with an uncompressed density of 5.3&nbsp;g/cm<U+00B3> versus Earth<U+2019>s 4.4&nbsp;g/cm<U+00B3>.<ref>{{cite web

Mercury<U+2019>s density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. While the Earth<U+2019>s high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the [[planetary core|core]], Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not nearly as strongly compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.<ref>{{cite journal

Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this. The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal-silicate ratio similar to common [[chondrite]] meteorites, thought to be typical of the Solar System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass.<ref name="Benz"/> However, early in the Solar System<U+2019>s history, Mercury may have been struck by a [[planetesimal]] of approximately 1/6 that mass and several hundred kilometers across.<ref name="Benz"/> The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle, leaving the core behind as a relatively major component.<ref name="Benz"/> A similar process, known as the [[giant impact hypothesis]], has been proposed to explain the formation of Earth<U+2019>s [[Moon]].<ref name="Benz"/>

Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the [[solar nebula]] before the Sun's [[energy]] output had stabilized. The planet would initially have had twice its present mass, but as the [[protostar|protosun]] contracted, temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2,500 and 3,500&nbsp;K (Celsius equivalents about 273 degrees less), and possibly even as high as 10,000&nbsp;K.<ref name="CameronAGW1">

===Impact basins and craters===
[[File:Caloris basin labeled.png|thumb|Mercury<U+2019>s [[Caloris Basin]] is one of the largest impact features in the Solar System.]]

[[Impact crater|Crater]]s on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped cavities to multi-ringed [[impact basin]]s hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of Mercury's stronger surface gravity.<ref name=Spudis01>{{cite journal

One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around the planet, converging at the basin<U+2019>s antipode (180 degrees away).

Overall, about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. A notable basin is the 400&nbsp;km wide, multi-ring [[Tolstoj Basin]] which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500&nbsp;km from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625&nbsp;km diameter rim.<ref name=Spudis01/> Like the [[Moon]], the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of [[space weathering]] processes, including [[Solar wind]] and [[micrometeorite]] impacts.<ref>{{cite journal

===Plains===
[[File:Mercury's 'Weird Terrain'.jpg|thumb|The so-called <U+201C>Weird Terrain<U+201D> was formed by the [[Caloris Basin]] impact at its antipodal point.]]
There are two geologically distinct plains regions on Mercury.<ref name=Spudis01/><ref name=WagWolIva01/> Gently rolling, hilly plains in the regions between craters are Mercury's oldest visible surfaces,<ref name=Spudis01/> predating the heavily cratered terrain. These inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> It is not clear whether they are of volcanic or impact origin.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire surface of the planet.

Smooth plains are widespread flat areas which fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. Unlike lunar maria, the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localisation and rounded, lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins.<ref name=Spudis01/> All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name=Spudis01/> The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of impact melt.<ref name=Spudis01/>

One unusual feature of the planet<U+2019>s surface is the numerous compression folds, or [[rupes]], which crisscross the plains. As the planet<U+2019>s interior cooled, it may have contracted and its surface began to deform, creating these features. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that the folds are more recent.<ref>{{cite journal

Mercury<U+2019>s magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the [[solar wind]] around the planet, creating a [[magnetosphere]]. The planet's magnetosphere, though small enough to fit within the Earth,<ref name="chaikin1" /> is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma. This contributes to the [[space weathering]] of the planet's surface.<ref name="qq" /> Observations taken by the {{nowrap|Mariner 10}} spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planet's nightside. Bursts of energetic particles were detected in the planet's magnetotail, which indicates a dynamic quality to the planet's magnetosphere.<ref name="chaikin1" />

During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER discovered that Mercury<U+2019>s magnetic field can be extremely "leaky." The spacecraft encountered magnetic "tornadoes" <U+2013> twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space <U+2013> that were up to {{nowrap|800 km}} wide or a third of the radius of the planet. These 'tornadoes' form when magnetic fields carried by the solar wind connect to Mercury's magnetic field. As the solar wind blows past Mercury's field, these joined magnetic fields are carried with it and twist up into vortex-like structures. These twisted magnetic flux tubes, technically known as [[flux transfer event]]s, form open windows in the planet's magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact Mercury's surface.<ref name="NASA060209"/>

The process of linking interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields, called [[magnetic reconnection]], is common throughout the cosmos. It occurs in Earth's magnetic field, where it generates magnetic tornadoes as well. However, the MESSENGER observations show the reconnection rate is ten times higher at Mercury. Mercury's proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER.<ref name="NASA060209">{{cite web

==Orbit and rotation==
[[File:ThePlanets Orbits Mercury PolarView.svg|thumb|Orbit of Mercury (yellow)]]

Mercury has the most [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit of all the planets; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million kilometers. It takes 88 days to complete an orbit.
The diagram on the right illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury<U+2019>s orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same [[semi-major axis]]. The higher velocity of the planet when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval. The size of the spheres, inversely proportional to their distance from the Sun, is used to illustrate the varying heliocentric distance. This varying distance to the Sun, combined with a 3:2 [[Mercury (planet)#Spin<U+2013>orbit resonance|spin-orbit resonance]] of the planet<U+2019>s rotation around its axis, result in complex variations of the surface temperature.<ref name=strom>{{cite book

Mercury<U+2019>s orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth<U+2019>s orbit (the [[ecliptic]]), as shown in the diagram on the right. As a result, [[Transit of Mercury|transit]]s of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between the Earth and the Sun.

At certain points on Mercury<U+2019>s surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun rise about halfway, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same [[Extraterrestrial skies#Mercury|Mercurian day]]. This is because approximately four days before [[perihelion]], Mercury<U+2019>s angular [[orbital velocity]] exactly equals its angular [[rotational velocity]] so that the Sun<U+2019>s [[improper motion|apparent motion]] ceases; at perihelion, Mercury<U+2019>s angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity. Thus, the Sun appears to move in a [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] direction. Four days after perihelion, the Sun<U+2019>s normal apparent motion resumes at these points.<ref name="strom" />

===Spin<U+2013>orbit resonance===
[[File:Mercury's orbital resonance.svg|thumb|After one orbit, Mercury has rotated 1.5 times, so after two complete orbits the same hemisphere is again illuminated.]]

For many years it was thought that Mercury was synchronously [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Sun, [[rotation|rotating]] once for each orbit and always keeping the same face directed towards the Sun, in the same way that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, [[radar]] observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin<U+2013>orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun; the eccentricity of Mercury<U+2019>s orbit makes this resonance stable<U+2014>at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest, the Sun is nearly still in Mercury<U+2019>s sky.<ref>{{cite journal

The original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked, was that whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, it was always nearly at the same point in its 3:2 resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because, coincidentally, Mercury's rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth. Due to Mercury<U+2019>s 3:2 spin<U+2013>orbit resonance, a [[solar day]] (the length between two [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] [[Astronomical transit|transit]]s of the Sun) lasts about 176 Earth days.<ref name="strom" /> A [[sidereal day]] (the period of rotation) lasts about 58.7 Earth days.<ref name="strom" />

Simulations indicate that the [[orbital eccentricity]] of Mercury varies [[chaos theory|chaotically]] from nearly zero (circular) to more than 0.45 over millions of years due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the other planets.<ref name="strom" /><ref name=Correia2009>{{cite journal

===Advance of perihelion===
{{Main|Perihelion precession of Mercury}}
In 1859, the French [[mathematician]] and astronomer [[Le Verrier|Urbain Le Verrier]] reported that the slow [[precession]] of Mercury<U+2019>s orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by [[Newtonian mechanics]] and perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or perhaps instead a series of smaller 'corpuscules') might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury, to account for this perturbation.<ref>U. Le Verrier (1859), (in French), [http://www.archive.org/stream/comptesrendusheb49acad#page/378/mode/2up "Lettre de M. Le Verrier <U+00E0> M.

(At p.383 in the same volume Le Verrier's report is followed by another, from Faye, enthusiastically recommending to astronomers to search for a previously undetected intra-mercurial object.)</ref> (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun.) The success of the search for [[Neptune]] based on its perturbations of the orbit of [[Uranus]] led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was even named [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]].

[[File:Mercury transit 1.jpg|thumb|[[Transit of Mercury]]. Mercury is the small dot in the lower center, in front of the Sun. The dark area on the left of the solar disk is a [[sunspot]].]]

The first [[Telescope|telescopic]] observations of Mercury were made by [[Galileo]] in the early 17th century. Although he observed [[planetary phase|phases]] when he looked at Venus, his telescope was not powerful enough to see the phases of Mercury. In 1631 [[Pierre Gassendi]] made the first telescopic observations of the [[Astronomical transit|transit]] of a planet across the Sun when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by [[Johannes Kepler]]. In 1639 [[Giovanni Battista Zupi|Giovanni Zupi]] used a telescope to discover that the planet had [[orbit]]al phases similar to Venus and the Moon. The observation demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited around the Sun.<ref name=strom/>

A very rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another ([[occultation]]), as seen from Earth.

===Research with space probes===
{{Main|Exploration of Mercury}}

Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, since the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over 91 million kilometers into the Sun<U+2019>s [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Mercury has an [[orbital speed]] of 48&nbsp;km/s, while Earth<U+2019>s orbital speed is 30&nbsp;km/s. Thus the spacecraft must make a large change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) to enter a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury, as compared to the delta-v required for other planetary missions.<ref name="DunneCh4">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 <U+2014> Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J. A. and Burgess, E.|chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/ch4.htm|publisher=NASA History Office|year=1978|chapter=Chapter Four|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref>

The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun<U+2019>s [[potential well]] becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-v change to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. To land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft would rely entirely on rocket motors. [[Aerobraking]] is ruled out because the planet has very little atmosphere. A trip to Mercury requires more rocket fuel than that required to [[escape velocity|escape]] the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes have visited the planet so far.<ref name="JPLprofile1">{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury&Display=OverviewLong|title=Mercury|publisher=[[NASA]] Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=May 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> A proposed alternative approach would use a [[solar sail]] to attain a Mercury-synchronous orbit around the Sun.<ref>{{ cite journal

The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was [[NASA]]<U+2019>s [[Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]] (1974<U+2013>75).<ref name="Dunne" /> The spacecraft used the gravity of [[Venus]] to adjust its orbital velocity so that it could approach Mercury, making it both the first spacecraft to use this [[Gravitational slingshot|gravitational <U+201C>slingshot<U+201D>]] effect and the first NASA mission to visit multiple planets.<ref name="DunneCh4" /> Mariner&nbsp;10 provided the first close-up images of Mercury<U+2019>s surface, which immediately showed its heavily cratered nature, and revealed many other types of geological features, such as the giant scarps which were later ascribed to the effect of the planet shrinking slightly as its iron core cools.<ref>{{cite web

On March 27, 1974, two days before its first flyby of Mercury, Mariner 10's instruments began registering large amounts of unexpected ultraviolet radiation near Mercury. This led to the tentative identification of [[Mercury's moon]]. Shortly afterward, the source of the excess UV was identified as the star 31 [[Crater (constellation)|Crater]]is, and Mercury's moon passed into astronomy's history books as a footnote.

The spacecraft made three close approaches to Mercury, the closest of which took it to within 327&nbsp;km of the surface.<ref name="AtlasM10">{{cite book|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/sp423.htm|title=Atlas of Mercury|publisher=[[NASA]] Office of Space Sciences|author=Merton E.

The data revealed that the planet<U+2019>s magnetic field is much like the Earth<U+2019>s, which deflects the [[solar wind]] around the planet. However, the origin of Mercury<U+2019>s magnetic field is still the subject of several competing theories.<ref name="Ness1">{{ cite journal | last = Ness| first = Norman F. | year = 1978| month = March|title=Mercury - Magnetic field and interior| journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 21| pages = 527<U+2013>553| bibcode = 1978SSRv...21..527N | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1978SSRv...21..527N| accessdate = 2008-05-23|doi=10.1007/BF00240907}}</ref>

[[File:MESSENGER Assembly.jpg|thumb|MESSENGER being prepared for launch]]

A second NASA mission to Mercury, named MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging), was launched on August 3, 2004, from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] aboard a [[Boeing Delta 2]] rocket. It made a fly-by of the Earth in August 2005, and of Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 to place it onto the correct trajectory to reach an orbit around Mercury.<ref>{{cite web|year=2005|url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=18956| title = MESSENGER Engine Burn Puts Spacecraft on Track for Venus|publisher = SpaceRef.com | accessdate = 2006-03-02}}</ref> A first fly-by of Mercury occurred on January 14, 2008, a second on October 6, 2008,<ref name="MessCountdown">{{cite web|url= http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=115|title= Countdown to MESSENGER's Closest Approach with Mercury|date= January 14, 2008 | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |accessdate= 2008-05-30}}</ref> and a third on September 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=MESSENGER Gains Critical Gravity Assist for Mercury Orbital Observations

<!--[[File:mercclose3.jpg|thumb|Mercury as imaged by the MESSENGER probe]]-->
The mission is designed to clear up six key issues: Mercury<U+2019>s high density, its geological history, the nature of its [[magnetic field]], the structure of its core, whether it has ice at its poles, and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from. To this end, the probe is carrying imaging devices which will gather much higher resolution images of much more of the planet than Mariner&nbsp;10, assorted [[spectrometer]]s to determine abundances of elements in the crust, and [[magnetometer]]s and devices to measure velocities of charged particles. Detailed measurements of tiny changes in the probe<U+2019>s velocity as it orbits will be used to infer details of the planet<U+2019>s interior structure.<ref name="MSGRgrayzeck" />

On [[map]]s of Mercury created by astronomers before the detailed mapping of recent decades, the ''Solitudo Hermae Trismegisti'' (''Wilderness of [[Hermes Trismegistus]]'') was identified as a major feature of the planet Mercury, covering about one-fourth of the planet in the SE quadrant.<ref name=sp423p15a/>

''Mercury, [[Mercury (mythology)|the Winged Messenger]]'', is a movement in [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''.
