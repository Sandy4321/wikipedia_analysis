'''Cobra-La''' is a fictional civilization created by Hasbro for the military-themed toyline and TV series [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]. Introduced to the public in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]'' and the 1987 series of action figures, Cobra-La was originally meant as a working name, but [[Hasbro]] liked the name so much that it remained.<ref>http://www.joeheadquarters.com/interviews_dixon.shtml</ref> Their background story borrows many themes from the story ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the name itself is likely a pun on [[Shangri-La]].

==Cobra-La hierarchy==
Cobra-La is ruled by a half-serpent called [[Golobulus]]. The winged [[Nemesis Enforcer]] carries out the will of [[Golobulus]] and is a fearsome warrior.  [[Pythona]] is Golobulus' personal messenger and assassin. She is rarely seen but known to be very deadly. There are also the [[Royal Guard (G.I. Joe)|Royal Guards]] that have the sole task of protecting Golobulus.

==Cobra-La biotechnology==
* '''Web of Remembrance''': This is a cloud like device in Cobra-La that the ruler manipulates into displaying records depicting the history of Cobra-La.

* '''Psychic Motivator''': A chirping spider-like device used to literally program humans. Doctor Mindbender was programmed with one containing all necessary information, the idea and the will to create [[Serpentor]] after [[Cobra Commander]] was proven to be repeatedly incompetent and had failed one time too many. Seen in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]''. 

* '''Spore Launcher''': A missile like device designed to launch a cylindrical, multistage rocket like device used to deploy "The Fungazoids"(See below)

* '''Spore Rocket''': A device launched by the Spore launcher. It is a multistage gas or air powered rocket which contains a payload of the fungazoids.

* '''Fungazoids''': These are spores created by Cobra-La designed to cause brain damage to such a degree that any human exposed to it would be reverted back to a very primitive animal-like level of intelligence. They are also mutagenic as well, since a small quantity turned [[Cobra Commander]] into a large snake. These were destroyed by the "BET" before they re-entered Earth's atmosphere.

* '''Worm Timer''': A worm that is on a rod that is marked, to function as a timing device. Shown being used by the Cobra-La ruler in regard to the fungazoid spores.

* '''Serpentor's Collar''': This is where Serpentor creates his "Snake spears" from which, if they miss, degenerate into [[cobra]]s which slither away. If they hit, the snake spear kills its victim. One exception was Duke who was hit by one, but survived (an earlier draft for the film would've had Duke killed, but was scrapped due to the negative reactions of [[Optimus Prime]]'s death in ''[[Transformers: The Movie]]''). He grabs the collar, which is a writhing mass of snakes, two at the time, rips one out, straightens the snake into a spear and throws it, head first at an enemy.

* '''Path of Esteem''': Stored in a large, flat, golden receptacle, The Path of Esteem serves the same role as a red carpet. When the golden chest is placed on the ground, a large number of red crab like creatures exit, forming a red path for the esteemed to walk upon.

* '''Hand Weapons''': Cobra-La citizens, Pythona in particular, use several unnamed weapons, including a starfish like creature which is thrown at targets and then constricts it's tentacles.  Another is a small, formless, green object that, when squeezed, emits some sort of knockout gas, a creature the appears to be an actual starfish that is thrown like a shuriken, and a creature that looks to be four snakes joined in a cross shape at their center, which is immune or highly resistant to electricity and is capable of chewing through metals. Pythona used a clamshell that generated thin strips that wrapped around opponents. Pythona attacked several Joes in Recon Sleds with trilobite looking creatures that exploded, wrecking the Joe vehicles. The Cobra-La royal guards are shown to use a single weapon; a large golden scimitar, which is highly curved on one edge, and serrated on another. Cobra-La also has a small, hand held plant that emits a white mist which is capable of causing temporary blindness.

* '''Carnal Tree''': These large plants grow beneath the Cobra-La ice dome, in various parts of the city, particularly around the entrance and the detention area. The trees use long green vines to ensnare would be escapees or intruders.

==Comics==
===''G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers''===
Cobra-La made their first comics appearance in the ''G.I Joe vs. the Transformers'' series from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], holders of the G.I Joe license. First appearing in the second crossover springing Cobra scientist [[Doctor Mindbender]] from jail, they would reappear in the fourth crossover 'Black Horizon', with a much-expanded backstory.

Although the series does not directly reveal their origins, it does reveal the reason for their secrecy. Believed to be the children of an old god by early humans, the creatures found themselves confronted by another creature believed to be a god; [[Unicron]], the Chaos-Bringer, had come to Earth to devour it to feed his own hunger. Cobra-La opposed him, threatening to attack him with a metal-devouring organic spore. Before the two sides could annihilate each other, an agreement was reached favouring both parties. The creatures would go into hiding, allowing humanity to develop. Then, when they had reached a sufficient technological level to serve as slaves for the Chaos-Bringer's inner workings, the creatures would call Unicron. He would destroy the remainder of humanity and Cobra-La would inherit the human-free world he left behind. Thousands of years later the pact would be kept and the creatures, now calling themselves Cobra-La, would summon Unicron via a beacon, using [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] and his team of Decepticon mercenaries to kill all interlopers, including Autobots from Cybertron. They also have an unusual captive - [[General Joseph Colton (G.I. Joe)|Joe Colton]], the original G.I Joe. Here they are also led by [[Golobulus]]. They attempted to sacrifice [[Firewall (G.I. Joe)|Firewall]] to Unicron, but were stopped by an escaped Colton, [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] and [[Optimus Prime]]. Colton battled Nemesis Enforcer while Hawk freed Firewall. Golobulus attempted to stop him, but was crushed by Prime. Pythona had a change of heart and killed the Enforcer. With Unicron defeated by [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]], Cobra-La were detained by the rest of G.I Joe.

==Cartoons==
===''G.I. Joe: The Movie''===
Little is known of the history of Cobra-La in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]'' save for the fact that they dominated much of the Earth in the years before the [[Ice Age]]. Their way of life is based on a symbiotic relationship with nature: living creatures comprise their machines, vehicles, clothes and more, particularly massive [[mutant]] insectoids and serpents, from which they are descended. The weakness inherent in this technology, however, soon became apparent when the Ice Age began and destroyed much of what Cobra-La had built. Retreating into a massive cavern beneath the Himalayas with the intent of emerging to retake the world when the Ice Age had passed, the Cobra-Lavians were shocked to discover that the primitive barbarians that they had left on the surface managed to survive and flourish, evolving in body and mind and developing inorganic technology, the complete antithesis of Cobra-La.

In order to retake the Earth, Cobra-La's ruler, [[Golobulus]], chose a nobleman who had been scarred in a laboratory accident (which gave him additional eyes) to go forth from Cobra-La into the human world. This nobleman's mission was to raise an army that would conquer the world, paving the way for the return of Cobra-La. That army was [[Cobra Command|Cobra]], and the nobleman became known as [[Cobra Commander]]. After Cobra Commander's repeated failures in this task, Golobulus set into motion a plan to replace him. Using a "psychic motivator" to implant information into the brain of Cobra's top scientist [[Doctor Mindbender]], Golobulus had the unwitting scientist genetically engineer the perfect warrior from DNA samples of history's greatest rulers. This creation, [[Serpentor]], proceeded to take control of Cobra from Cobra Commander. Cobra-La guards then captured Cobra Commander, Serpentor, and any Cobra members with them and took them to their hidden headquarters. Golobulus held a trial of Cobra Commander for his repeated failures and put Serpentor in his place as a leader of the serpent world to come. Following his capture, Cobra Commander becomes a test subject for the spores which were to be spread around the Earth in order to de-evolve humanity back "to the level of mindless beasts" (as described by [[Pythona]] to [[Serpentor]]). Following a large-scale battle between the forces of G.I. Joe versus Cobra and Cobra-La forces, Cobra-La is in ruins and their plan is eventually foiled. Pythona and Nemesis Enforcer were thrown into a chasm, but Golobulus escapes.
