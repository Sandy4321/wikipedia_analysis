'''John Collins Covell''' (December 19, 1823 <U+2013> June 4, 1887) was a 19th-century [[American people|American]] [[educator]] and [[Superintendent (education)|school administrator]] specializing in [[deaf education]] in the U.S. states of [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]].

Covell was born in 1823 in [[Rhode Island]] and was the son of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[The Reverend|Reverend]] Joseph S. Covell, and the grandson of [[List of Governors of Rhode Island|Rhode Island Governor]] [[John Collins (Continental Congress)|John Collins]]. Covell attended [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] and graduated from the institution in 1847. Covell was recommended as a candidate for [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut]] and received the orders of a [[deacon]].

Covell accepted a [[teacher|teaching]] position in the Deaf Department of the [[Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind]] and relocated there in 1847. Covell was made a [[vice-principal]] of the institution and given charge of the entire Deaf Mute Department in 1852. During the [[American Civil War]], Covell entered the [[Confederate States Army]] with the [[military rank|rank]] of [[Major (United States)|major]] and served on the [[Staff (military)|staff]] of [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Brigadier general|Brigadier General]] [[Henry A. Wise]]. Covell served on General Wise's staff only briefly before returning to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind to serve as its [[Head teacher|principal]] in 1862, a position in which he served until 1872. In 1874, Covell was selected to serve as the principal of the [[West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind]]. Under his leadership, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind experienced "unprecedented success" and its [[student body]] began to grow due to Covell's initiatives. Covell served as the institution's principal until his death in 1887.

Covell was an active and prominent member of the [[Episcopal Diocese of West Virginia]] and was appointed the first [[churchwarden]] of Saint Stephen's Episcopal Church in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]]. Covell played an instrumental role in the construction of the church through his donation of property for the building site and financial contribution of the majority of its construction costs.

Following his death, Covell was honored in 1888 at the National Conference of Superintendents and Principals of Institutions for Deaf Mutes in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]] by W. O. Connor, Principal of the [[Georgia School for the Deaf]], who stated: "we greatly deplore [Covell's] loss to the Institution over which he presided with such universal acceptability; and that in his death we recognize the loss of a friend worthy of the fullest confidence, and an official of marked ability and adaptation to his duties, which he always performed with a faithfulness and efficiency unexcelled."<ref name = "NCSPIDM2">{{Harvnb|National Conference of Superintendents and Principals of Institutions for Deaf Mutes|1888|pp=220<U+2013>221.}}</ref> His [[obituary]] in ''[[Churchman (journal)|The Churchman]]'' remarked of Covell: "with untiring zeal and fidelity, he has labored in the noble work of elevating and educating the deaf, dumb and the blind.
