The term '''Japanese war crimes''' refers to events which occurred during the period of [[Japanese expansionism|Japanese imperialism]] from the late [[19th century|19th]] to mid-[[20th century|20th centuries]]. Other names, such as "'''Asian Holocaust'''", are sometimes used for many of these crimes and/or alleged crimes. Many of these events are subject to controversy among historians and/or people of different nationalities.

Historians and the governments of many countries officially hold the military of the [[Empire of Japan]], namely the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], responsible for the deaths and/or [[forced labour]] of many millions of civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) during the early 20th century.

Many [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prisoners of war were [[summary execution|summarily executed]] by Japanese forces during the [[Pacific War]].]]
There are differences from one country to another regarding the definition of Japanese war crimes.

===Japanese definitions=== 
Although the [[Geneva Convention]]s have, from [[1864]] onwards, provided the standard definitions of war crimes, Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions until after [[World War II]]. However, many of the alleged crimes committed by Japanese imperial personnel were also violations of the Japanese code of [[military law]], which the military either wilfully ignored, or failed to enforce.

In [[Japan]], the term "Japanese war crimes" generally refers to cases tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as the '''Tokyo Trials''', following the end of the [[Pacific War]]. The tribunal did not prosecute war crimes allegations involving mid-ranking officers or more junior personnel. Those were dealt with separately in other cities throughout the Asia-Pacific region.  

====Japanese government position====
The Japanese government takes the position that as Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, it violated no international law. For the same reason, the Japanese government also takes the view that Allied forces did not violate the Geneva Convention in acts committed against Japanese personnel and civilians.

The Japanese government did sign the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] in [[1929]], thereby rendering its actions in 1937-45 liable to charges of [[crimes against peace]], a charge which was introduced at the Tokyo Trials to prosecute '''Class-A War Criminals'''. (Class-B War Criminals are those found guilty of war crimes ''per se'', and Class-C War Criminals are those guilty of [[crimes against humanity]].) However, any convictions for such crimes are not recognised by the Japanese government, as the Kellogg-Briand Pact did not have any enforcement clause stipulating penalties in the event of violation.

The Japanese government accepted the terms set by the [[Potsdam Declaration]] (1945) after the end of the war. The declaration alluded, in Article 10, to two kinds of war crime: one was the violation of international laws, such as the abuse of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs); the other was obstructing "[[democracy|democratic]] tendencies among the Japanese people", and [[civil liberties]] within Japan.

Japanese law does not recognise those convicted in the Tokyo Trials and other trials as criminals, despite the fact that Japan governments have accepted the judgments made in the trials, in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] (1952). This is because the treaty does not mention the legal validity of the tribunal.  In the Japanese text, the word used for "accept" is ''judaku'' (which may also be translated as "to receive"), as opposed to the stronger ''shounin'' ("to certify").  Therefore the position of the Japanese government is that it accepts the judgment and sentences set by the trials as demands, but it does not accept the legal validity of the tribunal. This means, among other things that those convicted have had no ability, under Japanese law, to appeal, as the Tokyo Tribunal and other war crimes courts have no standing in Japanese law. Under normal circumstances it violates a number of fundamental principles of modern legal procedure to punish someone whose crime and penalty were defined only after the fact. Had Japan certified the legal validity of the war crimes tribunals in the San Francisco Treaty, this might have resulted in Japanese courts reversing such verdicts. Any such outcomes would have created domestic political crises and would have been unacceptable in international diplomatic circles.

The current Japanese jurists' consensus regarding the legal standing of the Tokyo tribunal is that, as a condition of ending the war, the  Allies demanded a number of conditions including the execution and/or incarceration of those whom they deemed to be responsible for the war. These people were defined as guilty by a tribunal organized by the Allies. The Japanese government accepted these demands in the Potsdam Declaration and then accepted the actual sentencing in the San Francisco Treaty, which officially ended the state of war between Japan and the Allies. Although the penalties for the convicted, including execution, can be regarded as a violation of their technical legal rights, the constitution allowed such violations if proper legal procedure was followed, in the general public interest. Therefore, any such execution and/or incarceration is constitutionally valid, but has no relationship to Japanese criminal law. Hence those convicted as war criminals are not defined as criminals in Japan, although their execution and incarceration is regarded as legally valid.

===International definitions===
[[Image:Nanjing1937 self-organized burial team.jpeg|thumb|226px|right|[[China|Chinese]] civilians burying some of the victims of the [[Nanjing Massacre]], carried out by the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] military in [[1937]]-[[1938|38]]. Some estimates maintain that 8.4 million Chinese civilians were killed by Japanese forces during 1937-45.]]
[[War crimes]] may be broadly defined as unconscionable behavior by a government or military personnel against either enemy civilians or enemy combatants. Military personnel from the [[Empire of Japan]] have been accused and/or convicted of committing many such acts during the period of [[Japanese expansionism|Japanese imperialism]] from the late [[19th century|19th]] to mid-[[20th century|20th centuries]]. They have been accused of conducting a series of [[human rights abuse]]s against [[civilian]]s and [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) throughout [[east Asia]] and the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] region. These events reached their height during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of [[1937]]&ndash;[[1945|45]] and the [[Pacific War|Asian and Pacific campaigns of World War II]] ([[1941]]-45).

Different societies use widely different timeframes in defining Japanese war crimes. For example, the annexation of [[Korea]] by [[Japan]] in [[1910]] was followed by the widespread use of violence and deprivation of civil liberties against the Korean people.  Millions of Koreans may have been killed during the occupation.  Thus, some Koreans refer to "Japanese war crimes" as events occurring during a period from 1910 to 1945. By comparison, the [[United States]] did not come into military conflict with Japan until 1941, and thus Americans may consider "Japanese war crimes" as encompassing only those events that occurred from 1941 to 1945.{{fact}}

A complicating factor is that a small minority of people in every Asian and Pacific country conquered by Japan collaborated with the Japanese military, or even served in it, for a wide variety of reasons, such as economic hardship, coercion, or antipathy to other [[imperialist]] powers. The [[Indian National Army]] is perhaps the best-known example of a movement opposed to [[Europe]]an imperialism which served as part of the Japanese military. Prominent individual nationalists in other countries, such as the later [[Indonesia]]n president, [[Suharto]], also served with Japanese forces. In some cases such non-Japanese personnel were also responsible for war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan. For political reasons, many of these people were never investigated or tried and brought to justice after 1945. In South Korea especially, it is alleged that such people were often able to acquire wealth by serving Japan. It is further alleged in South Korea that some former collaborators have covered up "Japanese" war crimes in order to avoid their own prosecution and/or exposure.

The issue of Japan's ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereignty]] over countries such as [[Taiwan]] and Korea, prior to 1945, is a matter of controversy. Japanese control was accepted and recognised internationally, and was justified by instruments such as the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] ([[1895]], which included China's ceding of Taiwan) and the [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty]] ([[1910]]). It has been argued that acts committed against people subject to Japanese sovereignty cannot be considered "war crimes". However, the native populations were not consulted on the changes in sovereignty, nor was there universal acceptance of such annexations. There was ongoing resistance to Japanese rule and &mdash; in any case &mdash; war crimes may also be committed during [[civil war]]s. (See [[History of Taiwan#Japanese Rule|Japanese rule in Taiwan]] and [[Korea under Japanese rule]] for further details.){{fact}}

==Background==  
===Japanese military culture and imperialism===
Military culture, especially during [[Japanese expansionism|Japan's imperialist phase]] had great bearing on the conduct of the Japanese military before and during [[World War II]].

Seven centuries of ''[[bushido]]'' (the [[militarism|militaristic]] [[samurai]] warrior code) taught unquestioning obedience to the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], and fearlessness in battle. During the so-called "Age of Empire" in the late [[19th century]], Japan followed the lead of other world powers in aggressively seeking an overseas empire.

As in other imperial powers, Japanese popular culture is said to have become increasingly [[racist]], or at least [[ethnocentric]], at around this time. The rise of [[Japanese nationalism]] was seen partly in the adoption of [[Shinto]] as a [[state religion]] from [[1890]], including its entrenchment in the education system. Shinto held the [[Emperor]] to be divine because he was deemed to be a descendant of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]]. This provided justification for the requirement that the emperor and his representatives to be obeyed without question. In addition, many Japanese believed that Japan was a special place created by gods, rather than part of the ordinary world, and that the Japanese people had a divine mission to expand their culture, including by the conquest of other countries. This was similar to other contemporaneous philosophies and ideologies, such as the U.S. "[[Manifest Destiny]]", or the European idea of ''[[la mission civilatrice]]'' ("the civilising mission"), that supported the imperialism of other countries. 

Japan's victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894-95) signified Japan's rise to the status of a world power.

From the point of view of bushido, POWs taken by Japanese forces were not worthy of treatment as soldiers. Compassion for defeated enemies was considered a sign of weakness. Some Japanese personnel considered the execution of prisoners as honourable, since it released the POWs from the dishonour of surrender. Perhaps as a consequence, Japan was not a signatory to the [[Geneva Convention]] &mdash; which stipulates the humane treatment of POWs &mdash; until after World War II. Nevertheless, the treatment of prisoners by the Japanese military in earlier wars, such as the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-05), had been at least as humane as that of other militaries.

===The events of the 1930s and 1940s===
By the late [[1930s]], the practices of Japan's [[military dictatorship]] created at least superficial similarities between the wider Japanese military culture and that of [[Nazi Germany]]'s elite military personnel, such as those in the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''. Japan also had a military [[secret police]] force, known as the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', which resembled the Nazi ''[[Gestapo]]'' in its role in annexed and occupied countries. 

As in other dictatorships, irrational brutality, hatred and fear became commonplace. Perceived failure, or insufficient devotion to the Emperor would attract punishment, frequently of the physical kind. In the military, officers would assault and beat men under their command, who would pass the beating on to lower ranks, all the way down. In POW camps, this meant prisoners received the worst beatings of all.

The traditional severity of bushido, and the ethnocentrism of Japan's modern imperial phase, often coalesced into brutality towards civilians and POWs. After the launching of a full-scale military campaign against China in 1937, instances of murder, torture and rape committed by Japanese soldiers seemed to be overlooked by their commanding officers, and generally went unpunished. Such acts were repeated throughout the Pacific War.

==War crimes==
===Mass killings===
Because of the sheer number of deaths caused by the Japanese military during the 1930s and 1940s, the killings are often compared to the contemporaneous suffering imposed by [[Nazi Germany]] during 1933&ndash;45. The historian [[Chalmers Johnson]] has written that:

:''It may be pointless to try to establish which World War Two [[Axis powers|Axis]] aggressor, Germany or Japan, was the more brutal to the peoples it victimised. The Germans killed six million [[Jews]] and 20 million Russians [i.e. [[Soviet Union|Soviet citizens]]]; the Japanese slaughtered as many as 30 million [[Philippines|Filipinos]], [[Malaya|Malays]], [[Vietnam]]ese, [[Cambodia]]ns, [[Indonesia]]ns and [[Burma|Burmese]], at least 23 million of them [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]]. Both nations looted the countries they conquered on a monumental scale, though Japan plundered more, over a longer period, than the Nazis. Both conquerors enslaved millions and exploited them as [[forced labour]]ers &mdash; and, in the case of the Japanese, as [forced] [[sexual slavery|prostitute]]s for front-line troops. If you were a Nazi prisoner of war from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[United States|America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] or [[Canada]] (but not Russia) you faced a 4 % chance of not surviving the war; [by comparison] the death rate for Allied POWs held by the Japanese was nearly 30 %.''[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/john04_.html]

[[R. J. Rummel]], a political scientist at the [[University of Hawaii]], states that between 1937 and 1945, the Japanese military "murdered between three million and 10 million people."[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP3.HTM]

In [[China]] alone, during 1937&ndash;45, there are said to have been 8.4 million "non-military casualties", not including civilians killed accidentally during battle. (See [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)#Chinese Casualties|Chinese Casualties in the Sino-Japanese War]].) The most infamous incident during this period was the [[Nanjing Massacre]] of [[1937]]-38, when, according to the findings of the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], the Japanese Army massacred more than 100,000 civilians.{{fact}}

===Preventable famine===
Deaths caused by the diversion of resources to the Japanese military in occupied countries are also regarded as war crimes by many people. Millions of civilians in [[southern Asia]] &mdash; especially [[Vietnam]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesia), both of which were major [[rice]]-growing countries &mdash; died during a preventable [[famine]] in [[1944]]&ndash;45. (See, for example, the article on the  [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]].){{fact}}

===The treatment of prisoners of war===  	 
The Japanese military's use of [[forced labour]], by Asian civilians and POWs also caused many deaths &mdash; more than 100,000 in the case of the [[Burma Railway]] alone. The Geneva Convention exempted POWs of [[sergeant]] rank or higher from manual labour, and stipulated that prisoners performing work should be provided with extra rations and other essentials. During World War II such rules were largely respected in German POW camps, except in the case of Soviet POWs. However, Japan was not a signatory at the time, and Japanese forces did not follow the convention.{{fact}}

===Experiments on human beings===
Special military units conducted physiological experiments on civilians and POWs. One of the most infamous units was [[Unit 731]]. Victims were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, amputations, and were used to test biological weapons, among other experiments.

:''To determine the treatment of frostbite, prisoners were taken outside in freezing weather and left with exposed arms, periodically drenched with water until frozen solid. The arm was later amputated; the doctor would repeat the process on the victim<U+2019>s upper arm to the shoulder. After both arms were gone, the doctors moved on to the legs until only a head and torso remained. The victim was then used for plague and pathogens experiments.'' [http://etd-submit.etsu.edu/etd/theses/available/etd-0403105-134542/unrestricted/ByrdG042805f.pdf]

===Comfort women===
{{main|Comfort Women}}
Women from all over Asia and the Pacific were forced to work as prostitutes, known as "Comfort Women", during the 15 Years War (1931-45). There is a shortage of reliable primary documentation of this aspect of Japanese war crimes, because the women involved were often illiterate and/or ashamed to share their experiences, or were not willing to do so until many years later.{{fact}}<!--Source that says it was a war crime-->

===Looting===
Many historians state that violence by Japanese personnel was closely tied to [[loot]]ing. For example, [[Sterling Seagrave|Sterling]] and [[Peggy Seagrave]], in a [[2003]] book on "[[Yamashita's gold]]" &mdash; secret repositories of loot from across [[Southeast Asia]], in the [[Philippines]] &mdash; argued that the theft was organised on a massive scale, either by ''[[yakuza]]'' [[gangster]]s such as [[Yoshio Kodama]], or by officials at the behest of [[Emperor Hirohito]], who wanted to ensure that as many of the proceeds as possible went to the government. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/john04_.html] The Seagraves allege that Hirohito appointed his brother, [[Prince Chichibu]], to head a secret organisation called ''[[Kin no yuri]]'' (Golden Lily) for this purpose.

==Post-1945 reactions==
===The Tokyo Trials===
{{main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}
The Tokyo Trials, which were conducted by the [[Allied powers]], found many people guilty of such crimes, including three (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]]s: [[Koki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]], and [[Kuniaki Koiso]]. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as [[Class-A war criminal]]s later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.

* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir<U+014D> Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].

* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]].

However, these two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.

===Other trials===
Besides the Tokyo Trials, other prosecutions of Japanese personnel for war crimes were also held in many other cities throughout Asia and the Pacific, during [[1946]]&ndash;[[1951|51]]. Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials. The [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], China, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and [[The Philippines]]. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death. The largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Battle of Ambon#The Laha massacre|Laha massacre]] (1942).

===Official apologies===
The Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and [[List of war apology statements issued by Japan|numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government]].  For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, stated that Japan "through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations", and he expressed his "feelings of deep remorse" and stated his "heartfelt apology".

However, the official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate by many of the survivors of such crimes and/or the families of dead victims. The subject of official apologies is controversial as many people aggrieved by alleged Japanese war crimes maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts and/or that the Japanese government has merely expressed "regret" or "remorse".[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html]. However, according to Oxford Dictionary, an apology is "a formal, public statement of regret", and moreover, the Japanese word for "apology" itself has also been used on several occasions.

There is a counter-claim that the media in some countries plays down or never mentions Japanese government statements on war crimes. It is also alleged that in countries where media outlets are under formal or [[de facto]] state control, many people especially young are unaware of Japanese government statements which include the word "apology".  It is further alleged that this reflects anti-Japanese feeling. Some people in Japan, especially the political right, assert that what is being demanded is that the Japanese Prime Minister and/or the Emperor perform ''[[dogeza]]'', in which an individual kneels and bows his head to the ground, the highest form of apology in [[east Asia]]n societies. This would be widely viewed as humiliating to Japan as a whole, but would parallel, for example, [[German Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]], who [[Warschauer Kniefall|knelt at a monument to the Jewish victims of the Warsaw Ghetto]], in [[1970]]. However, no German Chancellor has ever performed such an act in regard to non-Jewish civilians, or Allied military personnel who were victims of Nazi war crimes.

===Compensation===
There is a widespread perception that the Japanese government has not accepted the legal responsibility for compensation and, as a direct consequence of this denial, it has failed to compensate the individual victims of Japanese atrocities. This, at least in a technical sense, is not true.

In particular, a number of prominent [[human rights]] and [[women's rights]] organisations still insist that Japan has a moral and/or legal responsibility to compensate individual victims, especially the [[sex slave]]s conscripted by the Japanese military in occupied countries and known as [[comfort women]]. 

The Japanese government officially accepted the requirement for monetary compensation to victims of war crimes, as specified by the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. The details of this compensation have been left to bilateral treaties with individual countries, except [[North Korea]], because Japan recognises [[South Korea]] as the sole legitimate government of the [[Korea|Korean peninsula]]. In the case of POWs from the [[western Allies]], compensation was paid to the victims through the [[Red Cross]]. The total amount Japan paid was [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]4,500,000. However, in a number of Asian countries, claims for compensation were either: abandoned for political reasons, or; paid by Japan, under the specific understanding that it would be used for individual compensation, but was not paid out to the victims by the governments concerned. Therefore a majority of individual victims in Asia received no compensation.

Therefore, the Japanese government's position is that the proper avenues for further claims are the governments of the respective claimants. As a result, every individual compensation claim brought to Japanese court has failed. Such was the case in regard to a British POW who was unsuccessful in an attempt to sue the Japanese government for additional money for compensation. As a result, the UK Government later paid additional compensation to all British POWs. There were complaints in Japan that the international media simply stated that the former POW was demanding compensation, and failed to clarify that he was seeking ''further'' compensation, in addition to that paid previously by the Japanese government.

A small number of claims have also been brought in US courts, and these have also been rejected.

During the treaty negotiation with South Korea, the Japanese government proposed that it pay monetary compensation to individual Korean victims, in line with the payments to western POWs. The Korean government instead insisted that Japan pay money collectively to the Korean government, and that is what occurred.  The South Korean government then used the funds for economic development.  The content of the negotiations was not released by the Korean government until 2004, although it was public knowledge in Japan.

Those on the right of Japanese politics insist that, because the governments of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]] abandoned their claims for monetary compensation, then the moral and/or legal responsibility for compensation belongs with these governments. The Japanese critics also point out that even though these governments abandoned their claims, they signed treaties that recognised the transfer of Japanese colonial assets to the respective governments. Therefore, to claim that these governments received no compensation from Japan is incorrect, and they could have compensated individual victims from the proceeds of such transfers.

The Japanese government, while admitting no legal responsibility for the so-called "comfort women", set up the [[Asian Women's Fund]] in [[1995]], which gives money to people who claim to have been forced into prostitution during the war. Though the organisation was established by the government, legally, it has been created such that it is an independent charity.  The activities of the fund have been controversial among both right- and left-wing elements in Japan, as well as international organisations supporting the women concerned.[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3680/is_200307/ai_n9253436]
One side argues that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while the other argues that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments.

====Intermediate compensation====
The term "intermediate compensation" (or intermediary compensation) was applied to the removal and reallocation of Japanese industrial (particularly military-industrial) assets to Allied countries. It was conducted under the supervision of [[Occupied Japan|Allied occupation forces]]. This reallocation was referred to as "intermediate" because it did not amount to a final settlement by means of bilateral treaties, which settled all existing issues of compensation. By 1950, the assets reallocated amounted to 43,918 items of machinery, valued at [[Yen|<U+00A5>]]165,158,839 (in 1950 prices). The proportions in which the assets were distributed were: China, 54.1%; the Netherlands, 11.5%; the Philippines 19% , and; the United Kingdom, 15.4%.

====Compensation under the San Francisco Treaty====
{{main|Treaty of San Francisco}}
=====Compensation from Japanese overseas assets=====
Japanese overseas assets refers to all assets owned by the Japanese government, firms, organisation and private citizens, in colonised or occupied countries. In accordance with Clause 14 of the San Francisco Treaty, Allied forces confiscated all Japanese overseas assets, except those in China, which were dealt with under Clause 21. It is considered that Korea was also entitled to the rights provided by Clause 21.  

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

=====Compensation to Allied POWs=====
Clause 16 of the San Francisco Treaty stated that Japan would transfer its assets and those of its citzens in countries which were at war with any of the Allied Powers or which were neutral, or equivalents, to the Red Cross, which would sell them and distribute the funds to former prisoners of war and their families. Accordingly, the Japanese government and private citizens paid out <U+00A3>4,500,000 to the Red Cross.

=====Allied territories occupied by Japan=====
Clause 14 of the treaty stated that Japan would enter into negotiations with Allied powers whose territories were occupied by Japan and suffered damage by Japanese forces, with a view to Japan compensating those countries for the damage.

Accordingly, the Philippines and South Vietnam received compensation in 1956 and 1959 respectively.  Burma and Indonesia were not original signatories, but they later signed bilateral treaties in accordance with clause 14 of the San Francisco Treaty.

===Debate in Japan===
There is a widespread perception, outside Japan, that there is a reluctance inside Japan to discuss such events and/or admit that they were war crimes. However, the controversial events of the Japanese imperial era are openly debated in the media, with the various political parties and ideological groups taking quite different positions. What differentiates Japan from Germany and Austria is that in Japan, there is no restriction to the freedom of speech in regard to this matter, while in Germany, Austria and some other European countries, [[Holocaust denial]] is a criminal offence.

Until the [[1970s]], such debates were considered a fringe topic in the media. In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tends to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of "[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]],'' a major [[liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanking Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The [[1990s]] are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, the accuracy of school history textbooks, and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.

As the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many right wing elements in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|"Martyrs of Sh<U+014D>wa"|<U+662D><U+548C><U+6B89><U+96E3><U+8005>|Sh<U+014D>wa Junnansha}}, Sh<U+014D>wa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia. However, the peace groups and the left also generally consider the bombing of Japanese civilians by the Allies, particularly the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], to be unjust and/or a violation of the international law. The left is also accused of being soft on Soviet atrocities.

By the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both "new right" and "new left".  This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident (they generally do not use the word "massacre"), were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally-defined duty.

The new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.

However, under the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military. 

Similarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal and/or moral case.

The new right/new left also takes a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a tributary of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was better than the previous regime in terms of human rights and economic development.

They also argue that, the ''[[Kantogun|Kant<U+014D>gun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant<U+014D>gun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932.  Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant<U+014D>gun'' invaded China proper, under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. However, the Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the Nanking Massacre were also promoted.) Therefore, claims that the government was held hostage by soldiers on the field hold little weight.

Whether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left.  Though both sides agree that constitutionally, he was exempt from any legal responsibility, some insist that he was ultimately responsible both politically and morally. They cite the fact that, after the war, the Emperor consulted Prime Minister [[Shigeru Yoshida]] regarding his possible abdication, a course of action that Yoshida advised against. Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consenses reached by the high command. Accordingly, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals.

===Controversial reinterpretations outside Japan===
Some activists outside Japan, are also attempting controversial reinterpretations of Japanese imperialism. For example, the views of a [[South Korea]]n ex-miliraty officer and right wing commentator, Ji Man-Won, have caused controversy in Korea and further abroad. Ji has praised Japan for "[[modernisation|modernising]]" Korea, and has said of women forced to become sex slaves: "most of the old women claiming to be former [[comfort women]], or sex slaves to the Japanese military during World War II, are fakes." In Korea, such views are widely regarded as being offensive, [[libel]]lous of the women concerned, and as representing [[Historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]] but are born out of political tensions within nations such as Korea and China between democractic and establishmentary movements in which the use of Japanese history, or contrived Japanese hate, if a useful tool for both sides.

===Later investigations===
As with investigations of Nazi war criminals, official investigations and enquiries are still ongoing. During the [[1990s]], the [[South Korea]]n government started investigating some individuals who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military. In South Korea, it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the [[Cold War]], many such individuals and/or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence and to assist in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves.

Non-government bodies and individuals have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in [[2005]], a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the [[1895]] [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min), the last Empress of [[Korea]]. The assassination was conducted by the [[Dark Ocean Society]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the individuals.
