'''Zapopan''' ({{IPA-es|sa<U+02C8>popan}}) is a city and [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] located in the Mexican state of [[Jalisco]], which is part of the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area]]. It is best known as being the home of the Virgin of Zapopan, an image of the Virgin Mary which was made in the 16th century. This image has been credited with a number of miracles and has been recognized by popes and even visited by [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name="encmuc">{{Cite web|url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/jalisco/mpios/14120a.htm |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M<U+00E9>xico Estado de Jalsico  Zapopan |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=January 19, 2010}}</ref>  The municipality is also the home of the Centro Cultural Universitario, which contains one of the most important concert venues in [[Latin America]]<ref name="breve">{{cite web |url= http://www.zapopan.gob.mx/ |title= Breve historia del municipio de Zapopan |publisher=Municipality of Zapopan |location=Zapopan, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Brief history of the municipality of Zapopan |accessdate=January 19, 2010 }}</ref>  and is the home of the new stadium for the [[C.D.

The name Zapopan comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word <U+201C>tzapotl<U+201D> which means among [[sapote]] trees and the word <U+201C>pan<U+201D> which means among under.<ref name="encmuc"/> It also has  the nickname of  <U+201C>Villa Exmaicera<U+201D>(Ex-corn village) as it used to be a major producer of corn.<ref name="breve"/>  Its seal was designed by Jos<U+00E9> Trinidad Laris in 1941 for the 400th anniversary of the city<U+2019>s founding.<ref name="encmuc"/>

==History==
[[File:Arcos zapopan.jpg|thumb|Entrance arch]]
From 1160 to 1325 a large number of [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] families migrated into this area from the south, with many settling in the Profundo Arroyo area. These first settlers eventually mixed among themselves and with newcomers such as [[Aztec]]s and eventually were known as Tecos. Many small shrines called <U+201C>cues<U+201D> were built here, mostly to worship the sun, although the primary deity was a god-child called Teopiltzintli or the corn god.<ref name="encmuc"/>

By the time the Spanish arrived Tzapopan was a fairly large settlement, but it was in decline due to wars with various surrounding nomadic tribes.  It was subject to the dominion of Atemajac, also called Tlatoanazgo, which itself was subject to the Hueytlatoanazgo of Tonal<U+00E1>.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1530, this area was subdued by [[Nu<U+00F1>o de Guzm<U+00E1>n]], but the establishment of a Spanish settlement of Zapopan did not happen until 1541 due to the [[Mixt<U+00F3>n War]]. In that year Francisco de Bobadilla, [[encomendero]] of Tlatltenango moved 130 Indians from his lands to repopulate Zapopan.  Accompanying them was an image of Our Lady of the Conception, which had traveled to areas like [[Zacatecas]] as part of evangelization efforts. This statue would eventually take on the name of Our Lady of Zapopan. The sanctuary for this image was begun in 1689.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1824, Zapopan was named at the seat of one of the 26 department of the newly created state of Jalisco. When the departments were reorganized in 1837, it retained its status as seat. In 1873, General Ramon Corona fought against rebel forces led by Manuel Lozada <U+201C>El Tigre de Alica<U+201D> at Rancho de la Mojonera.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1991, the town gained city status in a ceremony that took place on 8 December, the 450th anniversary of the city<U+2019>s foundation.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1979, Pope John Paul II visited the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

==The city==

===Basilica of Zapopan and Virgin of Zapopan===
[[File:Basilica de Zapopan atrio.jpg|thumb|275px|Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan.]]
{{cat main|Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan}}
The Virgin of Zapopan is an image of Our Lady of the Conception which was made in Michoac<U+00E1>n by native artisans in the early 16th century.<ref name="breve"/>  The statue is 34&nbsp;cm tall and made with corn stalks (''ca<U+00F1>a de maiz''), except for her hands which are made of wood. It was donated for evangelization efforts by Antonio de Segova, and carried to Zapopan by Miguel de Bolonia, who had the image tied to his body. Legend credits it with bringing an end to the Mixt<U+00F3>n War in the 16th century as well as relief from epidemics that plagued Guadalajara in the 17th century, a <U+201C>miracle<U+201D> that was affirmed by the bishop of the area. It was named the <U+201C>General<U+201D> (La Generela) of the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] in 1821, with the military title ratified in 1852 and 1894 by elements of the federal  and state governments.  It is still called by this alternate name. In 1919, it was crowned Queen of Jalisco by the Pope Benedict XV.<ref name="breve"/><ref name="senorades">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1849-Nuestra-Se%F1ora-de-Zapopan,-Jalisco |title= Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Zapopan, Jalisco |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=Our Lady of Zapopan, Jalisco |accessdate=January 19, 2010 }}</ref>

[[File:VirginofZapopan.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Main altar with the Virgin]]
Construction of the Basilica of Zapopan began in 1689.<ref name="encmuc"/> and finished in 1892.<ref name="hacer">{{cite web |url= http://www.zapopan.gob.mx/ |title= Cosas por hacer |publisher=Municipality of Zapopan |location=Zapopan, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Things to do |accessdate=January 19, 2010 }}</ref>  It has been modified and expanded since then. In front of the structure is a large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. The atrium contains bronze statues of Antonio de Segovia, who donated the image of the Virgin in the 16th century and one of Pope John Paul II, with a child dressed as a [[charro]], who represents Jalisco.<ref name="encmuc"/> The facade is [[Plateresque]]<ref name="hacer"/> and the entrances have [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and coats of arms. The main altar is made of marble from [[Carrara]] and [[Cyprus]] with the image of the Virgin of Zapopan in a glass case at the top. Another important sculpture is that of the Holy Family, which has been in the church since 1832. It was sculpted by Victoriano Acu<U+00F1>a.

In 1940 Pope Pius XII made the church a [[basilica]].

Part of the basilica building is dedicated to the Huichol Museum. The museum is dedicated to the art and culture of the [[Huichol people]] as well as some displays from the [[Tepehu<U+00E1>n]] and [[Cora people|Cora]] peoples.<ref name="encmuc"/> Another section of the basilica houses the Museum of the Virgin of Zapopan, where offerings left for the image can be seen, as well as items that have been used for its worship over the centuries.<ref name="hacer"/>

Annually, a large procession in this image<U+2019>s honor takes place on the 12th of October, [[Columbus Day]] (called <U+201C>D<U+00ED>a de la Raza<U+201D> (Day of the Race) in Spanish) .<ref name="encmuc"/> This tradition started in 1734, when this image was named the patron of Guadalajara and the protector against epidemics, storms and other calamities.<ref name="hacer"/> Starting at 6 am, the image is carried on the streets from the [[Guadalajara Cathedral]] to the Basilica of Zapopan.<ref name="encmuc"/> The streets, including the wide avenue of Manuel Avila Camacho in Zapopan proper, are packed with dancers, vendors selling traditional food and crafts and spectators.<ref name="senorades"/><ref name="hacer"/>  The image stops periodically to receive homage from the many traditional dance groups and [[mariachi]] bands along the way. Traditional dances include <U+201C>Los Tastoanes,<U+201D> <U+201C>La Danza del <U+00C1>guila Real,<U+201D> <U+201C>la de La Conquista<U+201D> and <U+201C>Los Huehuenches.<U+201D><ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="senorades"/> Once returned to its home at the Basilica, celebrations continue and end with fireworks at night.<ref name="encmuc"/>

About three-quarters of the municipality<U+2019>s land is used for agriculture and livestock. About fifteen percent is forested and the remaining is dedicated to the city of Zapopan.<ref name="breve"/>  The principle crops are corn, [[sorghum]], [[squash (plant)|squash]], tomatoes, [[chickpea]]s, [[avocado]]s, [[mango]]s and plums. Some livestock such as cattle, pigs and domestic fowl are raised. Agriculture employs less than three percent of the population. About a third of the population is employed in industry and manufacturing. Major companies that have facilities here include [[Kodak]], [[Motorola]] and Coca Cola. The rest of the population is involved in commerce and services.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Tourism is mostly focused on the Basilica of Zapopan and other local churches; however, outside the city there are a number of natural attractions such as '''Ixcat<U+00E1>n Geysers''' and the La '''Cola de Caballo''' waterfall.<ref name="encmuc"/> At the Santa Lucia dam one can fish and go out on rowboats. Cola de Caballo is a 150 meter tall waterfall which is part of the Blanco Arroyo. The Geysers of Ixcatan are geothermic zone with a number of geysers which jump out with a temperature of 45C up to five meters high. At Cerro del Diente are large rocks where mountain climbing, rock climbing and rappelling are practiced.The Barranca del R<U+00ED>o Santiago, also known as the Barranca del Oblatos is a canyon which 3.5&nbsp;km wide, 700 meters deep and 200&nbsp;km long. The Bosque de la Primavera (Primavera Forest) covers 30,500 hectares over the Sierra de la Primavera. The forest area has both fresh water and thermal springs and varied plant and wildlife. There are a number of signaled hiking trails with signs pointing out interesting points and plants. Another forest in the municipality is the Bosque El Centinela, which is an area that was reforested in the late 1970s and has mountain biking paths and campgrounds.<ref name="hacer"/> A number of water parks such as Rio Caliente and La Primavera have been established.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The municipality has three main archeological sites. '''Ixt<U+00E9>pete''' contains a Teotihuacan style pyramid which is twenty meters long, sixteen meters wide and 1.83 meters high. Construction phases of this pyramid date back from the 5th century to the 10th century.  '''El Grillo''' is located in the Tabachines housing subdivision in the north of the Valley of Atemajac. This site has a series of fourteen tombs arranged along an arroyo which is now dry. '''La Coronilla''' is located in an area called La Experiencia.<ref name="encmuc"/> In and around the city of Zapopan, there have been finding of ancient tombs. One example is when about a dozen pre-Hispanic objects were found during a hydraulic work excavation at Ciudad Granja, in Zapopan, Jalisco. A pot, a vase and anthropomorphic figures are among the items discovered. These objects are of the [[shaft tomb|Shaft Tombs]] Tradition which developed between 100 BCE and 500 CE in western Mexico. Further excavations are planned to search for a shaft tomb. The initial discovery was made by construction workers in May 2009 while doing maintenance work.<ref name="foundobjects">{{cite web |url= http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3202&Itemid=512 |title= Prehispanic Objects Found in Zapopan |publisher=INAH |location=Mexico |accessdate=January 19, 2010 }}</ref>
