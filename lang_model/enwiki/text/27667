[[Capital punishment]] is legal in the [[U.S.]] [[Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]]. In what is now the Commonwealth of Virginia, the first execution in the future United States was carried out in 1608. It was the first of 1,371 executions, the highest total of any state in the Union. For a full list of those executed since 1976 see the [[list of individuals executed in Virginia]].

==History==
Hanging was the predominant method for executions before 1909. Other methods had been used during this time <U+2014> three people convicted of [[pirate|piracy]] in 1700 were [[gibbet]]ed, four pirates were hanged in chains in 1720, and a female slave was burned in 1737. From 1909 until 1994, the [[electric chair]] was used for all but one execution (that of [[Joel Payne]] on April 9, 1909). On February 2, 1951, four [[African American]]s were executed for rape in one case and another was executed for murder in an unrelated case<U+2014>the most executions held on a single day in Virginia.   On February 5, 1951, the remaining three defendants in the rape case were executed.  The youngest person to have been executed in Virginia was [[Percy Ellis (criminal)|Percy Ellis]], who at the age of 16 was electrocuted on March 15, 1916.  Only one woman, [[Virginia Christian]], has been put to death by the state since it took over executions from the counties.  She was put to death in 1912 for the murder of her boss.

==Post-''Gregg''==
After the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld Georgia's "guided discretion" laws in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', Virginia's laws were modified along the same lines. The first person executed after being sentenced to death under these laws was [[Frank Coppola]] on August 10, 1982. He was the first of 100 individuals executed by the state, the second highest total post-''Gregg'' behind Texas.

The electric chair continued to be solely used until 1994, when legislation was enacted giving inmates the choice of [[lethal injection]] or the electric chair, with lethal injection the default method if no choice was made. Five inmates have since opted for the Virginia [[electric chair]]; the most recent was [[Larry "Bill" Elliott]] on November 17, 2009. Gov. [[Timothy M. Kaine]] has also stated that he opposes the option of the electric chair, but he has not moved to drop it as an option. 

Executions are carried out at [[Greensville Correctional Center]] in [[Jarratt, Virginia]], and death row is located at the Sussex State Prison near [[Waverly, Virginia]]. State law specifies that at least six citizens who are not employees of the Department of Corrections must be present to serve as witnesses to the execution. Since Governor [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] signed an executive order on the matter in 1994, relatives of the homicide victim(s) in the case have the right to witness the execution. Relatives of the condemned inmate are barred from being present.

A legal precedent in the United States was created after the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', {{ussc|536|304|2002}}. It ruled that executing the mentally retarded violates the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]'s ban on [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s. Daryl Atkins had been involved in a murder and robbery. He was "mildly [[Mental retardation|mentally retarded]]" and had an [[IQ]] of 59. The ruling did stay the executions of several people on death row. Atkins was later judged to have an IQ of over 70 and remains on death row in Virginia.

==Public opinion==
A 2001 poll of Virginians found that 69.5% supported the use of the death penalty, with 25.2% opposed. The same poll found that if given the option of [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of parole, support for the death penalty dropped to 45.2%, with 50% supporting life without parole.
