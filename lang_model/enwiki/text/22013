'''Elena Vyacheslavovna Dementieva''' (pronounced: YELL-e-nuh de-MENT-ye-vuh [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{Audio|Elena_dementieva.ogg|<U+0415><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0412><U+044F><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0414><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+044C><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430>}}); born [[October 15]], [[1981]], [[Moscow]]), better known as '''Elena Dementieva''', is a professional tennis player from [[Russia]].

==Tennis career==

Dementieva played and won her first international tournament, [[Les Petit As]], in [[France]] at the age of 13. In [[1997]], she entered the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] top 500. She turned professional in [[1998]] and entered the top 100 in [[1999]]. 

In 1999, Dementieva represented [[Russia]] in the [[Fed Cup]] final against the [[United States]], scoring Russia's only point when she upset [[Venus Williams]] 1-6, 6-3, 7-6(5), recovering from a 4-1 third set defecit.  She played her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] main draws, qualifying for the [[Australian Open]], [[French Open]], and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and receiving a direct entry into the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]].  She reached the second round at the Australian Open and French Open, made a first round exit at Wimbledon, and reached the third round of the U.S. Open.

In [[2000]], she entered the top 20 by winning more than 40 singles matches for the second straight year and earned more than U.S. $600,000. She became the first woman from Russia to reach the U.S. Open semifinals, where she lost to [[Lindsay Davenport]]. At the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], Dementieva won the silver medal, losing to Venus Williams in the gold medal match 6-2, 6-4.  In 2000, Dementieva was named the WTA tour's Most Improved Player. 

[[2001]] was the second straight year in which Dementieva finished in the WTA's top 20. During the year, she became the top ranked Russian player, a position previously held by [[Anna Kournikova]] since December [[1997]].  Dementieva, however, suffered a shoulder injury in Australia. To keep playing matches, she altered her serve, adding slice and changing her motion. After her shoulder healed, her service motion stayed the same, and many consider it the worst serve among the top players. She has double faulted as many as 19 times in a match and hit 50 mph first and second serves. Where the ball toss should be in the "1 o'clock position" (if a clock was placed above the server's head, the ball should be tossed where 1 o'clock was) she was tossing them at 2 o'clock.

In [[2002]], Dementieva and her partner [[Janette Husarova]] of [[Slovakia]] reached the final of the U.S. Open and won the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]]. In singles, Dementieva defeated a top ranked player for the first time, beating world No. 1 [[Martina Hingis]] 6-2, 6-2 in a quarterfinal in Moscow.  Dementieva reached the final of that tournament, losing to [[Jelena Dokic]].

In [[2003]], Dementieva played the most tournaments among top ten players (27) and won approximately U.S. $900,000 in prize money. At [[Amelia Island]], she won her first WTA tour title, defeating [[Amanda Coetzer]], [[Daniela Hantuchov<U+00E1>]], [[Justine Henin-Hardenne]], and second ranked Davenport.  Dementieva was the lowest seed (10th) to win the tournament in its 24-year history. She also won back-to-back titles in [[Bali]] and [[Shanghai]], defeating [[Chanda Rubin]] in the final in both events. Dementieva finished 2003 in the top 10 for the first time (No. 8). In addition, she reached the semifinals of the Wimbledon doubles with her friend and compatriot [[Lina Krasnoroutskaya]], beating the Venus and Serena Williams team along the way.

Dementieva's breakthrough year was [[2004]]. In [[Miami]], she defeated Venus Williams in the quarterfinals and [[Nadia Petrova]] in the semifinals. Dementieva then lost to the top seeded and two-time defending champion [[Serena Williams]] 6-1, 6-1. On [[April 5]], she reached her highest singles ranking at sixth in the world. With fifth ranked [[Anastasia Myskina]] and ninth ranked Petrova, it was the first time that three Russians appeared in the WTA top 10 simultaneously. In May at the French Open, Dementieva reached her first Grand Slam final, defeating former top ranked Davenport in the fourth round, Mauresmo in the quarterfinals, and [[Paola Suarez]] in the semifinals, all in straight sets. Dementieva lost to compatriot Myskina in the first all-Russian Grand Slam final.  (The last female Russian Grand Slam finalist was Dementieva's coach at the time, [[Olga Morozova]], at [[1974]]'s French Open and Wimbledon.) Later that year at the U.S. Open, after a first round loss at Wimbledon to [[Sandra Kleinova]], Dementieva reached her second Grand Slam final, defeating [[Am<U+00E9>lie Mauresmo]] and [[Jennifer Capriati]] en route. Countrywoman [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] defeated Dementieva in straight sets in the final, becoming the third consecutive Russian Grand Slam winner. Following the U.S. Open, Dementieva won her first title in [[Hasselt]] and reached the Moscow finals for the second time, losing to Myskina.

In [[2005]], Dementieva reached six semifinals, the most important being at the U.S. Open.  She also reached the final in Charleston, losing to Henin Hardenne, and Philadelphia, losing to Mauresmo despite serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set. In the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, Dementieva defeated top ranked Davenport 6-1, 3-6, 7-6(6) for her second victory over a current No. 1 player. In the semifinals, she lost to [[Mary Pierce]] 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. The momentum of the match with Pierce changed in Pierce's favor when, with Dementieva up a set, Pierce received 12 minutes of on-court medical treatment. Partnering [[Flavia Pennetta]] of Italy, Dementieva reached her second doubles final at the U.S. Open 

Following the U.S. Open, Dementieva helped [[Russia]] repeat as Fed Cup champions, beating [[France]] 3-2 in the final. All three points came from Dementieva, as she avenged her loss to Pierce at the U.S. Open, beat [[Am<U+00E9>lie Mauresmo]], and then won the deciding doubles match with partner [[Dinara Safina]].  At the WTA Tour Championships, Dementieva lost all three round robin matches against Mauresmo, Pierce, and Clijsters with the same score each time: 6-2, 6-3.

Dementieva started slowly in [[2006]].  After losing to [[Kim Clijsters]] in an exhibition in Hong Kong, she lost in the first round of the Australian Open to [[Julia Schruff]]. But immediately following that tournament, Dementieva won her first Tier I event, the [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]]. On the run to the title, she defeated [[Katarina Srebotnik]], [[Nicole Vaidisova]], and [[Anastasia Myskina]], all in three sets. She then defeated the resurgent Hingis, with Hingis saying after the match, "If she played like that all the time, she'd win Grand Slams."

At the [[Pacific Life Open]], despite double faulting 79 times in six matches, Dementieva reached the final.  She defeated rising stars [[Sania Mirza]], [[Ana Ivanovi<U+0107>]], and [[Na Li]] along the way.  Dementieva then upset Henin Hardenne in a semifinal 2-6, 7-5, 7-5. The victory was her fourth three set match of the tournament, and fatigue contributed to her 6-1, 6-2 loss to [[Maria Sharapova]] in the final. The conditions were also windy that day, and her flat, counter-punching strokes had less margin for error than those of Sharapova.

After the Pacific Life Open, Dementieva lost in the fourth round in Miami to [[Tatiana Golovin]].  Dementieva's subsequent clay court results were largely mediocre. Dementieva lost in the Warsaw semifinals to [[Kim Clijsters]], Berlin third round to Hingis for the first time in four matches, and the Rome quarterfinals to [[Dinara Safina]]. Dementieva then lost in the third round of the French Open to [[Shahar Peer]] 6-4, 7-5 after being up 4-1 in both sets. On grass, Dementieva reached the s'Hertogenbosch semifinals, losing to [[Michaella Krajicek]] despite holding a match point, and the Wimbledon quarterfinals. At Wimbledon, Dementieva beat Mirza, [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], [[Elena Likhovtseva]], and [[Shenay Perry]] before losing to fourth seeded Sharapova 6-1, 6-4. Despite the loss, Dementieva was applauded by many fans and critics for her improvement in her serve. She no longer tossed the ball so far to the side and hit the slice serve every time. Because of this, she was able to hit first serves up to 110 mph, which was generally where top players of the game were consistently hitting. However, her second serve was still vulnerable to the akward motion, as they usually were about half the speed of her first serve.

Dementieva was Russia's top player for the 2006 Fed Cup World Group I playoff against Croatia, winning both her single matches in straight sets.  

<!-- [[Image:Dementieva_wins_JP_Morgan_Chase_Open.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dementieva celebrates her victory at the 2006 JP Morgan Chase Open.]] -->

In August 2006, Dementieva won the JP Morgan Chase Open in Los Angeles by defeating [[Jelena Jankovi<U+0107>]] in the final 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. En route to her sixth career title, she defeated everyone who had beaten (or, in the case of the U.S. Open, would beat) her at the 2006 Grand Slam tournaments&mdash;Schruff in the second round, Peer in the third round, Sharapova in a semifinal (for the first time since 2003), and Jankovi<U+0107> in the final.

At the 2006 U.S. Open, Dementieva reached the quarterfinals for the fourth time, losing to Jankovi<U+0107> 6-2, 6-1. The three games she won were all breaks of serve. Dementieva did not hold serve during the entire match. Dementieva remarked afterwards, "Yeah, it is disappointing, you know. I'm getting older, and I haven't won a Grand Slam, so that's really what I'm thinking about all the time. I feel like I was in a good shape here. That's why it's sad." [http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/interviews/2006-09-05/200609051157491850390.html]. She lost the distinction of being the Russian player to have won the most prize money to Maria Sharapova, who won the tournament. 

In the second round of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Dementieva overcame cramps and a 6-4, 4-1 deficit to defeat Srebotnik 4-6, 7-5, 7-5. When serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set, Dementieva collapsed and needed treatment. Dementieva failed to serve out the match but broke Srebotnik again and finished the match on her second opportunity. But due to the injury sustained from her second round match, Dementieva withdrew from the tournament.

At her home tournament in Moscow, Dementieva reached her seventh semifinal of 2006, losing to [[Anna Chakvetadze]], after defeating Peer (and saving a match point) in the second round and [[Patty Schnyder]] in the quarterfinals for the first time this year.

Dementieva qualified for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships for the seventh straight time, the only active player to do so. She lost to all three players in her round robin group: Sharapova 6-1, 6-4; Kuznetsova 7-5, 6-3; and Clijsters 6-4, 6-0.  Her career win-loss record at this tournament fell to 3-14. She had lost her last 9 matches played there.

Dementieva started 2007 by playing an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, the Watson Waters Challenge, where she defeated [[Nicole Vaidisova]] in the quarterfinals and lost to Sharapova in the semifinals. Her first official tournament was in [[Sydney, Australia]], where she lost in the second round to [[Li Na]] 3-6, 6-1, 7-5 after being up 5-2 in the third set and holding five match points.

At the [[2007 Australian Open]], Dementieva matched her career best result at this tournament by reaching the fourth round, where she lost to Vaidisova 6-3, 6-3. It was interesting to note that to win the Australian Open, players generally had to cope with long matches because of a neutral surface and extreme heat. Generally, players who were most fit had the best success Down Under. The exception to that was Dementieva, who is considered to be the most fit player in women's tennis today. She has been referred to as "the backboard" in 3rd sets, as she seems to play like she just started a match.

Dementieva unsuccessfully attempted to defend her singles title at the [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]] in [[Tokyo]], losing a semifinal match to Hingis 6-4, 6-3. Because of an injury she could not participate in the [[Open Gaz de France]] tournament in Paris. Without having fully recovered she played again at Antwerp but had to retire from her first round match against [[Elena Likhovtseva]]. She then travelled to [[Indian Wells]] to compete in the [[Pacific Life Open]] but withdrew from the tournament at short notice. According to her website [http://eng.dementieva.ru/] she will take a timeout until the end of April. As a result of this on April 2 she dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since September 2003.
