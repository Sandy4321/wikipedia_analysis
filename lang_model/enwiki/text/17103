{{Main|History of Sydney}}
===Indigenous history prior to 1788===
Radiocarbon dating suggests that the Sydney region has been inhabited by [[indigenous Australians]] for at least 30,000 years.<ref>{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Macey | coauthors= | title=Settlers' history rewritten: go back 30,000 years | date=2007-09-15| publisher= | url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/settlers-history-rewritten/2007/09/14/1189276983698.html | work =The Sydney Morning Herald | pages =| accessdate =2007-09-15 | language = }}</ref> The traditional Indigenous inhabitants of Sydney Cove are the [[Cadigal]] people, whose land once stretched from south of Port Jackson to Petersham.<ref>City of Sydney.

The British called the Indigenous people the "[[Eora]]",<ref name="kohen">Kohen, J. L. 2000. First and last peoples: Aboriginal Sydney. In J. Connell (Ed.).

[http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/theme1.htm City of Sydney Indigenous History of Sydney Cove]</ref> There were three language groups in the Sydney region, which were divided into dialects spoken by smaller clans. The principal languages were [[Darug language|Darug]] (the ''[[Cadigal]]'', original inhabitants of the City of Sydney, spoke a coastal dialect of Darug), [[Dharawal language|Dharawal]] and [[Guringai language|Guringai]]. Each clan had a territory, the location of that territory determined the resources available. Although [[urbanization]] has destroyed much evidence of these settlements (such as shell [[midden]]s), a number of [[Sydney rock engravings]], carvings and [[rock art]] remain visible in the [[Hawkesbury sandstone]] of the Sydney basin.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bruce | last=Elder | title=History set in stone | date=2007-09-07 | publisher=The Age| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/new-south-wales/history-set-in-stone/2007/09/05/1188783292366.html | accessdate =2007-10-18}}</ref>

===The early colony===
In 1770, British sea captain Lieutenant [[James Cook]] landed in [[Botany Bay]] on the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]]. It is here that James Cook made first contact with an Aboriginal community known as the [[Gweagal]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Once were warriors | work = Fairfax Media | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2002-11-11 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308574533.html | accessdate = 2008-12-21 }}</ref>. Under instruction from the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, a [[Penal colony|convict settlement]] was founded by [[Arthur Phillip]], who arrived at [[File:Sydney looking north over Hyde Park 1828.jpg|thumb|left|Sydney circa 1828, looking north over [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] towards the [[Port Jackson|harbour]]]] [[Botany Bay]] with a fleet of 11 ships on 18 January 1788. This site was soon determined to be unsuitable for habitation, owing to poor soil and a lack of reliable fresh water. Phillip subsequently founded the colony further up the coast, at [[Sydney Cove]] on [[Port Jackson]] on 26 January 1788. He named it after the British [[Home Secretary]], [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Thomas Townshend, Lord Sydney]], in recognition of Sydney's role in issuing the charter authorising Phillip to establish a colony. The original name was intended to be ''Albion'' until Phillip decided upon ''Sydney''.<ref>{{cite web | title = The 10 people Who Shaped Sydney | work = Fairfax Media | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | url = http://blogs.smh.com.au/urbanjungle/2008/11/the_10_people_w.html | accessdate = 2008-12-21 }}</ref> In April 1789 a disease, thought to be [[smallpox]], killed an estimated 500 to 1000 Aboriginal people between [[Broken Bay]] and [[Botany Bay]].<ref name="kohen"/> There was violent resistance to British settlement, notably by the warrior [[Pemulwuy]] in the area around Botany Bay, and conflicts were common in the area surrounding the [[Hawkesbury River]]. By 1820 there were only a few hundred Aborigines and [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] had begun initiatives to 'civilize, Christianize and educate' the Aborigines by removing them from their clans.<ref name="kohen" />

Macquarie's tenure as [[Governor of New South Wales]] was a period when Sydney was improved from its basic beginnings. Roads, bridges, wharves and public buildings were constructed by British and Irish [[Convictism in Australia|convicts]], and by 1822 the town had banks, markets, well-established thoroughfares and an organised constabulary. The 1830s and 1840s were periods of urban development, including the development of the first suburbs, as the town grew rapidly when ships began arriving from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain and Ireland]] with [[immigrants]] looking to start a new life in a new country. On 20 July 1842 the municipal council of Sydney was incorporated and the town was declared the first city in Australia, with John Hosking the first elected mayor.<ref> ''Australian Encyclopaedia'' Volume 2, p 524, [[Angus & Robertson|Angus and Robertson]] Limited, 1926 </ref> The first of several [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] started in 1851, and the port of Sydney has since seen many waves of people arriving from around the world. Rapid suburban development began in the last quarter of the 19th century with the advent of steam powered tramways and railways. With [[Industrial revolution|industrialisation]] Sydney expanded rapidly, and by the early 20th century it had a population well in excess of one million. The [[Great Depression]] hit Sydney badly. One of the highlights of the Depression era, however, was the completion of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932.<ref>{{cite web

===Topography===
Sydney's urban area is in a coastal basin, which is bordered by the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the East, the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] to the West, the [[Hawkesbury River]] to the North and the [[Royal National Park]] to the South. It lies on a [[submergent coastline]], where the [[ocean]] level has risen to flood deep river valleys ([[ria]]) carved in the hawkesbury sandstone. [[Port Jackson]], better known as Sydney Harbour, is one such ria and is the largest natural harbour in the world.<ref>{{cite web | last = Latta | first = David | title = Showcase Destinations Sydney, Australia: The Harbour City | work = Meeting Professionals International | publisher = The Meeting Professional | date = January 2006 | url = http://www.mpiweb.org/CMS/mpiweb/mpicontent.aspx?id=3918 | accessdate = 2008-12-21 }}</ref> The Sydney area is not affected by significant earthquakes.

Geographically, Sydney lies over two regions: the [[Cumberland Plain]], a relatively flat region lying to the south and west of the harbour, and the [[Hornsby Plateau]], a sandstone plateau lying mainly to the north of the harbour and dissected by steep valleys. The parts of the city with the oldest European development are located in the flat areas south of the harbour. The [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]] was slower to develop because of its hilly topography and lack of access across the harbour. The [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] was opened in 1932 and linked the North Shore to the rest of the city.

The city is not affected by [[tropical cyclone|cyclones]]. The [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]] Southern Oscillation plays an important role in determining Sydney's weather patterns: drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other, associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation. Many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires, notably in 1994 and [[Black Christmas (bushfires)|2001<U+2013>02]]&nbsp;<U+2014> these tend to occur during the spring and summer. The city is also prone to severe hail storms and wind storms. One such storm was the [[1999 Sydney hailstorm|1999 hailstorm]], which severely damaged Sydney's eastern and city suburbs. The storm produced massive hailstones of at least {{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and resulting in insurance losses of around [[Australian dollar|AUD]] $1.7 billion in less than five hours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/nsw/sevwx/14april1999.shtml | title = The Sydney Hailstorm - 14 April 1999 | publisher = Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate = 2006-10-05}}</ref> The city is also prone to [[flash flooding]] from enormous amounts of rain caused by East Coast Lows (a low pressure depression which deepens off the state usually in winter and early spring which can bring significant damage by heavy rain, cyclonic winds and huge swells). The most notable event was the great Sydney flood which occurred on 6 August 1986 and dumped a record {{convert|327.6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} on the city in 24 hours.

[[Sydney central business district|Sydney's central business district]] (CBD) extends southwards for about 3&nbsp;kilometres (1.25&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) from [[Sydney Cove]] to the area around [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]].

Although the CBD dominated the city's business and cultural life in the early days, other business/cultural districts have developed in a radial pattern since [[World War II]]. As a result, the proportion of white-collar jobs located in the CBD declined from more than 60 per cent at the end of World War II to less than 30 per cent in 2004.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Together with the commercial district of [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]], joined to the CBD by the Harbour Bridge, the most significant outer business districts are [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]<ref>{{cite web

Sydney also has several popular museums such as, the [[Australian Museum]] (natural history and anthropology), the [[Powerhouse Museum]] (science, technology and design), the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney|Museum of Contemporary Art]] and the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]].

===Sport and outdoor activities===
Sydney is well endowed with [[Parks in Sydney|open spaces]] and access to waterways, and has many natural areas even within the city centre. Within the [[Sydney central business district]] are the [[Chinese Garden of Friendship]], [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], [[The Domain]] and the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]]. The metropolitan area contains several [[national park]]s, including the [[Royal National Park]], the second oldest national park in the world and several parks in Sydney's far west which are part of the World Heritage listed [[Greater Blue Mountains Area]].<ref>NPWS website, [http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&ParkKey=N0030&Type=Xo Royal National Park]</ref>

{{see also|Sport in New South Wales}}
Sport is an important part of [[Sport in Sydney|Sydney's culture]]. The most popular sport in Sydney is [[rugby league]]. It was brought to the city from [[Northern England]] before spreading to other parts of Australia. The [[NSWRFL]] (today known as the [[National Rugby League|NRL]]) began in Sydney in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1908|1908]] and today is the largest{{Clarify me|date=May 2009}} rugby league competition in the world<!-- in terms of what ? number of teams ? -->{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. The city is home to nine of the sixteen teams currently in the [[National Rugby League]] competition. They are the: [[Canterbury Bulldogs]], [[Cronulla Sharks]], [[Manly Sea Eagles]], [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Parramatta Eels]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], [[Sydney Roosters]] and [[Wests Tigers]].
[[File:Telstra Stadium at Night.jpg|left|thumb|ANZ Stadium]]
Of the major football codes, [[Association football (soccer)]] and [[rugby union]] are also very popular and Sydney is home to the [[A-League]]'s [[Sydney FC]] and the [[Super 14|Super 14's]] [[NSW Waratahs]] respectively. Second tier competitions based in Sydney are the [[NSWPL]] and [[NSW Super League]] (football) and the [[Shute Shield]] (rugby union). Sydney also has an [[Australian Football League|AFL (Australian rules football)]] team called the [[Sydney Swans]], a Woman's [[netball]] team ([[New South Wales Swifts|Swifts]]), a [[baseball]] team ([[New South Wales Patriots|Patriots]]), a [[field hockey]] team ([[New South Wales Waratahs (field hockey)|Waratahs]]), 2 [[ice hockey]] teams ([[Penrith Bears]] / [[Sydney Ice Dogs]]) and a [[WNBL]] team (Sydney Uni Flames).

As the state capital, Sydney is the home of the [[NSW Blues|NSW Blues cricket team]] in the [[Sheffield Shield|Sheffield Shield cricket competition]], and the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|NSW Blues rugby league team]] in the annual [[Rugby League State of Origin]] series. Large sporting events such as the [[NRL Grand Final]] and [[Bledisloe Cup]] games are regularly held at the [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]], the main stadium for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]. Other events in Sydney include the start of the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]], the [[Golden Slipper]] horse race, and the [[City to Surf]] race. Prominent sporting venues in Sydney include the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]], [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]], The [[Sydney Football Stadium]], [[Eastern Creek Raceway]], [[Randwick Racecourse|Royal Randwick]] and [[Rosehill Gardens Racecourse]].

===Media===
{{main|Media in Sydney}}
Sydney has two main daily [[newspaper]]s. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' is a [[broadsheet]], and is Sydney's newspaper of record with extensive coverage of domestic and international news, culture and business. It is also the oldest extant newspaper in Australia, having been published regularly since 1831. The Herald's competitor, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', is a [[News Corporation]]-owned [[tabloid]]. Both papers have tabloid counterparts published on Sunday, The ''Sun-Herald'' and the ''Sunday Telegraph'', respectively.
[[File:Channel7Epping3.JPG|thumb|right|[[Seven Network]] broadcasting dishes in [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]].]]
The three commercial [[television]] networks ([[Seven Network|Seven]], [[Nine Network|Nine]], [[Network Ten|Ten]]), as well as the government national broadcast services ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) are headquartered in Sydney. Also a community television station, [[Television Sydney|TVS]], broadcasts in the Sydney area. Historically, the networks have been based in the northern suburbs, but the last decade has seen several move to the inner city. ''Nine'' has kept its headquarters north of the harbour, in [[Willoughby, New South Wales|Willoughby]]. ''Ten'' has its studios in a redeveloped section of the inner-city suburb of [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]], and ''Seven'' also has headquarters in Pyrmont, production studios at [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]]<!--change to Redfern when this happens later in 2008--> as well as a purpose-built news studio in [[Martin Place]] in the CBD. The ABC has a large headquarters and production facility in the inner-city suburb of [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] and SBS has its studios at [[Artarmon, New South Wales|Artarmon]]. [[Foxtel]] and [[Optus Television|Optus]] both supply pay-TV over their cable services to most parts of the urban area. The five free-to-air networks have provided [[digital television]] transmissions in Sydney since January 2000. Additional services recently introduced include the ABC's second channel ABC2 (Channel 22), SBS's world news service SBS2 (Channel 33), an on-air program guide (Channel 4), a news, sport, and weather items channel (Channel 41), ChannelNSW: Government and Public Information (Channel 45),<ref>{{cite web

Many [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] and [[Frequency modulation|FM]] government, commercial and community [[radio]] services broadcast in the Sydney area. The local [[ABC Local Radio|ABC]] radio station is [[702 ABC Sydney]] (formerly 2BL). The [[talkback radio]] genre is dominated by the perennial rivals [[2GB]] and [[2UE]]. Popular [[Music radio|music]] stations include [[Triple M]], [[2Day FM]] and [[Nova 96.9]], which generally targets people under 40. In the older end of the music radio market, [[Vega (radio network)|Vega]] and [[Mix 106.5|MIX 106.5]] target the 25 to 54 age group, while [[2WS|WS-FM]] targets the 40 to 54 age group with their [[Classic hits|Classic Hits]] format mostly focusing on the 70s & 80s. [[Triple J]] (national), [[2SER]] and [[FBi Radio]] provide a more independent, local and alternative sound. There are also a number of community stations broadcasting to a particular language group or local area.

Certain areas in Sydney are also being used for tests of digital radio broadcasting,<ref>[http://www.digitalradioaustralia.com.au/index.cfm?page_id=1015 Digital Radio Australia: Stations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Citation broken|date=December 2008}} which the government plans to roll out in the future to replace the existing analogue AM and FM networks in much the same way as they are doing with analogue and digital television at present.

==Governance==
[[File:Sydney councils.png|right|thumb|Sydney's Local Government Areas]] [[File:SydneyTownHall gobeirne.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Sydney Town Hall|Town Hall]], seat of the City Council]]
Apart from the limited role of the [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland County Council]] from 1945<U+2013>1964, there has never been an overall governing body for the Sydney metropolitan area; instead, the metropolitan area is divided into [[Local Government Areas in Australia|local government areas]] (LGAs). These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales State Government]], such as planning and garbage collection.

The [[City of Sydney]] includes the central business area and some adjoining inner suburbs, and has in recent years been expanded through amalgamation with adjoining local government areas, such as South Sydney. It is led by the elected [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]] and a council. The Lord Mayor, however, is sometimes treated as a representative of the whole city, for example during the Olympics.

Most citywide government activities are controlled by the state government. These include public transport, main roads, traffic control, policing, education above preschool level, and planning of major infrastructure projects. Because a large proportion of New South Wales' population lives in Sydney, state governments have traditionally been reluctant to allow the development of citywide governmental bodies, which would tend to rival the state government. For this reason, Sydney has always been a focus for the politics of both State and [[Government of Australia|Federal Parliaments]]. For example, the boundaries of the City of Sydney LGA have been significantly altered by state governments on at least four occasions since 1945, with expected advantageous effect to the governing party in the [[New South Wales]] Parliament at the time.<ref>Golder, Hilary, ''Sacked: Removing and Remaking the Sydney City Council'', Sydney, 2004.</ref>

The 38 LGAs commonly described as making up Sydney are:

Different organisations have varying definitions of which councils make up Sydney. The Local Government Association of New South Wales considers all LGAs lying entirely in [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland County]] as part of its 'Metro' group, which excludes Camden (classed in its 'Country' group).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgsa.org.au/www/html/323-local-government-association.asp?intSiteID=1|publisher="Local Government and Shires Associations of New South Wales"|title="About the Local Government Association of NSW"}}</ref> The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] defines a [[Sydney Statistical Division]] (the population figures of which are used in this article) that includes all of the above councils as well as Wollondilly, the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury, Gosford and Wyong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1216.0Jul%202007?OpenDocument|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|title=1216.0 - Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC), Jul 2007}}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:University of Sydney Main Quadrangle.jpg|right|thumb|The [[University of Sydney]] established in 1850, is the oldest university in Australia]]
{{main|Education in Sydney}}
Sydney is home to some of Australia's most prominent universities, and is the site of Australia's first university, the [[University of Sydney]] (ranked 37th in the world in 2008), established in 1850. There are five other [[Public university|public universities]] operating primarily in Sydney: the [[Australian Catholic University]] (two out of six campuses), [[Macquarie University]], [[University of New South Wales]], the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] and the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Other universities which operate secondary campuses in Sydney include the [[University of Notre Dame Australia]] and the [[University of Wollongong]].

There are four multi-campus government-funded [[Technical and Further Education]] (TAFE) institutes in Sydney, which provide [[Vocational education|vocational training]] at a tertiary level: the [[Sydney Institute of Technology]], [[Northern Sydney Institute of TAFE]], [[Western Sydney Institute of TAFE]] and [[South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE]].

Sydney has [[State school|public]], [[Parochial school|denominational]] and [[Private school|independent]] schools. Public schools, including pre-schools, primary and secondary schools, and special schools are administered by the [[New South Wales Department of Education and Training]]. There are four state-administered [[List of school education areas in New South Wales|education areas]] in Sydney, that together co-ordinate 919 schools.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Of the 30 [[Selective school (New South Wales)|selective high schools]] in the state, 25 are in Sydney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/schoolfind/types/shs_ahs_details.php|title=List of selective and agricultural high schools|accessdate=2007-08-08|author=New South Wales Department of Education and Training|authorlink=New South Wales Department of Education and Training|year=2005}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Health systems===
The [[Government of New South Wales]] operates the public [[hospital]]s in the Sydney metropolitan region. Management of these hospitals and other specialist health facilities is coordinated by 4 Area Health Services: Sydney South West (SSWAHS), Sydney West (SWAHS), Northern Sydney and Central Coast (NSCCAHS) and the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra (SESIAHS) Area Health Services. There are also a number of private hospitals in the city, many of which are aligned with religious organisations.

===Transport===
[[File:CircularQuaySydney.jpg|thumb|right|[[Circular Quay]], the main ferry terminal in Sydney]]

{{main|Public transport in Sydney}}
Most Sydney residents travel by car through the system of roads and [[motorways]]. The most important [[Trunk road|trunk routes]] in the urban area are the nine [[Metroad]]s, which include the {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} [[Sydney Orbital Network]]. Sydney is also served by extensive train, taxi, bus and ferry networks.

[[Railways in Sydney|Sydney trains]] are run by [[CityRail]], a corporation of the [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales State Government]]. Trains run as suburban [[Regional rail|commuter rail]] services in the outer suburbs, then converge in an underground city loop service in the central business district. In the years following the 2000 Olympics, CityRail's performance declined significantly.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Cityrail-millennium-M32-ext.jpg|thumb|left|An EDI [[Millennium train|M-set (Millennium) train]] at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]].]]
[[File:SydneyMonorail1 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|Sydney's [[Metro Monorail]].]]
Sydney has one privately operated [[light rail]] line, [[Metro Light Rail]], running from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Station]] to [[Lilyfield]] along a former goods train line. There is also the [[Metro Monorail]], which runs in a loop around the main shopping district and [[Darling Harbour]]. Sydney was once served by an extensive [[Trams in Sydney|tram network]], which was progressively closed in the 1950s and 1960s. Most parts of the metropolitan area are served by buses, many of which follow the pre-1961 tram routes. In the city and inner [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|suburbs]] the [[Public ownership|state-owned]] [[Sydney Buses]] has a monopoly. In the outer suburbs, service is contracted to many private bus companies. Construction of a network of [[bus rapid transit|rapid bus transitways]] in areas not previously well served by public transport began in 1999, and the first of these, the [[Liverpool-Parramatta Rapid Bus Transitway]], opened in February 2003. State government-owned [[Sydney Ferries]] runs numerous commuter and tourist ferry services on Sydney Harbour and the [[Parramatta River]].

[[Sydney Airport]], in the suburb of [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]], is Sydney's main airport, and is one of the oldest continually operated [[airport]]s in the world <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |title=Fact Sheet - Airport History |publisher=[[Sydney Airport]] |accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>. The smaller [[Bankstown Airport]] mainly serves private and [[general aviation]]. There is a light aviation airfield at [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]]. [[RAAF Base Richmond]] lies to the north-west of the city. The question of the need for a [[Second Sydney Airport]] has raised much controversy. A 2003 study found that Sydney Airport can manage as Sydney's sole [[international airport]] for 20 years, with a significant increase in airport traffic predicted.<ref>Finding of "The Sydney Airport Master Plan (2003)" referred to in: {{cite web |url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=2422677&TABLE=HANSARDR| title=Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 421) | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|work=[[Hansard]] | date=[[2005-05-10]]|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> The resulting expansion of the airport would have a substantial impact on the community, including additional [[aircraft noise]] affecting residents. Land has been acquired at [[Badgerys Creek, New South Wales|Badgerys Creek]] for a second airport, the site acting as a focal point of political argument.<ref>{{cite news | date=[[2007-08-19]] | work= The Sunday Telegraph | last=Dickens | first=Jim | title= Airport row to lift off again | publisher = News Corporation}}</ref>

===Utilities===
Water storage and supply for Sydney is managed by the [[Sydney Catchment Authority]], which is an agency of the NSW Government that sells bulk water to [[Sydney Water]] and other agencies. Water in the Sydney catchment is chiefly stored in dams in the [[Upper Nepean Scheme]], the [[Blue Mountains Dams|Blue Mountains]], [[Woronora Dam]], [[Warragamba Dam]] and the [[Shoalhaven Scheme]].<ref>Sydney Catchment Authority. [http://www.sca.nsw.gov.au/dams-and-water/water-supply-history History of Sydney's Water Supply System]</ref> Historically low water levels in the catchment have led to water use [[Water restrictions in Australia|restrictions]] and the NSW government is investigating alternative [[water supply]] options, including [[Greywater|grey water]] recycling and the construction of a seawater [[reverse osmosis]] desalination plant at Kurnell.<ref>Sydney Water. [http://www.sydneywater.com.au/EnsuringTheFuture/Desalination/index.cfm Sydney's desalination project]</ref> Sydney Water also collects the wastewater and sewage produced by the city.

Four companies supply natural gas and electricity to Sydney: [[Energy Australia]], [[AGL Energy|AGL]], [[Integral Energy]] and [[Origin Energy]]. <!--are there more?--> The natural gas supply for the city is sourced from the cooper basin in South Australia. Numerous telecommunications companies operate in Sydney providing terrestrial and mobile telecommunications services.
