'''Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier''' ([[August 26]] [[1743]] &ndash; [[May 8]] [[1794]]) the "''[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|father of modern chemistry]]''," was a [[France|French]] [[nobility|nobleman]] prominent in the histories of [[chemistry]], [[finance]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. 

He stated the first version of the [[Law of conservation of mass]], co-discovered, recognized and named [[oxygen]] (1778) as well as [[hydrogen]], disproved the [[phlogiston theory]], introduced the ''[[Metric system]]'', invented the first periodic table including 33 elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature.  He was also an investor and administrator of the "[[Ferme G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale]]," a private tax collection company; chairman of the board of the Discount Bank (later the [[Banque de France]]); and a powerful member of a number of other aristocratic administrative councils. 

Due to his prominence in the pre-revolutionary government in [[France]], he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] at the height of the [[French Revolution]].

== Early life ==
[[Image:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and his Wife'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]].]]
Born to a wealthy family in [[Paris]], Antoine Laurent Lavoisier inherited a large fortune when his mother died. He attended the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge des Quatre-Nations|College Mazarin]] from 1754 to 1761, studying [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]]. His education was filled with the ideals of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the time, and he felt fascination for Maquois' dictionary. His devotion and passion for chemistry was largely influenced by [[<U+00C9>tienne Condillac]], a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. In 1767 he worked on a geological survey of [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. He was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], France's most elite scientific society, at the age of 25 in 1768 for an essay on [[street lighting]] and in recognition for his earlier research. In 1769 he worked on the first geological map of [[France]]. 

In 1771, he married the 13-year-old [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]], the daughter of a co-owner of the Ferme. With time, she proved to be a scientific colleague to her husband. She translated documents from English for him, including [[Richard Kirwan]]'s "''Essay on Phlogiston''" and [[Joseph Priestley]]'s research. She created many [[drawing|sketches]] and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues. She also edited and published Lavoisier<U+2019>s memoirs and hosted many parties during which eminent scientists would discuss new chemical theories.

===Background===
Beginning in 1775, Lavoisier served in the [[Royal Gunpowder Administration]], where his work led to improvements in the production of [[gunpowder]] and the use of [[agricultural chemistry]] by designing a new method for preparing [[saltpeter]].
[[Image:Hidrogenexp1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Drawing|Hand sketch]] design aparatus for hydrogen combustion experiment made by Lavoisier in the 1780s.]]

===Major works===
Some of Lavoisier's most important experiments examined the nature of [[combustion]]
, or burning. Through these experiments, he demonstrated that burning is a process that involves the combination of a substance with oxygen. He also demonstrated the role of oxygen in metal rusting, as well as its role in animal and plant respiration: working with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Lavoisier conducted experiments that showed that respiration was essentially a slow combustion of organic material using inhaled oxygen. Lavoisier's explanation of combustion replaced the [[phlogiston]] theory, which postulates that materials release a substance called phlogiston when they burn.

===Research on hydrogen and his role in disproving the phlogiston theory===
[[Image:Hidrogenexp2.gif|thumb|170px|right|Apparatus for hydrogen combustion experiment made from Lavoisier's sketch by Jean Baptiste Meusnier in 1783.]]
He also discovered that the water of [[Henry Cavendish]] which he termed ''[[hydrogen]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "water-former"), combined with oxygen to produce a dew, as [[Joseph Priestley]] had reported, which appeared to be water. Lavoisier's work was partly based on the work of Priestley (he corresponded with Priestley and fellow members of the [[Lunar Society]]). However, he tried to take credit for Priestley's discoveries. This tendency to use the results of others without acknowledgment, then draw conclusions of his own, is said to be characteristic of Lavoisier. In "Sur la combustion en g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral" ("On Combustion in general," 1777) and "Consid<U+00E9>rations G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rales sur la Nature des Acides" ("General Considerations on the Nature of Acids," 1778), he demonstrated that the "air" responsible for combustion was also the source of acidity. In 1779, he named this part of the air "oxygen" (Greek for "acid-former"), and the other "azote" (Greek for "no life"). In "R<U+00E9>flexions sur la Phlogistique" ("Reflections on Phlogiston," 1783), Lavoisier showed the [[phlogiston theory]] to be inconsistent. It could also have been true that he could have argued against his own ideas.

===Pioneer of stoichiometry===
[[Image:Instruments_lavoisier.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Laboratory equipment|Laboratory instruments]] used by Lavoisier circa 1780s.]]
Lavoisier's experiments were among the first truly [[stoichiometry|quantitative chemical experiments]] ever performed; that is, he carefully weighed the reactants and products involved, a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. He showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the quantity of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical reaction. He burnt derka phosphorus and sulphur in air, and proved that the products weighed more than the original. Nevertheless, the weight gained was lost from the air. These experiments provided evidence for the law of the conservation of matter, or in other words, the [[law of conservation of mass]].

===Major works on analytical chemistry and chemical nomenclature===

Lavoisier also investigated the composition of water and air, which at the time were considered elements. He discovered the components of water were oxygen and hydrogen, and that air was a mixture of gases - primarily [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. With the French chemists [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], [[Antoine Fran<U+00E7>ois, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine Fourcroy]] and [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau|Guyton de Morveau]], Lavoisier devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names describing the structure of chemical compounds. He described it in ''M<U+00E9>thode de nomenclature chimique'' (''Method of Chemical Nomenclature'', 1787). Their system facilitated communication of discoveries between chemists of different backgrounds and is still largely in use today, including names such as sulfuric acid, sulfates, and sulfites.

His ''Trait<U+00E9> <U+00C9>l<U+00E9>mentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry'', 1789, translated into English by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]]) is considered to be the first modern chemical [[textbook]], and presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]], and denied the existence of phlogiston. Also, Lavoisier clarified the concept of an element as a simple substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and he devised a theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. 

[[Image:Lentilles_ardentes.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Combustion, generated by focusing sun light over [[flammable]] materials using lenses, experiment conducted by Lavosier circa 1770s.]]
In addition, it contained a list of elements, or substances that could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[sulphur]]. It also forms the basis for the modern list of elements. His list, however, also included light and [[Caloric theory|caloric]], which he believed to be material substances. While many leading chemists of the time refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

===Aftermath===
Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of [[chemical balance]], used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous). Lavoisier also made introductory research on physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiment with [[Laplace]], when he used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually they found the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion. 
[[Image:Calorimeter.gif|thumb|115px|left|Constant [[pressure]] [[calorimeter]] made by Lavoisier for chemical [[enthalpy]] experiment.]]

He also made remarkable contributions to [[chemical bond]]ing by stating the radical theory, believing that [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which function as a single group in a chemical reaction, would combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of [[allotropy|allotropy in chemical elements]] when he discovered that [[diamond]] is a crystalline form of carbon.

He also updated many chemical concepts, for the first time the modern notion of elements was laid out systematically; the three or four elements of classical chemistry gave way to the modern system, and Lavoisier worked out reactions in chemical equations that respect the conservation of mass (see, for example, the [[nitrogen cycle]]).[[Image:Lavoisier_humanexp.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Lavoisier conducting an experiment in the 1770s.]] 
His contributions are considered the most important in advancing the science of chemistry to the level of what had been achieved in physics and mathematics during 18th century. <ref>Charles C. Gillespie, Foreword to ''Lavoisier'' by Jean-Pierre Poirier, University of Pennslyvania Press, English Edition, 1996. </ref>

== Contributions to biology ==
Lavoisier used a [[calorimeter]] to measure heat production as a result of respiration in a [[guinea pig]]. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of 0 <U+00B0>C around an inner shell filled with ice.  The guinea pig in the center of the chamber produced heat which melted the ice.  The water which flowed out of the calorimeter was collected and weighed.  1 kg melted ice = 80 kcal heat production by the guinea pig.  He concluded, "la respiration est donc une combustion." That is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.<ref>[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S Is a Calorie a Calorie?] American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol. 79, No. 5, 899S-906S, May 2004</ref>

== Law and politics ==
Of key significance in Lavoisier's life was his study of [[law]]. He received a [[law degree]] and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]], but never practiced as a [[lawyer]]. He did become interested in French [[politics]], and as a result, he obtained a position as [[tax]] collector in the ''[[Ferme G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale]]'', a [[tax farming (France)|tax farming]] company, at the age of 26, where he attempted to introduce reforms in the French [[monetary system|monetary]] and [[tax]]ation system. While in government work, he helped develop the [[SI|metric system]] to secure uniformity of [[weights and measures]] throughout France.

==Execution==
As one of 28 French tax collectors and a powerful figure in the unpopular Ferme G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale, Lavoisier was branded a traitor during the Reign of Terror by [[French Revolution|revolutionists]] in 1794. He was tried, convicted, and executed on the same day in Paris, at the age of 51. Ironically, Lavoisier was one of the few liberals in his position. One of his actions that may have sealed his fate was a [[wikt:contretemps|contretemps]] a few years earlier with the young [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who subsequently became a leading revolutionary.

An appeal to spare his life was cut short by the judge: "The Republic has no need of geniuses [or, alternately, "scientists"]."

There was a modern unfounded rumour or "urban legend" that before his beheading, he had friends of his watch his head carefully so that some conclusions might be drawn about the loss of consciousness.<ref>{{cite web

His importance for science was expressed by the mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] who lamented the beheading by saying: "It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another like it in a century."

One and a half years following his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. When his private belongings were delivered to his widow, a brief note was included reading "To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted."

About a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier's head for the statue, but used a spare head of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier's last years. Lack of money prevented alterations being made. The statue was melted down during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and has never been replaced. However, there is a street in the 8th [[arrondissement]] of Paris named after him.
