'''James Edward "Pete" Runnels''' ([[January 28]], [[1928]] - [[May 20]], [[1991]]) was a [[Major League Baseball]]  [[infielder]] who played for the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] (1951-57), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1958-62) and [[Houston Astros|Houston Colt .45s]] (1963-64). He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Runnels was born in [[Lufkin, Texas]]. A master at handling the bat, he was a notorious [[Single (baseball)|singles]] hitter who had one of the best eyes in the game, compiling an outstanding 1.35 [[walk-to-strikeout ratio]] (844-to-627). Altogether he [[Batting average|batted]] over .300 six times, once with the Senators, five with the Red Sox. 

Solid and versatile with the glove, Runnels started as  a [[shortstop]] with the Senators, but ultimately played 644 games at [[First baseman|first base]], 642 at [[Second baseman|second]], 463 at shortstop, and 49 at [[Third baseman|third]]. Twice he led the [[American League]] in [[fielding percentage]], at second base in 1960 (.986) and at first base in 1961 (.995).

In five seasons with Boston Runnels never hits less than .314 ([[1959 in baseball|1959]]), winning two [[Batting average|batting]] crowns in [[1960 in baseball|1960]] (.320) and [[1962 in baseball|1962]] (.326), and just missed one by six points with his teammate [[Ted Williams]] on the final day of the [[1958 in baseball|1958]] season (.328 to .322). On August 30, [[1960 in sports|1960]], in a double-header against the [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]], Runnels hit 6-for-7 in the first game (including a game-winning [[Run batted in|RBI]]-[[Double (baseball)|double]] in the 15th inning) and 3-for-4 in the second, tying a Major League record for hits in a double-header (9). After winning his batting title in 1962, Runnels was traded to the Houston Colt .45s (forerunners of the [[Houston Astros|Astros]]). He was released early in the [[1964 in baseball|1964]] season.

Runnels was a career .291 hitter (1854-for-6373) with 49 home runs, 630 RBI, 876 [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs]], 282 doubles, 64 [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], 37 [[stolen base]]s, and a .375 [[on base percentage]] in 1799 games. He was selected an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in 1959, 1960 and 1962, and he also [[Coach (baseball)|coached]] for the Red Sox in 1965-66, serving as an interim [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] for the last 16 games of the [[1966 in baseball|1966]] season. Under Runnels, the Sox played .500 baseball and escaped last place by one-half game.

Pete Runnels died in [[Pasadena, Texas]]. He was inducted to the [[Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame]] in November [[2004 in sports|2004]].
