{{lowercase|est and The Forum in popular culture}}
[[Werner Erhard]] and his [[self-improvement]] courses have been referenced in [[popular culture]] in various forms of [[fiction]]al media including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[theatre]].  These courses, known as ''est'', are delivered by the company [[Erhard Seminars Training]]. Under the name ''The Forum'', they are delivered by [[Werner Erhard and Associates]].  The successor course to ''The Forum'', ''[[Landmark Forum]],'' has had an influence on popular culture.  Some of these works have taken a [[comedy|comedic]] tack, parodying Erhard and satirizing the methodology used in the courses he founded.  Yet other works have taken a more direct approach, and analyzed and questioned Erhard's early life and controversy through fictionalized accounts.  Erhard read the [[science fiction]] book ''[[est: The Steersman Handbook|est: The Steersman Handbook, Charts of the Coming Decade of Conflict]]'', by L. Clark Stevens before developing ''est'': note the convention of  printing ''est'' in all lower-case stems from the title of this work.  In Larry Brooks' 2001 novel ''Pressure Points'', the characters compare programs devised by [[Werner Erhard]], [[William Penn Patrick]], and [[Alexander Everett]]. In Gregg Hurwitz's 2004 novel ''[[The Program (novel)|The Program]]'' groups analyzed include [[Lifespring]], Sullivanians, and a fictional "psychotherapeutic cult."  Werner Erhard is cited before the story begins.  

Both ''est'' and ''The Forum'' have been depicted explicitly more often in film and television than in literary works.  The 1977 film ''[[Semi-Tough]]'' satirized Erhard and the ''est Training'', through the fictional "Bismark Earthwalk Action Training."  [[Bert Convy]] portrayed the Erhard parody character, and his performance was positively received.  Media of the time period appreciated the satire and likened Convy's portrayal to Erhard. Actress [[Diana Ross]] and writer [[Joel Schumacher]], both ''est'' students, later incorporated Werner Erhard's teachings into the 1978 [[Musical film|musical film]], ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]''.  The 1990 film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'' also parodied ''est'', where [[Rob Reiner]] portrayed an abusive trainer for the est-like "Be, Inc. Seminars."  Movie critics have also drawn parallels to ''est'' and Werner Erhard, in reviews of the films ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''.  In ''Fight Club'', [[Roger Ebert]] compared Erhard to [[Brad Pitt]]'s Tyler Durden character, and in ''Magnolia'', [[Tom Cruise]]'s portrayal of motivational guru named Frank T.J. Mackey was likened to Erhard as well.  Concepts from the [[Landmark Forum]] were utilized by the [[Wachowski brothers]] in their film ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', including the concept of "choice and decision" and "being" in an experience.  Werner Erhard's training programs have been parodied in television. The 1979 episode of  ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' ttled "[[Mork Goes Erk]]" and the 2002 episode of ''[[Six Feet Under]]'' titled  "[[The Plan (Six Feet Under episode)|The Plan]]" are the most notable.  In the ''Mork & Mindy'' episode, the Erhard parody character was played by [[David Letterman]].

[[Madison, Wisconsin]]'s Broom Street Theatre produced a play about Werner Erhard and ''The Forum'' in 1995, called ''Devil In Paradise, The Fall and Rise of Werner Erhard.''  This piece dealt with a fictionalized version of controversial issues surrounding Erhard, including his early life before success with the ''est Training'' and allegations of familial abuse.  The play received a positive review in the local paper, ''[[The Capital Times]]''.  Representatives of Erhard later contacted ''The Capital Times'', and the paper issued a correction which highlighted points directly addressed by Erhard's people.

Werner Erhard drew on [[non-fiction]] sources when he developed Erhard Seminars Training, including the [[self-help]] course [[Mind Dynamics]], [[cybernetics]], the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' by [[Napoleon Hill]], [[Scientology]] courses and the writings of its founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]].<ref name="pressman" /><ref name="conway" /><ref name="larson" />  However, Erhard's self awareness courses were also influenced by a [[science fiction]] book he read shortly before forming ''est'', called: ''[[est: The Steersman Handbook|est: The Steersman Handbook, Charts of the Coming Decade of Conflict]]'', by L.

Werner Erhard and his ''est Training'' programs and later ''The Forum'' have been parodied in films, both directly and through more subtle references.  Still in other films that did not directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional [[self-help]] films.  The 1977 movie ''[[Semi-Tough]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]], parodied the est training.<ref name="mulligan">{{cite book | last = Mulligan | first = Pat | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Life and Times of a Hollywood Bad Boy  | publisher = AuthorHouse | date = 2006 | location = | pages = 94 | url = | doi = | id =  1425950086}}</ref>  [[Bert Convy]] played "Frederick Bismark," a caricature of [[Werner Erhard]].

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: "The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard."<ref>{{cite news  | last = Staff  | first =  | coauthors = | title = Our Reynolds Rap -- Burt Is Inert; | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Dow Jones & Company]] | date = May 27, 2005 | url =

During actual filming on ''Semi-Tough'', Convy received a late-night phone call from actress [[Valerie Harper]], known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard.  She related to Convy that Erhard was "pleased" with the role, and she wished him success in the film.  However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film.<ref name="silvester" />

Goldman noted that the episode spent time: "lampooning Werner Erhard and ''est''-like commercial pop psychologies."  However, Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with "Ellsworth Revitalization Conditioning" was not the training - but Ellsworth himself.  Ellsworth is seen not just as a parody of Werner Erhard, but also of [[consumerism]]: "As the self-help entrepreneur, Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle-status points and sign-values ("I've got my Rolls-Royce!"). Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality."  Goldman explained that the ''Mork and Mindy'' episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training, and criticism of Ellsworth, citing Ellsworth's character traits of: "tyranny, selfishness, open greed, and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money-making."  In the end of the segment of the episode parodying est, [[Mork]] wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal [[Humanism|humanistic]] moral values.<ref name="goldman" />  David Letterman received positive praise for his portrayal of "Ellsworth" in the episode.<ref name="amg">{{cite news  | last = Tobey  | first = Matthew | coauthors = | title = Mork & Mindy: Mork Goes Erk | work = [[All Movie Guide]]  | pages =  | language = | publisher = All Media Guide, LLC. | date = | url =http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:314015 | accessdate =  2007-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Liebenson  | first =Donald | coauthors = | title = Mork & Mindy - The Complete First Season (1978): Amazon.com essential video | work = [[Amazon.com]] | pages =Editorial Reviews | language = | publisher = Amazon.com, Inc. | date = 2004 | url = http://www.amazon.com/Mork-Mindy-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0002I837M| accessdate = 2007-10-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Staff  | first = | coauthors = | title = Mork & Mindy | work = [[Dallas Morning News]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =November 5, 2004 | url = | accessdate =  }}</ref>

''[[Six Feet Under]]'' [[List of Six Feet Under episodes|Episode 16]], of Season 2, [[The Plan (Six Feet Under episode)|"The Plan"]], featured a seminar-delivery organization called "The Plan", which the character [[Claire Fisher]] immediately compared to ''est''.  Actress [[Alice Krige]] portrays "Alma" the seminar leader of "The Plan" - who uses [[jargon]] related to the "blueprint" for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement.  She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up."  Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do "homework" from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will "renovate" her life.  During the following day of "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to "renovate their homes" together.  In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for "knocking down her old house", and proceeds to tell her that now she can rebuild a new house.<ref name="yahootv">{{cite news | last = Staff | first = | coauthors = [[Television Without Pity]] | title = Six Feet Under, The Plan, Recap | work = [[Yahoo!

In February 1995, the Broom Street Theatre in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] produced a play entitled: ''Devil In Paradise, The Fall and Rise of Werner Erhard.''<ref name="broomstreet">{{cite web

</ref>  The play was written and directed by Joel Gersmann, and performed with a cast of seven actors.<ref name="broomstreet" />  The play was described as "a fascinating character study of the man who founded the wildly successful "human potential movement," as well as the many people who bought into it."<ref name="chase" />  The work was a satire of Erhard, which educated the audience about a (fictionalized) rendition of his early life, but the piece was also criticized for its lack of structure.  Short scenes and blackouts were described as confusing, and yet Gersmann's script itself was seen as a success.<ref name="chase" />

The production was reviewed in ''[[The Capital Times]]'' in March 1995, and the staff of ''The Capital Times'' was later contacted by representatives of Werner Erhard, and asked to issue a correction regarding statements made in the review.<ref name="chase">{{cite news

</ref>  The paper later issued a correction, which emphasized that the play was indeed a fictionalized account, and stated that: "Erhard never admitted abusing his children, and his daughter retracted in July 1992 her earlier allegation of sexual abuse by her father."<ref name="chase" />  The correction also noted that Erhard did not leave the [[United States]] to avoid any [[Internal Revenue Service]] investigation, but rather was contesting certain business deductions and had not been charged with [[tax evasion]].  The statement sent by Erhard's representatives concluded by noting: "Erhard denies that the programs he created, est and the Forum, were or are pyramid selling schemes, self-help programs or mind therapy movement."<ref name="chase" />
