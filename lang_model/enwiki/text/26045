'''Richard Dwight "Richie" Farmer''' (born August 25, 1969) is an American former collegiate basketball player and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politician from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. He served as the Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012 and was the running mate of [[David L. Williams (politician)|David L. Williams]] in the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2011|2011 gubernatorial election]]. After leaving office, Farmer was investigated for violating state campaign finance laws and misappropriating state resources and was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison along with a concurrent 12 months in state prison.

A [[point guard]], Farmer led [[Clay County High School]] to the 1987 [[Sweet Sixteen (KHSAA State Basketball Championship)|Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship]] and, in 1988, was named [[Kentucky Mr. Basketball]] and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a championship game record with 51 points in a losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]], Coach [[Eddie Sutton]] was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer announced that he would visit other colleges and issued a deadline past which he would no longer consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the [[University of Kentucky]].

Kentucky struggled during Farmer's freshman year, finishing with a 13<U+2013>19 record, and by mid-season, fans were accusing Sutton of unfairly favoring his son, [[Sean Sutton|Sean]], over Farmer at the point guard position. Sutton resigned in the offseason due to a pay-for-play scandal for which the [[NCAA]] banned Kentucky from postseason play for two years. Sutton's replacement, [[Rick Pitino]], instituted a rigorous conditioning program and fast-paced style of play that improved Farmer's performance. After spending his junior season as a backup to [[Sean Woods]], Farmer transitioned to [[shooting guard]] and became a starter in the middle of his senior year. Again eligible for postseason competition, the Wildcats won the [[Southeastern Conference]] tournament and reached the Regional Finals of the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992 NCAA Tournament]], losing in overtime on a last-second shot by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]'s [[Christian Laettner]] in [[The Shot (Duke<U+2013>Kentucky)|a game]] regarded by many as the greatest college basketball game ever played. The team's seniors &ndash; Farmer, Woods, [[John Pelphrey]], and [[Deron Feldhaus]] &ndash; were dubbed "The Unforgettables", and their jerseys were hung from the rafters of [[Rupp Arena]] following the [[1991<U+2013>92 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|1991&ndash;92 season]].

Farmer parlayed his status as a basketball icon into two terms as Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012, winning both elections by large margins. In 2011, [[President of the Kentucky Senate|Kentucky Senate President]] David L. Williams tapped Farmer &ndash; considered a rising star in the state Republican Party &ndash; as his running mate in the gubernatorial election. They were defeated by Democratic Governor [[Steve Beshear]] and his running mate [[Jerry Abramson]]. During the campaign, media reports alleged that Farmer had misused state funds and property as agriculture commissioner and Farmer's successor collaborated with the state auditor to investigate the allegations. As a result, the Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 ethics violations &ndash; the most against an individual in state history. [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Attorney General]] [[Jack Conway (politician)|Jack Conway]] also charged Farmer with violating state [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance laws]], and a federal [[grand jury]] followed with five [[indictment]]s for abuses of power. Farmer initially contested the charges, but later agreed to a [[plea bargain]]. On January 14, 2014, Farmer was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $120,500 in [[restitution]] and $65,000 in fines. As of 2015, he is an inmate at a satellite camp of the [[United States Penitentiary, Hazelton]] near [[Bruceton Mills, West Virginia]].

Despite Farmer's prolific scoring, recruiters expressed concern about his small stature and lack of quickness.<ref name=chance /> Even while lauding his skills, ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' sportswriter Mike Fields wrote that Farmer had "heavy legs and slow-going style".<ref name=chance /> Regarding Farmer's size, Fields noted that, despite playing point guard, Farmer consistently [[Jump ball|jumped center]] for Clay County and could jump high enough to execute a two-handed [[slam dunk]].<ref name=chance /> The ''Herald-Leader'''s Billy Reed compared Farmer to [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]]'s [[Steve Alford]], who overcame doubts about his size, speed, and defense to become the Hoosiers' all-time leading scorer and lead them to an NCAA Championship in [[1986<U+2013>87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1987]].<ref name=farmerred>{{cite news |last=Reed |first=Billy |title=Can You Picture Cardinal Red in Clay County? |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=March 23, 1988 |page=C1}}</ref>

Farmer waited until three weeks before the [[primary election]] to begin seriously campaigning and focused on population centers such as Lexington, Louisville, [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], and the [[Northern Kentucky]] area, where Republican voters were more concentrated.<ref name=03primaryresults>{{cite news |last=Patton |first=Janet |title=Ag Chief: Baesler Faces Farmer &ndash; Winners Tied to UK Hoops |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=May 21, 2003 |page=A16}}</ref> At that time, campaign finance reports showed that Farmer had spent about half of the $36,055 raised for his campaign, while his opponent, Leonard "Buck" Beasley, had raised only $450 and spent nothing.<ref name=03primaryspending>{{cite news |last=Biesk |first=Joe |title=Democrats Lead Money Races &ndash; Stumbo, Luallen Dominating Foes in Primary Fields |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=April 25, 2003 |page=B5}}</ref> While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department, Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state's agricultural sector, cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products, and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry, saying "Farmers have a great story to tell, and I will use any name recognition I have gained through my experience with UK basketball to help them tell it."<ref name=03primary>{{cite news |last=Schreiner |first=Bruce |title=Candidate Urges Higher Cigarette Tax &ndash; Ag Commissioner Hopefuls Talk About Platforms |newspaper=The Kentucky Post |location=[[Cincinnati, Ohio]] |date=April 16, 2003 |page=C2}}</ref><ref name=03primary2>{{cite news |last=Patton |first=Janet |title=Farming Outlook Fraught with Uncertainty &ndash; Commissioner of Agriculture |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=May 16, 2003 |page=B1}}</ref><ref name=03primaryresults2>{{cite news |last=Schreiner |first=Bruce |title=Baesler Versus Farmer in Commissioner Race |newspaper=The Kentucky Post |location=[[Cincinnati, Ohio]] |date=May 21, 2003 |page=K6}}</ref> He also raised the possibility of engaging other former basketball players to promote the work of the agriculture department and indicated that he would lobby to have half of Kentucky's allocation of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] directed to the state's Agriculture Development Board.<ref name=03primaryresults />

At an August debate in [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]], Farmer proposed the cross-promotion of Kentucky agricultural products and the [[List of Kentucky state parks|state park system]], awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souveniers and perks during stays at state parks.<ref name=03debate>{{cite news |last=Lawrence |first=Keith |title=Agriculture Commissioner Candidates Tout Ideas at Debate |newspaper=The Messenger-Inquirer |location=[[Owensboro, Kentucky]] |date=August 8, 2003 |page=4}}</ref> On October 21, ''[[The Kentucky Post]]'' gave Baesler its endorsement, contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events.<ref name=03kypostendorse>{{cite news |title=A True Farmer |newspaper=The Kentucky Post |location=[[Cincinnati, Ohio]] |date=October 21, 2003 |page=K4}}</ref> Later that week, the ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' also endorsed Baesler, and followed up the next day with an article noting that, as of October 3, nearly one-third of the $87,825.20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives &ndash; including his parents, brother, sister, and in-laws &ndash; for salaries and campaign-related reimbursements.<ref name=family>{{cite news |last=Patton |first=Janet |title=Farmer Relatives Draw Salaries from Campaign Coffers &ndash; Father is Paid $20,000 to Serve as Treasurer |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=October 26, 2003 |page=B1}}</ref><ref name=03lhlendorsement>{{cite news |title=A Help to Farmers &ndash; Baesler Has Credentials for Agriculture Post |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=October 24, 2003 |page=A12}}</ref> Interviewed by phone, Farmer responded, "[My family has] probably worked 60, 70, 80 hours a week campaigning for me trying to get me elected.

Questions about Farmer's use of taxpayer funds continued to dog him throughout the general election campaign.

Five days after Farmer left office, Comer announced that he had requested a full audit of the department by newly elected Democratic State Auditor [[Adam Edelen]].<ref name=audit>{{cite news |last=Patton |first=Janet |title=New Ag Chief Seeks Audit &ndash; Departmental Issues Raised About Richie Farmer's Tenure |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=January 12, 2012 |page=A1}}</ref> Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items of missing agriculture department property valued at about $334,000 and another 103 items worth about $146,000 that were supposed to be returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for.<ref name=items>{{cite news |last=Patton |first=Janet |title=$500,000 in Ag Items Unaccounted For &ndash; State Property That's Missing Includes At Least 110 Computers, 3 Vans |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=January 13, 2012 |page=A1}}</ref> A week later, Farmer returned some of the missing items.<ref name=returnitems>{{cite news |last=Patton |first=Janet |title=Farmer Gives Back Some State Equipment &ndash; 2 Laptops and 2 GPS Units Remain Missing |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=January 20, 2012 |page=A3}}</ref>
