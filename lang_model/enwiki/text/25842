"'''In the Name of the Grandfather'''" is the fourteenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twentieth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It first aired on [[Sky1]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]], March 17, 2009 and aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on March 22, 2009. It was the first episode of the show to premiere in Europe before airing on Fox. In the episode, the Simpsons buy a new hot tub and spend so much time relaxing in it that they neglect [[Abraham Simpson|Abraham "Grampa" Simpson]]. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] decides to make it up to Grampa by helping him do one thing he wants to do. Grampa reminisces about O'Flanagan's pub in Ireland where he once had the best night of his life so the Simpsons travel there. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] visit various Irish landmarks while Homer and Grampa buy O'Flanagan's during a night of binge drinking and soon discover that pubs are no longer popular in Ireland.

"In the Name of the Grandfather" was directed by [[Ralph Sosa]] and was the first episode of the show to be written by Matt Marshall. Marshall pitched the idea in 2007 and the script was ready for a [[Read-through|table read]] later that year, but the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]] delayed work on the episode. Described by executive producer [[Al Jean]] as "an affectionate love letter to Ireland," the episode was inspired by a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article about the effects of [[Smoking ban#Ireland|Ireland's smoking ban]] on pubs. Guest stars for the episode include [[Colm Meaney]] as Tom O'Flanagan, [[Glen Hansard]] as a [[Busker|street musician]] and [[Mark<U+00E9>ta Irglov<U+00E1>]] as an [[Eastern Europea]]n woman. [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Kathy Ireland]] were also reported to have roles in the episode but neither appeared in the final version. The episode contains numerous jokes about Ireland and references to Irish culture including [[Giant's Causeway]], [[Blarney Castle]], [[James Joyce]], [[Bloomsday]], [[leprechaun]]s, [[Guinness]], ''[[Riverdance]]'', [[U2]] and the film ''[[Once (film)|Once]]''.

The special broadcast of the episode in Ireland was part of Fox's year-long "[[The Simpsons (season 20)#20th anniversary|Best. 20 Years. Ever.]]" celebration which commemorates the 20th anniversary of the show. To promote the broadcast, Jean, Brooks and voice actor [[Nancy Cartwright]] visited Ireland and participated in the Saint Patrick's Day parade in [[Dublin]]. Critics in Ireland mostly enjoyed the jokes about the nation but felt that the episode itself was average. The initial broadcast on Sky1 in Ireland was watched by 511,000 viewers, with a 33% share making it the most watched Sky1 broadcast in Ireland ever. In the United Kingdom, an average of 957,000 viewers (with a 4.7% share) watched. The first airing of the episode on Fox in the United States finished with a 3.6 [[Nielsen rating]] and was viewed in 6.15 million homes, finishing third in its timeslot.

==Plot==
[[Image:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The [[Giant's Causeway]] was one of the locations visited in the episode.]]
The Simpson family visits a home and garden show where they decide to purchase a [[hot tub]]. They spend hours soaking in the tub and become so relaxed that they forget to visit [[Abraham Simpson|Abraham "Grampa" Simpson]] at a family event. Grampa angrily unplugs and destroys the hot tub. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] decides to make up for their neglect and decides to do something Grampa wants to do. Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, [[Ireland]] called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics. The pub itself has run out of business as many of the patrons are now yuppies and have no interest in drinking. The pub owner Tom O'Flanagan is happy to have customers again. Homer and Grampa sit down at the pub and start drinking while [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] visit various Irish landmarks. They visit the [[Giant's Causeway]], [[Blarney Castle]], the [[Guinness]] brewery and [[Dublin]].

After a long night of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and discover that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business because pubs are no longer popular. Homer gets help from [[Moe Syzlak]], who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is illegal in Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a [[smokeasy]]. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America with a small fine.

Previous episodes of the show where the Simpsons visit other countries have been controversial. For example, the Simpsons visited Australia in "[[Bart vs. Australia]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1995) and Brazil in "[[Blame it on Lisa]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 13)|season 13]], 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries.<ref name="iT2"/> In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board&mdash;who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations&mdash;went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1931551.stm|title=Simpsons apologize to Rio|date=2002-04-15|accessdate=2009-03-17|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> When asked whether he thought this episode would generate similar controversies, Al Jean replied "I'm Irish American and I know Irish people have an excellent sense of humor so we weren't very worried."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gnews.com/entertainment/St-Patrick%E2%80%99s-Day-Simpsons-Special-First-Ireland-Release-731731436321.html|title=St Patrick<U+2019>s Day Simpsons Special First Ireland Release|author=Henson, Benny|publisher=GNews|date=2009-03-17|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref>

Shane Hegarty of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' wrote that it "may not have been a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish perspective it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves through the eyes of the greatest comedy series ever written." He added that "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [''[[sic]]''] views of it."<ref name="stereotypes">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0317/breaking39.htm|work=The Irish Times|author=Hegarty, Shane|date=2009-03-17|accessdate=2009-03-17|title=Simpsons goes heavy on the stereotypes}}</ref> Pat Stacey of the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' gave the episode two stars.

Robert Canning of [[IGN]] wrote "It wasn't the funniest of foreign land adventures, but it was serviceable. [...] The saving grace of the episode was all the Irish-centric vignettes with Marge and the kids.
