==Design and development==
Designer Mark Beierle's original goals were an "airplane with the feel of a hang glider, the agility and visibility of a helicopter, the effortless smooth flight of a sailplane, and the utility and economy of a general aviation aircraft--all in the hopes of getting close to the feel and freedom of a bird." When queried by interviewer Don Downie if that was too much to ask, Beierle replied, "You bet! But it didn't stop me from trying."<ref name="DownieJune2000"> {{Cite news|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-61962801/gull-report-flying-building.html|title = The Gull Report.(flying building Ultralight aircraft personal narratives)|accessdate = 26 January 2011|last = Downie|first = Don|authorlink = |date=June 2000| work = KitPlanes}}</ref>

The Thunder Gull was introduced in 1987 as a development of the earlier ''Laughing Gull''. The aircraft was quite revolutionary when it was introduced due to its high performance and particularly high cruise speed of {{convert|55|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on just {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Cliche" />

The aircraft is constructed from aluminum tubing and sheet parts and covered in [[aircraft fabric]]. The aircraft can meet the requirements of the US [[FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles]] category, including its maximum empty weight limitation of {{convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} when it is equipped with a lightweight engine.<ref name="Cliche" />

The aircraft has a very small wing for the US ultralight category with a wing area of only {{convert|95|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and a wingspan of {{convert|17.6|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}. The wing is equipped with [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] that give it a stall speed of {{convert|25|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The small wing gives the aircraft a high cruise speed and better resistance to turbulence than a lighter-loaded wing. The one-piece wing is quickly removable for storage or transport.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" />

Reported construction time from the kit is 150 hours.<ref name="Cliche" />

==Operational history==
The prototype Laughing Gull was flown coast-to-coast across the USA seven times with {{convert|100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of baggage and a {{convert|180|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} pilot.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

==Variants==
;Laughing Gull
:Original model introduced in 1976. First models had wire bracing and later [[strut]]-bracing before development of the cantilever wing. Production completed.<ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="DownieJune2000" />
;Thunder Gull
:Single seat, high wing ultralight aircraft with a cantilever {{convert|17.6|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wing. The name was changed from ''Laughing Gull'' for marketing purposes. Production completed.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="DownieJune2000" />
;Thunder Gull J
:Improved model with {{convert|20|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wingspan. Standard engine is the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 277]] and the acceptable power range is {{convert|28|to|53|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. First flight was March 1987 and it was available as a kit or ready-to-fly. Production completed.<ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2000" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2001" />
;Thunder Gull JT2
:Two-seats in [[tandem]] model with dual controls and a {{convert|24|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wingspan. Standard engine is the {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 503]] and the acceptable power range is {{convert|40|to|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 582]] and {{convert|75|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 618]] two-stroke engines were optional. It was available as a kit or ready-to-fly and production is completed. First flight was June 1989.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2000" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2001" />
;Thunder Gull Odyssey
:Two-seats in an unusual staggered [[side-by-side configuration]] with dual controls in the form of a shared center stick and a {{convert|26|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wingspan. The staggered seating was used to provide most of the benefits of side-by-side seating without the associated drag penalty. The seat stagger is sufficient to provide pilot shoulder clearance. Standard engine is the {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 503]] and the acceptable power range is {{convert|40|to|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[HKS 700E]] has also been installed. It first flew in April 1995 and was introduced at [[Sun 'n Fun]] in 1995. It is available as a kit or ready-to-fly. Fifteen were reported as completed by December 2011 and still in production in 2012.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2000" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2001" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2003" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2004" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2007" /><ref name="EarthstarModels" /><ref name="DownieJune2000" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2011" /><ref name="WDLA11">Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12'', page 43.

;Soaring Gull
:[[Motorglider]] version with {{convert|28|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wingspan and 16:1 glide ratio. Standard engine was the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 277]] and the later the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Hirth F-33]]. The acceptable power range is {{convert|28|to|53|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. First flew in November 1993. Ten reported as completed by December 2011 and still in production in 2012.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2000" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2001" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2004" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2007" /><ref name="EarthstarModels" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2011" /><ref name="WDLA11" />
;Gull 2000
:Updated version with {{convert|20|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wingspan, wider cockpit enclosure built from [[fiberglas]]. Standard engine was the [[Zanzottera MZ 34]] of {{convert|27|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the later the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Hirth F-33]]. The acceptable power range is {{convert|27|to|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Fifteen reported as completed by December 2011 and still in production in 2012.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2000" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2001" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2003" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2004" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2007" /><ref name="EarthstarModels" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2011" /><ref name="WDLA11" />
