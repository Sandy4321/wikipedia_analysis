Posted to the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in May 1941, he became Commanding Officer of [[No.&nbsp;3 Squadron RAAF]] during the [[North African campaign|North African Campaign]], where his leadership and fighting skills earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar]]. Subsequently posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Theatre]], he served with the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]], and took part in the "[[Morotai Mutiny]]" of April 1945. After the war he spent many years in [[New Guinea]], developing local industry, for which he was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2004. He died in April 2007, at the age of 90.

==Early career==
Born in [[Young, New South Wales|Young]], a rural community in New South Wales, Gibbes came from an old colonial family. His great-grandfather, [[Colonel]] John George Nathaniel Gibbes, built his residence "Wotonga" at [[Kirribilli, New South Wales|Kirribilli]]; the property was later refurbished to become Sydney's [[Admiralty House, Sydney|Admiralty House]]. Gibbes' grandfather, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, owned [[Yarralumla]] station, now the official residence of Australia's [[Governor-General]]. His father, Henry Edmund Gibbes, was a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazier]]. Gibbes attended [[All Saints College, Bathurst|All Saints College]] in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and became a [[stockman|jackaroo]] after leaving school.<ref>{{cite web | last=Dulhunty|first=Beryl|date = 1959 | title = The Dulhunty Papers: Chronicle of a Family| url=http://www.dulhunty.com/html/Dpc11.htm| accessdate = 20 October 2007 |dateformat = dmy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Humpherson |first=Andrew|date =  3 June 2004 | title = Tribute to Mr Bobby Gibbes| work= Hansard & Papers | publisher=Parliament of NSW |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/5f584b237987507aca256d09008051f3/c1bf5c8d8059c852ca256eb300362429!OpenDocument| accessdate = 20 October 2007 |dateformat = dmy}}</ref>

==Combat service==
===North Africa===
Posted to [[North Africa]] in May 1941, Gibbes briefly joined [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;450 Squadron]] before transferring to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]]. In July, shortly after converting from [[Hawker Hurricane]]s to [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Tomahawk]]s, the squadron took part in the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]]. Gibbes claimed his first victory, a [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] [[Dewoitine D.520]] fighter, on 11&nbsp;June. He had a particularly successful day on 25&nbsp;November, when he shot down two [[Fiat G.50]]s and damaged three more. No.&nbsp;3 Squadron then returned to the [[North African Campaign]], where its Tomahawks were replaced by Kittyhawks. Gibbes took charge of the squadron in February 1942, eventually becoming its longest-serving wartime Commanding Officer (CO).<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="SMH"/><ref name="Times">{{cite news|date=1 May 2007|title=Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1728384.ece|publisher=TimesOnline|accessdate=26 October 2007 | location=London }}</ref> He was leading an attack on a heavily escorted force of German bombers near [[Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base|El Adem]] on 26&nbsp;May when, having probably destroyed a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], he was hit by fire from a [[Junkers Ju 88]] and had to bail out.

Gibbes was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 28&nbsp;July 1942 for his actions on 26&nbsp;May, the citation noting his "exceptional skill and gallantry".<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35646|date=28 July 1942|startpage=3302|supp=yes|accessdate=16 November 2008}}</ref> He claimed No. 3 Squadron's 200th victim on 6 November.<ref>Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', p.43</ref>  On 21&nbsp;December, Gibbes landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down, throwing out his own [[parachute]] to make room in the [[cockpit]] for his passenger.

{{cquote|Man becomes animal when he thinks he is about to die. As you fly back to your base, now safe at last, a feeling of light-hearted exuberance comes over you. It is wonderful to still be alive and it is, I think, merely the after-effect of violent, terrible fear.}}

Returning to Australia, he became Chief Flying Instructor at [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]], [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]], in January 1944.<ref name="AWM"/><ref>[http://www.raafawa.org.au/branches/other/mildura_branch2.htm No.&nbsp;2 OTU Air Museum Mildura] at Royal Australian Air Force Association Website.

In April 1945, now a temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] and stationed at [[No. 80 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;80 Wing]] Headquarters of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (1TAF) in the [[Dutch East Indies]], Gibbes took part in the "[[Morotai Mutiny]]". He was one of eight senior pilots, including Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions.<ref name="Stephens">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.123<U+2013>124</ref><ref>Odgers,  [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.443<U+2013>445]</ref> Gibbes later declared that "...&nbsp;after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." As a former jackaroo, one sortie that involved attacking cattle especially upset him: "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy&nbsp;...&nbsp;at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No--not the Japs. Cattle&nbsp;...&nbsp;If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon&nbsp;...&nbsp;God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else.

However, Gibbes and Caldwell were later court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai.<ref name="Telegraph"/><ref name="Stephens"/> Both were reduced to the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]]; the [[Air Officer Commanding]] 1TAF, Air Commodore [[Harry Cobby]], himself shortly to be dismissed over the incident, subsequently restored Gibbes to Squadron Leader.<ref>Watson, ''Killer Caldwell'', pp.219<U+2013>239</ref>
