'''Salo''' ({{lang-ru/uk|<U+0441><U+0430><U+0301><U+043B><U+043E>}}, {{lang-be|<U+0441><U+0430><U+0301><U+043B><U+0430>}}, {{lang-hu|szalonna}} {{lang-pl|s<U+0142>onina}}, {{lang-bg|<U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> (''slanina'') or less often <U+0441><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E> (''salo'')}}, {{lang-mk|<U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> (''slanina'')}}, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''sl<U+0103>n<U+00ED>n<U+0103>'' or ''sl<U+00E1>n<U+0103>'', [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''slanina'') is a traditional [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an food: slabs of [[pork]] [[Adipose tissue|underskin fat]], with or without skin. As a trend, the Eastern European one is [[edible salt |salted]] or brine fermented, hence the names ''slonina/slana/szalonna'' (''solon<U+00FD>na'' in Ukrainian and ''solonina'' in Russian mean any kind of [[curing |salt-cured]] meat, such as [[corned beef]]). The Central European one is usually treated with paprika or other condiments, while the South European one is often smoked.

It is often mistranslated to English as "[[bacon]]" or "[[lard]]".  Unlike lard, salo is [[Rendering (food processing)|non-rendered]] pork fat. Unlike bacon, salo has little or no [[meat]] (however low-meat high-fat bacon is also commonly referred to as ''salo'').

== Preservation ==
For preservation, salo is salted, sometimes also smoked and aged in a dark and cold place, where it will last for a year or more. For flavouring and better preservation salo may be cured, or covered with a thick layer of [[paprika]], or sometimes [[black pepper]]. Usually the underbelly fat is not used for salting. The slabs of fat are cut into manageable pieces, typically 15<U+00D7>20 cm, and smeared with salt. The slabs are placed skin-down into a wooden box or barrel, alternating with one-centimetre layers of salt. 

When salo has been aged too long, or exposed to light, the fat may become oxidized on the surface and become yellowed and bitter-tasting. Then it can be used as a water-repellent treatment for leather boots or as a bait for [[mouse trap]]s.

== Culinary ==

Salo may be consumed raw, but can also be cooked or fried or finely chopped with garlic as a condiment for [[borscht]] (beet soup). Small pieces of salo are added to some types of [[sausage]]. Thinly-sliced salo on [[rye bread]] rubbed with [[garlic]] is a traditional snack to accompany [[vodka]] in Russia, or [[horilka]] in Ukraine. 

Salo is often chopped into small pieces and fried to render the fat [[cooking fat |for use in cooking]], while the remaining [[crackling]]s ({{lang|uk|''shkvarky''}} in Ukrainian) are used as condiments for fried [[potatoes]] or [[varenyky]].

The thick pork skin that remains after using the salo's fat can also contribute to the stock for soup or [[borscht]]. After boiling it is discarded.

== Salo in popular culture ==
In Eastern-European [[humour]], salo is a stereotypical attribute of [[Ukrainian culture]], analogous to vodka in Russian. In jokes salo is often represented as the highest object of desire for the stereotypical Ukrainian. 

:A Ukrainian tourist is questioned at international [[customs]]:
:<U+2014>Are you carrying any weapons or drugs? 
:<U+2014>Yes, salo. 
:<U+2014>But salo is not a drug.
:<U+2014>When I eat salo, I get [[high]]!

Russian writer [[Vladimir Sorokin]] wrote a scandalous book, ''Blue Salo'' (a pun with the expression "[[blue blood]]").

===Salo in Chocolate===

The expression "chocolate-coated salo" ({{lang|uk|''salo v shokoladi''}}), originating in an [[ethnic joke]] about [[Ukrainians]], has become [[clich<U+00E9>]] among Eastern Slavs, referring to an eclectic mix of tastes or desires. In the early 1990s, the joke became reality at an unorthodox, art-oriented restaurant "Lyal'ka" in [[Lviv]], which made the dish an exclusive, expensive novelty. The BBC reported it among the World's Most Unhealthy Foods [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/misc/unhealthyfoods_20040621.shtml], failing to report its humorous irony.

In the 2000s, [[Odessa]] Confectionery Factory started production of candies {{lang|ru|''Salo v Shokolade''}} [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3825221.stm], [http://www.itar-tass.com/level2.html?NewsID=2867823&PageNum=0], [http://www.sostav.ru/news/2004/04/01/22/]. Popular singer [[Ruslana]] is a fan of this treat. The chocolate candies were invented as an [[April Fool's Day]] joke (Odessa being the de facto humour capital of the former Soviet Union).  They are not actually ''salo''; they contain a regular [[caramel]] filling with a small amount of rendered fat added as a salty flavouring.
