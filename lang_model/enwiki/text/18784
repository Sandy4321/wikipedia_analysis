'''Interstate 691''' (abbreviated '''I-691''') is a portion of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in [[Connecticut]] beginning at [[Interstate 91]] in [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] and ending at [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] near the [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]]-[[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]] town line. It is 8.92 miles in length, including 0.54 miles of the exit ramp to the merge with westbound I-84.

I-691 is also known as the '''[[Henry D. Altobello]] Highway''' for its entire length.

==Route description==
I-691 is the main east-west highway of the city of [[Meriden (CT)|Meriden]]. The freeway actually begins in Middlefield as [[Route 66 (Connecticut)|Route 66]], technically becoming I-691 at the junction with [[I-91]] (Exit 11). However, westbound signage indicates I-691 begins at the start of the freeway (just west of Exit 13), while eastbound signage shows I-691 ending at the [[Route 15 (Connecticut)|Route 15]] interchange (at eastbound Exit 10 about 0.5 miles west of the interchange with I-91). To go from I-91 northbound to I-691 westbound (or from I-691 eastbound to I-91 southbound), one must actually use Route 15.

==History==
[[Image:US 6A.svg|90px|right]]
In the 1940s, the I-691 routing was part of a planned US 6A Expressway from Southington to Willimantic. A section of the expressway (from its Middlefield terminus west to Exit 8) first opened in 1966. By 1968, the US 6A designation was dropped in favor of [[Connecticut Route 66|Route 66]]. The highway was extended west to Exit 4 by 1971. The connection to I-84 was eventually completed in 1987, with the renumbering to I-691 done at the same time. The portion east of I-91 remained as Route 66.
