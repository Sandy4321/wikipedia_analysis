{{nihongo|'''''The Great Yokai War''''' |<U+5996><U+602A><U+5927><U+6226><U+4E89>|Y<U+014D>kai daisens<U+014D>}} is a [[2005 in film|2005]] [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] [[children's film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and produced by [[Kadokawa Pictures]]. In the 2005 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and on its June 30, 2006, [[United States|American]] premiere, in [[New York City]], it was released under the international English title ''The Great Yokai War'' by [[Media Blasters|Tokyo Shock]].

The Toronto festival site defines ''[[Yokai]]'' as "bizarre-looking monsters and supernatural beings from [[Japanese folklore]] who like to play tricks on unsuspecting humans". ''Daisens<U+014D>'' literally means "great war".

It borrows the title of a 1968 film, which was released in the US by [[ADV Films]] as ''[[Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare]]'', part of the ''[[Yokai Monsters]]'' series and directed by [[Yoshiyuki Kuroda]]. The only common element shared by the 1968 and 2005 films is the concept of a yokai war: for example, the original is a period piece about a Babylonian demon that migrates to Japan, where it is opposed by the local spirits; the new version is set in contemporary times, and the villain is a a spirit of refuse / waste. Whereas the original used [[tokusatsu]] [[special effects]], the 2005 version makes heavy use of [[stop-motion]] puppet animation and CGI.

==Plot==
A young boy moves to a small town after the divorce of his parents. At a local festival, he is picked to be that year's "[[Kirin]] Rider," a protector of all things good. He soon discovers that his new title is quite literal, as a nefarious spirit of waste begins to wage war with the local yokai and human populations.
