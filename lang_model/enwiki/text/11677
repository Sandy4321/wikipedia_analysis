'''Brahan Castle''' was situated {{convert|3.5|mi}} south-west of [[Dingwall]], in [[Easter Ross]], [[Scotland]]. The castle belonged to the [[Earl of Seaforth|Earls of Seaforth]], chiefs of the [[Clan Mackenzie]], who dominated the area.

==History==
Brahan Castle was built by [[Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth]] in 1611.<ref name=rcahms>{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/12867/details/brahan+castle/ |title=Brahan Castle |work=[[CANMORE]] |publisher=[[RCAHMS]] |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> Kenneth Mackenzie, a labourer on the estate, was a reputed seer who made a number of [[prophecy|prophecies]] in the later 17th century. He is remembered as the [[Brahan Seer]]. 

The Mackenzies were prominent [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], and took part in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715, 1719 and 1745. The [[Siege of Brahan]] took place in November 1715.<ref>Mackenzie, Alexander. "History of the Munros of Fowlis". page 99 Published 1898. Quoting a contemporary manuscript written by Major Fraser of Castleleathers</ref> [[William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth]], was [[attaint]]ed, forfeiting the estate, which in 1725 became the headquarters of [[General Wade]] during his "pacification" of the Highlands.<ref name=HS>{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/gardens/gardenssearchmoreinfo.htm?s=brahan&r=&bool=1&PageID=2288&more_info=Site |title=Brahan Castle: Site history |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |work=An Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> After a later Jacobite rising of 1745, the Mackenzies were the first clan to surrender, being forced to swear allegiance to the British Crown on the steps of the castle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clan-mackenzie.org.uk/clan/brahan.html |title=Brahan Castle |publisher=Clan Mackenzie Society of Scotland and the UK |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>

The estate was later sold back to the Mackenzie family, although the direct line of descent died out in 1781. The estate passed to [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth]] who carried out tree planting in the grounds. On his death without heir in 1815 Brahan passed to the Stewart-Mackenzies.<ref name=HS/> During the first half of the 19th century, the castle was rebuilt and extended as a large [[country house]].<ref name=rcahms/> 

[[James Stewart-Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|James Stewart-Mackenzie]] was created [[Baron Seaforth]] in 1921, but on his death without heir in 1923, he left the estate to a trust.<ref name=HS/> Brahan Castle was briefly [[requisitioned]] during [[World War II]], and after the war its condition deteriorated. In the early 1950s the building was demolished, leaving only the north wall of the 19th century building, which served as a garden ornament. The stable block survives, and is now known as Brahan House. Several heraldic panels and other decorative stones are preserved in the house.<ref name=rcahms/>

A monument on the estate, around {{convert|1|mi}} west of the site of the castle, commemorates the death in 1823 of Caroline Mackenzie, daughter of the last earl, who died after being thrown from a pony carriage near the same location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=14027 |title=Seaforth Monument, Listed Building Report |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>
