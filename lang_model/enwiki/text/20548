==Reception==
The [[Allmusic]] review by Ron Wynn awarded the album 4<U+00BD> stars stating "Although he cannot maintain the same nonstop pace he had in the early '60s, Jackie McLean still plays magnificently. He demonstrated that repeatedly on this 1986 duo date with pianist Mal Waldron, whose lovely [[countermelodies]], complementary solos, darting phrases, and supporting accompaniment proved a perfect contrast to McLean's forays. He is lyrical and engaging on some tracks; his explosive side emerges on others".<ref name="Allmusic">Wynn, R.
