The name is first recorded in 848 as ''Grenan forda''. It is formed from the [[Old English]] 'gr<U+0113>ne' and 'ford' and means 'place at the green ford'. Greenford was known as '''Great Greenford''' to distinguish it from [[Perivale|Little Greenford]], which is now known as Perivale. The affixes 'Magma' and 'Muche' have also been used to denote the difference.<ref name=mills>{{ cite book | surname=Mills | first=D. | title=Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names | year=2000 | publisher=Oxford}}</ref>
