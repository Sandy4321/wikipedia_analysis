The '''Puerto Rico National [[Baseball]] Team''' ([[Spanish language|spanish:]] ''Selecci<U+00F3>n de b<U+00E9>isbol de Puerto Rico''; also known as the "Puerto Rico National Baseball Selection" or "Puerto Rican National Baseball Selection") is a team that is selected by the Puerto Rican Baseball Federation to compete in major international events in representation of [[Puerto Rico#Sports|Puerto Rico]].

The team is usually ensembled with thirty players from the [[Professional Baseball League of Puerto Rico]] and [[Major League Baseball]]. The team has participated in many international competitions, such as the [[Caribbean World Series]], the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]], the [[Pan American Games]] and others. They are currently the 10th ranked [[baseball]] team in the world.{{IBAF World Rankings ref/2010 June}} Puerto Rico was an inaugural member of the [[World Baseball Classic]], making its debut in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|first edition]]. The team has advanced to the second round in all of its appearances, in the process becoming the first team to score [[mercy rule]] wins over [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuba]] and the [[United States national baseball team|United States]].

In the [[2013 World Baseball Classic]], Puerto Rico became the second team from [[Western Hemisphere]] to advance to the final, and the first team to defeat two-time world champion [[Japan national baseball team|Japan]] in the semifinals.

==History==

===Baseball===
Puerto Rico made its debut at the [[Baseball World Cup]], then known as the "Amateur World Series" in 1940, only two years after the creation of the [[Liga de B<U+00E9>isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] (LBPPR), which at the moment was an amateur league. Like all of the other expansion teams, they finished in the bottom half of the table, tied with Mexico with a record of 2-10. The following year the team repeated thus performance, finishing tied with El Salvador. Between 1942 and 1943, Puerto Rico did not participate due to the ongoing World War II to which several LBPPR players were drafted. The team returned in 1944, but finished tied with Nicaragua with arecord of 1-6. Puerto Rico declined participation in the 1945 Amateur World Series, joining Mexico and Cuba in absence.

===World Championship===
As the LBPPR expanded and became more organized, the quality of players compossing the Puerto Rican national team improved. Returning in 1947, Puerto Rico won the silver medal, having entered the round robin tied with a record of 6-2, defeating Nicaragua to advance before losing to the host, Colombia, in the finals. Puerto Rico went 6-1 in the round-robin but lost 11-1 and 2-1 to the Dominicans in the best-of-3 finals. They won their second straight Silver Medal. M. Ruiz tied for the most doubles (4) and most triples (2). In 1950, the team finished the regular phase of the tournament tied with the Dominican Republic and Cubs for the first place with a record of 9-2, the team defeated Cuba and lost to the Dominican Republic during the round robin phase. However, the Federaci<U+00F3>n Internacional de B<U+00E9>isbol Aficionado (FIBA) ruled that several players that had joined the team were ineligie to play, ruling several key victories "forfeits" and dropping it out of the podium. This inicident was the result of the LBPPR from amateur to professional a few years earlier.

In 1951, Puerto Rico earned a record of 7-3 in the regular stage, handing Cuba its only defeat in the first games. After advancing, the team went undefeated with wins over Cuba and Venezuela to secure the gold medal. The team was headlined by Sotero Ortiz who scored more runs (21) and stole more bases (10) than anyone else, while teammate Ramon Maldonado hit 8 doubles to lead the stadistic. In 1952, Puerto Rico went 7-3, including 2-2 in the final round to take bronze medal. They were the only team to beat Cuba in the finals. W. Figueredo led in triples (3) while J.R. Garcia led in homers (2) and steals (7). Sotero Ortiz tied for the most doubles (4) and runs (13). Due to the improving quality of its players, Puerto Rico soon began experiencing the loss of its best players to the professional leagues at a very young age, including [[Roberto Clemente]] and [[Orlando Cepeda]]. In 1953, the team finished 6th with a record of 5-5. However, F<U+00E9>lix Torres drove in 15 runs to lead the Series.

By the time that the series resumed in 1963, [[Major League Baseball]] had become the primary employer of Puerto Rican talent, making them ineligible to play in the Amateur World Series and the team did not participate in this edition. Back for the tournament in 1965, Puerto Rico won Bronze with a 5-3 record. Andres Cruz led the Series in average (.485), hits (16) and RBI (8). Pitcher Efrain Contreras set an Amateur World Series record by striking out 19 against the Netherlands Antilles. After another hiatus of four years, the event resumed in 1969, which saw Panama, Puerto Rico, Colombia and Nicaragua all tied for 5th with 4-6 records. Luis Mercado led the tournament in doubles (6) and tied for the most triples (3). In 1970, Puerto Rico won the bronze medal with a record of 9-2. Ram<U+00F3>n Ortiz hit the most home runs (3) in the competition.

===FIBA vs. FEMBA; unique dual medallist===
In 1971, Puerto Rico finished tied with Nicaragua in the third place with a record of 6-3, but did not receive the bronze medal due to their individual series. Carlos Lowell led all pitchers with 3 wins. In 1972, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Chinese Taipei tied for 6th, all with 9-6 marks. The team was managed by Roberto Clemente (only weeks prior to his death) and featured a no-hitter by Sandalio Quinonez against Costa Rica. In 1973, Puerto Rico participated in two versions of the Amateur World Series due to internal conflicts in the sport, in the Federaci<U+00F3>n Internacional de B<U+00E9>isbol Aficionado version, the team won won the silver medal with a record of 10-3, with two of those loses coming at the hands of eventual winner, Cuba. J. Fontanez led in average (.432). The team was managed by Vic Power. A splinter cell of the national team won the bronze at the event's Federaci<U+00F3>n Mundial de B<U+00E9>isbol Amateur version with a record of 8-2. Puerto Rico is the only participant to win medals in both of the 1973 events. Eventually the FIBA and FEMBA merged and the event had only one sanctioning body, the [[International Amateur Baseball Association]]. In 1974, Puerto Rico finished tied for fourth place at the Amateur World Series along Canada, Italy, Chinese Taipei and the Dominican Republic. In the 1976 World Amateur Series, Puerto Rico won Silver with a 8-2 round-robin before leaving the tournament prior to the final round. J.L. de Leon led the tournament with a 0.00 ERA. After missing the 1978 edition of the World Amateur Series, the team came back in 1980, but finished tied in the 7th place with Venezuela with a 4-7 record. After missing out another version of the Amateur World Series, the team returned in 1984, finishing behind Panama with a record of 6-7, despite gathering a 54-46 advantage in runs. Mariano Quinones (2-0, 2.48) was their most effective pitcher. The top hitter was 1B Luis Fontanez (.353/.400/.569). Future MLB player Hector Villanueva was part of the roster, but had an unsuccessful tournament going 2 for 13 with a double and no walks. In the 1986 Amateur World Series, Puerto Rico tied for 7th at 5-6, despite outscoring opponents 56-45. Roberto Santana (.369) led the Series with 6 stolen bases. Eddie Rodriguez (1.28) had two saves. By 1988, the Amateur World Series became known as the Baseball World Cup and Puerto Rico beat both #3 Taiwan and #4 Japan and lost to #1 Cuba by just one run. However, losses to Canada, Nicaragua and South Korea kept the team out of the final four. CF <U+00C1>ngel Morales (.395/.490/.737, 14 R, 14 RBI) and DH Helson Rodriguez (.300/.462/.650) guided the offensive charge. Victor L. Martinez was 0-1 with a 1.80 ERA, the lowest on the staff.

===Migration of MLB All-Stars and fallout===
Beginning during the last years of the 1980s and extending throughout the 1990s, Puerto Rico saw a major increase in its production of high-caliber players, with a crop that included [[Iv<U+00E1>n Rodr<U+00ED>guez]], [[Roberto Alomar]], [[Bernie Williams]], [[Rub<U+00E9>n Sierra]], [[Jorge Posada]], [[Juan Gonz<U+00E1>lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz<U+00E1>lez]], [[Carlos Delgado]], [[Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez]] and [[Carlos Beltr<U+00E1>n]] among several others. This fact severely limited the quantity of talent available for the national baseball team, due to the protective behaviour exhibited by the MLB teams that signed these players since their teenage years. In the 1990 Baseball World Cup, Puerto Rico went 7-2 but finished 4th thanks to the format. They were 4th with 52 runs and second in ERA (2.89). 1B Efrain Garcia (.351/.385/.568, 7 RBI), All-Star CF <U+00C1>ngel Morales (.417/.463/.556, 8 R, 10 RBI) and DH Helson Rodriguez (.371/.385/.714, 3 HR, 11 RBI) paced the offense. Headlining a fine staff was Jesus I. Feliciano (1-0, 0.56). In 1994, Puerto Rico finished with a 3-4 record, with two close one-run losses (3-2 to Panama and 4-3 to the Netherlands). They hit .305 as a team, fifth in that tournament. Top performers were 1B Efrain Garcia (.448/.484/.724, 8 RBI in 7 games), C Jose Lorenzana (.400/.455/.500), RF Joel Perez (.318/.348/.682) and P Nelson Sanchez (1-1, 2.25). After being absent from two World Cups, the team returned in 2005 but Puerto Rico Puerto Rico, managed by Bert Pe<U+00F1>a, went 6-5 despite being outscored overall, 60-56. They finished 8th overall. Randy Ruiz (.346/.452/.654), CF Jesus Feliciano (.378/.410/.649, 10 R, 9 RBI) and Edwards Guzman (.343/.375/.543) led the offense However, former MLB player Angel Echevarria had a weak performance with averages of .083/.241/.125. Orlando Rom<U+00E1>n (2-0, 0.50) was their clear top starter as 4 pitchers had ERAs over 8.
