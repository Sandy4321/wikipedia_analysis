[[Image:Westminster abbey west.jpg|thumb|right|British [[coronation]]s are held in [[Westminster Abbey]].]]

The '''Coronation of the British Monarch''' is a [[ceremony]] (specifically, [[initiation rite]]) in which the [[monarch]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s is formally [[Crown (headgear)|crowned]] and invested with [[regalia]]. It corresponds to the coronation ceremonies that formerly occurred in other European monarchies; all have abandoned coronations in favour of [[inauguration]]s.

The [[coronation]] usually takes place several months after the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate when [[mourning]] still continues. This also gives planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] was crowned on 2&nbsp;June 1953, despite having acceded to the throne on 6&nbsp;February 1952, the instant her father died. British law states that the throne is not left [[Demise of the Crown|vacant]] and the new monarch succeeds the old immediately.

The ceremony is performed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the most senior cleric of the [[Church of England]]. Other clergy and members of the nobility also have roles; most participants in the ceremony are required to wear ceremonial uniforms or robes. Many other government officials and guests attend, including representatives of foreign countries.

The essential elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold the law and the Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with oil, crowned, and invested with the regalia, before receiving the [[homage]] of his or her subjects.

== History ==

The timing of the coronation has varied throughout British history. The first [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] monarch, [[William I of England|William I]], was crowned on the day he became King<U+2014>25&nbsp;December 1066.<ref>Bates, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] was fighting in the [[Ninth Crusade]] when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274.<ref>Prestwick, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in [[Scotland]] in 1307.<ref>Phillips, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437.<ref name="henry-vi">Griffiths, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Under the Hanoverian monarchs in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was deemed appropriate to extend the waiting period to several months, following a period of mourning for the previous monarch and to allow time for preparation of the ceremony.<ref name="royal.gov-coronation"/> 
In the case of every monarch since, and including, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], at least one year has passed between accession and coronation, with the exception of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], whose [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|predecessor]] did not die but [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]].<ref name="uk-monarchs-list">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title = Monarchs of Great Britain and the United Kingdom (1707<U+2013>2003) | year = 2004 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/92648 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}</ref> The Coronation date had already been set; planning simply continued with a new monarch.<ref>Matthew, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

Since a period of time has often passed between accession and coronation, some monarchs were never crowned. [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] and [[Jane of England|Lady Jane Grey]] were both deposed before they could be crowned, in 1483 and 1553, respectively.<ref name="england-monarchs-list">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title = Monarchs of England (924x7<U+2013>1707) | year = 2004 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/92701 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}</ref> [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] also went uncrowned, as he abdicated in 1936 before the end of the customary one-year period between accession and coronation.<ref name="uk-monarchs-list"/> Under British law, however, a monarch accedes to the throne the moment their predecessor dies, not when they are crowned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4945.asp |title=Accession |work=Ceremony and Symbol |author=Royal Household |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>

The [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs used various locations for their coronations, including [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[London]], and [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]]. The last Anglo-Saxon monarch, [[Harold II of England|Harold II]], was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1066; the location was preserved for all future coronations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/anglosaxon/01_coron.php|title=England: Anglo-Saxon Consecrations: 871-1066|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> The basic elements of the coronation ceremony have also remained the same for the last thousand years; it was devised in 973 by [[Dunstan]].<ref>Churchill, Winston (1966). [[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples|The Birth of Britain]] p.134. Dodd, Mead.</ref><ref name="royal.gov-coronation"/> When London was under the control of the French,<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', p72</ref> [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] was crowned at [[Gloucester]] in 1216; he later chose to have a second coronation at Westminster in 1220.<ref>Ridgeway, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Two hundred years later, Henry VI also had two coronations; as King of England in London in 1429, and as [[King of France]] in Paris in 1431.<ref name="henry-vi"/>

Following the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as [[Lord Protector]] in 1657.<ref>Morrill, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

Coronations may be performed for a person other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, [[Henry the Young King]], heir to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father [[Henry II of England|Henry II]];<ref>Keefe, Thomas K., ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this is only one of two instances of its kind in England (the other being that of [[Ecgfrith of Mercia]] in 796, crowned whilst his father, [[Offa of Mercia]], was still alive).<ref>{{citation|last=Spigelman|first=J.J.|authorlink=Jim Spigelman|chapter=Becket and Henry II: Exile|title=Fourth Address in the Becket Lecture Series to the St Thomas More Society, Sydney|date=8 October 2002|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/pages/SCO_speech_spigelman_081002|publisher=Supreme Court of New South Wales|location=Sydney|accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as [[queen consort]], though the husband of a [[queen regnant]] is never crowned. If the king is already married at the time of his coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may be performed.<ref name="royal.gov-coronation"/> The first such coronation was of [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', pp xxx<U+2013>xxxi, although the dates of the coronations of three queens are unknown</ref> The most recent was that of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and the former [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a Queen consort in England was that of [[Matilda of Flanders]] in 1068;<ref>van Houts, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> the last was [[Anne Boleyn]]'s in 1533.<ref>Strong, pp xxx<U+2013>xxxi</ref> The most recent King to wed post-Coronation, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], did not have a separate coronation for his bride.<ref>Woolley, ''Coronation Rites'', p199</ref>

Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 was [[Television|televised]] by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]. Originally only events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the main events of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live. This led to controversy in the press, and even questions in Parliament.<ref>See for example, ''The Times'', 29 October 1952, p4</ref> The decision was subsequently altered, and the entire ceremony televised, with the exception of the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the previous coronation. It was not revealed until 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the Queen. It is estimated that over twenty million individuals viewed the programme in the United Kingdom, an audience unprecedented in television history. The coronation greatly increased public interest in televisions.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', p433<U+2013>435</ref>

The monarch is simultaneously crowned as sovereign of multiple nations; Elizabeth II was asked, for example: "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?"<ref name="oremus">{{cite web| url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html |title=The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in The Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953 |author=Kershaw, Simon |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref>

== Participants ==

Attendees include foreign and Commonwealth dignitaries as well as Britons, some of whom will participate in the ceremony directly. For Elizabeth II's Coronation in 1953, 7,500 guests were squeezed into the Abbey and each person had to make do with a maximum of {{convert|18|in|mm}} of seating.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Attendants|author=Yvonne Demoskoff|url=http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~canyon/qecoronation.htm|accessdate=2008-03-11}}</ref>

=== Clergy ===

The Archbishop of Canterbury, who has precedence over all other clergymen and over all laymen except members of the Royal Family,<ref name="precedence">{{cite web |last = Velde |first = Fran<U+00E7>ois |title = Order of Precedence in England and Wales |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/order_precedence.htm|work=Heraldica|accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref> traditionally officiates at coronations;<ref name="50-facts">{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4455.asp |title=50 facts about the Coronation |work=Buckingham Palace press releases |date=2003-05-23 |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> during his absence, another bishop appointed by the monarch may take his place.<ref name="oath">{{cite web|author=Walker, Aileen; Gay, Oonagh|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-00435.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Coronation Oath|publisher=House of Commons Library|date=30 November 2005|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> There have, however, been several exceptions. William I was crowned by the [[Archbishop of York]], since the Archbishop of Canterbury had been appointed by the [[Antipope]] [[Benedict X]], and this appointment was not recognised as valid by the Pope.<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown, Orb & Sceptre'', p16</ref> [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] was crowned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]] because the Archbishop of Canterbury had been exiled by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown, Orb & Sceptre'', p48</ref> [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], a Catholic, refused to be crowned by the Protestant [[Archbishop Cranmer]]; the coronation was instead performed by the Bishop of Winchester.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', p205</ref> Finally, when [[James II of England|James II]] was deposed and replaced with William III and Mary II jointly, the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to recognise the new Sovereigns; he had to be replaced by the [[Bishop of London]].<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', p337</ref> Hence, in almost all cases where the Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to participate, his place has been taken by a senior cleric: the Archbishop of York is second in precedence, the Bishop of London third, the Bishop of Durham fourth, and the Bishop of Winchester fifth.<ref name="precedence"/> [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] was crowned by the [[Bishop of Carlisle]] (to whose [[Episcopal see|see]] is attached no special precedence) because the senior [[prelate]]s considered her birth illegitimate.<ref name="strong-elizabeth">Strong, ''Coronation'', p208</ref>

=== Great Officers of State ===

The [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]] traditionally participate during the ceremony. The offices of [[Lord High Steward]] and [[Lord High Constable]] have not been regularly filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, revived for coronation ceremonies.<ref name="lord-high-steward">Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica (1911), ''Lord High Steward''</ref><ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica (1911), ''Lord High Constable''</ref> The [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] enrobes the Sovereign with the ceremonial vestments, with the aid of the [[Groom of the Robes]] and the [[Master of the Robes|Master]] (in the case of a King) or [[Mistress of the Robes|Mistress]] (in the case of a Queen) of the Robes.<ref name="oremus"/>

The [[Warden of the Cinque Ports|Barons]] of the [[Cinque Ports]] also participated in the ceremony. Formerly, the Barons were the Members of the House of Commons representing the Cinque Ports. Reforms in the nineteenth century, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, Barons were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the Barons were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the Sovereign. The last time the Barons performed such a task was at the coronation of George IV in 1821. The Barons did not return for the coronations of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]. At coronations since Victoria's, the Barons have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.info/collections/themes/costume_gallery/html/cinque_ports.html |title=Barons of the Cinque Ports |work=Coronation of George IV|author=Brighton and Hove Museums| accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

=== Other claims to attend the coronation ===

Many landowners and other persons have honorific "duties" or privileges at the coronation. Such rights are determined by a special [[Court of Claims (United Kingdom)|Court of Claims]], over which the Lord High Steward traditionally presided. The first recorded Court of Claims was convened in 1377 for the coronation of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. By the Tudor period, the hereditary post of Lord High Steward had merged with the Crown, and so [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] began the modern tradition of naming a temporary Steward for the coronation only, with separate commissioners to carry out the actual work of the court.<ref name="lord-high-steward"/>

In 1952, for example, the Court accepted the claim of the [[Dean of Westminster]] to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the [[Bishop of Durham|Lord Bishop of Durham]] and the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells]] to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand on either side of her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury]] in his capacity as [[Lord High Steward of Ireland]] to carry a white staff, and the claim of the Queen's Scholars of [[Westminster School]] to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people (their shouts of "Vivat! Vivat Regina!" were incorporated into an anthem).<ref>Crown Office, ''Minutes of the proceedings of the Court of Claims''</ref>

== Dress ==
=== Sovereign's robes ===

[[Image:Victoria in her Coronation.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Queen Victoria in her Coronation robes and wearing the State Diadem]]
[[Image:Duke of Clarence at George IV's coronation.JPG|thumb|right|The robes of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|HRH The Duke of Clarence]], a Royal Duke (later William IV), included a train borne by a page.]]

The Sovereign wears a variety of different robes and other garments during the course of the ceremony:

* ''Crimson surcoat'' <U+2013> the regular dress during most of the ceremony, worn under all other robes. In 1953, Elizabeth II wore a newly made gown in place of a surcoat.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes">{{cite journal| url=http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Sovereigns_Coronation_Robes.htm|author=Cox, N. |year=1999 |title=The Coronation Robes of the Sovereign|journal=Arma |volume=5|issue=1|pages=271<U+2013>280}}</ref>
* ''Robe of State of crimson velvet'' or ''Parliament Robe'' <U+2013> the first robe used at a coronation, worn on entry to the Abbey and later at [[State Opening of Parliament|State Openings of Parliament]]. It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined with further ermine and decorated with gold lace.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Anointing gown'' <U+2013> a simple and austere garment worn during the anointing. It is plain white, bears no decoration and fastens at the back.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Colobium sindonis'' ("shroud tunic") <U+2013> the first robe with which the Sovereign is invested. It is a loose white undergarment of fine linen cloth edged with a lace border, open at the sides, sleeveless and cut low at the neck. It symbolises the derivation of Royal authority from the people.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Supertunica'' <U+2013> the second robe with which the Sovereign is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Robe Royal'' or ''Pallium Regale'' <U+2013> the main robe worn during the ceremony and used during the Crowning.<ref name="oremus"/> It is a four-square mantle, lined in crimson silk and decorated with silver coronets, national symbols and silver imperial eagles in the four corners. It is lay, rather than liturgical, in nature.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Stole Royal'' or ''armilla'' <U+2013> a gold silk scarf which accompanies the Robe Royal, richly and heavily embroidered with gold and silver thread, set with jewels and lined with rose-coloured silk and gold fringing.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Purple surcoat'' <U+2013> the counterpart to the crimson surcoat, worn during the final part of the ceremony.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>
* ''Imperial Robe of purple velvet'' <U+2013> the robe worn at the conclusion of the ceremony, on exit from the Abbey. It comprises an embroidered ermine cape with a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian ermine and fully lined with pure silk English satin. The purple recalls the imperial robes of [[Roman Emperor]]s.<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/>

In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Regalia]], it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch. The present exceptions are the ''supertunica'' and ''Robe Royal'', which both date from the Coronation of George IV in 1821.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Tessa|year=1992|title=The Coronation Ceremony of the Kings and Queens of England and the Crown Jewels|location=London|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0-11-701361-7|page=100}}</ref>

=== Official costume ===
[[Image:Earl coronation robes.jpg|thumb|right|An earl's coronation robes]]
Several participants in the ceremony wear special costumes, uniforms or robes. Peers' robes comprise a full-length crimson velvet coat, and an ermine cape. Rows of sealskin spots on the cape designate the peer's rank; dukes use four rows, marquesses three and a half, earls three, viscounts two and a half, and barons and lords of Parliament two. Royal dukes use six rows of ermine, ermine on the front of the cape and long trains borne by pages. Peeresses' ranks are designated not by sealskin spots, but by the length of their trains and the width of the ermine edging on the same. For duchesses, the trains are two yards (2&nbsp;m) long, for marchionesses one and three-quarters yards, for countesses one and a half yards, for viscountesses one and a quarter yards, and for baronesses and ladies one yard (1&nbsp;m). The ermine edgings are five inches (127&nbsp;mm) in width for duchesses, four inches (102&nbsp;mm) for marchionesses, three inches (76&nbsp;mm) for countesses, and two inches for viscountesses, baronesses and ladies. The robes of peers and peeresses are used only during coronations.<ref name="cox-peers-robes">{{cite journal|url=http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Peers_Robes.htm |author=Cox, N | year=1999 |title=The Coronation and Parliamentary Robes of the British Peerage |journal=Arma |volume=5 |issue=1|pages=289<U+2013>293}}</ref>

=== Crowns and coronets ===

Peers wear [[coronets]], as do most members of the Royal Family; such coronets display heraldic emblems based on rank or association to the monarch. The heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-patt<U+00E9>e alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used for the children and siblings of Sovereigns. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-patt<U+00E9>e and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-patt<U+00E9>e and four strawberry leaves, is used for the children of the sons and brothers of Sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne instead of any coronets based on peerage dignities. The coronets of dukes show eight strawberry leaves, those of marquesses four strawberry leaves alternating with four raised silver balls, those of earls eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight raised silver balls, those of viscounts sixteen silver balls and those of barons six silver balls. Peeresses use the same design, except that they appear on smaller circlets than the peers' coronets.<ref name="cox-coronets">{{cite journal|url=http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/coronets.htm|author=Cox, N |year=1999 |title=The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage|journal=The Double Tressure|volume=22 |pages=8<U+2013>13}}</ref>

Aside from kings and queens, the only individuals authorised to wear crowns (as opposed to coronets) are the [[King of arms|Kings of Arms]], the United Kingdom's senior [[Officer of arms|heraldic officials]].<ref name="chambers">Chambers's Encyclop<U+00E6>dia (1863), ''King of Arms''</ref> [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter]], [[Clarenceaux King of Arms|Clarenceaux]], and [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy and Ulster]] Kings of Arms have heraldic jurisdiction over England, Wales and Northern Ireland;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/06.htm |title=The origin and history of the various heraldic offices |work=About the College of Arms |author=The College of Arms |accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Lord Lyon King of Arms is responsible for Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/215.180.html |title=History of the Court of the Lord Lyon |accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> In addition, there is a King of Arms attached to each of the [[Order of the Bath]], [[Order of St. Michael and St. George]] and the [[Order of the British Empire]]. These have only a ceremonial role, but are authorised by the statutes of their orders to wear the same crown as Garter at a coronation.<ref>See e.g. (Order of the Bath), {{LondonGazette|issue=20737|startpage=1956|date=25 May 1847|accessdate=2007-11-14}} (Order of the British Empire) {{LondonGazette|issue=32781|startpage=9160|date=21 December 1922|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The crown of a King of Arms is silver-gilt and consists of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, and inscribed with the words ''Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam'' (Latin: "Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy").<ref name="chambers"/> The Lord Lyon King of Arms has worn a crown of this style at all coronations since that of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. Prior to that he wore a replica of the Crown of Scotland. In 2004 a new replica of this crown was created for use by the Lord Lyon at future coronations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews-fund.org.uk/?p=3 |title=The Lord Lyon's Crown|author=The St Andrews Fund for Scots Heraldry|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>

=== Other participants ===

Along with persons of nobility, the coronation ceremonies are also attended by a wide range of political figures, including all members of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], all Prime Ministers and [[Governor General|Governors General]] of the [[Commonwealth Realms]], all [[Governor]]s of British [[Crown Colony|Crown Colonies]], as well as the [[Head of State|Heads of State]] of dependent nations.

== Recognition and oath ==<!-- This section is linked from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] -->

[[Image:George IV coronation.jpg|thumb|right|375px|George IV's train was borne by eight eldest sons of peers and by the Master of the Robes. From left to right: The King, [[Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk|Earl of Surrey]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington|Marquess of Douro]], [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury|Viscount Cranborne]], [[George Pratt, 2nd Marquess Camden|Earl of Brecnock]], [[Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]], [[George Cholmondeley, 2nd Marquess of Cholmondeley|Earl of Rocksavage]], [[George Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Rawdon]], [[Henry Chetwynd-Talbot, 18th Earl of Shrewsbury|Viscount Ingestre]] and [[Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham|Lord Francis Conyngham]].]]

The Sovereign enters Westminster Abbey wearing the ''crimson surcoat'' and the ''Robe of State of crimson velvet''.

Once the Sovereign takes his or her seat on the Chair of Estate, the [[Garter King of Arms|Garter Principal King of Arms]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], the [[Lord High Constable]] and the [[Earl Marshal]] go to the east, south, west and north of the Abbey. At each side, the Archbishop calls for the Recognition of the Sovereign, with the words, "Sirs, I here present unto you ..., your undoubted King. Wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?" After the people acclaim the Sovereign at each side, the Archbishop administers an oath to the Sovereign.<ref name="oremus"/> The oath has varied over the years; at Elizabeth II's coronation, the exchange between the Queen and the Archbishop was as follows:

: ''The Archbishop of Canterbury:'' "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[South Africa|Union of South Africa]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?"
: ''The Queen:'' "I solemnly promise so to do."
: ''The Archbishop of Canterbury:'' "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?"
: ''The Queen:'' "I will."
: ''The Archbishop of Canterbury:'' "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel? Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the United Kingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law? Will you maintain and preserve inviolable the settlement of the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in England? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of England, and to the Churches there committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of them?"

The monarch additionally swears an oath to preserve [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church government in the [[Church of Scotland]]. This part of the oath is taken before the coronation.<ref name="oath"/>

Once the taking of the oath concludes, an ecclesiastic presents a [[Bible]] to the Sovereign, saying "Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God."<ref name="oremus"/> The Bible used is a full [[King James Bible]], including the [[Apocrypha]].<ref>{{citation|author=Carefoote, P.J.|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/development/news/halcyon/halcyon_june_2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Coronation Bible|date=June 2006|journal=The Halcyon: the Newsletter of the Friends of the Thomas Fisher Rare Books Library|issn=0840-5565|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> At Elizabeth II's coronation, the Bible was presented by the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Once the Bible is presented, the [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] is celebrated, but the service is interrupted after the [[Nicene Creed]].<ref name="oremus"/>

== Anointing and crowning ==

[[Image:Marquess of Anglesey carrying St Edward's Crown.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|1st Marquess of Anglesey]] carried St Edward's Crown at George IV's coronation.]]

After the Communion service is interrupted, the ''crimson robe'' is removed, and the Sovereign proceeds to [[King Edward's Chair]],<ref name="oremus"/> which has been set in a most prominent position, wearing the ''anointing gown''. (In 1953, King Edward's Chair stood atop a dais of several steps.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/royalty/coronations/coronation-elizabeth-2/?article-images-selected-id=25176#images |title=Coronation of the British Monarch |publisher=Westminster Abbey |accessdate=2007-10-01}}, Image of 'Completed Coronation Theatre' at bottom.</ref> This ancient mediaeval chair has a slot in the base into which the [[Stone of Scone]] is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as the "stone of destiny", it was used for ancient Scottish coronations until brought to England by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. It has been used for every coronation at Westminster Abbey since. Until 1996 the stone was kept with the chair in Westminster Abbey between coronations; but it was returned that year to Scotland, where it will remain on display in [[Edinburgh Castle]] until it is needed for a coronation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/royalty/coronations/coronation-chair/ |title=Coronation Chair|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

Once seated in this chair, a [[Baldachin|canopy]] is held over the monarch's head for the [[anointing]]. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was performed in recent coronations by four [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]].<ref name="oremus"/> This element of the coronation service is considered sacred and is concealed from public gaze;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/34/50/coronation50th.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Coronation: An Intimate Ritual|publisher=The Anglican Communion|date=2 June 2003|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> it was not photographed in 1937 or televised in 1953. The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a spoon; the Archbishop of Canterbury then anoints the Sovereign on the hands, breast, and head.<ref name="oremus"/> The [[filigree]]d spoon is the only part of the mediaeval crown jewels which survived the [[Commonwealth of England|commonwealth]].<ref name="crown-jewels"/> The Archbishop concludes by stating a blessing.<ref name="oremus"/>

The Sovereign is then enrobed in the ''colobium sindonis'', over which is placed the ''supertunica''.<ref name="oremus"/>

The Lord Great Chamberlain presents the [[spur]]s,<ref name="oremus"/> which represent [[chivalry]].<ref name="crown-jewels">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5019.asp |title=The Crown Jewels |work=Ceremony and Symbols |author=Royal Household |accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> The Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by other bishops, then presents the Sword of State to the Sovereign. The Sovereign is then further robed, this time putting the ''Robe Royal'' and ''Stole Royal'' on top of the ''supertunica''. The Archbishop then delivers several [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] to the Sovereign. First, he delivers the [[Sovereign's Orb|Orb]],<ref name="oremus"/> a hollow golden sphere set with numerous precious and semi-precious stones. The Orb is surmounted by a cross, representing the rule of [[Jesus]] over the world;<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown, Orb & Sceptre'', p209</ref> it is returned to the Altar immediately after being received.<ref name="oremus"/> Next, the Sovereign receives a ring representing the "marriage" between him or her and the nation.<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown, Orb & Sceptre'', p212<U+2013>3</ref> The [[Sceptre with the Dove]] (so called because it is surmounted by a dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]]) and the [[Sceptre with the Cross]] (which incorporates [[Cullinan Diamond|Cullinan I]], the largest cut diamond in the world) are delivered to the Sovereign.<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown, Orb & Sceptre'', p210</ref> As the Sovereign holds the two sceptres, the Archbishop of Canterbury places [[St Edward's Crown]] on his or her head. All cry "God Save the King [Queen]", placing their coronets and caps on their heads. Cannon are fired from the Tower of London.<ref name="oremus"/>

== End of the ceremony ==

[[Image:Elizabeth_I_in_coronation_robes.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth I wore the crown and held the sceptre and orb at the end of her coronation.]]

The Sovereign is then borne into the Throne. The Archbishops and Bishops swear their fealty, saying "I, N., Archbishop [Bishop] of N., will be faithful and true, and faith and truth will bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord [Lady], King [Queen] of this Realm and Defender of the Faith, and unto your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God." The peers then proceed to pay their homage, saying "I, N., Duke [Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron or Lord] of N., do become your liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and faith and truth will I bear unto you, to live and die, against all manner of folks. So help me God."<ref name="oremus"/> The clergy pay homage together, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Next, members of the Royal Family pay homage individually. The peers are led by the premier peers of their rank: the Dukes by the Premier Duke, the Marquesses by the Premier Marquess, and so forth.<ref name="oremus"/> 

If there is a [[Queen Consort]], she is crowned in a very simple ceremony immediately before homage is paid. A [[Queen Regnant]]'s husband, however, is not separately crowned. The Communion ceremony interrupted earlier is resumed and completed.<ref name="royal.gov-coronation"/>

The Sovereign then exits the Coronation Theatre, entering St Edward's Chapel (also within the Abbey), preceded by the bearers of the Sword of State, the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice and the Sword of Mercy (the last has a blunt tip).<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown, Orb & Sceptre'', p211<U+2013>2</ref> The [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]] and [[Sceptre]]s worn by the Sovereign, as well as all other regalia, are laid at the Altar;<ref name="oremus"/> the Sovereign removes the ''Robe Royal'' and ''Stole Royal'', exchanges the ''crimson surcoat'' for the ''purple surcoat''<ref name="cox-sovereigns-robes"/> and is enrobed in the ''Imperial Robe of purple velvet''. He or she then wears the [[Imperial State Crown]] and takes into his or her hands the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb and leaves the chapel while all present sing the [[God Save the Queen|National Anthem]].<ref name="oremus"/>

== Music ==

Music played at coronations is primarily classical and religiously inspired. The most oft-used piece is ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'', a religious composition by [[George Frideric Handel]] based on texts from the [[Bible]]. The work was commissioned for George II's coronation in 1727, and has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. [[Hubert Parry]]'s ''I Was Glad'' was written as the entrance anthem for the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], and contains a bridge section partway through so that the King's or Queen's Scholars of [[Westminster School]] can exercise their right to be the first commoners to acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional "vivat"s as he or she enters the coronation theatre. This anthem and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s ''Gloria in Excelsis'' have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the national anthem, ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' (or King).<ref>Hughes, ''Music of the Coronation over a Thousand Years''</ref> Other composers whose music featured in Elizabeth II's coronation include [[George Dyson|Sir George Dyson]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[William Henry Harris|Sir William Henry Harris]], [[Herbert Howells]], [[William Walton|Sir William Walton]], [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and the Canadian-resident but English-born [[Healey Willan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/royalty/coronations/coronation-music/| title=Coronation Music|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn be included. This was approved by the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan Williams recast his 1928 setting of the English metrical version of Psalm 100, the Jubilate Deo ("All people that on earth do dwell") for congregation, organ and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the Anglophone world.<ref>''Music for the Coronation'', p306</ref>

== Coronation banquet ==

Traditionally, the coronation was immediately followed by a banquet, held in [[Westminster Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]] (which also serves as the home to the Houses of Parliament). The [[Queen's Champion|King's Champion]] (the office being held by the [[Dymoke]] family in connection with the [[Manor of Scrivelsby]]) would ride into the hall on horseback, wearing a knight's armour, with the Lord High Constable riding to his right and the Earl Marshal riding to his left. A herald would then proclaim,<ref name="1911-coronation"/>

: "If any person, of what degree soever, high or low, shall deny or gainsay our Sovereign Lord ..., King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, son and next heir unto our Sovereign Lord the last King deceased, to be the right heir to the Imperial Crown of this Realm of Great Britain and Ireland, or that he ought not to enjoy the same; here is his Champion, who saith that he lieth, and is a false traitor, being ready in person to combat with him; and in this quarrel will adventure his life against him, on what day soever he shall be appointed."<ref name="1911-coronation">Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica (1911), ''Coronation''</ref>

The King's Champion would then throw down the gauntlet; the ceremony would be repeated at the centre of the hall and at the High Table (where the Sovereign would be seated). The Sovereign would then drink to the Champion from a gold cup, which he would then present to the latter.<ref name="1911-coronation"/>

The offices of [[Chief Butler of England]], [[Grand Carver of England]] and [[The Master Carver|Master Carver of Scotland]] were also associated with the Coronation Banquet.<ref name="keepers">Bruce, ''Keepers of the Kingdom'', p29</ref>

Banquets have not been held since the coronation of George IV in 1821. George IV's coronation was the most elaborate in history; his brother and successor William IV eliminated the banquet, and William's desire to eliminate the costly banquet has now apparently become the custom.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', p374<U+2013>5</ref> A banquet was considered in 1902 for [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] but his sudden illness put a stop to the plans.<ref name="keepers"/> In 1953, the dish [[Coronation chicken|''Coronation Chicken'']] was created for the informal meal served to the guests.<ref name="50-facts"/>

== Dates of recent coronations ==

{{dablink|See [[List of coronations of British monarchs]]}}

== Enthronement as Emperor ==

Victoria assumed the title ''[[Emperor of India|Empress of India]]'' in 1876.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=24319|startpage=2667|date=28 April 1876|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> A [[Delhi Durbar|durbar]] (court) was held at [[Delhi]] on 1&nbsp;January 1877 to proclaim the assumption of the title. Victoria did not attend personally, but was represented by the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]].<ref>''The Times'', 2 January 1877, p5</ref> A similar durbar was held on 1&nbsp;January 1903 to celebrate the accession of Edward VII, who was represented by his brother the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]].<ref>''The Times'', 2 January 1903, p3</ref> In 1911, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] also held a coronation durbar; however, he and his wife attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for the Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian nation, George V was not crowned in India; instead, he wore a crown as he entered the Durbar. British law prohibited the removal of the British Crown Jewels from the nation; therefore, a separate crown, known as the [[Imperial Crown of India]], was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain political decisions, such as the decision to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, were announced at the Durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by George VI in 1948 (though India had become independent a year earlier).<ref>Hilliam, ''Crown Orb & Sceptre'', p185<U+2013>6</ref>
