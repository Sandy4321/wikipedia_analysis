'''Denis Mukwege'''{{pronunciation needed}} (born 1 March 1955)<ref name="eu141021"/><ref name="fondationchirac131010"/> is a Congolese gynecologist. He founded and works in [[Panzi Hospital]] in [[Bukavu]], where he specializes in the treatment of women who have been [[Gang rape|gang-raped]] by rebel forces. Mukwege has become the world's leading expert on how to repair the internal physical damage caused by gang rape.<ref name=Nolen/>

Mukwege has treated thousands of women who were victims of [[War rape|gang wartime rape]] since the [[Second Congo War]], some of them more than once, performing up to 10 surgeries a day during his 18-hour working days. He has described how his patients arrive at the hospital sometimes naked, usually in horrific condition.<ref name=Nolen>Nolen, Stephanie. "Where repairing rape damage is an expertise," ''The Globe and Mail'', October 22, 2008.</ref>  In 2014, Mukwege was awarded the [[European Union]]'s [[Sakharov Prize]] and he has also been described as a potential candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/world/africa/nobel-prize-congo-surgeon-mukegwe/|title=Nobel Peace Prize: Congo rape trauma surgeon among favorites|date=10 October 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Mukwege was the third of nine children born to a [[Pentecostal]] minister and his wife. He studied medicine because he wanted to heal the sick people for whom his father prayed, working at first in a rural hospital, then traveling to [[France]] to study gynecology at the [[University of Angers]], after seeing the complications of childbirth experienced by women in the Congo who had no access to specialist healthcare.<ref name=Nolen/>

==United Nations speech==
In September 2012, Mukwege gave a speech at the United Nations where he condemned impunity for mass rape in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Presentation to the United Nations 25/9/2012 by Dr. Denis Mukwege|url=http://www.panzihospital.org/archives/1027|publisher=[[Panzi Hospital]]|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> and criticized the Congolese government and other countries "for not doing enough to stop what he called 'an unjust war that has used violence against women and rape as a strategy of war.'"<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last1=Cowell|first1=Alan|last2=Gettleman|first2=Jeffrey|title=Denis Mukwege, Congolese Gynecologist, Is Awarded Sakharov Prize|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/world/europe/denis-mukwege-congolese-gynecologist-is-awarded-sakharov-prize.html?_r=0|accessdate=22 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=22 October 2014}}</ref>

==Assassination attempt and return==
On October 25, 2012, four armed men attacked his residence while he was not home, held his daughters hostage, and waited for his return to assassinate him. Upon his return, his guard intervened and was shot dead by the assassins. They missed Mukwege as he dropped to the ground during the shooting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/an-attack-on-one-of-my-heroes-dr-denis-mukwege/?smid=fb-share |title=An Attack on One of My Heroes, Dr. Denis Mukwege |author=Nicholas Kristof |date=October 26, 2012 |work=The New York Times |archivedate=22 October 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BhWRLNAB |accessdate=22 October 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> After the assassination attempt, Mukwege went into exile in Europe and the Panzi Hospital reported that his absence has had a <U+201C>devastating effect<U+201D> on its daily operations.<ref>{{Citation
