'''Kevin Wu''' (born June 12, 1990)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kevjumba.com/Post/Its-a-Celebration/027F2FFFF009C000D00080099C010 |title=It's a Celebration |accessdate=2008-11-01 |last=Wu |first=Kevin |publisher=KevJumba.com}}</ref> is an American-based comedian and [[list of YouTube celebrities|YouTube celebrity]] who is best known by his [[YouTube]] username of '''KevJumba'''.  He was YouTube's number one subscribed comedian and third most subscribed user overall on June 5, 2008.  The ''San Francisco Chronicle''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jeff Yang has noted that Wu is not a conventional comedian but that by "just talking (he) is, well, pretty hilarious" due to his deadpan vocal delivery, animated facial expressions and tendency toward unexpected digressions.<ref name="Yang"/>  Wu previously appeared on [[The CW Television Network]]'s shortlived ''[[Online Nation]]'' and is currently co-starring with [[Jessica Lee Rose]] and Phil DeFranco in ''Hooking Up'' from HBOLabs (the online arm of [[HBO]]).<ref name="Reuters"/>

==YouTube videos==
Kevin Wu was inspired to put comedy videos on [[YouTube]] by the stand-up performances of [[Dave Chapelle]]. He chose the YouTube username KevJumba because his friend used MattJumba as a screename, and he thought it was funny. Wu chose YouTube because of his lack of resources and an audience.  When Wu's "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" video was featured, his number of viewers began to increase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aarising.com/aprofiler/kevjumba.htm |title=A-Profiler: Kevjumba |accessdate=2008-09-27 |last=Wong |first=Nelson |publisher=AArisings}}</ref> In this video, Wu says that the three stereotypes he must deal with as an Asian are that he is "cheap", a "nerd", and has "no social life". He tries to prove that he is not cheap by stating that he recently bought a "brand new, top of the line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype because he does not "make all A's...in school today (he) made a B+". He goes on to say he can prove he has a social life because his cell phone rings all the time. At this point, his phone rings, he answers it, and the voice on the other end says, "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbZ9zJ22WfQ |title=I Have to Deal With Stereotypes |accessdate=2008-11-02 |last=Wu |first=Kevin |date=March 08, 2007 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Jeff Yang of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' describes Wu as perhaps the most interesting elite YouTube personality, going from obscurity to YouTube's most subscribed comedian in a few months (when a user subscribes to another user's channel, YouTube puts the subscribees videos in the subscriber's subscription center and puts the subscribee's most recent video on the subscriber's homepage).<ref name="Yang"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=70181&cbid=1rcazecqxnl7a&src=cb&lev=topic |title=Getting Started: YouTube Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-01 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>   According to Yang, Wu's videos are not strictly comedy, consisting mostly of "stuff that Kevin finds interesting, weird or irritating." Yang describes Wu's videos as "mesmerizing", although he has difficulty pinpointing why.  Yang ultimately feels it is due to Wu's self-confidence, singling out the video "I Need Help With the Females" and its self-deprecating humor and relaxed delivery.<ref name="Yang">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/05/DDIF113834.DTL&hw=youtube&sn=009&sc=739 |title=On top of YouTube: Happy Slip, Choi, KevJumba |accessdate=2008-09-27 |authorlink=Jeff Yang |last=Yang |first=Jeff |date=June 5, 2008 |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''}}</ref>  In "I Need Help with the Females", Wu describes how males will sometimes ask him for dating advice, which he is unable to provide because females are like "another species" that he does not understand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yoIhP0xDog |title=I Need Help With the Females |accessdate=2008-11-02 |last=Wu |first=Kevin |date=May 29, 2007 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

As of November 1, 2008, Wu had more than 330,000 subscribers and more than 10,400,000 views of his [[YouTube#Channel type|channel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=kevjumba |title=kevjumba's channel |accessdate=2008-11-01 |date=2008-11-01 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>  On February 26, 2008 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' compared the web series [[quarterlife]]'s viewership to Wu's.  At the time Wu was a "semi-well known YouTube blogger" and had received 450,000 views for a video describing how he broke his shin.  quarterlife, which had been picked up by [[NBC]], had received only 100,000 views on [[MySpace]] and 50,000 views on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/02/14life.html |title='Quarterlife's' improbable third quarter |accessdate=2008-09-30 |date=Feb 26 2008 |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}</ref>

By May 29, 2008, Wu had become one of three [[Asian people|Asians]] under the age of 21 to be in the top five of YouTube's all-time most subscribed users with 187,000 subscribers and more than 5.9 million views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/29/DD8E10UHVF.DTL&feed=rss.entertainment |title=Asian heritage more popular with kids today |accessdate=2008-09-27 |authorlink=Jeff Yang |last=Yang |first=Jeff |date=May 29, 2008 |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''}}</ref>  By June 5, 2008 he had become the number one subscribed comedian on YouTube, and third most subscribed uploader overall.<ref name="Yang"/>  Wu's videos have received replies from [[Jessica Alba]] and [[Baron Davis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/836 |title=Five-minute fame |accessdate=2008-09-27 |last=Mallet |first=Jeremy |date=May 21, 2008 |publisher=''[[The California Aggie]]''}}</ref>  In 2008, Davis created a "longest stare" contest for ibeatyou.com, a site that he and Alba's husband Cash Warren co-founded.
