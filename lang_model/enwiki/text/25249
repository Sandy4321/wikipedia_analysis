Born in the [[United Arab Emirates]], Banihammad left his family to pursue relief work. Using the [[Visa Express]] program, Banihammad obtained a U.S. tourist visa and arrived in the United States in June 2001. Banihammad boarded [[United Airlines Flight 175]] on September 11, 2001 and participated in the hijacking of the plane so that [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] could fly the plane into the south tower of the [[World Trade Center]] as part of the [[September 11th attacks]].

==Aliases==
Both Banihammad and the media would often refer to him by one of his aliases, including "Fayez Ahmad", "Banihammad Fayez Abu Dhabi Banihammad", "Fayez Rashid Ahmed", "Rasid Ahmed Hassen Alqadi", "Abu Dhabi Banihammad Ahmed Fayez", and others.

==History==
=== Early Life ===
Banihammad was from [[Khor Fakkan]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/UA00455-2A.html|title=United States v. Zacarias Moussaoui, trial exhibit UA00455.2A}}</ref> and was born to Muhammad Fayez al-Shehri, a school principal. He typically went by the name "Ahmed".<ref name="willalOmari">Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others</ref>

=== 2000 ===
Fayez told his parents, while spending time in [['Asir]], that he hoped to find work with the [[International Islamic Relief Organization]]. He only contacted his parents once after that.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030208094526/www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=9454&ArY=2001&ArM=10&ArD=1|author=Ba-Isa, Molouk Y. and Saud Al-Towaim |title=Another Saudi <U+2018>hijacker<U+2019> turns up in Tunis |date=October 1, 2001 |publisher=''Arab News'' |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> He is believed to have visited the [[Philippines]] for three days from October 17-20, 2000.

Banihammad used the controversial program [[Visa Express]] to gain entry into the country together with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. Upon later review of his application, it was noticed that he hadn't listed an occupation or reason for visit, and when asked where he would be living in the country, simply wrote ''No''. However, he still received his Visa.

=== 2001 ===
Before the pair arrived in [[Orlando, Florida]] on June 27, 2001, Banihammad had opened a bank account in the UAE to which $30,000 was deposited by unknown parties only two days before his arrival. He opened another account with [[SunTrust Banks]] in Orlando several days after his arrival, becoming one of nine hijackers to open an account with the bank. 

Known as ''Abu Ahmed al-Imaraati'' during the preparations,<ref name="willalOmari"/> the [[9/11 Commission]] noted: "He appears to have played a unique role among the muscle hijackers because of his work with one of the plot's financial facilitators, [[Mustafa al Hawsawi]]." On July 18, Banihammad gave Mustafa power-of-attorney over his [[Dubai]] bank account, and Mustafa reportedly mailed him a [[Visa Inc.|VISA]] and bank card.

Possibly a licensed pilot, a man with his name was registered as having trained at the Spartan Aeronautics School in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], although the school denies that he ever attended, indicating a possible case of mistaken identity.

== Attacks ==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 175}}
Fayez Banihammad purchased both his and [[Mohand al-Shehri]]'s one-way first class tickets for [[United Airlines Flight 175]] online on August 27 or [[August 29|29]], charging the $4464.50 to a [[Visa Inc.|Visa card]] from [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]], listing both of their addresses as a [[Mail Boxes Etc.]] in [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]]. This was not the same postal box used by [[Hamza al-Ghamdi|Hamza]] and [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] who purchased their tickets for the same flight a day later with another Mailboxes Etc. postal box in Delray Beach, although both groups listed the same phone number.

Staying in the Milner Hotel from September 8-10, Banihammad asked a hotel clerk to fill out the registration card for the room, citing his poor English. On September 10, 2001, he shared a room with four hijackers; Mohand al-Shehri, [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] and [[Satam al-Suqami]] at the Milner Hotel in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

On September 11, Banihammad boarded Flight 175, he sat in seat 2A, adjacent to Shehri. About a half an hour into the flight, the plane was hijacked and [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] flew it into the south tower of the [[World Trade Center]] as part of the coordinated attacks.

== Aftermath ==
After the attacks it was reported by [[ABC News]] that somebody with the same name had attended the [[Defense Language Institute#Defense Language Institute English Language Center (DLIELC)|Defense Language Institute]] at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] - a claim that may have been born of a false address Banihammad had used.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20031206062021/http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/disinfo/deceptions/abc_wtcsuspects.html "Who Did It?"] ''ABC News''. 2003.</ref>
