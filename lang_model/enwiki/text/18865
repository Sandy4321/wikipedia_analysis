'''Jos<U+00E9> Alberto Barroso Machado e Costa''' (born 31 October 1953 in [[Porto]]) is a retired [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Association football|footballer]] who played mostly as a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]], and a current [[Coach (sport)|coach]].

In 15 [[Primeira Liga]] seasons - 16 as a professional in total - he amassed totals of 322 games and 39 goals, in representation of four teams, namely [[F.C. Porto|Porto]]. Subsequently, he embarked in a lengthy managerial career.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Still a junior Costa made his professional - and [[Primeira Liga|top division]] - debuts with [[Associa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Acad<U+00E9>mica de Coimbra - O.A.F.|Acad<U+00E9>mica de Coimbra]], appearing in 12 first-team games in an eventual [[1971<U+2013>72 Primeira Liga|relegation]], and contributing with 18 and two goals in an immediate promotion back.

After scoring a career-best 10 goals in [[1977<U+2013>78 Primeira Liga|1977<U+2013>78]] with the ''Students'', he signed for national powerhouse [[F.C. Porto]]. A classic winger with an above-average physical condition - he practiced [[track and field]] and [[Team handball|handball]] in his first club, ''Sport Clube Vila Real''<ref name="STARS">[http://estre-do-fcp.blogspot.com/2009/05/jose-alberto-costa.html Estrelas do FCP (FCP stars)]; 31 May 2009</ref> - he went on to form a formidable attacking trio in the club with [[Fernando Gomes]] and [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Lu<U+00ED>s Alves Ribeiro Oliveira|Ant<U+00F3>nio Oliveira]], being instrumental in the conquest of six major titles, including two national championships. He was voted the ''Portuguese Footballer of The Year'' in 1979,<ref>[http://www.rf.com/miscellaneous/portpoy.html Portugal - Footballer of the Year]; at [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]</ref> and also appeared as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in [[1984 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|the final]] of the [[1983<U+2013>84 European Cup Winners' Cup|1983<U+2013>84]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], lost against [[Juventus F.C.]] in [[Basel]].<ref>[http://w/ec/ec198384.html#cwc European Cup Winners' Cup 1983-84]; at RSSSF</ref> 

The name of Costa was connected to the "Ver<U+00E3>o Quente" ("Hot [[summer]]") of 1980, when a group of 15 players, including [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Lima Pereira]], Oliveira, [[Oct<U+00E1>vio Machado]], [[Jaime Pacheco]], [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Sousa]] and Gomes, suspended their club activity sympathizing with manager [[Jos<U+00E9> Maria Pedroto]] and [[director of football]] [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa]], who had entered in "collision course" with chairman Am<U+00E9>rico de S<U+00E1>.<ref name="STARS"/> He still remained with the five a further five seasons but, after the consecutive emergence of [[Vermelhinho]] and 17-year old [[Paulo Futre]], he lost his importance in the team, for example only appearing in five games in [[1984<U+2013>85 Primeira Liga|1984<U+2013>85]].

Aged nearly 32, Costa joined [[Vit<U+00F3>ria S.C.|Vit<U+00F3>ria Sport Clube]], helping the [[Guimar<U+00E3>es]]-based club [[1985<U+2013>86 Primeira Liga|finish fourth]] and [[1986<U+2013>87 UEFA Cup|qualify]] to the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. On 24 November 1985, he scored his only goal of the season by helping defeat [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] 4<U+2013>3 at home, and retired from the game in June 1987 after a slow year with [[C.S. Mar<U+00ED>timo]].

===International===
Costa gained 24 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], and scored one goal,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/port-recintlp.html Portugal - Record International Players]; at RSSSF</ref> against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in his second international match. His debut came on 8 March 1978 in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] with [[French national football team|France]] in [[Paris]], while he was still a member of Acad<U+00E9>mica. 

Costa did not represent the nation at any international competition, and his last appearance was on 28 October 1983 against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], in a 1<U+2013>0 away win for the [[UEFA Euro 1984]] [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|qualifiers]].

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a professional footballer, Costa, who has a solid academic education (he completed a degree in [[Mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Coimbra]]<ref name="STARS"/>), embarked on a coaching career. He briefly acted as assistant to [[Juca]] in the national team, then took charge of its youth sides and also assisted the following national team manager, [[Carlos Queiroz]]. His first head coach experience was with former team Acad<U+00E9>mica, in the [[Liga de Honra|second division]], remaining one season with the club.

Costa again worked with Queiroz at Sporting, [[Red Bull New York|NY/NJ MetroStars]], [[Nagoya Grampus]] and the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates national team]]. In the late 1990s, he returned to head coaching duties, consecutively managing [[F.C. Famalic<U+00E3>o]] (second division), [[F.C. Vizela]] ([[Portuguese Second Division|third]]), [[Varzim S.C.|Varzim SC]] (first) and [[G.D. Chaves]] (second).

In 2005, Costa was hired to work in the USA, for the "USA Seventeen Soccer Academy", as a technical director. He established himself in [[Santa Clara, California]], assisting and technically supervising the various echelons of the academy. In July 2008, he was reunited with Queiroz as he joined the scouting department of the Portuguese national team, working alongside [[Oceano da Cruz]] and [[England|English]] Julian Ward.<ref name="STARS"/> 

In November 2011, Costa was appointed as head coach of [[Iran Pro League]] side [[Sanat Naft Abadan FC]], replacing [[Gholam Hossein Peyrovani]].
