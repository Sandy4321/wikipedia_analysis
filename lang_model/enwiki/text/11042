[[File:Devor<U+00E9> velvet (also known as burnout technique).jpg|thumb|Devor<U+00E9> <U+2013> or burnout technique <U+2013> applied to green velvet fabric]]
'''Devor<U+00E9>''' (also called '''burnout''') is a fabric technique particularly used on [[velvet]]s, where a mixed-fibre material undergoes a chemical process to dissolve the [[cellulose fiber]]s to create a semi-transparent pattern against more solidly woven fabric. The same technique can also be applied to textiles other than velvet, such as lace or the fabrics in burnout [[t-shirt]]s.<ref name=margo/>

Devor<U+00E9> comes from the French verb ''d<U+00E9>vorer'', meaning literally to devour.<ref name="TA Swift">{{cite web|last1=Swift|first1=Dionne|title=Exploring Devor<U+00E9>...|url=http://www.textilearts.net/tutors/dionneswift/devore.php|website=textilearts.net|publisher=Textile Arts|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="1980s  Fogg">{{cite book|last1=Fogg|first1=Marnie|title=1980s Fashion Print|date=2009|publisher=Anova Books (Batsford)|location=London|isbn=978 19063 8841 6|page=13|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref>

==History==
Burnout fabrics are thought to have originated in France, possibly as a cheap alternative to lace that could be created using caustic paste on fabric.<ref name="TA Swift"/> The commercial chemical process used in fashion garments was developed in [[Lyon]] at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name="Indie Hume">{{cite news|last1=Hume|first1=Marian|title=Fashion: Mr Contran's fin de siecle: Severity, thy name was Jasper: Now he who cleaved to chaste lines and plain black has taken to more exotic stuff.

The technique was popularised in the 1920s <U+2013> typically used on evening gowns and shawls <U+2013> and revived in the 1980s and '90s, notably by [[Jasper Conran]] on theatrical costumes and then evening wear and by [[Georgina von Etzdorf]] on scarves.<ref name="TA Swift"/><ref name="Herald Brennan">{{cite news|last1=Brennan|first1=Mary|title=All hands to tutu|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/all-hands-to-tutu-1.716316|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=10 March 1994}}</ref><ref name="Independent Roffey">{{cite news|last1=Roffey|first1=Monique|title=In thing: Georgina von Etzdorf scarves|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/in-thing-georgina-von-etzdorf-scarves-1412305.html|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=The Independent|date=8 July 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Georgina von Etzdorf: 25 years of sensuous textiles|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/exhibitions/index.php?itemID=14|website=manchestergalleries.org|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>

===1990s revival===
Conran is credited with popularising devor<U+00E9>, introducing it in 1989 and taking the technique forward in the 1990s in his main fashion line.<ref name="Indie Hume"/> He refined his techniques on theatrical costumes; in the 1992 production of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' directed by [[Simon Callow]], burnout fabrics were heavily used for the costumes of [[Eliza Doolittle]] and street vendors.<ref name="Indie Hume"/> Conran's devor<U+00E9> technique also featured in [[David Bintley]]'s 1993 [[Royal Ballet]] production of ''Tombeaux'', where it was used to create the two-tone velvet tutu worn by [[Darcy Bussell]] and the corps de ballet costumes.<ref name="Indie Hume"/><ref name="Birmingham Bintley">{{cite web|last1=Bintley|first1=David|title=Recapturing a Dream: David Bintley on Tombeaux|url=http://www.brb.org.uk/tombeaux-2013.html|publisher=Birmingham Royal Ballet|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref> In 1994, it featured in the [[Scottish Ballet]] production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', where Conran said it produced better results for lower cost than [[appliqu<U+00E9>]] techniques.<ref name="TA Swift"/><ref name="Herald Brennan"/>

Conran's most elaborate devor<U+00E9> fashion pieces <U+2013> which were oven baked as part of the process <U+2013> were time-consuming to produce and expensive to buy; in 1993, a panelled evening skirt retailed at <U+00A3>572 and an acid-treated shirt cost <U+00A3>625.<ref name="Indie Hume"/>

Established as a [[Wiltshire]] textile printing workshop in 1981, Georgina von Etzdorf's primary focus was on creating painterly effects on fabric. Credited with popularising the velvet scarf, she introduced devor<U+00E9> to the range in 1993 <U+2013> having experimented with printed velvets from 1985.<ref name="Pattern Design Jackson">{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Lesley|title=Twentieth Century Pattern Design|date=8 February 2007|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1568987125|pages=209<U+2013>11|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c93jEZwcfPoC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=Georgina+von+Etzdorf&source=bl&ots=25qLISVE1d&sig=BZnd2Z6ZtlJcitR_1mtRFQun_GE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-cO7U-7EIqLB7AbE_4DACQ&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=Georgina%20von%20Etzdorf&f=false|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>

==Method==
Devor<U+00E9> techniques use blended fabrics which combine protein-based fibres such as [[silk]] with cellulose-based fibres such as [[viscose]], [[cotton]], or [[rayon]]. In order to create the 'burnout' pattern, a chemical gel containing [[sodium hydrogen sulphate]] is applied to the fabric in patterns, dissolving away the cellulose-based fibres and leaving behind the protein-based fibres, which are not affected by the chemical. The chemical gel may be applied either by printing or by hand painting on the fabric.<ref name=margo>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Margo|title=Textile Surface Decoration: Silk and Velvet|year=2007|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812220001|pages=35}}</ref>
