[[File:Hawaii Volcanoes Hazard Map.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Island of Hawaii|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] was mapped into 9 Zones meant to portray the future long-term hazard due to lava flow activity[[USGS]].]]
'''Lava Flow Hazard Zones''' are areas designated by the [[United States Geological Survey]] for the Island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]] in the [[United States]]. First prepared in 1974 by Donal Mullineaux and Donald Peterson of the USGS,<ref>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1974/0239/]</ref> reprinted with enhanced text in 1987,<ref>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1987/1350/chapters/ch22_Mullineaux.pdf]</ref> and revised in 1992,<ref>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/mf/1992/2193/]</ref> the maps outline the qualitative hazard posed by lava flows based on the past history of lava flow activity on each of the 5 [[volcanoes]] that form the Island of Hawai{{okina}}i.<ref>[http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/hazards/lavazones/main.html Lava Flow Hazard Zones on the Island of Hawai`i - USGS]</ref>  Zone 1 represents the areas that are most hazardous and Zone 9 the least hazardous.

The lava flow hazard zones are based on location of eruptive vents, past lava coverage, and topography.

*Zone 1 - Includes summits and rift zones of Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes, where vents have been repeatedly active in historical time.
*Zone 2 - Areas adjacent to and downslope of zone 1. 15-25% of zone 2 has been covered by lava since 1800, and 25-75% has been covered within the past 750 years. Relative hazard within zone 2 decreases gradually as one moves away form zone 1.
*Zone 3 - Areas less hazardous than zone 2 because of greater distance from recently active vents and (or) because of topography. 1-5% of zone 3 has been covered since 1800, and 15-75% has been covered within the past 750 years.
*Zone 4 - Includes all of Hualalai, where the frequency of eruptions is lower than that for Kilauea or Mauna Loa. Lava coverage is proportionally smaller, about 5% since 1800, and less than 15% within the past 750 years.
*Zone 5 - Area on Kilauea currently protected by topography
*Zone 6 - Two areas on Mauna Loa, both protected by topography
*Zone 7 - Younger part of Mauna Kea volcano. 20% of this area was covered by lava in the past 10,000 years.
*Zone 8 - Remaining part of Mauna kea. Only a few percent of this area has been covered by lava in the past 10,000 years.
*Zone 9 - Kohala Volcano, which last erupted over 60,000 years ago.
