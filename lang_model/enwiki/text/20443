'''Albert Einstein''' ({{audio|Albert_Einstein_german.ogg|German pronunciation}}) ([[March 14]], [[1879]] <U+2013> [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[Germany|German]] born [[United States|American]] [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] widely regarded as the most important scientist of the 20th century and one of the greatest physicists of all time. He played a leading role in formulating the [[theory of relativity|special and general theories of relativity]]; moreover, he made significant contributions to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. He was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] in 1905 (his "[[Annus Mirabilis Papers|wonderful year]]") and "for his services to Theoretical Physics."

After British [[solar eclipse]] expeditions in 1919 reported confirmation that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the [[gravitation|gravity]] of the Sun in the amount he had predicted in his theory of relativity, Einstein became world-famous, an unusual achievement for a scientist. The London Times ran the headline on [[7 November]] [[1919]]: "Revolution in science - New theory of the Universe - Newtonian ideas overthrown". In popular culture, his name has become synonymous with great intelligence and [[genius]].

==Biography==
===Youth and college===
[[Image:Young Albert Einstein.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Young Albert before the Einsteins moved from [[Germany]] to [[Italy]].]]

Einstein was born on [[March 14]], [[1879]] in the city of [[Ulm]] in [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]], Germany, about 100 km east of [[Stuttgart]]. His father was Hermann Einstein, a salesman who later ran an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] works, and his mother was Pauline, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Koch. They were married in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt. Albert's family members were all non-observant [[Jew]]s and he attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]]. At the insistence of his mother, he was given [[violin]] lessons. Though he initially disliked the lessons, and eventually discontinued them, he would later take great solace in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[violin sonata]]s.

When Einstein was five, his father showed him a pocket [[compass]], and Einstein realized that something in "empty" space acted upon the needle; he would later describe the experience as one of the most revelatory events of his life. He built [[model (physical)|models]] and [[machine|mechanical devices]] for fun and showed great mathematical ability early on.  

In 1889, a medical student named Max Talmud (later: Talmey) introduced Einstein to key science and philosophy texts, including [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by recommending and providing books on science, mathematics and philosophy. 

Einstein attended the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]], where he received a relatively progressive education. He began to learn [[mathematics]] around age twelve; in 1891, he taught himself [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean plane geometry]] from a school booklet and began to study [[calculus]]. While at the Gymnasium, he clashed with authority and resented the school regimen, believing that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such endeavors as strict [[rote learning|memorization]].

In 1894, following the failure of Hermann Einstein's electrochemical business, the Einsteins moved from [[Munich]] to [[Pavia]], a city in [[Italy]] near [[Milan]]. Einstein's first scientific work, called "''The Investigation of the State of [[aether theories|Aether]] in [[magnetic field|Magnetic Fields]]''", was written contemporaneously. Albert remained behind in Munich lodgings to finish school, completing only one term before leaving the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in the spring of 1895 to rejoin his family in Pavia. He quit a year and a half prior to final examinations without telling his parents, convincing the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor, but this meant that he had no [[secondary education|secondary-school]] certificate.<ref>Highfield.</ref> That year, at the age of 16, he performed the [[thought experiment]] known as "Albert Einstein's mirror". After gazing into a mirror, he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the [[speed of light]]; his conclusion, that the speed of light is independent of the observer, would later become one of the two [[postulates of special relativity]].

Although he excelled in the mathematics and science portion of the ''[[ETH Zurich|Eidgen<U+00F6>ssische Technische Hochschule]]'' (ETH, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]]) entrance exam the following year, his failure of the liberal arts portion was a setback; his family sent him to [[Aarau]], [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school, and it became clear that he was not going to be an [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] as his father intended for him. There, he studied the seldom-taught [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]] and received his diploma in September 1896. During this time, he lodged with Professor Jost Winteler's family and became enamoured with Marie, their daughter and his first sweetheart. Einstein's sister, Maja, who was perhaps his closest confidant, was to later marry their son, Paul, and his friend, [[Michele Besso]], married their other daughter, Anna.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Einstein subsequently enrolled at the ''Eidgen<U+00F6>ssische Technische Hochschule'' in October and moved to Z<U+00FC>rich, while Marie moved to [[Olsberg, Switzerland]] for a teaching post. The same year, he renounced his [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] citizenship and became [[stateless person|stateless]].

In the spring of 1896, the [[Serbia]]n [[Mileva Mari<U+0107>]] started initially as a medical student at the [[University of Zurich]], but after a term switched to the same section as Einstein as the only woman that year to study for the same diploma. Einstein's relationship with Mari<U+0107> developed into romance over the next few years, which Einstein's family opposed based on the fact that she was not Jewish, older, and physically "defective."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/opb/einsteinswife/family/index.htm PBS - Einstein's Wife - Families & Allies]</ref>

In 1900, Einstein was granted a teaching diploma by the ''Eidgen<U+00F6>ssische Technische Hochschule'' ([[ETH Zurich]]). Einstein then published his first paper, on the [[capillary action|capillary forces]] of a drinking straw, titled "''Folgerungen aus den Capillarit<U+00E4>tserscheinungen''", which translated is "''Consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena''" (found in "''Annalen der Physik''" volume 4, page 513). In it, he tried to unify the [[physical law|laws of physics]], an attempt he would continually make throughout his life. Through his friend Michelle Besso, an [[engineer]], Einstein was presented with the works of [[Ernst Mach]], and would later consider him "the best sounding board in Europe" for physical ideas. During this time, Einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends, including Besso and Mari<U+0107>. The men referred to themselves as the "Olympia Academy". Einstein and Mari<U+0107> had a daughter out of wedlock, [[Lieserl Einstein]], born in January 1902. Her fate is unknown; some believe she died in infancy, while others believe she was given out for adoption.

===Works and doctorate===
[[Image:Einstein patentoffice.jpg|frame|right||Einstein in 1905, when he wrote the "''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers]]''"]]
Einstein could not find a teaching post upon graduation, mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most of his professors. The father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant [[patent clerk|examiner]] at the Swiss Patent Office<ref>{{cite web | title=The institute / IPI / Federal Institute of Intellectual Property | url=http://www.ipi.ch/E/institut/i1.shtm | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> in 1902. There, Einstein judged the worth of [[inventor]]s' [[patent]] applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand <U+2014> in particular he was chiefly charged to evaluate [[patents]] relating to electromagnetic devices.<ref>Galison p. 368.</ref> He also learned how to discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions, and was taught by the director how "to express [him]self correctly". He occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work.

Einstein married [[Mileva Mari<U+0107>]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Einstein's marriage to Mari<U+0107>, who was a mathematician, was both a personal and intellectual partnership: Einstein referred to Mileva as "a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as I am". [[Ronald W. Clark]], a biographer of Einstein, claimed that Einstein depended on the distance that existed in his and Mileva's marriage in order to have the solitude necessary to accomplish his work; he required intellectual isolation. [[Abram Joffe]], a Soviet physicist who knew Einstein, in an obituary of Einstein, wrote, "The author of [the papers of 1905] was ... a bureaucrat at the Patent Office in Bern, Einstein-Mari<U+0107>" and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship. However, according to Alberto A. Mart<U+00ED>nez of the Center for Einstein Studies at [[Boston University]], Joffe only ascribed authorship to Einstein, as he believed that it was a Swiss custom at the time to append the spouse's last name to the husband's name.<ref>{{cite web | title=Arguing about Einstein's wife (April 2004) - Physics World - PhysicsWeb (See above) | url=http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/17/4/2 | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> Whatever the truth, the extent of her influence on Einstein's work is a highly controversial and debated question.

In 1903, Einstein's position at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] had been made permanent, though he was passed over for promotion until he had "fully mastered machine technology".<ref>Galison p. 370.</ref> He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] after submitting his thesis "''A new determination of molecular dimensions''" ("''Eine neue Bestimmung der Molek<U+00FC>ldimensionen''") in 1905.

That same year, in his spare time, he wrote four articles that participated in the foundation of [[Physics#Classical and Modern physics|modern physics]], without much [[scientific literature]] to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories. Most physicists agree that three of those papers (on [[Brownian motion]], the [[photoelectric effect]], and [[special relativity]]) deserved [[Nobel Prize]]s. Only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the Nobel committee in the award.  The reason for this was that the time of the award, the photoelectric effect had the most unchallenged experimental evidence behind it, although the Nobel committee expressed the opinion that Einstein's other work would be confirmed in due course.

Some might regard the award for the photoelectric effect ironic, not only because Einstein is far better-known for relativity, but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon, and Einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] would take.

====Annus Mirabilis Papers====
{{details|Annus Mirabilis Papers}}

Einstein submitted this series of papers to the "''Annalen der Physik''". They are commonly referred to as the "''[[Annus Mirabilis Papers]]''" (from [[List of Latin phrases|''Annus mirabilis'']], [[Latin]] for 'year of wonders'). The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ([[IUPAP]]) commemorated the 100th year of the publication of Einstein's extensive work in 1905 as the '[[World Year of Physics 2005]]'.

The first paper, named "''On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light''", ("''<U+00DC>ber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt''") was specifically cited for his Nobel Prize.  In this paper, Einstein extends [[Max Planck|Planck's]] hypothesis of discrete energy elements to his own hypothesis that electromagnetic energy is absorbed or emitted by matter in quanta of <math>h \nu</math> (where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\nu</math> is the frequency of the light), proposing a new law

:<math>
E_{\mathrm{max}}  = h\nu - P
</math>

to account for the [[photoelectric effect]], as well as other properties of [[photoluminescence]] and [[photoionization]].  In later papers, Einstein used this law to describe the [[Volta effect]] (1906), the production of secondary [[cathode ray]]s (1909) and the high-frequency limit of [[Bremsstrahlung]] (1911).  Einstein's key contribution is his assertion that energy quantization is a general, intrinsic property of [[light]], rather than a particular constraint of the interaction between matter and light, as [[Max Planck|Planck]] believed.  Another, often overlooked result of this paper was Einstein's excellent estimate (6.17 <math>\times</math> 10<sup>23</sup>) of [[Avogadro's number]] (6.02 <math>\times</math> 10<sup>23</sup>).  However, Einstein does ''not'' propose that light is a particle in this paper; the "photon" concept was not proposed until 1909 (see below).

His second article in 1905, named "''On the Motion<U+2014>Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat<U+2014>of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid''", ("''[[<U+00DC>ber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W<U+00E4>rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl<U+00FC>ssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen]]''") covered his study of [[Brownian motion]], and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms. Before this paper, [[atom]]s were recognized as a useful concept, but [[physicist]]s and [[chemist]]s hotly debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave [[experimentalist]]s a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary [[microscope]]. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.<ref>[[Smoluchowski]] worked on Brownian motion at the same time as Einstein. He published in 1906 the same formula as Einstein (arrived at by a different method), except for a mistaken factor. See {{cite web | title=Paul Langevin<U+2019>s 1908 paper <U+2018><U+2018>On the Theory of Brownian Motion<U+2019><U+2019> | url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/Langevin1908.pdf | accessdate=March 17 | accessyear=2006 }} for details.</ref>

Einstein's third paper that year, "''On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies''" ("''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K<U+00F6>rper''"), was published in June 1905. This paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], a theory of time, distance, mass and energy which was consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omitted the force of [[gravity]]. While developing this paper, Einstein wrote to Mileva about "our work on relative motion", and this has led some to ask whether Mileva played a part in its development. A few historians of science believe that Einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous Frenchman [[Henri Poincar<U+00E9>]] had already published the equations of Relativity, a few weeks before Einstein submitted his paper; most believe their work was independent. Similarly, it's debatable if he knew the 1904 paper of Lorentz which contained most of the theory and to which Poincar<U+00E9> referred. See also [[relativity priority dispute]].

In a fourth paper, "''Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?''", ("''Ist die Tr<U+00E4>gheit eines K<U+00F6>rpers von seinem Energieinhalt abh<U+00E4>ngig?''"), published late in 1905, he showed that from relativity's [[axiom]]s, it is possible to deduce the famous equation which shows the equivalence between matter and energy. The [[energy]] equivalence (''E'') of some amount of mass (''m'') is that mass times the speed of light (''c'') squared: ''[[E=mc<U+00B2>|E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<U+00B2>]]''.

===Middle years===
[[Image:Einstein 1911 Solvay.jpg|frame|right|Einstein at the 1911 [[Solvay Conference]].]] 
In 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class. In 1908, Einstein was licensed in [[Bern]], Switzerland, as a [[Privatdozent]] (unsalaried teacher at a university). During this time, Einstein described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of [[critical opalescence]], which shows the cumulative effect of [[scattering]] of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ PBS - NOVA - Einstein's Big Idea - "Genius Among Geniuses", by Thomas Levenson]</ref> In 1911, Einstein became first associate [[professor]] at the [[University of Zurich]], and shortly afterwards full professor at the (German) [[University of Prague]]. While at Prague, Einstein published a paper calling on astronomers to test two predictions of his developing theory of relativity: a bending of light in a gravitational field, measurable at a solar eclipse; and a redshift of solar spectral lines relative to spectral lines produced on Earth's surface. A young German astronomer, Erwin Freundlich, began collaborating with Einstein and alerted other astronomers around the world about Einstein's astronomical tests.<ref>[Crelinsten, Jeffrey, Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity, Princeton University Press, 2006]</ref> In 1912, Einstein returned to [[Zurich]] in order to become full professor at the [[ETH Zurich]]. At that time, he worked closely with the [[mathematician]] [[Marcel Grossmann]], who introduced him to Riemannian geometry. In 1912, Einstein started to refer to [[time]] as the [[fourth dimension]] (although [[H.G. Wells]] had done this earlier, in 1895 in ''[[The Time Machine]]'').

In 1914, just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]] as professor at the local [[University of Berlin|university]] and became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. He took [[Prussia]]n citizenship. From 1914 to 1933, he served as director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Physics in Berlin. He also held the position of [[Professor#Netherlands|extraordinary professor]] at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] from 1920 until 1946, where he regularly gave guest lectures.

In 1917, Einstein published "''On the Quantum Mechanics of Radiation''" ("''Zur Quantenmechanik der Strahlung''", Physkalische Zeitschrift 18, 121-128). This article introduced the concept of [[stimulated emission]], the physical principle that allows light amplification in the [[laser]]. He also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behavior of the entire universe, setting the stage for modern [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. In this work he created his self-described "worst blunder", the [[cosmological constant]].

On [[May 14]], [[1904]], Albert and Mileva's first son, [[Hans Albert Einstein]], was born. Their second son, [[Eduard Einstein]], was born on [[July 28]], [[1910]]. Hans Albert became a professor of [[hydraulic engineering]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], having little interaction with his father, but sharing his love for sailing and music. Eduard, the younger brother, intended to practice as a [[psychoanalyst|Freudian analyst]] but was institutionalized for [[schizophrenia]] and died in an asylum. Einstein divorced Mileva on [[February 14]], [[1919]], and married his cousin Elsa L<U+00F6>wenthal (born Einstein: L<U+00F6>wenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]]. Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally). She was three years older than Albert, and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment; there were no children from this marriage.[[Image:Einstein theory triumphs.png|thumb|left|222px|"Einstein theory triumphs," declared the ''[[New York Times]]'' on [[November 10]] [[1919]].]]

====General relativity====
In November 1915, Einstein presented a series of lectures before the Prussian Academy of Sciences in which he described his theory of [[gravity]], known as [[general relativity]]. The final lecture ended with his introduction of an equation that replaced [[Newton's law of gravity]], the [[Einstein field equations#Mathematical form of Einstein.27s field equation|Field Equation]].<ref>[[David Hilbert]] actually published the field equation in an article that was dated five days before Einstein's lecture. But according to Thorne (pp. 117&ndash;118), Hilbert had discovered the correct derivation after "mulling over things he had learned" on a recent visit by Einstein to Gottingen. Thorne goes on to say "Quite naturally, and in accord with Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of warpage was quickly given the name the ''Einstein field equation'' rather than being named after Hilbert. .... In fact without Einstein the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later." See [[Relativity priority disputes]] for more details.</ref> This theory considered all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it is in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. 
[[Image:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|thumb|180px|1919 solar eclipse]]

Einstein's published papers on general relativity were not available outside of Germany due to the war. News of Einstein's new theory reached English-speaking astronomers in England and America via Dutch physicists Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Paul Ehrenfest and their colleague Willem de Sitter, Director of Leiden Observatory. Arthur Stanley Eddington in England, who was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, asked de Sitter to write a series of articles in English for the benefit of astronomers. He was fascinated with the new theory and became a leading proponent and popularizer of relativity.<ref> Crelinsten, Einstein's Jury, pp. 94-98 </ref> Most astronomers did not like Einstein's geometrization of gravity and believed that his light bending and gravitational redshift predictions would not be correct. In 1917 astronomers at Mt. Wilson Observatory in southern California published results of spectroscopic analysis of the solar spectrum that seemed to indicate that there was no gravitational redshift in the sun. <ref> Crelinsten, pp. 103-108 </ref> In 1918, astronomers at Lick Observatory in northern California obtained photographs at a solar eclipse visible in the United States. After the war ended, they announced results claiming that Einstein's general relativity prediction of light bending was wrong; but they never published their results due to large probable errors. <ref> Crelinsten, pp. 114-119, 126-140. </ref>

During a [[solar eclipse]] in 1919, [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]] supervised measurements of the [[Gravitational lens|bending]] of star light as it passed close to the Sun. This effect is called [[gravitational lensing]] and amounts to twice the Newtonian prediction. The observations were carried out in [[Sobral, Cear<U+00E1>]], [[Brazil]], as well as on the island of [[Principe]], at the west coast of [[Africa]]. Eddington announced that the results confirmed Einstein's prediction and ''[[The Times]]'' reported that confirmation on [[November 7]] of that year, thus cementing Einstein's fame. 

Many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from the scientific (disagreement with Einstein's interpretation of the experiments, belief in the ether or that an absolute frame of reference was necessary) to the psycho-social (conservatism, anti-Semitism). In Einstein's view, most of the objections were from experimentalists with very little understanding of the theory involved.<ref>See esp. Albert Einstein, "My Reply. On the Anti-Relativity Theoretical Co., Ltd. [August 27, 1920," in Klaus Hentschel, ed. ''Physics and National Socialism: An anthology of primary sources'' (Basel: Birkhaeuser, 1996), pp.1-5.</ref> Einstein's public fame which followed the 1919 article created resentment among these scientists some of which lasted well into the 1930s.<ref>There is a good discussion of resentment towards Einstein's fame, especially among those German physicists  who would later start the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' anti-Einsteinian movement, in the Introduction to Klaus Hentschel, ed. ''Physics and National Socialism: An anthology of primary sources'' (Basel: Birkhaeuser, 1996), on p.lxxi. For a discussion of astronomers' attitudes and debates about relativity, see Jeffrey Crelinsten, Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity (Princeton University Press, 2006), esp. chpts. 6, 9, 10 and 11. </ref>

On [[March 30]], [[1921]], Einstein went to [[New York City|New York]] to give a lecture on his new Theory of Relativity, the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Though he is now most famous for his work on relativity, it was for his earlier work on the [[photoelectric effect]] that he was given the Prize, as his work on general relativity was still disputed. The Nobel committee decided that citing his less-contested theory in the Prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community.

===="Copenhagen" interpretation====
[[Image:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] sparred over [[quantum theory]] during the 1920s. Photo taken by [[Paul Ehrenfest]] during their visit to Leiden in December 1925]]

In 1909 Einstein presented a paper ('''<U+00DC>ber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen <U+00FC>ber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''', available in its English translation [[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]) to a gathering of physicists on the history of [[luminiferous aether|aether theories]] and, more importantly, on the quantization of light.  In this and an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that the ''energy'' quanta introduced by [[Max Planck]] also carried a well-defined ''momentum'' and acted in many respects as if they were independent, point-like particles.  This paper marks the introduction of the modern "photon" concept (although the term itself was introduced much later, in a 1926 paper by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]]).  Even more importantly, Einstein showed that light must be ''simultaneously'' a wave and a particle, and foretold correctly that physics stood on the brink of a revolution that would require them to unite these [[wave-particle duality|dual natures]] of light.  However, his own proposal for a solution &mdash; that [[James Maxwell|Maxwell's]] equations for electromagnetic fields be modified to allow wave solutions that are bound to singularities of the field &mdash; was never developed, although it may have influenced [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie's]] [[pilot wave]] hypothesis for [[quantum mechanics]].

In the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of [[quantum mechanics]], Einstein objected to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations. The vast majority see the reason for his objection in terms of the view that he was a rigid determinist (see [[scientific determinism|determinism]]). They would cite a 1926 letter to [[Max Born]], where Einstein made the remark which history recalls the most: "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice."
To this, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], who sparred with Einstein on quantum theory, retorted, "Stop telling God what He must do!" The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the [[Solvay Conference]]s. Another important part of Einstein's viewpoint is the famous 1935 paper ''Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?'' written by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. Most physicists see this as presenting an assumption of determinism.

We might note here that there is more to the story than this. Einstein made further statements beyond that given above, and we have also an interesting comment from his contemporary  Wolfgang Pauli. If we consider these, then it seems the reason Einstein objected to quantum was not an insistence on determinism. The above 'God does not play dice' quotation was something stated quite early, and Einstein's later statements were concerned with other issues. In the 1935 Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen paper, Einstein focusses on the 'incompleteness' of quantum mechanics. Here is what [[John Stewart Bell]] stated regarding this paper: (<ref>reference needed</ref>): "It is important to note that to the limited degree to which determinism plays a role in the EPR argument, it is not assumed but inferred." In the the 1949 ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher and Scientist'' (<ref> ref needed </ref>) we again find Einstein speaking of incompleteness as the diagnosis of quantum's ills, as he did in EPR.

"There is a widespread and erroneous conviction that for Einstein determinism was always the sacred principle. The quotability of his famous `God does not play dice' has not helped in this respect. Among those who had great difficulty seeing Einstein's position was Born. Pauli tried to help in a letter of 1954:  '...I was unable to recognize Einstein whenever you talked about him in either your letter or your manuscript. It seemed to me as if you had erected some dummy Einstein for yourself, which you then knocked down with great pomp. In particular Einstein does not consider the concept of `determinism' to be as fundamental as it is frequently held to be (as he told me emphatically many times) ... he disputes that he uses as a criterion for the admissibility of a theory the question "Is it rigorously deterministic?"... he was not at all annoyed with you, but only said that you were a person who will not listen'...  ...These references to Born are not meant to diminish one of the towering figures of modern physics. They are meant to illustrate the difficulty of putting aside preconceptions and listening to what is actually being said. They are meant to encourage you, dear listener, to listen a little harder." - John S. Bell.

Einstein never rejected probabilistic techniques and thinking, in and of themselves. Einstein himself was a great statistician,<ref>[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3518580 The Economist - Miraculous visions - 100 years of Einstein]</ref> using statistical analysis in his works on Brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before 1905; Einstein had even discovered [[Gibbs ensemble]]s. According to the majority of physicists, however, he believed that indeterminism constituted a criteria for strong objection to a physical theory. Pauli's testimony, as well as at least some of Einstein's own statements, give us a contradictory picture.

More recent times have given us another twist to this business. The same John Stewart Bell has discovered further interesting results ([[Bell's Theorem]] and [[Bell's inequality]]) in his researches on the Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen paper. Again there is a divergence in thinking as to the conclusions derivable from this. Bell himself stated that quantum nonlocality had been established, while others saw the death of determinism.

Whatever his inner convictions, Einstein agreed that the quantum theory was the best available{{citation needed}}, but he looked for a more "complete" explanation, i.e., either more [[scientific determinism|deterministic]] or one that could more fundamentally explain the reason for probabilities in a logical way. He could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things", nor could he abandon the belief that there are no explanations that contain contradictions, which had driven him to his successes explaining photons, relativity, atoms, and gravity.

====Bose-Einstein statistics====

In 1924, Einstein received a short paper from a young [[India]]n physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] describing light as a gas of photons and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication. Einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in [[German language|German]] (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications. [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] now describe any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[boson]]s. The [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] phenomenon was predicted in the 1920s by Bose and Einstein, based on Bose's work on the statistical mechanics of photons, which was then formalized and generalized by Einstein. The first such condensate was produced by [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] in 1995 at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. Einstein's original sketches on this theory were recovered in August 2005 in the library of [[Leiden University]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Einstein archive at the Instituut-Lorentz | url=http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/Einstein_archive/ | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr<U+00F6>dinger]] in the development of the [[quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the Bose-Einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper.

Einstein and former student [[Le<U+00F3> Szil<U+00E1>rd]] co-invented a unique type of [[refrigeration|refrigerator]] (usually called the [[Einstein refrigerator]]) in 1926.<ref>{{cite web | title=Einstein's Refrigerator | url=http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/magazine/sum98/einsrefr.html | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> On [[November 11]], [[1930]], {{US patent|1,781,541}} was awarded to Albert Einstein and Le<U+00F3> Szil<U+00E1>rd. The patent covered a thermodynamic refrigeration cycle providing cooling with no moving parts, at a constant [[pressure]], with only [[heat]] as an input. The refrigeration cycle used [[ammonia]], [[butane]], and [[water (molecule)|water]].

====World War II====
When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in January 1933, Einstein was a guest professor at [[Princeton University]], a position which he took in December 1932, after an invitation from the American educator, [[Abraham Flexner]]. In 1933, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] passed "[[The Law of the Restoration of the Civil Service]]" which forced all Jewish university professors out of their jobs, and throughout the 1930s a campaign to label Einstein's work as "Jewish physics"&mdash;in contrast with "German" or "Aryan physics"&mdash;was led by Nobel laureates [[Philipp Lenard]] and [[Johannes Stark]]. With the assistance of the [[SS]], the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' supporters worked to publish pamphlets and textbooks denigrating Einstein's theories and attempted to politically [[blacklist]] German physicists who taught them, notably [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Einstein renounced his Prussian citizenship and stayed in the [[United States]], where he was given permanent residency. He accepted a position at the newly founded [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in 1940, though he still retained Swiss citizenship.

In 1939, under the encouragement of Szil<U+00E1>rd, Einstein [[Einstein-Szil<U+00E1>rd letter|sent a letter]] to President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] urging the study of [[nuclear fission]] for military purposes, under fears that the Nazi government would be first to develop [[nuclear weapon]]s. Roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein himself did not work on the bomb project, however.

The [[International Rescue Committee]] was founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein to assist opponents of Adolf Hitler.

For more information, see the section below on Einstein's [[#Political views|political views]].

====Institute for Advanced Study====
His work at the Institute for Advanced Study focused on the unification of the [[physical law|laws of physics]], which he referred to as the ''[[Unified Field Theory]]''. He attempted to construct a model which would describe all of the [[fundamental forces]] as different manifestations of a single force. This took the form of an attempt to unify the gravitational and electrodynamic forces, but was hindered because the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s were not understood independently until around 1970, 15 years after Einstein's death. Einstein's goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for [[Grand unification theory|unification of the forces]].

=====Generalized theory===== 
Einstein began to form a [[generalized theory of gravitation]] with the Universal Law of Gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification of the fundamental forces. In 1950 he described his work in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article. Einstein was guided by a belief in a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws. Einstein's Generalized Theory of Gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to field theory. He investigated reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident. 

Einstein postulated a four-dimensional space-time continuum expressed in axioms represented by five component vectors. Particles appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. Einstein treated subatomic particles as objects embedded in the unified field, influencing it and existing as an essential constituent of the unified field but not of it. Einstein also investigated a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields, treating the combination of two parts of the field as being a natural procedure of the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately. He researched a way to delineate the equations and systems to be derived from a [[variational principle]].

Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalized theory of gravitation and was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts. In particular, his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large, most notably the discovery of the [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]].

===Final years===
In 1948, Einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding of [[Brandeis University]]. A portrait of Einstein was taken by [[Yousuf Karsh]] on [[February 11]] of that same year. In 1952, the [[Israel]]i government proposed to Einstein that he take the post of second president. He declined the offer, and is believed to be the only United States citizen ever to have been offered a position as a foreign head of state. On [[March 30]], [[1953]], Einstein released a revised unified [[Field (physics)|field theory]].

He died at 1:15 AM<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/ein.html Neuroscience for Kids - "What Became of Albert Einstein's Brain?"]</ref> in Princeton hospital<ref>[http://www.princetonhistory.org/museum_alberteinstein.cfm Historical Society of Princeton - "Einstein in Princeton"]</ref> in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on [[April 18]], [[1955]] at the age of 76 from internal bleeding, which was caused by the rupture of an [[aortic aneurism]], leaving the [[Generalized Theory of Gravitation]] unsolved. The only person present at his deathbed, a hospital nurse, said that just before his death he mumbled several words in [[German language|German]] that she did not understand. He was [[cremation|cremated]] without ceremony on the same day he died at [[Trenton, New Jersey]], in accordance with his wishes. His ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location. 

An autopsy was performed on Einstein by Dr. [[Thomas Stoltz Harvey]], who removed and preserved [[Albert Einstein's brain|his brain]]. Harvey found nothing unusual with his brain, but in 1999 further analysis by a team at [[McMaster University]] revealed that his parietal [[Operculum (brain)|operculum]] region was missing and, to compensate, his inferior [[parietal lobe]] was 15% wider than normal.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC News : Sci/Tech : Why size mattered for Einstein | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/371698.stm | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> The inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought, visuospatial cognition, and imagery of movement. Einstein's brain also contained 73% more [[glial cells]] than the average brain.

==Personality==
===Religious views===
Einstein was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] beginning in 1934, and was an admirer of [[Ethical Culture]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Humanist Way: An Introduction to Ethical Humanist Religion | url=http://www.aeu.org/ericson2.html | accessdate=February 25 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>  He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Charles Francis Potter | url=http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html | accessdate=May 14 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=May 14 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

'''Quotes on his religious Views'''
:''I came - though the child of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents - to a deep religiousness, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of twelve.''<ref>{{ cite web | title=EinsteinAndReligion.COM/freethink.html | url=http://www.EinsteinAndReligion.COM/freethink.html }}</ref>

:''I do not think that it is necessarily the case that science and religion are natural opposites. In fact, I think that there is a very close connection between the two. Further, I think that science without religion is lame and, conversely, that religion without science is blind. Both are important and should work hand-in-hand.''<ref>Peter A. Bucky, et. al., ''The Private Albert Einstein'' (Kansas City, 1992), p. 85.</ref>

:''A Jew who sheds his faith along the way, or who even picks up a different one, is still a Jew.''<ref>Peter A. Bucky, et. al., ''The Private Albert Einstein'' (Kansas City, 1992), p. 87.</ref>

As an adult, he called his religion a "cosmic religious sense".<ref>{{ cite web | title=EndlessSearch.CO.UK/science_cosmicreligion.htm | url=http://www.EndlessSearch.CO.UK/science_cosmicreligion.htm }}</ref>

In ''The World As I See It'' he wrote:
:''You will hardly find one among the profounder sort of scientific minds without a peculiar religious feeling of his own. But it is different from the religion of the naive man.''

:''For the latter God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one stands to some extent in a personal relation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe.''

:''But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.''<ref>{{ cite web | title=EinsteinAndReligion.COM/sciencereligious.html | url=http://www.EinsteinAndReligion.COM/sciencereligious.html }}</ref>

In response to the telegrammed question of New York's Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein in 1929: "Do you believe in God? Stop. Answer paid 50 words." Einstein replied "I believe in [[Spinoza]]'s God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind."  Note that Einstein replied in only 25 (German) words.  Spinoza was a [[pantheist]].

===Scientific philosophy===

In this respect, Einstein had more in common with "classical" physicists. He rejected the idea of the universe being fundamentally probabilistic, and believed that the Universe was mechanistic and deterministic - his ongoing arguments with [[Quantum mechanics, philosophy and controversy|Heisenberg and Bohr]] are testament to this. Although comfortable with probability, his reasoning was that underlying these phenomena was an essentially deterministic solution.

Einstein wrote: 
:''But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past.''<ref>{{ cite web | title=EinsteinAndReligion.COM/sciencereligious.html | url=http://www.EinsteinAndReligion.COM/sciencereligious.html }}</ref>
and:
:''People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.''<ref>{{ cite web | title=SpeakingOfFaith.PublicRadio.ORG/programs/einsteinsgod/unheardcuts.shtml | url=http://SpeakingOfFaith.PublicRadio.ORG/programs/einsteinsgod/unheardcuts.shtml }}</ref>

Consequently, he felt physical processes determined absolutely everything, including man's desires, see [[Physicalism]]. For example, he said: 
:''I do not believe in freedom of the will. Schopenhauer's words: <U+201C>Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills <U+201D> accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of freedom of will preserves me from taking too seriously myself and my fellow men as acting and deciding individuals and from losing my temper."''<ref>{{ cite web | title=EinsteinAndReligion.COM/credo.html | url=http://www.EinsteinAndReligion.COM/credo.html }}</ref>

Einstein believed true theorists are [[Logical positivism|sober-minded]] [[metaphysics|metaphysicists]], saying:
:''I believe that every true theorist is a kind of tamed metaphysicist, no matter how pure a '[[positivist]]' he may fancy himself. The metaphysicist believes that the logically simple is also the real. The tamed metaphysicist believes that not all that is logically simple is embodied in experienced reality,  but that the totality of all sensory experience can be 'comprehended' on the basis of a conceptual system built on premises of great simplicity."''<ref>{{ cite web | title=leiwen.tripod.com/eingra.htm

===Political views===
[[Image:Mikhoels and Einstein 1943.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Einstein and [[Solomon Mikhoels]], the chairman of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], in 1943.]]

Einstein considered himself a [[pacifism|pacifist]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Einstein : American Museum of Natural History | url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]],<ref>Ibid.</ref> and in later years, a committed [[Social democracy|democratic socialist]]. He once said, ''"I believe [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi's]] views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence for fighting for our cause, but by non-participation of anything you believe is evil."'' Deeply influenced by Gandhi, Einstein once said of Gandhi, "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth." 
Einstein's views were sometimes controversial. In a 1949 article entitled "Why Socialism?",<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Socialism?|first=Albert|last=Einstein|publisher=Monthly Review|date=May 1949|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm|accessdate=2006-01-16}}</ref> Albert Einstein described the "predatory phase of human development", exemplified by a chaotic [[capitalism|capitalist]] society, as a source of evil to be overcome. He disapproved of the [[totalitarian]] regimes in the [[Soviet Union]] and elsewhere, and argued in favor of a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] system which would combine a [[planned economy]] with a deep respect for [[human rights]]. Einstein was a co-founder of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]] and a member of the [[AFL-CIO]]-affiliated union the [[American Federation of Teachers]].

Einstein was very much involved in the [[American Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights movement]]. He was a close friend of [[Paul Robeson]] for over 20 years. Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups (including the Princeton chapter of the [[NAACP]]) many of which were headed by Paul Robeson. He served as co-chair with [[Paul Robeson]] of the ''American Crusade to End Lynching''. When [[W.E.B. DuBois]] was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the McCarthy era while he was in his 80s, Einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case. The case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity. Einstein was quoted as saying that "racism is America's greatest disease". 

The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein ''"believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchism|anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'"'', among other charges. They also alleged that Einstein ''"was a member, sponsor, or affiliated with thirty-four [[communism|communist]] fronts between 1937 and 1954"'' and ''"also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations"''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Federal Bureau of Investigation - Freedom of Information Privacy Act | url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/einstein.htm | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> It should be noted that many of the documents in the file were submitted to the FBI, mainly by civilian political groups, and not actually written by FBI officials.

[[Image:EinsteinSzilard.jpg|thumb|left|222px|In 1939, Einstein signed a letter, written by [[Le<U+00F3> Szil<U+00E1>rd]], to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] arguing that the United States should start funding research into the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s.]]

Einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government, and for this reason (and his Jewish background), opposed the Nazi regime and fled Germany shortly after it came to power. At the same time, Einstein's [[libertarian socialism|anarchist]] nephew [[Carl Einstein]], who shared many of his views, was fighting the fascists in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and even [[Einstein-Szilard letter|sent a letter]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] (dated [[August 2]], [[1939]], before [[World War II]] broke out, and probably written by [[Le<U+00F3> Szil<U+00E1>rd]]) encouraging him to initiate a program to create a nuclear weapon. Roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using [[uranium]] as a weapon, which in a few years was superseded by the [[Manhattan Project]]. 

After the war, though, Einstein lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]]: "I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth<U+2014>rocks!"<ref>Calaprice p. 173. Other versions of the quote exist.</ref>

[[Image:Einstein paper money.jpg|thumb|right|222px|A 5 [[Israeli pound]] note from 1968 with the portrait of Einstein.]]

While Einstein was a supporter of [[Zionism]] in the cultural sense, he often expressed reservations regarding its application in terms of nationalism. During a speech at the Commodore Hotel in New York, he told the crowd "My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain."<ref>[http://www.algemeiner.com/generic.asp?id=454 Algemeiner.com - "The Death of Modern Zionism?", by Simon Jacobson]</ref> He also purchased a full-page ad in the New York Times condemning early Zionists for their treatment of the indigenous Arabs, especially at Deir Yassin ([http://phys4.harvard.edu/~wilson/NYTimes1948.html New York Times ad]). 

Despite these reservations, he was active in the establishment of the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], which published (1930) a volume titled ''About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein'', and to which Einstein bequeathed his papers. In later life, in 1952, he was offered the post of second president of the newly created state of [[Israel]], but declined the offer, saying that he lacked the necessary people skills.  However, Einstein was deeply committed to the welfare of Israel and the Jewish people for the rest of his life.

Albert Einstein was closely associated with plans for what the press called "a Jewish-sponsored non-quota university," from [[August 19]], [[1946]], with the announcement of the formation of the Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, Inc. until [[June 22]], [[1947]], when he withdrew support and barred the use of his name by the foundation. The university opened in 1948 as [[Brandeis University#Origins of Brandeis|Brandeis University]]. 

Einstein, along with [[Albert Schweitzer]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], fought against nuclear tests and bombs. As his last public act, and just days before his death, he signed the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], which led to the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]]. His letter to Russell read:

:''Dear Bertrand Russell,''

::''Thank you for your letter of April&nbsp;5. I am gladly willing to sign your excellent statement. I also agree with your choice of the prospective signers.''

:''With kind regards, A. Einstein''

== Citizenship ==
Einstein was born a [[Germany|German]] citizen. At the age of 17, on [[January 28]], [[1896]], he was released from his German citizenship by his own request and with the approval of his father. He remained [[stateless person|stateless]] for five years. On [[February 21]], [[1901]] he gained [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship, which he never revoked. Einstein obtained Prussian citizenship in [[1914#January-April|April 1914]] when he entered the Prussian civil service, but due to the political situation and the persecution of Jewish people in [[Nazi Germany]], he left civil service in [[1933#March|March 1933]] and thus also lost the Prussian citizenship. On [[1940#September-October|October 1, 1940]], Einstein became an [[United States citizen|American citizen]]. He remained both an American and a Swiss citizen until his death on [[1955#April|April 18, 1955]].

==Popularity and cultural impact==
According to "A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History", he is "the greatest scientist of the twentieth century and one of the supreme intellects of all time".<ref>e.g. {{cite book|title=The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History|first=Michael H.|last=Hart|year=1992|origyear=1978|publisher=Citadel Press|id=ISBN 0806513500}} [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0806513500&id=jvbNRbDKY1wC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&sig=6qINQxp-UvFFdS8A45LNC0noyYk p. 52], "Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist of the twentieth century and one of the supreme intellects of all time..."</ref> Einstein's popularity has also led to widespread use of Einstein's image in [[advertising]] and [[merchandising]], including the registration of "Albert Einstein" as a [[trademark]].

===Entertainment===
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, [[film]]s and plays, including [[Jean-Claude Carrier]]'s 2005 French novel, ''Einstein S'il Vous Plait'' (Please Mr Einstein), [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film ''[[Insignificance (film)|Insignificance]]'', [[Fred Schepisi]]'s film ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' (where he was portrayed by [[Walter Matthau]]), [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel ''Einstein's Dreams'', and [[Steve Martin]]'s comedic play ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]''. He was the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 [[opera]] ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''. His humorous side is also the subject of [[Ed Metzger]]'s one-man play ''[[Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian]]''. 

He is often used as a model for depictions of [[mad scientists]] and [[absent-minded professor]]s in works of fiction; his own character and distinctive hairstyle suggest eccentricity, or even lunacy, and are widely copied or exaggerated. [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine writer Frederic Golden referred to Einstein as "a cartoonist's dream come true."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html TIME 100: Person of the Century - Albert Einstein]</ref> 

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:Einsteinstickingouthistongue.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Einstein sticking out his tongue]]  -->On Einstein's 72nd birthday in 1951, the [[UPI]] photographer Arthur Sasse was trying to coax him into smiling for the camera. Having done this for the photographer many times that day, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead.<ref>{{cite web | title=mental_floss library | url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/archives/archive2003-03-14.htm | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> The image has become an icon in pop culture for its contrast of the genius scientist displaying a moment of levity. [[Yahoo Serious]], an Australian film maker, used the photo as an inspiration for the intentionally anachronistic movie ''[[Young Einstein]]''.

===Speculation and controversy===
There are innumerable speculations which suggest that Einstein was a poor student, a slow learner, or had a form of autism (such as [[High-functioning autism]], or [[Asperger syndrome]]), [[dyslexia]], and/or [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]].  According to the authoritative biography by [[Abraham Pais|Pais]] (page 36, among others), such speculations are unfounded.  Some researchers have periodically claimed otherwise,<ref>See, i.e., ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2988647.stm Einstein and Newton 'had autism']''.</ref> but most historians and doctors are skeptical of retrospective medical diagnoses, especially for complex and, in the case of ADHD, diagnostically-controversial conditions. Examinations of [[Albert Einstein's brain]] after his death have not produced any conclusive evidence of any particular disorder or even significant differences from other human brains.

There is a recurring rumor that Einstein failed mathematics later in his education, but this is untrue; a change in the numbering-system used to record grades may have confused some persons who looked at the records years later. By age 15, Albert Einstein received poor grades in history, languages and geography <ref><u>Encyclopaedia Britannica</u>. 15th edition. Volume 18. "Albert Einstein". Page 155</ref>.

===Personal relations===
Letters written by Einstein to his relatives and kept at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], have revealed that during the course of his life, he had a dozen lovers, two of whom he married.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5168002.stm Letters reveal Einstein love life]'', BBC News (11 July 2006).</ref> Barbara Wolff of the [[Hebrew University]]'s Albert Einstein Archives has made public about 3,500 pages of correspondence including letters to his first and second wives and children between the years 1912-1955. In letters to his second wife Elsa and her daughter Margot he claimed that he had been showered with unwanted attention from women. One of his lovers, a Berlin socialite Ethel Michanowski, "followed me [to England], and her chasing me is getting out of control." His son Eduard's [[schizophrenia]] troubled Einstein greatly, and he often expressed the idea that it would have been better if Eduard had not been born. He adored his stepdaughter and in a letter to Elsa in 1924, he writes: "I love her [Margot] as much as if she were my own daughter, perhaps even more so, since who knows what kind of brat she would have become [had I fathered her]." The letters have been claimed as evidence to dispel myths that Einstein was cold towards his family.

===Licensing===
Einstein bequeathed his estate, as well as the use of his image (see [[personality rights]]), to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web | title=http://aip.org/history/esva/einuse.htm | url=http://aip.org/history/esva/einuse.htm | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> Einstein actively supported the university during his life and this support continues with the [[royalties]] received from licensing activities. [[The Roger Richman Agency]] [[licence]]s the commercial use of the name "Albert Einstein" and associated imagery and likenesses of Einstein, as [[agent (law)|agent]] for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As head licensee the agency can control commercial usage of Einstein's name which does not comply with certain standards (e.g., when Einstein's name is used as a [[trademark]], the <U+2122> symbol must be used).<ref>{{cite web | title=ALBRT EINSTEIN BRAND LOGO | url=http://www.albert-einstein.net/styleguide-readonly/brand.html | accessdate=November 21 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> As of May, 2005, the Roger Richman Agency was acquired by [[Corbis]].
