{{Campaignbox Greco-Persian Wars}}
In the '''Battle of Thermopylae''' of [[480 BC]], an alliance of [[Greeks|Greek]] [[city-state]]s fought the invading [[Persian Empire]] at the pass of [[Thermopylae]] in central [[Greece]].  Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the Persians for three days in one of history's most famous [[last stand]]s.  A small force led by King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] of [[Sparta]] blocked the only road through which the massive army of [[Xerxes I]] of Persia (Xerxes the Great) could pass. After three days of battle, a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] is believed to have betrayed the Greeks by revealing a goat path that led behind the Greek lines.

The Greeks were represented by "three hundred Spartan armed men; one thousand from [[Tegea]] and [[Mantinea]], half from each place; one hundred and twenty from [[Orchomenus]] in [[Arcadia]] and one thousand from the rest of Arcadia; that many Arcadians, four hundred from [[Corinth]], two hundred from [[Phlius]], and eighty [[Mycenae|Mycenaeans]]. These were the [[Peloponnesus|Peloponnesians]] present; from [[Boeotia]] there were seven hundred [[Thespiae|Thespians]] and four hundred [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]]."<ref name="vii-202">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.202 VII, 202]</ref> In the final battle, when it became clear that the Persians were going to win, most of the Greek allies retreated but Leonidas and 300 Spartan soldiers stayed to fight. Though they "knew that they must die at the hands of [the Persians], they displayed the greatest strength they had."<ref name="vii-223">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.223.1 VII, 223]</ref>

The Persians succeeded in taking the pass but sustained heavy losses, extremely disproportionate to those of the Greeks. The fierce resistance of the [[Sparta]]n-led army offered [[Athens]] the invaluable time to prepare for a decisive [[naval battle]] that would come to determine the outcome of the war.<ref name="russel">{{Citation |last=Bury |first=J.

The Spartans assembled at full strength and led a pan-Greek army that defeated the Persians decisively at the [[Battle of Plataea]], ending the [[Greco-Persian War]] and with it the expansion of the [[Persian Empire]] into [[Europe]].

==Greek preparations==
The Battle of Thermopylae was the first main event in what is generally termed the Second Persian War. Its political origin is to be found in the events of the First Persian War,<ref>A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of these historial terms may be found in {{cite book | first=Nick | last=Sekunda | title=Marathon 490 Bc: The First Persian Invasion of Greece | pages=page 7 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | date=2002 | id=ISBN 1841760005}}</ref> when Xerxes' father, King [[Darius I of Persia]], or Darius the Great, invaded Greece for the first time and was defeated by [[Athens]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. Just prior to that battle Darius had sent heralds around to the Greek states offering the opportunity to submit,<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23950;loc=6.48.1 VI, 48]</ref> which would avoid war and make them eligible for [[Wiktionary:blandishments|blandishments]] from the king. As was customary, this was signaled by asking for "[[earth and water]]", betokening their submission, which was duly kept by the assiduous bureaucrats of the Persian Empire. The Athenians responded at that time by throwing the emissaries into pit, and the Spartans by throwing others  into a well, with a suggestion to dig it out for themselves.<ref name="vii-133">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.133.1 VII, 133]</ref>

Consequently when Xerxes sent the envoys around again<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.32.1 VII, 32]</ref> just prior to the Battle of Thermopylae he omitted Athens and Sparta. Support gathered around these two leading states. A congress met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of [[481 BC]],<ref name="vii-145">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.145.1 VII,145]. He does not use the term "congress" or any ancient equivalent. He only says that they exchanged pledges and consulted together.</ref> and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. [[Herodotus]] does not formulate an abstract name for the polity, such as "congress" or "alliance", but calls them simply "{{Unicode|<U+03BF><U+1F31>  <U+1F1D><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2>}}" (the Greeks) and "the Greeks who had sworn alliance" (Godley translation) or "the Greeks who had banded themselves together" (Rawlinson translation).<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.148.1 VII, 148]</ref> Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress<ref name="vii-160">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.161.1 VII, 161]</ref> but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy. Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussion during its proceedings. Only 70 of the approximately 700 Greek cities sent representatives.

The Persian army first encountered a joint force of 10,000 Athenian and Spartan [[hoplite]]s led by Euanetus and [[Themistocles]] in the [[vale of Tempe]]. Upon hearing this, Xerxes sent the army through the Sarantaporo strait, which was unguarded, and sidestepped them. The hoplites, warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]], vacated the pass.<ref name="vii-173">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.173.1 VII,173]</ref> The allied Greeks judged that the next strategic [[choke point]] where the Persian force could be stopped was [[Thermopylae]].<ref name="vii-175">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.175.1 VII,175]</ref> They decided to defend it and send a fleet to [[Artemision]], a naval choke point, as Xerxes' army was being supplied and supported by sea. Using the fleet, Xerxes' army might have crossed Maliacos bay and outflanked the Greek army again.<ref name=IEE>Despotopoulos, <U+0399><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03CD> <U+0388><U+03B8><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C2> (History of the Greek Nation) volume B</ref>

The Greek high strategy is confirmed by an oration later in the same century:

<blockquote>But while Greece showed these inclinations <nowiki>[to join the Persians]</nowiki>, the Athenians, for their part, embarked in their ships and hastened to the defence of Artemisium; while the Spartans and some of their allies went off to make a stand at Thermopylae, judging that the narrowness of the ground would enable them to secure the passage.<ref>[[Lysias]], Funeral oration 30, translated by W.R.M. Lamb, M.A.</ref></blockquote>

Some modern historians, such as Bengtson,<ref>{{cite book |last=Bengtson |first=Hermann |title=Griechische Geschichte von den Anf<U+00E4>ngen bis in die r<U+00F6><U+0308>mische Kaiserzeit |year=1969 |publisher=Beck |location=Munich |id= }}</ref> claim that the purpose of the [[Army|land force]] was to slow down the Persian army whilst the Persian navy was defeated at sea. Another theory is that the land army was expected to hold back the Persian forces in the north and defeat it through attrition, epidemics, and food deprivation.<ref name=IEE/>

Historians have also argued that the Athenians were confident that a small Greek force led by Leonidas would be enough to hold back the Persians; otherwise, they would have already vacated their city and sent their whole army to Thermopylae.<ref name=IEE/> There is one known case in which a small force did stop a larger invading force from the north: in [[353 BC]]/[[352 BC]] the Athenians managed to stop the forces of [[Philip II of Macedon]] by deploying 5,000 hoplites and 400 horsemen.<ref name="ds1638">[[Diodorus Siculus]] book 16 chapter 38</ref>

Herodotus writes:
<blockquote>The force with Leonidas was sent forward by the Spartans in advance of their main body, that the sight of them might encourage the allies to fight, and hinder them from going over to the [[Medes]], as was likely they might have done had they seen that Sparta was backward. They intended presently, when they had celebrated the [[Carneia]]n Festival, which was what now kept them at home, to leave a garrison in Sparta, and hasten in full force to join the army. The rest of the allies intended to act similarly; for it happened that the [[Olympic Games|Olympic Festival]] fell exactly at this same period. None of them looked to see the contest at Thermopylae decided so speedily; wherefore they were content to send forward a mere advance guard. Such accordingly were the intentions of the allies.<ref name="vii-206">Herodotus VII.206 entire.</ref></blockquote>

The legend of Thermopylae as told by Herodotus has it that Sparta consulted the [[Oracle at Delphi|Oracle]] at [[Delphi]] before setting out to meet the Persian army. [[Oracle at Delphi|The Oracle]] is said to have made the following [[prophecy]] in [[hexameter]] verse:<ref name="vii-242">{{cite web | last=Herodotus | authorlink=Herodotus | coauthors=[[George Rawlinson]] (Translator) | title=The History of Herodotus: Polymnia | work=Greek Texts | publisher=Greek-Texts.com & Greece Http Ltd. | date=2005 | pages=page 50 |url=http://www.greektexts.com/library/Herodotus/Polymnia/eng/242.html | format=html | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>
<blockquote>
O ye men who dwell in the streets of broad [[Lacedaemon]]! <br>
Either your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of [[Persia]], <br>
Or, in exchange, must all through the whole Laconian country <br>
Mourn for the loss of a king, descendant of great [[Heracles]].	<br>
He cannot be withstood by the courage of bulls nor of lions, <br>
Strive as they may; he is mighty as [[Jove]]; there is naught that shall stay him,<br>	 
Till he have got for his prey [[Kings of Sparta|your king]], or your glorious city.</blockquote>	 
In essence, the Oracle's warning was that either Sparta would be conquered and left in ruins or one of her [[Sparta#Constitution|two hereditary kings]], descendant of Heracles, must sacrifice his life to defend her.

Leonidas took charge of his personal fighting unit, the 300 Spartans (and the 900 [[helots]]), and headed to Thermopylae.<ref name="vii-204">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin///ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.204.1 VII.204]</ref> Herodotus writes that Leonidas was idolized by his men. He was convinced that he was going to certain death and his forces were not adequate for a victory, and so selected only men who had fathered sons who were old enough to take over the family responsibilities. [[Plutarch]] mentions in his ''Sayings of Spartan Women'' that, after encouraging him, Leonidas' wife [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] asked what she should do on his departure. He replied, "Marry a good man, and have good children."<ref>''Lacaenarum apophthegmata'', Plutarch.</ref>

== Battle ==

===Arrival of the Persians===
Herodotus attests a conversation that took place early in the expedition between Xerxes and [[Demaratus]], an exiled Spartan king under his employment.  Xerxes asked Demaratus whether he thought that the Greeks would put up a fight, for in his opinion neither the Greeks nor even all peoples of Europe together would be able to stop him because they were disunited.<ref name=VII>Herodotus, Hist. VII</ref> Demaratus replied:<blockquote> First then, no matter what, the Spartans will never accept your terms. This would reduce Greece to slavery. They are sure to join battle with you even if all the rest of the Greeks surrendered to you. As for Spartan numbers, do not ask how many or few they are, hoping for them to surrender. For if a thousand of them should take the field, they will meet you in battle, and so will any other number, whether it is less than this, or more.</blockquote>
Xerxes laughed at this answer, claiming that "free men" of any number would never be able to stand against his army which was unified by a single ruler, and that obedience to one single master would make his troops extremely courageous, or they would be led into battle "by the whip" even against an army of any size.<ref name=VII/> He added that "even if the Greeks have larger numbers than our highest estimate, we still would outnumber them 100 to 1", claiming that his army too contained men as tough as the ones Demaratus had described even though the deployment of the [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] didn't allow a pushing match to be initiated. <ref name=VII/>

On the [[Persian Empire]] army's arrival at Thermopylae, Greek troops instigated a council meeting. Some [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]] suggested withdrawal to the [[Isthmus of Corinth|Isthmus]] and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus. They were well aware that the Persians would have to go through [[Athens]] in order to reach them there. The [[Phocians]] and [[Locrians]], whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas and the Spartans agreed to defend Thermopylae.<ref name=VII/>

Meanwhile, the Persians entered the pass and sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. When the scout reported to Xerxes the size of the Greek force and that the Spartans were indulging in [[calisthenics]] and combing their long hair, Xerxes found the reports laughable. Seeking again the counsel of Demaratus, Xerxes was told that the Spartans were preparing for battle and that it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them "the bravest men in Greece" and warned the Great King that they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the King had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, no other nation in the world would dare to defend themselves against him.<ref name=VII/> 

Xerxes remained incredulous, finding it unbelievable for such a small army to contend with his own. Plutarch informs that he then sent emissaries to the Greek forces. At first, he asked Leonidas to join him by offering the kingship of all Greece. Leonidas answered: "If you knew what is good in life, you would abstain from wishing for foreign things. For me it is better to die for Greece than to be monarch over my compatriots."<ref>(Plutarch, Moralia, 225, 10)</ref>

Despite their extremely disproportionate numbers, Greek morale was high. Herodotus writes that when [[Dienekes]], a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian  arrows would be so numerous as "''to blot out the sun''", he responded with a characteristically [[laconic phrase|laconic]] remark, "''So much the better, we shall fight in the shade.''"<ref>Herodotus VII, 226. "In the shade" was taken by the [[Hellenic Army XX Armored Division]] as their motto.</ref>

Xerxes waited four days for the Greek force to disperse. On the fifth day he sent [[Medes]] and [[Cissia]]ns, along with relatives of those who had died 10 years earlier in the [[battle of Marathon]] to take the Greeks prisoner and bring them before him.<ref name="vii-210">Herodotus VII,210</ref><ref name="ds964">[[Diodorus Siculus]], Library, XI,6,4</ref> According to [[Ctesias]], the first wave numbered 10,000 soldiers and were commanded by [[Artapanus (General)|Artapanus]]. They were "cut to pieces" with only two or three Spartans dead.<ref name=CP>Photius, Myriobiblon code 72: Ctesias Persica par. 26 </ref>

===Failure of the frontal assault===
On [[August 18]], [[480]] B.C.<ref name="riseandfall">''The Rise and Fall of the Spartans'', History International cable TV network, viewed August 21, 2007</ref>, Xerxes sent in the [[Medes]] who had been only recently conquered by the Persians, perhaps, as [[Diodorus Siculus]] suggested, because he wanted them to bear the brunt of the fighting.<ref name="ds963">[[Diodorus Siculus]], Library, XI,6,3</ref> The Medes soon found themselves in a [[frontal assault]]. The Greeks had camped on either side of the rebuilt Phocian wall. That the wall was guarded shows that the Greeks were using it to establish a reference line for the battle, but they fought in front of it.<ref name="vii-208">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.208.1 VII, 208]</ref>

Details of the tactics are scant. The Greeks probably deployed in a [[phalanx formation|phalanx]], a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points, spanning the width of the pass since attacking individually would have left the Spartan warriors vulnerable to Persian arrows. Herodotus says that the units for each state were kept together.<ref name="vii-204" /> The Persians, armed with arrows and short spears, could not break through the long spears of the Greek phalanx, nor were their lightly armored men a match for the superior armor, weaponry, and strategy of the Greek [[hoplites]]. <ref name="ds117">[[Diodorus Siculus]], Library, XI,7</ref> Glotz has argued that three [[Persian Empire]] soldiers were necessary to put down one hoplite.<ref> Glotz G., Roussel P., Cohen R., Histoire Grecque vol. I-IV, Paris 1948 </ref> In this way they killed so many Medes that Xerxes is said to have started up off the seat from which he was watching the battle three times.<ref name="vii-212">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.212.1 VII, 212]</ref>

According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the Persian emperor, having taken the measure of the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault: the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]], an elite corps of 10,000 men.<ref name="ds117" /><ref name="vii-211">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.211.1 VII, 211]</ref> However, according to Ctesias, the Immortals did not attack until the second day. Ctesias tells that Xerxes sent another 20,000 troops against the Greeks, after the first 10,000 were defeated, who also failed to open the pass even though they were flogged by their leaders to press on.<ref name=CP/> On his side, Leonidas had arranged a system of relays between the hoplites of the various cities so as to constantly have fresh troops on the front line. In the heat of the battle, however, the units did not get a chance to rotate. Able to approach the Greek line only in such numbers as the space allowed, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and Xerxes had to withdraw them as well. The first day of battle probably ended there.<ref name="ds117" />

On the second day Xerxes sent, according to Ctesias, another 50,000 men to assault the pass, but again they failed. The account of the slain gives some indication why: the wall of bodies must have broken up the Persian line and detracted from their morale. Climbing over the bodies, they could see that they had stepped into a killing machine but the officers behind prevented them from withdrawing. Xerxes at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, totally perplexed. By now he concluded that a head-on confrontation against Spartan-led troops in a narrow place was the wrong approach.<ref name =CP/>

===Encirclement of the Greeks===
Late on the second day of battle, as the Persian king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall: a [[Malians (Greek tribe)|Malian]] Greek traitor named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] informed him of a path around Thermopylae and offered to guide the Persian army through the pass. Ephialtes was motivated by the desire of a reward. For this act, the name of Ephialtes received a lasting stigma, coming to mean "nightmare" and becoming the archetypal term for a "traitor" in Greek.<ref>Tegopoulos-Fytrakis dictionary of [[modern Greek]], word:<U+0395><U+03C6><U+03B9><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2></ref>   

Xerxes sent his commander [[Hydarnes]] through the pass with the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]] and other troops (a force of about 40,000), according to Ctesias.<ref name=CP/>   The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Gulf of Malis at Alpenus, first town of [[Locris]]. Leonidas had stationed 1,000 [[Phocis|Phocian]] volunteers on the heights to guard that path.<ref name="vii-217">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.217.1 VII, 217]</ref>

Their first warning of the approach of the Immortals was the rustling of oak leaves at first light on the third day of the battle. Herodotus says that they jumped up and were greatly amazed.<ref name="vii-218">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.218.1 VII, 218]</ref> Hydarnes was perhaps as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and the Persian forces. He feared that they were Spartans, but was enlightened by Ephialtes and proceeded by firing "showers of arrows" at them. The Phocians retreated to the crest of the mountain to make their stand, but the Persians took the left branch of the pass to Alpenus and hence circled behind the main Greek force.<ref name="vii-218" />

===Last stand of the Spartans, Thespians and Thebans===
Before first light on [[August 20]], [[480]] B.C.E.<ref name="riseandfall" />, Leonidas learned that the Phocians had not held and he called a [[council of war]] at dawn. During the council some Greeks argued for withdrawal in the face of the overwhelming Persian advance, while others pledged to stay. After the council, many of the Greek forces did choose to withdraw. Herodotus believed that Leonidas blessed their departure with an order, but he also offered the alternative point of view that those retreating forces departed without orders.<ref name="vii-219220">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.219.1 VII, 219]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.220.1 220]</ref> The Spartans had pledged themselves to fight to the death, while the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] were held as hostage against their will. However, a contingent of about 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], led by general [[Demophilus]], the son of Diadromes, refused to leave with the other Greeks, but cast their lot with the Spartans.<ref name="vii-222">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.222.1 VII, 222]</ref> Unknown and unremembered by most, 900 Laconian [[Helots]] (serfs of the Spartan state) also died fighting in the last stand.<ref name=Green/>

Ostensibly, the Spartans were obeying their oath and following the oracle of Delphi (see below). However, it might also have been a calculated strategy to delay the advance of the Persians and cover the retreat of the Greek army. Once the pass was cleared the Persians could use their cavalry to pursue and stop  the retreat of the Greek infantry in the more open terrain. The heavily armed Greek infantry could not have outrun Persia's cavalry; once halted in the open, the Greeks could be overwhelmed by superior numbers and a cavalry charge. In fact, with the Persians so close at hand, the decision to stand and fight was probably a tactical requirement only made more palatable by the oracle.<ref name=IEE/> At dawn Xerxes made libations, pausing to allow the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]] sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance.<ref name="vii-223">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.223.1 VII, 223]</ref><!--come up with the source of the story and put this paragraph back in without the citeneeded: The significance of the Thespians' refusal to leave should not be ignored. The Spartans, as brave as their sacrifice indubitably was, were professional soldiers, trained from birth to be ready to give their lives in combat as [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Spartan law]] dictated. Conversely, the Thespians were citizen-soldiers (Demophilus, for example, made his living as an architect) who elected to add whatever they could to the fight, rather than allow the Spartans to be annihilated alone. Though their bravery is often overlooked by history, it was most certainly not overlooked by the Spartans, who are said to have exchanged cloaks with the Thespians and promised to be allies for eternity.{{cn|date=March 2007}}-->

The Greeks this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass in an attempt to slaughter as many Persians as they could.  They fought with spears until every spear was shattered and then switched to [[xiphos|xiphoi]] (short swords). In this struggle, Herodotus states that two brothers of Xerxes fell: [[Abrocomes]] and [[Hyperanthes]]. Leonidas also died in the assault.<ref name="vii-224">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.224.1 VII, 224]</ref>

Receiving intelligence that Ephialtes and the Immortals were advancing toward the rear, the Greeks withdrew and took a stand on a small hill behind the wall. The Thebans "moved away from their companions, and with hands upraised, advanced toward the barbarians ..." (Rawlinson translation), but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted.<ref name="vii-233">Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.233.1 VII 233]</ref> "Here they defended themselves to the last, such as still had swords using them, and the others resisting with their hands and teeth; ...."<ref name="vii-225">Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.225.1 VII, 225]</ref> Tearing down part of the wall, Xerxes ordered the hill surrounded and the Persians rained down arrows until the last Greek was dead.<ref name="vii-225"/> Modern archaeologists have found evidence of the final arrow shower.<ref>Reed College's [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/Thermopylae.html Thermopylae] describes the excavations by [[Spyridon Marinatos]].</ref>

==Aftermath==
When the body of [[Leonidas]] was recovered by the Persians, Xerxes, in a rage at the loss of so many of his soldiers, ordered that the head be cut off and the body [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Herodotus observes that this was very uncommon for the Persians, as they had the habit of treating enemies that fought bravely against them with great honor<ref name="vii-238">Herodotus VII,238</ref> (the example of Pytheas captured earlier off [[Skyros]] also suggests that<ref name="vii-181">See Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.181.1 VII,181]</ref>). However, Xerxes was known for his rage, as when he had the [[Hellespont]] whipped because it would not obey him.<ref name="vii-35">Herodotus 7.35.</ref>

Xerxes was curious as to why there was such a small Greek force guarding Thermopylae and interrogated some Arcadian prisoners. The answer was that all the other men were participating in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], a very important event for them. When Xerxes asked what the prize for the winner was, "an olive-wreath" came the answer. Upon hearing this, Tritantaechmes, a Persian general, said to [[Mardonius]]: "Good heavens! Mardonius, what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for money, but for honor".<ref name="viii-26">Herodotus, VIII, 26</ref>

After the Persians' departure, the defeated Greeks collected their dead and buried them on the hill. A stone lion was erected to commemorate Leonidas. Forty years after the battle, Leonidas' bones were returned to Sparta where he was buried again with full honors and funeral games were held every year in his memory.<ref>Pausanias 3.14.1</ref>

The simultaneous naval [[Battle of Artemisium]] was a stalemate, whereupon the Athenian navy retreated. The Persians were now in control of the [[Aegean Sea]] and all of peninsular Greece as far south as [[Attica, Greece|Attica]]. The Spartans prepared to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and the [[Peloponnese]], while Xerxes went on to sack [[Athens]], whose inhabitants had already fled to the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. In September, the Greeks defeated the Persians at the naval [[Battle of Salamis]], which led to the rapid retreat of Xerxes. The remaining Persian army, left under the charge of [[Mardonius]], was defeated in the [[Battle of Plataea]] by a combined Greek army again led by the Spartans, under the regent Pausanias.<ref name="ix">Herodotus book IX</ref>
<!--The battle can be used to illustrate a lot of things, but this article is about the battle, not the subsequent classroom speeches on it. As for it being regarded as anything, why don't we leave it up to the reader to do the regarding?: This battle, along with [[Sogdian Rock]] and similar actions, is used in [[military academy|military academies]] around the world to show how a small group of well-trained and well-led soldiers can have an impact out of all proportion to their numbers. It is worth noting also that the effectiveness of the Greeks against such a vastly larger army was due in large part to the battlefield itself. Had this battle been fought on an open field, rather than a narrow pass, the smaller Greek army could have been surrounded and defeated with ease, despite the quality of the Greek infantry. Thus Thermopylae is also regarded as being as much a lesson in the importance of favorable terrain and good strategy as it is in good training and discipline.-->

== Topography of the battlefield ==
At the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Gulf of Malis so narrow that only one chariot could pass through.<ref name="vii-176" /> On the southern side of the track stood the cliffs, while on the north side was the gulf. Along the path was a series of three constrictions, or "gates" (pylai), and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the [[Phocians]] in the previous century to aid in their defense against [[Thessalian]] invasions.<ref name="vii-176">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.176.1 VII,176]</ref> The name "hot gates" comes from the [[hot spring]]s that were located there.

Today, the pass is not near the sea but is inland due to infilling of the Gulf of Malis. The old track appears at the foot of hills around the plain, flanked by a modern road. Recent [[core sample]]s indicate that the pass was only 100 m. wide and the waters came up to the gates. Says Lyn Dore: "Little do the visitors realize that the battle took place across the road from the monument."<ref>{{Citation | first=Lyn | last=Dore  | editor-last=Freeman | editor-first=P.W.M. | editor2-last=Pollard | editor2-first=A. | contribution=Once the War Is Over | title=Fields of Conflict: Progress and Prospect in Battlefield Archaeology | year=2001 | pages=pages 285-286 | publisher=David Brown Book Co. | id=ISBN 9781841712499}}. The article can be viewed at [http://humanitieslab.stanford.edu/contemporaryarchaeology/admin/download.html?attachid=472185]</ref> The pass still is a natural defensive position to modern armies.

== Size of the Persian army ==
===Primary sources===
In [[480 BC]], the Persian army and navy arrived at Doriscus in [[Thrace]]. A bridge of ships had been made at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]]. This allowed the land forces to cross the [[Hellespont]]. At Doriscus [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] conducted a review and a count of his army and navy, which was recorded by the Persian scribes. [[Herodotus]] must have had some sort of knowledge of this account, as he lists and describes the units and gives the size of Xerxes' combined forces as follows:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
!'''Units'''

|-

|- style="background:lightgrey;"
| Total
| 2,641,610

This number is doubled in order to account for support personnel and thus Herodotus reports that the total Persian force numbered 5,283,220 men.<ref name="vii-186">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.186.1 VII,186]</ref> The poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], who was a contemporary, talks of three million combatants.<ref name="vii-228"/> One century later, [[Ctesias|Ctesias of Cnidus]] gives 800,000 as the total number of the army that met in Doriscus.<ref>{{cite web | last=Ctesias | authorlink=Ctesias | coauthors=J.H.

===Modern estimates===
Modern scholars have given different estimates based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army's route. An early and very influential modern, [[George Grote]], set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by [[Herodotus]]:<ref>{{cite book | first=George | last=Grote | authorlink=George Grote | title=A History of Greece: Part II: Chapter XXXVIII From the Battle of Marathon to the March of Xerxes Against Greece}} Throughout the decades many editions of Grote have been published. The page numbers depend on the edition. However, Grote used top-of-page captions instead of subsections. The presentation on the size of Xerxes' army is to be found under "Muster of the Army of Xerxes."</ref> "To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible." Grote's main objection is the supply problem, but he nowhere states any measure of supply capability nor did he have available any scientific data on the topic. He does not reject Herodotus altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years. He points to the contradictions in the ancient estimates and refrains from making one of his own or implying that such an estimate is possible. It was up to subsequent scholars to make them.

A pivotal study of the 20th century by [[John Frederick Maurice|Major-General Sir John Frederick Maurice]] focuses on the water supply.<ref name=Maurice>{{cite journal | last=Maurice | first=F. | authorlink=John Frederick Maurice | year=1930 | title=The size of the army of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in the invasion of Greece 480 B.C. | journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] | volume=50 | pages=pages 210<U+2013>235}} Most readers will not have free access to this article, but discussion of it can be found in nearly every modern book on the Battle of Thermopylae; for example, Bradford page 34, or {{cite book | first=N.B. | last=Fischer | coauthors=Ilya Gershevitch; Ehsan Yarshster (Editors) | title=The Cambridge History of Iran  | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=1993 | id=ISBN 0521200911 | pages=page 320}}</ref> A former British transport officer himself, he had access to the British Admiralty handbook containing data on the rivers of Greece. Calculating that a force of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals would strain the water resources, and noting that Herodotus reports those resources were strained,<ref>Herodotus VII, 21 "Was there a river ... which sufficed for his troops to drink?"</ref> he suggests that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for ''chiliarchy'' (1,000) and ''myriarchy'' (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten. He therefore modifies Herodotus' figure for land combatants only to about 210,000 men, 75,000 animals.<ref name=cch>{{cite book | first=Carolyn | last=Dewald | coauthors=John Marincola | title=The Cambridge companion to Herodotus | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2006 | id=ISBN 052183001X | pages=page 217}}</ref> This does not include support personnel.

The topic has been controversial but modern estimates for the land force figures range from 60,000 to 300,000,<ref>Thomas Kelly ([[University of Minnesota]]) (2003). "Persian Propaganda - A Neglected Factor in Xerxes' Invasion of Greece and Herodotus", ''Iranica Antiqua'' '''38''', p. 198.</ref> though higher and lower estimates have been suggested by several scholars,<ref name=Stecchini>Stecchini under External links below.</ref> but more popular views support ranges between 100,000-150,000 or 150,000-200,000.<ref name=souza/> All these estimates concern the land forces alone, whereas the entire Persian presence in Greece, including support troops and fleet crew, would almost double the number.<ref name=cch/>

The numbers given by Herodotus on the Persian fleet are considered largely realistic. It is generally maintained that Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition,<ref name=souza>{{ cite book | title=The Greek and Persian Wars, 499-386 BC | first=Philip | last=de Souza | pages=page 41 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | date=2003 | id=ISBN 1-84176-358-6}}</ref> and it is more likely the numbers on the fleet were given precisely, whereas the contingent of the army may have been listed in general terms rather than exact figures.<ref name=souza/> Whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.<ref name=souza/>

== Size of the Greek army ==
According to Herodotus,<ref name="vii-202203">Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.202.1 VII, 202] and also 203.</ref> the Greek army included the following forces:

To this number must be added 1,000 other [[Laconia|Lacedemonians]] (Spartan Hoplites) mentioned by [[Diodorus Siculus]]<ref name="ds115">[[Diodorus Siculus]], book XI,5</ref> and perhaps 800 auxiliary troops from other Greek cities, bringing the total up to 7,000. A further 900 [[Helots]] (Spartan serfs) also fought at the battle. Diodorus gives 4,000 as the total of Greek troops, while [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] gives 11,200.<ref>Pausanias 10,20,2</ref> Many modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable, prefer his claim of 7,000 men. The numbers changed later on in the battle as, under orders, the entire army retreated and only 2,000 Spartans, Helots, Thespians and Thebans remained.<ref name=Green/>

===Epitaph of Simonides===
[[Image:Thermopiles memorial epitaph.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Epitaph with Simonides' epigram]]

[[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] composed a well-known [[epigram]], which was engraved as an [[epitaph]] on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae. It is also the hill on which the last of them died.<ref name="vii-228">Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=7.228.1 VII, 228]</ref> The original stone has not been preserved.

===Leonidas monument===
[[Image:Leonidas monument.jpg|thumb|right|Leonidas Monument.]]Additionally, there is a modern monument at the site, called the "Leonidas Monument" in honour of the Spartan king. It features a bronze statue of Leonidas. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: "[[Molon labe|<U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03CE><U+03BD> <U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B2><U+03AD>]]" ("Come and get them!"). The metope below depicts battle scenes. The two marble statues on the left and the right of the monument, represent respectively the river [[Eurotas River|Eurotas]] and the mount [[Taygetos]], hallmarks of [[Sparta]].

===Thespians monument=== 	 
[[Image:Thespians monument full.jpg|thumb|right|Thespians' Monument.]]
In 1997, a second monument was officially unveiled by the Greek government, dedicated to the 700 Thespians who fought with the Spartans. The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], who was worshiped in ancient Thespiae. Under the statue, a sign reads "In memory of the seven hundred Thespians". 	 
 		 
A plate, below the statue, explains its symbolism : 	 
* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country. 	 
* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage. 	 
* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom. 	 
* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death. 	 
* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, the god of creation, beauty and life. 	 
	 
The monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.

A more serious aspect has been its [[didactic]] use. Scarcely a [[book]] or [[Article (publishing)|article]] on military topics fails to mention and comment on the battle.

{{main|Sparta in popular culture}}
Prior to the battle, the [[Hellenes]] remembered the [[Dorians]], an ethnic distinction to which the [[Spartans]] belonged, as the conquerors and displacers of the [[Ionians]] in the [[Peloponnesus]]. After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation and has been so ever since.
