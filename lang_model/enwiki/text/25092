According to the [[United States Office of Government Ethics]], a '''political appointee''' is <U+201C>any employee who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], or agency head.<U+201D>
In the United States, political appointees are subject to heavy ethical restrictions, more so than their elected counterparts.
One of these restrictions requires political appointees to take an ethics pledge, which includes a pledge to not accept gifts from lobbyists or lobbying organizations. This is because of Executive Order 13490 Under Section 102 of Executive Order 12674, political appointees who are appointed by the president are not allowed to receive any income from outside employment or activities.<ref name="oge">{{cite web|title=Political Appointees|url=http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|publisher=U.S. Office of Government Ethics|accessdate=11/11/2013}}</ref>
Exceptions to the rule are:
* 	a position filled under the authority of 3 U.S.C. <U+00A7> 105 or 3 U.S.C. <U+00A7> 107(a) for which the rate of basic pay is less than that for GS-9, step 1 of the [[General Schedule]].
* 	a position, within a [[White House]] operating unit, that is designated as not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition
* 	a position within the [[Uniformed Services]].
* 	a position in which a member of the [[U.S. Foreign Service]] is serving that does not require advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

== History ==

=== United States ===

In the politics of the United States, the system of political appointments comes from a history of the [[spoils system]] (also known as a [[patronage system]]) which is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory. The term was derived from the phrase "to the victor belong the spoils" by New York Senator [[William L. Marcy]], referring to the victory of the Jackson Democrats in the election of 1828, with the term spoils meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory. Though it is commonly assumed that the patronage system in the United States first came into general use during [[Andrew Jackson]]'s presidency. It actually has an older history. President [[Thomas Jefferson]], a [[Democratic-Republican]], favored a policy of keeping rival [[Federalists]] out of government offices. 

The patronage system thrived in the U.S. federal government until 1883. In 1820 [[Congress]] limited federal administrators to four-year terms, leading to constant turnover. And by the 1860's and [[the Civil War]], patronage had led to widespread inefficiency and political corruption. Where patronage had once been confined to the cabinet, department heads, and foreign ambassadorships, by the 1860's low-level government positions were subject to patronage. The loss of a presidential election by a political party signaled wholesale turnover in the federal government. It took the assassination of President [[James Garfield]] in 1881 by a disgruntled office seeker who did not receive a political appointment<ref name=penl>http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=145</ref> to spur Congress to pass the [[Civil Service Act]], or Pendleton Act of 1883.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patronage|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/lib/student_work/florence96/jessdave/patronage.html|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=11/11/2013}}</ref>  This act, which at the time only applied to 10 percent of the federal workforce, created a [[Civil Service Commission]] and advocated a [[merit system]] for the selection of government employees.  In addition, the passage in 1939 the [[Hatch Act]], forbade the intimidation or bribery of voters and restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. It prohibited using any public funds designated for relief or public works for electoral purposes. It forbade officials paid with federal funds from using promises of jobs, promotion, financial assistance, contracts, or any other benefit to coerce campaign contributions or political support. Which restricted most partisan political activities of federal employees. By 1980, 90 percent of federal positions had become part of the civil service system. Which lead to state and local governments to employed large patronage systems. Big-city political machines in places such as [[New York]], [[Boston]], and [[Chicago]] thrived in the late nineteenth century. Being as a patronage system not only rewarded political supporters for past support, it also encouraged future support, because persons who have a patronage job would try to retain it by campaigning for the party at the next election. Large-scale patronage systems declined steadily during the twentieth century. During the [[Progressive Era]] (1900<U+2013>1920), "good government" reformers overthrew political machines and installed civil service systems. Chicago, under Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], remained the last bastion of patronage, existing in its purest form until the late 1970's.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anti- Corruption Report|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/pols/ChicagoPolitics/AntiCorruptionReport_4.pdf|accessdate=11/11/2013}}</ref>  In today<U+2019>s more observant standards, politicians wanted to pull away from the negative intonation of the name casting of Patronage, and Spoil system which lead them to rename the process <U+201C>Political Appointments<U+201D>.

== Current State of Political Appointees ==

The United States has the most political appointees in government than any other industrialized democracy in the world. Even though the United States has one of the largest populations of political appointees in the system, the efficiency of political appointees is constantly shifting. Political appointees are engraved in everyday decisions even making the final call on major events. President [[Barack Obama]] has been criticized for his controversial appointments throughout the years and has also been criticized for not filing appointments. As of 2013, [[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] has not had a senate-confirmed administrator since 2006 with [[Marilyn Tavenner]] as the acting administrator.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Theodoric|title=Under Obama, More Appointments Go Unfilled|url=http://www.propublica.org/article/under-obama-more-appointments-go-unfilled#filibuster-correx|publisher=ProPublica|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>  At least 60 positions for appointment remain vacant and 45 positions have remained vacant for more than a year. Judicial vacancies have also become a problem as well with numerous open seats for circuit and district judges left to be filled<ref>{{cite web|last=Bendery|first=Jennifer|title=Judicial Vacancies Skyrocket During President Obama's First Term|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/02/judicial-vacancies-obama_n_2228978.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref> . At the end of President Obama's first term, thirteen percent of presidential-appointed positions had not been filled<ref>{{cite book|last=Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|title=Plum Book|year=2012|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf}}</ref> .  Political appointees also come under heat for their own actions including [[Ben Bernanke]]'s involvement with private banks and also [[Michael D. Brown|Michael Brown]]'s involvement in Hurricane Katrina.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vedantam|first=S.|title=Who are the Better Managers -- Political Appointees or Career Bureaucrats?|url=Vedantam, S.

In a study done by [[Nick Gallo]] and [[David Lewis]] published by the [[Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory]], Gallo and Lewis created a program assessment rating tool known as [[PART]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gallo|first=Nick|coauthors=David Lewis|journal=Public Administration Research Theory|date=16|year=2011|month=May|url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/16/jopart.mur010.full|accessdate=11/11/2013|doi=10.1093/jopart/mur010|title=The Consequences of Presidential Patronage for Federal Agency Performance|volume=22|issue=2|pages=219}}</ref>  PART scored agencies effectiveness on a scale of 1 to 100. After evaluating over 1,000 agencies and more than 350 managers, Gallo and Lewis found that programs run by political appointees suffered. Managers with previous agency experience or political appointees who had not worked for a political campaign tended to rank higher than political appointees who even had business or non-profit experience. Gallo and Lewis believe careerist and appointees should work in a balanced atmosphere to work productively together and share crucial skills.

== Comparisons Between the Political Appointee System, the Spoils System and the Merit System ==

=== Political Appointees ===

* Political Appointees: Political appointees are subject to more ethics restrictions than regular executive branch employees. For purposes of this discussion, the term <U+201C>political appointee<U+201D> refers broadly to any employee who is appointed by the President, the Vice President, or agency head. As used here, the term encompasses two categories of appointees. Each category is subject to additional and slightly different ethics restrictions.<ref name="oge" />

=== Spoils System ===

{{main|Spoils system}}
* Spoils system/ patronage system: is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity<ref>{{cite web|title=Spoils System|url=[[Spoils_system|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=11/11/2013}}]]</ref>
=== Merit System ===

{{main|Merit system}}
* Merit system: is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system. A common conception of the Federal Government's merit system principles is that they are designed to ensure fair and open recruitment and competition and employment practices free of political influence or other nonmerit factors. Although that is certainly true, a closer reading of those principles suggests a much broader policy objective that relates directly to managing the ongoing performance of the Federal workforce.<ref>{{cite web|title=Merit System|url=[[Merit_system|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=11/11/2013}}]]</ref>
