'''Rhombic Chess''' is a [[chess variant]] for two players created by Tony Paletta in 1980.<ref>{{cite book

Each player commands a full set of [[chess pieces]] as in normal [[chess]].

The game was first published in ''Chess Spectrum Newsletter'' 2 by the inventor.
 
==Game rules==
The diagram shows the starting setup. As in normal chess, [[White and Black in chess|White]] moves first and [[checkmate]] wins the game. Piece moves are described using two basic types of movement: 
* ''edgewise'' means through the common side of adjoining rhombuses. If an edgewise move is more than one step, it continues in a straight line from the side of a rhombus through its opposite side, the line being orthogonal to these sides; 
* ''pointwise'' means through the sharpest corner of a rhombus, in a straight line to the next rhombus. (The paths are highlighted on the gameboard by same-colored cells.) 

===Piece movement===
* A rook moves edgewise only.
* A bishop moves pointwise. Or, it can move one step edgewise.<ref group="note">"A necessary perk otherwise the two bishops would be restricted to four spaces." {{harvcol|Pritchard|1994|p=255}}</ref>
* The queen moves as rook or bishop.
* The king moves one step edgewise or pointwise. There is no [[castling]] in Rhombic Chess.
* A knight moves in the pattern: one step edgewise followed by one step pointwise (or vice versa), away from its starting position. Like a normal chess knight, it leaps any intervening piece.<ref name=CECV>{{cite book

* A pawn moves forward one step edgewise, with the option of two steps on its first move. A pawn captures the ''same'' as it moves. There are no [[en passant]] captures in Rhombic Chess. A pawn [[Promotion (chess)|promotes]] to any piece other than king when reaching rank ''i'' (for White) and rank ''c'' (for Black).<ref group="note">"Pawns [...] promote on the array spaces of opponent's pawns; thus they travel the same distance as in orthochess." {{harvcol|Pritchard|1994|p=255}}</ref>

==Parachess==
[[File:Parachess gameboard and starting position.png|left|thumb|380px|'''Parachess''' starting setup; each army includes two ''sorcerers''. Cell colors highlight arcwise and wavepath movements.]]

Circa 2000, Paletta created '''Parachess'''<ref group="note">From "parallelogram" + "chess". (Paletta)</ref> using the same board geometry but introducing additional ways to move: 
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">an ''arcwise'' step means through the sharpest corner of a rhombus, to a rhombus not connected to the starting rhombus edgewise or pointwise;</li>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">a ''wavepath'' move means a series of arcwise steps, with each step in the opposite direction of the preceding step.</li> 
</ul>
These ways to move are highlighted on the gameboard by same-colored cells.
===Piece movement=== 
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">A rook moves edgewise only (as in Rhombic Chess).</li>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">A bishop moves pointwise (as in Rhombic) or along a wavepath.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">The queen moves as rook or bishop.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">The king moves one step edgewise, pointwise, or arcwise. As in Rhombic, there is no castling.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">The sorcerer moves in the pattern: one step pointwise, followed by one step edgewise or arcwise, or vice versa. It leaps any intervening piece.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 32em;">A pawn moves forward one step edgewise, pointwise, or arcwise; there is no initial two-step option. It captures forward one step edgewise or pointwise. There is no ''en passant''. A pawn must reach the opponent's furthest rank in order to promote.</li>
</ul>
