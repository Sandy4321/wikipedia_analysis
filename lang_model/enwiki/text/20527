In 1871, [[John W. Mackay]], [[James G. Fair]], [[James C. Flood]] and [[William S. O'Brien]], organized the Consolidated Virginia Silver Mine near [[Virginia City, Nevada]], from a number of smaller claims on the [[Comstock Lode]]. Later they added the near-by [[California mine]]. For three years after large ore bodies were uncovered in 1874 the two mines produced $3,000,000 per month. In 1876, for exhibition purposes, $6,000,000 was taken in one month from both mines. Production began to fall off in 1879 but in twenty-two years of operation the two mines yielded $150,000,000 in [[silver]] and [[gold]], and paid $78,148,800 in dividends. [[Bonanza]] is a Spanish term, meaning a rich ore body; the large vertical ore body they discovered in the hanging wall of the Comstock lode became known as the ''big bonanza''.
