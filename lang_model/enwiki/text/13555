Edward, the "Fullmetal Alchemist", is the youngest State Alchemist in the history of the fictional country of Amestris. His left leg was mystically severed in a failed attempt to resurrect his dead mother, his right arm taken in the exchange for his brother's soul. His missing limbs have been replaced with sophisticated prosthetics called automail; he and his younger brother, [[Alphonse Elric]], scour the world in search of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] in the hopes of restoring their bodies. Ed has appeared in other media from the series including [[video games]], [[original video animation]]s (OVAs) and [[light novels]].

Numerous publications in various media have been written on the subject of Edward's character. Reviewers praised Edward as a balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona. Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as the best moments in the series. His Japanese and English voice actors, [[Romi Park]] and [[Vic Mignogna]], have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures.

==Creation and conception==
Author [[Hiromu Arakawa]] integrated several social problems into the plot, such as the way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers after the death of their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help people all over the country to gain an understanding of the meaning of family.<ref name="new">{{cite journal|title=Equivalent Change|journal=[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]] USA|month=January|year=2006|publisher=[[A.D. Vision]] }}</ref> Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist Profiles|pages=100<U+2013>105|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-0768-4 }}</ref> Although she claims she has not thought of the characters' birthdates, Arakawa noted that she decided Edward's birthdate during the series' serialization. During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16, winter was about to begin in Hokkaido, Arakawa's birthplace, so it was decided Edward's birthdate would be in winter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 12|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|page=184|isbn=978-1-4215-0839-9}}</ref> The director of the first anime series, [[Seiji Mizushima]], says that in the development of the story Edward "evolves and devolves"; Mizushima comments that Edward is continuously overcoming inner struggles in order to determine how to grow up. The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character, making viewers note that Edward lost something important.<ref>{{cite journal|title=|journal=[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]] USA|month=March|year=2006|publisher=[[A.D.

In the Japanese version of ''Fullmetal Alchemist''{{'}}s anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by [[Romi Park]]. In the English version, the role has been played by [[Vic Mignogna]].<ref name="japvoice"/> Mignogna has stated that performing Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar and that he did not plan to sound like her.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Vic Mignogna|url=http://www.mania.com/being-brief-discussion-vic-mignogna_article_84273.html|author=Jeng, Way|date=April 19, 2005|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref>

==Appearances==
Edward Elric is the youngest State Alchemist to be selected by the State Military of the country, having achieved the rank of [[Major]] at age twelve, thus receiving the title of "Fullmetal Alchemist" shortly thereafter from military head, [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]]. He and his younger brother, [[Alphonse Elric|Alphonse]], seek to obtain the legendary Philosopher's Stone in order to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy. Edward was born in a small town named Resembool, where he lived with Alphonse, and of his parents, [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Trisha Elric|Trisha Elric]] and [[Van Hohenheim]]. After Hohenheim left the family on a journey early in his son's life, and Trisha died of an illness several years later, the two young boys were watched over by their neighbor, and father's friend, Pinako Rockbell. During that time, the brothers concentrated on studying [[alchemy]] in the hopes of bringing their mother back to life, and trained with a skilled alchemist named [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Izumi Curtis|Izumi Curtis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 5|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 21|isbn=978-1-4215-0175-8}}</ref> Upon their return from their training, they proceeded to perform the greatest taboo of alchemy, the art of human transmutation. The attempt failed, costing Edward his left leg, and Alphonse his entire body. Edward then performed a second transmutation, sacrificing his own right arm to bind Alphonse's soul to a nearby suit of armor.<ref name="c23"/> 

His father's early disappearance, the death of his mother, and a failed attempt at human transmutation all play pivotal roles in Edward's story. Edward's motivation stems from a love for his brother, Alphonse, whom he is desperately seeking to restore to human form after their mistake. He often feels that their situation is his fault, and thus is his responsibility to solve.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 4|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 15|page=98|isbn=978-1-59116-929-1}}</ref> Edward also behaves in a childish manner when confronted about his short height, tending to overreact to any negative comment regarding the subject, usually attacking people in a fit of rage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Omake|isbn=978-1-59116-920-8}}</ref> Despite all of the obstacles that Edward tackles in the story, he still displays a childish personality regarding things he despises, such as needles and milk.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 4|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 14|page=65|isbn=978-1-59116-929-1}}</ref> He is extremely idealistic, and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of "Equivalent Exchange," states which that every outcome requires an equal payment. Edward also uses "Equivalent Exchange" as his own personal [[philosophy]]. Despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, he has been shown to be a selfless, strong, independent, and mature young adult who gains a reputation as a "hero of the people."<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 4|isbn=978-1-59116-920-8}}</ref>

Edward's automail limbs were designed by his childhood friend, [[Winry Rockbell]], and her grandmother, Pinako. Edward often fights by transmuting a section of his right forearm into an automail blade.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 2|page=82|isbn=978-1-59116-920-8}}</ref> Winry is often kept busy repairing Edward's automail, as he regularly breaks and damages the machines during heavy bouts. In both the anime and manga, Winry is shown to be an extremely important person to Edward. In the first anime series, romantic feelings are hinted at, but are never explicitly stated. In the manga and second anime series, Winry admits to being in love with him, while Edward exhibits similar feelings toward her, although he constantly denies it until the series' end in which he confesses to her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 15|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 58|isbn=978-1-4215-1380-5}}</ref>

Unlike regular alchemists who use transmutation circles, Edward has the ability to create alchemical currents in his body simply by connecting his hands. This is a direct result of seeing the Gate of Truth, the source of all alchemical knowledge, while attempting to resurrect his mother in the failed human transmutation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 2|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 6|page=94|isbn=978-1-59116-923-9}}</ref> In the manga, this knowledge is great enough to save his own life, as he heals a would-be fatal wound.<ref name="chapter 77">{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 19|year=2009|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 77|isbn=978-1-4215-2568-6}}</ref> In addition to his alchemical abilities, Edward is a formidable fighter as a result of his training with Izumi, who had extensively trained both brothers in [[martial arts]] when they became her apprentices after the death of their mother.<ref name="c23">{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 6|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 23|isbn=978-1-4215-0319-6|pages=61<U+2013>63}}</ref>

While battling Father, Edward loses his automail arm, rendering him unable to perform alchemy. Alphonse, on the brink of death due to damage to his blood seal, transmutes his soul in order to restore Edward's original flesh-and-blood arm. After defeating Father, Edward manages to restore Alphonse to his original body by sacrificing his own ability to use alchemy. Soon after, Edward decides to research alchemy by heading out west.

As a result, Edward finds himself on the other side of the Gate, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]], while Alphonse recovers his original body.
