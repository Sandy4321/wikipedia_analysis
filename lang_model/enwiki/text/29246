'''Mark Gordon Robins''' (born [[December 22]], [[1969]] in [[Ashton Under Lyne]]) is an [[England|English]] [[association football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|manager]] currently at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]].

As a player, he was most notable for his exploits with Manchester United and Rotherham United.

==Playing career==
Robins started his career in the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] youth system.  In [[1990]], he scored one of the most important goals in United history when he scored the winning goal in an [[FA Cup]] game against [[Nottingham Forest]], when manager [[Alex Ferguson]]'s job was reportedly on the line.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4032171.stm BBC SPORT | Football | My Club | Man Utd | Ferguson's defining moments<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> United went on to win the Cup that year (Robins scored the winner in the semi-final replay against [[Oldham Athletic]] at [[Maine Road]]) and Ferguson went to on to attain much success.  Mark would score 17 goals in his Manchester United career.

Robins left [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] for a fee of <U+00A3>800,000 where he played an important role in some of the club's greatest successes. In his first game his two goals helped Norwich defeat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] on the opening day of the first ever Premier League season. He helped them qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]] at the end of the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93 season]], in which Norwich finished third. His [[1993-94 in English football|1993-94 season]] was interrupted by a serious injury, and coincided with a slump in form for Norwich, who finished 12th after spending most of the first half of the season in the top five.

In [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95]], after falling out with Norwich manager [[John Deehan]], he was sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but was unable to prevent them from being relegated to Division One (ironically along with Norwich). He did, however, help them win promotion back to the Premier League via the playoffs in [[1995-96 in English football|1995-96]], and win the [[Football League Cup|Coca-Cola Cup]] in [[1996-97 in English football|1996-97]], when they finished ninth in the [[Premier League]].

Robins later played for [[F.C. Copenhagen]], [[Reading F.C.]], [[CD Ourense]], [[Panionios]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_city/2780229.stm BBC SPORT | Football | Teams | Bristol City | Robins keen to make a mark<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]].
