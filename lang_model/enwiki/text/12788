'''Thomas Ward Custer''' ([[March 15]],[[1845]] &ndash; [[June 25]], [[1876]]) was a [[U.S. Army]] officer and two-time winner of the [[Medal of Honor]] for bravery during the [[American Civil War]]. He was a younger brother of [[George Armstrong Custer]], perishing with him at [[Battle of Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]] in the [[Montana Territory]].

==Early life and Civil War==

He was born in [[New Rumley, Ohio]], the third son of Emanuel and Maria Custer. He enlisted in the [[Union Army]], in September 1861, at age 16, and served in the early campaigns of the Civil War as a [[private (rank)|private]] in the 21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He saw action at numerous battles, including [[Battle of Stones River|Stones River]], [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Missionary Ridge]] and the [[Atlanta Campaign]]. He mustered out in October 1864 as a [[corporal]]. Commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in Company B of the 6th Michigan Cavalry, he became his brother's [[aide-de-camp]] and accompanied him throughout the last year of the war.

Tom Custer distinguished himself by winning successively the [[brevet (military)|brevets]] of [[captain]], [[major]], and [[lieutenant colonel]], although he was barely twenty years of age when the Civil War ended. He was awarded two Medals of Honor for capturing [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] regimental flags (at [[Battle of Namozine Church|Namozine Church]] on [[April 3]], [[1865]], and again at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]] on [[April 6]], [[1865]]). He was one of only four soldiers or sailors to receive the dual honor during the Civil War, and one of just nineteen in history. His second citation includes, 

{{Quotation|"Custer crossed the line of temporary works on the flank of the road, where his unit was confronted by a supporting battle-line. In the second line he wrested the colors from an enemy color bearer. Advancing on another standard he received a shot in the face which knocked him back on his horse. Despite his wounds, he continued his assault on the color bearer who began to fall from wounds he had also received. As he fell, the wounded Lieutenant Custer reached out to grasp this second standard of colors, bearing both off in triumph."|United States Army|Medal of Honor citation}}

==Indian Wars==

Following the war, Custer was appointed [[first lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] in 1866. He was wounded in the [[Battle of Washita River|Washita]] campaign of the [[Indian Wars]], in 1868. He later served on [[Reconstruction]] duty in [[South Carolina]] and participated in the [[Yellowstone Expedition]] of 1873 and the [[Black Hills Expedition]] of 1874. He was appointed captain in 1875 and given command of Company C of the 7th Cavalry. Custer participated in the arrest of the Lakota [[Rain-in-the-Face]] for murder at the trading post at [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock Agency]]. 

During the 1876 Little Bighorn campaign of the [[Black Hills War]], he served as aide-de-camp to Lt. Col. George A. Custer and died with his brother. Lt. [[Henry Moore Harrington|Henry Harrington]] actually led Company C during the battle. Younger brother [[Boston Custer]] also died in the fighting, as did other Custer relatives and friends. It was widely rumored that Rain-in-the-Face, who had escaped from captivity and was a participant at the Little Bighorn, had cut out Tom Custer's heart as revenge. This tale seems apocryphal. However, Custer's body was badly mutilated post-mortem. His remains were identified by a recognizable tattoo of his initials on his arm.

Tom Custer was buried on the battlefield, but exhumed the next year and reburied in [[Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery]]. A stone memorial slab marks the place where his body was discovered and initially buried.
