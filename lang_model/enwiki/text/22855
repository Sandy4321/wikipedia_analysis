The relationship between '''Intelligent design and science''' has been a contentious one.  [[Intelligent design]] is presented by its proponents as science and claims to offer an alternative to [[evolution]].  The [[Discovery Institute]], a politically conservative think tank and the leading proponents of intelligent design, launched a campaign entitled "Teach the Controversy" which claims that a controversy exists within the scientific community over evolution.  The scientific community, however, states that there is no controversy and rejects intelligent design as [[creationism]] due to ID proponents' lack of peer-reviewed research and the scientifically undefined quality of observable [[intelligence]].

=="Teach the Controversy"==
{{Main|Teach the Controversy}}

The intelligent design movement states that there is a debate among scientists about whether life evolved. The movement stresses the importance of recognizing the existence of this supposed debate, seeking to convince the public, politicians, and cultural leaders that schools should "[[Teach the Controversy]]".<ref>

Many intelligent design followers believe that "[[Scientism]]" is itself a religion that promotes [[secularism]] and [[materialism]] in an attempt to erase [[theism]] from public life, and they view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres.

The cardinal, it seems, had received the backing of the new pope, Benedict XVI, the former Joseph Ratzinger (b. 1927), who in the mid-1980s, while serving as prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, successor to the notorious Inquisition, had written a defense of the doctrine of creation agasint Catholics who stressed the sufficiency of "selection and mutation."

Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] directly criticized the advocates of intelligent design as presenting a perspective of God that is dangerous to religion.<ref name="Slifkin">Natan Slifkin (2006). ''The Challenge of Creation'' (New York: Yashar Books) 288 ff.</ref> Those who promote it as parallel to religion, he asserts, do not truly understand it. Slifkin criticizes intelligent design's advocacy of teaching their perspective in biology classes, wondering why no one claims that God's hand should be taught in other secular classes, such as history, physics or geology. Slifkin also asserts that the intelligent design movement is inordinately concerned with portraying God as "in control" when it comes to things that cannot be easily explained by science, but not in control in respect to things which ''can'' be explained by scientific theory.<ref name="Slifkin" /> Kenneth Miller expressed a view similar to Slifkin's: "[T]he struggles of the Intelligent Design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double failures<U+2014>rejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having failed religion because they think too little of God.<ref>

*The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified.
*The methods should preferably be published in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.
*There should be a known rate of [[error]] that can be used in evaluating the results.
*The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.
In ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', using these criteria and others mentioned above, Judge Jones [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|ruled that]] "... we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents".

At the Kitzmiller trial, philosopher [[Robert T. Pennock]] described a common approach to distinguishing science from non-science as examining a theory's compliance with [[methodological naturalism]], the basic method in science of seeking natural explanations without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural.<ref>Pennock, Robert T.

He noted that scientists such as [[Joan Roughgarden]] and [[Lynn Margulis]] have challenged certain Darwinist theories and offered explanations of their own and despite this they "have not been persecuted, shunned, fired or even expelled. Why? Because they are doing science, not religion."<ref>http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-04-17.html#part1</ref> The issue that supernatural explanations do not conform to the [[scientific method]] became a sticking point for intelligent design proponents in the 1990s, and is addressed in the [[wedge strategy]] as an aspect of science that must be challenged before intelligent design can be accepted by the broader scientific community.

Critics and advocates debate over whether intelligent design produces new research and has legitimately attempted to publish this research. For instance, the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]], a former funder of the Discovery Institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion, says that it asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, but none were ever submitted.

==Intelligence as an observable quality==
The phrase ''intelligent design'' makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], a concept that has no [[scientific consensus]] definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that "Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature". The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be [[observation|observable]] without specifying what the criteria for the [[measurement]] of intelligence should be. Dembski, instead, asserts that "in special sciences ranging from [[forensics]] to [[archaeology]] to [[SETI]] (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable".<ref>

[[Seth Shostak]], a researcher with the [[SETI Institute]], disputed Dembski's comparison of SETI and intelligent design, saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference of design on complexity<U+2014>the argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes<U+2014>while SETI researchers are looking primarily for [[Artificial creation|artificial]]ity.<ref>

Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<ref group="n">"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies".<U+2014>{{cite court

As a means of criticism, certain [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]] have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of [[artificial intelligence]]. The criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent, specifically that "no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent, that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes".<ref>

|archivedate=2001-10-18}}</ref> This claim is similar in type to an assumption of [[Cartesian dualism]] that posits a strict separation between "mind" and the material [[Universe]]. However, in studies of artificial intelligence, while there is an implicit assumption that supposed "intelligence" or [[creativity]] of a [[computer program]] is determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer [[programmer]], artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules. Rather, if a computer program can access [[randomness]] as a function, this effectively allows for a flexible, creative, and adaptive intelligence. [[Evolutionary algorithms]], a subfield of machine learning (itself a subfield of artificial intelligence), have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to "evolve" complex, highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer. Evolutionary algorithms use the Darwinian metaphor of random mutation, selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods. Intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the "innate" intelligence associated with biological organisms, and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception that intelligence itself necessarily requires a designer. [[Cognitive science]] continues to investigate the nature of intelligence along these lines of inquiry. The intelligent design community, for the most part, relies on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems.<ref>
