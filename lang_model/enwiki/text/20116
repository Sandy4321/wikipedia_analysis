'''Elizabeth Diane "Beth" Mynatt''' (born [[July 12]], [[1966]]) is Director of the [[GVU Center]] at [[Georgia Tech]]; [[Associate Dean]] of Strategic Planning, College of Computing; and [[Associate Professor]], School of Interactive Computing, College of Computing at Georgia Tech. She is best known for her research in the fields of [[human-computer interaction]], [[ubiquitous computing]], [[health informatics]], and [[assistive technology]]. She pioneered creating nonspeech auditory interfaces from graphical interfaces to enable blind computer users to work with modern computer applications. From 2001-2005, she was selected to be the Associated Director of the [[GVU Center]] and in 2005 she became Director. Her current research explores the implications and opportunities stemming from the pervasive presence of computation in the informal activities of everyday life.

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Elizabeth D. Mynatt was born in [[Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]]. She attended [[North Carolina State University]] for her undergraduate studies, graduating summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in [[computer science]] in 1988. She received a [[master's degree]] in 1989 in Information and Computer Science at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Mynatt went on to receive a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1995 in [[Computer Science]] where she was advised by [[James Foley]]. Her thesis, <U+201C>Audio GUIs: Transforming Graphical User Interfaces into Auditory Interfaces<U+201D>, was a system which transformed applications into auditory interfaces to enable people to experience what interacting with graphical interfaces might be like for a blind user <ref>Mynatt, Beth (1995). "Audio GUIs: Transforming Graphical User Interfaces into Auditory Interfaces." PhD dissertation, Georgia Institute of Technology.</ref>. Upon graduation from Georgia Tech, Mynatt accepted a position as a member of the Research Staff at Xerox PARC. In 1995 she returned to Georgia Tech as an [[Assistant Professor]] and in 2002 became Associate Professor. From 2004-2005 she was Director of the [[Aware Home Research Initiative]] and from 2006-2007 was the Associate Director of the Health Systems Institute. Mynatt is married to [[Blair MacIntyre]]. They have two children, Grace and William (nicknamed Buzz after the Georgia Tech mascot). 

===Georgia Tech===
Mynatt currently directs the [[GVU Center]] at Georgia Tech. She also directs the research program in [[Everyday Computing]] , examining the human-computer interface implications of having computation continuously present in many aspects of everyday life. Themes in her research include supporting informal collaboration and awareness in office environments, enabling creative work and visual communication, and augmenting social processes for managing personal information. Dr. Mynatt is one of the principal researchers in the Aware Home Research Initiative; investigating the design of future home technologies, especially those that enable older adults to continue living independently as opposed to moving to an institutional care setting<ref>Bill Husted. New Technology Can Help Elderly Enjoy Their Senior Years. May 10, 2002.</ref><ref>Max Alexander. Home, Smart Home. Reader<U+2019>s Digest. </ref>.

In home environments, she is interested in using computing technology to increase the independence and capabilities of people and families for domains such as chronic health care, aging in place, and cognitive prosthetics<ref>Ernest Holsendolph. Georgia Researchers Explore Possibilities of a Digital Home. May 10, 2000.</ref>. In office environments, she is interested in supporting fluid collaboration practices by leveraging the integrated design of physical and digital spaces and services with social practices surrounding information sharing.

Mynatt has taught courses in Human-Computer Interaction, Everyday Computing, Mobile and Ubuquitous Computing, and Media Computation. For seven years (2000-2007) she played a leadership role in the design and management of two new programs: the Ph.D. in [[Human-Centered Computing]] and the M.S. program in Human-Computer Interaction. For the HCC Ph.D. program, she co-chaired the first formative committee that charted the possibilities for a new human-centric Ph.D. program, and directed the HCC program from its inception until the Fall of 2006. She has published over 100 book chapters, conference publications, and journal articles in top tier locations such as ACM SIGCHI, CSCW, Ubicomp, and Pervasive. 

Mynatt is an internationally recognized expert in the areas of ubiquitous computing and assistive technologies. She is a Sloan Research Fellow and her research is supported by multiple grants from the [[National Science Foundation]] including a five-year NSF CAREER award and a two-year [[IBM]] Faculty Partnership Award. She was recently awarded a Google Research Award for studying individual approaches to management of diabetes and she has also received awards from IBM, [[NASA]], the NSF, and Siemens.Other honorary awards include the 2001 College of Computing's Junior Faculty Research award and the 2003 College of Computing's Dean's Award. Her work in healthcare has led to invited lectures at [[Google]], [[Cornell University]], and [[IBM Research]] among others.

Mynatt is currently program chair for CHI 2010, the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and has also served as conference chair for ICAD, UIST , and Ubicomp. She has published dozens of scholarly articles in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journal|journals]] and has given invited presentations at [[academic conference]]s such as [[CHI (conference)|CHI]] and [[Ubicomp (conference)|Ubicomp]]. She has over 80 publications in the ACM with over 6,000 downloads in the past year. Her visionary article <U+201C>Charting past, present, and future research in ubiquitous computing<U+201D> has been cited over 800 times.{{fact}} She has been quoted in a number of major newspapers, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' <ref>Annys Shin. Surf City, Here she Comes. Washingtonpost.com. Jan 30, 2005.</ref> <ref>Kelly Greene. Inside the Home of the Future. The Wall Street Journal. Feb 23, 2004.</ref> <ref>Don Fernandez. The wireless life. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Oct 9, 2005</ref>. Mynatt is a member of numerous academic journals and professional societies, including [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and [[Association_for_Computing_Machinery|ACM]]. She has held membership on a number of Georgia Tech committees, including the Dean Search Committee, the Dean<U+2019>s Executive Council, the Graduate Committee, and Faculty Program Coordinator for the HCC PhD and MS HCI programs. She holds four patents for her work in user interfaces and audio systems.
