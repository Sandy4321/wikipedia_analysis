==Development==
===Bisexuality===
Ravi's first storyline was his bisexuality. The character was first revealed as bisexual during an episode in which he tried to kiss [[Russ Owen]].<ref name="morehollyoaks"/> Speaking of the character's masculinity and non-stereotypical bisexual, Stephan Uppal stated, "I think they've dealt with it really well. When it's something as big as this, you sit down with the writers and the directors and you discuss everything. I thought that it was about time that a soap portrayed a bisexual or gay character who isn't overtly feminine or camp. You get them in every other soap - you see Coronation Street, EastEnders and even Hollyoaks with John Paul - he was quite camp in the way he was playing the part because that's how the character was meant to be played. But with Ravi, he's just this very masculine lad."<ref name="morehollyoaks">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a160035/more-from-hollyoaks-boxer-ravi-roy.html |title=More from 'Hollyoaks' boxer Ravi Roy |publisher=Digital Spy |date=[[2009-06-16]] |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref>

Ravi embarked on a three-way relationship with [[Kris Fisher]] and [[Nancy Hayton]], however this was short lived. Ravi came out to his parents about his sexuality, however they were not bothered and actually assumed he was gay. Siblings Leila and Ash appeared to already know of Ravi's sexuality, with Ash saying in an episode "You still greedy then?", referring to having sexual feelings towards both males and females.

===Aneurysm===
Ravi's diagnosis with a [[cerebral aneurysm]] was the characters second storyline.<ref name="stephenuppal"/> After several dizzy spells, Kris urged Ravi to see a doctor, when he did so, he was told he had an aneurysm, which could kill him any time. Ravi struggled with the prospect of having to live without things including alcohol and sexual intercourse, which both could trigger the aneurysm to kill him. Kris and Ravi became closer once again. Uppal spoke out about the relationship stating, "They're both mature men but it really brings them closer together than when they were a couple. When they were together, though, Kris just thought "he's a gorgeous bloke, I'm having a bit of fun here". There was never anything deep and meaningful from his point of view - it was Ravi who ended up falling for Kris, surprisingly enough. But now their relationship's taken to another level because you realise that Kris does genuinely have strong feelings for Ravi as a friend and he does care about his well-being and his welfare."<ref name="stephenuppal">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a160023/stephen-uppal-ravi-roy-hollyoaks.html |title=Stephen Uppal (Ravi Roy, Hollyoaks) |publisher=Digital Spy |date=[[2009-06-16]] |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref>

Ravi, despite being fully aware of what could happen, began illegal street fights, coached by Ash, who was unaware of the aneurysm until Ravi became slightly blinded by a fight. When the rest of his family found out, they became over-protective, this sending Ravi over the edge, threatening Leila violently. Ravi began another illegal fight, however his family found out and stopped him. Angry, Ravi taunted Ash, who then punched him. Ravi went into a coma and had to under-go an emergency [[craniotomy]], to remove the tumour, with a 60% chance of his dying or being severally brain-damaged. Ravi's operation was a success and he began to recover in hospital.

==Storylines==

Ravi is first seen when he begins to play with [[Charlie Dean]]. [[Nancy Hayton]] sees him and assumes he is trying to kidnap Charlie. Nancy then realises the misunderstanding. Ravi starts work at The Loft as a bouncer and briefly moves in with [[Warren Fox]] and [[Louise Summers]]. Ravi is given the job of interviewing several people for a position at The Loft and interviews Nancy. Ravi takes her application as a joke and sleeps with [[Mercedes McQueen]] after her interview. Ravi and Nancy grow closer when a smoke bomb goes off in The Loft and he saves her. Nancy gives Ravi a kiss but is offended by Warren, who says the bomb was him due to his ethnicity. Nancy and Ravi then begin a relationship.

On a drunken night, Ravi attempts to kiss [[Russ Owen]], revealing himself as [[bisexual]]. Russ pushes back Ravi, who tries to say he was just joking. Ravi breaks up with Nancy, however the pair do get back together. [[Kris Fisher]] catches Ravi looking at him and becomes suspicious. Kris and Ravi then start a secret affair, however, unbeknown to Ravi, Nancy and Kris have also began an affair. Nancy catches Ravi and Kris kissing, however does not do anything. They then realise the relationship could work as a three-way. Nancy struggles to cope with two relationships due to jealousy over Ravi and Kris and finishes with both of them. Kris and Ravi continue their relationship, with Kris urging Ravi to come out to his parents at [[Bel Roy|Bel's]] Ram Navami, which he does. Kris then decides to dump Ravi, leaving him heartbroken

In June 2009, Ravi helps [[Ash Roy|Ash]] rebuild his restaurant Relish. He befriends [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2009)#Caleb Ramsey|Caleb Ramsey]], who is also helping with brother [[Zak Ramsey|Zak]]. Ash tells Caleb that Ravi might have a thing for him. Caleb, realising what he means, runs after Ravi outside and punches him due to his sexuality. Ash notices Ravi's burst lip, but Bel assumes that it was a racially motivated attack. Ash tells Ravi to tell Bel and [[Govinda Roy|Gov]] that Caleb hit him because of his sexuality and then states that Ravi is ashamed of himself. Later, Ravi goes dizzy and collapses in the bathroom. He admits to Kris what happened after he almost faints again. Kris convinces Ravi to go to the hospital for a check-up. Ravi agrees and Kris accompanies him. Ravi runs out of the hospital after receiving devastating news, which he then reveals to Kris and tells him that he was diagnosed with a [[cerebral aneurysm]], which could kill him at any moment. Caleb later tries to start another fight with Ravi and Kris. Ravi punches a drunken Caleb when he tries to kiss [[Leila Roy|Leila]].

Ravi becomes involved in illegal fighting, managed by Ash. Ravi is punched during one fight and slightly loses his sight. Leila blames Ash for his condition. Ravi eventually regains his sight. In August, Ravi and [[Loretta Jones]] begin flirting and go to The Dog on a date. Ravi feels smothered by Leila and Nancy, who sit near them in the bar. Ravi then violently attacks Leila, telling her to stay away. Despite his family's pleas, Ravi arranges another illegal fight without anyone knowing until Kris finds out and alerted the Roys. Bel, [[Anita Roy|Anita]], Loretta, Kris and Ash all arrive and stop him before he is seriously injured. Ravi, angry by their inference, taunts Ash, which leads to Ash punching him. Ravi then collapsed and falls into a coma. During his time in hospital, Ravi wakes up and overhears Ash telling Anita she was [[adopted]]. When Ravi wakes up fully, he tells his family what he heard, despite Ash claiming Anita had found her birth certificate and came to him. Ash is then disowned.
