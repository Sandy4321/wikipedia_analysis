'''Cromer railway station''' (formerly '''Cromer Beach''') is a railway station in the town of [[Cromer]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Norfolk]]. The station is served by local services operated by [['one']] on the [[Bittern Line]] from [[Norwich]] to [[Cromer]] and [[Sheringham]]. Although Cromer has been served by trains since [[26 March]] [[1877]] by means of [[Cromer High railway station|Cromer High station]] (see below), the station currently in use opened on [[16 June]] [[1887]].

Cromer is one of only two former [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] (M&GN) stations to remain operational on [[Network Rail]].

==Other stations in Cromer==
Cromer was once served by three railway stations - Cromer Beach (M&GN), [[Cromer High railway station|Cromer High]] (operated by the [[Great Eastern Railway]]) and [[Cromer Links Halt railway station|Cromer Links]] on the now closed [[Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway]] line to [[North Walsham railway station|North Walsham]] via [[Overstrand]] and [[Mundesley]]. Cromer Links closed with the rest of the line betweeen Mundesley and [[Roughton Road railway station|Roughton Road]] on [[6 April]] [[1953]]. Cromer High was situated some distance from the town and was closed on [[20 September]] [[1954]], with all services diverted into the more convenient Cromer Beach station, which is now known simply as Cromer station.

After the growth of new housing developments in the area, a new station was opened at [[Roughton Road railway station|Roughton Road]] in the south of the town on [[20 May]] [[1985]], near the junction for the disused [[Cromer Tunnel]] leading to the former Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway line. The new station is approximately 200 metres from the site of Cromer High station.

==Buildings==
With heavy leisure traffic at the time of construction, Cromer Beach railway station had a large station building in a [[timber framing|half-timbered]] style, and a large goods yard. Following the introduction of [[Conductor (transportation)#Train Conductor (UK and Australasia)|conductor-guard working]], the ticket facilities were no longer needed and the building fell into disuse; it was renovated and reopened as a [[public house]] in [[1998]]. A large [[Safeway plc|Safeway]] supermarket was built on the site of the goods yards in [[1991]]<ref>{{cite book

==Service==
There is generally an hourly service to Sheringham (8mins) and an hourly return to Norwich (55mins).

On Sundays there is a two hourly service to Sheringham and return to Norwich.

Because of its historical position as the terminus of a branch line from [[Melton Constable]] to the west, trains running via Cromer reverse direction on leaving the station.
