==Introduction==
[[Image:British Museum Great Court roof.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of the Great Court, British Museum, London.]]
'''Buro Happold''' is a professional services firm providing [[engineering]] consultancy, [[design]], planning, project management and consulting services for all aspects of buildings, infrastructure and the environment. It was founded in [[1976]],  by Sir [[Edmund Happold]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in the southwest of [[England]] when he left Ove [[Arup]] and Partners to take up a post at [[Bath University]] as Professor of [[Architecture]] and Engineering Design.  Originally working mainly on projects in the [[Middle East]], the firm now operates worldwide and in almost all areas of engineering for the built environment, with offices in seven countries.

==Sir Edmund Happold==
Ted Happold worked at [[Arup]] before founding Buro Happold, where he worked on projects such as the [[Sydney Opera House]] and the [[Pompidou Centre]].  Ted Happold was a leader in the field of lightweight and [[tensile structure]]s and Buro Happold has as a result undertaken a large number of [[tensile structure|tensile]] and other lightweight structures since its founding, including the [[Millennium Dome]].  Ted Happold died in 1996, but his influence on the firm is enduring.  Ted Happold was a [[Quaker]], and his deep sense of humanity and principles can still be found in much of the work undertaken by the firm.

==History==
[[Image:Expo2000 venezuela1.jpg|200px|thumb|The Venezuela Pavilion at Expo2000.]]
Buro Happold was founded on the [[1 May]] [[1976]], with its first office on Gay Street in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[United Kingdom]]. The firm started with seven partners:

Initially, Buro Happold offered only [[structural engineering]] [[consultancy]], with a particular strength in [[tensile structure|lightweight structures]], but in 1977 it added [[geotechnical engineering]] and in 1978 [[building services engineering]]. Over the years the firm has added a large range of different services, including FEDRA, a leading [[fire engineering]] consultancy. The firm also developed a variety of specialist services to support [[design]] and [[construction]], including in-house [[software]] for modelling fire and fabric and cable structures.

The King's Office, Council of Ministers and Majlis Al Shura ([[KOCOMMAS]]), Central Government Complex in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] was the firm's first major design project in 1976. 

In 1983, Buro Happold opened an office in Riyadh, and has since opened offices around the UK and internationally:

From its foundation, Buro Happold worked on a number of different projects with [[Frei Otto]], a leading expert on lightweight structures and [[gridshell]]s, such as the Japan Pavillion for [[Expo 2000]] in [[Hanover]]. The firm has also historically had close ties with [[Bath University]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

By 1993, Buro Happold had 130 employees and 8 partners. In 1998 this had grown to 300 employees and 12 partners, while in 2000 with over 500 employees the partnership was increased to 23. In 2006 the partnership stood at 25 with over 1400 employees and 14 offices.

Due to this growth and the addition of so many different services, the company was restructured in 2003 to consist of multi-disciplinary teams of engineers, each with structural, mechanical and electrical engineers supported by specialist consulting groups.

In 2005, Buro Happold launched Happold Consulting, a management and overseas development consultancy with expertise in the construction sector.
