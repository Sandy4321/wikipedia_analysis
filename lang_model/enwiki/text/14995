{{Campaignbox Arauco War}}

During the '''Siege of Concepcion''' of the [[Arauco War]], 20,000 warriors of the army of the [[Mapuche]] laid [[siege]] to the Spanish garrison and civil population in the [[fortress]] of [[Concepcion, Chile]]. 

==History==
In early 1564, Spanish governor [[Pedro de Villagra]], was taking measures to protect all the towns and forts he already held against the growing Mapuche revolt and to organize a field army in Concepcion.  He knew that one of the Mapuche objectives was to surround Concepcion, and preparations were made to support a long [[siege]]. 

Raids by Mapuche bands had made it unsafe for Spaniards to go farther than a league from the city. After a brief fight 3,000 Mapuche in the Itata River valley under [[Loble]] defeated the troops of captain [[Francisco de Vaca]] coming with reinforcements from Santiago.  Meanwhile another 3,000 warriors under [[Millalelmo]] defeated the troops coming from Angol under captain, [[Juan Perez de Zurita]], at a crossing of the [[Andali<U+00E9>n River]] two leagues from Concepcion<ref> Marmolejo, Historia..., Cap<U+00ED>tulo XLV</ref>.  Both defeats had reduced the garrison of Concepcion to defensive measures and cut off Concepcion from aid by land.  The survivors of the two battles had to retreat to Santiago and were in no condition to break through the [[Investment (military)|investment]] around Concepcion. 

Meanwhile the caciques Millalelmu and Loble with 20,000 warriors from the area between the Itata and [[Bio-Bio river|Bio-Bio]] rivers, had looted and destroyed Spanish estancias in the vicinity of Concepcion, took their herds and then settled down to besiege Concepcion in early February 1564. The Mapuche entered the city, sacking and burning it, the population crowding within the walls of its fortress with its 200 man garrison under governor Pedro de Villagra.  The Mapuche then built a fortified camp on heights overlooking the city from which they descended to attack it. 

The siege lasted two months with continuous skirmishes. At the end of March two Spanish ships arrived bringing food that permitted the population to continue the siege for a much longer time.  On the other side the Mapuche had used up local sources of food and without pack animals and transport vehicles were finding it difficult to bring in enough to maintain their large force.  Also the harvest season was coming and failure to bring in the crops would result in a winter of hunger for their families.  With the recent news of the defeat of the Mapuche [[toqui]] [[Illanguli<U+00E9>n]] at the [[Battle of Angol]], they were also nervous that their undefended homes might be attacked from Angol or Santiago. On the first of April the Mapuche army raised the siege and dispersed to their homes for the winter.<ref> [[Diego Barros Arana]], '''Historia General De Chile''', Tomo Segundo, Parte Tercera La Colonia desde 1561 hasta 1610, Capitulo Segundo Sec. 4</ref>
