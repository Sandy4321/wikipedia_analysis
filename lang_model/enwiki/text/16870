'''''Anabaena circinalis''''' is a species of Gram-negative, photosynthetic cyanobacteria common to freshwater environments throughout the world. Much of the scientific interest in '' A. circinalis '' owes to its production of several potentially harmful cyanotoxins, ranging in potency from irritating to lethal.<ref>Baker P. Anabaena circinalis. In: Tyler P, editor; Tyler P, editor. Identification of common noxious cyanobacteria, part 1. Nostocales. Melbourne, Australia: Melbourne Water Corporation; 1992. pp. 39<U+2013>45.</ref> Under favorable conditions for growth, '' A. circinalis '' forms large algae-like  blooms, potentially harming the flora and fauna of an area.

== Morphology ==
''Anabaena circinalis'' exhibits a filamentous morphology , each filament a string of task-specific cells. The appearance of cell differentiation was a great evolutionary leap; marking cyanobacteria as one of the first multicellular organisms on Earth.<ref>Tomitani A, Knoll AH, Cavanaugh CM, Ohno T: The evolutionary diversification of cyanobacteria: Molecular-phylogenetic and paleontological perspectives.
Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America 2006, 103(14):5442-5447.</ref> On the  '' A. circinalis '' filament, the most numerous structures are '''vegetative cells''' , responsible for the [[Photosynthesis#Cyanobacteria_and_the_evolution_of_photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] of high-energy sugars from environmental carbon, water, and sunlight. The energy from photosynthesis is used, in part, for the biosynthesis of cellular materials from nitrogenous compounds. 
During periods when combined nitrogen (e.g. ammonia or nitrate) is unavailable, '' A. circinalis '' form heterocysts, larger, round, [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] cells found every ten to twenty cells or so on the filament. Heterocysts function to convert environmental nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) into compounds such as ammonia or nitrate. '''[[Nitrogenase]]''', an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, is essential to this conversion. For the proper functioning of nitrogenase, the intracellular environment of the heterocyst must be [[anaerobic]]{{dn|date=September 2012}}, a task achieved by the oxygen-impermeable structure of the heterocyst wall.<ref>Aldea MR, Kumar K, Golden JW. 2008. Heterocyst development and pattern formation. In chemical communication among bacteria (ed. Winans S.C. and Bassler B.L.), pp. 75<U+2013>90. ASM Press, Washington, DC.</ref> Although functioning independent of each other, vegetative cells and heterocysts are both essential to the survival of the organism; vegetative cells providing energy-rich sugars to the organism, while heterocysts fix nitrogen for amino acid production and cellular biosynthesis. 
Also found along the filaments are '''gas vacuoles''', specialized compartments that inflate or deflate with air to provide upward or downward movement.<ref>Walsby, A. E. (1994). Gas vesicles. Microbiology Review, 58(1), 94-144.</ref> This adaptation positions '' A. circinalis '' at a favorable depth, determined by available sunlight, water temperature, or O<sub>2</sub> concentration. 
With optimal environmental conditions, '' Anabaena circinalis '' grow unchecked, forming large blooms that appear as a greenish slime at the surface of the water (fig. 2). In harsh conditions, '' A. circinalis '' form spore-like cells called '''[[akinetes]]'''.  sturdy composition of akinetes are resistant to low temperature, [[desiccation]], and darkness. Often, akinetes will hibernate in sediment until environmental conditions allow germination and re-growth.<ref name= "Herrero">Herrero, A. and Flores, E. (eds.), The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics and Evolution, Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, U.K., 2008</ref>

== Neurotoxins ==
North American and European strains of '' Anabaena circinalis '' produce '''[[anatoxin-a]]''', one of the first cyanobacterial [[neurotoxins]] identified.<ref name="Cyano Metabolites">Carmichael, W. W. (1992). Cyanobacteria secondary metabolites: The cytotoxins. Journal of Applied Bacteriology, 72, 445-459.</ref> In the late 1950s, research began in earnest following several cattle deaths attributed to contaminated drinking water.<ref name="Cyano Metabolites"/> Due in part to the relatively short time from ingestion to death, the toxin was ominously coined [[Very Fast Death Factor]] (VFDF). Anatoxin-a functions as a postsynaptic [[nicotinic agonist]], binding to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junctions. However, unlike acetylcholine, anatoxin-a is not degradable by cholinesterase, resulting in a persistent muscle contraction. This disruption presents as coordination loss, paralysis, muscle twitching, shortness of breath, and possibly death.<ref name="Cyano Metabolites"/> Biological toxicity aside, '' Anabaena circinalis '' blooms have the potential to disrupt commercial fishing areas, water-treatment facilities, and recreational waterways. Add to this the high cost of toxicity monitoring, and its apparent that '' Anabaena circinalis '' can have a detrimental economic impact as well.<ref>Beltran, E. C., & Neilan, B. A. (2000). Geographical segregation of the neurotoxin-producing cyanobacterium anabaena circinalis. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, (Oct. 2000), 4468-4474.</ref> 
In some freshwater environments of Australia, '' A. circinalis '' are known to produce '''paralytic shellfish toxins''' ('''PSTs'''),<ref>Humpage A. R., Rositano J., Bretag A. H., Brown R., Baker P. D., Nicholson B. C., Steffensen D. A. (1994) Paralytic shellfish poisons from Australian cyanobacterial blooms. Aust. J. Mar. Freshwater Res. 45:761<U+2013>771.</ref> a neurotoxin also found in some marine dinoflagellates. Severe PST intoxication can result in a potentially fatal illness known as '''[[paralytic shellfish poisoning]]''' ('''PSP'''). PSTs are in a class of poisons known as the [[saxitoxin]]s, which are among the most toxic naturally produced substances. Saxitoxin poisoning begins with the blockage of sodium and potassium channels, quickly leading to a decrease in neural action potentials, flaccid paralysis, respiratory arrest, and eventually death.<ref>Kao CY, Levinson SR, eds: Tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, and the molecular biology of the sodium channel. New York: The New York Academy of Science; 1986.</ref>

==Phylogeny==
Regardless of geographic location, ''A. circinalis'' are [[monophyletic]], having evolved from a cyanobacterial ancestor approximately 1-2 billion years ago.<ref name= "Herrero"/> Because PST-producing ''A. circinalis'' is  morphologically similar to non-PST strains, attempts are being made to subdivide these populations further. Historically, PCR primers have been employed to isolate and analyze [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]], a highly conserved region of the cyanobacterial ribosomal subunit. However, newer assays focusing on base variations in rpoC1 genes have proven to be more precise at both the genus and species level. This precision provides an increasingly accurate determination of the presence or absence of PSTs among ''A. circinalis'' species.<ref>Fergusson, K. M., & Saint, C. P. (2000). Molecular phylogeny of anabaena circinalis and its identification in environmental samples by pcr. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, (Sept. 2000), 4145-4148.</ref>

==Applications==
The toxins produced by '' Anabaena circinalis '' (and similar species) occur in many different analogs, each varying in toxicity. Biotransformation experiments have shown promise in the chemical conversion of highly toxic PSTs into less toxic forms. This process may provide a way to detoxify dangerous blooms before they cause irreparable damage. Additionally, some forms of PSTs have shown promise as long-lasting anesthetics for various chronic medical conditions.<ref>Wiese, M., D'Augustino, P. M., Mihali, T. K., Moffitt, M. C., & Neilan, B. A. (2010). Neurotoxic alkaloids: Saxitonin and its analogs. Marine Drugs, (8), 2185-2211.</ref>
The United States Military has researched saxitoxin since the 1950s, naming the toxin '''''Agent TZ'''''. In 1960, while piloting the now-infamous ''''[[U-2 Incident]]'''' over Russian airspace, CIA pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]] was rumored to have had a saxitoxin "suicide pill", which he was later criticized for not using upon his capture.<ref>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Freedom of Information Act (1967). Francis gary powers: U-2 spy pilot shot down by the soviets. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of State.</ref> Military researchers have since found the aerosol dispersion of saxitoxin to have a much higher toxicity than both sarin nerve gas and ricin,<ref>Shimizu, Y.; Norte, M.; Hori, A.; Genenah, A.; Kobayashi, M. (1984). "Biosynthesis of saxitoxin analogs: The unexpected pathway". Journal of the American Chemical Society 106 (21): 6433<U+2013>6434.</ref> leading to the possibility of using saxitoxins on the battlefield. However, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC) of 1993 categorized saxitoxins as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substance]], meaning:
* Saxitoxins have the potential to be used as a biological weapon, or as a precursor to another weapon.
* Saxitoxins have no practical use outside of weapons manufacture.
As per the CWC, stockpiles of all chemical weapons, including saxitoxin, were to be destroyed by the year 2010.<ref>"U.S. Department of Commerce , Bureau of Industry and Security. (1993)." Chemical weapons convention bulletin. Washington, DC: Education, Assistance & Support.</ref>
