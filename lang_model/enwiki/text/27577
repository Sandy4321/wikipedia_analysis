===Property-rights activism===
Looper was a driving force behind opposition to a proposed [[toll road]] project along the Colorado Front Range &mdash; the Prairie Falcon Parkway Express, or "Super Slab" project &mdash; a {{convert|210|mi|km|sing=on}} highway and rail corridor stretching from [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] to [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]]. The project would have resulted in the condemnation or taking by [[eminent domain]] of privately held properties in seven Colorado counties; Looper's land fell within the corridor designated by the toll road's developers, and subsequently dropped in market value.<ref name="foes">{{cite news |first=Christiana |last=Nelson |title=Toll road idea meets firm foes |url=http://www.coloradoan.com/news/coloradoanpublishing/Legislature2005/032005_tollroad.html

==Legislative career==

===2006 election===
In February 2006, upon the retirement of term-limited Rep.

In the general election, Looper faced former [[Fountain, Colorado]] mayor and [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] Ken Barela. Barela criticized Looper's emphasis on property rights, calling her a "one issue candidate;" in response, Looper characterized Barela as "too liberal" for the district. Although she was endorsed by Republican Rep. [[David Schultheis]], she was not endorsed by Republican and outgoing Rep.
