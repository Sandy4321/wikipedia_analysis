'''''Limnos''''', sometimes spelled '''Lemnos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''<U+0398>/<U+039A> <U+039B><U+03AE><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>'''''), was a 13,000 ton [[Mississippi class battleship|''Mississippi''-class]] [[battleship]] originally built by the [[US Navy]] in 1904&ndash;1908. The [[Greek Navy]] purchased the ship in 1914 and renamed her ''Limnos'', along with her sister {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|2}}, renamed [[Greek battleship Kilkis|''Kilkis'']]. ''Limnos'' was named for the [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Battle of Limnos]], a crucial engagement of the [[First Balkan War]]. Armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} guns, ''Limnos'' and her sister were the most powerful vessels in the Greek fleet. 

The ship saw limited action during [[World War I]]. Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] opted to remain neutral until October 1916, when pressure from the [[Triple Entente]] forced him to abdicate in favor of a pro-Entente government. For the remainder of the war, ''Limnos'' operated solely as a harbor defense ship. In the aftermath of World War I, she saw service during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1919&ndash;1922. During the war with Turkey, ''Limnos'' supported Greek landings in Turkey and participated in the final Greek sea-borne withdrawal in 1922. She remained in service until 1932, when she was used as a [[barracks ship]] and subsequently disarmed. During the German invasion of Greece in 1941, she and her sister were sunk in [[Salamis]] by German [[Ju-87 Stuka]] dive-bombers. The two ships were ultimately raised and broken up for scrap after the end of the war.

Laid down on 12 May 1904, the ship was launched on 9 December 1905 and commissioned into the [[United States Navy]] on 1 April 1908 as {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|6}}.<ref name=G144>Gardiner, p. 144</ref> She served in the US Navy until 1914, when she and her sister were sold on 30 June 1914.<ref name=GG384>Gardiner & Gray, p. 384</ref> The two ships were transferred to the Greek Navy in [[Newport News]], Virginia the following month.<ref name=Hore>Hore, p. 89</ref> The ship was {{convert|382|ft}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|77|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|8|in|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|13000|MT|sp=us}} as designed and up to {{convert|14465|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The ship was powered by two-shaft vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s and eight coal-fired [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[boiler]]s rated at {{convert|10000|ihp|lk=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|17|kn|lk=in}}. [[Lattice mast]]s were installed in 1909. She had a crew of 744 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=G144/>

The ship was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|12|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns in two twin turrets, one on either end of the [[superstructure]]. Eight {{convert|8|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns were mounted in four twin turrets, two on other side of the vessel [[amidships]]. The secondary battery was rounded out with eight {{convert|7|in|abbr=on|0}} L/45 guns mounted individually in [[casemate]]s along the length of the hull. Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was protected by a battery of twelve {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} L/50 guns, six 3-pounder guns and two 1-pounder guns. The ship's armament system was completed by two {{convert|21|in|abbr=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in her hull.<ref name=G144/> ''Limnos'' and ''Kilkis'' were the most powerful vessels in the Greek Navy.<ref name=PH80>Paloczi-Horvath, p. 80</ref>

==Service history==
''Limnos'' and ''Kilkis'' quickly left the United States after their transfer in July 1914, due to the rising tensions in Europe following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] the previous month.<ref>Parramore et. al., p. 292</ref> At the outbreak of World War I in at the end of the month, Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], decided to remain neutral. The [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers landed troops in [[Salonika]] in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916.<ref name=GG383>Gardiner & Gray, p. 383</ref> ''Limnos'' was reduced to a skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed.<ref>Fotakis, p. 131</ref> Ultimately, a pro-Entente government replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. ''Limnos'', however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies,<ref name=GG383/> and instead was used solely for harbor defense until the end of the war.<ref name=PH80/>

After the end of World War I, ''Limnos'' joined the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] and served with the Crimean Expedition. There, she aided the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the Communists.<ref name=DANFS>{{cite web|title=Idaho|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/idaho-ii.htm|publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]]|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> She then saw service during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], where she supported landings to seize Ottoman territory. The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies after the end of World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Greek Navy's activities. Operations came to a close in September 1922 when the Greek Army was forced to evacuate by sea, along with a sizable number of civilians, from Asia Minor. The fleet transported a total of 250,000 soldiers and civilians during the evacuation.<ref name=GG383/> In 1932, ''Limnos'' was placed in inactive reserve; sections of her armor plate was removed to build fortifications on the island of [[Aegina]].<ref name=GG384/> She was disarmed in 1937 and thereafter used as a barracks ship.<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 404</ref> The hulk of ''Limnos'' was bombed in [[Salamis Naval Base]] by [[Ju-87 Stuka]] [[dive bomber]]s on April 23, 1941, during the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]].<ref name=GG384/> The ship was beached to prevent her from sinking; her wreck was broken up after the end of the war.<ref name=DANFS/>
