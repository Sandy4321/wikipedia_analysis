'''''Pod''''' is the name of a 2002 [[Modern art|modern]] [[sculpture]] by American artist Pete Beeman,<ref name=RACC>{{cite web|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=2003.196|title=Public Art Search: Artist: Pete Beeman, American|accessdate=June 26, 2012|publisher=[[Regional Arts & Culture Council]]}}</ref> currently installed at Southwest 10th Avenue and West Burnside Street in [[Downtown Portland|downtown]] [[Portland, Oregon]]. The 30-foot sculpture, intended to represent the "infrastructure, energy, and vibrancy of Portland", is supported by its static [[tripod]] base with a 15-foot diameter. It is constructed from [[stainless steel]], [[Hot-dip galvanizing|galvanized steel]], [[bronze]], [[titanium]], [[lead]] and other materials. ''Pod'' was fabricated by Beeman and David Bermudez, and engineered by Beeman and Peterson Structural Engineers. It is considered [[Interactive art|interactive]] and [[Kinetic art|kinetic]], with a central, vertical [[pendulum]] that swings back and forth when pushed. The sculpture cost as much as $50,000 and was funded by the [[Portland Streetcar]] Project and BBC Steel. ''Pod'' is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts & Culture Council]].<ref name=Culture>{{cite web|url=http://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=06429|title=Pod, 2002|accessdate=June 25, 2012|publisher=cultureNOW}}</ref>

==Description and history==

''Pod'' was designed by native Portland resident Pete Beeman as a [[public art]] project for the [[Portland Streetcar]].<ref name=Anderson>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/print_story.php?story_id=115947972925067800|title=Stumptown Stumper|first=Jennifer|last=Anderson|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|accessdate=June 25, 2012|date=September 29, 2006}}</ref> According to Beeman and the [[Regional Arts & Culture Council]], the [[Modern art|modern]] sculpture is designed to represent the "infrastructure, energy, and vibrancy of Portland".<ref name=Culture/><ref name=Anderson/><ref name=LaMountain>{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/opinion/story.php?story_id=17081|title=Out with the abstruse, in with relevance|first=Richard F.|last=LaMountain|date=May 16, 2003|accessdate=June 26, 2012|work=Portland Tribune|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Pamplin Media Group}}</ref> Of the work's design, Beeman said:
{{Quote|"I was thinking about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great.

In 2002, D.K. Row of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' called ''Pod'' a "complex, funny piece", comparing it to a "mechanical spider with an unlikely spine sticking in the air".<ref name=Row/> Row said the sculpture evoked the curves of sculptor [[Richard Serra]] and design style of architect [[Frank Gehry]].<ref name=Row/> Michael Powell, owner of [[Powell's Books|Powell's City of Books]] (located across the street from ''Pod''), called the sculpture "wonderful".<ref name=Bancud/> ''Pod'' has been compared to a [[scrotum]] and has even been referred to as "Satan's Testicles".<ref name=Smith/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/portlands-public-art-app_iphone-apps|title=Portland's Public Art App|accessdate=June 26, 2012|publisher=[[Thrillist]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-1949-kvetchfest_iii.html|title=Kvetchfest III: The Bitch Is Back!|accessdate=June 26, 2012|work=Willamette Week|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers|first1=Becky|last1=Ohlsen|first2=Richard|last2=Speer|date=April 16, 2003}}</ref>
