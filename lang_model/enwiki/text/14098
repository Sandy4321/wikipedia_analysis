'''The Judd School''' (often known simply as '''Judd''') is a [[voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] [[grammar school]] in [[Tonbridge]], Kent. It was established in 1888 at Stafford House on East Street in Tonbridge, where it remained for eight years before moving to its present location on Brook Street, in the south of the town. Founded by the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners]], it was named after 16th century merchant Sir Andrew Judd, whose endowment helped fund the school. The Skinners' Company maintains close links with the school and makes up the majority of the governing body.

There are 935 students in the school aged 11 to 18; the lower school is all boys, but of over 300&nbsp;students aged 16<U+2013>18 in the [[sixth form]], up to 60 are girls. The first headmaster was William Bryant, who oversaw the transition to the present site before his retirement in 1908. The headmaster as of 2010 is Robert Masters, who has occupied the post since September 2004 and is the seventh headmaster of the school.

Judd pupils generally take ten [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) tests in [[Year Eleven]] (aged 15<U+2013>16), and they have a choice of four or five [[A-level]]s in the sixth form. An [[Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills]] (Ofsted) inspection in 2007 graded The Judd School as "outstanding", and league tables published by the [[BBC]] based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent.  In 2009, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' newspaper ranked The Judd School as the 27th best state [[secondary school]] (for pupils aged 11<U+2013>16, with an optional two further years of education in sixth form) in the country. The majority of students go on to higher education following the completion of their A-levels at the end of [[Year Thirteen]] (aged 17<U+2013>18).

In September 2004, the school was designated a music and mathematics [[Specialist school|specialist school]], which means it receives additional funding for those subjects. In 2007, the school was invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music and English and science and mathematics specialist school.

==History==
===Early years: 1888<U+2013>1918===
[[File:Stafford House, East Street, Tonbridge.JPG|thumb|Stafford House on East Street, the first site of The Judd School|alt=A red bricked building with a spired roof, windows and a black door.]]
The Judd School was established in 1888, but the need for a secondary school to supplement Sir Andrew Judd's Grammar School (now known as [[Tonbridge School]]) was acknowledged as early as 1870, after it was revealed that only one in 200 of its students was the son of a Tonbridge tradesman.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 3">Taylor (1988), p. 3</ref> Tonbridge School was founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judd,{{#tag:ref|Some sources spell the name "Judde": "[1887] Sir Andrew had by now lost the final "e" of his surname".<ref>Chapman (1977)  p. 111</ref>|group="nb"}} who made a fortune in the [[Muscovy]] fur trade during the 16th century.<ref>Veale (1988), pp. 188<U+2013>189</ref> His [[Financial endowment|endowment]] was left in the hands of the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners]], who agreed to fund the establishment of a commercial school in Tonbridge in 1875.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 4">Taylor (1988), p. 4</ref><ref>Somervell (1847), p. 14</ref> However, the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commissioners]] <U+2013> empowered by the 1869 Endowed Schools Act to govern the establishment of charitably funded schools <U+2013> directed that the <U+00A3>20,000 provided by The Skinners' Company for this cause be taken to neighbouring [[Tunbridge Wells]], where it was used to establish [[The Skinners' School]] in September 1887.<ref>Rivington, p. 224</ref><ref name="Neve 1933, p. 309">Neve (1933), p. 309</ref> 

Demand persisted for a similar school in Tonbridge; in July 1888, William J. D. Bryant, previously an assistant master at Tonbridge School,<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245">Wadmore (1902), p. 245</ref> was named headmaster of Sir Andrew Judd's Commercial School,<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 10">Taylor (1988), p. 10</ref> which opened on 17&nbsp;September at Stafford House on East Street, Tonbridge.<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245"/> The funds were provided by a loan of <U+00A3>13,000 repaid over the next 20&nbsp;years with income from the Judd Foundation (of which The Skinners' Company were trustees), which rapidly increased when the leases on the Sandhills Estate in London were renewed in 1906.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 4"/><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 19">Taylor (1988), p. 19</ref><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 57"/> The school also benefited from at least <U+00A3>500 per year from the Judd Foundation, after funding for Tonbridge School was reduced.<ref>Rivington, p. 225</ref> Although established on a tentative basis,<ref name="Neve 1933, p. 309"/> the school's early success led to its move to a larger, purpose-built site in south Tonbridge in 1896.<ref name="Neve 1933, p. 309"/>

William Bryant retired as headmaster in 1908 and was replaced by John Evans, appointed in preference to the 217&nbsp;other applicants for the post.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 41">Taylor (1988), p. 41</ref> Previously headmaster of [[Ashford Grammar School]],<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 41"/> Evans took up his new position at the conclusion of the autumn term. He oversaw a period of change and modernisation, including the transition from gas to electric lighting, and the introduction of a [[house system]] in 1909.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 56</ref><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 58">Taylor (1988), p. 58</ref> Soon after the outbreak of the First World War the school was requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to house two [[brigade]]s, from [[Folkestone]] and [[Aldershot]].<ref>Taylor (1988), pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> In 1917, the school [[Cadet Corps]] was established, which within one month consisted of 120&nbsp;students.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 80">Taylor (1988), p. 80</ref> The following year, and according to Taylor (1988) "much to the Headmaster's distaste",<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 82">Taylor (1988), p. 82</ref> the first female teachers were appointed after the deaths of several male members of staff.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 82"/>

===Inter-war years: 1919<U+2013>1939===
In June 1919, soon after the passage of [[Education Act 1918]], the school successfully applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number of admissions.<ref name="Taylor 1988, pp. 56<U+2013>57">Taylor (1988), pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the [[Oxbridge]] universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 43</ref> Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164&nbsp;other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of <U+00A3>650.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 61">Taylor (1988), p. 61</ref><ref>Chapman (1977), p. 111</ref> He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 68">Taylor (1988), p. 68</ref> Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating <U+00A3>20 per year to send a [[Thomas John Barnardo|Barnardo]] boy to Australia or Canada.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 71</ref>

===Second World War: 1939<U+2013>1945===
The outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939 delayed the commencement of the Autumn Term until trenches could be dug at the school. To avoid the bombing raids, 369 students of the [[Westminster City School]] in London were evacuated to The Judd School in the relative safety of Tonbridge.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 85">Taylor (1988), p. 85</ref><ref>Taylor (1988), p. 83</ref> Initially, each school used the facilities three days per week, but Taylor (1988) notes that "imaginative timetables" enabled all Judd pupils to attend five days a week by the end of 1941.<ref>Taylor (1988), pp. 83<U+2013>85</ref> The Westminster boys were instructed to further evacuate to [[Exmouth]], Devon in July 1944, but ended up fleeing back to London.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 86</ref> In a bombing raid that same year a rocket shell exploded in a neighbouring field, destroying more than 200&nbsp;panes of glass and numerous doors and windows.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 88</ref> By the end of the war, 60&nbsp;former pupils had lost their lives, and 48&nbsp;were [[Military awards and decorations|decorated]].<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 89</ref> On 31 December 1944, The Judd School became the first in the country to be awarded the status of a voluntarily aided grammar school in new legislation brought in by the [[Butler Education Act]], which meant it received state funding, but could continue to select pupils by ability.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 93">Taylor (1988), p. 93</ref><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97">Taylor (1988), p. 97</ref>

===Post-war years: 1945<U+2013>1986===
[[File:The Judd School - Lawton's.JPG|thumb|10 Brook Street is known as Lawton's, after a former head of the Kent Education Committee who funded its purchase.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 124"/>|alt=A detached red bricked building, with two chimneys, behind a green hedge and a tree to the left.]]
Francis Hillier Taylor, previously senior history master at The Skinners' School, was appointed as Morgan's successor at the end of the spring term in 1946, a position that attracted 321 applications.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 93"/> During his tenure, Taylor significantly expanded the school facilities: in 1948, the headmaster's living quarters were converted to include a secretaries office, waiting room and medical inspection room (the headmaster moved to neighbouring Brook House, which was purchased by The Skinners' Company). In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used until two years later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 at the cost of <U+00A3>9,000.<ref>Taylor (1988), pp. 111<U+2013>113</ref> Taylor also introduced some major curriculum changes, including the introduction of new subjects such as rural biology and [[zoology]].<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 99">Taylor (1988), p. 99</ref><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 101"/>

Denis Rendall took over in 1970,<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 118</ref> at a time when the future of the school was under threat from the [[Circular 10/65]], which proposed the abolition of grammar schools, which select pupils according to their academic ability, in favour of the [[comprehensive schools]], which are non-selective state funded schools.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 123</ref> He oversaw the building of the new art and crafts department building, currently the R.E. block, which opened in May 1974, and the purchase of a neighbouring detached house, 10 Brook Street, by the Kent Education Committee. Known as "Lawton's", this building is now used by the economics and business departments and for music technology.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 124">Taylor (1988), p. 124</ref> Rendall experienced a high turnover of staff: 31 teachers were at the school in the year of his arrival, and 43 joined and left the school between 1970 and 1986. He increased the number of female staff from zero to seven during his tenure,<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 125">Taylor (1988), p. 125</ref> and the student body grew from 463 to 746 during these years.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 124"/>

===Recent years: 1986<U+2013>present===
Rendall was replaced in 1986 by Keith Starling, who further developed and expanded the school to celebrate its centenary;<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 135</ref> the <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million Cohen Building was constructed in 1991, followed by a <U+00A3>1.4&nbsp;million music centre in 1995.<ref name="Garner">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/begging-bowl-raises-millions-for-classroom-620442.html |title=Begging bowl raises millions for classroom |first=Richard |last=Garner |work=The Independent |date=17 December 2001 |accessdate=9 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref> More recent developments include the Library Building, built in 2002, and a new sports hall in 2003; much of the construction funds was raised by parents.<ref name="Garner"/><ref name="The Judd School Prospectus"/>

After Starling's retirement in 2004, Robert Masters was appointed as his replacement and oversaw the school's transition to music and maths specialist status in 2004.<ref name="The Judd School Inspection Report">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_reports/download/(id)/82983/(as)/118843_291271.pdf |title=The Judd School Inspection Report |publisher=[[Office for Standards in Education|Ofsted]] |format=PDF |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=28 July 2010 }}</ref> Following an "outstanding" result in a 2007 Ofsted inspection, the school was invited to become a High Performing Specialist School and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status.

==Governance==

The Judd School foundation document, which was approved by [[Queen Victoria]] on 15 October 1889,<ref>Wadmore (1902), p.244</ref> stipulated that the Board of Governors had right of appointment and dismissal of the headmaster, who has the same powers over the rest of the staff.<ref>Taylor (1988), pp. 141<U+2013>142</ref> Major decisions were made by the The Skinners' Company, but its powers were restricted by the Charity Commissioners, who were granted considerable powers under the Endowed Schools Act.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 3"/> Soon after the First World War, in the wake of the Education Act 1918, the Burnham Scale of teachers salaries came into force and the school was forced to enter into negotiations with the Kent Education Committee to meet the increased expenditure; the Court of The Skinners' Company approved the school becoming grant earning in June 1919. It became necessary to appoint a composite governing body, a third of them public representatives nominated by the Kent Education Committee, who also had some control over school affairs. Subsequently a fee of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] was paid to those who attended meetings of the governing body, the first of which was held on 4&nbsp;February 1920, at Skinners' Hall in London.<ref name="Taylor 1988, pp. 56<U+2013>57"/><ref name="Neve 1933, p. 311">Neve (1933), p. 311</ref>

In December 1944, after applying for voluntary aided status, the school was required to adopt new Articles of Government on 31 December; it became the first school in the country to be awarded the dual control of state funding and limited independence. The Kent Education Committee funded free dinners for some pupils, travel and maintenance grants and created a common entrance exam.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97"/> The current governing body consists of a chair and vice chair, ten foundation governors (elected by the Worshipful Company of Skinners), three parent governors, two Local Education Authority (LEA) governors, three staff governors, an education officer and clerk, education assistant, assistant clerk and the headmaster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=96115 |title=The Judd School Governing Body |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=2 August 2010 }}</ref>

==School structure==
The majority of the school's first pupils joined from Gordon House, which was a successful private school on Hadlow Road run by {{nowrap|T. E Grice}}; after it was decided that the two schools should not compete, Grice was appointed deputy headmaster of The Judd School.<ref>Neve (1933), pp. 309<U+2013>310</ref> On the opening day, 40 boys were in attendance, rising to 50 by the end of the first term and to 115 in 1902.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 7</ref><ref name="Neve 1933, p. 310">Neve (1933), p. 310</ref><ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 246"/> In 1917, the school had 244 pupils, which increased to 308 over the next 11 years, and reached 376 in 1935.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 58"/><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 61"/><ref>Taylor (1988), p. 39</ref> In 1952, 380 boys were on the roll, which included 42 sixth form students.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 100"/> Under Denis Rendall, the school experienced a strong growth in numbers;<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 124"/> in 1970, there were 463 pupils, increasing to 689 in 1978, and to 742 in 1986.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 124"/> At the last Ofsted inspection in 2007, The Judd School had 933 students.<ref name="The Judd School Inspection Report"/> According to the school, as of 2010 the student body is made up of 935 students: 625 in the lower school and 310 in the sixth form, including about 60&nbsp;girls.<ref name="The Judd School Prospectus">{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/user/74/37470.pdf |title=The Judd School Prospectus |publisher=The Judd School |format=PDF |accessdate=28 July 2010 }}</ref> Many students come from affluent backgrounds and very few require free school meals; the number of students with disabilities, learning difficulties and special educational needs is well below the national average. The majority of students go on to higher education at the end of Year Thirteen.<ref name="The Judd School Inspection Report"/>

The house system was first established in 1909, when there were three houses: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, each of which had a house master and captain. Boys remained in the same house for their entire school career, and would be joined by any siblings. Every year, the houses competed for the House Shield; points were awarded for all forms of competitions, from [[sword dancing]] to [[Vault (gymnastics)|vaulting]]. In 1914, house colours were introduced; purple for Alpha, green for Beta, and scarlet for Gamma. As the student body increased, a fourth house{{ndash}} Delta{{ndash}} was formed in 1917, for which the colour was yellow.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 58"/> The house system was abolished in the 1980s,<ref name="House System">{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=83445 |title=House System |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=28 July 2010 }}</ref> but re-introduced in September 2008, with houses named after notable alumni. The four houses, according to the official website, are: Duke (after [[Neville Duke]]), Hodge (after [[Donald Hodge (veteran)|Donald Hodge]]), Lewin (after [[Terence Lewin, Baron Lewin|Terence Lewin]]) and Powell (after [[Cecil Frank Powell]]).<ref name="House System"/>

===Lower school===
In its early years, boys entered the school mainly from local elementary (now known as primary) schools from ages eight onwards;<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 31">Taylor (1988), p. 31</ref> at that time, the maximum age of a pupil was 16, although any boy who reached this age during the course of a term was permitted to remain until the end of that term.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 142">Taylor (1988), p. 142</ref> In 1908, a government inspection noted that the average pupil remained at the school for three and a half years and left the school between the ages of 14 and 15, and that 20 percent of the intake held scholarships.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 35</ref> The lower school as it is today was first established by the "Five Year Plan" following a government inspection in 1933.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 68"/> In 1944, following the Butler Education Act, entrance to the school was gained through a common entrance exam, aged 11 or 12; five boys offered themselves for each place, and most came from local primary schools.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97"/> Prior to the establishment of the sixth form, The Judd School passed several boys to Tonbridge School, or other grammar schools, to complete their education to the age of 18 or 19; <U+00A3>20 was paid as a leaving scholarship.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 31"/>

As of 2010, the lower school has an annual intake of around 125 boys at the beginning of [[Year Seven]] (aged 11).<ref name="The Judd School">{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=94806 |title=The Judd School Admissions for 2011 Entry |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate= 28 July 2010 }}</ref>  The lower school (Years 7<U+2013>11) is 625 students (all boys) strong,<ref name="The Judd School Inspection Report"/> for whom the school uniform consists of a navy blazer accompanied with the school badge on the breast pocket, with grey trousers and a grey or white shirt. Socks must be dark, and shoes must be black.

===Sixth form===
The Judd School sixth form can be said to have been established as early as 1903{{ndash}} in the wake of the Education Act of 1902{{ndash}} when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 33">Taylor (1988), p. 33</ref> However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 57">Taylor (1988), p. 57</ref> A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 100">Taylor (1988), p. 100</ref> Judd's sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007.<ref name="The Judd School Inspection Report"/> A minimum of 40 offers per year will be made to external applicants; girls are admitted in [[Year Twelve]] (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the sixth form.<ref name="The Judd School Inspection Report"/> The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.<ref name="frog.judd.kent.sch.uk">{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/user/74/56537.pdf |title=Judd School Development Fund Newsletter |publisher= The Judd School |format=PDF |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

Boys may wear a dark grey or black suit, plain black, grey or navy V-neck sweater and a scarf of a plain colour. Girls may wear plain tailored suits (skirt or trousers) in black, navy or dark grey. Shirts may be plain grey, blue or white. There is a sixth form house tie available, although girls may choose to wear a pin badge instead.<ref name="Uniform"/>

===Staff===
In July 1904, The Judd School participated in the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an experimental basis.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 147">Taylor (1988), p. 147</ref> Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 33"/> The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 57"/> When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918.<ref name="Taylor 1988, pp. 56<U+2013>57"/> In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 125"/> According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.<ref name="Prospectus Inserts">{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/user/74/41248.pdf |title=Prospectus Inserts |format=PDF |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref>

The Judd School opened as a [[day school]] for local pupils living with their parents, between the ages of eight and 16.<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245"/><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 142"/> According to the foundation document, the conditions of entry were possession of a "good character" and "sufficient health";<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 142"/> sons of freemen of The Skinners' Company were given preference when the number of applicants exceeded the places available.<ref name="Stammers 1988, p. 32">Stammers (1988), p. 32</ref> During his tenure, William Bryant attempted to extend admission to boarders and estimated the costs to be <U+00A3>50 per term (including fees), but the Board of Governors rejected the idea.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 27">Taylor (1988), p. 27</ref> However, when a lack of public transport made day-to-day travel to the school impractical, boys were permitted to lodge from neighbouring villages and would stay at masters' homes or at hostels approved by the governors.<ref name="Stammers 1988, p. 32"/><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 27"/> Entry to the school was conditional upon a pupil passing an entrance exam, which would vary according to the age of the boy. However, the foundation document stipulated that every boy had to be able read, write from dictation and perform sums in the "first four simple rules of Arithmetic, with the multiplication table".<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 143">Taylor (1988), p. 143</ref> 

In 1944, The Butler Education Act confirmed The Judd School as a [[grammar school]], at which time it applied for voluntarily aided status, which required it to abolish fees under the principle of universal free education.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97"/> The school was required to offer entrance via an entrance examination, now known as the [[Eleven Plus]],<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97"/> which pupils take aged 10 or 11, depending on their date of birth. Provision was made for pupils to enter aged 13 or 14, for those that had failed the test two years earlier.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97"/> While defining the school-leaving age as 15, the act granted the government the power to raise the age to 16 "as soon as the Minister is satisfied that it has become practicable", which happened in 1973.<ref>[[Education Act 1944]], Section 35</ref>

Admission continues to be via the Eleven Plus examination; The Judd School complies with the Co-ordinated Admission Scheme which is administered by the Kent Local Authority. All pupils must have gained a selective place through the Eleven Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. Because the school is usually over-subscribed, priority is given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school ([[as the crow flies]]) is used as a tiebreaker.<ref name="The Judd School"/> 

Pupils are also admitted to the sixth form aged 16 or 17, for which similar criteria is applied. Students must have at least four GCSEs at grade A or above (all offers made during Year Eleven are conditional on students fulfilling this criterion). In the event of over-subscription, priority will be given to internal applicants, followed by external applicants in Local Authority Care. Students are then ranked according to their predicted or actual GCSE results, and the distance to school is again used as a tiebreaker. Should entrance be refused for any reason, parents have a statutory right of appeal, which is heard by the governors of the school.<ref name="The Judd School"/> In 2007, the school was ordered to pay compensation to two pupils after it was deemed that they did not receive fair appeals because of what the Local Government Ombudsman deemed "inappropriate links" between the appeals panel and the governors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/grammar-schools-pay-compensation-to-parents-over-unfair-appeals-hearings-399445.html |title=Grammar schools pay compensation to parents over 'unfair' appeals hearings |first=Richard |last=Garner |work=The Independent |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>

===Fees===
The foundation document stipulated that fees were to be fixed by the governors and could range from <U+00A3>4<U+2013>8 per year;<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 142"/> in 1888, the fees charged were <U+00A3>7/10s per year.<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245"/> Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships to the value of the tuition fees for one in every ten boys in the school; one half of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and be awarded only to boys who had spent three years education in a public elementary school.<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 246">Wadmore (1902), p. 246</ref> Around the turn of the 20th&nbsp;century, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from <U+00A3>2/20[[shilling|s]] to <U+00A3>2 per term.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 28</ref>

In July 1919, the school applied for grant-earning status, and as a result 25&nbsp;percent of the places became free. As part of this change, the fee structure was changed to <U+00A3>3/10s per term, or ten guineas per annum.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 57"/> In 1944, in accordance with the Butler Education Act, fees were abolished under the principle of universal free education.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 97"/> Parents are encouraged to contribute to The Judd School Development Fund, which raises money for future construction projects.<ref name="frog.judd.kent.sch.uk"/> Parents who cannot contribute are required to write a letter of explanation to the headmaster.<ref name="Sixth Form Prospectus">{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/user/74/70342.pdf |title=Sixth Form Prospectus |publisher=The Judd School |format=PDF |accessdate=2 August 2010 }}</ref>

==Curriculum==
The first prospectus promised "religious instruction in accordance with the principles of the Christian Faith" and the following subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, English (grammar, composition, and literature), Latin, at least one other foreign European language, mathematics, [[book-keeping]], natural science, drawing, [[Physical Education|drill]], and vocal music. It also said that instruction may also be given "in the use of tools for working in wood",<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 143"/> for which a carpentry shed was placed in the yard of Stafford House.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 16</ref> At the turn of the 20th&nbsp;century, 15 subjects were taught and lessons lasted one hour; school began at nine, and the day included 15 minutes of hymns, prayers and roll calls.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 25">Taylor (1988), p. 25</ref>

German was first introduced into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 67">Taylor (1988), p. 67</ref> F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology was added to the curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land to be used as a vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 99"/> However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 100"/> In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at [[O-level]] (now replaced by the GCSE).<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 101">Taylor (1988), p. 101</ref>

As of 2010, the school follows the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] in Years 7<U+2013>11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14<U+2013>16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16<U+2013>18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career and Year Eleven students participate in a nine-day work experience programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=90714 |title=The Judd Careers Department |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=2 August 2010 }}</ref> The curriculum comprises English and drama, mathematics, French, Latin, history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology, art, music, design technology, religious education, physical education (P.E.) and games and personal, social and health education. In the second year German is added and in mathematics, students are divided by their ability. The use of information technology is central to all teaching and is taught as a discrete subject in Years 7 and 8. Boys usually take ten subjects for GCSE, English (language and literature), mathematics, a foreign language, all three separate sciences or Dual Certificate Science, supplemented by three other subjects from those listed above.<ref name="Prospectus Inserts"/>

In the sixth form, pupils study five AS-level (the equivalent of half an [[A-level]] qualification) subjects for one year, which may include general studies and usually continue with three or four subjects to A-level. A wide choice of subjects is offered at A-level: English, French, German, Latin, classical civilisation, art, design and technology, music, geography, history, economics, government and politics, business studies, mathematics, further mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, religious studies and P.E. Most combinations of subjects can be accommodated. All students participate in a games activity on a Wednesday afternoon.<ref name="Prospectus Inserts"/><ref name="Sixth Form Prospectus"/>

The school year runs from September to July, split across three terms called the autumn term (September to December), spring term (January to April) and the summer term (April to July). Students receive two weeks off for Christmas and Easter, a six-week summer break, and three "half term" breaks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=123547 |title=Term Dates |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=2 August 2010 }}</ref> 

===Examination===
Until the establishment of the [[General Certificate of Education]], exams were set once a year by an external examiner(s) appointed by the governors, who reported in writing on the general proficiency of pupils, as well as the condition of the school.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 143"/>  A 1902 report by examiner Dr Wormell found that the curriculum was "sufficient to help those few capable of rising to something higher by providing a bridge between elementary school and grammar school". He criticised the absence of German tuition and the fact that more than half the students came "feebly taught from country districts".<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 25"/> The headmaster would also submit a written report to the governors.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 143"/> 

In 1951, the school adopted the General Certificate of Education, but students were barred from taking any exams before the age of 16, which meant that many students left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 100"/> The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 100"/> As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/09/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/886_4622.stm |title=Performance results for The Judd School |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 August 2010 | date=15 January 2009}}</ref> Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5&nbsp;percent in 1970, peaking at 95&nbsp;percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92&nbsp;percent in 1987.

==Extra-curricular activities==
School clubs and societies include various language clubs, sport clubs, musical activities, politics and debating societies, a Voluntary Service Unit, Young Enterprise and many others. Students may also participate in the [[Duke of Edinburgh<U+2019>s Award]] Scheme.<ref name="The Judd School Prospectus"/> Now defunct school societies have included a Young Farmers Club, Jazz Society, Science Society, Stamp Club, Literary and Debating Society, and the League of Nations Union.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 103<U+2013>104</ref><ref>Taylor (1988), p. 73</ref>

Extra-curricular musical opportunities include: Choir, Junior Singers, Chamber Choir, Judd Brass, Big Bands, String Orchestra, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Junior Orchestra; students give up to 40 concerts per year. Instrumental lessons are available through the school, for which a charge is made.<ref name="The Judd School Prospectus"/> Organised drama at the school began at the latest in 1929, with performances including ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 70</ref> Despite the minimum of theatrical equipment and the awkward design of the schoolroom, where performances are staged, Taylor (1988) notes that "much has been achieved" and at times the headmaster himself took leading roles.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 132</ref><ref>Taylor (1988), p. 105</ref> 

The school cadet corps, a national program now known as the [[Combined Cadet Force]], was formed towards the end of 1917 and 120 cadets were recruited within a month.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 80"/> The governors provided <U+00A3>25 towards their initial expenses, and volunteers contributed haversacks, water bottles, dummy rifles and trips to summer camp. Training initially took place on the Tonbridge School rifle range. By 1952, the number of volunteer cadets had fallen to 90.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 101"/> During the 1970s, numbers averaged about 150 cadets.<ref>Taylor (1988), p. 133</ref> The school's Combined Cadet Force currently comprises both an Army and an [[Royal Air Force]] Section with a total establishment strength of 120 cadets, who meet on Friday afternoons following a full school day. Membership remains voluntary, and boys can join from [[Year Nine]] (aged 13<U+2013>14).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=122315 |title=The Judd School Combined Cadet Force |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=2 August 2010 }}</ref>

===Sport===
[[File:The Judd School - Playing Fields.JPG|thumb|Playing fields to the west of the Brook Street site, with view of the Library Building and the Sports Hall |alt=A grass playing field with buildings and tennis courts in the background.]]
At lower school level, there are regular games for "A" and "B" teams in most sports, so that many of the students have the chance to represent the school; in Year Seven there are even "C", "D", "E" and "F" rugby matches from time to time. There is also a programme of inter-house competitions, including one designed specifically for those who are not school team players. The main games are rugby football, cross-country and basketball during the winter months, and cricket, tennis and athletics during the summer term.<ref name="The Judd School Prospectus"/>

The school adopted the rugby code of football in 1923, at which time it was played on soccer pitches; the first games against other schools were played during the 1925<U+2013>26 season, and rugby was played by all students by 1927.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 51">Taylor (1988), p. 51</ref> As of 2010, "A" and "B" Ruby teams play against the likes of Tonbridge School, [[RGS High Wycombe]], and local grammar schools. Boys are often rewarded for their efforts with international tours and [[rugby sevens]] is also played at the school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=83321 |title=Rugby |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}</ref> In the 2008<U+2013>09 season the under-15 rugby team  advanced to the final of the national schools [[Daily Mail Cup]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] on 1 April 2009 but lost 11<U+2013>34 to Millfield.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/news/Judd-boys-Joseph-proud-despite-loss/article-867378-detail/article.html |title=Judd boys do Joseph proud despite loss |work=This Is Kent |date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=2 August 2010 }}</ref> [[Association Football|Football]] had been played at the school since its foundation and in 1908, despite the inadequacy of the school's pitches, was the primary winter game.

Burgess (2000) notes that The Judd School has a "fine reputation for its cricket teams",<ref name="Burgess 2000, p. 42">Burgess (2000), p. 42</ref> and as the primary summer game, the sport remains popular today.<ref name="Burgess 2000, p. 42"/> During the 1890s, the cricket balls used by the team were made in Tonbridge.<ref name="Burgess 2000, p. 42"/> The Judd School offers cricket academies from [[Year Eight]] (aged 12<U+2013>13) onwards, with training available all year round in the four indoor nets within the Sports Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=83339 |title=Cricket |publisher=The Judd School |accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref> In 2004, the school's [[Cross country running|cross country]] team became the first school in a decade to end the dominance of [[Public school (UK)|public school]]s [[Winchester College]] and [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]] at the Knole run in [[Sevenoaks]].<ref name="Times">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article993014.ece |last=Goodbody |first=John |work=The Times | date=12 January 2004 |title=Judd thrive in mud to break Knole Run stranglehold |accessdate=19 February 2009 | location=London}}</ref> The school cross country squad have an annual training camp in [[Lanzarote]] in December, which acts as both a reward for effort and a valuable warm-weather training camp in preparation for January's Knole Run.<ref name="Times"/> The school holds weekly matches against local schools as well as competing in the National Schools Cup at both junior and Intermediate level.

==Property==
===Stafford House===
Upon its foundation, when{{ndash}} according to Green (1990){{ndash}} it was said to be a "temporary expedient", the school was based at Stafford House, on East Street in the centre of Tonbridge.<ref name="Green 1990, p. 22">Green (1990), p. 22</ref> Previously used by private tutor Isaac Fleming in 1878,<ref name="Stammers 1988, p. 32"/> it was a building whose central urban position was, Taylor (1988) said, a "major asset, and possibly the only one"; Headmaster Bryant "bore its numerous shortcomings, its bricked ambience and grasslessness".<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 15"/> Positioned in a narrow street and originally designed for 20 boarders, traffic noise, awkward arrangement and low pitch of the classrooms and the distance of the school from its playing fields made the building far from ideal. It underwent repairs and alterations to the value of <U+00A3>300, carried out by a local builder; several partition walls were knocked down to form larger rooms, although this still restricted the bench length in even the widest of the rooms to {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}, and 18 pupils.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 15">Taylor (1988), p. 15</ref> The floor of the main schoolroom was restored and lavatory closets and urinals were installed. Later, a carpentry shed was placed in the yard, and a "Mr Russell" was appointed as its first occupant in October 1889. "Mr Beeching's field" was used{{ndash}} at what Taylor (1988) considered "an extortionate sum"{{ndash}} for games, but it was unavailable for four months of the year when it was used to grow hay.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 19"/> Beeching ended this arrangement in April 1889, at which time the school used the {{convert|5|acre|ha|adj=on}} YMCA field, for <U+00A3>20 per year. In June of that year, a shed to house cricket equipment was constructed at the cost of <U+00A3>13/10s. It was soon decided that there was a need for more "wholesome" surroundings, and it was generally accepted that south Tonbridge would be more suitable for the development of a new school.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 19"/>

===Brook Street site===
After Bloodshotts field (the current location of [[Tonbridge Grammar School]]) was rejected as an inferior site, "Mr Deacon's Field" on Haysden Lane (now Brook Street) was acquired from Sir Edmund Hardinge's trustees for <U+00A3>240 per acre, a total of <U+00A3>2,059.<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245"/><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 23">Taylor (1988), p. 23</ref> At one point owned by Sir Andrew Judd, the site consisted of {{convert|8|acre|ha}} of land, which according to Taylor (1988) sloped "gently from the road to the rear of the site".<ref name="Neve 1933, p. 310"/><ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 20">Taylor (1988), p. 20</ref><ref>Boorman & Maskell (1969), p. 82</ref> Plans, by Campbell Jones, were submitted to the headmaster in July 1983;<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245"/> they included a covered playground, red-bricked buildings incorporating local sandstone, Broseley roof tiles and a small basement housing a boiler. The construction was carried out by Messrs Turners of Watford, and total construction costs were <U+00A3>8,637.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 20"/><ref name="Burgess 2000, p. 36">Burgess (2000), p. 36</ref>{{#tag:ref|Other estimates put the aggregate spending, including land, buildings, and equipment at <U+00A3>12,000.<ref name="Neve 1933, p. 311"/>|group="nb"}} Nearly two years later, on 27&nbsp;April 1895, the Foundation Stone was laid, at which time Lewis Boyd Sebastian, Master of The Skinners' Company performed a small ceremony.<ref name="Wadmore 1902, p. 245"/> Opened in March 1896, the building featured an oak [[Neo-Georgian]] fleche surmounting an [[Oregon]] pine hammer-beamed roof. The principle entrance was carved by Messrs Lornie of London and featured shields bearing the coat of arms of Sir Andrew Judd and the company, the only architectural flourish allowed by the low budget.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 23"/>

In addition to the "schoolroom", which was larger than the Town Public Hall, the building consisted of a dining hall (cum gymnasium), the masters common room to the east and a block of six classrooms to the west.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 23"/> The headmaster's house was completed at the same time as the main school building, and had five bedrooms wired with electric bells, and a bathroom plumbed with hot and cold water.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 23"/> In November 1920, an organ was built at a cost of over <U+00A3>1,000, and placed in the schoolroom as a memorial to the old boys and masters who died in the First World War.<ref name="Neve 1933, p. 311"/> A new gymnasium was constructed after a 1956 survey deemed its predecessor economically irreparable. Accompanied by the construction of three hard tennis courts, it was opened by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1958, but lacked adjoining changing rooms, washing facilities and office facilities for members of the physical education staff.<ref>Taylor (1988), pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref>

Now known as "Lawton's", 10&nbsp;Brook&nbsp;Street was purchased during the early 1970s using funds provided by the Kent Education Committee, after whose chairman the building is now named.<ref name="Taylor 1988, p. 124"/> A <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million classroom and technology building (the "Cohen Building"), together with two new science laboratories, was opened in 1991. A new music centre, financed by voluntary donations, was opened in 1995 and a schoolroom annexe followed in 1997.

===Yeoman's fields===
The "Yeoman's fields" site was purchased after a government inspection in 1933 recommended the school seek more land. The site consists of {{convert|6.8|acre|ha}} of level, dry land that requires little conditioning, making it ideal for the full-sized rugby pitches, which came into regular use in 1935. Previously part of meadlow land termed the "Townlands", it was purchased by the Kent Education Committee from the Town Wardens and soon equipped with hedges, lavatories and a pavilion.
