'''Ana<U+00EF>s Nin''' ({{IPA-es|ana<U+02C8>is <U+02C8>nin}}; born  '''Angela Ana<U+00EF>s Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell''') (February 21, 1903, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] <U+2013> January 14, 1977) was a [[France|French]] [[author]] who became famous for her published [[diary|journal]]s, which span more than 60 years, beginning when she was 11 years old and ending shortly before her death. Nin is also famous for her [[erotic literature|erotica]].  

==Early life==
Ana<U+00EF>s Nin was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], [[France]], to two artistic parents. Her father, [[Joaqu<U+00ED>n Nin]], was a [[Cuba]]n<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFDE1238F931A15756C0A962958260 "Her Catalan-Cuban father was a celebrated pianist and composer"]</ref><ref>[http://www.enotes.com/salem-lit/diary-anais-nin "Joaquin Nin, a prominent Catalan-Cuban pianist and composer"]</ref> pianist and composer, and her mother Rosa Culmell<ref>[http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/anaisnin.htm Ana<U+00EF>s Nin]</ref> was  a classically trained Cuban singer<ref>[http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2001_03_anaisnin.html The Unique Anais Nin]"</ref>  of [[French people|French]] and [[Danish people|Danish]] ancestry. Her paternal great-grandfather had fled France during the Revolution, going first to [[Haiti]], then [[New Orleans]], and finally to Cuba where he helped build that country's first railway.<ref>''Diaries, Volume 1, 1931<U+2013>1934''</ref> After her parents separated, her mother moved Ana<U+00EF>s and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaquin Nin-Culmell]], from [[Barcelona]] to [[New York City]]. According to her diaries, ''Volume One, 1931&ndash;1934'', Nin abandoned formal schooling at the age of 16 and began working as a [[model (person)|model]]. 

On March 3, 1923, in [[Havana, Cuba]], Nin married her first husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] (1898<U+2013>1985), a banker and artist, later known as "Ian Hugo" when he became a filmmaker of [[experimental film]]s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to [[Paris]] the following year, where Guiler pursued his [[banking]] career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called ''[[D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study]]''. She also explored the field of [[psychotherapy]], studying under the likes of [[Otto Rank]], a disciple of [[Sigmund Freud]]. 

Nin left Paris in the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the upcoming war and returned to New York City with Guiler (who is, on his own wish, all but edited out of her published diaries and whose role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge). During the war, Nin sent her books to Frances Steloff of the [[Gotham Book Mart]] in New York for safekeeping.<ref>[http://www.anaisnin.com/history/Steloff.html Frances Steloff]</ref>

==Personal life==
According to her diaries,''Vol.1, 1931<U+2013>1934'', Nin shared a [[bohemian style|bohemian]] lifestyle with [[Henry Miller]] during her time in Paris. Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol.1<U+2013>2) although the opening of Vol.1 makes it clear that she is married. Nin appeared in the [[Kenneth Anger]] film ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]'' (1954) as [[Astarte]]; in the [[Maya Deren]] film ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946); and in ''Bells of Atlantis'' (1952), a film directed by Guiler under the name "Ian Hugo" with a soundtrack of [[electronic music]] by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]]. 

In 1947, at the age of 44, she met and began living with [[Rupert Pole]] (1919<U+2013>2006), sixteen years her junior. On March 17, 1955, she married him at [[Quartzsite, Arizona]], returning with Pole to live in California.<ref>Bair biography, 1995 and IMDB.</ref> Guiler remained in New York City and was unaware of Nin's second marriage until after her death in 1977.

After Guiler's death in 1985, the [[expurgation|unexpurgated]] versions of her journals were commissioned by Pole.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-pole26jul26,0,7114784.story?coll=la-home-headlines The Ranger Who Told All About Anais Nin's Wild Life]</ref>

Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations.  She states in Volume One of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Val<U+00E9>ry]], and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].

Nin once worked at Lawrence R. Maxwell Books located at [[45 Christopher Street]].<ref>Recollections of Ana<U+00EF>s Nin, Ohio University Press, 1996, &lrm; p. 6.</ref>

==Journals==
Ana<U+00EF>s Nin is perhaps best remembered as a [[diarist]]. Her journals, which span several decades, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially [[Otto Rank]]. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.

Previously unpublished works are coming to light in A Caf<U+00E9> in Space, the Anais Nin Literary Journal, which most recently includes "Anais Nin and Joaqu<U+00ED>n Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony<U+2014>Letters between a father and daughter."

==Erotic writings==
Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of female erotica. She was one of the first women to  explore fully the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in modern Europe to write erotica. Before her, erotica written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]].  

According to Volume I of her diaries, 1931<U+2013>1934, published in 1966 (Stuhlmann), Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: "One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America<U+2026> They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits<U+2026> I had my degree in erotic lore."

Faced with a desperate need for money, Nin and Miller began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous "collector" for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.<ref>{{cite web|title=DELTA OF VENUS, by Ana<U+00EF>s Nin<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.geocities.com/arsenio_grilo/a_nin_1.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5knBgSwxc|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' and ''[[Little Birds]]''.

Nin was a friend, and in some cases lover, of many leading literary figures, including [[Henry Miller]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[James Agee]], and [[Lawrence Durrell]]. Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both as a woman and an author. The rumor that Nin was [[bisexual]] was given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry & June]]''. This rumor is dashed by at least two encounters Nin writes about in her third unexpurgated journal, ''Fire''. The first is with a patient of Nin's (Nin was working as a psychoanalyst in [[New York]] at the time), Thurema Sokol, with whom nothing physical occurs. She also describes a m<U+00E9>nage <U+00E0> trois in a hotel, and while Nin is attracted to the other woman, she does not respond completely (229<U+2013>31). Nin confirms that she is not bisexual in her unpublished 1940 diary when she states that although she could be attracted erotically to some women, the sexual act itself made her uncomfortable. What is irrefutable is her sexual attraction to men.

Nin's first unexpurgated journal, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear, despite the notion to the contrary, that she did not have sexual relations with Miller's wife, June. While Nin was stirred by June to the point where she says (paraphrasing), "I have become June," she did not consummate her erotic feelings for her. Still, to both Anais and Henry, June was a femme fatale<U+2014>irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, oftentimes leaving herself broke. In her second unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote that she had an [[incest]]uous relationship with her father, which was graphically described (207<U+2013>15). When Nin's father learned of the title of her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'', he feared that the true nature of their relationship would be revealed, when, in fact, it was heavily veiled in Nin's text.

==Later life and legacy==
In 1973 Ana<U+00EF>s Nin received an honorary [[doctorate]] from the [[Philadelphia College of Art]]. She was elected to the United States [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1974.  She died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on January 14, 1977; her body was [[cremation|cremated]], and her ashes were scattered over [[Santa Monica Bay]]. Rupert Pole was named Nin's [[literary executor]], and he arranged to have new unexpurgated editions of Nin's books and diaries published between 1985 and his death in 2006. 

[[Philip Kaufman]] directed the 1990 film ''[[Henry & June]]'' based on Nin's novel ''[[Henry and June|Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Ana<U+00EF>s Nin]]''. She was portrayed in the film by [[Maria de Medeiros]].

==Quotes==
*"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage."
*"Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing."
*"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."
*"If what Proust says is true, that happiness is the absence of fever, then I will never know happiness. For I am possessed by a fever for knowledge, experience, and creation."
*"For me, the adventures of the mind, each inflection of thought, each movement, nuance, growth, discovery, is a source of exhilaration."
*"It takes courage to push yourself to places that you have never been before, to test your limits, to break through barriers. And the day came when the risk it took to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom."
*"How wrong is it for a woman to expect man to build the world she wants, rather than set out to create it herself."
*"Creation which cannot express itself becomes madness."
*"Shame is the lie someone told you about yourself."
*"Eroticism is one of the basic means of self-knowledge, as indispensable as poetry."
*"Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death."
*"The only abnormality is the inability to love."
*"I postpone death by living, by suffering, by error, by risking, by giving, by losing."
*"Each friend represents a world in us, a world not possibly born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born."
*"I am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically, musically, in whom feelings are much stronger as reason. I am so thirsty for the marvelous that only the marvelous has power over me. Anything I cannot transform into something marvelous, I let go. Reality doesn't impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls."
*"We don't have a language for the senses. Feelings are images, sensations are like musical sounds."
*"The body is an instrument which only gives off music when it is used as a body. Always an orchestra, and just as music traverses walls, so sensuality traverses the body and reaches up to ecstasy."
*"Something is always born of excess: great art was born of great terror, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them."
*"Dreams are necessary to life."
*"Each contact with a human being is so rare, so precious, one should preserve it."
*"The dream was always running ahead of me. To catch up, to live for a moment with it, that was the miracle."
*"Love is the axis and breath of my life."
