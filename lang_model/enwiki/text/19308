==Life==
Ehsan Jami was born on April 20, 1985 in [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]] and was raised there. His father is a [[Physician|doctor]]. His mother converted, later in her life, to [[Christianity]]. As son of a doctor, Jami enjoyed substantial privileges in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. In an interview, Jami stated: "My grandparents were Muslim, but my father was non-religious."<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.voorburg.pvda.nl/download.do/id/100026941/cd/true/ Ehsan Jami: <U+201C>I'm a social democrat to the bone<U+201D>], De Rode Reiger, 2004.</ref> Yet in a different interview, he described his father as Muslim.<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.trouw.nl/deverdieping/dossiers/article735774.ece "I don't want evolution, I want revolution"], Dagblad Trouw, 2007.</ref> Political engagement by Jami's father forced the family to leave the country. Together with his parents and his older sister, the then nine year old Jami arrived in the Netherlands in 1994,<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.ehsanjami.pvda.nl/renderer.do/clearState/true/menuId/393001/returnPage/393076/ Wie is Ehsan?]. ''www.pvda.nl''. Retrieved August 17, 2007.</ref> later obtaining [[Dutch nationality law|Dutch nationality]].

==Career==
Jami studied Management Science for one and a half year in the Netherlands and joined the [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour party]] as member in 2003. He was elected to the city council of [[Leidschendam-Voorburg]] in the local elections of March 2006.

After [[9/11]] in 2001, Jami started reading the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]], after which he decided he was unsure about what he believed in and decided to leave the religion altogether.  Elsevier, 23 June 2007.</ref> Together with [[Loubna Berrada]] (founder of the Advisory Committee for Integration, part of the [[right-wing]] [[VVD|Liberal party]]), Jami founded the [[Central Committee for Ex-Muslims]] in 2007.<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.spitsnet.nl/nieuws.php/1/3259/online Ehsan Jami fights for freedom of religion], Sp!ts, 6 May 2007.</ref> The organisation, supported by [[Afshin Ellian]], aims to support [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates of Islam]]. Berrada left the committee shortly after it was founded because she felt Jami challenged Islam itself too much, saying: "I don't wish to confront Islam itself. I only want to spread the message that Muslims should be allowed to leave Islam behind without being embarrassed"<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/71475/Oprichtster-stapt-voorlopig-uit-comit%C3%A9-ex-moslims.html Founder leaves committee], De Pers, 12 June 2007.</ref>  

On 4 August 2007, Jami was attacked in his hometown [[Voorburg]] by three men because of his political involvement. The attack is widely believed to be linked to his activities for the committee. The national anti-terrorism coordinator's office, the public prosecution department and the police decided during a meeting on 6 August that "additional measures" were necessary for the protection of Jami who has subsequently received extra security.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=42621 Extra security for Ehsan Jami], Expatica.com,  7 August 2007.</ref>

In September 2007, he penned an op-ed together with PVV politician [[Geert Wilders]] for the Dutch daily [[Volkskrant]], likening the threat of Islam the rise of Adolf Hitler's National Socialism in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news | title = Jami writes opinion piece with Wilders | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=44322 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2007-09-27}}</ref> It was a response to national terrorist coordinator Tjibbe Joustra's remarks in [[Algemeen Dagblad]], who criticized the tone used by some people in the discussion about Islam.<ref>{{cite news | title = Concern about anti-Islam comments | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=44186 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2007-09-27}}</ref>

On October 4, 2007, Jami announced that he was working on a film project due to be released in February 2008 which he felt could be comparable in terms of controversy to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].<ref>{{nl icon}}{{cite news | title = Yoeri Albrecht en Joost Eerdmans in een spraakmakend gesprek met Ehsan Jami | url = http://www.hetgesprek.nl/archief/17/ | publisher = Het Gesprek | date = 2007-10-04}}</ref> On 31 March 2008 he cancelled this project after being urged to do so by [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Dutch Minister of Justice]] [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]] and threats from Iran.<ref>[http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article521586.ece/Jami_ziet_af_van_animatiefilm_tegen_islam] (in Dutch)</ref>

However, after months of deliberation, Jami again decided to release the film. The short film was released on 9 December 2008 and may be viewed [http://tundratabloid.blogspot.com/2008/12/ehsan-jamis-interview-with-muhammed.html here]. The announcement was followed by calls from European Islamic organizations for boycott of Dutch products.<ref>{{nl icon}}{{cite news | title = 'Boycot Nederlandse producten om film Jami'  | url = http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/nederland/article1909934.ece/_Boycot_Nederlandse_producten_om_film_Jami_.html | publisher = de Verdieping Trouw | date = 2008-11-26}}. Translated by [http://islamineurope.blogspot.com/2008/11/netherlands-new-mohammad-movie.html Islam in Europe]</ref> Dutch Premier Jan Peter Balkenende issued an apology for Jami's film.

After expressing strong opinions against [[Islam]], strong criticism of the PvdA,<ref>http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2007/08/jami_attacks_labour_leader.php</ref> and comparing the Islamic Prophet Muhammad with [[Adolf Hitler]], he was asked to give up his council membership as part of the PvdA.<ref>[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2007/10/exmuslim_jami_asked_to_quit_co.php Ex-Muslim Jami asked to quit council seat]</ref> By refusing to resign and continuing as an independent member, he lost his membership of PvdA.

Jami was allegedly cited in the writings of Norwegian terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]].<ref>http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/07/norway_shooter_made_many_refer_1.php</ref>

==Awards==
On 4 March 2009 ''De Telegraaf'' reported that Jami would receive the Danish Free Press Award on 14 March 2009.

==Criticism==
Co-founder Berrada quit the committee in June 2007 because she felt Jami acts too aggressively towards the entire religion of Islam, stating: "I don't wish to confront Islam itself. I only want to spread the message that Muslims should be allowed to leave Islam behind without being threatened" [http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/71475/Oprichtster-stapt-voorlopig-uit-comit%C3%A9-ex-moslims.html]
