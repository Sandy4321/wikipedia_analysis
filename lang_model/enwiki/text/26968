'''Christopher Gilbert P<U+00E9>rez''' (born August 14, 1969), better known as '''Chris P<U+00E9>rez''', is an American guitarist, songwriter and author. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the [[Tejano music|Tejano]] band [[Selena y Los Dinos]]. He married the lead frontwoman of the group, [[Selena]], on April 2, 1992. P<U+00E9>rez was born and grew up in [[San Antonio, Texas]] to Gilbert P<U+00E9>rez and Carmen Cadena. In middle school, P<U+00E9>rez was taught to play the [[French horn]] and eventually decided that he wanted to play the electric guitar, a move that his mother disapproved. Because of her reaction towards his decision, P<U+00E9>rez moved in with his father. Tony Lares tried to convince P<U+00E9>rez to join his cousin, [[Shelly Lares]], band in 1986. P<U+00E9>rez accepted the offer, despite hating Tejano music, which she performed. By the late 1980s, P<U+00E9>rez had a positive reception among Tejano musicians for playing a guitar well. This caught [[A.B. Quintanilla III]]'s attention, who was seeking another guitarist for the band he produced, [[Selena y Los Dinos]]. After accepting the offer, P<U+00E9>rez began having romantic feelings for the lead vocalist, Selena.

Selena's father, [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], began noticing their behavior and forced them to end their relationship based on the fact that P<U+00E9>rez was a rocker and his image could be damaging to Selena's career. They ignored his warnings that he will disband the group, and continued on their relationship. Within a few months, Abraham couldn't take the fact that they liked each other and forced them to end their relationship, which caused an argument between the three. Abraham went as far as firing P<U+00E9>rez from the band and not allowing Selena to go with him. They later eloped and Abraham accepted the relationship. P<U+00E9>rez was given his position back in the band by Abraham who believed he forced them to elope and felt guilty of their decision. P<U+00E9>rez was invited to help write several of Selena's songs along with A.B. and other members of the band. He also incorporated the use of his guitar to piece out [[melody|melodies]] and fused different music genres into their songs.

In the early 1990s, P<U+00E9>rez was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] and exceeding the speed limit in San Antonio. He was later released and not charged, as one of the police officers argue that he ensued a [[high-speed chase]] when the event occurred. Within months of his first arrest, P<U+00E9>rez was involved in a trashed hotel room. He and two members of Selena y Los Dinos were intoxicated and began wrestling throughout the room, breaking the door and punching holes in the walls. Abraham gave P<U+00E9>rez a second chance after he told him that he would pay for everything. In March 1995, Selena and Abraham held a meeting to discuss [[Yolanda Saldivar]]'s involvement in missing funds from the singer's [[Selena Etc.|boutiques]] and fan club, which she headed. P<U+00E9>rez and Selena tried, throughout the month, to retrieve missing documents for tax purposes. On the morning of March 31, 1995, Selena met up with Saldivar and ended a five-year working relationship with her. As she turned to leave, Saldivar drew a pistol from her purse and shot Selena in the back. Selena was pronounced dead several hours later at a nearby hospital.

The [[Murder of Selena|death of Selena]] caused a negative reaction on P<U+00E9>rez, who began abusing drugs and alcohol. Family members began noticing his rapid lost of weight and became depressed for several months. For two years, P<U+00E9>rez tried to seclude himself from anyone and kept to himself. In 1998, he met Venessa Villanueva through his friend John Garza, and began dating her. That same year, P<U+00E9>rez formed the Chris P<U+00E9>rez Band and began writing songs for their debut album. They signed with [[Hollywood Records]] and released their first album, ''[[Resurrection (Chris P<U+00E9>rez album)|Resurrection]]'', which won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album]]. The band disbanded after their second album, ''[[Una Noche Mas]]'' (2002), was released. P<U+00E9>rez and Villanueva had two kids<U+2014>Cassie and Noah P<U+00E9>rez<U+2014>before ending their relationship in 2008. P<U+00E9>rez continued in the music business and often played with A.B.'s group, [[Kumbia Kings]] and [[Kumbia All-Starz]]. He left the group and formed another band the Chris P<U+00E9>rez Project in 2010, which included Puerto Rican singer Angel Ferrer. Ferrer and P<U+00E9>rez released their first single, "Todo es Diferente" in 2011. The following year, P<U+00E9>rez wrote a book about how he and Selena first met and their relationship entitled ''To Selena, With Love''. The book received a positive reception among critics and gained approval from fans.

Cadena, who worked as a payroll clerk, suffered from depression and was seen constantly crying while cleaning dishes and when she was alone in her room.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=32}} In 1974, when P<U+00E9>rez was four years old, his parents filed for divorce.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=32}} While growing up, P<U+00E9>rez enjoyed salt water fishing with his father.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=44}} When P<U+00E9>rez was in middle school he learned how to play the [[French horn]] and joined his school's choir with support from his mother. He eventually decided that he would like to play the electric guitar, which he learned through osmosis. His mother disproved because of the negative stereotypes associated with being a rocker.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=33}} His mother later remarried in the early 1990s.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=98}} P<U+00E9>rez's favorite musicians growing up were [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]], [[Def Leppard]],{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=15}} [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]],{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=133}} the [[Scorpions]],{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=229}} [[Ozzy Osborne]] and [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name="latimes"/> P<U+00E9>rez admired [[Ricky Martin]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=116}}

When P<U+00E9>rez was seventeen years old, he wanted to runaway to Los Angeles and start a rock band. At the time he was sharing an apartment with his father and was working at a library to pay for his rent.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=15}} P<U+00E9>rez was asked by Tony Lares to join his cousin Shelly Lares' band in 1986. Tony confirmed to P<U+00E9>rez that Shelly performs [[Tejano music]]<U+2014>a mixture of traditional [[Music of Mexico|Mexican folk]] music, [[polka]]s, and [[country western]] sung in Spanish, sometimes with English lyrics<U+2014>which P<U+00E9>rez disliked. He expressed in his book, ''To Selena, With Love'' (2012), that the process of joining Shelly's band was "foot-dragging resistance." However, Shelly's band was offering him more money than his job and he decided to join the band. He then became Shelly's musical director after Tony left the group.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=17}} In 1988, P<U+00E9>rez co-written three songs for Shelly's debut album,{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=21}} and had a reception of playing a guitar extremely well.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=23}} Around this time, P<U+00E9>rez formed a rock band with two of his friends and would leave Shelly in the same year.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=24}}

== Career ==
=== 1989<U+2014>1995: Guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos and legal troubles ===
In 1989, Roger Garcia, who played led guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos, married and decided to leave the music business.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=23}} The bassist of the group, [[A.B. Quintanilla III]] received a positive reception about P<U+00E9>rez from other Tejano groups. He, and other members of the band, decided to check him out while he was rehearsing with Shelly to validate the rumors about him.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=23}} A.B. invited P<U+00E9>rez to one of Selena's concert and asked him if he would be interested in playing with Selena y Los Dinos. P<U+00E9>rez accepted and decided not to continue his project band with his friends and left Shelly's band in favor of playing with Selena y Los Dinos. His decision was based on the fact that Los Dinos's sound were "hip and sophisticated" than other Tejano bands and wanted to educate himself around arranging music, similar to A.B.'s job, which he admired.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=24}}

P<U+00E9>rez auditioned for the manager and A.B.'s father, [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], who initially did not want P<U+00E9>rez to take the part because of his rocker image. A.B., insisted that he will change his look to be suitable for their band. Abraham feared that allowing P<U+00E9>rez in the group could dissolve his "perfect image" daughter, [[Selena]], and ruin her career in the music scene. He then accepted P<U+00E9>rez in the group after A.B. tried convincing him to allow him to play in the group.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=9}} A.B encouraged P<U+00E9>rez to dip into different music genres and fused their basic sound to develop his own style.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=60}} He and A.B developed a strong friendship and would time-to-time have P<U+00E9>rez play his guitar to help A.B. write some of Selena's songs for her next recording.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=61}} P<U+00E9>rez barely knew Spanish, lead keyboardist of the group, [[Ricky Vela]], occasionally tutored him.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=121}}

In 1991, P<U+00E9>rez was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] and [[Speed limits in the United States#80 and 85 mph limits|exceeded the speed limit]] in San Antonio, Texas. One of the police officers threw his cousin, who was in the back seat of his car, on the ground. This caused P<U+00E9>rez to act out and went ballistic on one of the police officers.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=56}}  His cousin and friend, who also accompanied P<U+00E9>rez, engaged in an altercation between the two police officers. After the brawl, the police officers hand cuffed P<U+00E9>rez and his cousin and decided to let P<U+00E9>rez's friend go, telling him to "run, don't walk" and advised him to "not even turn around". When they booked P<U+00E9>rez, they confirmed that they initiated a [[high-speed chase]] and that they were following P<U+00E9>rez's car the entire duration of his driving. P<U+00E9>rez reported that the officers were lying but decided not to pursue further actions because it would be "[his] word against theirs."{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=57}} P<U+00E9>rez was not charged and was released the same night, he later told Selena and Abraham about his run with the police, both appreciated him for going to them and talking about it.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=58}}

Several months after his first arrest, P<U+00E9>rez shared a hotel room with two road crews of Selena y Los Dinos. The two brothers, who were intoxicated, began wrestling and P<U+00E9>rez, who was also drunk, joined them. One of the brothers were thrown so hard that he knocked out the door to their hotel room. There were also holes found throughout the walls of the room. After this, P<U+00E9>rez decided to sleep at his house and not at the hotel.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=61}} The next morning, the two brothers were instantly fired from the band. Abraham decided to give P<U+00E9>rez another chance and accepted his apology.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=63}} Abraham opened his own recording studio, [[Q-Productions]], in late 1993. He began managing a rock band and approached P<U+00E9>rez if he would be interested in writing songs for them.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=216}} The lead vocalist for that group, Nando "Guerro" Dominguez, went by P<U+00E9>rez and Selena's house to begin recording. After several hours, P<U+00E9>rez ended the recording session with Selena asking to record it.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=217}} After she did, the recording remained unreleased<U+2014>and in 2004<U+2014>was released in her posthumous compilation album called ''[[Momentos Intimos]]'' under the name "[[Puede Ser]]". A.B. wrote "Ya No", the last recording for Selena's studio album, ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994). He insisted that he would like to turn it into a rock song and asked for P<U+00E9>rez's assistance.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=232}}

==== P<U+00E9>rez and Selena's relationship ====
In 1989, P<U+00E9>rez and A.B. wrote Selena's [[Coca-Cola]] endorsement [[jingle]], and after the company accepted the lyrics and filmed Selena for the commercial, A.B. treated the band to a vacation in [[Acapulco]], Mexico.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=9}} While there, P<U+00E9>rez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend back in San Antonio.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=12}} After their trip, P<U+00E9>rez decided that it would be best for him and Selena if he tried to distance himself from her, but found it hard to do and decided to try building a relationship with her.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=28}} The two declared their feelings for each other at a [[Pizza Hut]] restaurant and shortly afterwards became a couple.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=49}} They discreetly hid their relationship from everyone, fearing that Abraham will act out negatively towards their relationship.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=52}} This caused added stress on Selena who did not enjoy hiding her feelings for P<U+00E9>rez from anybody.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=58}}

Selena's sister, [[Suzette Quintanilla]], and drummer of the band found P<U+00E9>rez and Selena filtering with each other.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=72}} She immediately told Abraham who escorted P<U+00E9>rez off the bus to explain to him that his and Selena's relationship is over.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=73}} The two continue on their relationship despite Abraham's disapproval.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=75}} One day while everyone was on the tour bus, Abraham stopped the bus and ran to the back where P<U+00E9>rez and Selena were sitting. He began yelling telling them that their relationship is once again over, this caused Selena to scream back with P<U+00E9>rez trying to calm them both down. After Abraham began insulting P<U+00E9>rez calling him a "cancer in my family", he stood up and supported Selena as the two continue arguing. Abraham then exclaimed that he will disband the group if they continue on their relationship. Selena and P<U+00E9>rez relented and Abraham went as far as firing him from the band as he held Selena from running away with him.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=79}}

After Abraham fired P<U+00E9>rez from the band, he moved back into his father's apartment and began playing music wherever he could. P<U+00E9>rez wrote in his book that he felt "free of that nerve-racking situation with her father and the other members of Los Dinos, I started enjoying my life again." He also noted that Selena was still suffering from their departure and the two tried to keep in contact while she was touring.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=81}} On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena began pounding on P<U+00E9>rez's hotel room where he was staying at. Selena forced her way in and began to cry telling him that she cannot continue on without being with him. She exclaimed to him that she wants to get married that day while P<U+00E9>rez insisted that it was not the right thing to do at the moment. Selena then told P<U+00E9>rez that her father will never accept their relationship and would not show up to their planned wedding.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=91}} P<U+00E9>rez agreed and the two eloped in [[Nueces County, Texas]].{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=93}} 

Selena believed that her father would leave them alone if they got married and they wouldn't have to hide from anyone.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=92}} Within hours of their marriage, the media publicity announced what Selena and P<U+00E9>rez had done, despite the two not wanting to tell anyone that early.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=99}} Selena's family were trying to track her down after coming to find out about them eloping. Abraham did not take the news well and alienated himself for awhile.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=99}} Selena and P<U+00E9>rez moved in together in her house. Abraham approached P<U+00E9>rez, apologized, and accepted the relationship. P<U+00E9>rez was granted back his position in the band by Abraham.{{sfn|P<U+00E9>rez|2012|p=105}}

{{main|Murder of Selena}}
In early 1995, Abraham found out [[Yolanda Saldivar]], who managed Selena's [[Selena Etc.|boutiques]] and fan club, was embezzling money from these establishments. They held a meeting in early March of that year, with Saldivar not understanding the discrepancies of checks they found.

In the early 2010s, P<U+00E9>rez formed a new group called the Chris P<U+00E9>rez Project with Puerto Rican singer Angel Ferrer. The two released "Todo es Diferente" to promote themselves.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hector Salda<U+00F1>a: Chris Perez: Todo es diferente |first=Hector |last=Salda<U+00F1>a |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/entertainment_columnists/hector_saldana/article/Hector-Salda-a-Chris-Perez-Todo-es-diferente-2247376.php |newspaper=San Antonio-Express News |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref>

In March 2012, P<U+00E9>rez wrote ''To Selena, With Love'' which discussed his and Selena's relationship together and the struggles they had to overcome. Perez initially did not want to write the book and said in an interview with [[Univision]], "The book never would have happened. I was that guy who always said I was never going to do that because I was very protective of my memories. I didn<U+2019>t want to go back and relive a lot of the things, because I had suppressed them for so long so that I could move forward. I felt like if I hadn<U+2019>t done that, I don<U+2019>t know if I could have moved forward with my life. It wasn't necessarily that I was waiting for a certain time to do it [writing the book] because I always said that I was never going to do it. But with the Internet nowadays, I have a direct line [of communication] to a lot of her [Selena's] fans and my fans. I read thousands upon thousands of comments and questions asking, <U+2018>Would you ever think about doing it [write a book about Selena]? How was she? What was your life together like?<U+2019> Reading all that stuff made an impact on me and it got me thinking, maybe I should. There were some other things that happened in my life that I took as signs, which I mention in the book." P<U+00E9>rez had the help from other publications that were published after Selena's death to help him remember specific details of their lives together.<ref name="univison"/> The book received acclaim and was supported by fans.<ref name="huff"/><ref name="houston"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Selena, la flor perenne |author=Martinez, Brenda |url=http://www.prensalibre.com/espectaculos/selena-FLOR-PERENNE_0_684531619.html |newspaper=[[Prensa Libre]] |date=April 18, 2012 |accessdate=May 3, 2013|language=Spanish}}</ref>
