[[Image:Logo_hillsong_new.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hillsong Church logo.]]'''Hillsong Church''' (formerly '''Hills Christian Life Centre''') is a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Christianity|Christian]] church, affiliated with the [[Assemblies of God in Australia|Assemblies of God]]. Its primary location is in [[Australia]] where it is headquartered at its "Hills" campus near [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], to the north-west of [[Sydney]] in [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills']] Norwest Business Park. It also has a congregation designated the "City" campus which is located in [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]], near Sydney's [[central business district]]. 

Hillsong's international off-shoots include [[Hillsong London]], in the [[United Kingdom]], Hillsong Paris in [[France]] and Hillsong Kiev in [[Ukraine]]. Since March 2007 in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] three times once a month "Hillsong Nights"  and a "Connect Group" will take place arranged by Hillsong Kiev, and Hillsong Berlin [[Germany]] will be prepared through a "Connect Group".

== History ==
Brian and Bobbie Houston moved from [[New Zealand]] in 1978 and joined the [[Sydney Christian Life Centre]] at [[Darlinghurst]], pastored by [[Frank Houston]], Brian's father.  They started Hillsong Church, which was then known as "Hills Christian Life Centre", in August 1983 with an initial congregation of 45.  Within four years it had grown to 900 people. In 1990, the church moved from "the warehouse" to hold services at the Hills Entertainment Centre.

Soon enough an annual conference was developed and called [[Hillsong Conference]], which was created to teach and train Christians from all over the world and Australia-wide. Up to 18,000 believers gather together to celebrate unity and passion for God, the church and his people. Still today, Hillsong Conference exists to champion the cause of the local church. {{Fact|date=May 2007}}<!-- User:Amanda Mulcahy---as stated on Hillsong Conference 2007 brochure.-->

In the early [[1990s]] praise and worship recordings from Hills Christian Life Centre were released in Australia and internationally under the name "Hillsong".  This raised the profile of the church. This name is also used for a television show featuring clips from the videos of the recordings and a message from Brian Houston. In 1997, the church moved into its new building at [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales|Baulkham Hills']] Norwest Business Park. 

In the late 1990s the church realised that the name "Hillsong" was more well-known than "Hills Christian Life Centre" due to the branding of its recordings.  The church was renamed "Hillsong Church" in 1999, about the time its mother church, Sydney CLC, was merged into Hillsong Church. <ref>{{cite news |title=Interview with HILLSONG Founder Brian Houston |author=Andrew Clark |date=2004-08-11 |accessdate=2006-06-30 |work=Christian Today |publisher=Christian Today Limited |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/news/church/interview.with.hillsong.founder.brian.houston/159.htm }}</ref> This followed the exposure of Frank Houston's sexual abuse of a boy in New Zealand some thirty years before, which led to his resignation. <ref>{{cite news |title=Hillsong farewells a lost sheep pioneer |author=Stephen Gibbs |date=[[2004-11-13]] |accessdate=2006-06-21 |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[John Fairfax Holdings]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Hillsong-farewells-a-lost-sheep-pioneer/2004/11/12/1100227581958.html }}</ref> <!-- may be better reference in SMH 27/03/2002, but can't find it online-->

After further consistant growth, a new 3500-seat convention centre at the church's "Hills" campus was opened on [[October 19]], [[2002]], by [[John Howard]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. The church recently announced its intentions to develop a significant area of land on Rothschild Avenue, [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]] into the new "City" campus. Today Hillsong Church is attended by over 20,000 people. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Story So Far |publisher=Hillsong Church |work=Hillsong Church website |url=http://www2.hillsong.com/church/default.asp?pid=10 |accessdate=2007-06-08 }}</ref>

== Ministries ==

Hillsong Church has many ministries operating that support the vision and the heartbeat of the church. Hillsong Church, like other churches, conducts baptisms, weddings, funerals and courses for new Christians. In order to connect people into church life, there are welcome lounges at the two main campuses and welcome to church parties are held. Pastoral care is available through the Pastors, who offer prayer, support, home visits and emergency home care. Healing servies are held monthly, where people who need healing in mind, body and soul can be prayed for. The main ministries of Hillsong Church are;

The college offers training in worship and creative arts, pastoral leadership, TV and media, youth ministry, children's ministry and pastoral counselling.  Since January 2006, HILC in association with [[Southern Cross College]] has offered a Bachelor of Theology degree program.

== Political influence ==
The Hillsong Church has attracted support from high profile politicians, especially from the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. The Prime Minister, John Howard, opened its Baulkham Hills campus and the Federal Treasurer, [[Peter Costello]], spoke at its annual conferences in July 2004 and 2005.  [[Mark Latham]], the former  [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]],  declined Hillsong's invitation to the 2004 conference,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/18/1097951626689.html?from=storylhs&oneclick=true |accessdate=2006-06-27 |date=[[2004-10-19]] |title=Mock Christians at your peril, lefties |author=Gerard Henderson |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[John Fairfax Holdings]]}}</ref> although [[Bob Carr]], the then [[Premier of New South Wales]], (from the [[Australian Labor Party]]), did attend the 2005 conference.

The former New South Wales Liberal Party state director, Scott Morrison (to November 2004), is a prominent member of Hillsong Church. 

The church also attracts a large number of aspirational voters from seats in the west of Sydney such as [[Division of Mitchell|Mitchell]] (where the church is located), [[Division of Lindsay|Lindsay]], [[Division of Macquarie|Macquarie]] and [[Division of Greenway|Greenway]].  [[Louise Markus]] who ran the Hillsong Emerge Ltd, the church's drug and alcohol outreach service in [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]], was preselected as the Liberal Party candidate for Greenway in the [[Australian legislative election, 2004|2004 federal election]] and was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Labor had held the seat since it was proclaimed in [[1984]] until she beat the ALP candidate [[Ed Husic]], as well as twelve other candidates, with a two party preferred swing of 3.7%.

Since the election, accusations have been made in the [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW State Parliament]] that Mrs Markus's campaign had exploited the [[Muslim]] background of her chief opponent,<ref>the Hon. Eric Roozendaal, [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/Hansart.nsf/ac93aa6a5ab889d3ca2571ca000080c7/f41fb4682416f8a1ca256f460009f784!OpenDocument Extract from Transcript of Hansard: Religious Freedom (Article No.43)], page 12087, NSW Legislative Council Hansard, 27th October 2004</ref><ref>The Hon.

Liberal MP for Mitchell, [[Alan Cadman]], and two [[Family First Party]] Senate candidates, Joan Woods and Ivan Herald, who failed to win Senate seats, were featured in a Hillsong circular during the election, with members being asked to pray for them.

Publicly, however, the church has distanced itself from advocating certain political groups and parties, including the fledgling Family First party:
:''One thing we are not is a political movement... The Assemblies of God in Australia does not have a political vision and we don't have a political agenda. I think people need to understand the difference between the church being very involved in politics and individual Christians being involved in politics. There is a big difference.''

''See main articles: [[Hillsong Music]], [[Hillsong musicians]], [[List of Hillsong albums]] and [[List of Hillsong songs]].''

Hillsong's music has become internationally well-known amongst Christian groups. Songs such as "Power of Your Love" by [[Geoff Bullock]] and "Shout to the Lord" by [[Darlene Zschech]] have become popular and are sung in churches worldwide. Hillsong have released over 40 albums since 1992, many of them achieving gold status in Australia. [[Hillsong United]] has also been present to Hillsong's music. The group led by [[Marty Sampson]] and [[Joel Houston]] has been active since 1999. Their 2004 live praise and worship album, ''[[For All You've Done]]'', reached #1 in the mainstream Australian album charts ([[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]) when many copies were sold during Hillsong's [[Hillsong Conference|annual conference]].<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] |date=[[2004-08-03]] |accessdate=2006-06-21 |title=Australian Recording Artists Make ARIA Chart History |url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/AustralianRecordingArtistsMakeARIAChartHistory.htm }}</ref>

==Controversies==
Some journalists and religious leaders have expressed concerns about the church's political stance and use of donated funds for its ministries.<ref name="chequebook">{{cite news |accessdate=2006-06-27 |date=[[2005-02-18]] |title=Praise the Lord and pass the chequebook |author=Greg Bearup |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Praise-the-Lord-and-pass-the-chequebook/2005/02/18/1108609391134.html }}</ref> The church's prosperity teachings have also been criticised by prominent Baptist minister [[Tim Costello]]<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2006-12-24|date=[[2004-07-09]]|title=Evangelist Christian vote wanted|author=Stephen McDonell|work=Lateline|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1150747.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal [[George Pell]]<ref name="truebelievers">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/06/1099547435083.html |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Hillsong's true believers |date=[[2004-11-07]] |accessdate=2006-08-10 |publisher=[[John Fairfax Holdings]]}}</ref>.

As Hillsong is a [[Pentecostal]] church, it has also come under some fire from [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] leaders; most notably from the conservative [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]], regarding its prosperity teachings<ref>[[The Briefing]], issue 338, [[Matthias Media]], November 2006</ref> as well as other aspects of [[Pentecostal]] theology such as [[faith healing]] and [[baptism in the Holy Spirit]]. A critical article about Hillsong came from The January 2007 issue of ''[[The Briefing]]'' (published by [[Matthias Media]], an evangelical publication) contained a lengthy article which criticised Hillsong on several fronts, claiming that "core aspects of evangelical theology" such as "the cross, the blood, the judgment of God... the systematic exposition of the Scriptures" were "virtually absent" from Hillsong's teaching.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Payne, Tony | coauthors = Cheng, Gordon | title =The surprising face of Hillsong | journal =[[The Briefing]] | issue =340 | publisher =[[Matthias Media]] | date =January 2007}}</ref> ''The Briefing'' went so far as to suggest that conservative evangelicals should consider placing "a blanket ban on Hillsong music in [their] churches" so as not to endorse or financially support Hillsong.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Carmichael | first = Ian | title =Should we sing Hillsong songs? | journal =[[The Briefing]] | issue =340 | publisher =[[Matthias Media]] | date =January 2007}}</ref>

In 2006 Hillsong's plans to build a 3000-seat auditorium and a 900-space car park ran into community opposition with more than 300 signatures collected in a few days.  The site was a former [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] depot and had been rezoned to allow 66 townhouses, but Hillsong Church bought it for $28 million and propose to build a new auditorium in [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]] to replace their [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]] site.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/3000seat-hillsong-bid-fires-chorus-of-discord/2006/10/14/1160246373307.html |title=3000-seat Hillsong bid fires chorus of discord |author=Alex Mitchell |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=[[2006-10-15]] |accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref>
