==History of Atlanta==
{{Main|History of Atlanta|Atlanta in the Civil War}}

Prior to the arrival of European Americans in north Georgia, [[Creek (people)|Creek]] and [[Cherokee Indian]]s inhabited the area.<ref>http://chieftainstrail.com/</ref> A Creek village located where [[Peachtree Creek]] flows into the Chattahoochee River, [[Standing Peachtree]] or Standing Pitch Tree, was the closest Indian settlement to what is now Atlanta.<ref>http://www.atlanta.net/visitors/folklore.html</ref>  As part of the systematic removal of Native Americans from northern Georgia from 1802 to 1825,<ref>http://ngeorgia.com/history/indianla.html</ref> the Creek ceded the area that is now Metro Atlanta in 1821.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/CitiesCounties/Counties&id=h-2335 New Georgia Encyclopedia, "Fulton County"]</ref> White settlers arrived in 1822, and nearby [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]] was founded the following year.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1403 New Georgia Encyclopedia, "DeKalb County"]</ref>

In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref name=W&ARR>{{cite web | title = Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad | work = About North Georgia | publisher = Golden Ink | url = http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html | accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref> The initial route was to run from Chattanooga to a spot called simply "Terminus," located east of the Chattahoochee River, which would eventually be linked to the [[Georgia Railroad]] from Augusta and the [[Macon and Western Railroad]], which ran from Macon to Savannah. An engineer was chosen to recommend the location of the terminus. Once he surveyed various possible routes, he drove a stake (the <U+201C>[[zero milepost]]<U+201D>) into the ground in what is now [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]]. A year later, the area around the railroad terminus had developed into a settlement, first known as "Terminus" and then Thrasherville, for [[John Thrasher]], a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the settlement.<ref>[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm Thrasherville State Historical Marker], retrieved on 2009-11-13.</ref> By 1842, the settlement had six buildings and 30 residents and the town was renamed "Marthasville".<ref name=shorthistory>{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1782<U+2013>1859 | publisher = CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date = 2007-09-22 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history1.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> The Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, [[J.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a hub for the distribution of military supplies. In 1864, following the capture of Chattanooga, the [[Union Army]] moved southward and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region now covered by Metropolitan Atlanta was the location of several major army [[battle]]s, including [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], [[Battle of Peachtree Creek|Peachtree Creek]], [[Battle of Jonesborough|Jonesborough]] (now [[Jonesboro, GA|Jonesboro]]), and the [[Battle of Atlanta]]. On September 1, 1864, following a four-month-long siege of the city by the [[Union Army]] under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] made the decision to retreat from Atlanta. General Hood ordered that all public buildings and possible assets to the Union Army be destroyed. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, General Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, in preparation of the Union Army's [[Sherman's March to the Sea|march to Savannah]], Sherman ordered for Atlanta to be burned to the ground, sparing only the city's churches and hospitals.<ref name=shorthistory2>{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1860<U+2013>1864 | publisher = CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date=  2007-09-22 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history2.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. From 1867 until 1888, [[U.S. Army]] soldiers occupied the [[Fort McPherson|McPherson Barracks]] in southern Atlanta to ensure that the [[reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] reforms were carried out.

In 1868, the [[Georgia state capital|Georgia State Capital]] was moved from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] to Atlanta due to the city's superior [[rail transportation]] network, making Atlanta the fifth location of the capital of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|State of Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Edwin L. | title = The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities | publisher = Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia | url = http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 | accessdate = 2007-11-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> The Confederate [[Old soldiers' home|Soldiers' Home]] was built to house disabled and elderly Georgia veterans from 1901 to 1941.<ref>R. B. Rosenburg, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27683131 Living Monuments: Confederate Soldier's Homes in the New South]'' (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1993), 215 and 218, says that the Georgia Dept. of Archives and History, Atlanta, has applications for admission, Board of Trustees letters received, minutes, and reports, hospital record book, invoices, list of persons subscribing contributions, payrolls, record of miscellaneous functions, record of admissions, discharges and deaths, record of donations, register of inmates, George N. Saussey Diary, and visitors register, and the Atlanta Historical Society, Atlanta, has a Confederate veterans file.</ref> [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' [[newspaper]], promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "New South", one to be built on a modern economy, less reliant on [[agriculture]]. As a focal point of this change, the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (its future name) was established in Atlanta in 1885 (with its first classes held in October 1888).

Increased racial tensions, the result of a media-fueled hysteria over alleged sexual assaults on white women by black men, led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1906atlantaraceriot.org/|title=Atlanta Race Riot | publisher= The Coalition to Remember the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot |accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> and over 70 injured.
[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]
On May 21, 1917, the [[Great Atlanta Fire of 1917|Great Atlanta Fire]] destroyed 1,938 buildings, mostly wooden, in what is now the [[Old Fourth Ward]]. The fire resulted in 10,000 people becoming homeless. Only one person died, a woman who died of a heart attack at seeing her home in ashes.

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the [[film premiere]] of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's [[Margaret Mitchell]]. Several stars of the film, including  [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Olivia de Havilland]],  and its legendary [[film producer|producer]], [[David O. Selznick]], attended the gala event, which was held at Loew's Grand Theatre, now demolished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind |title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone With The Wind |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> The reception was held at the [[Georgian Terrace Hotel]], which still exists.

During [[World War II]], manufacturing industries such as the [[Bell Aircraft Company]]'s large factory in the northwestern suburb of Marietta, a massive growth in railroad traffic<U+2014>and the manufacture of [[railroad car]]s<U+2014>for the war effort, and great growth at [[Ft. McClellan]], [[Fort Gillem]] (est. 1941), and [[Dobbins Air Force Base|Rickenbacker Field]] forced a large growth in the population and economy of Atlanta. Shortly after the war, the federal [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was founded in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web | title = Commemorating CDC's 60th Anniversary | work = CDC Website | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | url = http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/60th.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>

In the 1950s, the city's newly-constructed freeway system enabled middle class Atlantans to relocate to from the city to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population, decreasing from 31% in 1960 to 9% in 2000.<ref>http://www.demographia.com/db-atl1960.htm</ref>  

During the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], with Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and students from Atlanta's historically Black colleges and [[university|universities]] playing major roles in the movement's leadership. In 1961, Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]] became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city's public schools.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Hornsby| first = Alton| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Black Public Education in Atlanta, Georgia, 1954<U+2013>1973: From Segregation to Segregation| journal = The Journal of Negro History| volume = 76| issue = 1| pages = 21<U+2013>47| publisher = Association for the Study of African-American Life and History, Inc.| date = Winter<U+2013>Autumn, 1991| id = ISSN 00222992}}</ref> While minimal compared to other cities, Atlanta was not completely free of racial strife. After forced-housing patterns were outlawed, violence, intimidation and organized political pressure was used in some white neighborhoods to discourage blacks from buying homes there. However, such efforts proved futile as real estate agents began engaging in [[blockbusting]], encouraging white homeowners to sell at rock-bottom prices so that the agents could re-sell the homes to blacks at a large profit. The resulting [[white flight]] mostly affected Atlanta's western and southern neighborhoods, many of them transitioning to majority black by the 1970s.<ref name=kruse>[http://books.google.com/books?id=c5763Zgu4_oC&lpg=PP1 White flight: Atlanta and the making of modern conservatism By Kevin Michael Kruse]</ref> In 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in [[Cascade Heights]], countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the "city too busy to hate."<ref name=kruse/><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874660,00.html "The South: Divided City", Time magazine, 1961-01-18]</ref>

African Americans became a majority in the city by 1970, and exercised new-found political influence by electing Atlanta's first black mayor, [[Maynard Jackson]], in 1973. However, suburbanization, rising prices, a booming economy, and new migrants have decreased the black percentage of the city from a high of 69% in 1980 to 54% in 2010.<ref>U.S. Census Bureau</ref> From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, while it lost 28,795 black residents.<ref name="nyt-031106">{{cite news | publisher=The New York Times | first=Shaila | last=Dewan | date=March 11, 2006 | title=Gentrification Changing Face of New Atlanta | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/national/11atlanta.html?ei=5090&en=bf1cb813a14f4341&ex=1299733200&adxnnl=0&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1142054955-6bzVsYXnlCDNwbMJEoswIg&pagewanted=all}}</ref>

In 1990, Atlanta was selected as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]]. Following the [[Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics|announcement]], Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation. Atlanta became the third American city to host the [[Summer Olympics]]. The games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies, as well as the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]].<ref>{{cite web

During the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Atlanta completed its transformation into a cosmopolitan city, becoming well known for its robust cultural offerings. Much of the city's change in the last decade was been driven by young, college-educated professionals who have moved into Atlanta by the thousands, seeking a lifestyle rich in cultural variety, diversity, and excitement. From 2000 to 2009, the [[Intown Atlanta|tree-mile radius]] surrounding [[Downtown Atlanta]] gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61% and the sixth-largest such increase in the nation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-01-1Ayoungrestless01_ST_N.htm?sms_ss=twitter&at_xt=4d959a9cc8ce3e5c,0 | work=USA Today | title=Urban centers draw more young, educated adults | date=2011-04-01}}</ref> In fact, Atlanta is on the leading edge of a national trend: while the same growth has occurred in dozens of other American cities, the change was twice as strong in Atlanta as it was nationwide.<ref>http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/young-professionals-lead-surge-907440.html</ref> As the city's new residents transformed communities long in decline into neighborhoods of choice, Atlanta's cultural offerings expanded to meet their increased demand. A total of 45 restaurants have opened Downtown since 2008. The [[High Museum of Art]] doubled in size and launched partnerships with major institutions such as [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre|the Louvre]] and [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 2007, the [[Alliance Theatre]] won a [[Tony Award]], placing it among the nation's [[Regional Theatre Tony Award|leading performing arts venues]]. The once-industrial [[West Midtown|Westside]] is now home to warehouse lofts, start-up companies, and buzzed-about restaurants.<ref name="online.wsj.com">{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704415104576250962970106874.html?mod=WSJ_hp_MIDDLETopMiniLeadStory | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Timothy W. | last=Martin | title=The New New South | date=2011-04-16}}</ref>

===Topography===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|132.4|sqmi|1}}. {{convert|131.7|sqmi|1}} of it is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|1}} of it is water. The total area is 0.54% water. At about {{convert|1050|ft|m|0}} above mean sea level the airport is at {{convert|1010|ft|m|0}}, Atlanta sits atop a [[ridge]] south of the [[Chattahoochee River]].

The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] line enters Atlanta from the south, proceeding to the downtown area. From downtown, the divide line runs eastward along DeKalb Avenue and the [[CSX]] rail lines through Decatur.<ref name=divide>{{cite web | last = Yeazel | first = Jack | title = Eastern Continental Divide in Georgia | date= 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.gpsinformation.org/jack/Divide/Divide.html | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref> Rainwater that falls on the south and east side runs eventually into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide runs into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]<ref name=divide/> via the [[Chattahoochee River]]. That river is part of the [[ACF River Basin]], and from which Atlanta and many of its neighbors draw most of their water. Being at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is still preserved, in part by the [[Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area]]. Downstream however, excessive water use during droughts and pollution during floods has been a source of contention and legal battles with neighboring states [[Alabama]] and [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Florida, Alabama, Georgia water sharing | publisher = WaterWebster | date = | url = http://www.waterwebster.com/FloridaAlabamaGeorgia.htm | format = news archive | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet&nbsp;<U+2013> Interstate Water Conflicts: Georgia&nbsp;<U+2014> Alabama&nbsp;<U+2014> Florida | publisher = Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce | date = | url = http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/initiatives/img/tri-statefactsheet.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061031192854/http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/initiatives/img/tri-statefactsheet.pdf |archivedate = October 31, 2006}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:AtlantaSnow.jpg|thumb|Atlanta's [[Piedmont Park]], with a blanket of winter snow.]] Atlanta has a [[humid subtropical climate]], <!--Please see discussion about Koppen system-->(Cfa) according to the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen classification]], with hot, humid summers and mild winters that are occasionally cold by the standards of the southern United States.

===Tree canopy===
[[File:ATL HQ.JPG|thumb|[[Atlanta Plaza]] skyscraper surrounded by trees, a common sight in the city]]
Atlanta has a reputation as a "city in a forest" or a "city of trees" due to its abundance of trees, unique among major cities.<ref name="publicbroadcasting.net">http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wabe/news.newsmain/article/0/6/1619579/Science/Atlanta%27s.tree.canopy.at.risk</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/atlanta/0002010001.html|title=Introduction to Atlanta | publisher= Wiley Publishing, Inc. | work= Frommer's |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.atlantamagazine.com/article.php?id=207 |title= City Observed: Power Plants |accessdate=2007-09-28 |last= Warhop |first= Bill |work= Atlanta |publisher= Atlanta Magazine |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070607192757/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/article.php?id=207 |archivedate= 2007-06-07}}</ref><ref name="10best.com">http://www.10best.com/destinations/georgia/atlanta/</ref> The city's [[Peachtree Street|main street]] is named after a [[Peach|tree]], and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. The nickname is factually accurate, as the city's tree coverage percentage is at 36%, the highest out of all major American cities, and above the national average of 27%.<ref>http://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/tree-cover-how-does-your-city-measure-up</ref> Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed<U+2014>it was the main reason cited by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in naming Atlanta a "Place of a Lifetime":<ref>http://blogs.ajc.com/inside-access/2009/09/17/atlanta-a-national-geographic-traveler-place-of-a-lifetime/</ref><blockquote>"For a sprawling city with the nation<U+2019>s ninth-largest metro area, Atlanta is surprisingly lush with trees<U+2014>[[magnolia]]s, [[Cornus (genus)|dogwoods]], [[Pine|Southern pines]], and magnificent [[oak]]s."<ref>http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/city-guides/atlanta-georgia/</ref></blockquote>

The city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found that Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996. This loss of tree canopy resulted in a 33% increase in stormwater runoff and a loss of 11 million pounds of pollutants removed annually, a value of approximately $28 million per year.<ref>http://www.treenextdoor.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148&Itemid=179</ref> Due to a historic [[drought]] in the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Atlanta lost trees at an unprecedented rate. For example, [[Piedmont Park]] lost about a dozen large, historic trees in 2009, compared to two or three during normal years. Although many of Atlanta's trees are between 80&ndash;100 years old and thus reaching the end of their normal lifespan, the drought accelerated their demise by shrinking the trees' roots. Fortunately, the problem is being addressed by community organizations and city government.<ref name="publicbroadcasting.net"/> [[Trees Atlanta]], a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 75,000 shade trees.<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = Trees Atlanta | url = http://www.treesatlanta.org/aboutus.html | accessdate = 2007-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070922033545/http://www.treesatlanta.org/aboutus.html |archivedate = September 20, 2010}}</ref> Atlanta's city government awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees.<ref name="publicbroadcasting.net"/>

Being a city of trees encourages outdoor activity, and thanks to a perpetually mild climate, nature is a constant guest in Atlanta. The city is home to the [[Atlanta Dogwood Festival]], an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native [[Cornus (genus)|dogwoods]] are in bloom. Downtown's [[Centennial Olympic Park]] is the start and finish of the [[Georgia Marathon]], which courses through central Atlanta and Decatur suburbs, business sections and major schools of higher learning like [[Georgia State University]], [[Agnes Scott College]], [[Emory University]] and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]].

===Parks, gardens, and trails===
Ever-popular [[Piedmont Park]] and the quieter [[Grant Park (Atlanta)|Grant Park]] call to athletes and loungers throughout the week.<ref name="10best.com"/> The [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]] is home to the [[Atlanta Botanical Garden#Canopy Walk|Canopy Walk]], a 600-foot elevated walkway ambling 40 feet from the ground through a 15-acre forest of mature hardwoods, and the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the United States. 

The [[BeltLine]] is a former rail corridor that forms a 22-mile loop around Atlanta's central neighborhoods and has been acquired as public space. Most of the corridor is already open as a rough walking path, and it is to be developed into trails with the eventual addition of transit. A trail is already built near the [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]] neighborhood and one is underway from [[Piedmont Park]] near Midtown, south to [[Inman Park]]. [[BeltLine]] projects will increase Atlanta's park space by 40%,<ref>[http://www.beltline.org/Implementation/ParksandGreenspace/tabid/1736/Default.aspx Atlanta BeltLine]</ref> including two new parks: [[Historic Fourth Ward Park]], now open, and [[Westside Park]].

PATH maintains a network of biking and walking trails in Metro Atlanta including one that passes along the [[Carter Center]] and through [[Freedom Park]].

===Architecture===
[[File:1 Symphony Tower.jpg|thumb|Midtown boasts various modern and post-modern architectural styles]]
{{Main|Architecture of Atlanta}}
Atlanta's skyline is punctuated with highrise and midrise buildings of modern and postmodern vintage. Its tallest landmark<U+2014>the [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]]<U+2014>is the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|42nd-tallest building in the world]] at {{convert|1023|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001338.html|title=World's Tallest Buildings | publisher= Infoplease |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> It is also the tallest building in the United States outside of [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]] and the tallest building in any U.S. state capital.

Unlike many other Southern cities such as [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], and [[New Orleans]], Atlanta chose not to retain its historic Old South architectural characteristics. Instead, Atlanta viewed itself as the leading city of a progressive "New South" and opted for expressive modern structures.<ref>Craig (1995), p. 15</ref> Atlanta's skyline includes works by most major U.S. firms and some of the more prominent architects of the 20th century, including [[Michael Graves]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Renzo Piano]], Pickard Chilton, and locally based internationally known Mack Scogin and Merrill Elam Architects. 

Atlanta's most notable hometown architect may be [[John Portman]] whose creation of the atrium hotel beginning with the [[Hyatt Regency Atlanta]]<U+2014>one of the tallest buildings in Atlanta at the time of its completion in 1967<ref>[http://atlantaregency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp Hyatt Regency Atlanta].</ref><U+2014>made a significant mark on hospitality architecture. Through his work, Portman<U+2014>a graduate of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture|College of Architecture]]<U+2014>reshaped downtown Atlanta with his designs for the [[Atlanta Merchandise Mart]], [[Peachtree Center]], the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]], and [[SunTrust Plaza]].

===Neighborhoods===
{{Main|Neighborhoods of Atlanta}}
Atlanta fell victim to the urban flight that affected other major American cities in the 20th century, causing the decline of well-to-do [[Neighborhoods of Atlanta#East Side|east side]] neighborhoods such as [[Inman Park]] and [[Candler Park]], typified by their [[American Craftsman|craftsman]] bungalows and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian mansions]]. In the 1970s, after neighborhood opposition blocked two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through the east side, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]] wave. By the early 1990s, the neighborhoods had transformed into shining examples of [[new urbanism|renewal]], and are now considered [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], urban neighborhoods, appealing to young residents who wish to be in close proximity to entertainment, shopping and transportation options.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, [[gentrification]] expanded into other parts of Atlanta, spreading into the historic [[streetcar suburb]]'s east of Downtown and Midtown, such as the [[Old Fourth Ward]], [[Kirkwood (Atlanta)|Kirkwood]], [[Cabbagetown (Atlanta)|Cabbagetown]], and the neighborhoods along the [[BeltLine]]. Older homes were renovated, new houses were constructed, and once-forgotten leafy, urban villages were rehabilitated. On the western side of the city, condos, apartments, and retail space were built into former warehouses spaces, quickly transforming once-industrial [[West Midtown]] into a shining model of [[smart growth]]. While the infill growth has slowed somewhat during the [[Late-2000s recession]], it still continues at a steady pace, expanding into areas such as [[Capitol View]], [[Peoplestown]], and [[Adair Park]].
[[File:Album 23 186.jpg|thumb|upright|High-rise residential units under construction in Midtown]]
The city's highrises are clustered in the three business districts of Atlanta<U+2014>[[Downtown Atlanta|Downtown]], [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]], and [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] (there are also two major suburban business districts, [[Perimeter Center]] to the north and [[Cumberland, Georgia|Cumberland]] to the northwest).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bo/?id=101302|title=Districts and Zones of Atlanta | publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> Downtown contains the most office space in the metro area and is home to many government offices. Notable skyscrapers include the [[191 Peachtree Tower]], [[Westin Peachtree Plaza]], [[SunTrust Plaza]], [[Georgia-Pacific Tower]], and the buildings of [[Peachtree Center]]. 

[[Midtown Atlanta]], located north of Downtown, developed rapidly after the completion of [[One Atlantic Center]] in 1987. In addition to being a major employment center for the metro area, Midtown contains the offices of many of the region's law firms.<ref>{{cite news| last = Southerland| first = Randy| title = What do Atlanta's big law firms see in Midtown?| publisher = Atlanta Business Chronicle| date = 2004-11-19| url = http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2004/11/22/focus10.html

[[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]], the city's uptown district, is eight miles (13&nbsp;km) north of Downtown. Beginning as a wealthy suburban community with the construction of [[Lenox Square]] mall in the 1950s, the area has since developed into a major employment, commercial, and financial center. Immediately surrounding Buckhead's skyscrapers are wealthy neighborhoods of single-family homes. 

Southwestern Atlanta contains a number of suburbs popular with African-Americans, such as [[Collier Heights]], Cascade Heights and Peyton Forest.<ref>{{cite news| last = Guerrero| first = Lucio| title = Lake Forest No. 3 on list of best homes for rich| work = Chicago Sun-Times online edition| publisher = Chicago Sun-Times| date = 2001-03-13| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010313/ai_n13893847| accessdate = 2008-12-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Atlanta was in the midst of a construction and retail boom prior to the [[late-2000s recession]], with over 60 new highrise or midrise buildings either proposed or under construction in 2006.<ref name=A-T-L>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanplanet.org/UP.Dynamic/atlanta.php|title=Growth in the A-T-L | publisher=UrbanPlanet Institute LLC |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> As in many cities, new development slowed drastically with the beginning of the Recession.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Atlanta}}
[[File:10 The High.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Museum of Art]], a division of the [[Woodruff Arts Center]] in [[Midtown Atlanta]]]]
Atlanta, while very much in the South, has a culture that is no longer strictly [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]]. This is due to the fact that in addition to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., nearly three-quarters of a million [[Immigration to the United States|foreign-born people]] make Atlanta their home, accounting for 13 percent of the city's population and making Atlanta one of the most [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] cities in the nation.<ref>http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html</ref> A random Atlantan is more likely to have been born in [[Bangalore]], [[Seoul]], or [[Indianapolis]] than in Atlanta. Thus, although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta's cultural fabric, it's mostly the backdrop to one of the nation's leading international cities. This unique cultural combination reveals itself at the [[High Museum of Art]], the bohemian shops of [[Little Five Points]], and the multi-cultural dining choices found along [[Buford Highway]].<ref>http://www.frommers.com/destinations/atlanta/0002010001.html</ref>

Classical musicians have included renowned conductors [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] and the Atlanta Symphony's [[Robert Spano]].

The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] is an historic landmark and one of the highest grossing venues in the world. The city also has a large collection of highly successful music venues of various sizes that host top and emerging touring acts. Popular local venues include [[the Tabernacle]], the [[Variety Playhouse]], [[The Masquerade (nightclub)|The Masquerade]], The Star Community Bar and [[the EARL]].

The city contains a flourishing theater community. Major Theater groups include the Tony Award-winning Alliance Theater (part of the Woodruff Arts Center), the internationally-known [[Center for Puppetry Arts]], Theatrical Outfit, Seven Stages Theater, The Horizon Theater Company, improv group Dad's Garage, Actor's Express, and the [[Shakespeare Tavern]].

Atlanta is also a major hub for the marching arts. The city is home of [[Spirit Drum and Bugle Corps]], who competes in [[Drum Corps International]], and both [[Alliance Drum and Bugle Corps]] and the [http://Corpsvets.org CorpsVets Drum and Bugle Corps], both of which participate in the [[Drum Corps Associates]] circuit.

Atlanta is the home of recording studios/companies [[So So Def Recordings]], [[Grand Hustle Records]], [[BME Recordings]], [[Block Entertainment]], [[Konvict Muzik]], and [[1017 Brick Squad]].

The city of Atlanta is seeing a unique and drastic demographic increase in its white population, and at a pace that outstrips the rest of the nation. The proportion of whites in the city's population, according to [[Brookings Institution]], grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other U.S. city. By 2010, Atlanta's white population had increased by 22,763 people. The white percentage increased from 31% in 2000, to 35% in 2006, to 38% in 2010, more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000. During the same time, the city's black poulation decreased by 28,795 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010. The demographic changes are due to an influx of whites into gentrifying [[Intown Atlanta|intown]] neighborhoods, such as [[East Atlanta]] and the [[Old Fourth Ward]], coupled with a movement of blacks into adjacent suburbs, such as [[Clayton County]].<ref name="clatl.com">[http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/03/21/atlantas-census-numbers-reveal-dip-in-black-population-and-lots-of-people-who-mysteriously-vanished Thomas Wheatley, "Atlanta's census numbers reveal dip in black population <U+2014> and lots of people who mysteriously vanished", Creative Loafing, 2011-03-21]</ref><ref name="clatl.com"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Gurwitt |first=Rob |url=http://www.governing.com/articles/0807atlanta.htm |title=Governing Magazine: Atlanta and the Urban Future, July 2008 |publisher=Governing.com |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>

The public school system ([[Atlanta Public Schools]]) is run by the Atlanta Board of Education with superintendent Dr. Beverly L. Hall. As of 2007, the system has an active enrollment of 49,773 students, attending a total of 106 schools: including 58 elementary schools (three of which operate on a year-round calendar), 16 middle schools, 20 high schools, and 7 charter schools.<ref name="APS">{{cite web  | title = 2007<U+2013>2008 APS Fast Facts  | publisher = Atlanta Public Schools  | url = http://www.atlanta.k12.ga.us/content/aps/FastFacts07.pdf  | accessdate = 2007-09-28 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025055226/http://www.atlanta.k12.ga.us/content/aps/FastFacts07.pdf |archivedate = October 25, 2007}}</ref> The school system also supports two alternative schools for middle and/or high school students, two single-sex academies, and an adult learning center.<ref name="APS"/> The school system also owns and operates radio station [[WABE-FM]] 90.1, a [[National Public Radio]] affiliate, and [[Public Broadcasting Service]] television station WPBA 30.

==Transportation==
===Air===
[[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] {{airport codes|ATL|KATL}}, the world's busiest airport as measured by [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|passenger traffic]] and by [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|aircraft traffic]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Tharpe|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/01/04/0104airport.html|title=Atlanta airport still the "busiest": Hartsfield-Jackson nips Chicago's O'hare for second year in a row|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2007-01-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070106042352/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/01/04/0104airport.html|archivedate=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref> provides air service between Atlanta and many national and international destinations.

The MARTA rail system has a station in the airport terminal, and provides direct service to Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Sandy Springs. The major [[general aviation]] airports near the city proper are [[DeKalb-Peachtree Airport]] {{airport codes|PDK|KPDK}} and [[Fulton County Airport (Georgia)|Brown Field]] {{airport codes|FTY|KFTY}}. See [[List of airports in the Atlanta area]] for a more complete listing.

===Highway===
With a comprehensive network of freeways that radiate out from the city, Atlantans rely on their cars as the dominant mode of transportation in the region<ref>{{cite web  | title = Atlanta: Smart Travel Tips  | work = Fodor's  | publisher = Fodor's Travel  | url = http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=atlanta@15&cur_section=tra&pg=2  | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Atlanta is mostly encircled by [[Interstate 285]], a [[beltway]] locally known as "the Perimeter" which has come to mark the boundary between the interior of the region and its surrounding [[suburb]]s.

Three major [[interstate highways]] converge in Atlanta; [[Interstate 20|I-20]] runs east to west across town, while I-75 runs from northwest to southeast, and I-85 runs from northeast to southwest.  The latter two combine to form the [[Downtown Connector]] (I-75/85) through the middle of the city.  The combined highway carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day.  The Connector is one of the ten most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/02/06/cx_bm_0207trafficslide_6.html?thisSpeed=6000| work=Worst City Choke Points | title= Atlanta, I-75 at I-85 | publisher=Forbes.com| accessdate=2006-04-02}}</ref> The intersection of I-85 and I-285 in [[Doraville, Georgia|Doraville]]<U+2014>officially called the [[Tom Moreland Interchange]], is known to most residents as [[Spaghetti Junction]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/traffic/roadwords.html| work=AJC Online | title= Atlanta Road Lingo | publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution| accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref> Metropolitan Atlanta is approached by 13 freeways.  In addition to the aforementioned interstates, [[I-575]], [[Georgia 400]], [[Georgia 141]], [[Interstate 675 (Georgia)|I-675]], [[Georgia 316]], [[I-985]], Stone Mountain Freeway ([[US 78]]), and Langford Parkway (SR 166) all terminate just within or beyond the Perimeter, with the exception of Langford Parkway, limiting the transportation options in the central city.

This strong automotive reliance has resulted in heavy [[traffic]] and contributes to Atlanta's [[air pollution]], which has made Atlanta one of the more polluted cities in the country.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Copeland  | first = Larry  | title = Atlanta pollution going nowhere  | work = USA TODAY  | publisher = Gannett Co. Inc  | date=  2001-01-31  | url = http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2001/2001-01-31-atlanta-pollution.htm  | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> [[The Clean Air Campaign]] was created in 1996 to help reduce pollution in metro Atlanta.

Around 2008 the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top of the longest average commute times in the U.S. Also, the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top for worst traffic in the country.<ref>{{cite news | title = Atlanta traffic the worst in America | url = http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/04/28/daily97.html | date=2008-05-01}}</ref>

===Public transportation===
{{Main|Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|Streetcars in Atlanta|Commuter rail in Atlanta|Trolleybuses in Atlanta}}
[[File:MARTA - N3 Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] provides public transportation in Atlanta]]
Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage, Atlanta's [[rapid transit|subway]] system, operated by [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] (MARTA), is the [[List of United States Rapid Transit systems by Ridership|seventh busiest in the country]],<ref name=APTA>American Public Transportation Association, [http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q4hr.pdf Heavy Rail Transit Ridership Report], Fourth Quarter 2007.</ref> while MARTA's bus system is the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|14th largest in the country]].

Various proposals would bring [[Streetcars in Atlanta|streetcars back to Atlanta]]. The Downtown Connector route, now funded, will connect Centennial Olympic Park with [[Peachtree Center]] and the [[Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site|MLK historic site]]. Other proposed routes include lines along the 22-mile [[Beltline (Atlanta)|Beltline]] around Atlanta's central neighborhoods, as well as on Peachtree Street, Ralph David Abernathy Blvd., North Ave., and 17th St.<ref>[[Streetcars in Atlanta]]</ref> Proposals also exist for a [[commuter rail]] system, MARTA rail line extensions, [[light rail]] lines, [[bus rapid transit]], and more suburban express buses.<ref>http://dot.ga.gov/aboutGeorgiadot/Board/Documents/2010Presentations/September/Concept3.pdf</ref>

===Intercity rail===
Atlanta began as a railroad town and it still serves as a major rail junction, with several freight lines belonging to [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] intersecting below street level in downtown. It is the home of major [[classification yard]]s for both railroads, Inman Yard on the NS and Tilford Yard on the CSX. Long-distance passenger service is provided by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent train]], which connects Atlanta with many cities between New Orleans and New York. The [[Peachtree Station|Amtrak station]] is located several miles north of downtown<U+2014>and it lacks a connection to the MARTA rail system. An ambitious, long-standing proposal would create a Multi-Modal Passenger Terminal downtown, adjacent to Philips Arena and the Five Points MARTA station, which would link, in a single facility, MARTA bus and rail, intercity bus services, proposed commuter rail services to other Georgia cities, and Amtrak.
