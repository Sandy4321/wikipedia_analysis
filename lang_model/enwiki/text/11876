'''Gerringong''' is a town located about ten minutes<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.kiama.com.au/discover/townships/gerringong|title = Tourism Kiama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Kiama Visitor Centre|last = |first = }}</ref> south of [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]] in the [[Illawarra, New South Wales|Illawarra]] region of [[New South Wales]], Australia in the [[Municipality of Kiama]].

Supposedly great fear was caused to tribes there by the sight of [[Captain Cook]]'s ship in full sail. There are other theories as to the meaning of the name.

== History ==
The first European settlers were [[Toona australis|red cedar]] cutters, who were first recorded as having visited and logged in the area in 1814. As in much of coastal New South Wales, the cleared land was used for dairy farming and cedar cutting died out, as the cedar trees disappeared. Dairy farming became the predominant primary industry and remains so to this day. Gerringong had a small boat harbour used for the export of cedar and dairy produce.<ref name=history/>

In 1824, [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]] reserved 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) for the present Gerringong township. In 1827, Michael Hindmarsh and his family were granted 640 acres (2.6&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) and became the first settler in the Gerringong area. In 1829, Gerringong was incorporated into the [[mail|postal]] system. ''Alne Bank'' homestead was built in 1851 for the Hindmarsh family, who still live there today and occasionally open it for inspection.

In 1854, a town plan for Gerringong was approved and the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] proclaimed it a village. In 1872, the business area, [[Church of England]] church and some houses were destroyed by a [[bush fire]]. In 1893, the [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast railway line]] was extended to Gerringong,<ref>{{cite web

In 1933, Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] undertook his historic flight from nearby Seven Mile Beach to [[New Zealand]]. A memorial stone at [[Gerroa, New South Wales|Gerroa]] marks the event.

In 1954, Gerringong Municipal District amalgamated with Kiama Municipal Council. The town water supply was connected in 1971, signalling an end to tanks attached to each house. Land along the coastal fringe tends to receive higher rainfall than the interior water catchment areas, which are often in rainshadow. In 2002, the town sewerage system was connected.<ref>{{cite web

== Modern Gerringong==
The population of Gerringong and the area is around 4,000 people and growing. Many are retirees from Sydney and [[Canberra]], others enjoy the seaside lifestyle but commute to work in [[Wollongong]] or [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]] and even Sydney. The main local industries are agriculture (including dairying and vineyards), tourism and retail trade.

The town has a modern primary school, a town hall (built 1948), a large retirement village and a thriving tourist industry. Especially in the summer months, when visitors (mostly from Sydney and [[Canberra]]) flock to the pristine beaches, to enjoy swimming, surfing, fishing and relaxing in the restaurants and caf<U+00E9>s plus hunting for treasures in the shops and boutiques. There are two vineyards producing award-winning wines, one with cellar-door sales.

[[Gerringong railway station, New South Wales|Gerringong railway station]] is served by [[NSW TrainLink]]' s [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast Line]]. Services are provided by diesel trains, which connect with electric trains to Sydney at [[Kiama]]. Local bus companies connect Gerringong to [[Kiama]] and [[Nowra]] on a daily basis, and interstate buses connect it with Sydney and [[Melbourne]] and all stops in between.

The Gerringong and District Historical Society runs the Heritage Museum, containing lots of fascinating items, scale models of buildings, a photographic record of motor racing on Seven Mile Beach in the 1920s, and a display on the local dairying industry. The Society has a facility to do genealogy computer searches of a full database of Pioneer Family descendants, and also Birth, Death and Marriage records relating to the Gerringong area.

== Major highway upgrade ==
In 2012, a major highway upgrade commenced in Gerringong. The upgrade provides 7.5 kilometres of upgraded highway and includes two new interchanges with access to Gerringong and Gerroa.

The major infrastructure project includes a new overpass over the Omega rail level crossing, major highway widening, with additional exits and safer on and off ramps.<ref name="Gerringong Upgrade">{{cite web|title=Gerringong Upgrade|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/south-coast/gerringong-upgrade/index.html}}</ref>

The $329 million upgrade is due to be fully completed in early 2015.<ref name="Gerringong Upgrade">{{cite web|title=Gerringong Upgrade|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/south-coast/gerringong-upgrade/index.html}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:E940P-Gerringong-Rose-Valley.jpg|thumb|View of Rose Valley and (on the horizon) Gerringong]]
[[File:Gerringong to Kiama Coastline.jpg|thumb|A coastal headland north of the town. The Kiama Coast Walk can be seen faintly along the hill.]]
The boundaries of the Gerringong District range from Mount Pleasant and [[Omega, New South Wales|Omega]] in the north, to [[Rose Valley, New South Wales|Rose Valley]], [[Willow Vale, New South Wales (Kiama)|Willow Vale]] and [[Foxground, New South Wales|Foxground]] in the west, and to [[Broughton Village, New South Wales|Broughton Village]], [[Toolijooa, New South Wales|Toolijooa]], [[Harley Hill, New South Wales|Harley Hill]], [[Gerroa, New South Wales|Gerroa]] and [[Seven Mile Beach, New South Wales|Seven Mile Beach]] in the south. In the centre of the area lies the town of Gerringong itself, and the nearby area of [[Werri Beach, New South Wales|Werri Beach]].

Gerringong is known as "Where the Mountains Meet the Sea" due to an advertising campaign. A spur of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] reaches down to Mt Pleasant to the north of Gerringong township, ending the spectacular Illawarra escarpment, which starts north of [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]]. The area is famous for its picturesque coastline, incorporating rugged sea cliffs, pristine golden beaches surrounded by rolling hills and countryside, which stays velvety green year-round.

The [[Princes Highway]] bypasses Gerringong township on its western edge, with two exits, one at Fern St and another at Belinda Street, 2&nbsp;km further south. Gerringong and Werri Beach used to be two separate localities, but they have now grown together without any definitive boundary.

Werri Lagoon, which sometimes empties to the sea at the northern end of Werri Beach, used to naturally exit near the Gerringong Surf Club at the south end... until human intervention occurred in the 1960s. Bridges Road used to be access to a bridge which provided access to Werri Beach. More often that not nowadays, the lagoon is isolated from the sea by a sand-spit which has to be opened by mechanical means to allow it to drain after high rainfall or lengthy periods of closure, which results in [[water stagnation|stagnation]] and [[water pollution|pollution]]. When extra high tides occur, the water still washes over Pacific Avenue at the south end, where the lagoon previously emptied into the ocean.

Werri Lagoon is now part of the Kiama Coast Walk, which stretches from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon. The walking track extends for six kilometres and took eleven years to prepare and construct.<ref>Daily Telegraph, 4 September 2009, p.30</ref> It opened in October 2009.

Gerringong's Boatharbour, was extensively used for shipping timber and dairy produce in the 19th century. At one time a lengthy jetty existed, but it was destroyed in fierce storms in 1891. It was never rebuilt.

Gerringong's geology is basically [[basalt]], emplaced in the Permian period.

== Climate ==
Due to their close proximity, Gerringong has a climate similar to [[Kiama]], which has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') typical of southern and central New South Wales with warm summers and mild winters. Rainfall is spread relatively evenly throughout the year with the wettest months being in autumn and the driest in spring.
