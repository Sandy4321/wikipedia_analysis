'''Alexander Valerievich Radulov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440> <U+0412><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435><U+0440><U+044C><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0420><U+0430><U+0434><U+0443><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432>}}; born July 5, 1986) is a [[Russia]]n professional [[ice hockey]] player currently playing for [[Salavat Yulaev Ufa]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). Radulov is the KHL's all-time assist leader with 125 career assists. He also holds the record for most points in a single KHL season with 80.

==Playing career==
===Junior career===
Radulov started his [[North America]]n career in 2004<U+2013>05, being drafted at the 2004 CHL Import player draft by the [[Quebec Remparts]] in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) from the [[Canadian Hockey League]] (CHL). That year, he finished third in scoring for his team, with 75 points in 65 games, behind [[Josh Hennessy]] and Karl Gagn<U+00E9>.

The following year, he became one of the most exciting and dominant players to play in the QMJHL. In the first half of the season, he and rookie [[Angelo Esposito]] formed one of the most explosive duos in the league. He became equally renowned for skating in front of the opposing team's bench and twirling his stick around and banging the handle on the ice, as if to put a sword into a sheath, after scoring a goal, something that angered opposing players but captivated and inspired his coach, [[Patrick Roy]].

On October 28, 2005, he set a new franchise record with 6 goals against the [[Drummondville Voltigeurs]]. He added an assist in the win (11<U+2013>3). That night, Radulov tied the Quebec Remparts team's record with [[Eric Chouinard]] for most points in a single game (seven). Later, on March 19, 2006, in a game against the 2005 [[Memorial Cup]] second-place finishing [[Rimouski Oc<U+00E9>anic]], for whom his teammates [[Cedrick Desjardins]] and [[Michal Sersen]] played for in 2004<U+2013>05, Radulov wrote history in the [[Qu<U+00E9>bec Colis<U+00E9>e]] by scoring an amazing seven goals and four assists for 11 points, breaking both records for most goals and points in a single game for the Remparts, in a 16<U+2013>3 victory.

Radulov owns the Remparts record for the most consecutive point streak games with 50, passing the 28 game mark established by <U+00C9>ric Chouinard in 1999<U+2013>00. He's ranked second all-time with that sequence in the QMJHL, only behind [[Mario Lemieux]] with 62. 

Radulov finished as the scoring leader for the QMJHL and the CHL in 2005<U+2013>2006 with 152 points (61 goals, 91 assists). He currently owns the record for the most point in a single season for the Remparts, beating the mark of 120 set by [[Simon Gagn<U+00E9>]] in 1998<U+2013>99. He also owns the record for the most goals and assists in a season as a Remparts. He passed the mark of 57 goals set by <U+00C9>ric Chouinard and the mark of 75 assists set by Wes Scanzano, both back in 1999<U+2013>00. He also tied with [[Pavel Rosa]] for the most points by a QMJHL European player in a single season.  His 61 goals were second-highest in the QMJHL for the 2005<U+2013>06 season; Maxime Boisclair of the [[Chicoutimi Saguen<U+00E9>ens]] was first with 70.

In the 2006 playoffs, Radulov tallied 55 points (21 goals, 34 assists) and was ranked again as the scoring leader. He registered at least a point in each game. Radulov went only two points shy from playoff point record set by [[Simon Gamache]] in 2000<U+2013>01.  In the Remparts' semi-final series against the [[Acadie-Bathurst Titan]], he had 19 points in the seven-game series alone. He lost the MVP to victorious [[Moncton Wildcats]] forward [[M<U+0101>rti<U+0146><U+0161> Karsums]], a [[Boston Bruins]] prospect from [[Latvia]].

All team records set by Radulov are for the new edition of the Remparts, which began in the 1997<U+2013>98 season.

Radulov delivered an incredible performance in the Remparts' 2006 [[Memorial Cup]] championship game victory over the Moncton Wildcats. In the 6<U+2013>2 win, he netted two goals and assisted on three more, totaling five points, one point away from tying the all-time record in a Memorial Cup final. He registered nine points (five goals, four assists) in four games and won the [[Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy]] as the tournament MVP.

On November 28, 2007, the Remparts retired Radulov's number 22 jersey.

===Professional career===
During Radulov's [[2005<U+2013>06 QMJHL season]], he was signed to a three-year NHL contract by the [[Nashville Predators]] on January 9, 2006. He would begin his professional career as a member of the Predator's farm team, the [[Milwaukee Admirals]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), the following season. He was selected player of the week on October 16, 2006, posting two goals and four assists in only two games.

On October 21, 2006, Radulov made his NHL debut with the Nashville Predators against the [[Vancouver Canucks]], logging seven minutes and one minor penalty. He scored his first career NHL goal on his first career shot against the [[San Jose Sharks]] on October 26. Following another reassignment to [[Milwaukee]], Radulov remained on the Nashville roster for the rest of the [[2006<U+2013>07 NHL season|2006<U+2013>07 season]] after he was recalled on November 21, 2006.

In Game Two of the first round of the [[2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], Radulov was suspended for one game for his hit on [[San Jose Sharks]] forward [[Steve Bernier]]. Hitting him from behind, Bernier was sent into the boards head first and lay motionless on the ice for three minutes, before being helped off by teammates [[Joe Thornton]] and [[Marcel Goc]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Predators forward Radulov suspended one game|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2007/04/14/scott-hartnell.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-07-18|date=2007-04-14}}</ref> However, Bernier did not suffer any serious injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bernier not seeking revenge|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20070416/ai_n19014250|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Oakland Tribune|last=Chi|first=Victor}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On July 11, 2008, it was announced that although Radulov was still under contract with the Nashville Predators for one more season, he had signed a three-year deal with [[Salavat Yulaev Ufa]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). Radulov had previously notified the Predators organization of his desire to play in Russia, stating that he was being offered better conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radulov the latest NHLer to sign in Russia|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=243143&lid=headline&lpos=topStory_nhl|publisher=TSN|accessdate=2008-07-12|date=2008-07-11}}</ref>  Immediately after the announcement, the Predators, [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) all released statements emphasizing that Radulov's contract obligated him to the Predators through the [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09 season]] and that signing with a team in Russia was a direct violation of an agreement made the previous day between the NHL and all international hockey leagues to respect players' existing contracts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preds, NHL Issue Statements Regarding Reports on Alexander Radulov |url=http://predators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=368251|publisher=[[Nashville Predators]]|accessdate=2008-07-12|date=2008-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NHL, Russians make progress, but still no transfer agreement|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=368175&page=NewsPage&service=page|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|accessdate=2008-07-12|date=2008-07-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> After the IIHF ordered that Ufa void Radulov's contract, Ilya Kochevrin, vice-president of the KHL, argued that Radulov was signed on July 5, before the agreement was made on July 10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexander Radulov:KHL to allow contract|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/38394-alexander-radulov-khl-to-allow-contract|last=McRae|first=Kevin|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref>  While the contract remains disputed, the IIHF suspended Radulov from international play on July 18 as investigations continued,<ref>{{Cite web|title=IIHF suspends 6 players, investigates transfers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/07/18/hockey-transfers.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-07-20|date=2008-07-18}}</ref> a suspension that was lifted soon enough as it appeared there was no legal ground to suspend Radulov.

After giving Radulov a September 1 deadline to notify his intentions to return to Nashville, the Predators suspended him, on September 2, without pay for the [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/ctvnews/?id=248295|title=Predators suspend Radulov indefinitely without pay|accessdate=2008-09-02|publisher=TSN}}</ref>
