'''Cork Gunpowder Explosion'''  ([[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]] November 3, 1810)

Twenty two people were [[death|killed]] and over forty injured when [[gunpowder]] stored in a laborer's [[house]] in Brandy Lane, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[explode]]d. A subsequent inquiry revealed that several [[employees]] of the [[Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills]] (then the largest gunpowder [[manufacturing plant]] in the world), had been systematically stealing the material which was then sold on to [[quarrymen]] for [[rock blasting]].

Figures compiled by the Gunpowder Works authorities showed that almost half a [[ton]] was unaccounted for in the nine-month period preceding the disaster.

During the course of the inquiry it was discovered that the illicit gunpowder had to be dried when brought to the Brandy Lane house. The method chosen, somewhat unwisely on hindsight, was to use a lit candle. In addition, one of the men involved on the night of the explosion, was seen [[drinking]] heavily in a local [[tavern]].

A disaster [[fundraising|fund]] was opened for the victims and their [[dependents]] to which over <U+00A3>12,000 was subscribed within two weeks.<ref>A Dictionary of Irish History, D.J.Hickey & J.E.Doherty,  Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, 1980. Pp. page 96. ISBN 0-7171-1567-4</ref>
