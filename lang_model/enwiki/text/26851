The '''2007<U+2013>2008 Nazko earthquakes''' were a series of small [[earthquake]]s measuring less than 4.0&nbsp;on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]. They took place in the sparsely populated [[Nazko, British Columbia|Nazko]] area of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central Interior of British Columbia]] starting on Tuesday, October 9, 2007. Their [[epicenter]]s were near the upper [[Baezaeko River]], {{Convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Nazko Cone]], a small tree-covered [[cinder cone]] that last erupted about 7,200&nbsp;years ago. The [[earthquake swarm|swarm of earthquakes]] is unique in that it is the only notable concentration of seismicity in the [[Canadian Cordillera]] away from the [[British Columbia Coast]].<ref name="PY"/>

No damages or casualties resulted from the Nazko earthquakes, which were too small to be felt by people, but local [[seismometer|seismographs]] recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]]. This is an east-west trending {{Convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} long line of [[volcano]]es that extends from just north of [[Vancouver Island]] to near the small city of [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]].<ref name="SI"/>

==Geology==
The 2007<U+2013>2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is interpreted to have originated {{Convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface. The character of the [[seismic wave]]s indicate that the swarm originated from a magmatic source. It could have formed as a result of rock fracturing at the tip of a [[dike (geology)|dike]] and/or by movement along [[fault (geology)|fault]] planes due to changes in the local [[stress field]] by the expansion and movement of [[magma]].<ref name="AS"/> This magmatic activity is potentially linked to the hypothesized [[Anahim hotspot]], a [[mantle plume]] that is likely responsible for older [[volcanism]] throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt.<ref name="PY">{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/e81-078|title=McNaughton Lake seismicity<U+2014>more evidence for an Anahim hotspot?|publisher=[[NRC Research Press]]|last=Rogers|first=Garry C.|url=http://rparticle.web-p.cisti.nrc.ca/rparticle/AbstractTemplateServlet?journal=cjes&volume=18&year=&issue=&issue=&msno=e81-078&calyLang=eng|date=2010-01-12|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref> This [[volcanic belt]] includes the [[Rainbow Range (Chilcotin Plateau)|Rainbow]], [[Ilgachuz Range|Ilgachuz]] and [[Itcha Range|Itcha]] range [[shield volcano]]es west of the Nazko swarm.<ref name="LP"/> Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older to west of the Nazko swarm, indicating that the [[North American Plate]] is moving in a westerly direction with respect to the [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of {{Convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|3.3|cm|mm|abbr=on}} per year.<ref name="GT">{{cite journal|last=Bevier|first=Mary Lou|coauthors=Armstrong, Richard Lee; Souther, J.

The 2007<U+2013>2008 Nazko earthquakes occurred roughly between the Itcha Range and Nazko Cone.]]
Before the Nazko earthquake swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot was not known to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] 1.0&nbsp;on the Richter magnitude scale, but at least one earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, the [[Natural Resources Canada]] has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200&nbsp;year old Nazko Cone.<ref name="GI">{{cite web|title=Modelling and Analysis of the Earthquake Zones of British Columbia Using Three-Dimensional Mining Software|publisher=Micromine North America|last=LeBlanc|first=Alan|url=http://www.infomine.com/publications/docs/LeBlanc2009.pdf|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref>

Even though earthquake swarms can be dangerous, scientists are able to model such events to analyze their structure.<ref name="GI"/> During the earthquake swarm in 2007, a group of scientists investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the [[United States Geological Survey]], the [[University of Washington]], and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes likely originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone.<ref name="FI">{{cite news|title=B.C.'s micro-quake swarm not likely to lead to eruption|publisher=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/10/25/bc-microquake.html|accessdate=2010-01-13 | date=2007-10-25}}</ref> However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in [[North America]] that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under [[Lake Tahoe]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] and a 2004 earthquake swarm at [[Jordan Craters]] in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].<ref name="SI"/>

==Number of earthquakes==
[[File:2007-2008 Nazko swarm location.png|thumb|right|250px|alt=The earthquakes are in a ten-kilometer east-west stripe that is about ten kilometers west of Nazko Cone.|Overlapped cyan circles indicate the locations of earthquakes that were associated with the Nazko swarm.]]
More than 1,000&nbsp;earthquakes were recorded by regional seismic networks within three weeks of October 20, 2007. Because the seismometers that recorded the Nazko swarm were more than {{Convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from where the earthquakes took place, the locations of the [[hypocenter]]s were measured with poor resolution. Following the earthquake, five seismometers were placed by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] from September 2007 to June 2008 close to the hypocenter.<ref name="AS">{{cite web|title=Repeating earthquakes recorded during a period of seismic unrest near Nazko Cone, British Columbia|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|author=Hutchinson, J.A.|coauthors=Caplan Auerbach, J.|url=http://cgrg.geog.uvic.ca/abstracts/HutchinsonRepeatingThe.html|date=2009|accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> Analysis of the data recorded by these seismometers indicates a much larger total number of earthquakes. For example, at least 597&nbsp;earthquakes were recognized during a period of only six hours.<ref name="SI"/>

At least two episodes of earthquakes constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 29 to November 1, 2007, a total of 153&nbsp;earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428&nbsp;earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes in the development of the earthquake swarm. [[Correlation coefficient]]s were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.<ref name="AS"/>

==Scientific response==
The earthquake swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the [[Prince George Citizen]] by citizen staff, three days after the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist [[John Cassidy (seismologist)|John Cassidy]] of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist [[Catherine Hickson]], who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, "the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all."<ref name="CB">{{cite news|last=Nielsen|first=Mark|title=Earthquakes recorded near dormant volcano|publisher=[[Prince George Citizen]]|date=October 12, 2007|url=http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:u1nhcqp_bmwJ:www.princegeorgecitizen.com/2007101299462/local/news/earthquakes-recorded-near-dormant-volcano.html+%22Earthquakes+recorded+near+dormant+volcano%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a|accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, volcanologist Catherine Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly [[explosive eruption]] like those that can occur in [[subduction|subduction-zone]] volcanoes. "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact...but it'll be extremely exciting," Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a [[lava fountain]] that sends globs of lava {{Convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} into the air. This is similar to those that occur in [[Hawaii]]. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] would be released during the event.<ref name="CB"/>

==Preparedness and hazards==
Because no seismographs were close enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the earthquakes began, employees of [[Natural Resources Canada]] placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure [[sound wave]]s that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing.<ref name="SI">{{cite web|title=Chronology of Events in 2007 at Nazko Cone|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|date=2008-07-09|url=http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/nazko/nazko_summary-eng.php|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref> These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes.<ref name=Johnson_et_al_2004>{{cite journal|title=Volcanic eruptions observed with infrasound|last1=Johnson|first1=J.B.|last2=Aster|first2=R.C.|last3=Kyle|first3=P.R.|journal=Geophysical Research Letters

The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in [[soil]] and under [[snow]]. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.<ref name="SI"/>

The 2007<U+2013>2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is one of numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Other regions that have experienced earthquakes related to volcanic activity include [[Mount Meager]] (seventeen events), [[Mount Cayley]] (four events), [[Mount Garibaldi]] (three events), [[Silverthrone Caldera]] (two events), [[Castle Rock (volcano)|Castle Rock]] (two events), [[Hoodoo Mountain]] (eight events), [[Crow Lagoon]] (four events), [[The Volcano (British Columbia)|The Volcano]] (five events), and the [[Mount Edziza volcanic complex]] (eight events).<ref name="AA">{{cite book | last = Etkin | first = David | coauthors = Haque, C.E. and Brooks, Gregory R. | title = An Assessment of Natural Hazards and Disasters in Canada | publisher = Springer | date = 2003-04-30 | location = | pages =569, 582, 583 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=kaJz_SNNuKMC&pg=PA569&lpg=PA569&dq=wells+%22gray+clearwater%22+volcanic+field+earthquakes| isbn = 978-1-4020-1179-5}}</ref> Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active [[magma chamber]]s, indicating possible future eruptive activity.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/gscvol_e.php|title=Volcanology in the Geological Survey of Canada|work=Volcanoes of Canada|accessdate=2008-05-09}}</ref> Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential hazards. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes with a history of significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.<ref name="AA"/>

If magma were to rise towards the surface of Nazko, new earthquake swarms would occur, with a significant increase in the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would likely create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200&nbsp;years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area likely would be forest fires and, if an [[eruption column]] were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.<ref name="SI"/>
