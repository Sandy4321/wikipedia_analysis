On 26 May, all 125 commercial fishing boats helping in the clean up were ordered ashore after some workers began experiencing health problems.<ref name="AutoBB-102"/> On 29 May 2010, ten oil spill clean-up workers had been admitted to West Jefferson Medical Center in [[Marrero, Louisiana|Marrero]], Louisiana. All but two had been hospitalized suffering from symptoms emergency room doctors diagnosed as dehydration. At a press briefing about the 26 May medical evacuation of seven crewmembers from Vessels of Opportunity working in the Breton Sound area, USCG Captain Meredith Austin, Unified Command Deputy Incident Commander in [[Houma, LA]], said that air monitoring done before beginning work showed no volatile organic compounds above limits of concern. No respiratory protection was issued, said Austin "because air ratings were taken and there were no values found to be at an unsafe level, prior to us sending them in there."<ref name="AutoBB-226"/>

On 15 June, Marylee Orr, Executive Director for Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN),<ref name="AutoBB-227"/> said on [[MSNBC]]'s [[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]] that first responders to the crisis and residents living along the coast were getting very sick, with symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, nausea, headaches, and chest pains. By 21 June, 143 oil spill exposure cases had been reported to the [[Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals]] (DHH)<!-- cited below-->; 108 of those cases involved workers in the clean-up efforts, while 35 were reported by gulf residents.<ref name="AutoBB-230"/>

The [[United States National Academies|U.S. National Academies]] [[Institute of Medicine]] held a workshop to assess known health effects of this and previous oil spills and to coordinate epidemiological monitoring and ongoing medical research. The Louisiana state health officer Jimmy Guidry stated, <U+201C>This is more than a spill. This is ongoing leakage of a chemical, and adding chemicals to stop the chemicals. We're feeling like we're in a research lab."<ref name="AutoBB-231"/><ref name="AutoBB-232"/> On the second day of the meeting the suicide of William Allen Kruse, a charter boat captain working as a BP clean-up worker,<ref name="AutoBB-233"/> intensified previous expert commentary on the current and likely long-term mental health effects of the ongoing crisis. David Abramson, director of research for Columbia's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, noted the increased risk of mental disorders and stress-related health problems.<ref name="AutoBB-234"/><ref name="AutoBB-235"/> On 10 August, the [[Institute of Medicine]] released a Workshop Summary: [http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Assessing-the-Effects-of-the-Gulf-of-Mexico-Oil-Spill-on-Human-Health.aspx Assessing the Effects of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill on Human Health].

====Chemical poisoning====
Chemicals from the oil and dispersant are believed to be the cause of these illnesses. According to chemist Bob Naman, the addition of dispersants created an even more toxic substance when mixed with crude oil. Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are making people sick, he said. PAH's contain compounds that have been identified as [[carcinogenic]], [[mutagenic]], and [[teratogenic]]. "The dispersants are being added to the water and are causing chemical compounds to become water soluble, which is then given off into the air, so it is coming down as rain, in addition to being in the water and beaches". Naman added, "I<U+2019>m scared of what I'm finding. These cyclic compounds intermingle with Corexit and generate other cyclic compounds that aren't good. Many have double bonds, and many are on the EPA's danger list. This is an unprecedented environmental catastrophe." 

Mike Robicheux, a Louisiana physician who has been treating people he says are sick from exposure to BP's toxic chemicals, told Al Jazeera in May 2011, "This is the biggest public health crisis from a chemical poisoning in the history of this country. We are going to have thousands of people who are extremely sick, and if they aren't treated, a large number of them are going to die."<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2011/05/2011512141926468292.html Exposing the human side of BP's oil spill - Interactive - Al Jazeera English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Dr. [[Riki Ott]] has been working with oil-spill related illness since the [[Exxon Valdez]]. She assisted in the Gulf after the spill and said: "People are already dying from this... I<U+2019>m dealing with three autopsies' right now. I don<U+2019>t think we<U+2019>ll have to wait years to see the effects like we did in Alaska, people are dropping dead now. I know two people who are down to 4.75 per cent of their lung capacity, their heart has enlarged to make up for that, and their esophagus is disintegrating, and one of them is a 16-year-old boy who went swimming in the Gulf." Paul Doom, the 16 year old, said "I have documentation and images showing lesions in my brain... that are the same as lesions on the brains of marine life from the Exxon Valdez spill from marine necropsies. This is a life and death situation and a race against time."<ref name="AutoBB-236"/><ref name="AutoBB-237"/><ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201138152955897442.html Gulf spill sickness wrecking lives - Features - Al Jazeera English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to Mississippi Riverkeeper of the [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], blood samples from 8 people from Pensacola, Florida and Alabama, residents and BP cleanup workers <U+201C>were analyzed for volatile solvents and all came back with ethylbenzene and m,p-xylene in excess of 95th percentile values of 0.11 ppb for [[ethylbenzene]] and 0.34 ppb for m,p-[[xylene]].<U+201D> The highest concentration value was four times the 95th percentile. The blood of all 8 individuals "had chemicals that are found in the BP crude oil<U+201D>, the report went on to say.<ref name="AutoBB-238"/> 

In August 2011, The Government Accountability Project (GAP) began a survey of the health effects of the oil spill on cleanup workers. Reports included "eye, nose and throat irritation; respiratory problems; blood in urine, vomit and rectal bleeding; seizures; nausea and violent vomiting episodes that last for hours; skin irritation, burning and lesions; short-term memory loss and confusion; liver and kidney damage; central nervous system effects and nervous system damage; hypertension; and miscarriages". Cleanup workers claimed to have been threatened with termination when requesting respirators, because it would <U+201C>look bad in media coverage,<U+201D> or they were told that respirators were unnecessary, as Corexit was <U+201C>as safe as Dawn dishwashing soap<U+201D>. Cleanup workers and residents reported being sprayed directly with Corexit, with skin lesions and blurred eyesight as the result. Dr. James Diaz, writing for the ''American Journal of Disaster Medicine'', said these ailments appearing in the Gulf reflected those reported after previous oil spills, like the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|Exxon Valdez]]. Diaz warned that "chronic adverse health effects, including cancers, liver and kidney disease, mental health disorders, birth defects and developmental disorders should be anticipated among sensitive populations and those most heavily exposed". Diaz also believes neurological disorders should be expected.<ref name="AutoBB-239"/>

Regarding Corexit, [[Riki Ott]] noted, "The dispersants used in BP's draconian experiment contain solvents, such as petroleum distillates and 2-butoxyethanol. Solvents dissolve oil, grease, and rubber. It should be no surprise that solvents are also notoriously toxic to people, something the medical community has long known".<ref name="shrimp"/> In April 2012, [[Al Jazeera]] reported that residents and cleanup workers were testing positive for hydrocarbons from BP's oil and dispersant in their blood. Riki Ott explained that the chemicals "evaporate in air and are easily inhaled, they penetrate skin easily, and they cross the placenta into fetuses. For example, 2-butoxyethanol is a human health hazard substance; it is a fetal toxin and it breaks down blood cells, causing blood and kidney disorders". Louisianan's Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] said those impacted will be compensated by BP.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/04/2012420725163795.html BP blamed for ongoing health problems - Features - Al Jazeera English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Fisheries===
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-21.png|thumb|As of 21 June 2010, the area closed to fishing encompassed {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or about 36% of Gulf of Mexico federal waters.|alt=21 June 2010 NOAA map of the Gulf of Mexico showing the areas closed to fishing.]]
In BP's Initial Exploration Plan, dated 10 March 2009, it said that "it is unlikely that an accidental spill would occur" and "no adverse activities are anticipated" to fisheries or fish habitat.<ref name="Initial Exploration Plan Mississippi Canyon"/> On 29 April 2010, [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in the state after weather forecasts predicted the oil slick would reach the Louisiana coast.<ref name="state of emergency"/> An emergency shrimping season was opened on 29 April so that a catch could be brought in before the oil advanced too far.<ref name="CITEREFbbc2010a"/> By 30 April, the USCG received reports that oil had begun washing up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].<ref name="fishing1"/>  On 22 May 2010, the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board stated said 60 to 70% of [[oyster]] and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] harvesting areas and 70 to 80% of fin-fisheries remained open.<ref name="AutoBB-198"/> The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals closed an additional ten oyster beds on 23 May, just south of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], Louisiana, citing confirmed reports of oil along the state's western coast.<ref name="AutoBB-199"/>

On 2 May 2010, NOAA closed commercial and recreational fishing in affected federal waters between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Pensacola Bay. The closure initially incorporated {{convert|6814|sqmi}}.<ref name="AutoBB-200"/><ref name="AutoBB-201"/> By 21 June, NOAA had increased the area under closure over a dozen times, encompassing by that date {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and extending along the coast from [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya Bay]], Louisiana to [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], Florida.<ref name="AutoBB-202"/><ref name="AutoBB-203"/> On 24 May, the federal government declared a fisheries disaster for the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.<ref name="AutoBB-204"/> Initial cost estimates to the fishing industry were $2.5&nbsp;billion.<ref name="fishing1" />

On 23 June, NOAA ended its fishing ban in {{convert|8000|sqmi}}, leaving {{convert|78597|sqmi}} with no fishing allowed,<ref name="AutoBB-205"/> or about one-third of the Gulf. The continued fishing ban was meant to assure the safety of seafood, and NOAA inspectors announced that as of 9 July, Kevin Griffis of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] said, only one seafood sample out of 400 tested did not pass, and even that one did not include "concerning levels of contaminants".<ref name="Skoloff"/> On 10 August, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said no one had seen oil in a {{convert|8000|sqmi}} area east of Pensacola since 3 July, so the fishing ban in that area was being lifted.<ref name="AutoBB-206"/>

On 31 August, a Boston lab hired by the United Commercial Fishermen's Association to analyze coastal fishing waters said it found dispersant in a seafood sample taken near Biloxi, Miss., almost a month after BP said it had stopped using the chemical.<ref name="AutoBB-207"/>

According to the [[European Space Agency]], the agency's satellite data was used by the Ocean Foundation to conclude that 20% of the juvenile [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] were killed by oil in the gulf's most important spawning area. The foundation combined satellite data showing the oil spill extent each week with data on weekly tuna spawning to make their conclusion. The agency also said that the loss of juvenile tuna was significant due to the 82% decline of the tuna's spawning stock in the western Atlantic during the 30 years before the oil spill.<ref name="AutoBB-208"/>

The waters had been reopened to fishing on 15 November 2010,<ref name="AutoBB-209"/> but on 24 November NOAA re-closed {{convert|4200|sqmi}} area to shrimping.<ref name="AutoBB-210"/> A Florida TV station sent frozen Gulf shrimp to be tested for petroleum by-products after recent reports showed scientists disagreed on whether it is safe to eat after the oil spill.<ref name="AutoBB-211"/> A private lab found levels of [[Anthracene]], a toxic hydrocarbon and a by-product of petroleum, at twice the levels the FDA finds acceptable.<ref name="AutoBB-212"/><ref name="AutoBB-213"/>  On 20 April, NOAA  reopened  {{convert|1041|sqmi}} of Gulf waters immediately surrounding the Deepwater Horizon wellhead to commercial and recreational fishing of fish, oysters, crabs and shrimp  after testing results found that 99 percent of samples contained no detectable dispersant residues or oil-related compounds, and the few samples that did contain  residues showed levels more than 1000 times lower than FDA levels of concern.  This was the twelfth and final reopening in federal waters since 22 July, and opened all the formerly closed areas in Federal waters.<ref name="AutoBB-214"/> Allowable levels for the toxins in Gulf seafood are based on health impacts for a 176 pound adult eating less than 2 medium shrimp per day.<ref name="AutoBB-215"/>

In July 2011 BP released a report<ref name="AutoBB-216"/> claiming that the economy had recovered and there was no reason to believe that anyone would suffer future losses from the spill, with the limited exception of oyster harvesters. However, Bruce Guerra, a crab fisherman in Louisiana for 25 years, said that since the BP oil spill crabbers are trapping 75 percent fewer crabs and that "crabs have been coming up dead, discolored, or riddled with holes since last year's spill".  Others in the fishing industry say it could take years to fully realize the spill's effects. "The problem is right when they used the dispersants, that's when the tuna came to the Gulf to spawn," said Cheril Carey, a national sales representative for a Louisiana company specializing in yellow fin tuna. "It takes a tuna five to 15 years to mature. So although we may have fish now, we may not have them in five to 15 years."<ref name="AutoBB-217"/>

In late 2012 local fishermen report that crab, shrimp, and oyster fishing operations have not yet recovered from the oil spill and many fear that the Gulf seafood industry will never recover.  One Mississippi shrimper who was interviewed said he used to get 8,000 pounds of shrimp in four days, but this year he got only 800 pounds a week.  Mississippi's oyster reefs have been closed since the spill started. A Louisanna fisherman said the local oyster industry might do 35 per cent this year, "If we're very lucky."  Dr Ed Cake, a biological oceanographer and a marine and oyster biologist, said that many of the Gulf fisheries have collapsed and "If it takes too long for them to come back, the fishing industry won't survive".<ref name="AutoBB-218"/>

===Tourism===
Although many people cancelled their vacations due to the spill, hotels close to the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported dramatic increases in business during the first half of May 2010. However, the increase was likely due to the influx of people who had come to work with oil removal efforts. Jim Hutchinson, assistant secretary for the Louisiana Office of Tourism, called the occupancy numbers misleading, but not surprising. "Because of the oil slick, the hotels are completely full of people dealing with that problem," he said. "They're certainly not coming here as tourists. People aren't sport fishing, they aren't buying fuel at the marinas, they aren't staying at the little hotels on the coast and eating at the restaurants."<ref name="thesunnews1"/>

On 25 May, BP gave Florida $25&nbsp;million to promote the beaches where the oil had not reached, and the company planned $15&nbsp;million each for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Bay Area Tourist Development Council bought [[digital billboard]]s showing recent photos from the gulf coast beaches as far north as [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee and [[Atlanta]]. Along with assurances that the beaches were so far unaffected, hotels cut rates and offered deals such as free golf. Also, cancellation policies were changed, and refunds were promised to those where oil may have arrived. However, revenues remained below 2009 levels.<ref name="thesunnews1"/><ref name="Anderson"/>

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23 billion, in a region that supports over 400,000 travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually.<ref name="AutoBB-219"/><ref name="AutoBB-220"/>

On 1 November, BP announced plans to spend $78&nbsp;million to help Louisiana tourism and test and advertise seafood.<ref name="newsobserver.com"/>

===Other economic consequences===

====BP's expenditures on the oil spill====
On 5 July 2010, BP reported that its own expenditures on the oil spill had reached $3.12&nbsp;billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid, and federal costs.<ref name="BP costs for oil spill response pass $3 billion"/>  As of 1 October 2010, BP has spent $11.2 billion.<ref name="newsobserver.com"/><ref name=abc011010/>  As of March 2012, BP estimated the company's total spill-related expenses do not exceed $37.2 billion.<ref name=settleAP />

The United States [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] limits BP's liability for non-cleanup costs to $75&nbsp;million unless gross negligence is proven.<ref name="AutoBB-221"/> BP has said it would pay for all cleanup and remediation regardless of the statutory liability cap. Nevertheless, some Democratic lawmakers sought to pass legislation that would increase the liability limit to $10&nbsp;billion.<ref name="AutoBB-222"/><!-- paywall, no date, no author available--><ref name="AutoBB-223"/> Analysts for [[Swiss Re]] have estimated that the total insured losses from the accident could reach $3.5&nbsp;billion. According to [[UBS]], final losses could be $12&nbsp;billion.<ref name=Timeslitigation/> According to [[Willis Group Holdings]], total losses could amount to $30&nbsp;billion, of which estimated total claims to the market from the disaster, including control of well, re-drilling, third-party liability and seepage and pollution costs, could exceed $1.2&nbsp;billion.<ref name="upstream040610"/>  

After announcement of the six-month moratorium on drilling in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico BP agreed to allocate $100&nbsp;million for payments to offshore oil workers who were unemployed due to the moratorium.<ref name=upstream170610/>

====Market value====
BP's stock fell by 52% in 50 days on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], going from $60.57 on 20 April 2010, to $29.20 on 9 June, its lowest level since August 1996. On 25 June, BP's market value reached a 1-year low. The company's total value lost since 20 April was $105&nbsp;billion. Investors saw their holdings in BP shrink to $27.02, a nearly 54% loss of value in 2010.<ref name="BP's stock hits new low"/> A month later, the company's loss in market value totalled $60 billion, a 35% decline since the explosion. At that time, BP reported a second-quarter loss of $17 billion, its first loss in 18 years. This included a one-time $32.2 billion charge, including $20 billion for the [[#Spill response fund|fund]] created for reparations and $2.9 billion in actual costs.<ref name="Wardell"/>

BP announced that it was setting up a new unit to oversee management of the oil spill and its aftermath, to be headed by former [[TNK-BP]] chief executive [[Bob Dudley|Robert Dudley]],<ref name="upstream080610"/> who a month later was named CEO of BP.<ref name=Wardell/>

On 1 October, BP's [[London Stock Exchange]] price reached 439.75 pence, the highest point since 28 May.<ref name="abc011010"/>

By 2013, BP had dropped from the second to the fourth largest of the four major oil companies.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-bp-results-urgent-idUSBRE91409C20130205?irpc=932 Smaller BP's profits down as oil spill trial looms | Reuters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Drop in sale====
BP gas stations in the United States, the majority of which the company does not own, reported sales off between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Some BP station owners that lost sales said the name should change back to [[Amoco]], while others said after all the effort that went into promoting BP, such a move would be a gamble, and the company should work to restore its image.<ref name="AutoBB-224"/>

====Real estate prices====
The real estate prices and a number of transactions in the Gulf of Mexico area decreased significantly during the period of the oil spill. As a result, area officials wanted the state legislature to allow [[property tax]] to be paid based on current market value, which according to [[Florida Legislature|State Rep.]] [[Dave Murzin]] could mean millions of dollars in losses for each county affected.<ref name="AutoBB-225"/>

===U.S. and Canadian offshore drilling policies===
{{Main|United States offshore drilling debate|2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium}}
{{See also|Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar}}
As a response to the disaster, on 30 April President [[Barack Obama]] ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a  review determined whether more safety systems were needed<ref name="bloomberg010510"/> and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.<ref name="CBS/AP"/> Later a six-month offshore drilling (below {{convert|500|ft}} of water) moratorium was enforced by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].<ref name="upstream240610"/> Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf.<ref name="CITEREFupstream2010a"/> The moratorium suspended work on 33&nbsp;rigs.<ref name=upstream240610/> It was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. On 22 June, a [[United States federal judge]] on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman]] when ruling in the case [[Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar]], lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified.<ref name=upstream240610/> The Department of Justice appealed to the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which granted the request for an expedited hearing. A three judge panel is scheduled to hear oral arguments on 8 July.<ref name="AutoBB-240"/><ref name="AutoBB-241"/>
[[File:US Oil Production and Imports 1920 to 2005.png|thumb|300px|U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1920 to 2005]]
On 30 June, Salazar said that "he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium".<ref name="upstream300610a"/> [[Michael Bromwich]], the head of the newly created [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], said that a record of "bad performance, deadly performance" by an oil company should be considered "a relevant factor" for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases.<ref name=upstream300610a/> Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of "extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations".<ref name="upstream300610b"/>

On 28 April, the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the [[Canadian Arctic]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast]], issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells.<ref name="canadian regulator response"/> Five days later, the Canadian [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Jim Prentice]] said the government would not approve a decision to relax safety or environment regulations for large energy projects.<ref name="prentice"/> On 3 May California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded [[Offshore oil and gas in California|offshore drilling projects in California]].<ref name="CSM20100503"/><ref name="BBC20100503"/> On 8 July, Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.<ref name="AutoBB-242"/><ref name="AutoBB-243"/>

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for 23.5% of [[Oil producing countries|U.S. oil production]].<ref name="AutoBB-244"/> The chief argument in the U.S. offshore drilling debate has been to make the United States less dependent on [[List of countries by oil imports|imported oil]].<ref name="AutoBB-245"/><ref name="AutoBB-246"/> American dependence on imports grew from 24% in 1970<ref name="AutoBB-247"/> to 66% in 2008.<ref name="AutoBB-248"/>

Local officials in Louisiana  expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.<ref name="CSM Sasser"/><ref name="CSM Sasser"/>
