'''Carlini Base''', ({{lang-es|Base Carlini}}) formerly known as '''Jubany Base''',<ref name=Dias>{{cite web|last=Dias|first=Gisele|last=Sousa|title=Por primera vez, una base ant<U+00E1>rtica argentina tendr<U+00E1> el nombre de un cient<U+00ED>fico|work=Clar<U+00ED>n|date=6 March 2012|url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Decreto-presidencial_0_658734299.html|accessdate=7 March 2012|language=Spanish}}</ref> is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] permanent base and scientific [[research station]] named after scientist Alejandro Ricardo Carlini (previously it had been named after Argentine naval pilot Jos<U+00E9> Isidro Jubany).<ref name=Dias/> It's located on [[Potter Cove]], [[King George Island (Antarctica)|King George Island]], in the [[South Shetland Islands]]. 

{{As of|2014}} Carlini is one of 13 research bases in Antarctica operated by Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/DIVULGAC/BASES.HTM|title=Argentine Antarctic Stations|publisher=Direcci<U+00F3>n Nacional del Ant<U+00E1>rtico <U+2014> Argentina|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130620202830/http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/DIVULGAC/BASES.HTM|archivedate=20 June 2013}}</ref> 

==History==
[[Potter Cove]], in the southwestern region of the King George Island in the South Shetland archipelago
was chosen around 1953 to host an Argentine naval station for amphibious aircraft support.<ref name=carlini1>{{cite web|url=http://www.marambio.aq/carlini.html|title=Base Carlini|publisher=Fundaci<U+00F2>n Marambio|language=Spanish|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130615074000/http://www.marambio.aq/carlini.html|archivedate=15 June 2013}}</ref>   

The refuge was established on 21 November 1953, being temporarily called Refugio Potter and then Caleta Potter Naval Station. In the summer campaign of 1953<U+2013>54 the shelter was inhabited by only three men.<ref name=carlini1/> It was proposed to name the base after naval aviator Jose Isidro Jubany, killed on duty on 14 September 1948; the station was thus renamed as Teniente Jubany in the course of the 1954<U+2013>55 campaign.<ref name=carlini1/> 

In the summer campaign of 1957<U+2013>1958 two groups of scientists working for the [[Argentine Antarctic Institute]] conducted geological survey work in the area, collecting petrographic and paleontological samples to study local geological upward movements. Dr. Otto Schneider was head of the first group and Osvaldo C. Schauer, chief of the second.<ref name=carlini1/>  

In 1982 the naval station facilities were transferred to the Argentine Antarctic Institute and the station was upgraded to the status of base, being inaugurated as such on 12 February.<ref name=carlini1/>  

In 1990 the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] of marine research, [[Germany]], began talks with the Argentine National Antarctic Institute, dealing with the installation of on-site laboratories and aquariums with modern equipment for scientific research. This new facility<U+2014>named Dallmann Laboratory<U+2014>was inaugurated on 20 January 1994, has an area of {{convert|250|m2|abbr=on}} and was built in mainland Argentina, disassembled, carried by ship to Potter Cove, and reassembled at the base.<ref name=carlini1/>

In 1994 the LAJUB laboratory for [[greenhouse effect]] research was installed in collaboration with the [[Institute of Atmospheric Physics]] (IFA), [[Italy]].<ref name=carlini1/>

On 5 March 2012, by decree 309/2012 of the Executive, the base was renamed to Base Carlini, after the late researcher Dr. Alejandro Ricardo Carlini, of distinguished trajectory in Antarctic scientific studies.<ref name=carlini1/>

On 8 December 2013 [[Metallica]] performed a concert at the base, under a small specially-built dome and without amplification due to ecological concerns. The show was streamed worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metallica.com/news/journey-to-the-bottom-of-the-earth.asp|title=Journey To The BOTTOM Of The Earth|publisher=Metallica|date=24 October 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131206231247/http://www.metallica.com/news/journey-to-the-bottom-of-the-earth.asp|archivedate=6 December 2013}}</ref>

==Description==
Since its upgrade to base status in 1982, Carlini's facilities have been continuously improved; {{as of|2014|alt=as of 2014}} they include: headquarters; housing for technical staff; weather station; LAJUB Laboratory; Dallmann Laboratory; emergency house; infirmary; radio station; power plant (both main and auxiliary, just for emergencies), garage and workhouse, warehouse for supplies, freezing chamber; incinerator and compactor for residues; installations for fuel pump, heat generation and fuel filtering & purification; various multiple use buildings; fuel tank array, antenna, heliport; geodetic [[GPS]] receiver station and seismography station.<ref name=carlini1/> This adds to a maximum lodging capacity for 60 people. {{As of|2014}} it has an average winter population of 20 people.

The base is located next to a colony of more than 16,000 [[penguin]]s and 650 [[sea lion]]s. The usual route to reach the base includes a flight from [[Ushuaia]] to [[Marambio Base]], and then sailing for a few days.

Carlini enables scientists from different areas to develop advanced research projects in the disciplines of the natural sciences. These tasks increase during the more active summer campaigns. For example, there have been studies on human behavior and its biochemical correlations; ecological aspects of [[benthic]], [[plankton]]ic and coastal populations; censuses within [[pinniped]] colonies (mainly [[elephant seal]]s and [[fur seal]]s); physical chemistry and biology of lakes, ponds and water bodies; tracing of ecotoxicological elements in the Antarctic [[ecosystem]]; continuous monitoring of long-term sea level in geology and geophysics operations; coastal ecology and [[microbiology]]; effect of [[UV radiation]] on marine [[phytoplankton]] and [[bacteria]]; etc.<ref name=carlini1/>

===Dallmann Laboratory===
At the Dallmann Laboratory<U+2014>a German-Argentine cooperation project<U+2014>multidisciplinary joint research programs are carried out in the fields of biology; coastal and terrestrial ecology; terrestrial wildlife (mostly elephants and seals); pollution effects on birds and fish populations; [[oceanography]]; coastal geology; etc.

The lab has three modules for bedrooms, bathroom and living-dining room, two modules for laboratories and one for the engine room and dive locker. It also has four containers for laboratory and aquarium use donated by Germany.<ref name=carlini1/>
It is equipped with several scientific instruments and vehicles provided by Germany: [[lyophilizer]], [[stereo microscope]]s, freezers, a small [[hyperbaric chamber]] for transport, [[scuba diving]] equipment, aquariums, a rigid hull boat and a [[K<U+00E4>ssbohrer]] tracked vehicle.<ref name=carlini1/>

The Argentine Antarctic Institute, the [[Netherlands Geosciences Foundation]] and the Alfred Wegener Institute signed an agreement to provide a biological purification plant ceded by the [[Netherlands]]. It consists of a scrubber tank, a treatment and sludge drying plant, as well as facilities and equipment for process control and monitoring, and a set of basic spare parts and fuel reserves.<ref name=carlini1/>

===LAJUB Laboratory===
The LAJUB laboratory (Laboratorio Atmosf<U+00E9>rico JUBany) of atmospheric sciences takes care of extraction and analysis of [[Carbon Dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Nitrogen Dioxide|NO<sub>2</sub>]] influencing the greenhouse effect, as well as other gases with varying degrees of climate impact.<ref name=carlini1/>

The LAJUB Laboratory has the following material provided by the IFA of Italy, as part of a cooperation agreement between the Argentine Antarctic Institute and ENEA-IFA: two [[Siemens]] Ultramat SE gas analyzers, two freezing chambers of {{convert|-80|C|abbr=on}} regime, three PC workstations, and an automatic gas flow controller and data acquisition system.<ref name=carlini1/>

In the summer campaign of 1998<U+2013>99 the software used by the lab was updated with new versions locally developed in [[Delphi language|Delphi]].<ref name=carlini1/>
