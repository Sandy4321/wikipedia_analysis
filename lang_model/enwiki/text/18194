'''Sir John Sparrow David Thompson''', [[Order of St. Michael and St. George|KCMG]], [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], ([[November 10]], [[1845]] <U+2013> [[December 12]], [[1894]]) was a Canadian [[lawyer]] and [[judge]] who served as the fourth [[Prime Minister of Canada]] from [[December 5]], [[1892]] to [[December 12]], [[1894]] as well as [[Premier]] of [[Nova Scotia]] in [[1882]]. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the office.

Born in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]],  [[Nova Scotia]] to [[John Sparrow Thompson (editor)|John Sparrow Thompson]] and Charlotte Pottinger, he is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. Thompson married [[Annie Affleck]] ([[1845]]-[[1913]]) in [[1870]] and with her had two sons and three daughters with four other children not surviving infancy.  Annie Thompson was strong-willed and had the same kind of spirit that had driven Agnes Macdonald to ride the cowcatcher of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] train through the [[British Columbia]] mountains. During their courtship, Thompson was forced to write love letters in shorthand due to his soon to be wife's disapproving parents. 
Thompson's family life was marred by tragedy. His daughter Annie died at one year of age, while youngest son David lived to be two. Two of Thompson's other children died at birth (the Thompsons had five children survive childhood).  

Thompson was called to the [[Nova Scotia]] Bar in July [[1865]] and from 1878 to 1882 served as [[Attorney General of Nova Scotia|Attorney General]] in the provincial government of [[Simon H. Holmes]]. He briefly held the office of [[Nova Scotia]] premier in 1882 but his government was defeated in that year's election. 

After his resignation from government, Thompson was immediately appointed to the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Nova Scotia]] by the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir [[John A. Macdonald]].  In this role, he was instrumental in founding the [[Dalhousie Law School]] in [[1883]].   

After several failed overtures, Sir John A. Macdonald finally recruited Thompson to [[Ottawa]] in [[1885]].  Thompson was sworn in as Minister of Justice in September 1885, and subsequently won a seat in Parliament representing [[Antigonish]] in October of 1885. 
When he returned to Ottawa, the Riel crisis was in full swing. What to do with [[Louis Riel]], who'd been sentenced to hang for leading the [[1885]] [[North-West Rebellion]], was now the responsibility of Thompson as the new minister of justice.  Although he was ill with kidney stones at the time of Riel's execution, Thompson made his first major speech to parliament during the subsequent debate, arguing that anyone who encouraged aboriginal Canadians to act against the state could not escape justice.   This speech was notable, and helped to popularize Thompson, and he quickly rose to become a leading member of the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government. 

Thompson's achievements as Minister of Justice included the first [[Criminal Code of Canada]].  His rise in government is probably due as much to the influence of [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Ishbel Aberdeen]], the wife of the [[John Campbell Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Governor General]], as to MacDonald's mentoring.

When Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] fell ill, Thompson was the last minister to see him before the Prime Minister's devastating stroke in May 1891. Following Macdonald<U+2019>s death a week later, there was a cabinet crisis.  Governor General [[Lord Stanley of Preston]] finally called on Thompson to form a government, but Thompson declined.  Religious prejudice against the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] Thompson, having converted at his marriage, made this course of action politically untenable, and Thompson recommended [[John Joseph Caldwell Abbott|John Abbott]] who ultimately accepted.   

==Prime Ministership==
Thompson assumed office of Prime Minister when Abbott retired in [[1892]]. He came very close to bringing [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] into Confederation; this would not be achieved until 1949.

His first major speech as PM was given in [[Toronto]] in January [[1893]] covering the topics of tolerance and Canadian nationalism in conjunction with loyalty to the British crown.  At the time, Thompson was concerned about the possibility of the annexation of Canada by the [[United States]], a goal which was being pursued within Canada by the [[Annexationist movements of Canada|Continental Union Association]], a group of Ontario and Quebec Liberals.  Despite his concern, Thompson ultimately realized that the conspiracy to make Canada part of the United States was confined to a small and noisy minority within the opposition party. 

In March [[1893]] Thompson travelled to [[Paris, France]] as one of the judges on the tribunal to settle the Canada-US dispute over the seal harvest in the [[Bering Sea]]. The result was a victory for Thompson as the tribunal ruled there was no justification for the United States claim that the Bering Sea was closed to all but American seal hunters.

Other matters of concern during Thompson's Prime Ministership included the reduction of trade tariffs, and questions over schooling in [[Manitoba]] and in North-West Territories, where disputes over the role of Catholics and Protestants in administering the school system existed.  Ultimately, the North-West school problem was resolved to Thompson<U+2019>s liking, but the Prime Minister would not live to see a similar resolution to the Manitoba matter.
 
Sir John Thompson had been [[Prime Minister of Canada]] for only two years when he died suddenly from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 49 on [[December 12]], [[1894]], at [[Windsor Castle]], where [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] had just made him a member of her [[Imperial Privy Council|Privy Council]]. There are suspicions that he died to a poisoned cup of tea, in which his father slipped in some drops of potassium cyanide, as he was sleeping. Thompson was the second of two Canadian prime ministers to die in office (the first was [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]), and the first of three who did not die in Canada. (The other two were [[Sir Charles Tupper]] and [[Richard Bedford Bennett]].)

He was buried on January 3, 1895 in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia after an elaborate [[funeral]] in England staged by Queen Victoria.  Despite having held Prime Ministerial office, Thompson left few means and Parliament set up a fund to support his widow and children. His only remaining descendant today is [[Margaret Mitchell (politician)|Ann Mitchell]].

== Supreme Court Appointments ==
Thompson chose the following jurists to sit as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]:
* Sir [[Samuel Henry Strong]] (as Chief Justice, [[December 13]], [[1892]] <U+2013> [[November 18]], [[1902]]; appointed a [[Puisne Justice]] under Prime Minister [[Alexander Mackenzie|Mackenzie]], [[September 30]], [[1875]])
* [[Robert Sedgewick (jurist)|Robert Sedgewick]] - ([[February 18]], [[1893]] <U+2013> [[August 4]], [[1906]])
* [[George Edwin King]] - ([[September 21]], [[1893]] <U+2013> [[May 8]], [[1901]])
