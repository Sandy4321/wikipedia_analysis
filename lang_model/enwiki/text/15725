The '''Daewoo Magnus''' is a [[mid-size]] [[sedan]] developed and manufactured by [[Daewoo Motors]] until its purchase by [[General Motors]], and now built for [[GM Daewoo|GM Daewoo Auto & Technology]] (GMDAT) by Daewoo Incheon Motor Company at its [[Bupyeong]] facility in [[South Korea]]. GM Daewoo and other GM divisions, as well as GMDAT stake holder Suzuki, have been marketing this car under different badges in various countries. The car is also known under its internal Daewoo designation of '''V200'''. The Project Manager was Dr. W.J Lee.

The V200 is a further development of the [[Daewoo Leganza]] (model V100), based on a stretched platform of that model. Launched in 2000, it was sold alongside the Leganza in Korea until the end of V100's production in 2002, when it also superseded it in export markets. The V200 itself has been given an extensive [[facelift (product)|facelift]] for 2006, which resulted in the model known as V250, or [[Daewoo Tosca]] in Korea. The V250 will completely supersede all versions of the V200 during 2006. 

The Evanda comes equipped with the Daewoo-developed ''XK6'' [[inline-6]] engine ([[DOHC]] [[multi-valve|24V]], {{Auto hp|155|0}} at 5800 rpm, {{Auto ft.lbf|177|0}} of torque at 4000 rpm - Canadian specification) or a [[Holden]]-built 2.0L [[GM Family II engine#E-TEC II|E-TEC II]] [[Inline-4]] ([[DOHC]] [[multi-valve|16V]]) carried over from the Leganza. [[ItalDesign]] of Italy was responsible for the styling and design of both the Leganza and Magnus. However, the upcoming V250 was styled in Korea by GM Daewoo.

== V200 in export markerts ==

The V200 was marketed as '''Daewoo Evanda''' in Western Europe, and '''Chevrolet Evanda''' in many Eastern European countries where GM did not use the Daewoo brand, as locally-manufactured versions of old Daewoo models were still sold under that marque.  The Evanda replaced the Leganza, and also the [[Chevrolet Alero]].  Later, in 2004, the entire Daewoo brand was replaced by Chevrolet in all Europe, with models renamed accordingly.

The Evanda was also [[badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] as the '''Suzuki Verona''' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and '''Chevrolet Epica''' in other markets including [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Arabia]]. However, [[Suzuki]] announced it would drop the Verona after the 2006 model year due to poor sales.<sup>[http://news.en.autos.sympatico.msn.ca/article.aspx?cp-documentid=576004]</sup>  

===Chevrolet Epica (Canada)===

Since 2004 (on which it sold alongside the Suzuki Verona), the Chevrolet Epica was sold in [[Canada]] in two trim levels, the LS and LT.  It replaced the [[Oldsmobile Alero]] since the [[Oldsmobile|marque's]] phaseout in 2004, as most Chevrolet dealerships sold Oldsmobiles.  For [[model year]] 2005, both versions feature the 2.5 [[liter]] [[inline-6]], driving the front wheels through an electronically controlled four speed automatic transmission. The car is positioned as an economical luxury entry, with the LS model equipped with 8 way power seat, 15 inch alloy wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, and CD player. The LT version adds traction control, ABS, and sunroof, all also optional for the LS model. Base price is $24,710 (Canadian) for the LS and $27,400 (Canadian) for the LT.  In price, it is [[Chevrolet]]'s top-of-the-line sedan in [[Canada]], priced between the Malibu and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], but slotted in size between the [[Chevrolet Cobalt|Cobalt]] and [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]].  Sales of the Epica have been slow in Canada, with the Impala and Malibu outselling those two models.  The Chevrolet Epica is also sold as such in [[Chile]].

The Chevrolet Epica is no longer sold in Canada as of September 2006. It is unclear whether or not Canada will get the redesigned 2007 Epica, which is based off Daewoo Tosca.

The Chevrolet Epica nameplate is now being utilized globally for the [[Daewoo Tosca]], the successor to the V200 Daewoo Magnus.

===Chevrolet Epica (United States Insular Areas)===
For a brief time the Chevrolet Epica was also available in the United States territories of [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and like the Canadian version it also carried the same features. Like the Epica in Canada, it too was withdrawn from the market.
