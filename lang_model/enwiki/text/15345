==History==

The village was founded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks, it was known as ''Siderli'' then. After a brief period of Bulgarian rule between 1913 and 1919, it became part of Greece. As a result its Bulgarian and Turkish population was exchanged with Greek refugees, mainly from today's Turkey.
