An ephemeral public statue of [[Edward Snowden]]{{mdash}}an American [[whistleblower]] who [[news leak|leaked]] [[classified information]] from the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and was charged with federal crimes as a result{{efn-ua|Snowden "leaked thousands of classified National Security Agency documents that exposed mass surveillance by the government" and was charged with violation of the [[Espionage Act]].

It was attached to the park's [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]], which honors the more than 11,500 American prisoners of war who died in the [[American Revolution]] while housed on British prison ships.<ref name="USAToday">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/06/edward-snowden-statue-illegally-placed-in-nyc-park/25371797/|title=Edward Snowden statue illegally placed in NYC park|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|first1=Yamiche |last1=Alcindor}}</ref><ref name="Mashable"/>  The work was officially called the '''''Prison Ship Martyrs Monument 2.0''''' by its creators.<ref name=ANYApr15>{{cite news |url=http://animalnewyork.com/2015/theres-a-massive-illicit-bust-of-edward-snowden-stuck-to-a-war-monument-in-brooklyn/|first1=Bucky |last1=Turco|title=There's a massive illicit bust of Edward Snowden stuck to a war monument in Brooklyn|publisher=Animal New York.com|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref>

Affixed atop an existing column, the bust of Edward Snowden was mounted by three anonymous artists and their helpers early in the morning of April 6, then covered and taken down by [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|NYC Parks]] officials later that day.<ref name=GuardApr15>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/06/edward-snowden-statue-bust-brooklyn-park-covered|first1=Alan |last1=Yuhas|title=Busted: Edward Snowden statue prompts cover-up at Brooklyn park|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> A [[hologram]] tribute to Snowden was subsequently installed after the statue was taken down.<ref name="NPR"/>

==Development and design==
The piece was conceived in 2014 by two artists from New York City and a sculptor from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The sculptor worked at less than market rates for his labour in creating the statue, with the piece eventually costing thousands of dollars to create over six months.<ref name=ANYApr15/>{{efn-ua|<U+201C>If it were bronze, it could be a $100,000 piece of artwork, maybe more.<U+201D><ref name=ANYApr15/>}} The artwork consisted of a {{convert|4|ft|m|sing=on}} high, {{Convert|100|lb|kg}} bust of Snowden on top of a [[Doric column]], with a [[Plexiglas]] stand with Snowden's name on it.<ref name="Yahoo">{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/photos/bust-of-edward-snowden-1428413495-slideshow/photo-provided-aymann-ismail-animalnewyork-monday-april-6-photo-001303800.html |title=Bust of Edward Snowden |publisher=[[Yahoo news]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> 

The piece was fused to [[Fort Greene Park]]'s [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]]<ref name=GuardApr15/> in the pre-dawn hours of April 6, 2015.<ref name="USAToday"/> The sculptor recommended that the two artists create a bust after they had suggested a life-size statue of Snowden. The bust was made from [[hydrocal]], a substance similar to plaster resembling bronze in appearance, which was then fixed to the pre-existing column with a non-damaging adhesive. The piece was designed so that it was similar to the style of other sculptures in the park.{{efn-ua|Both design and color "expertly match[ed]" the existing motif and sculptures "from its bronze patina finish to Snowden<U+2019>s hair<U+2014>which mimics the texture of the feather on the eagle."  The lettering for Snowden's name was "befitting of a monument."<ref name=ANYApr15/>}}

While it was very important to the artists that the piece be more than just a prop or [[papier-mache]] [[effigy]], they also wished not to damage the surface to which the bust would be bound. After some debate, they decided on an adhesive that would firmly hold the head in place, yet could be removed without marring the monument.<ref name=ANYApr15/> The statue had Snowden's name at its base, consistent with the names on the bases of other sculptures in the park.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Edward-Snowden-Statue-Bust-New-York-NY-Brooklyn-War-Monument-298782461.html | title=Giant Edward Snowden Sculpture Appears on War Monument in Brooklyn Park |publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=April 6, 2015 | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|We have updated this monument to highlight those who sacrifice their safety in the fight against modern-day tyrannies. It would be a dishonor to those memorialized here to not laud those who protect the ideals they fought for, as Edward Snowden has by bringing the NSA's [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|4th-Amendment]]-violating surveillance programs to light.

While anticipating the sculpture's probable demise,{{efn-ua|"The artists are fully aware of the bust's inevitable destruction and have left themselves a few options, including one that involves deploying an army of mini-Snowden heads.

==Aftermath==
Some characterized the placement of Snowden's statue as an act of vandalism, while others disagreed.{{efn-ua|<U+201C>'Vandalized?', some Fort Greene Focus readers asked, incredulously...  'Vandalized<U+2019> awesomely, you mean,' joked reader Jeremy Friedman. 'I think it's in the same vein as [[Banksy]]<U+2014>art not vandalism<U+2014>and [[Pussy Riot]], protesting against a government,' said Ed Goldman, a resident and member of Fort Greene Peace. 'It seems to me that great art was usually not sanctioned by stakeholders and not considered appropriate, either in content, style or placement.

Hours after the statue was removed, a group of New York artists calling themselves The Illuminator Art Collective<U+2014>unrelated to the three artists who created the statue<U+2014>used smoke and projection equipment to create an ephemeral [[hologram]] image of Snowden in place of the missing sculpture. This hologram had a white projection of the name "Snowden" at the bottom of one of the pillars, as well as a projection of Snowden's face over that pillar.<ref name="NPR"/> Collective artists said, "Our feeling is that while the State may remove any material artifacts that speak in defiance against incumbent authoritarianism, the acts of resistance remain in the public consciousness.
