'''''Galeus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[catshark]], [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scyliorhinidae]], commonly known as '''sawtail catsharks''' in reference to a distinctive saw-toothed crest of enlarged [[dermal denticle]]s found along the upper edges of their [[caudal fin]]s.<ref name="compagno1988"/> They are found in the [[Atlantic]], the western and central [[Pacific]], and the [[Gulf of California]], inhabiting deep water on or close to the bottom. Members of this genus are rather small, slim sharks with firm bodies and thick, rough skin. Their heads are usually fairly long and pointed, and have large mouths with well-developed furrows at the corners. They have large [[pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[anal fin]]s, and two similar [[dorsal fin]]s placed well back. Many species are ornately patterned with dark saddles and/or blotches. Sawtail catsharks feed on various [[invertebrate]]s and [[fish]]es, and may be either [[oviparous|egg-laying]] or [[aplacental viviparous|live-bearing]]. These harmless sharks are sometimes caught as [[bycatch]] but are of minimal commercial value.

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Pristiurus murinus by collett.jpg|thumb|left|The illustration that accompanied the 1904 description of the mouse catshark, as ''Pristurus murinus''.]]
''Galeus'', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''galeos'' meaning "shark", is one of the oldest [[Carcharhiniformes|carcharhiniform]] generic names. It was first used in a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] by [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in his 1810 ''Caratteri di alcuni nuovi generi e nuove specie di animali (principalmente di pesci) e piante della Sicilia: con varie osservazioni sopra i medesimi''.<ref>"Characters of various new genera and species of animals (mostly fishes) and plants, with various observations about them"</ref> Rafinesque listed ''G. melastomus'', ''G. vulpecula'' (=''[[Alopias vulpinus]]''), ''G. mustelus'' (=''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''), and ''G. catulus'' (=''[[Scyliorhinus canicula]]''). Subsequently, in 1816 [[Georges Cuvier]] used ''Galeus'' to refer to the genus presently known as ''[[Galeorhinus]]'', and in 1818 [[William Elford Leach]] used ''Galeus'' to refer to genus presently known as ''[[Mustelus]]''. As a result, 19th century authors generally used ''Galeus'' for the [[Triakidae|tope sharks]], and ''Pristiurus'', coined by [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte]] in 1834, for the sawtail catsharks.<ref name="compagno1988">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |year=1988 |title=Sharks of the Order Carcharhiniformes |publisher=Blackburn Press |pages=134&ndash;142 |isbn=1930665768}}</ref>

Rafinesque likely intended ''G. mustelus'' to be the [[type species]] for ''Galeus'', but of his listed species he furnished a description only for ''G. melastomus''. Therefore, in 1908 [[Henry Weed Fowler]] designated ''G. melastomus'' as the type species of ''Galeus'', establishing the genus to contain the sawtail catsharks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fowler, H.W. |year=1908 |title=Notes on sharks |journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia |volume=60 |pages=52&ndash;70}}</ref> ''Pristiurus'' became a [[junior synonym]], though it continued to appear in scientific literature for some time after. Fowler's definition of ''Galeus'' gained widespread acceptance after [[Henry Bryant Bigelow]] and [[William Charles Schroeder]]'s 1948 taxonomic review.<ref name="compagno1988"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bigelow, H.W. and W.C. Schroeder |title=Sharks |journal=Memoirs of the Sears Foundation of Marine Research |volume=1 |pages=53&ndash;576}}</ref> In 1952, Philip Orkin advocated that ''Pristiurus'' take precedence over ''Galeus'', based on [[David Starr Jordan]] and [[Barton Warren Evermann]]'s (possibly questionable) designation of ''G. mustelus'' as a type species for ''Galeus'' in 1896.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Orkin, P.A. |title=''Galeus'' Rafinesque, 1810 (Chondrichthyes, Triakidae), an invalid generic name |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |date=December 1952 |volume=5 |issue=60 |page=1112}}</ref> [[Leonard Compagno]] and most other recent authors have not upheld his proposal, in the interests of taxonomic stability.<ref name="compagno1988"/>

==Phylogeny and evolution==

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Catshark oedv2.jpg|thumb|left|A roughtail catshark (''G. arae'') in its natural habitat; members of this genus occur close to the bottom in deep water.]]
The centers of [[biodiversity]] for ''Galeus'' are the [[North Atlantic]] (8 species) and the northwestern [[Pacific]] (4 species). A few outlying species are found in the South Atlantic (''G. mincaronei'' and ''G. polli''), [[Oceania]] (''G. gracilis'' and ''G. priapus''), and the [[Gulf of California]] (''G. piperatus''). In the western  [[Indian Ocean]], this genus appears to be replaced by the ecologically similar genus ''[[Holohalaelurus]]''.<ref name="compagno1988"/><ref name="compagno et al">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V., M.

==Description==
Sawtail catsharks reach maximum lengths of between {{convert|25|and|90|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They have slender, firm bodies and narrow, slightly flattened heads with short to long, pointed snouts. The nostrils are divided into incurrent and excurrent openings by triangular flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The horizontally oval eyes are placed mostly on the sides of the head and equipped with rudimentary [[nictitating membrane]]s (protective third eyelids); below each eye is a subtle ridge, and behind is a small [[spiracle]] (auxiliary [[aquatic respiration|respiratory]] opening). The mouth is rather large and wide, and when closed the upper teeth are exposed. There are short to long furrows around the corners of the jaws. The teeth are small and number 47&ndash;78 rows in the upper jaw and 48&ndash;82 rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a narrow central cusp flanked by one or more smaller cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of [[gill slit]]s.<ref name="compagno1988"/><ref name="compagno"/>

[[Image:Galeus cadenati crest by springer.png|thumb|Close-up from above of the caudal fin denticle crest of the longfin sawtail catshark (''G. cadenati''); such crests are shared by all ''Galeus'' species.]]
The two [[dorsal fin]]s are nearly equal in size and shape, and are placed well back on the body, behind the origins of the [[pelvic fin]]s. The [[pectoral fin]]s are fairly large and broad, with angular to rounded corners. The pelvic fins are much smaller, and bear [[claspers]] in males; in ''G. murinus'' and ''[[Galeus nipponensis|G. nipponensis]]'', the pelvic fin inner margins are partially fused to form an "apron" over the base of the claspers. The [[anal fin]] is elongated and much larger than the pelvic and dorsal fins; its position relative to the pelvic and [[caudal fin]]s varies from very close to well-spaced. The [[caudal peduncle]] can be nearly cylindrical to laterally compressed, depending on species. The caudal fin comprises more or less a quarter of the total length, and is low with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe.<ref name="compagno1988"/><ref name="compagno"/><ref name="nakaya">{{cite journal |author=Nakaya, K. |year=1975 |title=Taxonomy, comparative anatomy and phylogeny of Japanese catsharks, Scyliorhinidae |journal=Memoirs of the Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University |volume=23 |pages=1&ndash;94}}</ref>

The skin is thick and densely covered by small, overlapping, well-[[calcification|calcified]] [[dermal denticle]]s; each denticle has a leaf-shaped crown with a horizontal ridge and three teeth on the posterior margin. There is a prominent, saw-like crest of enlarged denticles along the dorsal margin of the caudal fin. ''G. murinus'' and ''[[Galeus springeri|G. springeri]]'' also have a similar crest along the ventral margin of the caudal fin. ''Galeus'' species are typically grayish or brownish above and lighter below, and most have a pattern of darker saddles and/or blotches along the back and tail. The interior of the mouth may be light or dark.<ref name="compagno1988"/><ref name="compagno"/><ref name="konstantinou and cozzi">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1447711 |author=Konstantinou, H. and J.R.

==Biology and ecology==
Natural history data is scant for most ''Galeus'' species. They feed on various types of [[invertebrate]]s and [[fish]]es on or near the bottom.<ref name="compagno et al"/> In [[Suruga Bay]], the dietary compositions of ''G. eastmani'' and juvenile ''G. nipponensis'' differ significantly, suggesting there is reduced [[interspecific competition]] between co-occurring ''Galeus'' species.<ref name="horie and tanaka">{{cite journal |author=Horie, T. and S.

Among the oviparous species, most (e.g. ''G. murinus'', ''G. nipponensis'') exhibit single oviparity, in which only a single egg matures within each of the female's [[oviduct]]s at a time. In contrast, a few species such as ''G. atlanticus'' and ''G. melastomus'' exhibit multiple oviparity, in which several eggs can mature within each oviduct simultaneously. Single oviparity is considered to be the [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] condition, while multiple oviparity and aplacental viviparity are thought to be more [[derived]].<ref name="iglesias et al2002">{{cite journal |author=Igl<U+00E9>sias, S.P., M.H. du Buit, and K.

==Human interactions==
Sawtail catsharks pose no danger to humans and have little economic value, though varying numbers are [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by deepwater [[commercial fisheries]]. Some of the larger species, such as ''G. melastomus'' and ''G. polli'', are occasionally utilized for meat, [[fishmeal]], and/or [[leather]].<ref name="compagno"/> The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed ''G. atlanticus'' and ''[[Galeus mincaronei|G. mincaronei]]'', both of which have very restricted distributions, as [[Near Threatened]] and [[Vulnerable]] respectively.<ref>{{IUCN2010 |assessors=Coelho, R., J.
