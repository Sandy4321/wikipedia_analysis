'''Dick Morley''' is known as the "father" of the PLC since he was involved with the production of the first [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) for [[General Motors Corporation|GM]], the Modicon, at Bedford and Associates in [[1968]]. The Modicon brand of PLC is now owned by [[Schneider Electric]]. Dick stayed involved with the technology through 1998. The PLC was a significant advancement in the practice of [[automation]], since it was a ruggedized computer that was programmed in [[ladder logic]], familiar to industrial settings.  PLCs execute their programs in a fixed cycle time and are more reliable than a [[general purpose computer]].

Morley also made significant contributions to the fields of flight training simulators and building automation.
