The '''Eastern Range mine''' is an [[iron ore]] mine located in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]], 10 kilometres south-east of [[Paraburdoo, Western Australia|Paraburdoo]].<ref>[http://minedexext.doir.wa.gov.au/minedex/external/common/appMain.jsp MINEDEX website: Eastern Range search result] accessed: 6 November 2010</ref>

The mine is partly-owned and operated by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Iron Ore]] and is one of twelve iron ore mines the company operates in the Pilbara.<ref name="Pilbara" >[http://www.riotintoironore.com/ENG/operations/301_pilbara.asp Pilbara] Rio Tinto Iron Ore website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref><ref name="Mining" >[http://www.riotintoironore.com/ENG/operations/497_mining.asp Mining] Rio Tinto Iron Ore website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref> In the calendar year 2009, the combined Pilbara operations produced 202 million tonnes of iron ore, a 15 percent increase from 2008.<ref>[http://www.riotintoironore.com/documents/AJM_23_Mar_2010_FINAL.pdf Preparing for the future] Rio Tinto presentation, published: 23 March 2010, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref> The Pilbara operations accounted for almost 13 percent of the world's 2009 iron ore production of 1.59 billion tonnes.<ref>[http://www.miningweekly.com/article/iron-ore-production-falls-62-in-2009---unctad-report-2010-07-30 Global iron-ore production falls 6,2% in 2009 - Unctad report] miningweekly.com, published: 30 July 2010, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.unctad.org/templates/webflyer.asp?docid=13721&intItemID=1634&lang=1 Production of iron ore fell in 2009, but shipments continued to increase, report says] [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]] website, published: 30 July 2010, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref>

==Overview==
[[File:Iron ore Pilbara.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Iron ore mines in the [[Pilbara]] region.]]
Rio Tinto iron ore operations in the Pilbara began in 1966.<ref name="Pilbara" /> The mine itself began operations in 2004. The combined production capacity of the [[Paraburdoo mine|Paraburdoo]], Eastern Range and [[Channar mine]]s is 20 million tonnes of iron ore. The ore is processed both at Eastern Range and at Paraburdoo before being loaded onto rail, being transported from Eastern Range to Paraburdoo by conveyor belt.<ref name="Mine" >[http://www.riotintoironore.com/ENG/operations/501_eastern_range.asp Eastern Range mine] Rio Tinto Iron Ore website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref>

Ore from the mine is then transported to the coast through the [[Hamersley & Robe River railway]], where it is loaded onto ships.<ref name="Rail" >[http://www.riotintoironore.com/ENG/operations/497_rail.asp Rail] Rio Tinto Iron Ore website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref> Ore from Eastern Range, like [[Brockman mine|Brockman]], [[Mount Tom Price mine|Mount Tom Price]], [[Paraburdoo mine|Paraburdoo]], [[Channar mine|Channar]], [[Marandoo mine|Marandoo]] and [[Yandicoogina mine|Yandicoogina]] are transported as lump and fines ore product from the mines to Dampier via rail. Before being loaded onto ships for export, the product is blended and rescreened. The maximum size for the lumps is 31.5&nbsp;mm, while the fines are at a maximum of 6.3&nbsp;mm.<ref>[http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/education/fact_sheets/iron.jsp Iron fact sheet - Mining] [[Geoscience Australia]] website, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref>

The mines workforce lives residential in Paraburdoo.<ref name="Mine" /> In the calendar year 2009, the combined operations of Paraburdoo, Channar and Eastern Range employed 1,081 people, a decrease in comparison to 2008, when it employed 1,324.<ref name="Digest" />

The mine is jointly owned by Rio Tinto, who holds 54% and Chinese company [[Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation]], who owns the remaining 46%.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/china-in-box-seat-on-a-bhp-rio-deal/story-e6frg9df-1111114836462 China in box seat on a BHP, Rio deal] ''[[The Australian]]'', published: 9 November 2007, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref> Shanghai Baosteel acquired its share in the mine in April 2004 in order to secure a long-term, stable supply of resources for the Chinese economy.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/27/content_326730.htm Steel mills dig in overseas] ''[[China Daily]]'', published: 27 April 2004, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref> Rio Tinto's share of the mine is owned through Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary, which ownes six mines in the Pilbara, and partly owns two more mines in the region, including Eastern Range.<ref name="Digest" >[http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/Western_Australian_Mineral_and_Petroleum_Statistic_Digest_2009.pdf Western Australian Mineral and Petroleum Statistic Digest 2009] [[Department of Mines and Petroleum]] website, accessed: 8 November 2010</ref>

While the Eastern Range deposit was known for two decades, it took China's emergence as a major steel producer and oversees investor to develop the mine.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43765-2004May20?language=printer Booming China Devouring Raw Materials] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', published: 21 May 2004, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref>
