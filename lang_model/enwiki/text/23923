'''''Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures''''' (also known as '''''Tiny Toon Adventures''''' or '''''Tiny Toons''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] created and produced as a collaborative effort between [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].

Warner Bros. had reinstated its animation studio in 1980 after a decade of dormancy. But during the '80s, the new studio only worked on revivals of the classic characters. Tiny Toons was the first of many original animated series from the studio. A major precedent for the series was the success of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', which featured appearances by many of its famous cartoon characters, and which had been co-produced by Spielberg's company [[Amblin Entertainment]] (producer of many famous family movies, including ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'') .  
==Background==
===Premise===
''Tiny Toon Adventures'' had been set in the fictional city of Acme Acres, where most of the ''Tiny Toons'' and ''Looney Tunes'' characters lived.  Most of ''Tiny Toon Adventures''' characters attended Acme Looniversity, a [[high school]]/[[college|university]] whose faculty primarily consisted of the mainstays of the classic Warner cartoons. In the series, the university was founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny, with graduates receiving a "[[Diploma]] of [[Lunacy]]", giving them the opportunity to become full-time cartoon characters. [[Bugs Bunny]] taught the "Outsmarting Antagonists" class, [[Yosemite Sam]] taught both "Firearms" and "Anvilology" (the study of falling [[anvil]]s for comic effect), and [[Elmer Fudd]] taught "Booby Traps". The principal of the Acme Looniversity was a giant floating head like the one in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 movie)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', voiced by Noel Blanc (son of [[Mel Blanc]]); the principal was later revealed to be Bugs Bunny in disguise. [[Wile E. Coyote]] was the [[dean (education)|dean]] at the Looniversity's School of Hard Knocks.

===Characters===
The series revolved around a group of young cartoon characters learning at [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] Looniversity to be the next generation of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes stars by exhibiting similar traits and looks. 

Major characters included:
*[[Babs and Buster Bunny|Buster Bunny]], a blue toon rabbit modeled after [[Bugs Bunny]].
*[[Babs and Buster Bunny|Babs Bunny]], a pink toon rabbit similar in design to Buster.  Buster's partner-in-mischief and sometimes-girlfriend.
*[[Plucky Duck]], an egotistical green toon duck modeled after [[Daffy Duck]].
*[[Hamton J. Pig]], a cleanliness-obsessed toon pig molded in the image of [[Porky Pig]].
*[[Furrball]], a light-blue kitten version of [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]].
*[[Sweetie Pie]], a pink [[Tweety Bird]]-like girl.
*[[Fifi Le Fume|Fifi La Fume]], a young purple-and-white skunk girl, modeled after [[Pep<U+00E9> Le Pew]] (including the faux french accent).
*[[Shirley the Loon]], a spiritual New Age waterbird with a [[Valley Girl]] accent; possibly modeled after or inspired by [[Melissa Duck]]. Also a reference to [[Shirley MacLaine]]
*[[Calamity Coyote]], a young [[Wile E. Coyote]]-in-training.
*[[Little Beeper]], modeled after [[Road Runner cartoons|Road Runner]].
*[[Dizzy Devil]], a junior [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]].
*[[Montana Max]], a bad-tempered money-hungry tycoon, best described as sort of a cross between [[Yosemite Sam]] and [[Ducktales]]' [[Flintheart Glomgold]].  
*[[Elmyra Duff]], a clueless redheaded girl modeled (very loosely) after [[Elmer Fudd]].

The original inspiration for two of the characters was somewhat obscure compared to the others: [[Li'l Sneezer]] was a revival of [[Sniffles]] the mouse, and [[Gogo Dodo]] was based on the original Dodo from ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]'', a theatrical ''Looney Tunes'' release directed by [[Bob Clampett]] in 1938.  In fact, Gogo is the only Acme Looniversity alumnus (or at least, the only one in the on-screen cast) who is a direct descendant of a classic [[Looney Tunes]] character.  (While a great deal of Tiny Toons fan-fiction suggests other relationships between the Classic and Tiny Toons characters -- sons, nieces, nephews, grandkids, etc. -- no such relationships have ever been stated in the actual cartoons.)

In some ways, both Buster ''and'' Babs Bunny can be said to be modeled after Bugs Bunny, with each having taken on different aspects of the original character's personality.  Buster, for example, normally shares Bugs' coolness under fire and laid-back attitude until provoked; Babs, on the other hand, displays more of Bugs' earlier, "wackier" personality, along with his flair for confounding enemies (and friends) with quick costume changes and impersonations.  That being said, it's generally accepted that Babs is essentially an original character, created specifically as a counterpart for Buster in keeping with what was then a general trend in animation towards having more and/or stronger female characters in kids' TV shows, rather than being specifically based on any particular member of the Looney Tunes cast.  (Some have suggested that she may be based on or related to [[Lola Bunny]], but this is obviously impossible since the latter character did not exist until the movie [[Space Jam]] appeared in 1996, long after ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' had aired.)

Other minor characters based on classic characters were:
*[[Barky Marky]], a dog based on [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Marc Antony]] from several [[Chuck Jones]]-directed short subjects. 
*[[Concord Condor]], modeled after [[Beaky Buzzard]].
*[[Fowlmouth]], loosely modeled after [[Foghorn Leghorn]].
*[[Marcia the Martian]], the niece of [[Marvin the Martian]], appeared in a single episode, lampooning the original [[Duck Dodgers]] cartoons.  While Daffy Duck (as Duck Dodgers) and Marvin attempt to convince Marcia and Plucky to take part in their age-old feud, the proteg<U+00E9>s decide it's more fun to play with each other. 
*[[Witch Sandy]], a witch who is based on [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]]; she had a one-time appearance on the show in a parody of Hansel and Gretel. She lived in a house made out of carrot cake and drew the attention of Buster and Babs. She tried to use the two in a recipe like Hazel, turning Babs into a real [[rabbit]] and summoning her cutlery to try and kill Buster. But she got turned into a [[goldfish]]. Sandy wears a cute disguise but she is actually as ugly as Hazel.
*[[Byron Basset]], the sleeping puppy, is based on [[Sam Sheepdog]]. He appeared very briefly in a few episodes and in the movie as well.
*[[Arnold the Pit Bull|Arnold]], the pit bull, is modeled after [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].
*[[Bookworm]], is based on the bookworm companion of [[Sniffles]]. Since he is the Looniversity's librarian he could be the very same character, despite design changes similar to [[Bosko|Bosko and Honey]].
*[[Tyrone Turtle]] is based on [[Cecil Tortoise]] and was voiced by [[Edan Gross]].

Minor original characters included a family of Italians fleas who lived on Furrball based on the animated movie [[An American Tail]], a trio of singing girl roaches (modelled after and voiced by [[The Roches]]), [[Byron Basset]], and the two Ralphs. One was [[Ralph the Guard|a fat security guard]] who later migrated to ''[[Animaniacs]]'', while the other was a slobbish [[Ralph Bakshi]] [[caricature]]. 

Guest stars included [[Henny Youngman]] as a chicken version of himself; [[Edie McClurg]] as Hamton's mother; [[Julie Brown]] as Julie Bruin; and [[the Roches]] as cockroach versions of themselves.

==Production==
===Production History===
Tiny Toons originated as an idea by [[Terry Semel]], then president of Warner Bros.  Wishing to capitalize on the success of [[Television program|TV shows]] featuring [[Child versions of cartoon characters|younger versions of famous characters]] (such as ''[[Ultraman Kids]]'', ''[[Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Flintstones Kids]]''), Semel proposed a similar show based on ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', where the characters were young versions of the original ''Looney Tunes'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters.  A similar idea would have introduced the new characters as the offspring of the original characters.  [http://jedaniels-adventures.blogspot.com/2006/05/what-should-be-released-on-dvd.html|1]

The studio approached Steven Spielberg in 1987 to collaborate on Semel's ideas.  Spielberg suggested that the new characters be spiritual, not literal, descendants of the ''Looney Tunes'', and that the original characters make appearances as their mentors.  This idea became the basis for ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', which at first was to become a [[theatrical]] [[feature-length film]], but was later changed to a [[television series]] format in December of [[1988]]. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318258,00.html|1]  Warners Bros. Animation v.p. Jean MacCurdy hired animator/producer/writer [[Tom Ruegger]] away from Hanna-Barbera to lead the development and creation of the new series.  

===Writers===
The series and the show's characters were developed by series producer and head writer [[Tom Ruegger]], division leader Jean MacCurdy, and story editors Wayne Kaatz, [[Paul Dini]], and [[Sherri Stoner]]. Among the first writers on the series were [[Jim Reardon]], [[Tom Minton]], and Eddie Fitzgerald.  The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, [[Ken Boyer (animator)|Ken Boyer]], [[Dan Haskett]], Karen Haskett, [[Jeff Pidgeon]], and many other artists and directors.

During production of the series' third season, [[Charles Adler (voice actor)|Charlie Adler]], the voice of [[Buster Bunny]], left the show due to a conflict with the producers; Adler was upset that he hadn't landed a role in the new show ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (the follow-up to ''Tiny Toons''). Additionally, he took offense to the fact that small-role voice actors like [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], and [[Frank Welker]] were given starring roles in ''[[Animaniacs]]''.<ref name="kennedy"/>  Adler was replaced by [[John Kassir]] for the remainder of the show's run.  [[Joe Alaskey]], the voice of [[Plucky Duck]], also left ''Tiny Toons'' for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.<ref name="kennedy"/>

===Animation===
In order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, Warner and Amblin contracted several different animation houses to share the workload (now a common practice in modern television animation studios).  These animation studios included [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]], [[Wang Film Productions]], [[AKOM]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], [[Encore Cartoons]], [[StarToons]], and [[Kennedy Cartoons]].  [[Kennedy Cartoons]] left the project while working on the 37th episode of production, which became the pilot episode, "[[The Looney Beginning (Tiny Toons episode)|The Looney Beginning]]".<ref name="kennedy">{{cite web| url=http://platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html| title=Platypus Comix interviews......Tom Ruegger!

==Hallmarks==
===Credit gag===
[[Image:TV tiny toons logo with buster bunny.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Buster Bunny]] saying one version of the many closing words that would appear at the end of the closing credits to ''Tiny Toons Adventures'' episodes.]]

At the end of an episode, the credits at the end of the show always closed with one or more characters appearing in the [[Warner Bros.#Logo|Warner Bros. rings]] and saying a closing line.  Among these lines were:
*'''[[Buster Bunny]]:''' "Say good night, Babs."<br>'''[[Babs Bunny]]:''' "Good night, Babs!"<br>''(This is an homage to [[Burns and Allen|The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]].)'' 
*'''[[Babs and Buster Bunny]]''': ''{simultaneously}'' "Alooooooo-ha!" 
*'''[[Buster Bunny]]''': "And that's a wrap!"
*'''[[Plucky Duck]]''': "Parting is such sweet sorrow!"
*'''[[Fifi Le Fume]]''': "Au revoir, mon petite ''potato'' du ''couch!''" (French for: Good-bye my little [[couch potato]].)
*'''[[Byron Basset]]''': "Woof!"
*'''[[Gogo Dodo]]''': "It's been surreal!" (before pulling out a remote control and hitting a button, turning off the show, this was complete with an iris out effect)
*'''[[Elmyra Duff]]''': "Let the show begin!"
*'''[[Dizzy Devil]]''': "Show over!" ''{spins around devouring the logo}''
*'''[[Furrball]]''': "RRRROOOOOOOOAAAAAAARRRRR! Meow!" (Homage to the famous MGM lion opening sequence)


In addition, a humorous message would appear among the credits shortly before the closing quote.  This running gag would turn up in the later shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', ''[[Freakazoid!]]'', and ''[[Histeria!]]''

=== Humor ===
The show often contained "gross out" humor dealing with bodily functions as well as political and entertainment satire. Caricature versions of celebrities made frequent appearances, though were almost always voiced by imitators, and often appeared under [[parody]] names ("Tom Snooze" instead of [[Tom Cruise]], "Michael Molten-Lava"/[[Michael Bolton]], etc).  The show also parodied other [[television|TV]] shows and cartoons of the day, including ''[[The Simpsons]]''. A recurring parody was that of the Immature Radioactive [[Samurai]] Slugs, which poked fun at the popular cartoon ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 cartoon)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. Both tactics would later be copied by the show's successor, [[Animaniacs]].

Critics of the series considered the ''Tiny Toons'' characters to be little more than knock-offs of the original [[Termite Terrace]] creations.<ref name= "johnk">{{Citation| last = Kricfalusi| first =John | author-link =John K| magazine = Animation Magazine| year =1994 | date =May/June 1994|url=}}</ref>

== Films and television specials ==
One feature-length ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' [[film|movie]] was released [[direct-to-video]] in 1991, entitled ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''.<ref name= "vacation"> Lenburg, p. 336.  Accesed on [[2007-06-27]]</ref>  Other features released for ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' include ''Spring Break Special'', ''It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special'', and ''Night Ghoulery''.  ''Spring Break Special'' was shown on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] during primetime on [[March 27]], [[1994]].  ''Christmas Special'' aired on [[December 6]], [[1992]].

== Spin-offs ==

Two episodes of ''Tiny Toons'' <U+2014> "Take Elmyra Please" and "Grandma's Dead" <U+2014> seem to have been intended as [[television pilot|pilots]] for a spin-off starring Elmyra. In these episodes, Elmyra and her family live in a human community (no [[anthropomorphic]] animals), and she goes to [[Harvey Korman]] Elementary School instead of Acme Looniversity. [[Furrball]] is present as her pet cat, but he shows no signs of anthropomorphism. Whether these episodes were pilots or not, no spin-off show materialized.

{{main|The Plucky Duck Show}}

In 1992, ''[[The Plucky Duck Show]]'' was produced as a spin-off of ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' that starred [[Plucky Duck]].  Except for the premiere (''[[The Return of Batduck]]''), the show was entirely made up of recycled Plucky-centric episodes from the ''Tiny Toons''.<ref name ="spinoff1">{{cite web | title = Trivia for "The Plucky Duck Show"| publisher = The Internet Movie Database | url = http://imdb.com/title/tt0103513/trivia| accessdate = 2007-06-02}}</ref>  After one thirteen-episode season, the show was canceled.

{{main|Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain}}

In 1998, another spin-off was produced, ''[[Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain]]''.  This short-lived series starred [[Elmyra Duff|Elmyra]] alongside ''[[Animaniacs]]'' stars [[Pinky and the Brain]].  The series was a significant re-tooling of the 1995 spin-off ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' which contradicted several elements of Elmyra's life on ''Tiny Toons''; in the series, Elmyra had not attended Acme Looniversity or come in contact with any of the ''Tiny Toons'' cast.  This series was also canceled after thirteen episodes.

==Merchandise==
===Print===

Among the same time that ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' premiered, a quarterly children's magazine based on the series was published for five issues. Also, various storybooks were published by the [[Little Golden Book]] company, including a few episode adaptations and some original stories (''Lost in the Fun House'' and ''Happy Birthday, Babs!'').

Interestingly, ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' did not spin off its own comic book. However, the characters did make occasional cameo appearances in the ''Animaniacs'' and ''Pinky and the Brain'' comic books. Also, Buster makes a cameo as a mounted head on [[Elmer Fudd]]'s wall in issue #75 of the ''Looney Tunes'' comic book.

===Video games===
{{main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures video games}}
Since its debut, numerous [[video games]] based on ''Tiny Toons'' have been released.  Many companies have held the development and publishing rights for the games, including [[Konami]] (during the 90s), [[Atari]], [[NewKidCo]], [[Conspiracy Games]], [[Warthog Games Limited|Warthog]], [[Terraglyph Interactive Studios]], and [[Treasure Co. Ltd|Treasure]].

===VHS===
In the early 90s, Warner Bros. had released several Tiny Toons videos:

*''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''
*''Best of Buster and Babs''
*''Two Tone Town''
*''Tiny Toon Big Adventures''
*''Tiny Toon Island Adventures''
*''Tiny Toon Fiendishly Funny Adventures''

===DVD===
Currently, no DVD set for ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' has yet been officially announced, but Warner Home Video said in a chat on Home Theatre Forum that the show would be released to DVD "hopefully in 2008".<ref name="dvd">{{cite web|url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=7285|title=Info From The Warner TV-DVD Chat at the Home Theater Forum: What's Coming?

==Media information==
===Broadcast History===
{{main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}
''Tiny Toon Adventures'' along with ''Animaniacs'' reran in syndication through the 1990s into the early-2000s. In 2005, it was removed from the [[NickToons Network]] and is not currently airing on [[United States]] [[television]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], however, it was airing on [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] until May, 2007. The series is scheduled to re-run on [[Warner Bros.]] and [[AOL]]'s new broadband internet channel ''[[Toontopia TV]]''.

==="Banned" episodes===
The episode "Elephant Issues" (an educational episode meant to address the issue of [[peer pressure]]) was banned from [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] and [[Cartoon Network]] because of the episode's final short, "One Beer," which depicted Buster, Plucky, and Hamton drinking [[beer]]. Although the short was intended to illustrate the dangers of [[drinking]], the networks believed that it delivered the wrong message to the show's primary audience, predominantly young children; according to them, the object lesson was delivered in such an exaggeratedly heavy-handed manner as to be downright sarcastic.[http://www.platypuscomix.net/onlyme/elephantissues.html|1] Another episode, "Toons from the Crypt" (a parody of the [[Horror fiction|Horror]] [[comic book]] and TV series, [[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]), was never shown on FOX stations during the initial run of the series, and instead premiered on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in 1995.<ref name="crypt">{{citeweb|url =http://www.toonzone.net/shows/episodes/tinytoons.html |title=''Tiny Toon Adventures'' episodes|work=Toon Zone|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> One segment, "Wait 'til your Father gets Even", was aired as part of The Plucky Duck Show, and another, "Night of the Living Pets", was released to home video.
