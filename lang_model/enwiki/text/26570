== History ==

The company was founded as '''Chuit & Naef''' in 1895 in [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]), by chemist Philippe Chuit and businessman Martin Naef. Fred Firmenich joined in 1900 and later became the majority partner. The company was eventually renamed '''Firmenich SA'''. Its current [[CEO]] is [[Patrick Firmenich]].

Originally a fragrance company, Firmenich first branched into the flavor business by creating a [[raspberry]] substitute in 1938, followed by creations of [[citrus]] and [[strawberry]] flavors. Multiple other flavors followed in the booming field of flavor synthesis, spurred by the developing trend of companies worldwide selling [[processed food]]s and [[preserved food]]s. Since then, Firmenich has become a world leader in the creation and sales of natural and artificial food flavors.<ref>[http://www.leffingwell.com/top_10.htm 2005 - 2009 Flavor & Fragrance Industry Leaders]</ref>
