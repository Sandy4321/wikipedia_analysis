'''''Soryu''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Ky<U+016B>jitai]]: <U+84BC><U+9F8D>, [[Shinjitai]]: <U+84BC><U+7ADC>, ''soryu'', meaning "blue (or green) dragon") was an [[aircraft carrier]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. She took part in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and was sunk at the [[battle of Midway]].<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-fornv/japan/japsh-s/soryu.htm Soryu @] www.history.navy.mil</ref>

''Soryu'' was built at Kaigun Kosho, [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], [[Japan]] and commissioned on [[December 29]], [[1937]]. As opposed to some earlier Japanese carriers which were redesigns on cruiser hulls, she was designed from the start as an aircraft carrier. At close to 35&nbsp;knots, she was the fastest carrier in the world at launch.

At the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], commanded by Captain [[Ryusaku Yanagimoto]], ''Soryu'' was one of six carriers making up the ''[[Kido Butai]]'' (Striking Force) that [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on [[7 December]] [[1941]]. She launched two waves of air strikes against the US Naval base. Her first wave targeted [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|''Nevada'']], [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|''Tennessee'']], and [[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|''West Virginia'']] with armour-piercing bombs and [[USS Utah (BB-31)|''Utah'']], [[USS Helena (CL-50)|''Helena'']], [[USS California (BB-44)|''California'']], and [[USS Raleigh (CL-7)|''Raleigh'']] with torpedoes, as well as attacked grounded aircraft at Barbers Point. Her second wave targeted ''California'', ''Raleigh'', [[Kaneohe]] and Navy Yard installations.

==Combat history==

From [[21 December]] to [[23 December]] [[1941]] ''Soryu'' launched air strikes against [[Wake Island]]. In January of 1942 she supported the invasion of the [[Palau Islands]] and the [[Battle of Ambon]]. On [[19 February]] [[1942]] ''Soryu'' launched [[Air raids on Darwin, February 19, 1942|air strikes]] against [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin, Australia]]. In March 1942 she took part in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]], helping sink the US tanker [[USS Pecos (AO-6)|''Pecos'']].

In April of 1942 ''Soryu'' took part in the [[Indian Ocean raid]], launching air strikes against the [[Royal Navy]] base at [[Ceylon]] on [[5 April]] [[1942]], and helping to sink the Royal Navy cruisers [[HMS Cornwall (56)|''Cornwall'']] and [[HMS Dorsetshire (40)|''Dorsetshire'']]. On [[9 April]] she helped sink the British carrier [[HMS Hermes (D95)|''Hermes'']] and the escorting Australian destroyer [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMAS ''Vampire'']].

On [[19 April]] [[1942]] she pursued the American carriers [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']] and [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']] after they launched the [[Doolittle Raid]], but without success.

In June of 1942 ''Soryu'' was one of four carriers with Vice Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s First Carrier Striking Force in the [[battle of Midway]]. Her aircraft complement consisted of 21 [[Mitsubishi A6M]] "Zero" fighters, 21 [[Aichi D3A]] "Val" dive bombers, and 21 [[Nakajima B5N]] "Kate" torpedo bombers. [http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-6.htm] On [[4 June]] [[1942]] she launched one wave of planes against the American base on [[Midway Island]]. At 10:25 while preparing to launch a second strike against an American carrier group, she was attacked by thirteen [[SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers from the American carrier [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']]. ''Soryu'' received three direct hits from 1000-lb (454kg) bombs: one penetrated to the lower hangar deck, and the other two exploded in the upper hangar deck. The hangars contained armed and fueled planes in preparation for the upcoming strike, resulting in secondary explosions. Within a very short time the fires on the ship were out of control. At 10:40 she stopped and her crew were taken off by the destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Isokaze|''Isokaze'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Hamakaze|''Hamakaze'']]. ''Soryu'' sank at 7:13 PM. Losses were 711 crew of her nominal complement of 1103, including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board. This was the highest mortality percentage of all the Japanese carriers lost at Midway, due largely to the devastation in both hangar decks.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-fornv/japan/japsh-s/soryu.htm Soryu @] www.history.navy.mil</ref>

The official record (the Nagumo Report) implies that ''Soryu'' sank of her own accord, but later research has revealed she was scuttled with torpedoes by ''[[Japanese destroyer Isokaze|Isokaze]]''.

==Pop Culture references==
[[Asuka Langley Soryu]] from the animated series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' is named for this aircraft carrier, as well as the American aircraft carrier [[USS Langley (CV-1)]].
