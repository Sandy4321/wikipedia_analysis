'''''Persoonia linearis''''', commonly known as the '''narrow-leaved geebung''', is a [[shrub]] native to [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in eastern Australia. It reaches 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft), or occasionally 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft), in height and has thick, dark grey papery bark. The leaves are, as the species name suggests, more or less linear in shape, and are up to 9&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;in) long, and 0.1 to 0.7&nbsp;cm (0.05<U+2013>0.3&nbsp;in)  wide. The small yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to May), followed by small green fleshy fruit known as [[drupe]]s. Within the genus ''[[Persoonia]]'', it is a member of the ''Lanceolata'' group of 58 closely related species.  ''P.&nbsp;linearis'' interbreeds with several other species where they grow together.

Found in dry [[sclerophyll]] forest on [[sandstone]]-based nutrient-deficient soils, ''P.&nbsp;linearis'' is adapted to a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] from beneath their thick bark after [[bushfire]]s. The fruit are consumed by vertebrates such as [[kangaroo]], [[possum]]s and [[currawong]]s. As with other members of the genus, ''P.&nbsp;linearis'' is rare in [[horticulture|cultivation]] as it is very hard to [[Plant propagation|propagate]], either by seed or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]].  It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring [[Soil pH|acidic soils]] with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.

''Persoonia linearis'' grows as a tall shrub to small tree, occasionally reaching 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) in height but more commonly around 2<U+2013>3&nbsp;m (7<U+2013>10&nbsp;ft) tall.<ref name=Fairley>{{cite book |author=Fairley, Alan; Moore, Philip |title=Native Plants of the Sydney District: An Identification Guide |year=2000 |edition=2nd |publisher=Kangaroo Press |page=159 |location=Kenthurst, New South Wales |isbn=0-7318-1031-7}}</ref> The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface,<ref name=FoA/> while deeper layers are reddish. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire.<ref name=weston03/> The new growth is hairy.

==Distribution and habitat==
One of the most common geebungs,{{sfn|Wrigley|1991|p=489}} ''Persoonia linearis'' is found from the [[Macleay River]] catchment on the New South Wales [[Mid North Coast]] to the Tambo River in eastern Victoria.<ref name=FoA/>  It is found from sea level to altitudes of 1000&nbsp;m (3500&nbsp;ft) with an average yearly rainfall of 700 to 1400&nbsp;mm (28<U+2013>55&nbsp;in).<ref name=Benson2000/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Neave, Helen M.; Norton, Toyn W. |title=Biological Inventory for Conservation Evaluation: IV.

In the [[Sydney Basin]], it is associated with such trees as Sydney peppermint (''[[Eucalyptus piperita]]''), silvertop ash (''[[Eucalyptus sieberi|E.&nbsp;sieberi]]''), blue-leaved stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus agglomerata|E.&nbsp;agglomerata]]''), blackbutt (''[[Eucalyptus pilularis|E.&nbsp;pilularis]]''), grey ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus paniculata|E.&nbsp;paniculata]]''), snappy gum (''[[Eucalyptus rossii|E.&nbsp;rossii]]''), Sydney blue gum (''[[Eucalyptus saligna|E.&nbsp;saligna]]''),  narrow-leaved stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus sparsifolia|E.&nbsp;sparsifolia]]'') and smooth-barked apple (''[[Angophora costata]]'') and shrubs such as ''[[Grevillea obtusiflora]]'', ''[[Grevillea phylicoides|G.&nbsp;phylicoides]]'', Kowmung hakea (''[[Hakea dohertyi]]''), long leaf smoke bush (''[[Conospermum longifolium]]'') and stiff geebung (''[[Persoonia rigida]]'').<ref name=Benson2000/> In the vicinity of [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]] and [[Jervis Bay]], it is an understory component of the widespread Currambene Lowlands Forest community, alongside such plants as gorse bitter pea (''[[Daviesia ulicifolia]]''), bearded heath (''[[Leucopogon juniperinus]]'') and native daphne (''[[Pittosporum undulatum]]'') with spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]''), white stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus globoidea]]'') and woollybutt (''[[Eucalyptus longifolia|E.&nbsp;longifolia]]'') as the dominant trees. The tall dry sclerophyll forest is on hilly terrain with good drainage.

==Ecology==
[[File:Plinearistrunk.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Regrowing from base of trunk after being burnt in low intensity fire, [[Georges River National Park]]. Also highlighting colour and texture of trunk]]

''Persoonia linearis'' is one of several species of ''Persoonia'' that regenerate by [[Resprouter|resprouting]] from trunks or stems greater than 2&nbsp;cm (0.8&nbsp;in) thick after [[bushfire]],<ref name=Benson2000/> an adaptation to the [[Fire ecology|fire-prone]] habitat where it grows.<ref name=weston03/> However, only larger trunks of 12<U+2013>16&nbsp;cm (4.7<U+2013>6.3&nbsp;in) diameter might survive to reshoot after very hot fires.<ref name="morrison2000">{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=David A.|coauthors=Renwick, John A.|date=2000|title=Effects of Variation in Fire Intensity on Regeneration of Co-occurring Species of Small Trees in the Sydney Region|journal=Australian Journal of Botany|volume=48|issue=1|pages=71<U+2013>79|doi=10.1071/BT98059}}</ref> The thick papery bark shields and insulates the underlying [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] from the flames.<ref name=weston03/> The plant can reshoot from the base, but generally only if the stem or trunk is killed.<ref name="morrison2000"/>

[[Colletidae|Colletid]] bees of the genus ''[[Leioproctus]]'', subgenus ''[[Cladocerapis]]'' exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of ''Persoonia''.

==Cultivation==
''Persoonia linearis'' is useful as a [[Hedge|hedging]] plant and responds well to [[pruning]].{{sfn|Elliot|Jones|1997|p=221}} Its foliage has been used in [[Floristry|floral arrangements]], and its colourful bark is a horticultural feature.{{sfn|Wrigley|1991|p=489}} It is a fairly easy plant to grow in gardens, but is rarely seen due to difficulties in [[Plant propagation|propagation]].{{sfn|Wrigley|1991|p=489}} [[Germination]] from seed is low, and can take many months.{{sfn|Wrigley|1991|p=476}} Once established it can tolerate extended dry periods and is hardy to frosts.{{sfn|Elliot|Jones|1997|p=221}} Optimum growing conditions are part shade and a well-drained [[soil pH|acid soil]], though ''P.&nbsp;linearis'' grows readily in full sun.{{sfn|Elliot|Jones|1997|p=221}} Persoonias in general are sensitive to excessive [[phosphorus]], and grow without fertiliser or with low-phosphorus [[Slow release|slow-release]] formulations. They can also become deficient in [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron]] and [[Manganese deficiency (plant)|manganese]].{{sfn|Elliot|Jones|1997|p=206}} First cultivated in England in 1794 from seed, it was also reportedly propagated from [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]];{{sfn|Wrigley|1991|p=476}} Andrews described it as a "handsome greenhouse plant, continuing to flower through the autumnal months and producing good seeds."<ref name="hcandrews"/> Joseph Knight reported that cuttings would be successful as long as material was "judiciously chosen", and that plants had set seed on occasion.<ref name="Knight 1809"/>

A compound with [[antimicrobial]] activity was isolated from the ripening drupes of a hybrid of ''Persoonia linearis'' and ''P.&nbsp;pinifolia'' growing in the [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] in 1994, and identified as 4-hydroxyphenyl 6-''O''-[(3''R'')-3,4-dihydroxy-2-methylenebutanoyl]-<U+03B2>-{{smallcaps all|D}}-glucopyranoside.<ref>{{cite journal | author=MacLeod, John K.; Rasmussen, Hasse B.; Willis, Anthony C. |title=A New Glycoside Antimicrobial Agent from ''Persoonia linearis'' <U+00D7> ''pinifolia'' |journal=Journal of Natural Products |year=1997 |volume=60|issue=6 |pages=620<U+2013>22 |doi=10.1021/np970006a |pmid=9296952}}</ref>
