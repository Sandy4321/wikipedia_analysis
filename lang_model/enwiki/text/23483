The '''Royal Grammar School''' is an English [[Independent school|independent]] day school for boys in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]]. It was founded in 1509 by the will of Robert Beckingham, a wealthy grocer, and moved to the present site on the [[High Street]] after the granting of a royal charter from [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] in 1552. The school is home to a rare example of a [[chained library]] established by [[John Parkhurst]], Bishop of Norwich, in 1575 and is also the site of the first recorded game of cricket around the year 1550.[[#cricket|<sup>[a]</sup>]] The current headmaster is Dr. Jon Cox who has occupied the post since 2007 and is the 35th headmaster of the school. The school is a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and has a reputation for being one of the top schools academically in the country.

Tuition at the school was initially free, but with the introduction of comprehensive education and the abolition of grammar schools the school became independent and fee paying in 1977 . The school now has approximately 900 students, about 300 of whom are in the sixth form. However the school maintains a grammar school ethos, and as such operates numerous outreach schemes for local students in maintained education.

==History==
The founding of the [[school]] dates to 1509 and the death of Robert Beckingham, a wealthy [[grocer]], and a member of the [[Worshipful Company of Grocers]] and a [[Freeman of the City of London]]. In his will he requested that the parishioners of St Olave's church, [[Southwark]], should obtain a licence to endow a chantry priest to say masses for his soul. If they failed to do this within two years of his death, his executors had discretion either to use the property to 'make a free scole at the Towne of Guldford' or to put the income to some other good charitable use.<ref name="surhist">{{cite news |url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/GetRecord/SHCOL_1775_(PART2OF2) |title=ROYAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL (FORMERLY THE FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL OF KING EDWARD VI), GUILDFORD: RECORDS, 1553-1965 |last= |first= |date= |work=Surrey History: Exploring Surrey's Past |accessdate=20 December 2010 |location=}}</ref> The license was not obtained within the required time, and so in 1512, Beckingham's executors formerly conveyed the lands in the bequest to a body of trustees consisting of the Mayor of Guildford and four 'sad and discrete men' who had formerly been mayors. With the rents they were to provide a free grammar school in Guildford with a 'sufficient schoolmaster',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Brief+History+of++the+School&pid=12 |title=Royal Grammar School Website |accessdate=2010-012-20}}</ref>  to teach thirty "of the poorest-men's sons" to read and write English and cast accounts perfectly, so that they would be fit to become apprentices.<ref>Brayley, p370</ref>

[[Image:RGS old building.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''The Old Building'']]

Over the coming years the school ran into considerable finical difficulty and so The Mayor and Approved Men of Guildford petitioned [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] to grant them further endowments for maintenance. One of the kings closest advisors, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William Parr]], had a particular affection for the town having himself spent a large amount of time as the Kings manor house in Guildford, and it was he who advised the King to re-appropriate some of the funds arising from the [[Chantries Acts#Abolition of Chantries Acts.2C 1545 and 1547|Abolition of the Chantries Acts]] to the school.<ref>Russel, p.97</ref> Thus in January 1552 Edward VI ordered that there was to be "one Grammar School in Guildford called the Free Grammar School of King Edward VI for the education, institution and instruction of boys and youths in Grammar at all future times forever to endure", along with a grant of 20 pounds per year. The high street site was purchased in 1555 with the construction of the [[Listed building|Grade I listed]] [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] Old Building<ref name="engherlist">{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=288983&resourceID=5 |title=Heritage Gateway |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> starting in 1557. It was finally completed in 1586.

The death of Dr.[[John Parkhurst]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], in 1575 resulted in the founding of the schools' chained library.<ref>Brayley, p70</ref> In his will he gave "the most parte of all my Latten bookes whereof shall be made a catalogue as shortelie as I may God sendinge me lief." although obtaining these books was not without its difficulties. Since this date the library has been added to, most notably between 1600 and 1800.<ref>Cambray, p554</ref> The library is housed within the Gallery (now the Headmaster's Study) in the Old Building, with the present bookcases dating from 1897. The oldest book within the library was printed in [[Venice]] around the year 1480, with the oldest english book printed in circa 1500 bearing the imprint of [[Wynkyn de Worde]]. Today the library is one of the few remaining examples of a chained library located within a school.<ref name="chain">{{cite web |url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=+The+Chained+Library&pid=13 |title=School Website - Chained Library |accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>

{{anchor|cricket}}In 1598, a court case about an ownership dispute over a plot of land located somewhere along the lower high street referred to a sport called ''kreckett'' being played at the school around 1550. John Derrick, one of the queens coroners for the county of Surrey attested that some 50 years earlier ''"When he was a scholler in the free school of Guldeford, he and several of his fellowes did runne and play there at kreckett and other plaies."''<ref>Russel, p.203</ref> The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives this as the first recorded instance of [[cricket]] in the [[English language]].<ref name="cc1">{{cite web | url=http://oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/44388 |title=Oxford English Dictionary Online |accessdate=2009-09-30}}</ref><ref name="cc7">{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239757.html  |title=ESPN CricInfo - History  |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Royal_Grammar_School,_Guildford_-_Original_Charter.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''The original charter granted to the school by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]]'']]

After the granting of the charter, it took 50 years before the first set of statutes to govern the school were completed. They were finally approved by the [[Bishop of Winchester]] on 16 September 1608, and they constituted a major change in the way the school was run. Up until this point the boys were instructed in English and accounting, but following the statutes lessons were in the subjects of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], with students required to speak in Latin unless licensed by the master to do otherwise. Admissions following the charter changed, with  "''none to be admitted scholar into the said school before he be brought to the schoolmaster of that school, and upon his examination shall be found to have learned the rudiments of grammar, called the Accidence."'' All scholars from Guildford were required to pay the master 5 [[shillings]] on admission to the school, or if he was not from the town the charge was 10s. The number of pupils at the school was capped at 100, although this number was rarely reached. The statues also saw the introduction of school fees. Although the defined as a "free" school fees were still charged at the rate of 4s per annum, paid as 9d per quarter, with an additional shilling due on the feast of [[St. Michael]], which was used to pay for "clean, wax candles".<ref>Brayley, p371</ref>

In 1866 the then headmaster Revd Henry G Merriman (Headmaster 1859-75) purchased Allen House, a large house set in extensive grounds which stood opposite the school. The house took its name from Anthony Allen, Master of Chancery and Mayor of Guildford in 1740. This was initially used as a boarding house for the school between 1866-74 before later being purchased by [[Surrey County Council]] in 1921 and was used by the school up until its demolition in 1964. The grounds surrounding the house were purchased in 1914 by HA Powell and donated to the school as playing fields.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Buildings&pid=16 |title=Royal Grammar School Website |accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref> 

During the mid to late 19th century the school fell into disrepair and decay. Guildford Municipal Charities established a committee to report into the general condition of the school and the buildings. The committee reported in 1881 that the school had no funds available for repairs and that there were only 9 boys 'instead of the former ordinary number of 100'. Various suggestions were made by the Charity Commission to raise funds for the school, including a reorganisation with [[George Abbot School|Archbishop Abbot's School]],  The Committee for Maintaining Higher Education in Guildford was established in Mar 1887 to oppose the Charity Commission's draft scheme to amalgamate the RGS, Nettle's Charity and Archbishop Abbot's School. The committee raised <U+00A3>2,238.15s.4d (approximately <U+00A3>108,000 in 2010)<ref>http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid</ref> towards the restoration of the RGS, ensuring its survival.<ref name="surhist"/> A new Charity Commission scheme came into effect in November 1888  which resulted in the Old Building being restored, and the schools continuation as a day only school. Several years later under the [[Education Act 1944]] the school adopted [[voluntary controlled school|voluntary controlled]] status; tuition was therefore free and entrance was to be by common examination at the age of eleven.

The construction of the New Building started in 1958 in the grounds of Allen House and initially consisted of a gymnasium, assembly hall, dining hall and kitchens, caretaker's flat, staff common rooms, junior library, cloakrooms and changing rooms, eight classrooms, science lecture theatre, five science laboratories, geography and art rooms, and various offices, stores and smaller rooms arranged in a J shape. The construction of the initial building was finished in 1963.

[[Image:RGS Guildford 500 Logo.png|thumb|alt=RGS Guildford 500 Logo|The Logo used by the school during the year 2009/2010, to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the founding of the school.]]

On the morning of Sunday 2 December a fire ripped through the Old Building, gutting a large part of the building including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. It is thought that the fire started in the Hamonde room ([[England|English]] master JC Mallison<U+2019>s classroom), although the actual cause of the fire is still unknown. The main priority of the numerous members of staff and friends of the school who tried to help was to save the books in the Chained Library from being damaged by flames, smoke or water from the Fire Brigade<U+2019>s hose pipes. The books were saved but one casualty of the rescue was [[Art]] master Ron Smoothey, who was injured by a water-filled lampshade falling on his head. Rebuilding took two and a half years, partly because the [[Winter of 1962<U+2013>1963 in the United Kingdom|Big Freeze]] of early 1963 meant that work could not proceed normally with temperatures dropping to -17C at night.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/_files/newsletters/1848-Newsletter2.pdf |title=RGS Foundation Newsletter |accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref> 

The School became independent in 1977 when the parents and staff of the school, lead by the Chairman of the Governors, John Fergrieve Brown, raised sufficient funds to purchase the school.  As a result the RGS withdrew from the [[government]] maintained system becoming independent and fee paying. This was followed the following year by the purchase of [[Lanesborough School|Lanesborough Preparatory School]] which became the junior school, preparing boys for entry to the RGS at either 11 or 13.

More recently in 2003 construction finished on a new <U+00A3>5 million Sports Centre and All Weather Training Area with Shooting Range. Followed shortly after in 2006 refurbishments were made to the Old Building site with the old gymnasium being converted into a Sixth Form Centre and the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] science laboratories (some of the earliest in the country) have been converted to the Art School.

In the year 2009/2010 the school celebrated the Quincentennial Anniversary of the founding of the school by Robert Beckingham, numerous events were organised, including the commissioning of a new musical work by the Director of Music, Peter White, entitled "Shall Life Inherit" based loosely on the school hymn [[To be a Pilgrim]] by [[John Bunyan]].<ref name="getsurrey1">{{cite news |url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2067523_teacher_set_for_guildford_cathedral_music_premiere |title=Teacher set for Guildford Cathedral music prmiere |last=Millers |first=Vita |date=12 March 2010 |work=Get Surrey Online |accessdate=20 December 2010 |location=Guildford}}</ref> This year also saw a visit from [[HRH The Princess Royal]].<ref name="getsurrey2">{{cite news |url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2071121_princess_visits_500yearold_royal_grammar_school |title=Princess visits 500-year-old Royal Grammar School |last= |first= |date=14 May 2010 |work=Get Surrey Online |accessdate=20 December 2010 |location=Guildford}}</ref><ref name="ndesk">{{cite news |url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/view/news/buckingham-palace-national-royal-diary-of-engagements-31st-march-2010-5007 |title=List of Royal Engagements |last= |first= |date= 31 March 2010 |work= |accessdate=22 December 2010 |location=}}</ref>

==School life==
===Terms===
As in most schools in the UK there are three [[Academic term|terms]] in the Academic year:<ref name="sw1">{{cite news |url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Term+Dates&pid=39 |title=School Website |last= |first= |date= |work= |accessdate=22 December 2010 |location=}}</ref>
* The ''Michaelmas Term'' from early September to mid-December. This is the normal term for new boys to be admitted into the school
* The ''Lent Term'' from early January to a time a week or two before whenever [[Easter]] falls that year
* The ''Trinity Term'' from mid-late April to early July, during which time boys sit most public exams

===House system===
There are six [[House system|houses]] at the RGS, named after various benefactors of the school:

Each pupil is assigned to one of the six houses upon joining the school, and a pupil's house can be indicated to others by optional colour-related clothing.<ref name="sw2">{{cite news |url= http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=About+the+RGS+%26raquo%3B+School+Uniform&pid=413 |title=School Website |last= |first= |date= |work= |accessdate=22 December 2010 |location=}}</ref> If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do so, they are put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (e.g. Rugby, Hockey, Reading, Chess, etc..) and then at the end of the year the points awarded in each event throughout the year, and the winning house is awarded the Cock House Cup.

The school's official livery colour is green, picked as a house-neutral colour.

===School uniform===
The school's uniform up to the end of Fifth Form consists of a white or grey shirt, black or grey long trousers and a navy blue school blazer. For the lower and upper sixth, dark coloured suits are instead worn, and upper sixth formers are permitted to wear coloured shirts.<ref name="sw2"/> All years are required to wear an approved school tie, of which there are a vast number. Various ties are awarded for sporting, artistic or social achievements, along with house colours awarded for services to the house, and Senior Prefect ties awarded to those with the position. Recently there have also been commemorative ties celebrating 450 years since the granting of the Royal Charter, and 500 years since the founding of the school.

==Sport==
Sport plays an integral part of life at the RGS, it is compulsory for all years during games periods and if selected for a team can require compulsory attendance on Saturdays. Sport is also important in the [[#History|history of the school]], as it was the site of the first recorded game of cricket around the year 1550 ([[#cricket|see above]]).

*In the Michaelmas Term [[Rugby Union]] is the dominant sport, although [[Field hockey|Hockey]] is also played.
*In the Lent Term Hockey is the dominant sport however [[Rugby sevens]] is popular above the Fourth form.
*In the Trinity Term [[Cricket]] is the main sport, although [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is also a popular option.

[[File:RGS Guildford Bradstone Brook.jpg|left|thumb|View towards the First XI cricket pitch and clubhouse at the school playing fields, Bradstone Brook.]]The sports of [[Badminton]], [[Cross Country]], [[Fencing]], [[Association football|Football]], [[Golf]], [[Judo]], [[Rowing]], [[Sailing]], [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] and [[Tennis]] are also available to certain year groups during the games period, and the list varies by term.<ref name="sport1">{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Sport&pid=125 |title=School Website - Sport |accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> Sixth form also carries a "Spectrum" games option where boys are permitted to use any of the facilities at [[Guildford Spectrum]] during the games period.

The school has enjoyed some success in the sporting arena especially in Rugby where they have had many first and second place finishes at various levels of the [[Daily Mail Cup]].<ref name="rugby">{{cite web | url=http://www.schoolsrugby.co.uk/tnt_DailyMailArchive3.asp |title=Daily Mail Cup Results Archive |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> Since 2003 the six Royal Grammar Schools ([[Colchester Royal Grammar School|Colchester]], [[RGS High Wycombe|High Wycombe]], Guildford, [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School|Lancaster]], [[RGS Newcastle|Newcastle]], [[RGS Worcester|Worcester]]) have held the "RGS Cricket Festival", hosted by a different school each year.

Due to the town centre location the school has no playing fields on site, however a 20 [[acre]] site, called Bradstone Brook, located a few miles away in the village of [[Chilworth, Surrey|Chilworth]]. The site was originally the grounds of a Grade II listed manor house of the same name located to the [[south]] of the site.

==Extra-curicular==
===Music===
Although Music is part of the core curriculum for First to Third Form the majority occurs outside of the classroom. A large number of boys takes lessons with peripatetic music staff across numerous instruments and there is a full [[Symphony Orchestra]] composed of students, along with several other smaller classical ensembles. The majority of the Old Building is now occupied by the Music Department and as a result there are a number of performing venues, including the historic Big School, as a result the school hosts a large number of small concerts within the school as well as playing at much larger events, including a special quincentenary concert on 6 May 2010 at [[St John's Smith Square]]<ref name=rgsfnd15>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/_files/foundationbulletin15.pdf |title=RGS Foundation Newsletter 15 |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> and another at Guildford Cathedral.<ref name="geye7">{{cite news |url=http://www.guildfordeye.com/visitor/news/more.detail/news.php?record_id=322&news_category=Entertainment&cat=Entertainment |title=Ambitious RGS Concert At Cathedral |last=  |first= |date=3 March 2010 |work=Surrey Advertiser Online |accessdate=30 December 2010 |location=Guildford}}</ref> In addition to classical music, there are also a number of [[jazz]] and [[Rock music|rock]] bands within the school as well, and to recognise this in addition to the four main music prizes awarded each year, there is an additional contemporary music prize.<ref name="mus">{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Music&pid=129 |title=School Website - Music |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>

===Period 8===
Period 8 is the general term used to describe a specific set of extra-curricular activities that occur during an extended period eight on a Monday afternoon and includes a [[Combined Cadet Force]] which is over 100 years old,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/_files/newsletters/rgsfoundationbulletin14.pdf |title=RGS Foundation Newsletter 14 |accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref> Outdoor Pursuits, [[Scouts]], Lifesaving and Community Service among others. There are also five field days spread throughout the year on which these activities also take place. In the third form boys have the opportunity to decide between CCF (Army and Navy Sections only), Outdoor Pursuits and Scouts. More options open up through the school, including the RAF section of the CCF. [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] scheme was, until recently, available as a Period 8 option, however it has recently moved to be available to all students, regardless of their option, so no longer officially constitutes part of Period 8.<ref name=rgsp8>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Monday+Period+8&pid=476 |title=School Website |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref>

===Clubs and societies===
There are several dozen clubs and societies at the school,<ref name=rgssoc>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Clubs+and+Societies&pid=346 |title=School Website |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=rgssoclist>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/downloadfile.asp?file=171 |title=School Website - Societies List |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> many of these are where pupils get together to discuss a topic of particular interest sometimes with a guest speaker. Past speakers include the ex-government drug adviser Professor [[David Nutt]] among many others. There are a wide variety of different societies ranging from the normal such as [[Badminton]] and [[Amnesty International]] to the more obscure like "Quirks and Remnants" and the "RumDoodle Society".

===Publications===
The school has two sets of publications acting to summarise recent school events; one is the ''Guildfordian'' published annually, it contains pieces ranging from images of impressive student artwork to university destinations of the leaving school year; the other originally published as ''Really Good Stuff'' and now published as ''The Register'', is a termly newsletter documenting significant achievements of the pupils. A weekly news letter is published on line every Tuesday.

==Admission and fees==
Initially tuition at the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents obtained from lands the most significant arising from the [[Chantries_Acts#Abolition_of_Chantries_Acts.2C_1545_and_1547|Abolition of the Chantries Acts]],<ref name="surhist"/> and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school.<ref name=rgshist>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Brief+History+of++the+School&pid=12 |title=Royal Grammar School Website |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2010/2011 they are <U+00A3>13,023 (approximately [[<U+20AC>]]15,300 or US$20,000 as of December 2010)<ref name=rgsfees>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Fees&pid=56 |title=School Website |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, [[Mathematics]] and [[Verbal Reasoning]] and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so that boys who are at [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ [[Common Entrance Examination|Common Entrance]] or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.

Numerous [[scholarship]]s are available at both 11+ and 13+ for Music, Academic achievement, and one for Art at thirteen. Music and Academic scholarships range in value between 5%-20% with one Kings Scholarship available for a 20% reduction in fees. These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances, and an interview with the headmaster for Academic or Music scholarships, or the presentation of a portfolio of work for the Art scholarship.<ref name=rgsadmis1>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/_files/rgs_admissions_policy__protocol_2010.pdf |title=RGS Admissions Policy and Protocol 2009/2010 |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> Until the start of the 2009/2010 academic year, the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King's Scholarships worth 50% of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10-30%.<ref name=rgsadmis1/><ref name=rgsadmis2>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/downloadfile.asp?file=29 |title=RGS Admissions Policy |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="rgsmus">{{cite news |url=http://rgsmusic.tommedley.com/about/ |title=RGS Music Department Blog |last= |first= |date=8 July 2010 |work= |accessdate=23 December 2010 |location=}}</ref> This reduction was seen due to the increase in [[bursary|bursaries]] available from the school.

==Charitable status and public benefit==
The school is a registered charity and currently has three charities registered with the [[Charities Commission]]: ''King Edward VI's Grammar School (The Royal Grammar School), Guildford'',<ref name="char3">{{cite web | url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/SHOWCHARITY/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=312028&SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charities Commission- 312028 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> ''The Royal Grammar School Guildford'' (representing the Governors),<ref name="char1">{{cite web | url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/SHOWCHARITY/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1084866&SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charities Commission- 1084866 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> and ''The Royal Grammar School Guildford Foundation''<ref name="char2">{{cite web | url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/SHOWCHARITY/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1089955&SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charities Commission- 1089955 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> After the withdrawal of the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] in 1997 the social diversity of the school decreased, as a result the school began to offer bursaries to students whose parents could not afford the fees,<ref name="schoolweb98">{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Bursaries&pid=57 |title=School Website - Bursaries |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>  with the first bursary offered in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rgs-guildford.co.uk/_files/newsletters/2771-Foundation%20Bulletin10%2017_5a.pdf |title=RGS Foundation Newsletter 10 |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>
