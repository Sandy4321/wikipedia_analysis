The '''Battle of Bound Brook''' (April 13, 1777) was a surprise attack conducted by British and Hessian forces against a [[Continental Army]] outpost at [[Bound Brook, New Jersey]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The British objective of capturing the entire garrison was not met, although prisoners were taken, and the American commander, Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]], left in great haste, abandoning papers and personal effects.

Late on the evening of April 12, 4,000 British and Hessian troops under the command of Lieutenant General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] marched from the British stronghold of [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].  All but one detachment reached positions surrounding the outpost before the battle began near daybreak the next morning.  During the battle most of the 500 man garrison escaped by the unblocked route.  American reinforcements arrived in the afternoon, but not before the British plundered the outpost and began the return march to New Brunswick. 

==Background==
{{main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
Following the Battles of [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] in December 1776 and January 1777, the [[Continental Army]] of Major General [[George Washington]] entered winter quarters in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], while the British and German forces of Lieutenant General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] settled into winter quarters in [[New York City]] and northeastern [[New Jersey]].<ref>McGuire, pp. 6<U+2013>8</ref>  Throughout the winter months, a [[Forage War|guerrilla war]] of sorts went on, in which American militia companies, sometimes with Continental Army support, harassed British and German outposts and ambushed their foraging and raiding expeditions.<ref>McGuire, p. 17</ref>  One of the forward bases used for these operations was at [[Bound Brook, New Jersey|Bound Brook]], located on the [[Raritan River]] upriver from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], the major British camp in New Jersey.<ref>McGuire, pp. 8, 20</ref>  The post was responsible for patrolling three bridges across the Raritan likely to be used by the British in moves against the main camp at Morristown.<ref>Davis, p. 6</ref>

[[Image:NorthernNewJersey1777.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Detail from a 1777 map of the area.  The Bound Brook outpost was near the spot labeled "Bridgewater" on this map.]]
In February 1777 the Bound Brook outpost consisted of 1,000 men under the command of Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]], but this was reduced by expiring militia enlistments to 500 in mid-March.<ref name=Mat37>Mattern, p. 37</ref>  The troops that remained were from the [[8th Pennsylvania Regiment]], a company from the 4th Continental Artillery, and two independent companies from the [[Wyoming Valley]] in what is now northeastern [[Pennsylvania]], but was then also claimed by [[Connecticut]] as [[Westmoreland County, Connecticut|Westmoreland County]].<ref>''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'', Volume 4, p. 458<!--artillery--></ref><ref>Boucher, p. 138<!--8th PA--></ref><ref>Connecticut Historical Society, p. 263</ref>  Lincoln expressed concern over his exposed position to General Washington, noting that many units were not in a position to "render the least assistance to this post in case it is attacked", and that he was keeping wagons ready in case a precipitate departure was needed.<ref name=Mat37/>  Lieutenant General Lord [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], in command of the British forces in New Jersey, had had enough of the ongoing ''petite guerre'', and organized a reprisal action against the Bound Brook outpost.<ref name=McG21/>  According to the Hessian [[j<U+00E4>ger (military)|j<U+00E4>ger]] Captain [[Johann Ewald]], Cornwallis asked him to draft a plan of attack in February, but the plan could not be executed until springtime because it necessitated [[Ford (crossing)|fording]] the Raritan.<ref>Ewald, p. 55</ref>  On the night of April 12, the plan was put into action.<ref name=McG21>McGuire, p. 21</ref>

Under the overall command of Cornwallis, 4,000 British and Hessian troops marched from New Brunswick to make a multi-pronged surprise attack.  The right flank, under the command of Major General [[James Grant (British Army officer)|James Grant]], consisted of the Hessian [[j<U+00E4>ger (military)|j<U+00E4>ger]] corps, [[grenadier]]s from the English [[Brigade of Guards]], and a detachment of British light [[dragoons]].<ref name=McG21_22/>  While most of this column advanced from Raritan Landing (opposite New Brunswick on the left, or Bound Brook side, of the river), two companies of light infantry went further right, aiming to cut off the main road from Bound Brook to the Continental Army camp at Morristown.<ref name=E56>Ewald, p. 56</ref>  The center, under the command of Hessian Colonel [[Carl von Donop]], consisted of the Hessian grenadier battalions von Linsing and Minnigerode, and the left, commanded by Cornwallis, consisted of two battalions of British [[light infantry]], the 1st battalion of grenadiers, and another detachment of light dragoons.<ref name=McG21_22>McGuire, pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref><ref>It was British army practice at the time to combine light infantry and grenadier companies from an army's regiments into brigades separate from the infantry of the regiment;  because of this, detailed regimental identifications are not possible for some of the units involved in this action. (Ward, p. 26)</ref> Donop's column advanced up the right bank of the Raritan, aiming to gain control of the bridge directly at Bound Brook, while Cornwallis took a longer route to ford the river above Bound Brook and thus cut off the possibility of retreat in that direction.<ref name=E56/>

Ewald and a few of his j<U+00E4>gers were in the vanguard of Grant's column and engaged the American sentries to the south of Bound Brook.  Unaware that this was supposed to be a [[feint]], Ewald drove the sentries back nearly to the main [[redoubt]] where the outpost's cannons were located.  By sunrise he was nearly surrounded; the timely arrival of von Donop's column just over the river, and the attack by Cornwallis's column prompted the Americans to begin abandoning the post.<ref>Ewald, p. 57</ref>  The surprise was very nearly complete; the Pennsylvania artillery company, which had been manning the redoubt, was severely mauled, with numerous killed and captured.<ref>''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'', Volume 4, p. 459</ref>  Colonel von Donop reported that General Lincoln "must have retired ''en Profond N<U+00E9>glig<U+00E9>''" ("profoundly undressed", or naked),<ref name=McG22>McGuire, p. 22</ref> and Lincoln's papers were taken.<ref name=D9>Davis, p. 9</ref>  The British plan was marred by the early skirmishing involving Ewald, and the too-late arrival of the companies sent to cut off the road to Morristown; Many Americans escaped via this route.<ref name=McG22/>   The British captured also cannons, ammunition, and supplies, and looted Bound Brook, but returned to New Brunswick later that morning.<ref name=Mat37/>

==Aftermath==
{{main|Philadelphia campaign}}
The Continental Army response was immediate; Washington sent a large force under Major General [[Nathanael Greene]] to reoccupy Bound Brook.<ref name=McG23/>  The British had already left by the time they arrived; Greene sent a detachment to harass their rear guard.  This detachment caught up with the British near Raritan Landing, where they killed 8 and captured 16.<ref>Davis, p. 13</ref>

General Howe reported that about 30 Americans were killed and 80 to 90 were captured, while General Lincoln reported that 60 of his men were killed or wounded.<ref name=D9/><ref name=Mat37/> Howe claimed no deaths and seven wounded among the British and Hessians.<ref name=D10/>  Washington reported that "[t]he enemy lost the post at Eleven O'Clock the same day, & our people took possession of it again", and that the army's losses were "trifling and not worth mentioning".<ref name=McG23>McGuire, p. 23</ref>  He did, however, also report that between 35 and 40 killed or captured, and the loss of three field cannons.<ref name=McG23/>  General Greene reported to his wife, "The British Generals breakfasted and I [dined] at the same house that day".<ref name=McG23/>

Washington, concerned that the attack presaged an early start to the campaign season, worried that his troops were not yet in place to deal with major British movements.  Two weeks later, after no further major activity, the Americans learned that "the Enemy are to take the field the first of June."<ref name=McG23/>

[[Image:BattleofBB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The battlefield marker in Bound Brook, NJ]]
Washington recognized that Bound Brook itself was a difficult place to defend. On May 26 he withdrew the garrison, and on May 28, he moved part of his army from Morristown to [[Middlebrook encampment|a new entrenched camp]] near [[Middle Brook (New Jersey)|Middle Brook]], just north of Bound Brook but well protected between the first and second [[Watchung Mountains|Watchung Mountain ranges]]; other troops were stationed near [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].<ref>McGuire, p. 27</ref><ref>Ward, p. 325</ref>  From the top of the Watchung Mountains Washington monitored British movements while the two sides continued to skirmish.  Both sides also engaged in intelligence gathering, each trying to determine the strength and intentions of the other.<ref>McGuire, pp. 27<U+2013>37</ref>

On June 12 Howe marched a significant force (more than 18,000 men) out of New Brunswick, through Bound Brook, and as far as [[Somerset, New Jersey|Somerset]], apparently in an attempt to draw Washington out of the hills.  Washington, aware that Howe had left the army's heavy baggage behind, was not fooled and refused to move.  Howe then abruptly retreated back to [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]] on June 19, upon which Washington had some of his troops give chase, and he moved down out of the hills.<ref>Ward, p. 326</ref>  A week later Howe tried to spring a trap on one of Washington's detachments that would have cut the American retreat into the hills off; this effort was repulsed in the [[Battle of Short Hills]].<ref>Ward, p. 327</ref>  After this failure, Howe embarked his army on transports and set sail for the [[Chesapeake Bay]], intending to take Philadelphia from the south.<ref>Ward, p. 329</ref>
