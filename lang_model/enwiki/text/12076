The '''Northrop F-5A/B Freedom Fighter''' and '''F-5E/F Tiger II''' are part of a family of widely used light [[supersonic]] [[fighter aircraft]], designed and built by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] in the United States, beginning in the 1960s. Hundreds remain in service in air forces around the world in the early 21st Century, and the type has also been the basis for a number of other aircraft.

The F-5 started life as a privately funded light fighter program by Northrop in the 1950s. The first generation F-5A Freedom Fighter entered service in the 1960s. Over 800 were produced through 1972 for U.S. allies during the [[Cold War]] and for [[Switzerland]] as well. The USAF had no need for a light fighter, but it did specify a requirement for a supersonic trainer and procured about 1,200 of a derivative airframe for this purpose, the [[T-38 Talon]].

The improved second-generation F-5E Tiger II was also primarily used by American Cold War allies and, in limited quantities, served in US military aviation as a training and aggressor aircraft; Tiger II production amounted to 1,400 of all versions, with production ending in 1987. Many F-5s continuing in service into the 1990s and 2000s have undergone a wide variety of upgrade programs to keep pace with the changing combat environment. The F-5 was also developed into a dedicated reconnaissance version, the '''RF-5 Tigereye'''.

The F-5 served as a starting point for a series of design studies which resulted in the twin-tailed [[Northrop YF-17]] and the [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] series of carrier-based fighters. The [[F-20 Tigershark]] was an advanced version of the F-5E that did not find a market.  The F-5N/F variants remain in service with the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] as an [[Dissimilar air combat training|adversary trainer]].<ref name="USN F-5N"/>

==Design and development==
[[File:Northrop YF-5A.jpg|thumb|The first Northrop YF-5A prototype aircraft]]

In the mid-1950s, [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] started development on a low-cost, low-maintenance fighter, with the company designation N-156, partly to meet a US Navy requirement for a jet fighter to operate from its [[Escort Carrier]]s, which were too small to operate the Navy's existing jet fighters.  This requirement disappeared when the Navy decided to withdraw the Escort Carriers, but Northrop continued development of the N-156, with both a two seat advanced trainer (the '''N-156T'''), and a single-seat fighter (the '''N-156F''') planned.  The N-156 was based on the use of a pair of an afterburning version of the [[General Electric J85]] [[jet engine|engine]] which was originally designed to power the tiny McDonnell [[ADM-20 Quail]] decoy, then carried by the [[B-52 bomber]]. This requirement created a very small engine with a very high thrust-to-weight ratio.<ref name="Claws p111-4">Braybrook 1982, pp. 111<U+2013>114.</ref>

The N-156T was selected by the [[United States Air Force]] as a replacement for the [[T-33 Shooting Star|T-33]] in July 1965, allowing development of the trainer to progress at full speed, the first example, later designated [[T-38 Talon|YT-38 Talon]], flying on 12 June 1959 with a total of 1,158 Talons being built by the time production ended in January 1972.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p50-1">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 50<U+2013>51.</ref><ref name="Claws p114">Braybrook 1982, p.114.</ref>

Development of the N-156F continued at a lower priority as a private venture by Northrop, which was rewarded by an order for three prototypes on 25 February 1958 as a prospective low cost fighter that could be supplied under the [[Military Assistance Program]] for distribution to less-developed nations.  The first N-156F flew at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] on 30 July 1959, exceeding the [[Supersonic#Supersonic flight|speed of sound]] on its first flight.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p51">Lake and Hewson 1996, p.51.</ref>

Although testing of the N-156F was successful, demonstrating unprecedented reliability and proving superior in the ground-attack role to the USAF's existing [[F-100 Super Sabre]]s, official interest in the Northrop type waned, and by 1960 it looked as if the program was a failure.  Interest revived in 1961, however, when the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] tested it, (along with the [[A-4 Skyhawk]] and [[Fiat G.91]]) for reconnaissance and close-support, but although all three types proved capable during Army testing, operating fixed-wing combat aircraft was legally the responsibility of the Air Force, which would neither agree to operate the N-156 nor to allow the Army to operate fixed-wing combat aircraft (a situation repeated with the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|C-7 Caribou]]).<ref name="Harding army">Harding 1990, pp. 118<U+2013>119, 122<U+2013>123, 188<U+2013>189.</ref>  In 1962, however, the [[Kennedy Administration]] revived the requirement for a low-cost export fighter, selecting the N-156F as winner of the F-X competition on 23 April 1962 subsequently becoming the '''F-5A''', being ordered into production in October that year.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p52-3">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref> It was named under the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]] which included a re-set of the fighter number series (the General Dynamics [[F-111]] was the highest sequentially numbered P/F-aircraft to enter service under the old number sequence).

Northrop built 636 F-5As (including the YF-5A prototype) before production ended in 1972. These were accompanied by 200 two-seat '''F-5B''' aircraft. These were operational trainers, lacking the nose-mounted cannon but otherwise combat-capable, while 86 RF-5A reconnaissance variants of the F-5A, fitted with a four camera nose were also built.  In addition Canadair built 240 first generation F-5s under license, with [[CASA]] in Spain adding a further 70 aircraft.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p82-3">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref>

===F-5E and F-5F Tiger II===
[[File:Northrop F-5E (Tail No. 11419) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Early series F-5E]]

In 1970 Northrop won a competition for an improved '''International Fighter Aircraft (IFA)''' to replace the F-5A, with better air-to-air performance against aircraft like the Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21]]. The resultant aircraft, initially known as '''F-5A-21''', subsequently became the '''F-5E'''. It had more powerful (5,000&nbsp;lbf) [[General Electric J85]]-21 engines, and had a lengthened and enlarged fuselage, accommodating more fuel.  Its wings were fitted with enlarged [[leading edge extension]]s, giving an increased wing area and improved maneuverability. The aircraft's [[avionics]] were more sophisticated, crucially including a [[radar]] (initially the [[Emerson Electric]] [[AN/APQ-153]]) (the F-5A and B had no radar). It retained the gun armament of two [[M39 cannon]], one on either side of the nose) of the F-5A.  Various specific avionics fits could be accommodated at customer request, including an [[inertial navigation system]], [[TACAN]] and ECM equipment.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p58-9 70-1">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 58<U+2013>59, 70<U+2013>71.</ref>  The first F-5E flew on 11 August 1972.<ref name="Claws p116">Braybrook 1982, p. 116.</ref>

A two-seat combat-capable trainer, the '''F-5F''', was offered, first flying on 25 September 1974, with a new, longer nose, which, unlike the F-5B which did not mount a gun, allowed it to retain a single M39 cannon, albeit with a reduced ammunition capacity.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p71-2">Lake and Hewson 1996, pp. 71<U+2013>72.</ref> The two-seater was equipped with the Emerson AN/APQ-157 radar, which is a derivative of the AN/APQ-153 radar, with dual control and display systems to accommodate the two-men crew, and the radar has the same range of AN/APQ-153, around 10 [[nautical mile|nmi]]. A [[reconnaissance]] version, the '''RF-5E Tigereye''', with a sensor package in the nose displacing the radar and one cannon, was also offered. The latest radar upgrade included the Emerson [[AN/APG-69]], which was the successor of AN/APQ-159, incorporating mapping capability, however, most nations chose not to upgrade due to financial reasons, and the radar only saw very limited service in USAF aggressor squadrons and Swiss air force.

[[File:Northrop F-5E (Tail No. 11417) 061006-F-1234S-067.jpg|thumb|left|Official roll-out of first USAF F-5E Tiger-II]]

The F-5E eventually received the official name '''Tiger II'''. The F-5E experienced numerous upgrades in its service life, with the most significant one being adopting a new planar array radar, Emerson AN/APQ-159 with a range of 20&nbsp;[[nautical mile|nmi]] to replace the original AN/APQ-153. Similar radar upgrades were also proposed for '''F-5F''', with the derivative of AN/APQ-159, the AN/APQ-167, to replace the AN/APQ-157, but was never carried out.

Northrop built 792 F-5Es, 140 F-5Fs and 12 RF-5Es.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p82-3"/> More were built under license overseas: 91 F-5Es and -Fs in Switzerland;<ref name="WAPJ 25 p103">Lake and Hewson 1996, p. 103.</ref> 68 by [[Korean Air]] in South Korea,<ref name="WAPJ 25 p96">Lake and Hewson 1996, p.96.</ref> and 308 in [[Taiwan]].<ref name="WAPJ 25 p104">Lake and Hewson 1996, p. 104.</ref>

The F-5 proved to be a successful combat aircraft for US allies, but had only limited combat service with the US Air Force in Vietnam.  The F-5E evolved into the single-engine F-5G, which was rebranded the [[Northrop F-20 Tigershark|F-20 Tigershark]].  It lost out on export sales to the F-16 in the 1980s.

===Upgrades===
Various F-5 versions remain in service with many nations. [[Singapore]] has approximately 49 modernized and re-designated '''F-5S''' (single-seat) and '''F-5T''' (two-seat) aircraft. Upgrades include new FIAR Grifo-F X-band radar from Galileo Avionica (similar in performance to the [[AN/APG-69]]), updated cockpits with multi-function displays, and compatibility with the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] and [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|Rafael]] [[Python (missile)|Python]] [[air-to-air missile]]s.<ref name="FSRSAF">{{cite press release|title=Assets: Fighter aircraft|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Singaporean Ministry of Defence (MINDEF)]]|date=Last updated 24 Apr 2010|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/aircraft/fighters.html|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="AFM275">{{cite journal|last=Mike Yeo|date=March 2011|title=Tigers over Lion City|journal=[[Air Forces Monthly]]|publisher=[[Key Publishing]]|issue=issue 275|pages=pages 86<U+2013>91|issn=09557091|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="FGBRF5">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2000/04/11/64402/brazil-favours-grifo-f-radar-for-f-5br-upgrade.html|title=Brazil favours Grifo F radar for F-5BR upgrade: "The air force has test flown the Singapore air force's upgraded version of the F-5S/T, fitted with the Grifo F radar."|date=11 April 2000|work=[[Flightglobal.com]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|accessdate=8 June 2011|location=London}}</ref>

Similar programs have been carried out in Chile and Brazil with the help of [[Elbit]]. The Chilean upgrade, called the '''F-5 Tiger III Plus''', incorporated a new Elta [[EL/M-2032]] radar and other improvements. The Brazilian program, whose product is called the F-5M (Modernized), is armed with Python V coupled to the DASH helmet-mounted cue system, and new GRIFO radar, cockpit displays and navigation electronics. The Brazilian F-5M is also equipped with the Israeli Derby missile and can operate in a [[Beyond Visual Range missile|BVR]] environment. In the Cruzex 2006 multinational war games, a Brazilian F-5 made simulated kills on two French [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Dassault Mirage 2000N]] aircraft, which were supported by an [[E-3 Sentry]] and escorted by other two [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000C]]. This result was achieved by using the Derby and the information relayed by datalink from an AEW&C plane, the [[Embraer R-99]], fitted with the [[Erieye]] [[AESA]] radar.<ref>[http://www.defesanet.com.br/zz/fab_derby.htm "FAB buys Derby."] ''DefesaNet''. Retrieved: 11 September 2007.</ref>

[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]

Other upgrade programs have been carried out in [[Royal Thai Air Force]] by [[Israel]] being called the F-5T Tigris, armed with Python III and 4 (with the Dash helmet-mounted cueing system). Unlike other F-5s which have undergone updates, the RTAF aircraft cannot use [[Beyond Visual Range missile|BVR]] missiles.

One NASA F-5E was given a modified fuselage shape for its employment in the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] program carried out by [[DARPA]]. It is preserved in the Valiant Air Command Museum at [[Titusville]], Florida.

==Operational history==
===United States===
The first contract for the production F-5A was issued in 1962, the first overseas order coming from the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] on 28 February 1964. It entered service with the 4441st Combat Crew Training School of the USAF, which had the role of training pilots and ground crew for customer nations, on 30 April that year, it still not being intended that the aircraft be used in significant numbers by the USAF itself.<ref name="WAPJ 25 p53">Lake and Hewson 1996, p. 53.</ref>

[[File:F-5B 602TFS BienHoa 1966.jpg|thumb|A 602d TFS F-5B at Bien Hoa, 1966.]]

In October 1965, this changed when the USAF began a five-month combat evaluation of the F-5A titled ''Skoshi Tiger''. Twelve aircraft were delivered for trials to the [[4503rd Tactical Fighter Squadron]], and after modification with probe and drogue [[aerial refueling]] equipment, armor and improved instruments, were redesignated as the '''F-5C'''.<ref name="WoF 5 p4-6">Thompson 1996, pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref> Over the next six months, they performed combat duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], flying more than 2,600 sorties, both from the [[3d Wing|3rd Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Bien Hoa]] over [[South Vietnam]], and from [[Da Nang Air Base]] where operations were flown over [[Laos]]. One aircraft was lost in combat.<ref name="WoF 5 p12,14">Thompson 1996, pp. 12, 14.</ref> Though declared a success, with the aircraft generally as capable a ground-attack aircraft as the F-100, but suffering from a shorter range,<ref name="WoF 5 p16">Thompson 1996, p. 16.</ref> the program as much a political gesture intended to aid the export of more F-5s than a serious consideration of the type for U.S. service.<ref name="WoF 5 p4-6"/> From April 1966 the aircraft continued operations as [[10th Fighter Commando Squadron]] with their number boosted to seventeen aircraft. (Following ''Skoshi Tiger'' the [[Philippine Air Force]] acquired F-5A and B models in 1965, putting 23 into service. These aircraft, along with remanufactured [[F-8 Crusader]]s, eventually replaced the [[F-86 Sabre]] in the air defense and ground attack roles.)

[[File:F-5C VNAF 23TW 522FS BienHoa 1971.jpg|thumb|[[Vietnam Air Force|VNAF]] F-5C [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], 1971]]

In June 1967 the 10th FCS's surviving aircraft were turned over to the air force of [[South Vietnam]], which previously had only [[A-37 Dragonfly]] and [[A-1 Skyraider]] attack aircraft. This new VNAF squadron was titled the 522nd. The president of Vietnam had originally asked for F-4 Phantoms used by the Americans, but the [[VNAF]] flew primarily ground support as the communist forces employed no opposing aircraft over South Vietnam, MiG or otherwise. Ironically, when [[Bien Hoa]] was later overrun by Communist forces, several of the aircraft were captured and used operationally by the [[North Vietnamese Army|NVAF]], in particular against [[Khmer Rouge]]. In view of the performance, agility and size of the F-5, it might have appeared to be a good match against the similar [[MiG-21]] in air combat; however, US doctrine was to use heavy, faster, and longer-range aircraft like the [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[F-4 Phantom II]] over North Vietnam. Several of the F-5s left over from the Vietnam war were sent to Poland and Russia, for advanced study of US aviation technology,<ref>[http://www.muzeumlotnictwa.pl/indexen.php?mod=show_galery&idg=5 "Photo of a Northrop F-5E Tiger II in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], Poland a gift of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."] ''muzeumlotnictwa.pl''. Retrieved: 15 May 2010.</ref> while others were decommissioned and put on display at museums in Vietnam.

Although the United States does not use the F-5 in a front line role, it was adopted for an opposing forces (OPFOR) "''aggressor''" for [[dissimilar training]] role because of its small size and performance similarities to the Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]].

[[File:F-5N from VFC-111 Sundowners taxiing.jpg|thumb|left|A former Swiss F-5N in service with US Navy aggressor squadron [[VFC-111]].]]

The F-5E saw service with the US Air Force from 1975 until 1990, serving in the [[64th Aggressor Squadron]] and [[65th Aggressor Squadron]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in [[Nevada]], and with the 527th Aggressor Squadron at RAF Alconbury in the UK and the 26th Aggressor Squadron at [[Clark Air Force Base]] in the Philippines. The US Marines purchased ex-USAF models in 1989 to replace their [[IAI Kfir|F-21s]], which served with [[VMFT-401]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Yuma]]. The U.S. Navy used the F-5E extensively at the [[Naval Fighter Weapons School]] (TOPGUN) when it was located at [[NAS Miramar]], California. When TOPGUN relocated to become part of the [[Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center]] at [[NAS Fallon]], Nevada, the command divested itself of the F-5, choosing to rely on VC-13 (redesignated [[VFC-13]] and which already used F-5s) to employ their F-5s as adversary aircraft. Former adversary squadrons such as VF-43 at [[NAS Oceana]], VF-45 at [[NAS Key West]], VF-126 at NAS Miramar, and VFA-127 at [[NAS Lemoore]] have also operated the F-5 along with other aircraft types in support of Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT).

The U.S. Navy F-5 fleet continues to be modernized with 36 low-hour F-5E/Fs purchased from Switzerland in 2006. These were updated as F-5N/Fs with modernized avionics and other improved systems. Currently, the only U.S. Navy units flying the F-5 are VFC-13 at NAS Fallon, Nevada and [[VFC-111]] at [[NAS Key West]], Florida.<ref name="USN F-5N">[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1100&tid=1050&ct=1 "F-5N/F Adversary aircraft fact file."] ''US Navy''.

With the introduction of 150 F-16s, 60 Mirage 2000-5s and 130 F-CK-1s in mid to late 1990s, the F-5E/F series became second line fighters in ROCAF service and mostly are now withdrawn from service as squadrons converted to the new fighters entering ROCAF service. Seven low airframe hours F-5Es were sent to [[ST Aerospace]] to convert them to RF-5E standard to fulfill a reconnaissance role previously undertaken by the retiring RF-104G in ROCAF service.<ref>[http://www.taiwanairpower.org/af/rf5e.html "RF-5E Tigergazer."] ''taiwanairpower'', 12 June 2004.

Taiwan also tried to upgrade the F-5E/F fleet with AIDC's Tiger 2000/2001 program. The first flight took place on 24 July 2002. The program would replace the F-5E/F's radar with F-CK-1's GD-53 radar and allow the fighter to carry a single TC-2 BVRAAM on the centerline. But lack of interest from the Taiwan/ROC Air Force eventually killed the program.

The only air combat actions ROCAF F-5E/F pilots saw were not over Taiwan, but in North Yemen. In 1979, a flareup between North and South Yemen prompted the US to sell 14 F-5E/Fs to North Yemen to boost its air defense. Since no one in North Yemen knew how to fly the F-5E/F(only MiG-15 at the time), US and Saudi Arabia arranged to have 80+ ROCAF F-5E pilots(8 pilots per year) plus ground crew and anti-air defense units sent to North Yemen as part of North Yemen Air Force's 115th Squadron at Sana<U+2018>a operating initially just 6 F-5E/F and then added 8 more, from April 1979 to May 1990. The ROCAF piloted F-5E/F scored a few kills in a few air battles, but the ground early warning radar crews and anti-air units also suffered from air attacks from South Yemen, the aircraft being piloted by Soviet crews.<ref>[http://www.fpif.org/commentary/0112yemen.html "Foreign Policy in Focus, Yemen, the United States, and Al-Qaida."] ''fpif.org'', 19 December 2001.

===Iran===
[[File:F5-operation karkok.jpg|thumb|F-5As of [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]]]
The Imperial Iranian Air Force received extensive US equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. Iran received its first 11 F-5A and two F-5Bs in February 1965 which were then declared operational in June 1965. Ultimately, Iran received 104 F-5A and 23 F-5Bs by 1972. From January 1974 with the first squadron of 28 F-5Fs, Iran received a total of 166 F-5E/F and 15 additional RF-5Es with deliveries ending in 1976. While receiving the F-5E and F, Iran started selling its F-5A and Bs to other countries including Ethiopia, Turkey, Greece and South Vietnam; by 1976, they were all sold apart from some F-5Bs retained for training.

After the revolution, the new Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force was partially successful keeping Western fighters in service during the war with Iraq in the 1980s and the simple F-5 had a good service readiness until late in the war. Initially Iran took spare parts from foreign sources, later it was able to have its new aircraft industry keep the aircraft flying.<ref>[http://www.iiaf.net/aircraft/jetfighters/F5/f5.html "The first air force to receive F-5E was the Imperial Iranian Air Force."] ''iiaf.net''. Retrieved: 6 June 2010.</ref>

During the war with Iraq, IRIAF F-5s were heavily involved, flying air-to-air and air-to-ground sorties. Iranian F-5s took part in many air combats with Iraqi [[MiG-21]], [[MiG-23]], [[MiG-25]], [[Su-17|Su-20/22]], [[Mirage F-1]] and [[Super Etendard]]s scoring many victories but also suffering many losses. However the exact combat record is not known with many different claims from Iraqi, Iranian and even Western and Russian sources. Adding to the haze surrounding the F-5's combat record is that many of the IRIAF's confirmed air-to-air kills were, for political reasons, attributed to the [[Revolutionary Guards]]. Nonetheless there are reports that an F-5E, piloted by Major [[Yadollah Javadpour]], managed to shoot down a [[MiG-25]] on 6 August 1983.<ref>[http://www.iiaf.net/iiafmisc/announcements/announcements.html IRIAF] ''iiaf.net''.

Retrieved: 15 May 2010.</ref> Additionally, his five claimed aerial victories, with two confirmed kills make Javadpour an ace and the most successful F-5 pilot.

From a general standpoint, during the first years of service, Iranian F-5 fighter aircraft had the advantage in missile technology, using advanced versions of the IR seeking Sidewinder, later lost with deliveries of new missiles and fighters to Iraq.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/air-force-equipment-intro.htm "Iraqi Air Force Equipment <U+2013> Introduction."] ''globalsecurity.org''.

Iran currently produces an indigenous aircraft titled, "[[Saegeh]]", which is built on the same platform as the F-5.

===Ethiopia===
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2008}}

[[Ethiopia]] received 10 F-5As and two F-5Bs from the US starting in 1966. In addition to these, Ethiopia had a training squadron equipped with at least eight [[T-33 Shooting Star]]s. In 1970, Iran transferred at least three F-5As and Bs to Ethiopia. In 1975, another agreement was reached with the US to deliver a number of military aircraft, including 14 F-5Es and three F-5Fs; later in the same year eight F-5Es were transferred while the others were embargoed and delivered to a USAF aggressor Squadron due to the changed political situation. The US also withdrew its personnel and cut diplomatic relations. Ethiopian officers contracted a number of Israelis to maintain American equipment.

The Ethiopian F-5 fighters saw combat action against Somali forces during the [[Ogaden War]] (1977<U+2013>1978). The main Somali fighter aircraft was the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]MF delivered in the 1970s, supported by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]]s delivered in the 1960s by the [[Soviet Union]].

Ethiopian F-5E aircraft were used to gain air superiority because they could use the [[AIM-9]]B air to air missile, while the F-5As were kept for [[air interdiction]] and [[air strike]]. During this period Ethiopian F-5Es went on training against Ethiopian F-5As and [[F-86 Sabre]]s (simulating Somali MiG-21s and MiG-17s).

On 17 July 1977, two Ethiopian F-5s were on combat air patrol near Harer, when four Somali MiG-21MFs were detected nearby. In the engagement, two MiG-21s were shot down while the other two had a midair collision while avoiding a AIM-9B missile. The better-trained [[Ethiopian Air Force]] F-5 pilots swiftly gained air superiority over the [[Somali Air Force]], shooting down a number of aircraft, while other Somali aircraft were lost to air defense and to incidents. However at least three F-5s were shot down by air defense forces during attacks against supply bases in western Somalia.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_188.shtml "Ethiopia."] ''acig.org''.

===Morocco===
F-5As and F-5Bs took part in the [[Morocco-Polisario war|Polisario War]] in [[Western Sahara]] in the 1980s. During the war, the [[Polisario Front]] was aided by East European, Cuban and Algerian advisers. They were armed with heavy weapons and even with sophisticated heavy SA-6 anti-aircraft systems. Some 14 F-5s were lost during combat. A total of 24 F-5Es have been upgraded to F-5TIII standard.<ref>[http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/jet%20age/morocco.htm "Morocco."] ''century-of-flight.net'', 2003.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has decommissioned their remaining F-5A/B fleet that were transferred from Taiwan and South Korea. But 6-8 remain in flyable condition in case of a national emergency, and 2 of those F-5's were upgraded

===Singapore===
Singapore is an enthusiastic operator of the F-5E/F variant, first ordering the aircraft in 1976 during a massive expansion of the city-state's armed forces; delivery of this first batch of 18 F-5Es and 3 F-5Fs was completed by late February 1979, equipping the newly formed-up [[144 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|No. 144 '''Black Kite''' Squadron]] at [[Tengah Air Base]]. At the end of 1979, an order was placed for 6 more F-5Es, these were was delivered by 1981. In 1982, an order for 3 more F-5Fs was placed, these were forward delivered in September 1983 to [[RAF Leuchars]] in Scotland where they were taken over by pilots of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] (RSAF).<ref name="AFM275"/> In 1983, the type took over the duties of [[Interceptor aircraft|airborne interception]] from RAAF's [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage IIIO]]s detachment stationed at ''Tengah''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=David|title=Seek and Strike: 75 Squadron RAAF 1942<U+2013>2002|year=2002|publisher=Banner Books|location=Maryborough|isbn=1875593233|page=180}}</ref>

Another order for 6 more F-5Es was placed in 1985, these were delivered the same year and would go on to equipped the newly formed-up [[149 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|No. 149 '''Shikra''' Squadron]] at ''Tengah''. The following year, the RSAF placed an order for its final batch of 3 F-5Fs and 5 F-5Es, these were delivered in December 1987 and July 1989, respectively. In a bid to modernise their air force, the Royal Jordanian Air Force put up 7 F-5Es for sale in 1994, these were later acquired by Singapore.<ref name="AFM275"/>

[[File:RSAF F-5 preparing to take off.jpg|thumb|An F-5S belonging to [[144 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force]] prepares for takeoff]]

From 1990 to 1991, using jigs and toolings purchased from Northrop, Singapore Aircraft Industries ('''SAI''', now [[ST Aerospace]]) converted 8 existing F-5Es into RF-5E Tigereye variant. Subsequently, these were used to requipped [[141 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|No. 141 '''Merlin''' Squadron]], which had traded in their older [[Hawker Hunter]] FR.74S for the newer Tigereyes in 1992 and was by then based at [[Paya Lebar Air Base]], after the 144 Squadron had relocated there in 1986. By June 1993, all three squadrons had been relocated to the base, thus consolidating Singapore's F-5E/F operations at ''Paya Lebar''.<ref name="AFM275"/>

In late 1991, SAI was further awarded a contract by RSAF to mordernise and upgrade all the F-5E/F in RSAF's inventory (including the 7 ex-Jordanian F-5Es), with main-sub contractor [[Elbit Systems]] responsible for systems integration. Included in the package was a new [[X band]] multi-mode radar (the Italian '''FIAR Grifo-F'''<ref name="FSRSAF"/><ref name="FGBRF5"/>, with [[Beyond-visual-range missile]] and [[Look-down/shoot-down]] capabilities), a revamped cockpit with new MIL-STD-1553R databuses, [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]/[[Ferranti]] 4510 [[Head-up display]]/weapons delivery system, two [[BAE Systems]] MED-2067 [[Multi-function display]]s, [[Litton Industries|Litton]] LN-93 [[inertial navigation system]] (similar to all those found on [[ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk]]s) and [[HOTAS|Hands On Throttle-And-Stick controls (HOTAS)]] to reduce pilot wordload. Reportedly, the Elisra SPS2000 [[radar warning receiver]] and countermeasure system was also installed. Additionally, the starboard M-39 20mm cannon mounted in the nose was removed to make way for additional avionics (the sole cannon fitted to the two-seaters was removed because of this), and to improve manoeuvrability, all the upgraded aircraft were also fitted with larger [[Leading edge extension#Leading edge root extensions (LERX)|leading edge root extensions (LERX)]]. The process of rebuilding and upgrading began in March 1996 and was completed by 2001. As a result, they received the new designation of F-5S/T. In 1998, the 8 RF-5Es were also upgraded, recieving the full upgrade except for the radar, these were later redesignated as RF-5S.<ref name="AFM275"/>

By end of 2009, the type had accumulated more than 170,000 hours of flght hours in Singapore service with only 2 F-5Es being lost in separate accidents (in 1984 and 1991, respectively).<ref name="AFM275"/> In a 2009 interview by the air force's newsletter, Singapore's former Chief of Air Force and F-5 pilot, Major General [[Ng Chee Khern]] commented that: {{quotation|"The F-5 earned a reputation of a jet that was hard to discern in the air and when one finally saw it, it was often after a missile or guns kill had already been called.<ref name="AFM275"/>}}

As of June 2011, only 141 and 144 Squadron are left operating the RF-5S and F-5S/T, as 149 Squadron has since formally transitioned to the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle#F-15SG|McDonnell Douglas F-15SG Strike Eagle]]s on 5 April 2010.<ref name="F-15SG">{{cite press release|title=Inauguration of the RSAF's First Local F-15SG Squadron|publisher=MINDEF|date=5 April 2010|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2010/apr/05apr10_nr.html|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

===Derivatives===
====F-20 Tigershark====
{{Main|F-20 Tigershark}}

Northrop attempted to develop an advanced version of the F-5E, originally designated '''F-5G''', as an export competitor for the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. The F-5G was later redesignated the F-20 Tigershark. It received favorable reviews as a less expensive but capable alternative to early-block variants of the F-16 (and superior to the similarly never-purchased export variant F-16/[[General Electric J79|79]]), but it never had the appeal of the much newer fighter design even at a lower cost.

====Northrop YF-17====
{{Main|Northrop YF-17}}

The Northrop YF-17's aircraft's main design elements date from the F-5 based internal Northrop project N-300. The N-300 featured a longer fuselage, small leading-edge root extensions (LERX), and more powerful GE15-J1A1 turbojets. The wing was moved higher on the fuselage to increase ordnance flexibility. The N-300 further evolved into the P-530 Cobra. The P-530's wing planform and nose section was similar to the F-5, with a trapezoidal shape formed by a sweep of 20<U+00B0> at the quarter-chord line, and an unswept trailing edge, but was over double the area. While the YF-17 lost its bid for the USAF lightweight fighter, it would be developed into the larger [[F/A-18 Hornet]].

Prior to the scene of the famous line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" in the 1979 classic movie ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', four F-5 fighters were shown dropping [[napalm]] on a battlefield. These aircraft belonged to the [[Philippine Air Force]], which provided not only the F-5s, but also the UH-1H helicopters for the film. The aircraft were portrayed as American in the film.<ref>The Outside Lomcovak Club [http://www.lomcovak.com/movie_apocalypse-now.html Apocalypse Now]</ref>

''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'' (1986) features a number of F-5Es and F-5Fs in latex wash-off paint as the fictional [[Mikoyan MiG-28 (fictional)|MiG-28s]] that battle against US Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]]s.
