''G2'' means that it has a surface temperature of approximately 5,780 [[Kelvin|K]] (5,500 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]]) giving it a white color that often, because of atmospheric [[scattering]], appears yellow when seen from the surface of the Earth. This is a subtractive effect, as the [[Rayleigh scattering|preferential scattering]] of shorter [[wavelength]] light removes enough violet and blue light, leaving a range of [[frequency|frequencies]] that is perceived by the human eye as yellow. It is this scattering of light at the blue end of the [[spectrum]] that gives the surrounding sky its color. When the Sun is low in the sky, even more light is scattered so that the Sun appears [[orange (color)|orange]] or even [[red]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blue.html | title=Why is the sky blue? | work=Voorhees, NJ, USA: Science Made Simple, Inc. | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref>

The Sun's spectrum contains [[spectral line|line]]s of ionized and neutral metals as well as very weak hydrogen lines. The ''V'' ([[Roman numerals|Roman five]]) in the spectral class indicates that the Sun, like most stars, is a [[main sequence]] star. This means that it generates its energy by [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen nuclei into helium. There are more than 100 million G2 class stars in our galaxy.

The Sun orbits the center of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] at a distance of approximately 24,000 to 26,000 [[light-year|light years]] from the [[galactic center]], moving generally in the direction of [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] and completing one revolution in about 225<U+2013>250 million years (one [[Galactic year]]).

The Sun is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]] in the low-density [[Local Bubble]] zone of diffuse high-temperature gas, in the inner rim of the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way Galaxy, between the larger [[Perseus arm|Perseus]] and [[Sagittarius arm]]s of the galaxy.

This is suggested by a high [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]] of [[heavy metals|heavy elements]] such as [[gold]] and [[uranium]] in the [[Solar System]] relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called [[metallicity#Population II stars|Population II]] (heavy element-poor) stars. These elements could most plausibly have been produced by [[endergonic]] nuclear reactions during a [[supernova]], or by [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] via [[neutron]] absorption inside a massive second-generation star. 

Sunlight is Earth's primary source of energy. The [[solar constant]] is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1368 [[watt]]s per square meter at a distance of one [[astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth). Sunlight on the surface of Earth is [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuated]] by the Earth's atmosphere so that less power arrives at the surface&mdash;closer to 1,000 watts per directly exposed square meter in clear conditions when the Sun is near the [[zenith]]. This energy can be harnessed via a variety of natural and synthetic processes&mdash;[[photosynthesis]] by plants captures the energy of sunlight and converts it to chemical form (oxygen and reduced carbon compounds), while direct heating or electrical conversion by [[solar cells]] are used by solar power equipment to generate electricity or to do other useful work. The energy stored in [[petroleum]] and other fossil fuels was originally converted from sunlight by [[photosynthesis]] in the distant past.

[[Ultraviolet]] light from the Sun has [[antiseptic]] properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. It also causes sunburn, and has other medical effects such as the production of [[Vitamin D]]. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's [[ozone layer]], so that the amount of UV varies greatly with [[latitude]] and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human [[skin color]] in different regions of the globe.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000027 | title=What Controls Variation in Human Skin Color? | year=2003 | author=Barsh, Gregory S. | journal=PLoS Biology | volume=1 | pages=e7}}</ref>

Observed from Earth, the Sun's path across the sky varies throughout the year. The shape described by the Sun's position, considered at the same time each day for a complete year, is called the [[analemma]] and resembles a figure 8 aligned along a north/south axis. While the most obvious variation in the Sun's apparent position through the year is a north/south swing over 47 degrees of angle (because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth with respect to the Sun), there is an east/west component as well, caused by the acceleration of the Earth as it approaches its [[perihelion]] with the Sun, and the reduction in the Earth's speed as it moves away to approach its [[aphelion]]. The north/south swing in apparent angle is the main source of [[seasons]] on Earth.

A rare [[optical phenomenon]] may occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, known as a [[green flash]]. The flash is caused by light from the sun just below the horizon being [[refraction|bent]] (usually through a [[temperature inversion]]) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] more, leaving light that is perceived as [[green]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/greenflash.shtml | title= The Green Flash | work=BBC Weather Centre | accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref>

The Sun is a magnetically active star. It supports a strong, changing [[magnetic field]] that varies year-to-year and reverses direction about every eleven years around solar maximum. The Sun's magnetic field gives rise to many effects that are collectively called [[solar variation|solar activity]], including [[sunspot]]s on the surface of the Sun, [[solar flares]], and variations in [[solar wind]] that carry material through the Solar System. Effects of solar activity on Earth include [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s at moderate to high latitudes, and the disruption of radio communications and [[electric power]]. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]]. Solar activity changes the structure of Earth's [[ionosphere|outer atmosphere]].

Although it is the nearest star to Earth and has been intensively studied by scientists, many questions about the Sun remain unanswered. Current topics of scientific inquiry include the Sun's regular cycle of sunspot activity, the physics and origin of [[solar flare|flares]] and [[solar prominence|prominences]], the magnetic interaction between the [[chromosphere]] and the [[corona]], and the origin (propulsion source) of solar wind.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

The Apex of the Sun's Way, or the [[solar apex]], is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way. The general direction of the Sun's galactic motion is towards the star [[Vega]] near the constellation of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the [[Galactic Center]]. The Sun's orbit around the Galaxy is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions.

This is very similar to how a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] works with no drag force (damping) term.

Each second, more than 4 million [[tonne]]s of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing [[neutrino]]s and [[solar radiation]]; at this rate, the Sun will have so far converted around 100 Earth-masses of matter into energy.

As the Sun exists in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasmatic state]] and is not solid, it rotates faster at its [[equator]] than at its [[poles]].  This behavior is known as differential [[Solar rotation|rotation]]. The period of this ''actual rotation'' is approximately 25 days at the equator and 35 days at the poles.  However, due to our constantly changing vantage point from the Earth as it orbits the Sun, the ''apparent rotation'' of the star at its equator is about 28 days.  The centrifugal effect of this slow rotation is 18 million times weaker than the surface gravity at the Sun's equator. The tidal effect of the planets is even weaker, and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.

The Sun does not have a definite boundary as rocky planets do, and in its outer parts the density of its gases drops approximately [[exponential distribution|exponentially]] with increasing distance from its center. Nevertheless, it has a well-defined interior structure, described below. The Sun's radius is measured from its center to the edge of the [[photosphere]]. This is simply the layer above which the gases are too cool or too thin to radiate a significant amount of light, and is therefore the surface most readily visible to the [[naked eye]].

The solar interior is not directly observable, and the Sun itself is opaque to [[electromagnetic radiation]]. However, just as [[seismology]] uses waves generated by earthquakes to reveal the interior structure of the Earth, the discipline of [[helioseismology]] makes use of pressure waves ([[infrasound]]) traversing the Sun's interior to measure and visualize the star's inner structure. [[Computer modeling]] of the Sun is also used as a theoretical tool to investigate its deeper layers.

===Core===
{{main|Solar core}}
[[File:Sun parts big.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cross-section of a solar-type star ([[NASA]])]]
The [[Solar core|core]] of the Sun is considered to extend from the center to about 0.2 solar radii.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1140598|year=2007|month=Jun|author=Garc<U+00ED>a, Ra; Turck-Chi<U+00E8>ze, S; Jim<U+00E9>nez-Reyes, Sj; Ballot, J; Pall<U+00E9>, Pl; Eff-Darwich, A; Mathur, S; Provost, J|title=Tracking solar gravity modes: the dynamics of the solar core.|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1591<U+2013>3|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17478682|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)}}</ref> It has a density of up to 150,000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (150 times the density of water on Earth) and a temperature of close to 13,600,000 [[kelvin]]s (by contrast, the surface of the Sun is around 5,800 kelvins). Recent analysis of [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the rest of the radiative zone.<ref>Garcia R. A. et al. "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/316/5831/1591 Tracking Solar Gravity Modes: The Dynamics of the Solar Core]", ''[[Science]]'', [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], '''316''', 5831, 1591 - 1593 (2007)</ref> Through most of the Sun's life, energy is produced by [[nuclear fusion]] through a series of steps called the [[Proton-proton chain reaction|p<U+2013>p (proton<U+2013>proton) chain]]; this process converts hydrogen into helium. The core is the only location in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of heat via fusion: the rest of the star is heated by energy that is transferred outward from the core. All of the energy produced by fusion in the core must travel through many successive layers to the solar photosphere before it escapes into space as sunlight or [[kinetic energy]] of particles.

About 3.4{{e|38}} [[proton]]s (hydrogen nuclei) are converted into helium nuclei every second (out of ~8.9{{e|56}} total amount of free protons in the Sun), releasing energy at the matter<U+2013>energy conversion rate of 4.26 million metric tons per second, 383 [[Yotta-|yotta]][[watt]]s (3.83{{e|26}} W) or 9.15{{e|10}} [[megaton]]s of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] per second. This actually corresponds to a surprisingly low rate of energy production in the Sun's core<U+2014>about 0.3 W/m<sup>3</sup> (watts per cubic meter).  This is less power than generated by a candle.  Power density is about 6 <U+00B5>W/kg of matter. For comparison, the human body produces heat at approximately the rate 1.2 W/kg, roughly a million times greater per unit mass. The use of plasma with similar parameters for energy production on Earth would be completely impractical<U+2014>even a modest 1 GW fusion power plant would require about 170 billion metric ton of plasma occupying almost one cubic mile. Hence, terrestrial fusion reactors utilize far higher plasma temperatures than those in Sun's interior.

The rate of nuclear fusion depends strongly on density and temperature, so the fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and [[thermal expansion|expand]] slightly against the [[weight]] of the outer layers, reducing the fusion rate and correcting the [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present level.

The high-energy [[photon]]s (gamma rays) released in [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions are absorbed in only a few millimeters of solar plasma and then re-emitted again in random direction (and at slightly lower energy)<U+2014>so it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the "photon travel time" range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.<ref name="NASA">{{cite web

|title=The 8-minute travel time to Earth by sunlight hides a thousand-year journey that actually began in the core
}}</ref>

After a final trip through the convective outer layer to the transparent "surface" of the photosphere, the photons escape as [[visible light]]. Each gamma ray in the Sun's core is converted into several million visible light photons before escaping into space. [[Neutrino]]s are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were [[Solar neutrino problem|lower than theories predicted]] by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was recently resolved through the discovery of the effects of [[neutrino oscillation]]: the Sun in fact emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2/3 of them because the neutrinos had changed [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]].{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

===Radiative zone===
From about 0.2 to about 0.7 solar radii, solar material is hot and dense enough that [[thermal radiation]] is sufficient to transfer the intense heat of the core outward. In this zone there is no thermal [[convection]]; while the material grows cooler as altitude increases, this [[temperature gradient]] is less than the value of [[adiabatic lapse rate]] and hence cannot drive convection. Heat is transferred by [[radiation]]&mdash;[[ions]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] emit [[photons]], which travel a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.  In this way energy makes its way very slowly (see above) outward.

Between the radiative zone and the convection zone is a transition layer called the [[tachocline]]. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear&mdash;a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.

===Convection zone===

In the Sun's outer layer (down to approximately 70% of the solar radius), the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. As a result, thermal convection occurs as [[thermal|thermal columns]] carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone. [[Convective overshoot]] is thought to occur at the base of the convection zone, carrying turbulent downflows into the outer layers of the radiative zone.

The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun, in the form of the [[granule (solar physics)|solar granulation]] and [[supergranulation]]. The turbulent convection of this outer part of the solar interior gives rise to a "small-scale" dynamo that produces magnetic north and south poles all over the surface of the Sun.

The Sun's thermal columns are [[B<U+00E9>nard cells]] and therefore tend to be hexagonal prisms.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

===Photosphere===
[[File:EffectiveTemperature 300dpi e.png|thumb|The [[effective temperature]], or [[black body]] temperature, of the Sun (5777 K) is the temperature a black body of the same size must have to yield the same total emissive power.]]

The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. 
The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H<sup>-</sup> ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with [[hydrogen]] atoms to produce H<sup>-</sup> ions.<ref name="Gibson">{{cite book

The photosphere is actually tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, being slightly less opaque than [[air]] on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or ''limb'' of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as [[limb darkening]]. Sunlight has approximately a [[black-body]] spectrum that indicates its temperature is about 6,000 [[kelvin|K]], interspersed with atomic [[absorption line]]s from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of about 10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup> (this is about 1% of the particle density of [[Earth's atmosphere]] at sea level).

During early studies of the [[optical spectrum]] of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any [[chemical element]]s then known on Earth. In 1868, [[Norman Lockyer]] hypothesized that these absorption lines were because of a new element which he dubbed "[[helium]]", after the Greek Sun god [[Helios]]. It was not until 25 years later that helium was isolated on Earth.<ref name="Lockyer">{{cite web

===Atmosphere===
{{main|Corona|Coronal loop}}
[[File:Solar eclips 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|During a total [[solar eclipse]], the solar [[corona]] can be seen with the naked eye.]]
The parts of the Sun above the photosphere are referred to collectively as the ''solar atmosphere''. They can be viewed with telescopes operating across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from radio through visible light to [[gamma rays]], and comprise five principal zones: the ''temperature minimum'', the [[chromosphere]], the [[solar transition region|transition region]], the [[corona]], and the [[heliosphere]]. The heliosphere, which may be considered the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun, extends outward past the orbit of [[Pluto]] to the [[heliopause]], where it forms a sharp [[shock wave|shock front]] boundary with the [[interstellar medium]]. The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun. The reason why has not been conclusively proven; evidence suggests that [[Alfv<U+00E9>n wave]]s may have enough energy to heat the corona.<ref>{{cite journal |last=De Pontieu |first=Bart |coauthors= ''et al.'' |date=[[2007-12-07]] |title=Chromospheric Alfv<U+00E9>nic Waves Strong Enough to Power the Solar Wind |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=318 |issue=5856 |pages=1574<U+2013>77 |doi=10.1126/science.1151747 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5856/1574 |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |accessdate= 2008-01-22 |pmid=18063784 }}</ref>

The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region about 500&nbsp;km above the photosphere, with a temperature of about 4,000 [[Kelvin|K]]. This part of the Sun is cool enough to support simple molecules such as [[carbon monoxide]] and water, which can be detected by their absorption spectra.

Above the temperature minimum layer is a thin layer about 2,500&nbsp;km thick,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/sun.html |title=The Sun - Introduction |work=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]]|publisher=[[NASA]] |quote=chromosphere is about 2500 km thick |accessdate=2008-11-28}}</ref> dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines. It is called the ''chromosphere'' from the Greek root ''chroma'', meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of [[solar eclipse|total eclipses of the Sun]]. The temperature in the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 100,000 K near the top.

[[File:171879main LimbFlareJan12 lg.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Taken by [[Hinode]]'s Solar Optical Telescope on January 12, 2007, this image of the Sun reveals the filamentary nature of the plasma connecting regions of different magnetic polarity.]]

Above the chromosphere is a [[solar transition region|transition region]] in which the temperature rises rapidly from around 100,000 [[kelvin|K]] to coronal temperatures closer to one million K. The increase is because of a [[phase transition]] as [[helium]] within the region becomes fully [[ionization|ionized]] by the high temperatures. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|nimbus]] around chromospheric features such as [[Spicule (solar physics)|spicule]]s and [[Solar filament|filament]]s, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from [[outer space|space]] by instruments sensitive to the [[ultraviolet|far ultraviolet]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]].

The [[corona]] is the extended outer atmosphere of the Sun, which is much larger in volume than the Sun itself. The corona merges smoothly with the [[solar wind]] that fills the [[Solar System]] and [[heliosphere]]. The low corona, which is very near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density of 10<sup>14</sup>&ndash;10<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>. (Earth's atmosphere near sea level has a particle density of about 2{{e|25}}&nbsp;m<sup>&minus;3</sup>.) The temperature of the corona is several million kelvins. While no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from [[magnetic reconnection]].

The [[heliosphere]] extends from approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU) to the outer fringes of the Solar System. Its inner boundary is defined as the layer in which the flow of the [[solar wind]] becomes ''superalfv<U+00E9>nic''&mdash;that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfv<U+00E9>n waves.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Turbulence and dynamic forces outside this boundary cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv<U+00E9>n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a [[Parker spiral|spiral]] shape, until it impacts the [[heliopause]] more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the [[Voyager program|Voyager 1 probe]] passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause. Both of the Voyager probes have recorded higher levels of energetic particles as they approach the boundary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16394 |title=The Distortion of the Heliosphere: our Interstellar Magnetic Compass |date=[[2005-03-15]] |author=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=2006-03-22}}</ref>

== Chemical composition ==

The Sun is composed primarily of the [[chemical element]]s [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively.<ref name=lodders>{{cite journal | doi= 10.1086/375492 | title= Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements | year= 2003 | author= Lodders, Katharina | journal= The Astrophysical Journal | volume= 591 | pages= 1220}}</ref> All heavier elements, called ''[[metallicity|metals]]'' in astronomy, account for less than 2&nbsp;percent of the mass. The most abundant metals are oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%).<ref name=hkt2004>{{anchor|CITEREFHansenKawalerTrimble2004}}{{cite book | last=Hansen | first=C.

The Sun inherited its chemical composition from the [[interstellar medium]] out of which it formed: the hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]. The metals were produced by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] in generations of stars which completed their [[stellar evolution]] and returned their material to the interstellar medium prior to the formation of the Sun.<ref name=hkt2004_78>{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=pp. 77&ndash;78}}.</ref> The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.<ref name="aller1968">{{cite journal | last=Aller | first=L.

Therefore, the photosphere now contains slightly less helium and only 84% of the heavy elements than the protostellar Sun did; the protostellar Sun was 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% metals.<ref name=lodders /><ref name=lodders_meteoritics>{{cite journal | author=Lodders, Katharina | year=2003 | journal= Meteoritics & Planetary Science | title= Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements | volume=38 | pages=5272 | url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2003/pdf/5272.pdf | format=PDF | bibcode=2003M&PSA..38.5272L }}</ref>

In the inner portions of the Sun, nuclear fusion has modified the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost portion of the Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the metal abundance unchanged. Because the interior of the Sun is radiative, not convective (see [[#Structure|Structure]] above), none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere.<ref name=hkt2004_9.2.3>{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=&sect; 9.2.3}}.</ref>

The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in [[meteorites]] that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and thus not affected by settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.<ref name=basu2008 />

==Solar cycles==
{{Main|Sunspots}}
===Sunspots and the sunspot cycle===

[[File:Solar-cycle-data.png|thumb|right|Measurements of solar cycle variation during the last 30 years]]

When observing the Sun with appropriate filtration, the most immediately visible features are usually its [[sunspot]]s, which are well-defined surface areas that appear darker than their surroundings because of lower temperatures. Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where [[convection]] is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, reducing energy transport from the hot interior to the surface. The magnetic field gives rise to strong heating in the corona, forming [[active region]]s that are the source of intense [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.

[[File:Mass eject in ultraviolet light.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coronal mass ejection]]s blast filaments and bubbles of magnetic plasma into space as seen in this [[ultra-violet]] light picture taken by [[Solar and heliospheric observatory|SOHO]].]]
The number of sunspots visible on the Sun is not constant, but varies over an 11-year cycle known as the [[solar cycle]]. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none at all can be seen. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the sunspot cycle progresses, the number of sunspots increases and they move closer to the equator of the Sun, a phenomenon described by [[Sp<U+00F6>rer's law]]. Sunspots usually exist as pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. The magnetic polarity of the leading sunspot alternates every solar cycle, so that it will be a north magnetic pole in one solar cycle and a south magnetic pole in the next.
[[File:Sunspot-number.png|thumb|right|History of the number of observed sunspots during the last 250 years, which shows the ~11-year solar cycle]]

The solar cycle has a great influence on [[space weather]], and is a significant influence on the Earth's climate [[Sun#Gallery|since luminosity has a direct relationship with magnetic activity]]. Solar activity minima tend to be correlated with colder temperatures, and longer than average solar cycles tend to be correlated with hotter temperatures. In the 17th century, the solar cycle appears to have stopped entirely for several decades; very few sunspots were observed during this period. During this era, which is known as the [[Maunder minimum]] or [[Little Ice Age]], Europe experienced very cold temperatures.<ref name="Lean">{{cite journal

A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun which cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years. These could provide a better explanation of the [[ice age]]s than the [[Milankovitch cycles]].<ref>

===Solar neutrino problem===
{{main|Solar neutrino problem}}
For many years the number of solar [[electron neutrino]]s detected on Earth was one third to one half of the number predicted by the [[standard solar model]]. This anomalous result was termed the [[solar neutrino problem]]. Theories proposed to resolve the problem either tried to reduce the temperature of the Sun's interior to explain the lower neutrino flux, or posited that electron neutrinos could [[neutrino oscillation|oscillate]]<U+2014>that is, change into undetectable [[tau neutrino|tau]] and [[muon neutrino]]s as they traveled between the Sun and the Earth.<ref name="Haxton">{{cite journal

This proportion agrees with that predicted by the [[MSW effect|Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect]] (also known as the matter effect), which describes neutrino oscillation in matter.  Hence, the problem is now resolved.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

===Coronal heating problem===
{{main|Corona}}
The optical surface of the Sun (the [[photosphere]]) is known to have a temperature of approximately 6,000 [[Kelvin|K]]. Above it lies the solar corona at a temperature of 1,000,000&nbsp;K. The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat [[Heat conduction|conduction]] from the photosphere.

It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is [[wave]] heating, in which sound, gravitational and magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat. The other is [[magnetic field|magnetic]] heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through [[magnetic reconnection]] in the form of large [[solar flare]]s and myriad similar but smaller events.<ref name="Alfven">{{cite journal

===Faint young Sun problem===
{{main|Faint young Sun paradox}}

Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the [[Archean|Archean period]], the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on the Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that the Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and in fact that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. The consensus among scientists is that the young Earth's atmosphere contained much larger quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and/or [[ammonia]]) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the lesser amount of [[solar energy]] reaching the planet.<ref name="Kasting">{{cite journal

==Magnetic field==
{{seealso|Stellar magnetic field}}
[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|thumb|right|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] extends to the outer reaches of the Solar System, and results from the influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the [[interplanetary medium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wso.stanford.edu/#MeanField |title=The Mean Magnetic Field of the Sun |publisher=The Wilcox Solar Observatory |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>]]

All matter in the Sun is in the form of [[gas]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] because of its high temperatures. This makes it possible for the Sun to rotate faster at its equator (about 25 days) than it does at higher latitudes (about 35 days near its poles). The [[solar rotation|differential rotation]] of the Sun's latitudes causes its [[magnetic field]] lines to become twisted together over time, causing [[Coronal loop|magnetic field loops]] to erupt from the Sun's surface and trigger the formation of the Sun's dramatic [[sunspot]]s and [[solar prominence]]s (see [[magnetic reconnection]]). This twisting action gives rise to the [[solar dynamo]] and an 11-year [[sunspot cycle|solar cycle]] of magnetic activity as the Sun's magnetic field reverses itself about every 11 years.

The influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the [[interplanetary medium]] creates the [[heliospheric current sheet]], which separates regions with magnetic fields pointing in different directions. The plasma in the interplanetary medium is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's 10<sup>-4</sup> [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic dipole field would reduce with the cube of the distance to about 10<sup>-11</sup> tesla. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around 10<sup>-9</sup> tesla. The dipole field of the sun is roughly the same as the [[earth's magnetic field]], but it extends over a vastly greater volume of space.  [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (such as the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field induces electric currents, which in turn generate magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like an [[MHD dynamo]].

== History of observation ==
=== Early understanding ===
[[File:Solvogn.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Trundholm Sun chariot]] pulled by a horse is a sculpture believed to be illustrating an important part of [[Nordic Bronze Age]] mythology.]]

Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] phenomenon. [[Sun worship|Worship]] of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the [[Inca]] of [[South America]] and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]], [[Mnajdra]], Malta and at [[Stonehenge]], England); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chich<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]] in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumn [[equinox]]es. During the Roman era the winter solstice was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally "unconquered sun") which is an antecedent to [[Christmas]]. With respect to the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers considered it to be one of the seven [[planet]]s (Greek ''planetes'', "wanderer"), after which the seven days of the [[week]] are named in some languages.

=== Development of scientific understanding ===

One of the first people to offer a scientific, or philosophical explanation for the Sun, was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]], who reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]], and not the [[chariot]] of [[Helios]].{{Fact|date=February 2009}} For teaching this [[heresy]], he was imprisoned by the authorities and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], though he was later released through the intervention of [[Pericles]]. [[Eratosthenes]] might have been the first person to have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun, in the 3rd century BCE, as 149 million kilometers, roughly the same as the modern accepted figure. 

The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets move was apparently proposed by the ancient Greek [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] and some Ancient Indians (see [[Heliocentrism]]). This view was revived in the 16th century by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. In the early 17th century, the invention of the [[telescope]] permitted detailed observations of sunspots by [[Thomas Harriot]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and other astronomers. Galileo made some of the first known Western observations of sunspots and posited that they were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between the Earth and the Sun.<ref>{{cite web

|publisher=BBC
|accessdate=2006-03-22}}</ref> Sunspots were also observed since the [[Han dynasty]] and Chinese astronomers maintained records of these observations for centuries.   
In 1672 [[Giovanni Cassini]] and [[Jean Richer]] determined the distance to [[Mars]] and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the Sun.
[[Isaac Newton]] observed the Sun's light using a [[prism (optics)|prism]], and showed that it was made up of light of many colors,<ref>{{cite web

When expanding the spectrum of light from the Sun, there are large number of missing colors can be found.

In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. [[Lord Kelvin]] suggested that the Sun was a gradually cooling liquid body that was radiating an internal store of heat.<ref name=kelvin>{{cite journal

Unfortunately the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.<ref name=kelvin /> <!-- In XIX century, before discovery of radionuclear dating, there was no reason to suggest that Earth exists for as long as 4 billion years. -->   In 1890 [[Joseph Norman Lockyer|Joseph Lockyer]], who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.<ref>{{cite book

Not until 1904 was a substantiated solution offered. [[Ernest Rutherford]] suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested [[radioactive decay]] as the source.<ref>{{cite web

In 1920 Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.<ref>{{cite web

Finally, a seminal paper was published in 1957 by [[Margaret Burbidge]], entitled "Synthesis of the Elements in Stars".<ref>{{cite journal

The first satellites designed to observe the Sun were [[NASA]]'s [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]s 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of the [[Earth]], and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long period of time, transmitting data until 1987.<ref>{{cite web

In the 1970s, [[Helios probes|Helios 1]] and the [[Skylab]] [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 satellite was a joint U.S.-German probe that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit at [[perihelion]]. The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar [[observatory]] module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station. Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona. Discoveries included the first observations of [[coronal mass ejection]]s, then called "coronal transients", and of [[coronal hole]]s, now known to be intimately associated with the [[solar wind]].

In 1980, the [[Solar Maximum Mission]] was launched by [[NASA]]. This spacecraft was designed to observe [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s and [[UV]] radiation from [[solar flare]]s during a time of high solar activity and [[Sun#External Links|solar luminosity]]. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entering]] the Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.<ref>{{cite web

Japan's [[Yohkoh]] (''Sunbeam'') satellite, launched in 1991, observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares, and also demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an [[solar eclipse|annular eclipse]] in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun.  It was destroyed by atmospheric reentry in 2005.<ref>{{cite web

One of the most important solar missions to date has been the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]], jointly built by the [[European Space Agency]] and [[NASA]] and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally a two-year mission, SOHO has now operated for over ten years (as of 2007). It has proved so useful that a follow-on mission, the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]], is planned for launch in 2008. Situated at the [[Lagrangian point]] between the Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. In addition to its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of large numbers of comets, mostly very tiny [[sungrazing comet]]s which incinerate as they pass the Sun.<ref>{{cite web

All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The [[Ulysses probe]] was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to [[Jupiter]], to "slingshot" past the planet into an orbit which would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Serendipitously, it was well-placed to observe the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with Jupiter in 1994. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750&nbsp;km/s which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes which scattered galactic [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref>{{cite web

Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A [[solar wind]] sample return mission, [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]], was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material. Genesis returned to Earth in 2004 but was damaged by a crash landing after its [[parachute]] failed to deploy on reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite severe damage, some usable samples have been recovered from the spacecraft's sample return module and are undergoing analysis.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ([[STEREO]]) mission was launched in October 2006.  Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind the Earth. This enables [[stereoscopic]] imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as [[coronal mass ejections]].

If one were to observe it from [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest star system, the Sun would appear to be in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]].<ref>{{cite web | title= APOD: The Milky Way Near the Southern Cross | url= http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070517.html| work= Yuri Beletsky| publisher= [[NASA]]| date= 2007-05-17|  accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>

Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating [[optics]] such as [[binoculars]] is very hazardous without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. An [[neutral density filter|attenuating (ND) filter]] might not filter UV and so is still dangerous. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver over 500 times as much energy to the retina as using the naked eye, killing retinal cells almost instantly (even though the power per unit area of image on the retina is the same, the heat cannot dissipate fast enough because the image is larger). Even brief glances at the midday Sun through unfiltered binoculars can cause permanent blindness.<ref name="Marsh">{{cite journal

Partial [[solar eclipse]]s are hazardous to view because the eye's [[pupil]] is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view, ''not'' by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the [[Moon]] passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same [[surface brightness]] as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2&nbsp;mm to ~6&nbsp;mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives about ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun.

During [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], sunlight is attenuated due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie theory|Mie scattering]] from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere and the direct Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.

Attenuating filters to view the Sun should be specifically designed for that use: some improvised filters pass UV or IR rays that can harm the eye at high brightness levels. Filters on telescopes or binoculars should be on the [[objective lens]] or [[aperture]], ''never'' on the [[eyepiece]], because eyepiece filters can suddenly crack or shatter due to high heat loads from the absorbed sunlight. Welding glass #14 is an acceptable solar filter, but "black" exposed photographic film is not (it passes too much infrared).

== Terminology ==
Like other natural phenomena, the Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history, and was the source of the word [[Sunday]]. The [[Latin]] name ''Sol'' ({{pronEng|s<U+0252>l}} in English) is widely known but not common in general English language use, although the adjectival form is the related word ''solar''. "Sol" is rarely used in scientific circles, and is not considered an official English name of the Sun; it makes no appearances in common reference sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/msunname.html |title=The Straight Dope |accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref>  "Sol" is more likely to be encountered in [[science fiction]] writing (''[[Star Trek]]'' in particular) as a formal name for the specific [[star]], since in many stories the use of "sun" as a generic term for the local star would be ambiguous. By extension, the [[Solar System]] is often referred to in science fiction as the "Sol System".

The term ''sol'' is used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a [[solar day]] on another planet, such as [[Mars (planet)|Mars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/images/pia01892.html |title=Opportunity's View, Sol 959 (Vertical) |work=[[NASA]] |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>    A mean Earth solar day is approximately 24 hours, while a mean Martian sol, is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/notes.html |title=Technical Notes on Mars Solar Time as Adopted by the Mars24 Sunclock |publisher=NASA GISS |date=December 13, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>    See also [[Timekeeping on Mars]].

''Sol'' is also the modern word for "Sun" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]. The [[Peru]]vian [[currency]] [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] is named after the Sun (in Spanish), like its successor (and predecessor, in use 1985<U+2013>1991) the [[Peruvian inti|Inti]] (in [[Quechua]]).  In [[Persian language|Persian]], ''sol'' means "[[solar year]]".

In [[East Asia]] the Sun is represented by the symbol <U+65E5> (Chinese [[pinyin]] ''r<U+00EC>'' or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''nichi'') or <U+592A><U+9633>(simplified)/<U+592A><U+967D>(traditional) (pinyin ''t<U+00E0>i y<U+00E1>ng'' or Japanese ''taiy<U+014D>''). In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] these [[Chinese language|Han]] words are called ''nh<U+1EAD>t'' and ''th<U+00E1>i d<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng'' respectively, while the native Vietnamese word ''m<U+1EB7>t tr<U+1EDD>i'' literally means "face of the heavens". The [[Moon]] and the Sun are associated with the [[yin and yang]] where the Moon represents ''yin'' and the Sun ''yang'' as dynamic opposites.
