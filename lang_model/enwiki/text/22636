'''''Laserblast''''' is a 1978 American science fiction film about an unhappy teenage loner who discovers an alien laser cannon and goes on a murderous rampage, seeking revenge against those who he feels have wronged him. The low-budget film was directed by Michael Rae and produced by [[Charles Band]], who is widely known for producing [[B movie]]s. Starring [[Kim Milford]], [[Rainbeaux Smith|Cheryl Smith]] and [[Gianni Russo]], the film features notable cameos appearances by [[Keenan Wynn]] and [[Roddy McDowall]], and marked the screen debut of actor [[Eddie Deezen]].

The script by Frank Ray Perilli and Franne Schacht was heavily influenced by recently released science fiction films like ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). The reptilian alien creatures in the film were works of [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] by animator [[David W. Allen]], marking the first in a decades-long history of collaboration between Allen and Band. The alien spacecraft model featured in ''Laserblast'' was designed and built by [[Greg Jein]] in two weeks, and the musical score was written in five days by [[Joel Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Band]], the first film scores for both composers.

''Laserblast'' has received overwhelmingly negative reviews and consistently ranks among the Bottom 100 list of films on the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Even many critical reviews, however, cited Allen's stop motion animation as one of the film's only redeeming qualities. A 1988 sequel was planned, but ultimately abandoned due to financial difficulties. ''Laserblast'' was featured in the [[Mystery Science Theater 3000 (season 7)|seventh season]] finale of the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', marking the show's final episode on [[Comedy Central]] before the series moved to the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]].

==Plot==
The film opens with a green-skinned man (Franne Schacht) wandering aimlessly through the desert with a mysterious laser cannon attached to his arm. Nearby, an alien spacecraft lands and two reptilian creatures carrying weapons emerge. After a brief firefight, the aliens disintegrate the man, then return to their spacecraft and fly away, leaving behind the laser cannon and a metallic pendant the man was wearing. Elsewhere, teenager Billy Duncan ([[Kim Milford]]) wakes up in his bed, seemingly disturbed. He goes outside to find his mother (Janet Dey) has been invited to a trip to [[Acapulco]] and, despite her son's protests, she leaves her son behind. A disparaged Billy goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy ([[Rainbeaux Smith|Cheryl Smith]]), but her grandfather Colonel Farley ([[Keenan Wynn]]), a disheveled military veteran, spouts wild conspiracy theories and paranoid rants at Billy until he goes away. It becomes clear Billy despises the town he lives in and everybody around him; he is soon harassed both by a teenage bully named Chuck Boran (Mike Bobenko) and his nerdy friend Froggy ([[Eddie Deezen]]), and by two police deputies ([[Dennis Burkley]] and Barry Cutler), who give him a speeding ticket.

Billy wanders into the desert alone and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, making "pow, pow, pow" noises and pretending to shoot things. However, while wearing the pendant and using the cannon simultaneously, the weapon actually fires, and Billy starts firing randomly at things in the desert. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse (in an unsubtitled alien language) with their leader, who orders them to return to [[Earth]] and recover the cannon. Meanwhile, Billy and Kathy attend a pool party with other teens, where Chuck makes an unwanted advance on Kathy, resulting in a fight between Billy, Chuck and Froggy. That night, from a hidden vantage point, Billy fires at Chuck's car with the laser cannon, resulting in a huge explosion that Chuck and Froggy barely escape alive. A government official named Tony Craig ([[Gianni Russo]]) arrives to investigate both the explosion and the desert where Billy found the cannon. Tony informs the local sheriff ([[Ron Masak]]) that the town must be sealed off due to his investigation.

Meanwhile, Billy feels sick due to an unusual growth on his chest. At Kathy's urging, he visits Doctor Mellon ([[Roddy McDowall]]), who surgically removes a metallic disc from Billy's chest. He calls the police laboratory technician Mike London (Rick Walters) to arrange for the disc to be investigated. However, later that night, a green-skinned and seemingly crazed Billy opens fire on Mellon's car, killing him in an explosion. The next day, Tony investigates the wreckage and recovers unusual material, which he brings to Mike London. After some experiments, Mike concludes it is an alien material and cannot be destroyed. Later that night, Billy, once again appearing deranged and grotesque, attacks and kills the two police deputies who harassed him earlier. Elsewhere, Billy and Kathy lay together outside next to Billy's van. While he is sleeping, Kathy discovers his alien pendant and puts it on Billy's chest, which turns his skin green and his eyes and teeth hideously deformed. Billy attacks the horrified Kathy, but she escapes.

Billy goes on a rampage, shooting things at random with the laser cannon. A small airplane with law enforcement officials opens fire on Billy, but he destroys the plane. Next, he comes across Chuck and Froggy in a new car, which he destroys with the cannon, killing both teens. Meanwhile, Tony Craig questions Colonel Farley and Kathy about Billy, while elsewhere the two aliens land on Earth and begin searching for Billy themselves. After killing a hippie (Michael Bryar) and stealing his van, Billy travels to a city block where he fires indiscriminately at his surroundings, screaming like an animal. Kathy and Tony arrive in their car and find Billy in an alley. Before they can speak to him, however, one of the aliens shoots him from atop one of the nearby buildings. Billy is killed and the alien departs in the spacecraft, once again leaving behind the laser cannon and pendant. The film ends with Kathy crying over Billy's corpse as Tony looks on.

==Production==
===Writing===
''Laserblast'' was produced by [[Charles Band]], who is widely known as a writer, producer and director of [[B movie]]s. It was Band who conceived the title of the film with the hopes that it would grab the attention of audiences. Band said of this, "Most of the films that I made, that I conceived, that I was very involved with and in some cases directed, definitely started with the title and usually a piece of artwork that made sense. Then I would work back to the script and the story and make the movie."<ref>{{cite web |last=Simpson |first=M. J. |authorlink=M. J.

Allen]], the film animator who created the [[stop motion]] alien creatures in ''Laserblast''. At the time when Band and Neill met, the former was working full-time on his fantasy film ''[[The Primevals]]'', which was ultimately never completed. Band had developed an interest and familiarity with animation, particularly the works of [[Ray Harryhausen]] like ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963), and wanted Allen to animate the reptilian creatures for his film. Although anxious to work on ''The Primevals'', Allen said he was not yet "sufficiently mature professionally" to undertake a project of that size, and he felt ''Laserblast'' was "something that was more manageable".<ref name="Fischer25" /> Band and Allen would go on to work together on several other films and projects over the next 20 years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ferry|2002|443}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Dalton|2008|p=198}}</ref>

''Laserblast'' has received largely negative reviews, and consistently ranks among the Bottom 100 list of films on the [[Internet Movie Database]].<ref name="Adams26" /> A 1978 critique in ''[[The Review of the News]]'' said, "The only thing eerie about ''Laserblast'' is the thought that the people who made this loser are still running around loose." In the review, ''Laserblast'' was described as "an incomprehensible blending" of popular recent films like ''Star Wars'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', with a script "so disordered we could not be certain that the reels were being run in proper sequence". It also criticized the props, particularly the laser gun, which they compared to a [[cereal box prize]].<ref name="ROTN" /> In a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine review, Donald C. Willis said the special effects were decent, but the script "has more holes than the laser-ravaged landscape."<ref name="DonWillis" /> Janet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' said Kim Milford's performance was dull and that the script included plot-holes and inconsistencies.<ref name="Maslin" /> Film critic [[Michael Medved]] described ''Laserblast'' as one of the worst films of the year in his book, ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Medved|1980|p=108}}</ref>

Literary critic John Kenneth Muir felt the script had many plot-holes left many unanswered questions, and that there was "little effort to forge a coherent story out of the mix".<ref name="Muir561" /> ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' writer David Bianculli described ''Laserblast'' as "numbingly bad".<ref name="Bianculli">{{cite news |last=Bianculli |first=David |title='MST3K Goes Out With a 'Laserblast' |work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] |date=May 17, 1996 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/05/17/1996-05-17__mst3k__goes_out_with_a__las.html |accessdate=December 8, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uoddO1Zr |archivedate=December 8, 2010}}</ref> In ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies'', Phil Hardy describes it as "a wholly unimaginative film", adding, "Even the non-stop series of exploding cars becomes monotonous in the hands of director Rae."<ref name="Hardy" /> The [[Time Out (company)|''Time Out'' Film Guide]] described ''Laserblast'' as a rip-off of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', and said Billy's reign of destruction seemed random and senseless rather than driven by plot or characterization. The review called the film "the epitome of what [[Frank Zappa]] once hymned as 'cheapness.'"<ref>{{Harvnb|Pym|1995|p=398}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film two out of four stars.<ref>{{cite journal |title=MOVIE<U+2014>Science Fiction; 2 hrs. |work=[[TV Guide]] |year=1991 |volume=39 |page=275}}</ref> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' writer Robert Martin called the script inept, said Steve Neill's make-up effects were "frightful rather than frightening", and said Cheryl Smith could "barely talk, let alone act".<ref name="GlobeMail" />

Several critical reviews cited the stop motion animation as one of the film's only redeeming qualities. Richard Meyers, a novelist who also wrote about science-fiction films, described ''Laserblast'' as "basically repetitive and predictable", but included some redemptive qualities in the animation of Dave Allen and the makeup effects of Steve Neill.<ref>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1984|p=90}}</ref> Science fiction literary scholar [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] called it the worst of Charles Band's films, calling it "badly scripted, badly paced rubbish," descriving Allen's animation as "the only plus".<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1984|p=200}}</ref> Likewise, film essayist Dennis Fischer said Allen's stop motion animation provides the film's "sole moments of interest",<ref name="Fischer25" /> and ''[[Cinefex]]'' publisher Don Shay called it the film's "only viable selling points".<ref name="DonShay" /> In their ''DVD & Video Guide'', Mick Martin and Marsha Porter called it a "dreadful low-budget film with some excellent special effects by David Allen".<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|2004|p=616}}</ref> Doug Pratt, who criticized the poor acting and dull dialogue, said the special effects and stop motion animation "are well executed, but the sequences without effects are fairly dumb".<ref name="Pratt" /> The authors of ''The DVD-Laser Disc Newsletter'' called the film "a dull and padded revenge-against-bullies tale", but said the stop motion animation were enjoyable enough that "fans are likely to be pleased with the low-budget film's positive attributes and willing to ignore the rest".<ref name="Laserdisc" />

Not all reviews were negative. Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two-and-a-half stars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|2003|p=777}}</ref> In their book about science fiction films, writers James Robert Parish and Michael R. Pitts called ''Laserblast'' "an stimulating, unpretentious little film in the same vein as ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''". Parish and Pitts praised the stop motion animation and the performance of Cheryl Smith.<ref name="ParishPitts" /> ''Laserblast'' was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed watching it on a [[B movie]] level.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|2010|p=27}}</ref> ''Laserblast'' has achieved something of a [[cult film]] status among some audiences.<ref name="SpaceCom" /><ref name="Webster" />

Brennan claimed it resembled some of the later and better-known works of Joel Goldsmith, like the scores of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''<ref name="SoundtrackNet" />

''Laserblast'' was featured in the seventh season finale episode of ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'', a comedy television series. In the show, the human character [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] and his two robots friends, [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]], are trapped in a satellite and forced by the mad scientist [[Dr. Clayton Forrester (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Dr. Forrester]] to watch bad films as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. In order to get through the experiment, Mike and the robots make jokes mocking the film as they watch. During the episode, their silhouetted images are superimposed over the film to give the impression that they are sitting in a movie theater as they make their jokes. ''Laserblast'' was the sixth episode of the seventh season, which was broadcast on [[Comedy Central]] May 18, 1996. It marked the final episode of ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' on that network,<ref name="Cziraky" /><ref name="Time147">{{cite news |last1=Hadden |first1=Briton |last2=Luce |first2=Henry Robinson |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=147 |year=1996 |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref> before the series moved to the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] for its [[Mystery Science Theater 3000 (season 8)|eighth season]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Baenen |first=Jeff |title='Mystery Science Theater 3000' is Reborn |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=November 16, 1996 |page=27}}</ref>

At the time of the ''Laserblast'' episode's broadcast, the makers of ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' did not know the show would eventually be renewed at a different network, so the end of the series was explained by Dr. Forrester's claim that the funding for his evil experiments had been cut, a reference to Comedy Central's cancellation.<ref name="Bianculli" /> As a result, he was disconnecting life support systems for the [[Satellite of Love (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Satellite of Love]], where Mike and the robots were trapped and forced to watch the films.<ref name="Cziraky" /><ref name="Time147" /> This was to result in the satellite decaying once it entered the orbit of [[Earth]], but the crew was able to regain control of the vessel during breaks from watching the ''Laserblast'' film.<ref name="Cziraky" /> [[Mary Jo Pehl]], an actress and writer with the show, felt ''Laserblast'' was a particularly bad film: "The lead guy, Kim Somebody, is another sterling example of how filmmaking is not a meritocracy. The fact that this film was even made proves that 'anybody can do it.' You can find this either inspiring or depressing."<ref>{{cite web |last=Pehl |first=Mary Jo |authorlink=Mary Jo Pehl |title=Episode 706 - Laserblast |publisher=Satellite News (Official) |year=2001 |url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/guide/ep706.html |accessdate=December 8, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uodDBbtr |archivedate=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

During the riffing of the film, the robot character [[Crow T. Robot]] claims the film "was run through a highly technical process called 'tension extraction'", and the other robot [[Tom Servo]] calls it so dull, "There's a point where it stops being a movie".<ref name="Time147" /> Mike and the robots make particular note of film critic Leonard Maltin's relatively high two and-a-half star rating of the original film. During the end credits, the characters read through ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' and point out celebrated films that achieved an equal ranking, like ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', and ''[[Being There]]'', as well as other acclaimed films with the same rating, like  ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', ''[[The Great Santini]]'', ''[[Unforgiven]]'', or ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]''.<ref name="Cziraky" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

The ''Laserblast'' episode was included in the 2010 [[DVD]] box-set "''Mystery Science Theater 3000'': 20th Anniversary Edition", along with episodes featuring the films ''[[First Spaceship on Venus]]'' (1960), ''[[Werewolf (1996 film)|Werewolf]]'' (1996) and ''[[Future War]]'' (1997).
