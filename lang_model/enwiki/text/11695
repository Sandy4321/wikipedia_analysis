==Lithuanian euro design==
Lithuanian euro coins share a similar national side for all eight coins, and are expected to be issued when Lithuania adopts the Euro. The differences between the coins are that one and two euro coins have vertical lines on the outer circle, the fifty, twenty and ten cent coins have horizontal lines on the outer circle, and the five, two and one cent coins have no lines on the outer circle. The design featuring the [[Vytis]] symbol and the name of the country, "''Lietuva''", was announced on 11 November 2004.  It was created by the sculptor Antanas <U+017D>ukauskas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/about-the-euro-adoption-in-lithuania/euro-banknotes-and-coins/}}</ref>
