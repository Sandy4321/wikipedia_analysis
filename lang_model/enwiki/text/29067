'''''Ed Wood''''' is a 1994 [[comedy-drama]] [[biographical film|biopic]] directed by [[Tim Burton]], and starring [[Johnny Depp]] as [[cult film]]maker [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] The film concerns the period in Wood's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor [[B<U+00E9>la Lugosi]], played by [[Martin Landau]]. [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], [[Lisa Marie]] and [[Bill Murray]] were among the supporting cast.

The film was conceived by writers [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] when they were students at the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for [[family film]]s with their work on ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'' and ''[[Problem Child 2]]'', Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and [[Denise Di Novi]] to produce the ''Ed Wood'' biopic, and [[Michael Lehmann]] as director. Due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Airheads]]'', Lehmann had to vacate the director's position, which was taken over by Burton.

''Ed Wood'' was originally in development at [[Columbia Pictures]], but the studio put the film in [[turnaround]] over Burton's decision to shoot the film in [[black-and-white]]. ''Ed Wood'' was taken to [[Walt Disney Pictures]], who released the film under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner. The film was released to critical acclaim, but was a [[box office bomb]]. Landau and [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]], who designed Landau's [[prosthetic makeup]], won [[Academy Award]]s for their work on the film.

==Plot==
The film opens showing Edward D. Wood, Jr. struggling to join the [[film industry]]. Upon hearing of an announcement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]] is trying to purchase [[Christine Jorgensen]]'s [[film rights#Life rights|life rights]], Ed is inspired to meet Weiss in person. Weiss explains that ''Variety'''s announcement was a [[news leak]], and it is impossible to purchase Jorgensen's rights. The producer decides to "fictionalize" the film (titled ''I Changed My Sex!''), and "do it without the [[shemale]]". Meanwhile, Ed becomes friends with his longtime idol, [[B<U+00E9>la Lugosi]]. With B<U+00E9>la set to "star", Ed convinces Weiss that he is perfect to direct the film because he is a [[transvestite]].

Ed and Weiss argue over the film's title, which Ed changes to ''[[Glen or Glenda]]''. The filming finishes for ''Glen or Glenda'', and Ed is enthusiastic that he starred, directed, wrote and produced his own film. ''Glen or Glenda'' is released to critical and financial failure. Ed is  unsuccessful in getting a job at [[Warner Bros.]]. Ed's girlfriend, [[Dolores Fuller]], tells him that he is not "[[studio system|studio material]]", and that he should find [[independent film|independent backers]] for his upcoming film, ''Bride of the Atom''. Ed is unsuccessful in finding money for ''Bride of the Atom'', but is introduced to the psychic, [[The Amazing Criswell]].

At a bar, Ed meets [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]], whom he thinks has enough money to fund ''Bride of the Atom''. Filming begins, but is halted. Ed convinces [[meat packing industry]] tycoon, Don McCoy, to take over funding the film. McCoy does so, but on the condition that film ends with a giant explosion, and that  his son Tony, who "is a little [[mental retardation|slow]]", is the [[leading man]]. The filming of ''Bride of the Atom'' finishes, but Dolores and Ed [[relationship breakup|breakup]] after the [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrap party]], because of Ed's transvestism. Also, B<U+00E9>la, who is revealed to be highly depressed and a [[morphine]] addict, begins to consider suicide, but Ed talks him out of it. B<U+00E9>la is put in [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], and Ed eventually finds happiness when he meets Kathy O'Hara.

On a date, Kathy tells Ed that she does not mind him being a transvestite. Lugosi is eventually forced to leave rehab due to lack of money. ''Bride of the Atom'' finds a distributor, but the title is changed to ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. The [[premiere]] for ''Bride of the Monster'' goes terribly wrong, and a mob forces Ed and his friends to leave in a [[taxicab]]. Although Lugosi begins to feel much better, he dies days later. Ed is financially struggling, and finds out that his [[landlord]], Mr. Reynolds, along with other members from the [[Baptist]] Church of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], plan on making individual films about the [[Twelve Apostles]]. However, they only have enough money to make one film.

Ed convinces Reynolds that funding Ed's script for ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' would result in a [[box office]] success, and generate enough money to make all of the Twelve Apostles films. Dr. [[Tom Mason]], Kathy's [[chiropractic|chiropractor]], is chosen to be B<U+00E9>la's [[stand-in]]. However, Wood and the Baptists begins having conflicts over the title of the script (which is changed to ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''), Wood's [[B movie]] directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. This causes Ed to leave the set and immediately take a taxi to the nearest [[bar (establishment)|bar]]. There, he has an encounter with his idol [[Orson Welles]]. Welles tells Ed that "visions are worth fighting for", and filming for ''Plan 9'' finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. The film ends with the premiere of ''Plan 9'', and Ed and Kathy taking off to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] to get married.

==Cast==
*'''[[Johnny Depp]]''' as '''[[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]]''': Burton approached Depp and "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed," the actor remembers.<ref name= "Arnold, Gary">{{cite news | author = Gary Arnold | title = Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story | work = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 1994-10-02 | accessdate = 2008-11-29}}</ref> At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, it gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, "rejuvenated my love for acting".<ref name= "Arnold, Gary"/> Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], who had shown him ''Plan 9 From Outer Space'' and ''Glen or Glenda''.<ref name= "Arnold, Gary"/> To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the acting of [[Andy Hardy]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Ronald Regan]] and [[Casey Kasem]].<ref name= "Clark, John">{{cite news | author = John Clark | title = The Wood, The Bad, and The Ugly | work    = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | date = 1994 | accessdate = 2008-11-29}}</ref><ref name=air/> He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood.

*'''[[Martin Landau]]''' as '''[[B<U+00E9>la Lugosi]]''': [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] created the [[prosthetic makeup]] designs.

"Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery...I felt it had to be Lugosi's theatricality, not mine."<ref name= "French, Lawrence"/>
*'''[[Patricia Arquette]]''' as '''Kathy O'Hara''': Ed's girlfriend after his relationship with Dolores. Kathy does not have a problem with Ed's transvestism, and is eventually married to Ed.

*'''[[Jeffrey Jones]]''' as '''[[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]]''': Local [[parapsychology|psychic]] TV entertainer. Criswell helps Ed with usual production duties, finding investors and acting in Ed's films.
*'''[[Max Casella]]''' and '''Brent Hinkley''' portray '''[[Paul Marco]]''' and '''[[Conrad Brooks]]''': Two of Ed's all-around [[production assistant]]s and frequent actors. Paul is hired to find the Lugosi stand-in for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'', while Conrad accidentally has a brief dispute with Lugosi during ''Glen or Glenda''.
*'''[[Bill Murray]]''' as '''[[Bunny Breckinridge]]''': Ed's openly-[[homosexuality|gay]] friend. Bunny is assigned to find transvestites to appear in ''Glen or Glenda'', as well as portraying the "The Ruler" in ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.

==Production==
Writers [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] conceived the idea for a [[biographical film|biopic]] of [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] when they were students at the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]].<ref name=hard/> Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood entitled, ''The Man in the Angora Sweater'' in his sophomore year at [[University of Southern California|USC]].<ref name= "Gore, Chris">{{cite news | author = Chris Gore; Jeremy Berg | title = Ed or Johnny: The Strange Case of Ed Wood | work = [[Film Threat]] | pages = 36 | date = December 1994 | accessdate = 2008-11-28}}</ref> However, Karaszewski figured, "there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made".<ref name= "Gore, Chris"/> Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for [[family film]]s for their work on ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'' and ''[[Problem Child 2]]'', Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page [[film treatment]] for ''Ed Wood'' and [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]ed the idea to ''[[Heathers]]'' director [[Michael Lehmann]], with whom they were at USC film school.<ref name=hard/> The basis for their treatment came from [[Rudolph Grey]]'s ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'',<ref>{{cite book | author= Rudolph Grey | title = Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr | publisher =Feral House | date =1994 | pages = | id = ISBN 0-922915-24-5}}</ref> a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues.<ref name= "Dwyer">{{cite news | author = Michael Dwyer | title = The Stuff Dreams are Made Of | work = [[The Irish Times]] | date = 1994-12-10 | accessdate = 2008-11-29}}</ref> Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on ''Heathers'', [[Denise Di Novi]]. Di Novi had previously worked with [[Tim Burton]] on ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing.<ref name=hard/>

Burton began reading ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'' and some of Woods' letters. He was taken by how he "wrote about his films as if he was making ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', you know, whereas other people perceived them as, like, the worst movies ever".<ref name= "Dwyer"/> Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias borne of his admiration rather than derision of Wood's work.<ref name= "Thompson2">{{cite news | author = Bob Thompson | title = Beyond the Fringe | work = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = 1994-10-04 | accessdate = 2008-11-29}}</ref> The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, [[Vincent Price]]. He said in an interview, "Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on me, the same impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol."<ref>{{cite book | author= Edwin Page | title = Gothic Fantasy: The Films of Tim Burton | publisher =[[Marion Boyars Publishers]] | date =2007 | pages =128-142 | id = ISBN 0-7145-3132-4 | chapter = Ed Wood | location = London}}</ref> Meanwhile, Burton had been to direct ''[[Mary Reilly (film)|Mary Reilly]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]] with [[Winona Ryder]] in the title role.<ref name=hard/> 

However, Burton dropped out of ''Mary Reilly'' over Columbia's decision to [[fast track]] the film and their interest with [[Julia Roberts]] in the title role instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to becoming interested in directing ''Ed Wood'' himself, on the understanding it could be done quickly.<ref name=hard/> Lehmann said, "Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to ''[[Airheads]]''."<ref name=air>{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | date =1999 | pages =155-165 | id = ISBN 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Ed Wood in Hollywood}}</ref> Lehmann was given [[executive producer]] credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites.<ref name=hard>Salisbury, Burton, pp. 128-130</ref> ''Ed Wood'' gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, "On a picture like this I find you don't need to [[storyboard]]. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous."<ref name= "French2">{{cite news | author = Lawrence French | title = Tim Burton's ''Ed Wood'' | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages = 32-34 | date = October 1994 | accessdate = 2008-11-29}}</ref>

Initially, ''Ed Wood'' was in development with Columbia Pictures, but when Burton decided he wanted to shoot the film in [[black-and-white]], studio head [[Mark Canton]] would not agree to it unless Columbia was given a [[first look deal]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Leonard Klady; John Evan Prook | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR106148 | title = Burton pic in turnaround as Col chairman balks | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-04-22 | accessdate = 2008-11-28}}</ref> Burton said black-and-white was "right for the material and the movie, and this was a movie that ''had'' to be in black-and-white". He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original [[start date]], Canton put ''Ed Wood'' into [[turnaround]]. The decision sparked interest from [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] in [[option (finance)|option]]ing the [[film rights]], but Burton accepted an offer from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]], who had previously produced ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''. Similar to ''Nightmare'', Disney distributed ''Ed Wood'' under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was that much of a risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy. Burton also refused a salary, and was not paid for his work on ''Ed Wood''. [[Principal photography]] began in August 1993,<ref>Salisbury, Burton, pp.131-136</ref> and lasted 72 days.<ref name= "Clark, John"/> Despite his previous six-film relationship with [[Danny Elfman]], Burton chose [[Howard Shore]] to write the [[film score]]. Burton admitted he and Elfman experienced "creative differences" during ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''.<ref name=Danny/>

==Historical inaccuracies==
When describing historical inaccuracies, Burton explained, "it's not like a completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it."<ref name=hard/> Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating he did not want to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes.<ref name= "Thompson2"/> He said in an interview, "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy&ndash;saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling."<ref name= "Smith, Gavin">{{cite news | author = Gavin Smith | title = Tim Burton: Punching Holes in Reality | work = [[Film Comment]] | pages = 52-63 | date = November/December 1994 | accessdate = 2008-11-29}}</ref>

B<U+00E9>la Lugosi was not prone to fits of swearing, particularly in front of women. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, B<U+00E9>la Jr., were omitted.<ref name=forward>Hanke, Chapter 17: "Visions Worth Fighting For", p. 167<U+2014>182</ref> Burton biographer Ken Hanke criticized the depiction of [[Dolores Fuller]]. "The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman," Hanke said, "while Parker's performance  presents her as a kind of sitcom moron for the first part of the film and a rather judgmental at wholly pleasant character in her later scenes."<ref name=forward/> During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on ''[[Queen for a Day]]'' and ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'', which is not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave ''Ed Wood'' a positive review. "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. I wished they could have made it a deeper love story, because we really loved each other. We strived to find investors together, I worked so hard to support Ed and I."<ref name=forward/>

===Box office===
''Ed Wood'' had its [[limited release]] on September 30, 1994. When the film went into [[wide release]] on October 7, 1994 in 623 theaters, ''Ed Wood'' grossed $1.9 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $5.8 million in North America, well below its estimated $18 million production budget.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ed Wood | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=edwood.htm | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-11-23}}</ref> ''Ed Wood'' was declared a [[box office bomb]].

===Reviews===
Despite the poor box office performance, ''Ed Wood'' went on to receive critical acclaim. Based on 55 reviews collected by ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', 91% of the critics enjoyed ''Ed Wood'', with an average score of 7.9/10.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ed_wood | title = Ed Wood | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-11-27}}</ref> By comparison, ''[[Metacritic]]'' collected an average score of 70/100, based on 19 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/edwood | title = Ed Wood (1994): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-11-27}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave a largely positive review: "Burton has made is a film which celebrates Wood more than it mocks him, and which celebrates, too, the zany spirit of 1950s [[exploitation film]]s, in which a great title, a has-been star and a lurid ad campaign were enough to get bookings for some of the oddest films ever made."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | title = Ed Wood | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url =

"Ed Wood is Burton's most personal and provocative movie to date," he wrote. "Outrageously disjointed and just as outrageously entertaining, the picture stands as a successful outsider's tribute to a failed kindred spirit."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | title = Ed Wood | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947169/review/5947170/ed_wood | date = 2000-12-08 | accessdate = 2008-11-28}}</ref>

[[Janet Maslin]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', thought [[Johnny Depp]] "proved" himself as an established "certified great actor".

"The script by [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] posits Wood as a classic American optimist, a [[Frank Capra|Capra]]esque hero with little to be optimistic about, since he was also a classic American loser. That's a fine start, but the film then marches in clique chronological order." Corliss continued, "One wonders why this Burton film is so dishwatery, why it lacks the cartoon zest and outsider ache of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' or ''[[Batman Returns]]''."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | title = A Monster to Be Despised | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url =
