'''''The Dark Knight Rises''''' is a 2012 [[superhero film]] directed by [[Christopher Nolan]], who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother [[Jonathan Nolan]] and the story with [[David S. Goyer]]. Based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], the film is the third installment in [[Batman_in_film#The_Dark_Knight_Trilogy|Nolan's ''Batman'' film series]], and is a sequel to ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008). ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is intended to be the conclusion of the series. [[Christian Bale]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] reprise their roles from ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight''. The film takes place eight years after the events of ''The Dark Knight'' and introduces the characters of [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]<U+2014>portrayed by [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Tom Hardy]], respectively.<ref name="Empire1"/>

Nolan was initially hesitant about returning to the series for a second time, but agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Filming took place in various locations, including locations in [[Jodhpur]], [[London]], [[Nottingham]], [[Glasgow]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Nolan utilized [[IMAX]] cameras for much of the filming to optimize the quality of the picture. As with ''The Dark Knight'', [[viral marketing]] campaigns began early during production to help promote the upcoming film. When filming concluded, [[Warner Bros.]] refocused its campaign; developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film and theatrical trailers, and sending random pieces of information regarding the film's plot to various companies.

''The Dark Knight Rises'' premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012.<ref name="world premiere"/> The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, 2012,<ref name="ozrelease"/> and in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012.<ref name="Itzkoff"/><ref name="releasedate"/> Release date varies in other countries and territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jabcatmovies.com/2012/03/the-dark-knight-rises-worldwide-theatrical-release-dates/|title=The Dark Knight Rises<U+2014>Worldwide Theatrical Release Dates|publisher=Jabcat On Movies|date=18 March 2012|accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->
Eight years after the events of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)#Plot|The Dark Knight]]'', [[Gotham City]] is in a state of peace. Under powers granted by the Dent Act, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] has nearly eradicated violent and organized crime. However, he still feels guilty about the cover-up of [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]'s crimes. At a function celebrating Dent, he plans to admit to the conspiracy, but decides that the city is not ready to hear the truth. While following a lead in the abduction of a congressman from the function, Gordon's speech falls into the hands of terrorist leader [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. Gordon is shot in the process, and he promotes patrol officer John Blake to detective, allowing Blake to report directly to him.

As Batman has disappeared from Gotham City, so too has Bruce Wayne, locking himself inside [[Wayne Manor]]. [[Wayne Enterprises]] is crumbling after he invested in a clean energy project designed to harness fusion power, but shut the project down after learning that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. Both Gordon and Blake<U+2014>who has deduced Batman's identity<U+2014>implore Bruce to return as Batman, but [[Alfred Pennyworth]] resigns in a failed attempt to dissuade him as Wayne's health has worsened and out of hopes he would pursue a normal life. 

Bane stages an attack on the stock exchange and uses a stolen set of Bruce's fingerprints to place a number of risky investments in his name, bankrupting Bruce and forcing him to relinquish control of Wayne Enterprises. Correctly suspecting that his business rival, [[Roland Daggett|John Daggett]], has employed Bane to aid in an aggressive take-over of the company, Bruce entrusts businesswoman Miranda Tate to keep full control out of Daggett's hands. 

Following a trail left by cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]], Batman confronts Bane, who says that he assumed the leadership of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]] following the death of [[Ra's al Ghul]]. Bane kills Daggett and reveals that he was using Daggett's construction firms to stage a heist on Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division. He steals Bruce's arsenal before crippling Batman and detaining him in a prison from which escape is virtually impossible. The other inmates relate the story of the only person to ever successfully escape from the prison, a child driven by necessity and the sheer force of will, said to be the child of [[Ra's al Ghul]].

Bane lures the vast majority of Gotham's police force underground and sets off a chain of explosions across the city, trapping the officers and turning Gotham City into an isolated city-state. Any attempt to leave the city will result in the detonation of the Wayne Enterprises fusion core, which has been converted into a bomb. Addressing the citizens, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's death, and releases the prisoners locked up under the Dent Act. The rich and powerful are dragged from their homes and put before a show trial presided over by [[Scarecrow (comics)|Jonathan Crane]]. After an attempt to sneak Special Forces soldiers into the city fails, the government blockades Gotham and the city further regresses into a state of [[anarchy]].

Meanwhile, Bruce retrains himself to be Batman and successfully escapes Bane's prison to return to Gotham. He enlists Selina, Blake, Miranda, Gordon and [[Lucius Fox]] to help liberate the city and stop the fusion bomb before it grows too unstable and explodes. Batman confronts and subdues Bane, but is betrayed by Miranda as she reveals herself to be [[Talia al Ghul]]. It was she who escaped the prison as a child, and plans to complete her father's work (by destroying Gotham) and exact personal vengeance against Bruce for his death. Gordon successfully cuts off the bomb's ability to be remotely detonated while Selina kills Bane, allowing Batman to chase Talia. He tries to force her to take the bomb to the fusion chamber where it can be stabilized, but she remotely floods the chamber. Batman shoots her truck off the road and Talia dies in the resulting crash, confident that the bomb cannot be stopped. Using [[Batplane|The Bat]] developed by Fox, Batman hauls the bomb beyond the city limits, where it detonates over the ocean.

In the aftermath of the explosion, Batman is praised as a sacrificial hero and Bruce is believed dead as a casualty of the riot. As Bruce's estate is divided up, Alfred witnesses Bruce and Selina together alive in a cafe in Italy, while John "Robin" Blake inherits the Batcave.

* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name="CastWayne1"/>
:A billionaire socialite dedicated to protecting [[Gotham City]] from the criminal underworld. Nolan has stated that, due to the eight-year gap between the events of ''The Dark Knight'' and those of ''The Dark Knight Rises'', "he's an older Bruce Wayne; he's not in a great state."<ref name=EightYears /> Bale employed a mixed martial arts discipline called the [[Keysi Fighting Method]], but due to Bruce's current state and Bane's style, the method had to be modified.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Bale has stated that ''The Dark Knight Rises'' will be the final film in which he plays Batman,<ref name="Inquirer" /> and describes the character's arc as finally confronting the pain of loss that he has deferred for years by fighting criminals balanced against the need to internalise that pain lest he give into his emotions and become the killer the city already believes him to be.<ref name="NYDailyNewsWayne"/>
* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]:<ref name="Jensen"/>
:A terrorist leader intent on destroying Gotham City. He was originally a member of the League of Shadows, before being excommunicated. The character was chosen by Christopher Nolan because of his desire to see Batman tested on both a physical and mental level.<ref name=EightYears /> Bane has been described as "a terrorist in both thought and action"<ref name=EightYears /> and is "florid in his speech, [with] the physicality of a gorilla".<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Hardy stated that he intended to portray the character as "more menacing" than [[Robert Swenson]]'s version of the character in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' and that in order to do so, his portrayal entailed creating a contradiction between the voice and the body. Hardy gained {{convert|30|lb|kg}} for the role,<ref name="Filipponi"/> increasing his weight to {{convert|198|lb|kg}}.<ref name="Filipponi"/> Hardy based the character's voice on that of [[Bartley Gorman]].<ref name="HardyVoice"/>
* [[Anne Hathaway]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name="Jensen"/><ref name="CastHathaway1"/>
:Selina Kyle is a cat burglar described as "an associate" of Bane<ref name="Boucher2" /> who establishes a relationship with Batman that "takes some of the somberness away from his character."<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Kyle is pursuing a "clean slate", a computer program rumoured to be able to erase a person's criminal history when she crosses paths with Bruce Wayne. Hathaway auditioned not knowing what role she was being considered for, admitting that she had one character in mind, but only learned that the role was Selina Kyle after talking with Christopher Nolan for an hour.<ref name="CastHathaway3"/> Hathaway described the role as being the most physically-demanding she had ever played, and confessed that while she thought of herself as being fit she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the demands of the role.<ref name="Selena"/><ref name="Selena2"/> Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to [[Hedy Lamarr]]<U+2014>who was the inspiration for the [[Catwoman]] character<U+2014>in developing her performance.<ref name="Boucher2" /> Selina is never reffered to, despite wearing the costume, as Catwoman.
* [[Michael Caine]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]:<ref name="Boucher"/>
:Bruce's trusted butler and confidant. Alfred has acted as a father figure to Bruce, and continues to aid Bruce on his missions as well as supplying him with useful advice. Alfred is unable to accept Bruce's desire to revive his Batman persona, even going so far as to resign from his position to impress the seriousness of Bruce's position upon him. Christopher Nolan emphasised the emotional bond between Alfred and Bruce, stressing its importance in the previous films and predicting that the relationship will be strained as it never has before.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/>
* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]:<ref name="Boucher"/>
:Commissioner of the [[Gotham City Police Department]], and one of the city's few honest police officers. Gary Oldman described the character's work in cleaning up Gotham City as having left him world-weary and slightly bored,<ref name="GordonCharacter"/> likening Gordon to a soldier who leaps at the chance to be on the front lines.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Gordon feels guilty over his role in covering up the death of Harvey Dent to the point where he is prepared to resign from his position as Commissioner over it, but refrains from doing so when he senses that Gotham is about to come under threat.
* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Lucius Fox]]:<ref name="Boucher"/>
:Fox runs [[Wayne Enterprises]] on behalf of Bruce Wayne and serves as his [[armourer|armorer]], providing him with high-tech equipment. His position as President of Wayne Enterprises allows him to discreetly develop cutting-edge technology and weaponry, even as Wayne Enterprises starts losing money.
* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Miranda Tate:
:A member of the Wayne Enterprises executive board who encourages a still-grieving Bruce Wayne to rejoin with society and continue his father's philanthropic works.<ref name="Gordon-LevittandCotillard"/> Cotillard denied speculation that she would be playing a dual role as Miranda Tate and Talia al Ghul, stating that her character is a completely original creation,<ref name="CastCotillard1"/> though the final cut of the film revealed this to be misdirection. Tate was described as providing Bruce with a much-needed sense of hope at the behest of Alfred and Lucius Fox.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> 
* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as John Blake:
:John Blake is a young police officer whose instincts lead him to believe that there is trouble on the horizon. Seeing something of himself in Blake, Commissioner Gordon promotes him to special duty.<ref name="Gordon-LevittandCotillard" /> Blake represents the idealism that Gordon and Bruce Wayne once held, but soon lost in their battle against crime in the city.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> He is portrayed as being intelligent enough to deduce Batman's identity, and is disgusted by the cover-up of the circumstances surrounding Harvey Dent's death and Commissioner Gordon's role in it.

Warner Bros. president of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film would be released in 2011 or 2012.<ref name="Development1"/> Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. "On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question," he reasoned, "how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?"<ref name="Development2"/> Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary.<ref name="Development8"/> By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to ''[[Inception]]''.<ref name="Development3"/> Later in December, [[Alan F. Horn]] confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors.<ref name="Development4"/> Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.<ref name="Development5"/> Following the success of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] in ''The Dark Knight'', studio executives wished for [[The Riddler]] to be included as the primary villain as he was considered a similar character and encouraged the casting of [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].<ref name=beginsending>{{cite journal|title=It Begins With An Ending|author=Jolin, Dan|date=May 31, 2012|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}</ref> However, Nolan wanted the antagonist to be vastly different than the previous incarnations and committed to using [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] instead,<ref name=beginsending/> citing the need for a character with a physical presence within the film.<ref name="Banechoice"/> He was initially unfamiliar with the character's [[back-story]],<ref name="Banechoice2"/> but pointed out the appeal of an archetype, labelling it as "the extreme of some type of villainy". When comparing the choice of Bane with the Joker, Nolan highlighted the Joker as an example of "diabolical, chaotic anarchy and has a devilish sense of humor", juxtaposing him against Bane, who he likened to "a classic movie monster [...] with a terrific brain."<ref name="Banechoice"/>

It was not until February 9, 2010, that it was announced that Nolan had "cracked" the story of a sequel to ''The Dark Knight'' and was committed to return to the project.<ref name="Development6"/> Shortly afterward, it was announced [[David S. Goyer]] and Jonathan Nolan were working on a screenplay.<ref name="scriptunderway"/> Goyer would leave the project during pre-production to begin work on ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''; Jonathan continued writing the script based on the story by his brother Chris and Goyer.<ref name="Boucher"/> The film's storyline has been compared with the story arcs in the ''Batman'' comic book series ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' (1993), which debuted the villain [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]; ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986), in which Batman returns to [[Gotham City]] after a ten-year absence; and ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' (1999), which depicts Gotham being overrun by gangs.<ref name="ComicST"/><ref>[http://io9.com/5916489/clues-from-the-comics-about-batmans-fate-in-the-dark-knight-rises Clues from the Comics About Batman's Fate in The Dark Knight Rises<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Nolan confirmed the Joker would not return in the third film, and dismissed rumors that he considered using unused footage of [[Heath Ledger]] from ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name="Development9"/> ''The Dark Knight Rises'' will reunite Nolan with many of his past collaborators, including cinematographer [[Wally Pfister]], production designer Nathan Crowley, editor [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]], costume designer Lindy Hemming, special effects supervisors Paul Franklin and [[Chris Corbould]], and composer [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref name="Development10"/>

===Filming===
[[File:Batmobile on set.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|left|The [[Batmobile|Tumbler]] on the set of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' in [[Pittsburgh]]]]
During location scouting in December 2010, Nolan began searching for locations such as India, Romania, and Michigan.<ref name="Location1"/><ref name="Location2"/><ref name="Location3"/> According to the ''Romania Insider'', Nolan was interested in the Bucharest's historical center, Edgar Quinet Street, [[Palace of the Parliament]], and the Turda salt mines.<ref name="Location1"/> The film had an estimated budget of $250&nbsp;million.<ref name="Filming1"/> Nolan elected not to film in [[3-D film|3-D]], but instead stated that he intended to focus on improving image quality and scale using the [[IMAX]] format.<ref name="Filming2"/> ''The Dark Knight Rises'' featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, ''The Dark Knight'' contained 28 minutes).<ref name="60Minutes" /><ref name="ColliderIMAX"/> Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues.<ref name="ColliderIMAX"/> Wally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX,<ref name="Filming4"/> but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, [[35 mm film|35mm]] and [[70 mm film|70mm]] cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes,<ref name="ColliderIMAX"/><ref name="40Minutes" /> as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras.<ref name="ColliderIMAX2" /> Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX plans to run the film in its theatres for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks.<ref name="2months"/>

Filming was scheduled to start in May and conclude in November 2011.<ref name="Semlyen"/> [[Principal photography]] commenced on May 6, 2011, in [[Jodhpur]], India at the [[Mehrangarh Fort]]<ref name="Filming5"/><ref name="Filming6"/> before moving to [[Pittsburgh]], where it operated under the working title "Magnus Rex" to reduce the visibility of the production.<ref name="Filming7"/><ref name="CMU"/> Shooting locations within the city included [[Heinz Field]], the site of an [[American football]] game,<ref name="Filming8"/> with members of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] playing the Gotham Rogues football team. More than 11,000 extras were used to depict the shot sequence.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/><ref name="Steelers-1" /><ref name="Steelers-2" /> Filming in Pittsburgh also took place at the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research|Mellon Institute]] and [[Software Engineering Institute]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].<ref name="CMU" /> A letter sent out to residents and business owners detailing road closures revealed that the streets of the city would be featured "as the start of [the] film".<ref name="Filming10"/> [[9-1-1]] operators were told to expect an increase in calls related to gun shots and explosions in the film's production.<ref name="Schutte"/> The Pittsburgh leg of production wrapped after three weeks on August 21, 2011, before moving on to Los Angeles and New York.<ref name="Filming13"/> The [[Trump Tower (New York City)|Trump Tower]] replaced the [[Richard J. Daley Center]] as the location for the headquarters of [[Wayne Enterprises]].<ref name="TrumpTower"/> In November 2011, shooting shifted to [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name="Filming11"/><ref name="Filming12"/> [[Newark City Hall]] and [[Military Park (Newark)|Military Park]] were among the locations used for filming.<ref name="Filming15"/> Other shooting locations include [[London]] and [[Glasgow]], the latter of which was used for "additional exterior filming".<ref name="Filming16"/> Principal photography concluded on November 14, 2011.<ref name="Filming17"/>

Production photos from filming in Pittsburgh showed a second [[Batmobile#Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises|Tumbler]] chassis after the first was destroyed, indicating that a new Batmobile would be in the film, following the destruction of the first in ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name="Filming18"/> Further set photos revealed a "new vehicle" being transported to [[Wabash Tunnel]], prompting speculation as to its nature.<ref name="Filming19"/> In June 2011, Autoblog confirmed the presence of the new [[Lamborghini Aventador]] on the film set.<ref name="Filming20"/>

Several accidents occurred during the production of the film. While filming at [[Wollaton Hall]], a [[Semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]] crashed into the main entrance, though no one was injured.<ref name="Filming21"/> A stuntman [[Parachuting|parachutist]] later crashed through the roof of a home in Cairngorm Gliding Club, Feshiebridge in Scotland, and became wedged there after a failed landing during a skydiving stunt; he was not seriously injured.<ref name="Filming22"/> While filming scenes in Pittsburgh, Hathaway's stunt double crashed into an IMAX camera while filming a sequence that required her to ride a [[Batcycle#The Dark Knight Rises|Batpod]] down a flight of stairs during a riot. There were no injuries, but the camera was destroyed.<ref name="BatpodCrash" /> A second accident took place in Pittsburgh when the truck carrying the then-unidentified vehicle later termed "The Bat" went off-course and crashed into a lighting array, damaging the model of the aircraft. Production was delayed while the model was repaired.<ref name="Filming25"/>

===Design===
====Costume design====
[[File:Bane Tom Hardy5.jpg|thumb|upright|A digitally-mapped model of Tom Hardy's face and skull was used to design and construct Bane's mask.]]
[[Costume designer]] Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, "keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function."<ref name="Design2"/><ref name="Design5"/> Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary, "like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places".<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with [[shearling]].<ref name="Design4"/>

The [[Batsuit]] consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a [[polyester]] mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiberpanels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/>

In creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being [[polyurethane]] coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/>

====Production design====
[[Concept artist]] Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of [[cinematography]] when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ''[[Men in Black 3]]'': "The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is a war film."<ref name="Filming26"/> Producer [[Emma Thomas]] stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film."<ref name="Thomas"/>

The film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the [[Batplane]], dubbed "the Bat". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to "fit into the same family" as the Tumbler and the Bat-pod. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] and the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]].<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over [[computer-generated imagery]]. In order to make the Bat "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/><ref name="Design3"/><ref name="Design6"/>

When designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave with water and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/> Another set was designed at Cardington as an "underground prison", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a {{convert|120|foot|m}} vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the "forbidding landscape added to the desolation".<ref name="ProductionNotes"/>

In an interview in October 2010, composer [[Hans Zimmer]] confirmed that he will be returning to score ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' [[James Newton Howard]] was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'', but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of ''Inception'' would make him seem like a "third wheel".<ref name="Howard" /> In November 2011, Zimmer [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online audio recordings of a chant to be used in the film's score.<ref name="Music1"/><ref name="TDKRChant"/> When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, "The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we Twittered and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind."<ref name="Music2"/> For ''The Dark Knight Rises'', Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a "completely different direction" for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.<ref name="ProductionNotes"/>

==Marketing==
In May 2011, the film's official website was launched, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote ''The Dark Knight''. When the website was opened, an encrypted audio file played the noise of what has been described as chanting. When the audio file was decrypted, it gave a hashtag "#TheFireRises". For every person who commented on [[Twitter]] with the hashtag, a pixel was removed from the webpage, eventually revealing the first official image of Bane.<ref name="Marketing1"/>

[[File:DarkKnightRisesViral.jpg|thumb|left|horizontal|''TheDarkKnightRises.com'' was replaced with a dossier of an "anonymous vigilante", presenting information on the suspect<U+2014>as well as several accusations, and depicting a warning claiming that the "suspect should be considered armed and dangerous".]]
In July 2011, a [[Teaser campaign|teaser]] trailer that was meant to be released with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows <U+2013> Part 2]]'' was leaked online.<ref name=Davis/> It was released by the studio three days later. Responses to the trailer were mixed; Stephen Spencer Davis of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote that it successfully built hype,<ref name=Davis /> while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant was disappointed with the trailer, claiming that it was more of an "announcement trailer" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality of the trailer, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had "hammy" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the final sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the trailer for ''Inception''.<ref name=Outlaw/> A theatrical teaser trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to theatrical prints of ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''.<ref name="TDKRtrailer1"/> Like the teaser trailer, the theatrical trailer was also leaked online<ref name="Marketing3"/> before being released the following week.<ref name="Marketing4"/> Critics noted political undertones to the trailer, with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] and an "[[Occupy movement|Occupy Gotham]]" campaign within the world of the story.<ref name="Marketing5"/><ref name="Marketing6"/><ref name="Marketing8"/> Receiving more than 12.5&nbsp;million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from [[iTunes]], beating the previous record held by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name="Marketing9"/> However, the second trailer for ''The Avengers'' again set the record with 13.7&nbsp;million downloads.<ref name="NYDailyNews" /> A second theatrical trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''. An "unnamed" Warner Brothers executive clarified that "We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see<U+2014>and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!" The executive also commented that the trailer will "provide the best potential exposure for TDKR."<ref name="TDKRtrailer2"/> The trailer was released online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before the attachment of the trailers on the theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''.<ref name="TDKRtrailer3"/>

Continuing a method used with ''The Dark Knight'' whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' seven months before release,<ref name=TDKopening/> a six-minute prologue of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of ''[[Mission: Impossible <U+2013> Ghost Protocol]]'', again approximately seven months before release.<ref name="6Minutes"/> Critical reaction to the prologue was positive,<ref name="MarketingProlog1"/><ref name="MarketingProlog2"/><ref name="MarketingProlog3"/> with one critic commenting that "no one gets to make a film on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan," though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear.<ref name="MarketingProlog4"/> Addressing the issue in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nolan said "I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him."<ref name="BaneVoice" />

Viral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' received "CIA documents" concerning a "Dr. Leonid Pavel", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by [[Abkhazia|Georgian separatists]], but with most of the conversation redacted.<ref name="Marketing2"/> These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.<ref name="MarketingProlog1"/> The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing "Operation Early Bird". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.<ref name="Earlybird"/><ref name="Earlybird2"/> Various websites received a package that included a cylinder map of "strike zones", and a "fire rises" [[T-shirt]].<ref name="Marketing12"/> In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a "dossier" of an on a suspect named "John Doe" also known as "The Batman" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City "redoubles" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming "Harvey Dent Day". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where "graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.<ref name="Marketing21"/>

In January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets have surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.<ref name="Marketing10" />

At the [[American International Toy Fair]], [[Mattel]] unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, "The Bat". The Mattel figures will also be released in the "Movie Masters" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. [[Lego]] is set to release building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, [[Funko]] is releasing a series of [[plush]] toys, [[Mezco Toyz]] are releasing vinyl figures, and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] are releasing the Batman Tumbler car.<ref name="Marketing11" /> Other partners include [[Jakks Pacific]] who are creating novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys,<ref name="Marketing13"/> and PPW Toys, who are creating a Batman themed [[Mr. Potato Head]].<ref name="Marketing14"/> Various clothing items including shoes, t-shirts, hats and wallets are also being produced.<ref name="Marketing15"/>

The film [[novelization]], written by award-winning author [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]] and published by [[Titan Books]], will be released alongside the film on July 24, 2012.<ref name="Marketing20"/>

Warner Bros. partnered with [[Mountain Dew]] to do a cross-promotion that included a special paint scheme on the #88 [[Chevrolet Impala#NASCAR|Chevrolet Impala]] owned by [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and driven by [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]].<ref name="Marketing22"/> On June 17, 2012, the car won the [[2012 Quicken Loans 400]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]].<ref name="Marketing23"/> On July 4, 2012, the studio signed a deal with [[Formula One]] team [[Lotus F1]] to have the film's logos appear on the [[Lotus E20]]s driven by [[Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen]] and [[Romain Grosjean]] at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].<ref name="Lotus"/> R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen and Grosjean went on to finish the race in fifth and sixth place respectively.<ref name="Silverstone"/> Warner Bros. had previously followed a similar promotion at the [[2008 British Grand Prix]], when the now-defunct [[Toyota F1]] carried a livery to promote ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name="Toyota"/>

On July 6, 2012, [[Warner Bros.]] held a special [[IMAX]] screening of the film for more than one hundred reporters and critics.

<!-- WHEN UPDATING REVIEW AGGREGATE SCORES, PLEASE BE SURE TO UPDATE EVERYTHING IN THE CITATION FIELDS, INCLUDING THE ACCESS DATES. -->
''The Dark Knight Rises'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics. It received an 87% "Certified fresh" approval rating from critics on aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 224 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10.

===Commentary===
[[David Sirota]] writing in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' compared ''The Dark Knight Rises'' and the game ''[[Call of Duty]]'' to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: "Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected the spirit of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Revolution<U+2019>s conservative backlash, we are now seeing two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]<U+2019>s rhetorical backlash to the powerful [[Occupy Wall Street]] zeitgeist."<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2012/07/18/batman_hates_the_99_percent/ Batman hates the 99 Percent]. ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. July 19, 2012.</ref> Catherine Shoard of ''[[The Guardian]]'' went further by claiming the film "is a quite audaciously capitalist vision, radically conservative, radically vigilante, that advances a serious, stirring proposal that the wish-fulfilment of the wealthy is to be championed if they say they want to do good."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/jul/17/dark-knight-rises-capitalist-superhero Dark Knight Rises: fancy a capitalist caped crusader as your superhero?]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. July 17, 2012.</ref>

Nolan has however denied the film criticizes the Occupy movement and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: "I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, <U+201C>Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?<U+201D> <U+2013> well, obviously, that's not true."<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/christopher-nolan-dark-knight-rises-isn-t-political-20120720 Christopher Nolan: 'Dark Knight Rises' Isn<U+2019>t Political].
