The '''Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge''' was a restaurant and club located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Nob Hill]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. Popular with a younger crowd, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s-era furnishings, and for hosting [[karaoke]] and goldfish racing tournaments. Gypsy is said to have influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints and signs of drunken behavior by patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure. Concept Entertainment owned the restaurant from 1992 until 2014, when it was sold unexpectedly.

==History==
In 1948, ''The Oregonian'' published an advertisement for the Gypsy Restaurant and Lounge, promoting an 8-course dinner for $1.25, between the hours of 4pm and 3am. The restaurant's location was described as "next to 21st Avenue Theater", between Northwest Hoyt and Irving Streets.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Good News!|page=25|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=January 16, 1948|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref> In 1955, the paper reported that $1,000 was stolen from an unlocked safe stored at the Gypsy Restaurant, located at 612 Northwest 21st Avenue.<ref>{{cite news|title=Restaurant Safe Yields Loot|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=January 14, 1955|location=Portland, Oregon|page=51}}</ref>

In 1963, the restaurant and lounge relocated to the intersection of Northwest 21st Avenue and Hoyt Street, across from Cinema 21 Theater.<ref name=Feb1963>{{cite news|last=March|first=Fredric|title=Behind the Mike|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=February 20, 1963|location=Portland, Oregon|page=23}}</ref><ref name=Murphy>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Francis|title=Behind the Mike|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 17, 1963|location=Portland, Oregon|page=29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Francis|title=Behind the Mike|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 25, 1963|location=Portland, Oregon|page=19}}</ref> Artwork on the interior walls included a large and colorful painting depicting a gypsy camp, and an "attractive" nude called ''Dian'' by Grace Harlow, a painter and former student of Louis Bunce.<ref name=Murphy/> The "New Gypsy", which also featured "mottled" iridescent red windows that were translucent,<ref name=Feb1963/> could seat 150 guests and included a banquet area. On opening night, the restaurant reportedly played songs by [[Frank Fontaine]].<ref name=Murphy/>

According to an obituary published in 1973, Gypsy Restaurant was then owned and operated by Stacy Gurganus.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Stacy Gurganus|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=December 27, 1973|location=Portland, Oregon|page=18}}</ref> Another obituary published by ''The Oregonian'' in 1987 said that Gertrude "Tiny" Hurisick of [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]] co-owned Gypsy and Gordon's 7-Up Bar, also located in Northwest Portland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Gertrude D.

===Concept Entertainment===
Ownership of Gypsy transferred to Concept Entertainment in 1992. The company owned other Portland establishments such as Dixie Tavern, Grand Central Bowl, the Lotus and the Thirsty Lion.<ref name=Closed/> According to ''[[Willamette Week]]'', the business had an "odd" influence on local alcohol policies.<ref name=Closed/> In 1994, [[Charlie Hales]] and [[Vera Katz]], then serving as City Commissioner and [[List of mayors of Portland, Oregon|Mayor]], respectively, sought to close the business due to assaults, signs of drunkenness by patrons, and noise complaints. However, the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] (OLCC) refused.<ref name=Closed/><ref name=Mesh>{{Cite news|url=http://wweek.com/portland/article-20440-take_it_inside.html|title=Take It Inside: The City's Latest Bar Brawl with the OLCC: How Late Can Patios Stay Open?|accessdate=February 27, 2014|first=Aaron|last=Mesh|work=Willamette Week|location=Portland, Oregon|date=March 27, 2013|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers}}</ref> In 2013, after Hales had resumed office as Mayor, he unsuccessfully requested that the OLCC enforce a 10pm curfew for bar patios within the Portland city limits.<ref name=Closed/><ref name=Mesh/>

In 2010, in an attempt to offer "something different and exciting to do",<ref name=Fish>{{cite news|title=Go, Fish! Go!

Two other establishments owned by Concept Entertainment also hosted goldfish races.<ref name=Fish/> Gypsy's cross-shaped track was {{convert|9|ft|m}} long and "tricked out with fancy runway lights".<ref name=Fish/> The tournaments prompted criticism by a local veterinarian and a spokesperson for the Oregon Humane Society, who suggested they "may skirt the line of the humane society's guiding principle, which is to not inflict pain and suffering on animals for enjoyment".<ref name=Fish/> Furthermore, the spokesperson said, "I do wish people could find different ways to entertain themselves."<ref name=Closed/>

After operating for more than twenty years, and despite having advertised future events at the club, the business closed abruptly on February 20, 2014.<ref name=Closed/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2014/02/se_portlands_lily_day_cafe_reo.html|title=S.E.

The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.<ref name=Closed/>
