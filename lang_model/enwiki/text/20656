[[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Vernon Ashton Hobart Sturdee''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order (United Kingdom)|DSO]] (16 April 1890&nbsp;<U+2013> 25 May 1966) was an [[Australian Army]] commander who served two terms as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. A regular officer of the [[Royal Australian Engineers]] who joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] in 1908, he was one of the original [[Anzac]]s during the [[First World War]], participating in the [[Landing at Anzac Cove|landing at Gallipoli]] on 25 April 1915. In the [[Gallipoli Campaign|campaign]] that followed, he commanded the 5th Field Company, before going on to lead the 8th Field Company and 4th Pioneer Battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1918 he was seconded to General Headquarters (GHQ) [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] as a staff officer.

Promotion was stagnant between the wars, and Sturdee remained at his wartime rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] until 1935. He served in a series of staff posts, and attended the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College]] at [[Quetta]] in [[British India]] and the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in Britain. Like other regular officers, he had little faith in the government's "[[Singapore strategy]]", and warned that the Army would have to face an effective and well-equipped [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] opponent.

Ranked [[colonel]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, Sturdee was raised to [[lieutenant general]] in 1940 and became Chief of the General Staff. He proceeded to conduct a doomed defence of the islands to the north of Australia against the advancing Japanese forces. In 1942, he successfully advised the government to divert the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] troops returning from the [[Middle East]] to Australia. He then became head of the Australian Military Mission to [[Washington, DC]], where he represented Australia before the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]]. As commander of the [[First Army (Australia)|First Army]] in New Guinea in 1944<U+2013>45, Sturdee directed the fighting at [[Aitape-Wewak campaign|Aitape]], and on [[New Britain campaign|New Britain]] and [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]]. He was charged with destroying the enemy when opportunity presented itself, but had to do so with limited resources, and without committing his troops to battles that were beyond their strength.

When the war ended, Sturdee took the surrender of Japanese forces in the [[Rabaul]] area. As one of the Army's most senior officers, he succeeded [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] as Commander in Chief of the [[Australian Military Forces]] in December 1945. He became the Chief of the General Staff a second time in 1946, serving in the post until his retirement in 1950. During this term, he had to demobilise the wartime Army while providing and supporting the Australian contingent of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan. He developed a structure for the post-war Army that included regular combat formations. As a result, the Australian Regular Army was formed, laying the foundations for the service as it exists today.

==Education and early life==
Vernon Ashton Hobart Sturdee was born in [[Frankston, Victoria]], on 16 April 1890, the son of Alfred Hobart Sturdee and his wife Laura Isabell, n<U+00E9>e Merrett.<ref name="adb">{{harvnb|Wood|2002|pp=340<U+2013>342}}</ref> Alfred Sturdee, a medical practitioner from England, came from a prominent naval family and was the brother of [[Doveton Sturdee]], who later became an [[admiral of the fleet]].

==First World War==

===Gallipoli===
[[File:Sturdee at Anzac.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Soldier in peaked cap and puttees outside a sandbagged entrance.|Sturdee outside a dugout at Anzac.]]
Sturdee joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) on 25 August 1914 with the rank of lieutenant. He was promoted to captain on 18 October,<ref name="gradation list"/> and appointed [[adjutant]] of the 1st Division Engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|McNicoll|1979|p=19}}</ref> He embarked from Melbourne for Egypt on the former [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] [[ocean liner]] [[RMS Orvieto|RMS ''Orvieto'']] on 21 October 1914.<ref>{{citation |title=First World War Embarkation Roll&nbsp;<U+2013> Vernon Ashton Hobart Sturdee |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/nominal_rolls/first_world_war_embarkation/person.asp?p=70903 |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> He participated in the [[landing at Anzac Cove]] on [[Anzac Day|25 April 1915]],<ref name="DSO rec">{{citation |title=Honours and Awards&nbsp;<U+2013> Vernon Ashton Hobart Sturdee&nbsp;<U+2013> Distinguished Service Order |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/82/0065.pdf |accessdate=23 November 2009 |publisher=Australian War Memorial}}</ref> disembarking from the transport {{SS|Minnewaska|1909|6}} before 9:00.<ref name="Buckley, p. 44">{{harvnb|Buckley|1990|p=44}}</ref> His duties included supervising the engineer stores park on the beach at [[Anzac Cove]],<ref name="DSO rec"/> as well as the construction of [[Jam Tin Grenade]]s.<ref name="Buckley, p. 44" /> He was evacuated twice for hospital treatment for [[enteric fever]] and for serious damage to his stomach lining from internal burns as a result of too much "[[Condy's crystals]]" being put into drinking water.

Sturdee was promoted to [[major]] on 28 August 1915,<ref name="gradation list"/> and in September assumed command of the 5th Field Company, a unit raised in Egypt to support the newly formed [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]].<ref>{{harvnb|McNicoll|1979|p=43}}</ref> From then until the end of the campaign, he was responsible for all [[Military engineer|engineering]] and [[Mining (military)|mining]] work at Steele's, Quinn's and Courtney's Posts,<ref name="DSO rec"/> three of the northernmost and most dangerous and exposed parts of the line.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=46<U+2013>47}}</ref>  He departed Anzac Cove for the last time on 17 December 1915, two days before the final evacuation.<ref name="Buckley, p. 47">{{harvnb|Buckley|1990|p=47}}</ref>

===Western Front===
On returning to Egypt after the evacuation of Anzac, Sturdee assumed responsibility for the provision of hutting at the AIF reinforcement camp at [[Tall al Kabir|Tel el Kebir]].<ref name="DSO rec"/> There was already another 5th Field Company in Egypt, which had been raised in Australia. Accordingly, Sturdee's 5th Field Company was renumbered 8th, and assigned to the [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]] when it was formed in February 1916. This move gave the new division an experienced field company, but at the expense of items of the company's mail going to France for a time and arriving back in Egypt marked "Not Fifth, try Eighth."<ref>{{harvnb|McNicoll|1979|p=60}}</ref>

[[File:4th Pioneer Battalion E00468.jpeg|left|thumb|300px|B Company, 4th Pioneer Battalion shifts camp from the Butte de Warlencourt to Fremicourt by light railway.]]
The 5th Division moved to France in June 1916, where it participated in the disastrous [[Battle of Fromelles]] in July. During the action, Sturdee's 8th Field Company supported the [[8th Brigade (Australia)|8th Infantry Brigade]]. A trench dug by the former facilitated the latter's withdrawal across [[no man's land]].<ref name="DSO rec"/> For his service at Gallipoli and Fromelles, he was [[mentioned in despatches]],<ref name="mid1">{{LondonGazette|issue=29890|supp=yes|startpage=254|date=4 January 1917|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (MID)</ref> and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Order]].<ref name="dso">{{LondonGazette|issue=29886|supp=yes|startpage=28|date=1 January 1917|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (DSO)</ref> Heavy losses in the fighting at Fromelles prevented the 5th Division from participating in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. To free up another division to participate, [[II Anzac Corps]] organised "Franks Force" to take over a divisional frontage in the [[Houplines]] sector, and Sturdee became its Commander Royal Engineers (CRE).<ref>{{harvnb|McNicoll|1979|p=74}}</ref> When the 5th Division finally moved to the Somme sector in November, he became CRE in charge of the road from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]] to [[Montauban]].<ref>{{harvnb|McNicoll|1979|p=76}}</ref>

On 13 February 1917, Sturdee was appointed to command the 4th Pioneer Battalion, with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref name="gradation list"/> [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]] battalions were organised as infantry but contained a high percentage of tradesmen and were employed on construction tasks under engineer supervision. Over the next nine months the 4th Pioneer Battalion maintained roads, built camps, laid cables and dug trenches and dugouts.<ref name="adb"/> By 1917, the Australian government was pushing strongly for [[British Army]] officers holding Australian commands and staff posts to be replaced by Australians. As part of this "Australianisation" of the [[Australian Corps]], Sturdee became CRE of the 5th Division on 25 November 1917, replacing a British Army officer.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1937|pp=14<U+2013>16}}</ref> On 27 March 1918, Sturdee was seconded to General Headquarters (GHQ) [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] as a staff officer, remaining there until 22 October 1918.<ref name="gradation list"/> This provided a rare opportunity, for an Australian officer, of observing the workings of a major headquarters engaged in active operations.<ref name="adb"/> For his service on the Western Front, Sturdee was mentioned in despatches a second time,<ref name="mid2">{{LondonGazette|issue=31089|supp=yes|startpage=15225|date=31 December 1918|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (MID)</ref> and appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for his work at GHQ.<ref name="obe">{{LondonGazette|issue=31092|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=28 May 1918|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (OBE)</ref>

==Between the wars==
Sturdee embarked for Australia on 16 November 1918,<ref>{{citation |title=First World War Nominal Roll Page&nbsp;<U+2013> AWM133, 50<U+2013>093 |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/nominal_rolls/first_world_war/page.asp?p=1656086 |accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref> and his AIF appointment was terminated on 14 March 1919.<ref name="adb"/> He was entitled to his AIF rank of lieutenant colonel as an honorary rank, but his substantive rank was still only that of a captain. He was given the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920, but this did not become substantive until 1 April 1932. Sturdee initially served as Senior Engineer Officer on the staff of the [[3rd Military District (Australia)|3rd Military District]] at [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne]]. In 1921, he attended the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College]] at [[Quetta]] in [[British India]]. He was an instructor in military engineering and surveying at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] from 16 February to 31 December 1924, before returning to Melbourne to serve on the staff of the [[4th Division (Australia)|4th Division]] until 26 March 1929. Posted to the [[United Kingdom]], he served at the [[War Office]] and attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in 1931. From 1 January 1931 to 31 December 1932, he was the military representative at the [[High Commission of Australia in London]].<ref name="gradation list"/>

Sturdee was Director of Military Operations and Intelligence at Army Headquarters in Melbourne from 14 February 1933 to 1 March 1938, a period "when the Army was at rock bottom",<ref>{{harvnb|Rowell|1974|p=30}}</ref> and then served as Director of Staff Duties until 12 October 1938. He was given the brevet rank of colonel on 1 July 1935; this became temporary on 1 July 1936 and finally substantive on 1 July 1937, over twenty years after he had become a lieutenant colonel in the AIF.<ref name="gradation list"/> He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[New Year Honours]] in 1939 for his services on the Army Headquarters staff.<ref name="cbe">{{LondonGazette|issue=34585|supp=yes|startpage=8|date=1 January 1939|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (CBE)</ref>

Like his predecessor as Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, Colonel [[John Lavarack]], and many other officers, Sturdee had little faith in the government's "[[Singapore strategy]]", which aimed to deter Japanese aggression through the presence of a powerful British fleet based at [[Singapore]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1983|p=30}}</ref> In 1933, Sturdee told senior officers that the Japanese {{quote|would all be regulars, fully trained and equipped for the operations, and fanatics who like dying in battle, whilst our troops would consist mainly of civilians hastily thrown together on mobilisation with very little training, short of artillery and possibly of gun ammunition.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1978|p=16}}</ref>}}

==Second World War==

===Defence of Australia===
In 1939, the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]], [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ernest Squires]], implemented a reorganisation of the Army in which the old military districts were replaced by larger commands led by [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|lieutenant general]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Rowell|1974|p=40}},</ref> On 13 October 1939, Sturdee was promoted from colonel to lieutenant general and assumed control of the new Eastern Command.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1984|p=145}}</ref> He had to supervise the raising, training and equipping of the new [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] units being formed in [[New South Wales]], as well as the now-conscript Militia.<ref name="adb"/>

On 1 July 1940, Sturdee accepted a demotion to [[Major General (Australia)|major general]] in order to become the commander of Second AIF's newly raised [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]], receiving the Second AIF serial number NX35000.<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=28}}</ref> His period in this command was brief. On 13 August 1940, the Chief of the General Staff, [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Brudenell White]], was killed in the [[Canberra air disaster, 1940|Canberra air disaster]]. Sturdee was restored to his rank of lieutenant general and appointed Chief of the General Staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=32}}</ref> As such, he was responsible for the training and maintenance of the AIF in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Far East]]<U+2014>although not their operational control<U+2014>and for the administration and training of the Militia.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1978|p=24}}</ref>

As the prospect of war with Japan became more likely, so also did the need to make appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a [[Commander in Chief]]. In April 1941, the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for the Army]], [[Percy Spender]], recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the [[Australian Military Forces]]. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]] as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir [[Iven Mackay]] was appointed to this newly created post.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1978|pp=24<U+2013>25}}</ref> However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Sunday Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' advocated the appointment.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1978|pp=54<U+2013>55}}</ref>

===East Indies campaign===
Sturdee attempted to defend the islands to the north of Australia as best he could. With only one AIF infantry brigade available, the [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd]], he could only afford to protect the islands most strategically important to the defence of Australia. He sent the 2/21st Infantry Battalion to [[Ambon Island|Ambon]],<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=418<U+2013>419}}</ref> the 2/22nd to [[Rabaul]],<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=394<U+2013>395}}</ref> and the [[2/40th Battalion (Australia)|2/40th Infantry Battalion]] and [[2/2nd Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/2nd Independent Company]] to [[Timor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=467<U+2013>468}}</ref> Sturdee knew that their prospects were slim but expected them to "to put up the best possible defence" with what resources they had, and hopefully slow the Japanese advance to allow time for reinforcements to arrive in Australia. When there were doubts about the morale of one commander, Sturdee replaced him with a staff officer from Army Headquarters who volunteered for the position despite being well aware of the odds.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1984|pp=152<U+2013>153}}</ref> All the garrisons were overrun after a spirited defence, except for the 2/2nd Independent Company, which managed to hold on in [[East Timor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=493<U+2013>494}}</ref>

In February 1942, on advice from Lavarack that the [[Dutch East Indies]] would soon fall, Sturdee urged the Australian government that the 17,800 troops returning from the Middle East, originally bound for [[Java]], be diverted to Australia. Sturdee contended that Java could not be held, and that Allied resources should instead be concentrated in an area from which an offensive could be launched. The best place for this, he argued, was Australia. When [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] backed his Chief of the General Staff, it brought him into conflict with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In the end, Curtin won his point, and subsequent events vindicated Sturdee's appreciation of the situation.<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=444<U+2013>452}}</ref> Official historian Lionel Wigmore concluded: {{quote|It is now evident that the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] would have arrived only in time to help in the extraction from [[Pegu]] and to take part in the long retreat to India. In that event it could not have been returned to Australia, rested and sent to [[New Guinea]] in time to perform the crucial role it was to carry out in the defeat of the Japanese offensive which would open there in July, 1942. The Allied cause therefore was well served in sound judgement and solid persistence of General Sturdee who maintained his advice against that of the Chiefs of Staff in London and Washington.<ref>{{harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=45}}</ref>}}

===Island campaigns===

In March 1942, the Military Board was abolished and General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] was appointed Commander in Chief.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1978|pp=55<U+2013>57}}</ref> Blamey decided that after the hectic events of the previous months, Sturdee needed a rest and appointed him as Head of the Australian Military Mission to [[Washington, DC]], where the war's strategy was now being decided. Sturdee accepted on condition that after a year's duty in Washington he would be appointed to an important command.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1978|p=99}}</ref> In Washington, Sturdee represented Australia before the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] and managed to obtain the right of direct access to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]].<ref name="adb"/> For his services as Chief of the General Staff, Sturdee was made a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 1 January 1943.<ref name="cb">{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|startpage=3|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (CB)</ref>

Sturdee returned to Australia and assumed command of the [[First Army (Australia)|First Army]] on 1 March 1944.<ref name="gradation list"/> His headquarters was initially located in [[Queensland]], but on 2 October 1944 it commenced operations in [[Lae]], and Sturdee assumed command of the troops in [[New Guinea]]. These included Lieutenant General [[Stanley Savige]]'s [[II Corps (Australia)|II Corps]], with its headquarters at [[Torokina]] on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]; Major General [[Alan Ramsay]]'s [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]] on [[New Britain]]; Major General [[Jack Stevens]]' [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]] at [[Aitape]]; and the [[8th Brigade (Australia)|8th Infantry Brigade]] west of [[Madang]]. On 18 October, Blamey issued an operational instruction that defined the role of the First Army: "by offensive action to destroy enemy resistance as opportunity offers without committing major forces."<ref name="Long, p. 25">{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=25}}</ref>

Sturdee was concerned by this order's ambiguity and sought clarification from Blamey. The Commander in Chief responded by stating that "my conception is that action must be of a gradual nature" involving the use of patrols to determine Japanese strengths and positions before large offensives were undertaken.<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|1983|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref> The situation on New Britain was straightforward enough; the enemy was known to be stronger than the Australian forces there<U+2014>although it was not realised just how much stronger<U+2014>and so the best that could be done was to eliminate small numbers of Japanese troops by aggressive patrolling.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=240<U+2013>241}}</ref> At Aitape, Stevens was tasked on the one hand with pushing the Japanese back far enough to protect the airfields;<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=271<U+2013>272}}</ref> but on the other, with not allowing the 6th Division to become heavily engaged since it might be required for use elsewhere. On Bougainville, Savige had the strength and ability to conduct a major campaign, but Blamey counselled caution.<ref name="Long, p. 25"/>

Juggling a number of contradictory requirements, Sturdee had to conduct three widely separated campaigns, the [[Aitape-Wewak campaign]], the [[New Britain campaign]] and the [[Bougainville Campaign]], and do so with limited resources. Shipping, which was controlled by [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s GHQ [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], was a source of "continual anxiety".<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=89}}</ref> On 18 July 1945, Sturdee wrote to Savige:
{{quote|We are on rather a hair trigger with operations in Bougainville and in 6 Division area in view of the political hostility of the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] and the Press criticism of the policy of operations being followed in these areas. The general policy is out of our hands, but we must conduct our operations in the spirit of the role given us by C. in C. [Blamey], the main essence of which is that we should attain our object with a minimum of Australian casualties. We have in no way been pressed on the time factor and to date have managed to defeat the Japs with very reasonable casualties considering the number of the Japs that have been eliminated.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=218}}</ref>}}
Sturdee's operations were effective. On Bougainville, at a cost of 516 Australian dead and 1,572 wounded, Savige's troops had occupied much of the island and killed 8,500 Japanese; another 9,800 died from malnutrition and disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=237<U+2013>238}}</ref> On New Britain, where 74 Australians died and 140 were wounded, the heavily outnumbered 5th Division had overrun central New Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=269<U+2013>270}}</ref> Meanwhile, the 6th Division at Aitape and Wewak had lost 442 dead and 1,141 wounded while clearing the Japanese from the coast and driving them into the mountains, killing 9,000 and taking 269 prisoners.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=385<U+2013>386}}</ref>

On 6 September 1945, Sturdee received the surrender of Japanese forces in the First Army area from General [[Hitoshi Imamura]], the commander of the [[Japanese Eighth Area Army]], and Admiral [[Jinichi Kusaka]], the commander of the South East Area Fleet, in a ceremony held on the deck of the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} at Rabaul. The two Japanese swords handed over in the surrender ceremony, together with the sword worn by Sturdee, which was his father's, were presented to the [[Australian War Memorial]] by Lady Sturdee in 1982.<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1983|p=37}}</ref> For his service in the final campaigns, Blamey recommended Sturdee for a knighthood,<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|1998|p=559}}</ref> but this was reduced to a third mention in despatches.<ref name="mid3">{{LondonGazette|issue=37898|startpage=1091|supp=yes|date=6 March 1947|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (MID)</ref>

==Later life==
In November 1945, the Minister for the Army, [[Frank Forde]], informed Blamey that the government had decided to re-establish the Military Board and he should therefore vacate his office. Sturdee became acting Commander in Chief on 1 December 1945. On 1 March 1946, the post of Commander in Chief was abolished and Sturdee became Chief of the General Staff again.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=579}}</ref> There was much work to be done; the wartime Army had a strength of 383,000 in August 1945, of whom 177,000 were serving outside Australia.<ref>{{harvnb|Sligo|1997|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref>

These troops had to be demobilised, but what should replace the wartime Army had not yet been determined.  Sturdee and his Vice Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General [[Sydney Rowell]], had to develop an appropriate structure. The proposal submitted to [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] called for [[national service]], a regular army of 33,000 and reserves of 42,000, but the government baulked at the <U+00A3>20m per annum price tag. A smaller force of 19,000 regulars and 50,000 reservists at a cost of <U+00A3>12.5m per annum was finally approved in 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Sligo|1997|pp=34<U+2013>35}}</ref> Conditions of service were also overhauled.<ref>{{harvnb|Sligo|1997|pp=40<U+2013>42}}</ref>

At the same time, the Army had to handle huge stockpiles of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far in excess of the Army's needs and had to be deposed of. Hospitals still had to be run, although some were transferred to the [[Department of Veterans' Affairs|Department of Repatriation]]. The Army had to maintain its schools and training establishments. Moreover, the Army had to field and maintain part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan.<ref>{{harvnb|Rowell|1974|pp=160<U+2013>164}}</ref> Over next fifty years, operations would be conducted by the new [[Australian Regular Army]] that Sturdee created, rather than the Militia or specially enlisted expeditionary forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Sligo|1997|p=47}}</ref>

Sturdee retired on 17 April 1950. In recognition of his services, he was created a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1 January 1951.<ref name="kbe">{{LondonGazette|issue=39105|supp=yes|startpage=36|date=1 January 1951|accessdate=24 November 2009}} (KBE)</ref> In retirement, he continued to live in [[Kooyong, Melbourne]]. He became a director of the Australian arm of [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] and was honorary colonel of the [[Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] from 1951 to 1956. The Army named the [[Landing Ship Medium]] [[Australian landing ship medium Vernon Sturdee (AV 1355)|''Vernon Sturdee'']] after him. He died on 25 May 1966 at the [[Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg]]. He was accorded a funeral with full military honours, and cremated.<ref name="adb"/> Lieutenant General Sir [[Edmund Herring]], a boyhood friend from Melbourne Grammar, was principal pall bearer.<ref>{{harvnb|Buckley|1990|p=50}}</ref> Sturdee was survived by his wife, their daughter and one of their two sons. Before he died, he burned all his private papers. "I have done the job," he said. "It is over."<ref name="adb"/>
