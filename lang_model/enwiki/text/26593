The '''United States Air Force''' ('''USAF''') is the [[aerial warfare]] service branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and one of the [[uniformed services of the United States|American uniformed services]]. Initially part of the [[United States Army]], the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on September 18, 1947 under the [[National Security Act of 1947]].<ref name=Factsheet2>{{cite web |author=United States Air Force |title=The U.S. Air Force |url=http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2 |work=United States Air Force website |publisher=U.S. Air Force |location=[[Washington, DC]] |month=September |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref> It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, as well as the world's most technologically sophisticated air force. The USAF articulates its core functions in its ''2010 Posture Statement'' as [[Nuclear deterrence|Nuclear Deterrence Operations]], [[Air Force Special Operations Command|Special Operations]], [[Air supremacy|Air Superiority]], [[Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance|Global Integrated ISR]], [[Space Superiority Systems Wing|Space Superiority]], [[Command and control|Command and Control]], [[Twenty-Fourth Air Force|Cyberspace Superiority]], [[Air Rescue Service|Personnel Recovery]], [[Prompt Global Strike|Global Precision Attack]], [[Military advisor|Building Partnerships]], [[Air Mobility Command|Rapid Global Mobility]] and [[Combat service support|Agile Combat Support]].<ref>[http://www.posturestatement.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100223-010.pdf 2010 United States Air Force Posture Statement]. USAF, 9 February 2010.</ref>

{{As of|2009}} the USAF operates 5,573 manned aircraft in service (3,990 USAF; 1,213 [[Air National Guard]]; and 370 [[Air Force Reserve]]);<ref name="AF_Almanac">[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Magazine%20Documents/2009/May%202009/0509facts_fig.pdf "2009 Air Force Almanac"].

The USAF has 330,159 personnel on [[active duty]], 68,872 in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|Selected and Individual Ready Reserves]], and 94,753 in the [[Air National Guard]] as of September 2008. In addition, the USAF employs 151,360 civilian personnel,<ref>[http://www.airmanonline.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100302-029.pdf "Airman Magazine: The Book 2010 - Personnel Facts and Figures"]. ''Airman Magazine'', Volume 54 Number 3, p. 46.</ref>  and has over 60,000 auxiliary members in the [[Civil Air Patrol]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.gocivilairpatrol.com/media/cms/CAP_Fact_Sheet_09_09_B1C2398575B72.pdf |title=CAP Fact Sheet at August 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> making it the largest air force in the world.

The [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] is headed by the civilian [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]], who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], and has the authority to conduct all of its affairs, subject to the authority, direction and control of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. The Department of the Air Force is a ''Military Department'' within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and it includes all elements of the United States Air Force, i.e. the technical designation of the ''U.S. Air Force organization''. The highest ranking military officer in the Department of the Air Force is the [[Chief of Staff of the Air Force]] who exercises supervision over Air Force units, and serves as a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. Air Force combat forces are assigned, as directed by the Secretary of Defense, to the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commander]]s, and neither the Secretary of the Air Force nor the Chief of Staff have operational command authority over them.

The core values of the Air Force are: 1) Integrity First; 2) Service Before Self; and 3) Excellence In All We Do. 

==Mission==
According to the [[National Security Act of 1947]] (61 ''Stat''. 502), which created the USAF:
<blockquote>
:''In general the United States Air Force shall include [[aviation]] forces both [[combat]] and service not otherwise assigned. It shall be organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive air operations. The Air Force shall be responsible for the preparation of the air forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as otherwise assigned and, in accordance with integrated joint mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war.''
</blockquote>

<U+00A7>8062 of Title 10 US Code defines the purpose of the USAF as:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00008062----000-.html |title=10 USC 8062 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>
*to preserve the peace and security, and provide for the defense, of the United States, the Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions, and any areas occupied by the United States;
*to support national policy;
*to implement national objectives;
*to overcome any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States.

The stated mission of the USAF today is to "fly, fight, and win in air, space, and cyberspace".<ref>Air Force Link, (2008). ''[http://www.af.mil/main/welcome.asp]''. Retrieved 21 September 2008.</ref>

===Operational functions===

The Air Force describes its mission in terms of 17 operational functions:<ref>Air Force Doctrine Document 1. ''[http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFDD1.pdf]''. 17 November 2003.</ref>

*'''Strategic Attack''' <U+2013> offensive action that most directly achieves national security objectives by affecting the adversary<U+2019>s leadership, conflict-sustaining resources and strategy.
*'''Counter-air''' <U+2013> operations to attain and maintain a desired degree of [[air superiority]] by the destruction, degradation, or disruption of enemy forces.  Counter-air takes the form of both [[offensive counter air]] against enemy air and missile power at its source, and defensive counter-air against attacking enemy air and missiles over friendly territory.
*'''Counter-space''' <U+2013> destruction, degradation or disruption of enemy space capability.
*'''Counter-land''' <U+2013> air and space operations against enemy land forces, including ''[[air interdiction]]'' to divert, disrupt, delay, or destroy the enemy<U+2019>s surface military potential before it can be used effectively against friendly forces, and ''[[close air support]]'' to help friendly surface forces in contact with enemy forces.
*'''Counter-sea''' <U+2013> tasks including sea surveillance, anti-ship and [[anti-submarine warfare]], aerial [[minelaying]], and [[air refueling]] in support of naval campaigns.
*'''[[Information Operations]]''' <U+2013> actions taken to influence, affect, or defend information, systems, and/or decision-making, through ''influence'', ''[[network-centric warfare|network warfare]]'', and ''[[electronic warfare]]'' operations.
*'''Combat Support''' <U+2013> capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to create and sustain air and space forces, including the procurement, maintenance, distribution, and replacement of personnel and [[materiel]].
*'''[[Command and Control]]''' <U+2013> exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission, including both process and systems.
*'''[[Airlift]]''' <U+2013> transportation of personnel and materiel through the air.
*'''[[Aerial refueling|Air Refueling]]''' <U+2013> in-flight transfer of fuel between tanker and receiver aircraft.
*'''Space-lift''' <U+2013> delivery of satellites, payloads and materiel to space.
*'''[[Special Operations]]''' <U+2013> airpower conducting unconventional warfare, direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, psychological operations, and counter-proliferation.
*'''Intelligence''' <U+2013> product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, analysis, evaluation and interpretation of available information concerning foreign countries or areas.
*'''[[Surveillance]] and [[Reconnaissance]]''' <U+2013> systematic observation of air, space, surface, or subsurface areas, places, persons, or things, by visual, aural, electronic, photographic, or other means.  ''Surveillance'' is a continuing process, not oriented to a specific target, while ''reconnaissance'' looks for specific information and generally has a time constraint.
*'''[[Combat Search and Rescue]]''' <U+2013> recovery of isolated personnel with rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft.
*'''[[Navigation]] and Positioning''' <U+2013> provision of accurate location and time of reference.
*'''Weather Services''' <U+2013> environmental information, including both space environment and atmospheric weather.

===Search and rescue===
{{See also|United States Air Force Rescue Coordination Center}}

The National Search and Rescue Plan designates the [[United States Coast Guard]] as the federal agency responsible for ''maritime'' search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, and the USAF as responsible for aeronautical SAR in the continental U.S. with the exception of Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-o/g-opr/nsarc/NSARC%20-%20Natl%20SAR%20Plan%20(2007%20-%20Final).pdf |title=National Search and Rescue Plan (USA) 2007 |publisher=Uscg.mil |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> Both agencies maintain [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centers]] to coordinate this effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-o/g-opr/nsarc/nsarc.htm |title=USCG Office of Search & Rescue (CG-534) |publisher=Uscg.mil |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>  To help the USAF with the vast number of search and rescue operations, the USAF assigns units of the [[Civil Air Patrol]] <U+2014> the official U.S. Air Force Auxiliary <U+2014> in over 91% of inland search and rescue missions.

===Air sovereignty===
The USAF, through the [[Air National Guard]], is the lead agency to maintain control of America's airspace.

On July 30, 2009, Lt. Gen. Harry Wyatt, director of the Air National Guard said that "Technologies needed for the mission include an active, electronically scanned array radar (which can be used to detect small and stealthy air threats including cruise missiles), infrared search and track systems and beyond-line-of-sight communications".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/jsp_includes/articlePrint.jsp?storyID=news/FIGHT07299.xml&headLine=U.S.%20Air%20National%20Guard%20Struggles%20With%20Fighter%20Gap |title=U.S. Air National Guard Struggles With Fighter Gap |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

On September 14, 2009, Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, chief of staff of the USAF, said that he hopes "to bring a combination of F-22, F-35, legacy aircraft, including upgraded F-15 and F-16 fighters, and unmanned aircraft to the [air sovereignty alert] ASA mission."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvidshub.net/?script=news/news_show.php&id=38740 |title=Air Force Chief Calls for Collaboration Between Guard, Active Duty |publisher=Dvidshub.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

Even so, the USAF plans to retire up to 80% of their total force air sovereignty mission aircraft, which would leave no usable aircraft at 18 current air sovereignty sites after 2015.<ref name="aviationweek.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aerospacedaily&id=news/SOVER042309.xml |title=Questions On U.S. Air Sovereignty Mission |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=43334&dcn=todaysnews |title=Air Force urged to consider Navy F-18s |publisher=Govexec.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=This story was written by Master Sgt.

The USAF has decided to accept "moderate risk" for the air sovereignty mission as well as deep strike and close air support, under optimistic assumptions for F-35 production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/asd/2010/04/26/13.xml&headline=USAF%20Fighter%20Shortfall%20Smaller%20Than%20Expected |title=USAF Fighter Shortfall Smaller Than Expected |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> The GAO found that the Air Force used dated material to provide these reports to the Congress.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-323R?source=ra "GAO-11-323R Tactical Aircraft: Air Force Fighter Reports Generally Addressed Congressional Mandates, but Reflected Dated Plans and Guidance, and Limited Analyses"] ''[[GAO]]'', 24 February 2011.</ref>

The Defense Department has used USN and USMC aircraft for the Air Sovereignty Mission and may do so in the future.<ref name="aviationweek.com"/>

===Irregular warfare===
In response to the conflicts in which the United States has been engaged since the end of the Cold War, on August 1, 2007, Air Force Doctrine Document 2-3 was released showing how air power could be used to support or defeat an insurgency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/usaf/afdd2-3.pdf |title=AFDD 2-3 Irregular Warfare |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

To support these missions, the USAF considered outfitting a counter-insurgency wing with small, ground attack aircraft that can also be used for training USAF and allied pilots in addition to counterinsurgency operations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Colin |url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/2009/04/24/af-mulls-coin-wing-new-planes/ |title=AF Mulls COIN Wing, New Planes |publisher=Dodbuzz.com |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>  However the 2010 QDR shifted the future light fixed-wing aircraft to the Air Force<U+2019>s 6th Special Operations Squadron to be used to train allied forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/qdr/images/QDR_as_of_12Feb10_1000.pdf |title=2010 QDR |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

===Airlift===
The USAF provides both strategic and tactical airlift in support of wartime, peacetime, and humanitarian efforts of the Department of Defense.

The GAO found that Air Force plans should cover strategic airlift, but that it may fall short in providing tactical airlift in support of the United States Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-67 |title=Defense Acquisitions: Strategic Airlift Gap Has Been Addressed, but Tactical Airlift Plans Are Evolving as Key Issues Have Not Been Resolved |publisher=Gao.gov |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the United States Air Force}}

The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] created the first antecedent of the Air Force in 1907, which through a succession of changes of organization, titles, and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later. The Air Force came of age in [[World War II]]. Almost 68,000 U.S airmen died helping to win the war, only the infantry suffered more enlisted casualties.<ref>Robert Pitta, Gordon Rottman, Jeff Fannell (1993). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ydRaKBTQ0AgC&pg=PA3&dq=&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false US Army Air Force (1)]''". Osprey Publishing. p.3. ISBN 1855322951</ref> In practice, the USAAF was virtually independent of the [[United States Army|Army]] during World War II, but officials wanted formal independence. The USAF became a separate military service on September 18, 1947, with the implementation of the [[National Security Act of 1947]].<ref>U.S. Intelligence Community (October 2004). ''[http://www.intelligence.gov/0-natsecact_1947.shtml National Security Act of 1947]''. Retrieved 14 April 2006.</ref> The Act created the ''National Military Establishment'' (renamed [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] in 1949), which was composed of three subordinate Military Departments, namely the [[Department of the Army]], the [[Department of the Navy]] and a newly-created '''[[Department of the Air Force]]'''.<ref>U.S. Department of State. ''[http://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/NationalSecurityAct National Security Act of 1947]''. Retrieved: 3 October 2010.</ref> Prior to 1947, the responsibility for military aviation was shared between the Army (for land-based operations), the [[United States Navy|Navy]] (for sea-based operations from [[aircraft carrier]]s and [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] aircraft), and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] (for close air support of infantry operations).

The predecessor organizations in the Army of today's Air Force are:
*[[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]] (August 1, 1907 to July 18, 1914)
*[[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] (July 18, 1914 to May 20, 1918)
*[[Division of Military Aeronautics]] (May 20, 1918 to May 24, 1918)
*[[U.S. Army Air Service]] (May 24, 1918 to July 2, 1926)
*[[U.S. Army Air Corps]] (July 2, 1926 to June 20, 1941) and
*[[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (June 20, 1941 to September 18, 1947)

===Recent history===
Since 2005, the USAF has placed a strong focus on the improvement of Basic Military Training (BMT). While the intense training has become longer it also has shifted to include a deployment phase. This deployment phase, now called the BEAST, places the trainees in a surreal environment that they may experience once they deploy. While the trainees do tackle the massive obstacle courses along with the BEAST, the other portions include defending and protecting their base of operations, forming a structure of leadership, directing search and recovery, and basic self aid buddy care. During this event, the Military Training Instructors (MTI) act as mentors and enemy forces in a deployment exercise.

In 2007, the USAF undertook a reduction-in-force. Because of budget constraints, the USAF planned to reduce the service's size from 360,000 active duty personnel to 316,000.<ref name="AF_mag_rif">[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2008/October%202008/1008aircraft.aspx Needed: 200 New Aircraft a Year], Air Force Magazine, October 2008.</ref> The size of the active-duty force in 2007 was roughly 64% of that of the USAF at the end of the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.<ref name="downsize">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Magazine%20Documents/2008/May%202008/0508facts_figs.pdf | title = 2008 USAF Almanac: People | format = PDF | work = | publisher = AIR FORCE Magazine}} 1991: 510,000; 2007: 328,600</ref>  However, the reduction was ended at approximately 330,000 personnel in 2008 to meet mission requirements.<ref name="AF_mag_rif"/>  These same constraints have seen a sharp reduction in flight hours for crew training since 2005<ref>[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2008/January 2008/0108scarce.aspx Scarce Flying Hours]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel directing Airmen's Time Assessments.<ref>{{cite web|author=This story was written by Maj.

On June 5, 2008, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert M. Gates]], accepted the resignations of both the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Michael W. Wynne]], and the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], Gen. [[T. Michael Moseley]].  Gates in effect fired both men for "systemic issues associated with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance".  This followed an investigation into two embarrassing incidents involving mishandling of [[nuclear weapons]], and were also the culmination of disputes between the Air Force leadership and Gates.<ref>[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2008/July%202008/0708watch.aspx "Washington watch"], ''AIR FORCE Magazine'', July 2008, Vol. 91 No. 7, pp. 8.</ref>  To put more emphasis on nuclear assets, the USAF established the nuclear-focused [[Air Force Global Strike Command]] on 24 October 2008.<ref>Chavanne, Bettina H.

In recent years the USAF has fumbled several high profile aircraft procurement projects, such as the failure to make the case for the [[Next-Generation Bomber]], the failure to control costs on the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] and the decade of failures on the [[KC-X]] program. [[Center for Defense Information|Winslow Wheeler]] has written that this pattern represents "failures of intellect and -- much more importantly -- ethics."<ref>Francis, Mike.

==Organization==
{{Main|Organizational structure and hierarchy of the United States Air Force|Structure of the United States armed forces#Department_of_the_Air_Force|l2=Department of the Air Force structure}}

===Administrative organization===

The [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] is one of three ''military departments'' within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and is managed by the civilian [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]], under the authority, direction, and control of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. The senior officials in the [[Office of the Secretary of the Air Force|Office of the Secretary]] are the [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force|Under Secretary of the Air Force]], four [[Assistant Secretary of the Air Force|Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force]] and the [[General Counsel of the Department of the Air Force|General Counsel]], all of whom are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The senior uniformed leadership in the [[Air Staff (United States)|Air Staff]] is made up of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]] and the [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force]].

The directly subordinate commands and units are named [[List of United States Air Force Field Operating Agencies|Field Operating Agency]] (FOA), [[Direct Reporting Unit]] (DRU), and the currently unused ''Separate Operating Agency''.

The [[List of Major Commands of the United States Air Force|Major Command]] (MAJCOM) is the superior hierarchical level of command. Including the [[Air Force Reserve Command]], as of September 30, 2006, USAF has ten major commands. The [[List of Numbered Air Forces of the United States Air Force|Numbered Air Force]] (NAF) is a level of command directly under the MAJCOM, followed by Operational Command ''(now unused)'', [[Air Division]] ''(also now unused)'', [[List of Wings of the United States Air Force|Wing]], [[List of United States Air Force Groups|Group]], [[List of United States Air Force squadrons|Squadron]], and Flight.

===Operational organization===
<!--[[Image:AF-Logo.svg|thumb|right|The official symbol of the USAF. The wings represent the enlisted force. The sphere within the star represents the globe. The star represents the officer corps. The three diamonds represent the USAF core values]]-->

[[List of active United States Air Force aircraft squadrons]]

The organizational structure as shown above is responsible for the peacetime organization, equipping, and training of aerospace units for operational missions. When required to support operational missions, the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] (SECDEF) directs the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] (SECAF) to execute a Change in Operational Control (CHOP) of these units from their administrative alignment to the operational command of a [[Unified Combatant Command|Regional]] [[Combatant commander|Combatant Commander]] (CCDR). In the case of AFSPC, AFSOC, PACAF, and USAFE units, forces are normally employed in-place under their existing CCDR. Likewise, AMC forces operating in support roles retain their componency to [[USTRANSCOM]] unless chopped to a Regional CCDR.

===Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force===
"Chopped" units are referred to as '''forces'''. The top-level structure of these forces is the [[Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force]] (AETF). The AETF is the Air Force presentation of forces to a CCDR for the employment of Air Power. Each CCDR is supported by a standing Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) to provide planning and execution of aerospace forces in support of CCDR requirements. Each C-NAF consists of a Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and AFFOR/A-staff, and an Air Operations Center (AOC). As needed to support multiple Joint Force Commanders (JFC) in the [[Unified Combatant Command|COCOM]]'s Area of Responsibility (AOR), the C-NAF may deploy Air Component Coordinate Elements (ACCE) to liaise with the JFC. If the Air Force possesses the preponderance of air forces in a JFC's area of operations, the COMAFFOR will also serve as the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC).

===Commander, Air Force Forces===
The Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is the senior USAF officer responsible for the employment of air power in support of JFC objectives. The COMAFFOR has a special staff and an A-Staff to ensure assigned or attached forces are properly organized, equipped, and trained to support the operational mission.

====Air Operations Center====
The [[Air Operations Center]] (AOC) is the JFACC's [[Command and Control (Military)|Command and Control]] (C2) center. This center is responsible for planning and executing air power missions in support of JFC objectives.

===Air Expeditionary Wings/Groups/Squadrons===
The AETF generates air power to support COCOM objectives from [[Air Expeditionary Wing]]s (AEW) or Air Expeditionary Groups (AEG). These units are responsible for receiving combat forces from Air Force MAJCOMs, preparing these forces for operational missions, launching and recovering these forces, and eventually returning forces to the MAJCOMs. Theater Air Control Systems control employment of forces during these missions.

==Personnel==
The classification of any USAF job is the [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC). They range from flight combat operations such as a gunner, to working in a dining facility to ensure that members are properly fed. There are many different jobs in fields such as computer specialties, mechanic specialties, [[Aircrew Badge#Air Force|enlisted aircrew]], communication systems, avionics technicians, medical specialties, civil engineering, public affairs, hospitality, law, drug counseling, mail operations, [[Air Force Security Forces|security forces]], and search and rescue specialties.<ref>[http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/publications/afsc_info.pdf] ''Air Force Specialty Code Information'', United States Air Force, July 2008.</ref>

Perhaps the most dangerous USAF jobs are [[Bomb disposal|Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD), [[Combat rescue officer]], [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Pararescue]], [[Air Force Security Forces|Security Forces]], [[Combat Control Team|Combat Control]], [[Air Force Special Operations Weather Technician|Combat Weather]], [[Tactical Air Control Party]], and [[AFOSI]] agents, who deploy with [[infantry]] and [[special operations]] units who disarm bombs, rescue downed or isolated personnel, call in [[air strike]]s and set up landing zones in forward locations. Most of these are [[enlisted]] positions.  Other jobs have seen increasing combat, including engineers, vehicle operators, and OSI.

Nearly all enlisted jobs are "entry level," meaning that the USAF provides all training. Some enlistees are able to choose a particular job, or at least a field before actually joining, while others are assigned an AFSC at Basic Military Training (BMT). After BMT, new airmen attend a technical training school where they learn their particular AFSC. Second Air Force, a part of Air Education and Training Command, is responsible for nearly all technical training.

Training programs vary in length; for example, 3M0X1 (Services) has 31 days of tech school training, while 3E8X1 (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) is one year of training with a preliminary school and a main school consisting of over 10 separate divisions, sometimes taking students close to two years to complete.

USAF rank is divided between [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] airmen, non-commissioned officers, and commissioned officers, and ranges from the enlisted Airman Basic (E-1) to the commissioned rank of [[General]] (O-10). Enlisted promotions are granted based on a combination of test scores, years of experience, and selection board approval while officer promotions are based on time-in-grade and a [[promotion board]]. Promotions among enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers are generally designated by increasing numbers of insignia chevrons. Commissioned officer rank is designated by bars, oak leaves, a silver eagle, and anywhere from one to four stars (one to five stars in war-time).

===Commissioned officers===
{{Main|United States Air Force officer rank insignia}}
The commissioned officer ranks of the USAF are divided into three sections: company grade, field grade, and general officers. Company grade officers are those officers in pay grades O-1 to O-3, while field grade officers are those in pay grades O-4 to O-6, and general officers are those in pay grades of O-7 and above.

Currently, promotion from Second Lieutenant to First Lieutenant is virtually guaranteed after two years of satisfactory service. The promotion from First Lieutenant to Captain is competitive after successfully completing another two years of service.  Promotion to Major and above is through a board process.  An officer's record is reviewed by a selection board at the Air Force Personnel Center at [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in San Antonio, Texas.  This process occurs approximately between the seven- and ten-year mark, where a certain percentage of Captains will be selected for Major. This process will repeat at the 11-14 year mark for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel, and then around the eighteen-year mark for promotion to Colonel.

The Air Force has the largest ratio of general officers to total strength of all of the armed forces and this ratio has increased as the force has shrunk from its [[Cold War]] highs.<ref>Schwellenbach, Nick.

===Warrant officers===
Although provision is made in [[Title 10 of the United States Code]] for the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] to appoint warrant officers, the Air Force does not currently use [[warrant officer]] grades, and is the only one of the [[U.S. Armed Services]] to do so.  The Air Force inherited warrant officer ranks from the [[United States Army|Army]] at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When the [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in 1958, Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new "super grades" could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level, although this was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959,<ref name="WO-5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usawoa.org/woheritage//WO_Prog_Other_Svc.htm|title=Warrant Officer Programs of Other Services|publisher=United States Army Warrant Officer Association|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> the same year the first promotions were made to the new top enlisted grade, [[Chief Master Sergeant]]. Most of the existing Air Force warrant officers entered the commissioned officer ranks during the 1960s, but tiny numbers continued to exist for the next 21 years.

The last active duty Air Force warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980 and the last Air Force Reserve warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryranks.us/us-military-warrant-officer.htm |title=Warrant Officers of the US Military |publisher=Militaryranks.us |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>  Upon his retirement, he was honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to hold this grade.<ref name="WO-5" /> Barrow died in April 2008.<ref>Air National Guard Retired Fire Chiefs.

Accessed on 27 January 2009.</ref> Since Barrow's retirement, the Air Force warrant officer ranks, while still authorized by law, are not used.

===Enlisted airmen===
[[File:Pararescue.training exercise.jpg|right|thumb|Pararescuemen and a simulated "survivor" watch as an HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter comes in for a landing.]]
{{Main|United States Air Force enlisted rank insignia}}

Enlisted members of the USAF have pay grades from E-1 (entry level) to E-9 (senior enlisted).  While all USAF military personnel are referred to as ''Airmen'', the term also refers to the [[pay grade]]s of E-1 through E-4, which are below the level of [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs).  Above the pay grade of E-4 (i.e., pay grades E-5 through E-9) all ranks fall into the category of NCO and are further subdivided into '''NCOs''' (pay grades E-5 and E-6) and '''Senior NCOs''' (pay grades E-7 through E-9); the term '''Junior NCO''' is sometimes used to refer to staff sergeants and technical sergeants (pay grades E-5 and E-6).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/insignias/enlisted.html |title=Department of Defense Enlisted Rank Insignias |publisher=Defenselink.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

The USAF is the only of the five branches of the United States military where NCO status is not achieved until an airman reaches the pay grade of E-5.  In all other branches, NCO status is generally achieved at the pay grade of E-4 (e.g., a [[Corporal]] in the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[Petty Officer Third Class]] in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]). However, E-4s in the Army with the rank of [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] are not considered NCOs.  The Air Force mirrored the Army from 1976 to 1991 with an E-4 being either a Senior Airman wearing three stripes without a star or a Sergeant (referred to as "Buck Sergeant"), which was noted by the presence of the central star and considered an NCO.  Despite not being an NCO, a Senior Airman who has completed [[Airman Leadership School]] can be a supervisor.

===Uniforms===
{{Main|Uniforms of the United States Air Force}}

USAF personnel wear uniforms that are distinct from those of the other branches of the United States armed forces. The first USAF dress uniform, in 1947, was dubbed and patented "[[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] Blue" after "Uxbridge 1683 Blue", developed at the former ''Bachman-Uxbridge Worsted Company''.<ref name = "uniforms">{{cite web |title= Getting the Blues, by Tech. Sgt. Pat McKenna|publisher= Air Force Link |url= http://www.af.mil/news/airman/1296/duds.htm|accessdate= 24 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070202154555/http://www.af.mil/news/airman/1296/duds.htm |archivedate = February 2, 2007}}</ref> The current Service Dress Uniform, which was adopted in 1993 and standardized in 1995, consists of a three-button, pocketless coat, similar to that of a men's "sport jacket" (with silver "U.S." pins on the lapels), matching trousers, and either a service cap or flight cap, all in Shade 1620, "Air Force Blue" (a darker purplish-blue). This is worn with a light blue shirt (Shade 1550) and Shade 1620 herringbone patterned necktie. Enlisted members wear sleeve insignia on both the jacket and shirt, while officers wear metal rank insignia pinned onto the coat, and Air Force Blue slide-on epaulet loops on the shirt. USAF personnel assigned to Base Honor Guard duties wear, for certain occasions, a modified version of the standard service dress uniform, but with silver trim on the sleeves and trousers, with the addition of a ceremonial belt (if necessary), wheel cap with silver trim and Hap Arnold Device, and a silver aiguillette placed on the left shoulder seam and all devices and accoutrement.

The current utility uniform is called the [[Airman Battle Uniform]] (ABU). The previous utility uniform called the [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDU) is still authorized for wear but is becoming less common. The ABU is scheduled to completely replace the BDU by October 1, 2011 (Fiscal Year 2012).

===Awards and badges===
{{Main|Awards and decorations of the United States Air Force|Badges of the United States Air Force}}

In addition to basic uniform clothing, [[Badges of the United States Air Force|various badges]] are used by the USAF to indicate a job assignment or qualification-level for a given assignment. Badges can also be used as merit-based or service-based [[Awards and decorations of the United States Air Force|awards]]. Over time, [[Obsolete badges of the United States military|various badges]] have been discontinued and are no longer distributed. Authorized badges include the Shields of USAF Fire Protection, and Security Forces, and the Missile badge, which is given after working on a missile system for over a year.

===Training===
{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}
All non-prior service enlisted Airmen must undergo basic military training (BMT), which takes place at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]].  All officers are commissioned through the [[United States Air Force Academy]], [[Air Force Officer Training School]], [[Academy of Military Science]], or the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]] program. However, if one is an officer through the healthcare, legal, or religious sectors, he or she will go through the Commissioned Officer Training program.

====Air Force Fitness Test====
[[Image:USAF PT Uniform.jpg|thumb|right|USAF members training at Lackland AFB]]
{{Main|United States Air Force Fitness Test}}

The US Air Force Fitness Test (AFFT) is designed to test the abdominal cicumference, muscular strength/endurance and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of airmen in the USAF. As part of the ''Fit to Fight'' program, the USAF adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment; the new fitness program was put into effect on June 1, 2010, and replaced the annual ergo-cycle test which the USAF had used for several years. In the AFFT, Airmen are given a score based on performance consisting of four components: waist circumference, the sit-up, the push-up, and a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|sing=on}} run. Airmen can potentially earn a score of 100, with the run counting as 60%, waist circumference as 20%, and both strength test counting as 10% each.  A passing score is 75 points.  Effective July 1, 2010, the AFFT will be administered by the base Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC), and will be required twice a year.  Personnel may test once a year if he or she earns a score above a 90%.  Additionally, only meeting the minimum standards on each one of these test will not get you a passing score of 75%.

==Aircraft inventory==
{{Main|List of active United States military aircraft}}

The US Air Force has over 5,778 aircraft commissioned as of 2004.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Until 1962, the Army and Air Force maintained one system of aircraft naming, while the U.S. Navy maintained a separate system. In 1962, these were unified into a single system heavily reflecting the Army/Air Force method. For more complete information on the workings of this system, refer to [[United States Department of Defense aerospace vehicle designation]].  The various aircraft of the Air Force include:

===A - Ground attack===
[[File:A10Thunderbolt2 990422-F-7910D-517.jpg|thumb|right|[[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] [[ground attack aircraft]].]]

The ground-attack aircraft of the USAF are designed to attack targets on the ground and are often deployed as close air support for, and in proximity to, U.S. ground forces. The proximity to friendly forces require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible with bomber aircraft listed below. They are typically deployed as close air support to ground forces, their role is tactical rather than strategic, operating at the front of the battle rather than against targets deeper in the enemy's rear.

* [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10A/C Thunderbolt II]]
* [[AC-130|AC-130H/U Spectre/Spooky II]]

===B - Bombers===
[[File:B-2 Spirit original.jpg|thumb|right|[[B-2 Spirit]] [[stealth aircraft|stealth]] [[strategic bomber]].]]
[[File:B1s.jpg|thumb|right|[[B-1 Lancer]] [[supersonic]] strategic bomber.]]

In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations. The US is the only country, besides Russia, that operates strategic bombers.

The [[B-52 Stratofortress]] airframe is over 50 years old, and are scheduled to remain in service for another 30 years, which would keep the airframe in service for nearly 90 years, an unprecedented length of service for any aircraft. Plans for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects, and political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to remain paper-bound for the foreseeable future.

===C - Cargo transport===
[[Image:C17virginia.jpg|thumb|[[C-17 Globemaster III]], the USAF's newest and most versatile [[transport plane]].]]
[[File:Usaf.c5.galaxy.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[C-5 Galaxy]] heavy [[airlift]].]]
[[File:CV-22 Formation.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey|CV-22 Osprey]] [[tiltrotor]] aircraft.]]

The Air Force can provide rapid global mobility, which lies at the heart of U.S. strategy in this environment<U+2014>without the capability to project forces, there is no conventional deterrent. As U.S. forces stationed overseas continue to decline, global interests remain, making the unique mobility capabilities of the USAF even more in demand. Air mobility is a national asset of growing importance for responding to emergencies and protecting American interests around the globe.

Cargo and transport aircraft are typically used to deliver troops, weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the world, usually outside of the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. The workhorses of the USAF [[Air Mobility Command]] are the [[C-130 Hercules]], [[C-17 Globemaster III]], and [[C-5 Galaxy]]. These aircraft are largely defined in terms of their range capability as strategic airlift (C-5), strategic/tactical (C-17), and tactical (C-130) airlift to reflect the needs of the land forces they most often support.   The CV-22 is used by the Air Force for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It conducts long-range, special operations missions, and is equipped with extra fuel tanks and terrain-following radar.

===E - Special electronic missions===
[[Image:Usaf.e3sentry.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[E-3 Sentry]] [[airborne warning and control system]] ]]

The purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent an advantage in the EMS and ensure friendly, unimpeded access to the EM spectrum portion of the information environment. Electronic warfare aircraft are used to keep airspaces friendly, and send critical information to anyone who needs it. They are often called "The Eye in the Sky."

===F - Fighters===
[[File:Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor JSOH.jpg|thumb|right|[[F-22 Raptor]] stealth [[air superiority fighter]] ]]
[[File:F-15E - Controlling The Sky.JPG|thumb|right|[[F-15E Strike Eagle]] [[strike fighter]] ]]

The fighter aircraft of the USAF are small, fast, and maneuverable military aircraft primarily used for air-to-air combat. Many of these fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are dual-roled as fighter-bombers (e.g., the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]); the term "fighter" is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft. Other missions include interception of bombers and other fighters, reconnaissance, and patrol. Out of the 5,778 manned aircraft in service, 2,402 are fighters, and 1,245 of those are variants of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

From 2006 to 2025, the USAF plans to reduce its inventory of tactical aircraft by 28%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/htext/d07415.html |title=GAO: April 2007: Tactical Aircraft: DOD Needs a Joint and Integrated Investment Strategy |publisher=Gao.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

===H - Search and rescue===

These craft are used for [[search and rescue]] and [[combat search and rescue]] on land or sea.

* [[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130P/N Hercules]]
* [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G/MH-60G Pave Hawk]]

===K - Tanker===
[[File:KC-10 Extender (2151957820).jpg|thumb|right|[[KC-10 Extender]] tri-jet [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air tanker]].]]

The USAF's aerial refueling aircraft are derivatives of civilian jets. Usually, the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task, although refueling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the "probe and drogue" system is to be used. There is no known regular civilian in-flight refueling activity. In large-scale operations (and even daily air operations), air-to-air refueling is extensively used; fighters, bombers, and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the lesser-known "tanker" aircraft. This makes these aircraft an essential part of the Air Force's global mobility and the U.S. force projection.

* [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10A Extender]]
* [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135E/R/T Stratotanker]]

===M - Multi-mission===
Specialized multi-mission aircraft provide support for global special operations missions. These aircraft conduct infiltration, exfiltration, resupply, and refueling for SOF teams from improvised or otherwise short runways.

* [[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130E/H/P/W Combat Talon I/Combat Talon II/Combat Shadow/Combat Spear]]

====Q - Multi-mission RPAs (Remote Piloted Aircraft)====
[[File:First MQ-9 Reaper at Creech AFB 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[MQ-9]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]].]]

Initial generations of RPAs were primarily surveillance aircraft, but some were fitted with weaponry (such as the MQ-1 Predator, which used AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles). An armed RPA is known as an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV).

* [[MQ-1 Predator]]
* [[MQ-9 Reaper]]

===O - Observation===
These aircraft are modified to observe (through visual or other means) and report tactical information concerning composition and disposition of forces.
* [[OC-135B Open Skies]]

===R - Reconnaissance===
[[File:Globalhawk.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[RQ-4 Global Hawk]] unmanned aerial vehicle [[reconnaissance aircraft]].]]
[[File:Usaf.u2.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lockheed U-2]] [[spy plane]].]]

The reconnaissance aircraft of the USAF are used for monitoring enemy activity, originally carrying no armament. Several unmanned remotely-controlled reconnaissance aircraft (RPAs) have been developed and deployed. Recently, the RPAs have been seen to offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that can be used without risk to aircrews.

''Note: Although the U-2 is designated as a 'utility' aircraft, it is indeed a reconnaissance platform.''

* [[RQ-11 Raven]]
* [[RQ-170 Sentinel]]
* [[Lockheed U-2|U-2R/S "Dragon Lady"]]

===T - Trainer===
The Air Force's trainer aircraft are used to train pilots, navigators, and other aircrew in their duties.

* [[Schempp-Hirth Duo Discus|TG-15A]]/[[Schempp-Hirth Discus-2|TG-15B]]
* [[Diamond T-52A]]

===U - Utility===
Utility aircraft are used basically for what they are needed for at the time. For example, a Huey may be used to transport personnel around a large base or launch site, while it can also be used for evacuation. These aircraft are all around use aircraft.

* [[Pilatus PC-12|U-28A]]
* [[UH-1N Twin Huey|UH-1N Iroquois]]
* [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|UV-18A/B Twin Otter]]

===V - VIP staff transport===
[[File:Air Force One over Mt. Rushmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[VC-25A]] ([[Air Force One]]).]]

These aircraft are used for the transportation of '''V'''ery '''I'''mportant '''P'''ersons. Notable people include the [[President of the United States|President]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], secretaries, government officials (e.g., senators and representatives), the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other key personnel.

==Culture==
The culture of the United States Air Force is primarily driven by pilots and so the pilots of various aircraft types have driven its priorities over the years.  At first there was a focus on bombers (driven originally by the [[Bomber mafia]]), followed by a focus on fighters ([[Fighter Mafia]] and following).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/01/0155/A015524.html |title=Air Force Culture and Conventional Strategic Airpower |publisher=Stormingmedia.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

In response to the [[2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert M. Gates]] accepted in June 2009 the resignations of [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Michael Wynne]] and the [[Chief of Staff of the Air Force]] General [[T. Michael Moseley]]. Moseley's successor, General [[Norton A. Schwartz]], was the first officer appointed to that position who did not have a background as a fighter or bomber pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/p/2008/jun/10/nation/na-schwartz10 |title=A different type of Air Force leader |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-30 | first1=Julian E. | last1=Barnes | first2=Peter | last2=Spiegel}}</ref> The Washington Post reported that General Schwartz has begun to dismantle the rigid class system of the USAF.<ref>{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/27/AR2010022703754_2.html |title=Combat Generation: Drone operators climb on winds of change in the Air Force |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

Dunlap, Jr.]] adds that Air Force culture includes an [[egalitarianism]] bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/SepOct07/dunlapengseptoct07.pdf |title=Understanding Airmen: A primer for soldiers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

===Slogans and creeds===
The United States Air Force has had numerous recruiting slogans including "No One Comes Close" and "Uno Ab Alto". For many years, the U.S. Air Force used "Aim High" as its recruiting slogan; more recently, they have used "Cross into the Blue", "We've been waiting for you" and "Do Something Amazing",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dosomethingamazing.com/ |title="Do Something Amazing" web site |publisher=Dosomethingamazing.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> "Above All",<ref>[http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2008/02/airforce_aboveall_080219w/ "Air Force rolls out new advertising campaign"], Airforcetimes.com, 2 March 2008.</ref> and the newest one, as of October 7, 2010, considered a [[call and response]],  "Aim high" followed with the response, "Fly-Fight-Win" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123225546/ |title=Aim High ... Fly-Fight-Win |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref>  Each wing, group, or squadron usually has its own slogan(s). Information and logos can usually be found on the wing, group, or squadron websites.<ref>[http://www.military-quotes.com/mottos/US-Air-Force.htm US Air Force Mottos]. Military-quotes.com. Retrieved 4 June 2006.</ref>

The Air Force Core Values are: "Integrity first", "Service before self", "Excellence in all we do".<ref>[http://www.dosomethingamazing.com/learn-about/our-mission/ Our Mission - Learn About The U.S. Air Force]. AirForce.com.</ref> [[Airman's Creed|The Airman's Creed]] is a statement introduced in the spring of 2007 to summarize the culture of the Air Force.

To help further knowledge of their mission and functions, the Air Force has also produced videos, such as "Setting the Conditions for Victory" and "How We Fight",<ref>[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123070350 "'Setting the Conditions for Victory' video premieres online"]. USAF, 3 October 2007</ref> to outline the Air Force role in the war on terrorism and how the service succeeds in its domains of air, space, and cyberspace. The Above All campaign continues to support the message of "air, space and cyberspace" dominance.
