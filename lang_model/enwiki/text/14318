'''Gilberto Aparecido da Silva''' (born [[October 7]], [[1976]] in [[Lagoa da Prata]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]]), commonly known as '''Gilberto Silva''' ({{IPA2|<U+0292><U+026A>wbet<U+0289><U+02D0> s<U+026A>wv<U+025C><U+02D0>}}), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He has played most of his club football for [[England|English]] club, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]].

Gilberto was raised in a poor family, and as a child he balanced playing football with various labour jobs.<ref name="shopsteward">"[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/09/02/sfnmot02.xml&page=2 Life is sweet for Brazil's shop steward]", Telegraph Sport, [[2 September]] [[2006]].

He became a star player for Atl<U+00E9>tico, playing for three years in the [[Brazilian football league system|Brazilian]] [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie A]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
As a child Gilberto lived in the city of Lagoa da Prata with his father (a blacksmith), his mother (a housewife) and three sisters.<ref name="shopsteward"/> His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the district of Usina Luciania. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as "[a time when] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, and we never had any contact with drugs or violence".<ref name="silvalining2">"[http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050820/ai_n14917082/pg_2 Highbury's Silva Lining Pg2]", The London Independent, [[20 August]] [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref>
In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining Am<U+00E9>rica Mineiro as a youth player. It was during these years at Am<U+00E9>rica Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a [[Defender (football)#Centre back|central defender]]. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught furniture making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto's father retired leaving the fifteen year old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother's ill-health.<ref name="weightingold">"[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/05/15/sfnars15.xml&sSheet=/sport/2005/05/15/ixfooty.html Silva worth his weight in gold]", Telegraph Sport, [[May 15]] [[2005]].

Because of the low wage at Am<U+00E9>rica Mineiro, he was forced to quit football to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would be the end of his childhood dream.<ref name="earnstripes">"[http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4515643-103,00.html New Gunner Gilberto is quick to earn his stripes]", The Guardian, [[September 5]] [[2002]].

Retrieved on [[October 12]] [[2006]].</ref> After three years of working in a factory, the 18 year old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last for long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.

===Early career===
In 1997, Gilberto's friends tried to convince him to give football another try; something which led to him re-signing for Am<U+00E9>rica Mineiro on [[June 1]] [[1997]], this time as a full-time professional. Aged 21, Gilberto played as a central defender for the first team. During his first season for Am<U+00E9>rica Mineiro he was regarded as a key player by the club, despite being criticised by some fans for inconsistency.<ref name="cheese" /> He helped them win the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie B|S<U+00E9>rie B]] division, and consequently gain promotion to [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie A|S<U+00E9>rie A]].

During Gilberto's third season at Am<U+00E9>rica Mineiro (the club's second season in S<U+00E9>rie A) he played 20 games and scored one goal, helping the club to finish runners up in the league. In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro. In his first season for the club, he fractured his right [[tibia]] and, as a result, missed a number of games.<ref name="ownworldcup" /> In his second season, he was moved by the manager [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became a revelation in Brazilian club football.<ref name="sportsillustrated">"[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/players/brazil/  Brazil player profiles]", CNNSI.com, retrieved on [[October 9]] [[2006]].</ref>

In October 2001, his good performances from that year earned Gilberto a call-up to the Brazilian national team ("''A Sele<U+00E7><U+00E3>o''") by [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] for the 2002 World Cup qualification games.<ref name="bbc2002wc">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/brazil/squad/newsid_1971000/1971765.stm  Gilberto Silva 2002 World Cup Profile]", BBC Sport, [[May 8]] [[2002]].

On [[November 7]], he made his debut in the starting line-up of the national team against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]]. His international career continued to flourish in early 2002: he scored twice against Bolivia and once against Iceland. In 2002, he was a surprise inclusion in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup squads#Brazil|Brazil squad]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He was expected to play a bit part in the tournament. However, defensive midfielder and Brazilian team captain [[Emerson Ferreira da Rosa|Emerson]] was injured in training just before the first World Cup game.<ref>Dominic Fifield, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2002/countries/story/0,11936,726880,00.html High jinks rule Brazil captain out of cup], Guardian Unlimited, [[June 3]] [[2002]].

===Senior career===
Gilberto's performance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup caught the attention of many coaches. Gilberto expressed a desire to move to England, saying, "It would be fantastic to play against the likes of [[David Beckham]] again."<ref name="allthingsfootie">"[http://www.allthingsfootie.co.uk/archives/2002_07_01_index.php All Things Footie Archive]", All Things Footie, [[25 July]] [[2002]]. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> As a result, [[Aston Villa]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] led the chase to sign him. In August, while still under contract to Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season tour of [[Austria]]; while he had not yet signed for Arsenal the deal looked set to go ahead. However, complications arose when a transfer embargo was placed on Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro due to unpaid wages to some players at the club, including Gilberto.<ref name="espnprofile">"[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=20131&cc=5739 ESPNsoccernet: Gilberto Silva Profile]", ESPNsoccernet.

Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> Despite the complications, Gilberto ended a summer of speculation and joined Arsenal on [[August 7]] [[2002]] for a fee of <U+00A3>4.5 million. Upon signing Gilberto, Arsenal manager [[Arsen<U+00E9> Wenger]] said, "What I like was the fact that he kept things simple. He can play all across the midfield but the holding role just in front of the defence is what he does best."<ref name="espnprofile" />

[[Image:Gilberto Silva.png|thumb|120px|Gilberto defending a corner for Arsenal at Highbury in April of 2006.]]

When Gilberto moved to England and began training with Arsenal, he bought a house in [[St Albans]], South [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name="ofutebol">"[http://www.ofutebol.com/view.asp?ArticleId=6 Ofutebol: Gilberto Interview]", Futebol: The Brazilian Way Of Life, [[2005]].

Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On [[August 11]] [[2002]] he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the second half of the [[FA Community Shield]] game in which he scored the winning goal. As the [[FA Premier League 2002-03|2002-03 Premiership season]] began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from compatriot [[Eduardo C<U+00E9>sar Gaspar|Edu]]. After two substitute appearances Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on [[August 27]], helping Arsenal to a 5-2 win against [[West Bromwich Albion]]. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the [[UEFA Champions League]], scoring after 20.07 seconds against [[PSV Eindhoven]] on [[September 25]] [[2002]].<ref name="uefaprofile">"[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/Players/Player=64769/index.html uefa.com - Players - Gilberto Silva]", uefa.com, [[2 September]] [[2006]]. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> However, his legal problems continued, since his transfer to England still was not fully resolved. As a result Gilberto instructed his lawyers to start legal proceedings against Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002.<ref name="gilbertosues">"[http://ussoccerplayers.com/latest_soccer_news/329826.html Gilberto sues Atletico Mineiro]", United States National Soccer Players Association. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro were alleged to have only paid Gilberto 50% of his fee for moving to Arsenal. For the second half of the 2002-03 season, he remained a regular starter in the Arsenal side. Even though he suffered a lapse in form towards the end of the season, he won an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal, playing in the final at the [[Millennium Stadium]] as Arsenal beat [[Southampton FC|Southampton]] 1-0.

[[2003-04 in English football|2003-04]] was an even better season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the [[FA Premier League]] title whilst going the entire season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premiership games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal's 3-1 FA Community Shield win over [[Manchester United]] at the Millennium Stadium. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at Bolton on [[September 27]] [[2004]], a scan revealed he had fractured his back.

During the whole [[FA Premier League 2004-05|2004-05 season]], Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team;<ref name="wengerhails">"[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2005/04/01/story196213.html Wenger hails Gunner Gilberto's contribution]", BreakingNews.ie, [[1 April]] [[2005]].

During the summer which followed, on [[June 22]] [[2005]], Gilberto played in Brazil's 1-1 draw against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], in his only game of the [[Confederations Cup 2005|2005 Confederations Cup]]. His absence as a first team regular could be explained by his lack of games, and thus match fitness, for Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament. Gilberto's appearance in the tournament gained him a winners medal, as Brazil went on to win the competition.

In June 2005, football agent [[Jacques Lichtenstein]] took Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro to court over Gilberto's transfer in 2002. Lichtenstein's lawyer argued that he and his informal partner, [[Ronny Rosenthal]], never received an allegedly agreed 10% commission from Gilberto's <U+00A3>4.5 million transfer to Arsenal from Atl<U+00E9>tico Mineiro in July 2002.<ref name="casecitation">"[http://www.eldial.com/suplementos/deportivo/tcc.asp?id=293&base=99&camara=Jurisprudencia Jacques Lichtenstein vs. Clube Atletico Mineiro, Neutral Citation Number: 2005 EWHC 1300 (QB).

Retrieved [[October 9]] [[2006]].</ref> Gilberto did not take Juninho's advice, and has continued his international career.

Following the departure of defender [[Sol Campbell]] and retirement of striker [[Dennis Bergkamp]] in the summer of 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal's vice-captain for the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07 season]].<ref name="threekings"/> He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch [[DSB Stadion]] in a pre-season friendly. He then went on to score Arsenal's first ever goal in a competitive match at the [[Emirates Stadium]], in a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa. The first half of the season turned out to be his most illustrious in front of goal. From August to December, Gilberto scored eight goals for Arsenal, and garnered praise for his performances as stand-in captain while [[Thierry Henry]] was injured.<ref name="captaincypraise">"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-2483912,00.html Stand-in captain shoulders burden]", Times Online, [[December 03]] [[2006]].

Gilberto has indicated that after his current contract finishes at Arsenal he may return to Brazil to play club football.<ref name="gilbertoboost"/> He has also stated, "I would like to live in a small farm and ride a horse and have all of my family next to me."<ref name="comforts">"[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/06/27/269628-gilberto-silva-earned-his-comforts-in-life Gilberto Silva earned his comforts in life]", newsvine.com, [[27 June]] [[2006]]. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref><!-- NOTE: If you are new to Wikipedia, then think before you add information here. Is it really notable? -->

==Style of play==
Gilberto is often called "the invisible wall" (or "volante") in Brazil.<ref name="ownworldcup"/> His play often goes unnoticed as he positions himself between the two centre backs and the rest of midfield, breaking up opposition attacks before they gather momentum. In this role, he is a part of the defensive unit for both club and country.<ref name="guidetocoaching">Jacob Daniel, ''The Complete Guide to Coaching Soccer Systems and Tactics'', pg 106, (Reedswain Inc., [[1 March]], [[2004]]).</ref> As Arsenal and Brazil are both attack minded teams, he offers cover for attacking [[Defender (football)#Wingback|wing-backs]] and other midfielders who have a poor record of dropping back to help the defence. When playing, Gilberto occasionally drops into the centre of defence to cover the central defenders, usually [[Lucimar Ferreira da Silva|L<U+00FA>cio]] for Brazil and [[Kolo Tour<U+00E9>]] for Arsenal, who are both known for their attacking runs forward with the ball. Gilberto's style of defending is unlike that of normal midfield enforcers. Whereas some midfielders, (e.g. [[Robbie Savage]] and [[Roy Keane]]) are very strong in the challenge, Gilberto is more passive when he defends. Rather than tackle a player, he is more likely to shadow him, thus pushing him back.<ref name="bragame">"[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=341162&root=world&cc=5739 ESPN: On the Brazilian game]", ESPNsoccernet, [[30 August]] [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> As a result, he has an unusually clean record for a defensive midfielder: he has twice gone 45 games or more without receiving a single [[Misconduct (football)|booking]] during his Arsenal career.<ref name="soccerbase">"[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=19036 Gilberto Silva Statistics]", www.soccerbase.com - The Internet Soccer Database. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> This mentality earns him both praise and criticism.

Gilberto is good at helping to defend against oppponents who play a [[Long ball|long-ball]] game because he often [[Man marking|man marks]] the opposition's attacking [[Striker|target-man]]. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, something to which long-ball teams are not suited.<ref name="coachingtactics">Phil Wymer, ''Coaching Soccer Tactics'', pg 94, (Soccertactics.com, [[22 November]], [[2005]]).</ref>

Despite Gilberto's high pass completion rate,<ref name="passing">"[http://www.arsenal-mania.com/news/2518226/Some-interesting-Opta-stats.html Some interesting Opta stats]", Arsenal-Mania.com. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> his passing has been described as erratic in the past.<ref name="erratic">"[http://www.arsenali.co.uk/2006/10/gilberto-key-to-arsenal-renaissance.html Gilberto the key to the Arsenal renaissance]", Arsenali.co.uk, [[October 26]] [[2006]]. Retrieved on [[October 26]] [[2006]].</ref> A possible explanation for this, is Gilberto's short passing range. He is more likely to offload the ball frequently to midfield players close around him (such as [[Patrick Vieira]] or [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]]), thus easily gaining a high pass completion rate. These short-range passes often go unnoticed, while relatively infrequent long-range incomplete passes often receive negative attention, although not enough to significantly lower his overall pass completion rate.

According to ProZone (a data analysis system used by football managers) figures cited by ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in January 2007, Gilberto is, together with [[Paul Scholes]] of Manchester United and [[Frank Lampard]] of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], one of the few midfielders in England to attain "the elite Champions League level" of performance.<ref name="prozone">{{cite news| url=http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_1821621,00.html |title=Chelski players turn on Ballack |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2007-01-07 |publisher=Football365.com }}</ref>

Gilberto is a patron of [[The Street League (UK)|The Street League]], a UK based charity which organises football matches for homeless people, refugees and asylum-seekers. In June 2003, Gilberto travelled to [[Brazil]] on tour with 17 Street League players.<ref name="charitywork">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-692313,00.html Interviews: Gilberto Charity Work]", Times Online.

[[Image:Gilberto_playing_mandolin.png|thumb|left|150px|Gilberto plays a tune on a [[mandolin]].]]Gilberto is a keen musician. In his spare time he plays the [[mandolin]] and the guitar. When he first moved to England he took up mandolin lessons and played publicly at his local pub in St Albans. He later started learning the guitar instead.<ref name="guitar">[http://sify.com/sports/football/fullstory.php?id=14238621 Brazil's stars wow with their musical talent]", Sify Sports. Retrieved on [[25 September]] [[2006]].</ref> Like many Brazilian footballers he plays samba music with his teammates in the Sele<U+00E7><U+00E3>o (the Brazilian national team) when they are relaxing in between international matches.

Gilberto has a [[Giant Anteater]] named after him at [[London Zoo]]. Gilberto is an adoptee of the animal, which he received from a London Zoo competition winner. The footballer described the South American animal as "my slightly more hairy brother!"<ref name="anteater">"[http://www.zsl.org/london-zoo/news/gilberto-meet-gilberto,126,NS.html Gilberto meet - Gilberto!]", ZSL - London Zoo - News, [[5 February]] [[2004]].
