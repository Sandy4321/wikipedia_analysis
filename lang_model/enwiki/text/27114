{{NBA Labour Relations}}
The '''2011 NBA lockout''' was the fourth [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] in the [[NBA lockout|history]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The owners began the work stoppage upon expiration of the 2005 [[NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA). The 161-day lockout began on July 1, 2011 and ended on December 8, 2011. It delayed the start of the {{nbay|2011|app=regular season}} from November 1 to December 25, and it reduced the regular season from 82 to 66 games. The previous [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA lockout|lockout in 1998<U+2013>99]] had shortened the season to 50 games. During the lockout, teams could not [[Trade (sports)|trade]], sign or contact players, and players could not access NBA team facilities, trainers or staffs.

Negotiations between the owners, led by commissioner [[David Stern]], and the players, led by director [[Billy Hunter (American football)|Billy Hunter]] and president [[Derek Fisher]] of the labor union [[National Basketball Players Association]] (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing both sides were the division of [[revenue]] and the structure of the [[salary cap]] and [[Luxury tax (sports)|luxury tax]]. Owners proposed to reduce the players<U+2019> share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft salary cap structure intact.

As both sides failed to reach an agreement, the NBA canceled the preseason and all games through December. On November 14, the players dissolved the union, allowing them to file anti-trust lawsuits against the league. On November 26, both sides reached a tentative agreement to end the lockout. The new CBA calls for a revenue split of 49-to-51.2% and a flexible salary cap structure with harsher luxury tax. After the tentative deal was reached, owners allowed players to have voluntary workouts at team sites starting December 1. After the deal was ratified on December 8, [[training camp]]s, trades and [[free agency]] began the next day. During the lockout, some players signed contracts to play in other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, with most of them having the option to return upon the lockout's conclusion. The lockout also had a negative impact on the economy due largely to NBA cities losing revenue generated by games as well as television networks losing ratings and advertisement revenue.

==Background==
[[File:David Stern.jpg|thumb|160px|upright|right|alt=A man in his 50s with white hair speaks into a microphone. He wears a gray suit, red tie, and glasses.|This was the fourth lockout in [[David Stern]]'s tenure as NBA commissioner.]]
After the [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA lockout|previous lockout]], which shortened the {{nbay|1998|app=season}} from 82 to 50 games, a six-year deal between the owners, led by commissioner [[David Stern]], and the players, led by director [[Billy Hunter (American football)|Billy Hunter]] and president [[Patrick Ewing]] of the labor union [[National Basketball Players Association]] (NBPA), was reached. As the CBA was set to expire on June 30, 2005, the two sides began to negotiate in early 2005. There were several issues obstructing the new agreement, which included adding an [[Eligibility for the NBA Draft|age limit for rookies]], toughening the existing drug-testing program and limiting the length of long-term contracts. However, negotiations went smoothly and the two sides were able to reach a deal in June 2005, avoiding the lockout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/CBA_050730.html|title=NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement Ratified and Signed|date=July 30, 2005|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101202233937/http://www.nba.com/news/CBA_050730.html |archivedate=July 30, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=N.B.A. and Union Can't Agree on Exactly What's at Issue |date=June 16, 2005 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/16/sports/basketball/16hunter.html |accessdate=August 4, 2011 }}</ref> That deal guaranteed players 57&nbsp;percent of basketball-related income (BRI) and lasted for six years, until June 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |last=Broussard |first=Chris |title=Sources: Meeting before deadline off |date=October 7, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7072853/meeting-nba-owners-union-scuttled-50-50-split-demand-sources-say |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62H6T0uLv |archivedate=October 8, 2011 }}</ref> A year after signing the deal, eight owners signed a petition requesting Stern address the disparity between [[small-market]] and large-market teams. They wrote that "the hard truth is that our current economic system works only for larger-market teams and a few teams that have extraordinary success ...The rest of us are looking at significant and unacceptable annual financial losses."<ref>{{cite news |last=Windhorst |first=Brian |title=How "small market" owners took control |date=October 25, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/32834/how-small-market-owners-took-control |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62if4YMOX |archivedate=October 26, 2011}}</ref>

[[Derek Fisher]] succeeded Ewing as NBPA president in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |title=Derek Fisher, Champion Point Guard and Face of the Players Union |date=October 18, 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=B18 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/sports/basketball/derek-fisher-champion-point-guard-and-face-of-the-players-union.html?_r=1&sq=derek%20fisher&st=cse&scp=1&pagewanted=all |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62Y0W7KpF |archivedate=October 19, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> In early 2011, negotiations on a new CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard [[NBA salary cap|salary cap]] (at $45 million per team) as opposed to a soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout.<ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Beck |title=Progress of Negotiations Is Hidden in Semantics |date=February 19, 2011 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/sports/basketball/20stern.html |accessdate=August 4, 2011 }}</ref> In May 2011, the NBPA filed a complaint with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.<ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Beck |title=Turning to Labor Board, N.B.A. Union Fires First |date=May 24, 2011 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/sports/basketball/players-accuse-nba-of-failing-to-bargain-in-good-faith.html |accessdate=August 4, 2011 }}</ref>

With time winding down, negotiations continued in May and June. On the salary cap, the owners, in their newest proposal, call for a system called the "flex cap" that limits payroll at $62 million but penalizes teams if the teams payroll exceeds the league's average payroll of that season.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Washburn |title=NBA owners now offering players <U+2018>flex cap<U+2019> |date=June 22, 2011 |work=Boston Globe |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-22/sports/29690762_1_salary-cap-hard-cap-nba-owners |accessdate=August 4, 2011 }}</ref> The union argued that it is still a hard cap because the ceiling would kick in eventually.<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA players reject 'flex cap' proposal |date=June 21, 2011 |work=CBC.ca |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/story/2011/06/21/sp-nba-labour.html |accessdate=August 4, 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110623064222/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/story/2011/06/21/sp-nba-labour.html| archivedate= June 23, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> On salary reduction, players offered to cut $500 million over the next five years (their share of BRI would be reduced from 57 to 54.3 percent).

As a last-ditch effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a resolution on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.<ref name="lockoutbegin">{{cite news|last=Cacciola|first=Scott|title=NBA Owners Lock Out Players|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304584004576417752764625330.html|work=Sports Journalism|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=July 8, 2011|date=July 1, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110701015038/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304584004576417752764625330.html| archivedate= July 1, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Lockout==
===Initial months===
The lockout was officially started by the owners on July 1, 2011, during which, teams could not [[Trade (sports)|trade]], sign or contact players, and players could not access NBA team facilities, trainers or staffs. Negotiations resumed at an August 1 bargaining session, but it fell apart after three hours.<ref name=lockout_begins>{{cite news |title=David Stern, Derek Fisher join talks |date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6824510/david-stern-derek-fisher-join-nba-labor-talks-first-time |accessdate=August 4, 2011 }}</ref> On August 2, 2011, the NBA filed two unfair labor practice claims against the NBPA, one at the NLRB and another at a [[List of United States district and territorial courts|federal district court]] in New York. The league accused the players of being uncooperative in negotiations by threatening to dissolve their union and file antitrust lawsuits. Hunter, in a statement released by the union, called the lawsuits "without merit" and that the union would seek to dismiss it in court.<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA files federal lawsuit against players |date=August 3, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6826716/nba-takes-legal-action-locked-players |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}</ref> On August 4, Hunter said that he thought the entire {{nbay|2011|app=season}} would likely be canceled.<ref>{{cite news |title=Billy Hunter doubts entire '11<U+2013>12 season |date=August 4, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6832574/billy-hunter-expects-entire-nba-season-canceled |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Derek Fisher.jpg|thumb|160px |right|[[Derek Fisher]] was the [[National Basketball Players Association|players union]] president during the lockout.]]
The NBPA and the owners returned to negotiate again on August 31 with a sense of urgency. No specifics were disclosed although both sides hoped to meet again soon. "Everyone loses if we don't reach an agreement, that's something that I think has always been understood," said union president [[Derek Fisher]]. "I will say we are not apart in terms of an agreed urgency on getting a deal done," said NBA deputy commissioner [[Adam Silver]].<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA owners, union meet for 6 hours |date=September 1, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6914421/nba-lockout-nbpa-owners-meet-six-hours-manhattan |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

The union and owners met again on September 13 but the negotiation soon collapsed. The salary cap structure remained the main source of disagreement. Owners wanted to create a hard cap for team payroll. The union wanted to keep the current structure intact, referring to it as a "blood issue". Players were willing to cut salary only if owners agree to compromise on the salary cap. But owners were unwilling to concede, saying that there must be a system in place that allows all teams to compete.<ref>{{cite news |title=No progress made after latest labor talk |date=September 13, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6965103/nba-players-union-impasse-time-start-season-now-doubt |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref> Five of the [[sports agent]]s<U+2014>[[Arn Tellem]], [[Bill Duffy (basketball)|Bill Duffy]], [[Mark Bartelstein]], [[Jeff Schwartz]] and [[Dan Fegan]]<U+2014>who represent one-third of NBA players spoke with each other about [[decertification|decertifying]] the union. They believed owners have most of the leverage in negotiation and viewed decertification as a way for players to take control. Hunter said however that players have not considered decertification at this point.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sources: Agents want union to decertify |date=September 14, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6967636/nba-player-agents-angling-get-players-union-decertify |accessdate=September 14, 2011 |first=Chris |last=Broussard |coauthor=Abbott, Henry}}</ref>

On September 15, Fisher sent an email to 400-plus players asking for unity. In the email, he said that recent meetings were "effective". He suggested that the failure of having a deal was not due to disagreement between players and owners, but due to disagreement among owners. Fisher also used the opportunity to counter agents' suggestion of disbanding the union, saying that they were not making "a drastic move that leaves players without a union". According to sources, there was indeed disagreement among the owners. Some thought players' proposal of taking 52% of BRI was fair, and were willing to compromise on things like tying players' future earnings to NBA's future revenue growth and maintaining current salary level. [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cavaliers]]' [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]] and [[Phoenix Suns|Suns']] [[Robert Sarver]] were among the hardliners who oppose the deal while [[New York Knicks|Knicks']] [[James L. Dolan|James Dolan]] and the Lakers' [[Jerry Buss]] were among the group in favor of it.<ref>{{cite news |title=Derek Fisher: Rift among owners |date=September 15, 2011 |work=ESPN LA.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/6973675/nba-lockout-derek-fisher-los-angeles-lakers-emails-players-says-owners-rift |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |first=Dave |last=McMenamin}}</ref> Stern denied that there was a rift among owners the following day, saying, "I don't know what the basis of Derek's belief is."<ref>{{cite news |title=Players, then owners declare unity |date=September 16, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/6975352/nba-lockout-players-owners-declare-unity-separate-meetings |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |first=Dave |last=McMenamin |coauthor=MacMahon, Tim }}</ref>

===Cancellations===
On September 23, 2011, the NBA canceled training camp, which was to begin October 3, and the first week of preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15.<ref name=camp_canceled>[http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7008269/nba-postpones-camps-cancels-43-preseason-games NBA postpones camps indefinitely].

Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to [[ESPN]] that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Stern: Season hangs in balance |date=September 28, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7031637/nba-lockout-owners-players-meet-friday-possibly-weekend |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |first=Marc |last=Stein }}</ref> Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Stern's scary talk |date=September 28, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/32128/david-sterns-scary-talk |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |first=Henry |last=Abbott }}</ref> The meeting on September 30 was tense as [[Dwyane Wade]] reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA-union talks to continue Saturday |date=October 1, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7039251/nba-labor-talks-players-owners-return-talks-saturday-tense-moments |accessdate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref>

On October 4, the NBA canceled the remainder of the preseason. Stern said the league would lose $200 million by canceling the preseason, and warned that the first two weeks of the season would be in jeopardy if no deal is reached by October 10. The players proposed that they receive 53% of BRI, while the owners countered with 47%. The two sides then discussed a 50<U+2013>50 split of BRI, with the owners offering the players 49% of BRI with incentives that would raise the value to 51%. The players countered by asking for 51%, which would increase to 53 percent using those same incentives.

The large contracts signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions.

===Olympics===
Although the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic men's basketball tournament]] was then more than a year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.<ref name="Olympic fallout">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/Lockout-110714/nba-lockout-how-national-teams-affected-2012-games |title=London Olympics facing lockout |first=Chris |last=Sheridan |work=ESPN.com |date=July 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110717231838/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/Lockout-110714/nba-lockout-how-national-teams-affected-2012-games| archivedate= July 17, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

These costs are surprisingly high<U+2014>one [[sports agent|agent]] who represents an unnamed NBA player set to earn [[United States dollar|$]]10 million in the 2010<U+2013>11 season said the player had received a $400,000 quote to insure his contract for his national team's FIBA qualifier. The [[Spanish Basketball Federation]] said that insuring all the NBA players on [[Spain national basketball team|its national team]] for [[EuroBasket 2011]], which doubles as the [[FIBA Europe|European]] Olympic qualifiers, could cost as much as $5.67 million. [[Basketball Australia]] announced that [[Andrew Bogut]] would not be available for the [[2011 FIBA Oceania Championship]]; his agent indicated that the final deal-breaker was when insurers stated that they would not insure his remaining $39 million in NBA salary unless pre-existing elbow, wrist, and back injuries were excluded from the policy.<ref name="Olympic fallout"/>

A couple of weeks before the NBA season was originally scheduled to start, ''[[Reuters]]'' and ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' speculated on the prospect of increased interest in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) among NBA fans. The NHL had experienced steady growth since the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], and they again opened the [[2011<U+2013>12 NHL season|2011<U+2013>12 season]] in early October to record crowds.

The [[UTSA Roadrunners football|University of Texas at San Antonio]] (UTSA), in its inaugural [[college football]] [[2011 UTSA Roadrunners football team|season]], drew 40,000 fans to its games in September. The ''[[San Antonio Business Journal]]'' speculated on UTSA's opportunities to grow its fan base with the canceled NBA games in San Antonio.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baily |first=W.

===NBA cities===
Mayors from 14 NBA cities wrote an open letter to NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] and NBPA chief [[Billy Hunter (American football)|Billy Hunter]], requesting that they end the lockout based on "the perspective [of city] residents and the negative impact a canceled season might have on them, our cities, and our local economies."<ref name=gregory_11072011>{{cite news |last=Gregory |first=Sean |title=The NBA Lockout and the Economy: An Overstated Impact |date=November 7, 2011 |magazine=TIME |url=http://moneyland.time.com/2011/11/07/the-nba-lockout-and-the-economy-an-overstated-impact/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63DyxaDfm |archivedate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> ''[[TIME]]'' noted that arena workers would be affected by the cancellation of games. However, separate studies by [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] and [[Lake Forest College]] found no historic significant impact to the economies of cities with sports franchises affected by work stoppages. Explanations included consumer shifting of spending on sporting events to other forms of entertainment, reduced local government spending on crowd and traffic control, and higher productivity by the general workforce without the distraction of games.<ref name=gregory_11072011/>

===Other businesses===
It was estimated that a complete lockout had cost an upwards of $1 billion in lost television advertisement revenue. The lockout had dealt a sizable blow to the current licensed product market which was estimated at $2.7 billion, and had created a big loss in television ratings for networks that cover NBA games such as the [[regional sports network]]s, [[NBA on TNT|TNT]] and [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Rich |last=Thomaselli |title=NBA Lockout Would Put $1B in TV Ad Revenue at Stake |date=January 17, 2011 |work=Advertising Age |url=http://adage.com/article/news/nba-lockout-put-1b-tv-ad-revenue-stake/148243/ |accessdate=November 25, 2011 }}</ref>

The league built a new schedule from scratch based on available arena dates.  In October, the league had allowed arenas in [[Staples Center|Los Angeles]] and [[United Center|Chicago]] to reassign NBA dates for other events. The number of games between conferences was affected as was the case in the 1999 lockout, when each team played only five or six interconference games in a 50-game schedule.  Normally, each team plays teams in the other conference twice each.<ref name=beck_10262011/> Teams played 48&nbsp;conference games and 18&nbsp;non-conference games in a 66-game schedule, compared to 52&nbsp;conference games and 30&nbsp;non-conference games in a normal 82-game season.<ref>{{cite news |last=Banks |first=Lacy J. |title=NBA<U+2019>s 66-game schedule is definitely hectic |date=November 27, 2011 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/basketball/bulls/9102076-579/nbas-66-game-schedule-is-definitely-hectic.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63gZFSLVD |archivedate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> Teams played on average two more games per month and also played three-consecutive games at least once in the season.
