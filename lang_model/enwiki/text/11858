The '''Thaddeus McCotter presidential campaign of 2012''' began when [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Thaddeus McCotter]] of [[Michigan]] filed papers with the [[Federal Election Commission]] on July 1, 2011, announcing his intention to run for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. He officially announced his candidacy the next day at a rock festival near [[Detroit]].

McCotter, who had served in Congress since 2003, was first mentioned as a potential presidential candidate on an April 2011 episode of [[Fox News]]' ''[[Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld]]''. After entering the race two months later, McCotter based his campaign on "five core principles" listed on his campaign website, and used the slogan ''Seize Freedom!'', derived from the title of his 2011 book. During the campaign, he focused on reform of government and [[Wall Street]].

Commentators noted McCotter's lack of [[name recognition]] hindered his chances for nomination. When included in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Republican Party 2012 presidential primaries|Republican presidential preference polls]], he regularly received less than one percent support. Following a last place finish in the [[Ames Straw Poll]] and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed [[Mitt Romney]]. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a [[television pilot]], which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 [[Thaddeus McCotter#2012 Congressional campaign and petition scandal|amid a fraud investigation]] surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.

==Background==
{{main|Thaddeus McCotter}}
Thaddeus McCotter began his political career upon election to the [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] (Michigan) Commission in 1993. Five years later, he left that position after winning a seat in the [[Michigan State Senate]].<ref name="congress">{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.org/bio/id/851|title=Rep.

In Congress, leadership assigned McCotter to the [[House Financial Services Committee]]. In addition, he joined the moderate [[Republican Main Street Partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iowaindependent.com/58080/little-known-mccotter-makes-2012-run-official|title=Little known McCotter makes 2012 run official|last=Malloy|first=Meghan|date=July 5, 2011|work=[[American Independent News Network|The Iowa Independent]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> In 2006, he attained the chairmanship of the [[House Republican Policy Committee]], and two years later was named head of his party's Fiscal Integrity Task Force.

He also supported an increase in the [[minimum wage]] and advocated [[fair trade]] with [[China]]. Nevertheless, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' described him as a "conservative's conservative"<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=July 11, 2011|last=Spangler|first=Todd|title=Thad McCotter's White House bid: A long shot to keep an eye on}}</ref> and [[GovTrack]] labeled him a "far-right Republican".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400260|title=Rep.

McCotter was also known as an "oddball" in Congress, displaying a wry sense of humor. Betsy Woodruff of ''[[National Review]]'' identified him as "the strangest Congressman."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/322406/strangest-congressman-betsy-woodruff|title=The Strangest Congressman|last=Woodruff|first=Betsy|date=September 19, 2012|work=[[National Review]]|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref> Showing a fondness for [[rock music]], he played lead guitar in the [[Second Amendments]],<ref name="po"/> and quoted [[Led Zeppelin]] lyrics on the floor of the House.<ref name="re"/> President [[George W.

According to [[Matt Lewis (journalist)|Matt Lewis]] of ''[[The Daily Caller]]'', McCotter was "The Red Eye candidate", who represented a subculture of "creative think[ing]" [[libertarian]]-leaning Republicans, who enjoy rock music.<ref name="re">{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/05/24/the-red-eye-candidate/|title=The Red Eye candidate?|last=Lewis|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Lewis (journalist)|date=May 24, 2011|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|accessdate=August 3, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' described his celebrity as a "tiny cult following of insomniac conservatives."<ref name="bb">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-31/run-for-president-kill-your-career|title=Run for President, Kill Your Career|last=Green|first=Joshua|coauthors=Elizabeth Dwoskin|date=May 31, 2012|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|authorlink=Joshua Green|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Campaign speculation==
[[File:Thad McCotter.jpg|thumb|McCotter addresses the [[Republican Leadership Conference]] on June 16, 2011.|alt=McCotter stands at a podium with his right arm bent at the elbow and facing up]]
Speculation about a presidential run began several months after the release of his February 2011 book ''Seize Freedom! American Truths and Renewal in a Chaotic Age''. The first instance occurred during the April 22 episode of ''Red Eye'', where host [[Greg Gutfeld]] asked McCotter to enter the presidential race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4657219/gutfeld-thaddeus-mccotter-should-run-for-president/|title=Gutfeld: Thaddeus McCotter Should Run for President|date=April 22, 2011|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref> Five days later, political commentator and fellow ''Red Eye'' frequenter [[S.E. Cupp]] listed McCotter as a potential candidate in her ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' column.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-27/news/29494465_1_guitar-hero-president-obama-harvard-law-school|title=Thaddeus McCotter, guitar hero and 2012 dark horse: A Michigan star rises in Washington|last=Cupp|first=S.E.|authorlink=S.E.

He told the newspaper ''[[Politico]]'' he felt most Republicans lacked enthusiasm for the current crop of candidates. Commentator [[Andrew Breitbart]] expressed excitement at the prospect of a McCotter run. Describing him as "blunt, sarcastic, pop-culture-savvy, constitutionally sound and an authentic voice," Breitbart remarked {{nowrap|"[t]here's}} no one I'd like to see more at a debate than McCotter."<ref name="po">{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55546.html|title=Thaddeus McCotter weighing White House bid|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|date=May 24, 2011|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2011, speculation increased as McCotter attacked Republican frontrunner [[Mitt Romney]] as Romney visited Detroit. He connected Romney to President [[Barack Obama]], arguing that people see Romney and Obama as [[running mate]]s rather than as rivals.<ref>{{cite web | title=McCotter bashes Romney for anti-auto sentiments|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=June 9, 2011|last=Hurst|first=Nathan}}</ref> Later that month, he addressed the [[Republican Leadership Conference]] in [[New Orleans]] and entered the event's [[straw poll]].

Three days after the straw poll, McCotter wrote an article in ''National Review'' outlining some of his economic plans.  He advocated spending reductions, a twenty percent [[reserve requirement]] for banks to keep available as capital, and incentives to reduce home foreclosures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/23/thaddeus-mccotter/thaddeus-mccotter-says-lenders-lose-30-percent-for/|title=Thaddeus McCotter says lenders lose 30 percent on foreclosures|date=August 23, 2011|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref> He campaigned in New Hampshire on August 19, and filmed "Conversation with the Candidate" for {{nowrap|[[WMUR-TV]]}}.

McCotter continued his efforts to be included in the debates in September. In an interview with ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' he said the other candidates "don't understand what's wrong with the economy, let alone how to fix it",<ref name="bolton">{{cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/09/gop-presidential-candidate-thaddeus-mccotter-on-why-he-should-be-allowed-to-debate/|title=GOP presidential candidate Thaddeus McCotter on why he should be allowed to debate|last=Pappas|first=Alex|date=September 9, 2011|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref> and that foreign policy was not being discussed enough. He observed that since former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|United Nations ambassador]] [[John R. Bolton]] announced he would not run for president, foreign policy discussion had ceased.

On September 9, McCotter made his last campaign trip to New Hampshire, attending events for two days.<ref name="nh"/> He was supposed to appear in Iowa again five days later, but had to cancel due to a vote in Congress.<ref name="ia"/> While in Washington, he introduced a [[Grover Norquist]]-backed [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] [[Social Security debate in the United States|reform]] plan, which would have created private accounts for those under {{nowrap|50 years}} of age with limited guaranteed government benefits.

===Withdrawal===
On September 22, 2011, McCotter notified ''[[The Detroit News]]'' he would withdraw from the presidential race. He explained it "was sort of death by media" because of the exclusion from the presidential debates, and argued "if they keep you out of the debates, you are out of the conversation and you can't run."<ref name="dn">{{cite news|title=McCotter drops long shot bid for GOP presidential nomination|last=Shepardson|first=David|coauthors=Marisa Schultz|date=September 22, 2011|work=The Detroit News}}</ref> He then released a statement in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, and called on the Republican Party to unite behind Romney as the most electable candidate.  In the press release, McCotter also announced that he would run for re-election in his congressional district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.p2012.org/mccotter/mccotter092211st.html|title=Rep.

In reporting on the withdrawal, the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, "What's that? You've never heard of Thaddeus McCotter? Well, that's the main reason he's now a former candidate."<ref name="lat-wd"/> Pundit [[Bill Ballenger]] of ''Inside Michigan Politics'' said that McCotter "really had no business running for president. If he wants to have any political future, endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do." McCotter's neighbor, former [[Michigan Attorney General]] [[Mike Cox]], remarked, "He tried it out, obviously it wasn't working. And he's doing the rational thing and dropping out."<ref name="dn"/> [[Steve Kornacki]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' summarized the overall campaign as "a cautionary tale about what can go wrong when your average backbench member of Congress becomes a minor cable news celebrity and mistakes it for having a genuine national following."<ref name="salon">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/the_sad_story_of_thaddeus_mccotter/|title=The sad story of Thaddeus McCotter|last=Kornacki|first=Steve||authorlink=Steve Kornacki|date=May 29, 2012|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=August 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
A few days after the campaign ended, ''The Detroit News'' asked McCotter whether he enjoyed his presidential campaign, he replied, "No. It was the worst {{nowrap|15 minutes}} of my life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2011/09/24/bonus_quote_of_the_day.html|title=Bonus Quote of the Day|date=September 24, 2011|work=[[Political Wire]]|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>  Fundraising totals for the three months of McCotter's run were released to the FEC in October 2011. Overall, he raised $548,606 ($468,561 of which was transferred from authorized committees), paid $541,532 on expenses, and had a debt of $105,367.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.nictusa.com/pdf/912/12950305912/12950305912.pdf#navpanes=0|title=October Quarterly (McCotter2012) (Amended)|date=January 31, 2012|publisher=Federal Election Commission|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref> As of June 2013, a debt of $105,636 remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.nictusa.com/pdf/736/13963179736/13963179736.pdf#navpanes=0|title=July Quarterly (McCotter2012)|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=Federal Election Commission|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'' ahead of the [[Michigan Republican primary, 2012|Michigan primary]] in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had the best chance to overcome the obstacles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/02/primary-day-in-michigan-thad-mccotter-is-worried-his-state-is-still-obama-country.html|title=Primary Day in Michigan: Thad McCotter Is Worried His State Is Still Obama Country|last=Cogan|first=Marin|date=February 28, 2012|work=[[GQ]]|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>

Though McCotter had decided to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the majority of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2012/05/29/mccotter-campaign-investigated-for-election-fraud/|title=McCotter Campaign Investigated For Election Fraud|date=May 29, 2012|publisher=[[WWJ-TV]]|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref> McCotter argued that "somebody either panicked or it was sabotage...

A day prior to his resignation from Congress, ''The Detroit News'' reported that after ending his presidential campaign, McCotter took to writing a [[television pilot]] he titled, "Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown". It centered around McCotter as the host of a variety show with characters based on his congressional staffers, who made fun of his presidential campaign and discussed such risqu<U+00E9> topics as sex, race, and bodily functions.<ref name="tv"/> In one scene in the script, S.E. Cupp guest stars; McCotter tries to conduct a serious interview with her, but the other characters make sexually explicit comments, leading Cupp to describe the show as a "train wreck."<ref name="tv"/> A former staffer released the work to the media to show what McCotter did while in office. In response, McCotter denied any wrongdoing, saying it had been largely composed in his garage as a way to get over his failed presidential campaign. He said the script was unfinished and had not authorized it for release, but decided to discuss it with ''The News''. He cited comedian [[Martin Mull]]'s short-lived 1977 show ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]'' as an inspiration, and revealed that he had planned to leave Congress in 2014 and was preparing for a future career.<ref name="tv">{{cite news|title=TV pilot an outlet for Rep.
