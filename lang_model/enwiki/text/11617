'''''Halloween''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[media franchise|franchise]] that consists of nine [[slasher film]]s, [[novel]]s, and [[comic book]]s. The franchise focuses on the fictional character of [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] who was committed to [[Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium|Smith's Grove Sanitarium]] as a child for the murder of his older sister. Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of [[Haddonfield, Illinois]] while being chased by his former psychiatrist [[Dr. Sam Loomis]]. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of [[Halloween]], on which all of the films primarily take place.

The original film, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', was released in [[1978 in film|1978]]. Written by [[John Carpenter]] and [[Debra Hill]], and directed by John Carpenter, the sequels have had various writers and directors attached to them. Michael Myers is the antagonist in all of the films except ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'', which has no direct connection to any other ''Halloween'' film in the series. Carpenter, who had a hand in writing the first sequel, has not had any direct involvement with the rest of the films. The film series is ranked fourth at the [[United States]] box office &ndash; in adjusted 2008 dollars &ndash; when compared to other American horror franchises. The first ''Halloween'' film is credited with beginning a long line of slasher films inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. The franchise began when the first novel appeared less than a year after the release of the film, and eight sequels have followed.

===Overview===
The original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), written and directed by [[John Carpenter]], tells the story of [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] as he stalks and kills teenage [[babysitting|babysitters]] on Halloween night. The film begins with six-year-old Michael (Will Sandin) killing his seventeen-year-old sister [[Judith Myers|Judith]] ([[Sandy Johnson]]) on Halloween 1963. He is subsequently hospitalized at [[Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium|Smith's Grove Sanitarium]]. Fifteen years later, Michael ([[Nick Castle]] and Tony Moran) escapes and returns to his hometown where he stalks Laurie Strode ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) and her friends as they babysit. The film ends with Michael being shot six times by his psychiatrist, [[Dr. Sam Loomis]] ([[Donald Pleasence]]).<ref name="H1">{{cite video|people=[[John Carpenter|Carpenter, John]] (Writer/Director) and Debra Hill (Writer)|title=[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Compass International Pictures]]|year=1978}}</ref> ''[[Halloween II]]'' (1981) picks up where the events of ''Halloween'' left off. Michael's body is missing from the front lawn, where it fell when Loomis shot him. Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital, killing everyone who gets between him and Laurie. The story reveals that Laurie is actually Michael's sister: she was given up for adoption as an infant. Michael corners Loomis and Laurie in an operating room, where Loomis causes an explosion as Laurie escapes. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room toward Laurie before finally falling dead.<ref name="H2">{{cite video|people=Rosenthal, Rick (Director), [[John Carpenter]], and Debra Hill (Writers)|title=[[Halloween II]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|year=1981}}</ref>

The story line of the third ''Halloween'' film, subtitled ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch|Season of the Witch]]'' (1982), has no connection to the previous two ''Halloween'' films. ''Season of the Witch'' follows the story of Dr. Challis ([[Tom Atkins]]) as he tries to solve the mysterious murder of a patient in his hospital. He, along with the patient's daughter Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), travels to the small town of Santa Mira, California. The pair discover that Silver Shamrock Novelties, a company run by Conal Cochran ([[Dan O'Herlihy]]), is attempting to use the mystic powers of the [[Stonehenge]] rocks to resurrect the ancient aspects of the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] festival, [[Samhain]], which Cochran connects to witchcraft. Cochran is using his Silver Shamrock Halloween masks to achieve his goal, which will be achieved when all the children wearing his masks watch the Silver Shamrock commercial airing Halloween night. Challis contacts the television stations and convinces all but one of the station managers to remove the commercial. The film ends with Challis screaming for the final station to turn off the commercial.<ref name="H3">{{cite video|people=Wallace, Tommy Lee (Writer/Director)|title=[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|year=1982}}</ref>

''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988), as the title suggests, features the return of Michael Myers ([[George P. Wilbur]]) to the film series. The film reveals that Michael survived the fire in ''Halloween II'' but has been in a coma since that night. While being transferred back to Smith's Grove, Michael comes out of his coma and overhears that Laurie Strode, who died in a car accident, has a daughter, [[Jamie Lloyd]] ([[Danielle Harris]]). Michael escapes the transport heads to Haddonfield in search of Jamie. Fellow survivor Dr. Loomis also goes to Haddonfield after learning that Michael has escaped transfer. Eventually the town residents track Michael down and shoot him several times before he falls down a mine shaft.<ref name="H4">{{cite video|people=Little, Dwight (Director) and Allan McElroy (Writer)|title=[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=Galaxy International Releasing|year=1988}}</ref> Picking up directly where the previous film ends, ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989) has Michael ([[Don Shanks]]) surviving the gunshots, and the fall down the mine; he stumbles upon a hermit who bandages him up. One year later, and showing signs of a metaphysical connection to Jamie, Michael tracks Jamie to a local child mental health clinic. Using Jamie as bait, Loomis manages to capture Michael. The film ends with Michael being taken into police custody, only to be broken out of jail by a mysterious stranger, all dressed in black.<ref name="H5">{{cite video|people= Othenin-Girard, Dominique (Director), Michael Jacobs, Dominique Othenin-Girard, and Shem Bitterman (Writers)|title=[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=Galaxy International Releasing|year=1989}}</ref>

''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995) picks up the story approximately six years after the events of ''The Revenge of Michael Myers''. The mysterious stranger who broke Michael out of jail kidnaps Jamie Lloyd ([[J. C. Brandy]]) in an effort to obtain her illegitimate child. Jamie escapes with her newborn, with Michael (George P. Wilbur) in pursuit. Michael kills Jamie and continues searching for her baby; the infant is found by Tommy Doyle ([[Paul Rudd|Paul Stephen Rudd]])&mdash;the young boy who was babysat by Laurie Strode in the first film&mdash;who brings it home for safety. It is revealed that Michael is driven by the Curse of [[Thorn (letter)|Thorn]], which forces a person to kill their entire family in order to save all of civilization. The mysterious stranger is revealed to be Dr. Loomis<U+2019>s colleague, Dr. Wynn ([[Mitchell Ryan]]), who is part of a group of people who protect the chosen individual so that they may complete their task. With the help of Kara Strode ([[Marianne Hagan]]), Laurie<U+2019>s would-be cousin, Tommy keeps the infant from Michael, who slaughters Wynn and his followers. Michael is finally subdued by Tommy, who injects him with large quantities of tranquilizers inside the Smith<U+2019>s Grove Sanitarium. The film ends with Loomis walking back into the sanitarium to find Michael.<ref name="H6">{{cite video|people= Chappelle, Joe (Director) and Daniel Farrands (Writer)|title=[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Miramax Films]]|year=1995}}</ref>

The events that transpire between ''Halloween 4'' and ''Halloween 6'' are effectively ignored in 1998<U+2019>s ''[[Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later]]''. This film opens twenty years after the events of the second film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has faked her own death so that she could go into hiding from her brother Michael. Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate, Laurie continues to live in fear of her brother<U+2019>s return. Her own son, John ([[Josh Hartnett]]), attends school where she teaches. Laurie<U+2019>s fear becomes reality when Michael (Chris Durand) shows up at the school and begins killing John<U+2019>s friends and eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face. Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend ([[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]) to safety, but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead, Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael.<ref name="H7">{{cite video|people= Miner, Steve (Director), Robert Zapia, and Matt Greenberg (Writers)|title=[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Dimension Films]]|year=1998}}</ref> ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' (2002) picks up three years after ''H20'', and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramedic<U+2014>crushing the paramedic<U+2019>s [[larynx]] so that he could not talk<U+2014>and that was who Laurie killed. Unable to deal with killing an innocent man, and the fact that Michael was still out there, Laurie is committed to a mental institution. Michael (Brad Loree) shows up at the institution, but Laurie captures him. Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her, and when she attempts to remove Michael<U+2019>s mask he surprises and kills her. Michael travels back to his family home in Haddonfield, but finds a group of college students filming an [[Reality television|Internet reality show]]. Michael proceeds to kill everyone, until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student, Sara Moyer ([[Bianca Kajlich]]), and the show<U+2019>s creator Freddie Harris ([[Busta Rhymes]]).<ref name="H8">{{cite video|people= Rosenthal, Rick (Director), Larry Brand, and Sean Hood (Writers)|title=[[Halloween: Resurrection]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Dimension Films]]|year=2002}}</ref>

[[Halloween (2007 film)|A remake]] of the original ''Halloween'' was released in 2007. This film focuses on the events that lead Michael Myers ([[Daeg Faerch]]) to kill his family. It also identifies Laurie as Michael<U+2019>s sister early on, which was something not done in the original film, but was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] into its sequel. Michael shows early signs of psychopathic behavior at the age of ten, possessing an affinity for torturing and killing animals. On Halloween, Michael murders a school bully, his sister, and her boyfriend, as well as his mother<U+2019>s boyfriend. He does not harm his infant sister, but acts more as her protector. Committed to Smith<U+2019>s Grove Sanitarium, Michael closes himself off from everyone, only concerning himself with his [[papier-m<U+00E2>ch<U+00E9>]] masks. Seventeen years later, Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]) escapes and heads to Haddonfield to find his younger sister, with his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) in pursuit. Michael finds his sister living with the Strode family. After killing all of her friends and family, Michael kidnaps Laurie and attempts to explain through the use of a picture that he has kept of himself and Laurie that she is his sister. Unable to understand, Laurie fights back; she is saved by Loomis, who guns down Michael in an empty pool. Michael returns, kidnapping Laurie again, but this time the two fall over a balcony. With Loomis<U+2019>s gun pointed at an unconscious Michael<U+2019>s face, Laurie begins firing through the empty bullet casings until firing the last remaining bullet just as Michael<U+2019>s hand grabs her wrist.<ref name="H9">{{cite video|people= Zombie, Rob (Writer/Director)|title=[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[Dimension Films]]|year=2007}}</ref>

===Development===
After viewing John Carpenter's film ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976) at the [[Milan]] [[Film festival|Film Festival]], independent [[film producer]] [[Irwin Yablans]] and [[film finance|financier]] [[Moustapha Akkad]] sought out Carpenter to direct for them a film about a psychotic killer stalking babysitters.<ref name="halloweenmovies">{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h1bts.htm|publisher=Halloween Movies|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Carpenter and [[Debra Hill]] began drafting a story titled ''The Babysitter Murders'', but the title was changed at Yablans request, suggesting the setting be changed to Halloween night and naming it ''Halloween'' instead.<ref name="Carpenterinterview">{{cite web|title=John Carpenter interview|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h1bts.htm|publisher=Halloween Movies|work=Halloween Movies|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Mustapha Akkad fronted the $325,000 for the film's budget,<ref name="halloweenmovies"/> even though he was worried about the tight schedule, low budget, and Carpenter's limited experience as a filmmaker. He finally decided to finance the film after Carpenter relayed the entire film to Akkad, "in a suspenseful way, almost frame for frame", and opted not to take any fees for directing the film.<ref name="Carpenterinterview"/> The low budget forced wardrobe and props to be crafted from items on hand or that could be purchased inexpensively; this included the trademark mask worn by Michael Myers throughout the film. [[Production designer]], [[art director]], [[location scouting|location scout]] and co-editor [[Tommy Lee Wallace]] created Michael's mask from a [[William Shatner]] Halloween mask, purchased for $1.98.<ref name="halloweenmovies"/> The limited budget also dictated the filming location and time schedule. ''Halloween'' was filmed in 21 days in the spring of 1978 primarily in [[South Pasadena, California]]. An abandoned house owned by a church stood in as the Myers house. Two homes on Orange Grove Avenue in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] were used for the film's climax.<ref name="Halloween">{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Halloween/index.shtml|title=Halloween Filming Locations|publisher=Seeing Stars|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Halloween'', Yablans and Akkad began working on ''Halloween II'', which boasted a much larger budget than its predecessor: $2.5 million. Irwin Yablans and Moustapha Akkad invested heavily in this film, even though John Carpenter refused to direct. Most of the film was shot at Morningside Hospital in [[Los Angeles, California]], and Pasadena Community Hospital in [[Pasadena, California]].<ref name="Hillinterview">{{cite web|title=Debra Hill interview|work=[[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]]|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h2bts.htm|publisher=Halloween Movies|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> There was initial discussion about filming ''Halloween II'' in [[3-D film|3-D]], but the idea never came to fruitation. After ''Halloween II'' was released, Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third ''Halloween'' film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair agreed to participate in the new project only if it was not a direct sequel to ''Halloween II'', which meant no Michael Myers.<ref name="Carlomagno1">{{cite journal|author= Carlomagno, Ellen|title=Halloween III: Season of the Witch: An On-The-Set Report On The Ambitious Sequel to Carpenter's Classic!|journal=[[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]]|issue=22|date=October 1982|pages=8}}</ref>  Most of the filming took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in [[Humboldt County, California]]. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.<ref name="bts">{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes of ''Halloween III''|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h3bts.htm|publisher=Halloween Movies|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

After ''Halloween III'' was released, Michael Myers was brought back into the franchise with 1988's ''The Return of Michael Myers'', where he has stayed for the remainder of the series. Four more sequels would follow, between 1988 and 2002, after ''The Return of Michael Myers'' before the series would take a break for five years. On [[June 4]], [[2006]], [[Dimension Films|Dimension]] announced that [[Rob Zombie]], director of ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', would be creating the next installment in the ''Halloween'' franchise. Bob Weinstein approached Rob Zombie about making the film, and Zombie, who was a fan of the original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', and friend of [[John Carpenter]], jumped at the chance to make a ''Halloween'' film for Dimension Studios.<ref name="Zombie">{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9/zombierelease.html|publisher=Halloween Movies|title=New ''Halloween'' film|date=2006-06-04|accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform John Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film.<ref name="plot-interview">{{cite web|title=Halloween: On Set With Director Rob Zombie!|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/354|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070826120122/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/354|archivedate=2007-08-26|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|date=2007-03-19|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Carpenter's request was for Zombie to "make it his own [film]".<ref name="Make own">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/338/4589/Zombie,-Rob.html|title=Rob Zombie to Re-Make ''Halloween''|publisher=The Gauntlet|date=2006-06-04|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> During a [[June 16]], [[2006]] interview, Rob Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, and there would be considerable original content in the new film.<ref name="Zombie interview">{{citeweb|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9_lobby.html|publisher=Halloween Movies|title=Interview with Rob|date=2006-06-16|accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>

Zombie wanted to reinvent the character, as he felt Michael, along with [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]], and [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], had become too familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary.<ref name="MTV interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/flickd/z/rob_zombie_061026/|title=Evil Reborn: Zombie resurrects a horror classic|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> The idea was to delve deeper into [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers's]] back story. Michael's mask was even given its own story, to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film.<ref name="MTV interview 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1554005/20070306/story.jhtml|title=Zombie Kills 'Halloween' Theme Song, Revokes Myers' Driver's License|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=2007-03-07|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Zombie wanted to bring Michael closer to what a [[psychopath]] really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide.<ref name="plot-interview"/> Moreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield.<ref name="MTV interview 2"/> Zombie also wanted the Dr. Loomis character to be more intertwined with that of Michael Myers, as opposed to what Zombie saw, in the original film, as showing up merely to say something dramatic.<ref name="MTV interview"/> Although Zombie was adding new content to the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme tune intact for his version.<ref name="Zombie interview"/>

===Music===
John Carpenter composed the music to the first three films. For ''Halloween'', Carpenter chose to use a [[piano]] [[melody]] played in a [[time signature|5/4 time]] [[metre (music)|rhythm]] instead of a [[symphonic]] soundtrack. Critic [[James Berardinelli]] calls the score "relatively simple and unsophisticated", but admits that "''Halloween''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music is one of its strongest assets."<ref name="Berardinellireview">{{cite news|author=James Berardinelli|title=Review of ''Halloween''|url=http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/h/halloween.html|publisher=ReelViews.com|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Carpenter stated in an interview, "I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note."<ref name="Carpenterinterview" /> In the end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the "Bowling Green Orchestra" for performing the film's score, but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at [[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]].<ref name="halloweenmovies"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Dan Wyman's faculty website|url=http://www.music.sjsu.edu/admin/faculty/wyman/index.html|publisher=[[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]]|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>

{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}{{Listen|filename=Halloweentheme.ogg|title=''Halloween'' theme|description=John Carpenter's theme for the original ''Halloween'', which was reproduced for the sequels|format=[[Ogg]]}}{{sample box end}}

The score for ''Halloween II'' is a variation of John Carpenter's compositions from the first film, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played. The score was performed on a [[synthesizer|synthesizer organ]] rather than the piano used for ''Halloween''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Howarth biography|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/cast/ah.htm|publisher=HalloweenMovies.com|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> One reviewer for the [[BBC]] described the revised score as having "a more Gothic feel". The reviewer asserted that it "doesn<U+2019>t sound quite as good as the original piece", but "it still remains a classic piece of music".<ref name="BBCreview">{{cite news|title="More of the Night He Came Home", review of ''Halloween II''|publisher==[[BBC Collective]]|date=[[2003-10-23]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1910459|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>

Music remained an important element in establishing the atmosphere of ''Halloween III''. Just as in ''Halloween'' and ''Halloween II'', there was no symphonic score.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-30|url=http://www.hitsquad.com/news/blog/the_halloween_soundtrack/|title=Composing for horror: The Halloween soundtrack |publisher=Hitsquad }}</ref> Much of the music was composed to solicit "false [[Startle reaction|startles]]" from the audience.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Startle Effect: Implications for Spectator Cognition and Media Theory|author=Baird, Robert|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=53|issue=3|date=Spring 2000|pages=12<U+2013>24}}</ref> The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, who had also worked on the score for ''Halloween II''.  The score of ''Halloween III'' differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower, electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping [[tonality|tonalities]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Soundtrack of ''Halloween III''|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h3soundtrack.htm|publisher=HalloweenMovies.com|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film:<blockquote>The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a [[time code]]d video tape and synchronized to a 24 track [[Master recording|master audio recorder]]; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has 'instant gratification', allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture.

===Critical reception===
In addition to weak box office returns, most critics gave ''Halloween III'' negative reviews. Whereas ''Halloween'' had broken new ground and was imitated by genre films following in its wake, this third installment seemed hackneyed to many: one critic suggests that if ''Halloween III'' was not part of the ''Halloween'' series, then it would simply be "a fairly nondescript eighties horror flick, no worse and no better than many others."<ref name="Harperbook">{{cite book|title=Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies|author=Harper, Jim|publisher=Critical Vision|isbn=1900486393|url=http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Blood-Comprehensive-Slasher-Movies/dp/1900486393}}</ref>

==Literature==
===Novels===
When the original ''Halloween'' was released in 1978, [[Halloween (novel)|a novelization of the movie]] followed just a year later. Written by Curtis Richards, the book follows the events of the film, but expands on the festival of [[Samhain]] and Michael's time at Smith's Grove Sanitarium.<ref>{{cite book|author= Richards, Curtis|url=http://www.amazon.com/Halloween-Curtis-Richards/dp/0553132261/|title=[[Halloween (novel)|Halloween]]|date=October 1979|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|isbn=0553132261}}</ref> ''Halloween II'' and ''Halloween 4'' each received novelizations as well. Jack Martin would write ''Halloween II'', which was released alongside its film counterpart. Martin included an additional victim of Michael's in this novel.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Dennis Etchison|Etchison, Dennis]]|url=http://www.amazon.com/HALLOWEEN-II-Jack-Martin/dp/089083864X/|title=Halloween II (novel)|date=[[1981-11-01]]|publisher=Zebra Publishing|isbn=089083864X}}</ref> ''Halloween IV'', released in [[October 1988]] and written by Nicholas Grabowsky, also followed the events of the film in which it was adapted from.<ref>{{cite book|author= Grabowsky, Nicholas|url=http://www.amazon.com/Halloween-IV-Nicholas-Grabowsky/dp/1555472923/|title=Halloween IV (novel)|date=October 1988|publisher=Critics Choice Paperbacks/Lorevan Publishing|isbn=1555472923}}</ref>

Over a four month period, [[Berkley Books]] published three [[Young-adult fiction|young adult novels]] written by Kelly O'Rourke; the novels are original stories created by O'Rourke, with no direct continuity with the films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/kellyorourke_lobby.html|title=Interview with Kelly O'Rourke|publisher=Halloween Movies|date=2006-01-05|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> The first, released on [[October 1]], [[1997]], titled ''The Scream Factory'', follows a group of friends who set up a haunted house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall, only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while they are there.<ref>{{cite book|author= O'Rourke, Kelly|url=http://www.amazon.com/Scream-Factory-Halloween-Book/dp/157297298X/|title=The Scream Factory (Halloween, Book 1)|date=[[1997-10-01]]|publisher=[[Berkley Books]]|isbn=157297298X}}</ref> ''The Old Myers Place'' is the second novel, released [[December 1]], [[1997]], and focuses on Mary White, who moves into the Myers house with her family. Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends.<ref>{{cite book|author= O'Rourke, Kelly|url=http://www.amazon.com/Old-Myers-Place-Halloween-Book/dp/1572973412/|title=The Old Myers Place (Halloween, Book 2)|date=[[1997-12-01]]|publisher=[[Berkley Books]]|isbn=1572973412}}</ref> O'Rourke's final novel, ''The Mad House'', was released on [[February 1]], [[1998]]. ''The Mad House'' features a young girl, Christine Ray, who joins a documentary film crew that travels to haunted locations; they are currently headed to Smith Grove Mental Hospital, where they are confronted by Michael.<ref>{{cite book|author= O'Rourke, Kelly|url=http://www.amazon.com/Mad-House-Halloween-Book/dp/1572973420/|title=The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)|date=[[1998-02-01]]|publisher=[[Berkley Books]]|isbn=1572973420}}</ref>

===Comic books===
The first ''Halloween'' comic was published by [[Brian Pulido]]'s [[Chaos Comics]]. Simply titled ''Halloween'', it was intended to be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: ''Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes'' and ''Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes''. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands<U+2014>writer for ''Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers''<U+2014>assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film ''Halloween H20''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/Comic_Maniac.htm|title=Halloween&nbsp;<U+2014> Michael Myers comic book titles|publisher=Movie Maniacs Comic Books|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>

''One Good Scare'' was released in 2003; it was written by Stefan Hutchinson and illustrated by Peter Fielding. The main character in this comic is Lindsey Wallace, the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film. Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots, and away from the "lumbering Jason-clone" the film sequels had made him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=455|title=The Arrow interviews Stefan Hutchinson|publisher=Arrow in the Head|date=2003-11-28|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> On [[July 25]], [[2006]], as an insert inside the DVD release of ''Halloween: 25 Years of Terror'', Hutchinson released ''Halloween: Autopsis''. Written by Hutchinson, and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas, the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers. As the photographer, Carter, follows Dr. Loomis he begins to take on Loomis's obsession himself, until finally meeting Michael Myers in person, which results in his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/6765|title=Halloween: Autopsis|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|date=2006-07-12|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>

In 2008, Stefan Hutchinson released the first issue of his new comic book, ''Halloween: Nightdance''. This is a four issue mini-series, and it does not contain any characters<U+2014>other than Michael<U+2014>from the films.<ref name="Nightdance">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicmonsters.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=864|title=Stefan Hutchinson talks Halloween|publisher=Horror Comic Book News|date=2007-11-20|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> The four issues are titled, "A Shape in the Void", "The Silent Clown", "A Rainbow in One Color", and "When The Stars Came Crashing Down".<ref name="Nightdance2">{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweencomics.com/|title=Halloween: Nightdance issue titles and descriptions|publisher=Halloween Comics|accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> The first issue, "A Shape in the Void", takes place on [[October 31]], [[2000]], so that it falls between ''Halloween H20'' and ''Halloween Resurrection''. Issue one follows Michael as he stalks Lisa, a fifteen year-old girl with insecurities and "a chronic fear of darkness".<ref name="Nightdance"/> Hutchinson explains that ''Nightdance'' is an attempt to escape the dense continuity of the film series and recreate the tone of the 1978 film.  Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa, just as he did with Laurie in the original ''Halloween'', before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her.<ref name="HalloweenFeb">{{cite news|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=145520|title=Halloween in February: Hutchinson and Seeley on ''Halloween: Nightdance''|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=2008-02-04|accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref>  The upcoming ''Halloween 30th Anniversary Special'' comic book from Devil's Due will celebrate the franchise's thirtieth anniversary with a collection of short stories inspired by John Carpenter's original film.  Writer Stef Hutchinson explains that ''H30'' came about because, unlike previous decades, there was no ''Halloween'' film coming out in 2008 to celebrate the occasion.<ref name=H30>{{cite news|author=Steve Ekstrom|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080605-Halloween30th.html|title=Celebrating 30 Years of Halloween|publisher=Newsarama|date=[[2008-05-06]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref>

==Merchandise==
The ''Halloween'' franchise has also seen profitability through various merchandise like toys, dolls, statues, model kits, bobbleheads, snow globes, movie posters, masks, T-shirts, hats, and more. Michael Myers has made appearances in the form of dolls and toys from [[McFarlane Toys]], Sideshow Collectibles, and [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-30|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000S5EXRI|title=Halloween Michael Myers Mcfarlane Movie Maniacs |publisher=Amazon.com }}</ref> Even Dr. Loomis has been immortalized in plastic alongside Michael Myers in a two-figure set produced by NECA.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-30|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002RQYL0|title=Halloween Movie: Michael Myers & Dr. Loomis Action Figure Box set by NECA |publisher=Amazon.com }}</ref>

The Michael Myers mask has been reproduced over the years by Don Post, the mask company responsible for the creation of the masks from several of the ''Halloween'' films (the Silver Shamrock novelty factory seen in ''Halloween III'' was actually shot on location in one of Don Post's factories).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-30|url=http://www.halloween-online.com/costumes/halloween-costumes-michael.html|title=Michael Myers Costume |publisher=Halloween Online }}</ref> While Don Post reproductions of the Michael Myers mask are still commonly found in costume stores every Halloween, the license to produce Michael Myers masks has since been given to Cinema Secrets, the company commissioned with the creation of the Michael Myers mask for ''Halloween: Resurrection''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Unmasking Copyright Companies Face Off Over Film Prop|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=2000-11-01|page=B01|author=Slobodzian, Joseph A.}}</ref>

The ''Halloween'' series also lives on in DVD form. Many versions of the original ''Halloween'' (often including special extras like free merchandise or additional footage missing from previous DVD releases of the film) as well as several of its sequels have been published by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]], [[Universal Studios]], and [[Dimension Films]]. On [[October 2]], [[2007]], the original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' was sold on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] for the first time by Anchor Bay Home Entertainment. In December 2007 there were reports that the Producer's Cut of ''[[Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' might get a DVD release in the future.<ref name="producers cut">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=5606|title=December 11: HALLOWEEN: CURSE <U+201C>producer<U+2019>s cut<U+201D> to appear? |publisher=[[Fangoria]] }}</ref><ref name="reissued">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20071212_curse_of_michael_myers_reissue.html|title=Curse of Michael Myers re-issued? |publisher=Movie Hole|date=2007-12-12|author=Morris, Clint }}</ref>
