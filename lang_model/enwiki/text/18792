'''Camouflage''' is a method of concealment that allows an otherwise visible [[animal]], military vehicle, or other object to remain unnoticed by blending with its environment. Examples include a [[leopard]]'s spotted coat, the [[battledress]] of a modern [[soldier]] and a leaf-mimic [[butterfly]]. Camouflage is a form of visual deception; the term probably comes from  ''camouflet'', a [[French Language|French]] term meaning ''smoke blown in someone's face as a practical joke''.<ref name=camouflet>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=camouflet |title=Definition of camouflet}}</ref> [[Military camouflage]] is part of a broad area of deception and concealment from all means of detection including sound and radar, and involving non-camouflage techniques such as use of decoys and electronic jamming.<ref name=fm5-20>{{cite book |url=http://cartome.org/fm5-20-toc.htm |title=FM 5-20, CAMOUFLAGE |author=U.

According to [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]] such as camouflage that help an animal to survive will tend to evolve in any population.<ref name=darwinoos/>

Camouflage, whether in animals or in military use, can be achieved in different ways, including the apparent opposites [[#Camouflage by mimesis|mimesis]]<U+2014>being seen, but resembling something else, and [[#Camouflage by crypsis|crypsis]]<U+2014>being hidden.<ref name=Forbes>Forbes, P. 2009 p. 50-51</ref> In both cases, however, camouflage is achieved not by actual invisibility, but by not being noticed. A third approach, [[#Dazzle patterning|dazzle]], found military application in the 20th century. 

Camouflage is not the only form of [[animal coloration]] that helps animals to survive. Other [[adaptations]] include [[Aposematism|warning coloration]], non-concealing forms of [[mimicry]] (as when a harmless hoverfly resembles a stinging wasp), the use of bright colours in [[sexual selection]], and the use of [[Biological pigment|pigment]] in the skin to protect against sunburn.

==History==
[[Image:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|upright|75px|left|Charles Darwin (1809-1882)]]
[[Image:E. B. Poulton.JPG|thumb|upright|75px|Edward Poulton (1856-1943)]]

Camouflage has been a topic of interest and [[research]] in [[biology]] for well over a century. According to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[natural selection]],<ref name=darwinoos>Darwin, C. 1859</ref> features such as camouflage [[evolution|evolved]] by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage, enabling them to leave more offspring, on average, than other members of the same [[species]]. In his ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Darwin wrote:<ref>Darwin, C. 1859, chapter 4.</ref>

:''"When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey, so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant."''

In the 19th century, [[Poulton, E. B.|Edward Bagnall Poulton]] studied [[animal coloration]], especially camouflage, classifying different types such as "special protective resemblance" (where an animal looks like another object), or "general aggressive resemblance" (where a predator blends in with the background, enabling it to approach prey).<ref>Poulton, E.B. ''The Colours of Animals: their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects''. London, 1890.</ref>

The artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] formulated "Thayer's Law", the principle of countershading.<ref>Thayer, A.H. ''Concealing Colouration in the Animal Kingdom''. New York, 1909.</ref>

In the 20th century, [[Cott, H. B.|Hugh Cott]] worked to persuade the British army to use more effective camouflage techniques, including countershading. For example, he painted two rail-mounted coastal guns, one in conventional style, one countershaded. In aerial photographs, the countershaded gun is essentially invisible.<ref>Forbes 2009, pages 149-150.</ref> His 1940 book ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' introduced ideas such as "maximum disruptive contrast" (see illustration), in which streaks of boldly contrasting colour paradoxically help to make an animal or military vehicle less visible by breaking up its outline.<ref>Cott, H.B. ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals''. Methuen, London, 1940.</ref>

== Camouflage by mimesis ==
{{further2|[[Mimicry]]}}

In [[Mimesis (biology)|mimesis]] (also called ''masquerade''), the whole animal (or piece of military equipment) looks like some other object, which is of no special interest to the observing animal or enemy.<ref name="Gullan">{{cite book | title=The Insects | publisher=John Wiley, Blackwell | author=Gullan, PJ and PS Cranston | year=4th Edition, 2010 | isbn=978-1444330366 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S7yGZasJ7nEC&pg=PA512#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|512,513}} Mimesis is common in [[prey]] animals, for example when a [[Peppered Moth]] caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf.<ref name=Forbes />{{rp|151}}

Mimesis is also employed by some [[predation|predators]] (or [[parasite]]s) to lure their prey, for example, a [[flower mantis]] mimics a particular kind of flower, such as an [[orchid]].<ref name=Forbes />{{rp|134}} Such aggressive mimesis has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with [[Q-ship]]s disguised as merchant ships but in fact heavily armed.<ref name="Beyer">Beyer, Kenneth M.: ''Q-Ships versus U-Boats. America's Secret Project''. Naval Institute Press. Annapolis, Maryland, USA. 1999.

As an example of mimesis, consider the [[Common Cuckoo]], which is a [[brood parasite]]: the female lays her eggs in nests of other species of bird, always smaller than the cuckoo, one per nest. The female mimics a [[Eurasian Sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawk]]; since small birds then take action to avoid the apparent predator, she then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1093/beheco/arr008|last= Welbergen |first= J. |coauthors= Davies, N.B. |year=2011 |title= A parasite in wolf's clothing: hawk mimicry reduces mobbing of cuckoos by hosts|journal= Behavioral Ecology |volume= 22|issue=3|pages=574<U+2013>579}}</ref> The egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.<ref>{{cite news | title = Cuckoo in egg pattern 'arms race' | author= Emma Brennand | publisher = [[BBC News]] | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9418000/9418131.stm | accessdate = 22 August 2011 | date=24 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="ibis2002">{{cite journal|last= Mosk<U+00E1>t |first= C. |coauthors= Honza, M.|year=2002|title= European Cuckoo Cuculus canorus parasitism and host's rejection behaviour in a heavily parasitized Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus population|journal= Ibis|doi=10.1046/j.1474-919X.2002.00085.x|volume= 144|issue=4|pages=614<U+2013>622}}</ref>

A different, non-camouflage strategy is [[mimicry]], where an animal boldly resembles another animal, typically one that is poisonous or distasteful: it is then easily seen, but avoided.<ref name=Forbes />{{rp|6-42}}

== Camouflage by crypsis ==
{{see also|Crypsis}}

Crypsis means blending with the background, making the animal (or military equipment) hard to see (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent: for details, see [[Crypsis]]). Camouflage - visual crypsis - can be achieved in many different ways, including:<ref name=Forbes /> 

* General resemblance to background
* Disruptive patterning (breaking up outline)
* Eliminating shadow
* Crypsis by behavior
* Crypsis by changing skin pattern, colour
* Countershading
* Counterillumination

These ways of achieving crypsis are described below.

===General resemblance to background===

Some animals' colours and patterns resemble a particular natural background, for example the [[Peppered Moth]] adult blends in with tree bark.<ref>{{cite book | title=Collins Wild Guide: Butterflies and Moths | publisher=HarperCollins | author=Still, J. | year=1996 | pages=158 | isbn=978 0 00 2200104}}</ref>

===Disruptive patterning===

Some animals, whether predators like the [[Leopard]] or potential prey like the [[Egyptian Nightjar]], have disruptive patterns that break up their outlines with strongly-contrasting markings.<ref name=Disruptive>{{cite journal | title=Disruptive contrast in animal camouflage | author=Stevens, M.; Cuthill, I.C.; Windsor, A.M.M.; Walker, H.J. | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | year=2006 | month=October 7 | volume=273 | issue=1600 | pages=2433<U+2013>2436 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3614 | pmc=1634902 | pmid=16959632}}</ref> Disruptive patterns "are characterized by high-contrast light and dark patches, in a nonrepetitive configuration, that also provide camouflage by disrupting the recognizable shape or orientation of the animal".<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.mbl.edu/mrc/hanlon/pdfs/barbosa_et_al_vis08.pdf | title=Cuttlefish camouflage: The effects of substrate contrast and size in evoking uniform, mottle or disruptive body patterns | author=Barbosa, A., Mathger, L.M., Buresch, K.C., Kelly, J., Chubb, C., Chiao, C., Hanlon R.T. | journal=Vision Research | year=2008 | volume=48 | pages=1242<U+2013>1253}}</ref>

{{further2|[[List of camouflage patterns]]|[[Disruptive pattern material]]|[[Military camouflage]]}}

Disruptive patterning is now common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by other factors including shape, shine, and shadow.<ref name="Sweet">{{cite book | title=Transportation and Cargo Security: Threats and Solutions | publisher=Prentice Hall | author=Sweet, K.M. | year=2006 | pages=219}}</ref>

===Eliminating shadow===
Some animals, such as the Horned Lizards of North America, have evolved elaborate measures to eliminate [[shadow]]. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which "break up and camouflage any dark shadow line that might fall along the body's edge."<ref name="Sherbrooke">{{cite book | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press | author=Sherbrooke, W.C. | year=2003 | pages=117<U+2013>8 | isbn=978-0520228252 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zXlLdu3956gC&pg=PA118&lpg}}</ref> The theory that the body shape of the Horned Lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimize shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the [[Roundtail Horned Lizard]], which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. "When threatened, it enhances this resemblance by hunching up its back, an act that displays rather than hides its three-dimensionality."<ref name="Sherbrooke"/>

"Elimination of shadow" was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.<ref name="TTT">{{cite journal | url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt09/camouflage.html | title=Principles of Camouflage | author=(U.S. War Department) | journal=Tactical and Technical Trends | year=1943 | month=November 4 | issue=37}}</ref>

===Crypsis by behaviour===

====Decoration, keeping still, lying flat====
Some animals actively seek to make themselves cryptic by using materials from their environment, such as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal their outlines, for example when a [[Caddis Fly]] larva builds a decorated case, or when a [[Decorator Crab]] covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.<ref name=Forbes/> Most other forms of crypsis also require some animal behaviour, e.g., keeping still, lying flat, as in the [[Flat-tail Horned Lizard]],<ref name="HLCS">{{cite web | url=http://www.hornedlizards.org/hornedlizards/hornedlizards_frame.html | title=Horned Lizard Conservation Society | publisher=hornedlizards.org | work=What is a Horned Lizard? | accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> or swaying as if rippled by wind or water currents, as in the [[Leafy Sea Dragon]].<ref name="WWF">{{cite web | url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/teacher_resources/best_place_species/current_top_10/leafy_sea_dragon.cfm | title=Leafy Sea Dragon | publisher=WWF | work=The fish that looks like a plant | accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>

Similar principles can be applied for military purposes, for example when a [[sniper]] wears a [[ghillie suit]] designed to be further camouflaged by decoration with materials such as tufts of grass from the sniper's immediate environment.

</gallery></center>

====Motion camouflage====
Most forms of camouflage break down when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily seen by the observing predator, prey or enemy.<ref>Cott, H.B. 1940. pages 141-143.</ref> However some insects such as [[hoverflies]]<ref name="Srinivasan and Davey">{{cite journal | title=Strategies for active camouflage of motion |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/259/1354/19.short | author=Srinivasan, M.V., Davey, M. | journal=Proc.

===Crypsis by changing skin pattern, colour===
{{further|Animal coloration|:Category:Animals that can change color}}

Animals such as [[chameleon]], flatfish, squid or [[octopus]] actively and rapidly change their skin patterns and colours using special [[chromatophore]] cells to resemble their current background (as well as for signalling).<ref name=Forbes /><ref name="Wallin">{{cite web | url=http://www.bioscience-explained.org/ENvol1_2/pdf/paletteEN.pdf | title=Nature's Palette | publisher=Bioscience-explained.org | work=Nature's Palette: How animals, including humans, produce colours | year=2002 | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | author=Wallin, M. | pages=Vol 1, No 2, pages 1<U+2013>12}}</ref> 

On a longer timescale, some animals like the [[Arctic Hare]], [[Arctic Fox]], [[Stoat]] (also called E rmine), and [[Rock Ptarmigan|Ptarmigan]] change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey in the summer to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family ([[Canidae]]) to do so.<ref name="Churchill">{{cite web | url=http://churchillpolarbears.org/churchill/arctic-wildlife | title=Arctic Wildlife | publisher=Churchill Polar Bears | work=Arctic Wildlife | year=2011 | accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref> However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of [[Canada]], where summer is very short, remain white all year round.<ref name="Churchill"/><ref name="ParksCanada">{{cite web | url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/canada/pn-tfn/itm2-/2007/2007-01-29_e.asp | title=A hare of a different color | publisher=Parks Canada | work=How Arctic Hares have adapted to Gros Morne National Park of Canada | date=January 29, 2007 | accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref>

Again, similar principles can be applied for military purposes. ''[[Active camouflage]]'' could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simpler techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since the [[Second World War]].

</gallery></center>

===Crypsis by countershading===
{{main|Countershading}}

Countershading uses graded colour to create the illusion of flatness. Shadow makes an animal darker below than on top; countershading 'paints in' tones which are darkest on top, lightest below, making the countershaded animal nearly invisible against a matching background.<ref name=cott>Cott, H.B. 1940</ref>  American artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] observed that "Animals are painted by Nature, darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and ''vice versa''". Accordingly the principle of countershading is sometimes called ''Thayer's Law''.<ref name=forbesthayer>Forbes, P. 2009 p. 72-3</ref> 

Countershading is widely used by both terrestrial and marine animals. Examples include [[antelope]]s such as [[gazelle]]s, and [[shark]]s.

Countershading is relatively seldom used for military camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that demonstrated its effectiveness. [[English people|English]] [[Zoologist]] [[Hugh B. Cott]] encouraged the use of techniques including countershading to provide effective concealment, observing that soldiers viewed camouflage netting as "some kind of invisibility cloak: just throw it over the truck and now you don't see it", as Peter Forbes comments.<ref>Forbes, P. 2009, page 152.</ref> At the same time in [[Australia]], zoologist [[William John Dakin]] advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.<ref>Elias, A.,{{cite web|url=http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781920899738|title='Camouflage Australia: Art, Nature, Science and War'}}(Sydney: {{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/sup/|title=Sydney University Press}}, 2011), pp. 57-66.</ref>

</gallery></center>

===Crypsis by counterillumination===
{{main|Counter-illumination}}

Counterillumination means producing light to match the background, notably in some species of [[squid]], such as the [[Sparkling Enope Squid]] (''Watasenia scintillans'') and the Midwater Squid (''Abralia veranyi''). ''Abralia'' has light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.<ref name="Abralia with photo">{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History | work=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi (with photograph) | accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

Counterillumination is the likely function of the [[bioluminescence]] of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract prey and for signalling.

Counterillumination has rarely been used for military purposes. [[Diffused lighting camouflage]], in which light was projected on to the sides of ships to match the faint glow of the night sky, was trialled by Canada's National Research Council during World War II. The Canadian concept was trialled in American aircraft including [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]], using forward-pointing lamps automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the sky.<ref name="NavalMuseumQuebec">{{cite web | url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/10/10-n_eng.asp?category=183&title=1587 | title=Naval Museum of Quebec | publisher=Royal Canadian Navy | work=Diffused Lighting and its use in the Chaleur Bay | accessdate=January 19, 2012}}</ref>

== Dazzle patterning ==
{{further2|[[Military camouflage]]|[[Dazzle camouflage]]|[[Ship camouflage]]}}

Most forms of camouflage are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one form of 'camouflage' works only when in motion: dazzle patterning.<ref name="Scott-Samuel" />

=== Military dazzle 'camouflage' ===
[[Dazzle camouflage|Dazzle patterning]] superficially resembles disruptive patterning, but has a different purpose. It was used on ships during the First World War, not to make vessels hard to see, but to make their speed, size, range and direction difficult to ascertain by eye.<ref name="Behrens Dazzle" /> Dazzle patterning is therefore arguably (by definition) not camouflage, though it has been called camouflage since the First World War.<ref name="Behrens Dazzle" /><ref name="Stevens Motion Dazzle" /> Non-aligning dazzle patterns may have helped to confuse gunners using optical rangefinders, where two halves of the image had to be aligned by eye to estimate the range to the target ship. However the evidence for its success in naval warfare is mixed.<ref name="Behrens Dazzle">Behrens, Roy R. ''False Colors: Art, Design, and Modern Camouflage''. Bobolink Books, 2003.</ref> Remarkably, some United States Navy camouflage schemes in [[World War II]] attempted to combine disruptive camouflage and dazzle.<ref name="Sumrall">Sumrall, R.F. "Ship Camouflage (WWII): Deceptive Art" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' February 1973 pp.67<U+2013>81</ref>

=== Motion dazzle ===
Motion dazzle is caused by rapidly-moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes, as when [[zebra]]s run from a lion. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape.<ref name="Stevens Motion Dazzle">{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/81/abstract | title=BMC Biology: Motion dazzle | publisher=BMC Biology | pages=9:81 | doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81 | work=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=November 27, 2011 | author=Stevens, M., Searle, W.T.L., Seymour, J.E., Marshall, K.L.A., Ruxton, G.D.}}</ref> Motion dazzle distorts speed perception, and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target).<ref name="Scott-Samuel">{{cite journal | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020233 | title=Dazzle Camouflage Affects Speed Perception | author=Scott-Samuel, N.E., Baddeley, R.; Palmer, C.E., Cuthill, I.C. | journal=PLoS ONE | year=2011 | month=June | volume=6 | issue=6 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020233}}</ref> Since dazzle patterns (such as a zebra's stripes) make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and crypsis.<ref name="Stevens Motion Dazzle" />
