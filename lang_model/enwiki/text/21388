'''Elsie Jeanette Dunkerley''' ([[25 November]], [[1880]] - [[9 January]], [[1960]]), was an [[United Kingdom|English]] girls<U+2019> story writer, who took the name '''Oxenham''' as her pseudonym when her first book, [[Oxenham Non-Connectors#The Scottish Sequence|''Goblin Island'']], was published in 1907. Her [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Series]] of 38 titles are probably her best-known books. In her lifetime she had 87 titles published and another two have been published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts in the early 1990s. Oxenham<U+2019>s books are widely collected and there are several Appreciation Societies; in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
==Short Biography==
'''Elsie Jeanette Dunkerley''' was born in [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]], in November 1880, but before she was 2 years old she was taken to [[Ealing]], West [[London]], where she and her sisters went to private schools and attended Ealing [[Congregational Church]]. The six Dunkerley children were: Elsie, Marjory (Maida), Roderic, Theodora (Theo), Erica and Hugo. The family lived in five different houses during their time in Ealing and moved to [[Worthing]], [[Sussex]], in 1922. She took the surname Oxenham as her pen name when [[Oxenham Non-Connectors#The Scottish Sequence|''Goblin Island'']] was published in 1907. Her father, William Arthur Dunkerley, had used the pen-name [[John Oxenham]] for many years prior to this.

During the London years, Elsie Oxenham became involved in the British Section of the [[Camp Fire USA|American Camp Fire]] movement, and qualifed as a Guardian - the leader of a group of Camp Fire Girls. She ran this Camp Fire Group for some 6 years, until the move to Sussex. One of the Camp Fire members was Margaret Bayne Todd - later [[Margaret Simey]] (Lady Simey) - who appears in ''Abbey Girls in Town'' and to whom that title was dedicated. It is thought that she was the 'original' on whom both Jenny-Wren and Littlejan were based.

At some point during her time in London Oxenham joined the English Folk Dance Society (EFDS - it didn't become the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] [EFDSS] until much later). She then discovered how 'badly' she had been doing the dances - and teaching them! - as related in ''The Abbey Girls Go Back to School'' (published 1922). Everything that the 'Writing Person' [her on-page persona] told Maidlin, Jen and Joy, in ''The New Abbey Girls'' (published 1923), about dancing, Grey Edward, and the Camp Fire had happened as described.

After the family had moved to Worthing, Oxenham taught folk dancing in nearby villages and schools. She tried to start another Camp Fire but that wasn't a success as most of the girls of the right age were already [[Girl Guides]].

At first, the family all lived at Farncombe Road, Worthing, but after their mother died the four sisters moved out, living in pairs, Elsie with Maida, and Erica with Theo. None of the sisters married, but both brothers did. Elsie died in a nursing Home in January 1960, a few days after Erica.<ref>biographical information, taken with permission, from Monica Godfrey's short biographical piece on the [http://www.bufobooks.demon.co.uk/html/faq6.html ''Abbey Chronicle'' website]</ref>

==The Author and her books==
Oxenham is best known for her [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Series]] of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main characters from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The '''Hamlet Club''', formed in the first book in the series [[Abbey Girls#Main Abbey Series, (indicating best reading order)|''Girls of the Hamlet Club'']], was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club<U+2019>s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the [[Whiteleaf|Whiteleaf Cross]]. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'', is taken to mean to make the right choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises.<ref>''Girls of the Hamlet Club'' (1914), pp. 163-4.</ref> Throughout the [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Series]] the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a local landmark, is also symbolic, as is any cross, of sacrifice.<ref> ''op cit'', p.166.</ref>

'''The Abbey''' of the series is almost a character in itself. Based on [[Cleeve Abbey]] in [[Somerset]], it first appears as a romantic ruin in the second of the series  [[Abbey Girls#Main Abbey Series (indicating best reading order)|''The Abbey Girls'']]. By the end of this book, the cousins Joan and Joy are living in Abinger Hall, in the gardens of which the Abbey is situated. Joy has been discovered to be the granddaughter of the late owner, Sir Antony Abinger, and the Hall is left to her, but Joan, who was not related to Sir Antony, has been left the Abbey "Because of [her] love for it, and because [her] knowledge of it was so thorough."<ref>''The Abbey Girls'' (1920), p. 317.</ref> The Abbey and its influence pervades the whole series. Characters try to live up to the precepts of the early [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monks who lived there, and even when facing difficult situations abroad, find that the Abbey ethos helps them find the way through to the right decision.<ref>''Biddy<U+2019>s Secret'' (1932), p. 132-3</ref>

Oxenham depicted herself directly and indirectly in several places within the [[Abbey Girls|Abbey series]]. As "The Writing Person" she is obviously herself as she was in the early 1920s, over 40 years of age and going to the folk dance classes run by the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]] in [[London]].<ref>''The New Abbey Girls'' (1923), pp. 227ff; and ''The Abbey Girls Again'' (1924), p. 97.</ref> Once Mary-Dorothy Devine, first introduced in ''The Abbey Girls Again'', becomes a writer, statements she makes about the writing experience must logically be those of Oxenham herself. She talks of "finding" the books, and of "listening in to [her own] private wireless".<ref>''The Abbey Girls in Town'' (1925), p. 163.</ref> Some fifteen years later according to the internal chronology of the series, and nearly thirty years later in real time, Mary-Dorothy advises Rachel Ellerton, a younger writer who has been trying to get her adult fiction published, to try writing for children: <blockquote>...my books are for girls, not for grown-ups, but I've felt it worth while to write them ... I<U+2019>ve never dared to think I could help grown-ups; I doubt if I could even amuse or interest them. But it has seemed worth while to try to influence girls and children for good, by amusing them and catching their interest. Girls are the grown-ups of the future. They may keep something of what is put into them while they are fresh and receptive. I've believed it was more worth while to write for them than to try to write novels.<ref>''A Dancer from the Abbey'' (1953), p. 196.</ref></blockquote> This statement, from near the end of Oxenham's writing career, seems to convey Oxenham<U+2019>s own writing credo. It is quoted in its entirety as one of the few insights Oxenham gives into her own reasons for writing. In her very first book, [[Oxenham Non-Connectors#The Scottish Sequence|''Goblin Island'']], published nearly fifty years earlier, and written in the first person, Jean, the narrator, says, <blockquote>Being an author<U+2019>s daughter, of course I tried to write stories too. I knew all about father's books and helped with many of them, and I always longed to write a book of my own. When I met the Colquhouns I was writing a novel, but it was a secret even from father, for I was very shy about it. But before long my interest in the children ... grew so strong that I left the novel alone. I watched the story of Peggy Colquhoun and Somebody Else to the very end, and it seemed to me that instead of trying to write a novel I might make a story out of the things I had seen really happening.<ref>''Goblin Island'' (1907), p. 7.</ref></blockquote> This would indicate that her own start in writing was similar; it is certainly known that she typed up the writings of her father, [[John Oxenham]], a task later taken on by her sister Erica Dunkerley.

Oxenham's religious background was in [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]]. This gave a [[Protestant]] ethos to her writing and her expressed opinions. Many of her characters go through difficult periods in their lives, and their religious beliefs help them through. Several of the books written in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly, include discussions between characters as to the meaning of life and the reasons behind events.<ref>for example, in ''Abbey Girls at Home'' (1929), pp. 54-5.</ref> These in-depth conversations tend to appear less frequently in the later books, but even as late as 1948, in ''A Fiddler for the Abbey'' Mary-Dorothy Devine, who has become "advisor-in-chief to the clan" <ref>''Robins in the Abbey'' (1947), p. 226. </ref> talks to Rosalind Kane about the biblical concept of "rain falling on the just and the unjust".<ref> ''A Fiddler for the Abbey'' (1948), pp 106-7.</ref>

Folk dancing is a strong influence in many of the books. From ''Girls of the Hamlet Club'' (1914) and ''At School with the Roundheads'' (1915) until ''The Girls of the Abbey School'' (1921), it was seen as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of ''The Abbey Girls Go Back to School'' (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself has come into contact with the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|English Folk Dance Society]] and realising that the dances are not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next seven years or so, until ''Abbey Girls At Home'' (1929) depict members of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|EFDS]] hierarchy with affection and almost reverence.<ref>see, for instance, the depiction of 'The Pixie' as a wise, all-knowing counsellor in ''Abbey Girls in Town'' (1925), pp. 145-9.</ref> It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in ''An Abbey Champion'' (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to [[Worthing]] and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Daking) objected to the way they were being portrayed.<ref> articles by Hilary Clare for ''The Abbey Chronicle'' revised for the Abbey Chronicle web archive on [http://www.bufobooks.demon.co.uk/html/madam.html 'Madam'] and  [http://www.bufobooks.demon.co.uk/html/pixie.html 'The Pixie']</ref>

[[Camp Fire USA|Camp Fire]] plays a large part in several of Oxenham<U+2019>s books published between 1917 and 1940. Oxenham was a Camp Fire Guardian when she lived in [[Ealing]], but the attempt to form a group in [[Sussex]] failed. The Camp Fire ideals of Work, Health and Love <U+2013> 'Wohelo' <U+2013> and the training for young girls in household tasks and cookery it provided, were integral to Oxenham's own philosophy, and underlie the plots of several books. From the Camp Fire as an integral part of a school in [[Abbey Connectors#Woody Dean Set|''A School Camp Fire'']] (1917) and [[Abbey Connectors#Camp Keema Series|''The Crisis in Camp Keema'']] (1928) to the lone Camp Fire Girl, Barbara Holt, in [[Abbey Connectors#Sussex Set|''The Junior Captain'']] (1923) and Maidlin becoming a Torchbearer in ''Maidlin Bears the Torch'' (1937), Camp Fire is always shown as a way of developing character. As Oxenham became less involved with the organisation, and came more into contact with the [[Girlguiding UK|Girl Guides]], the contrast between the two organisations and their aims are shown,<ref>for instance, in ''Peggy and the Brotherhood'' (1936), where the whole plot turns on this contrast.</ref> and eventually the reality of the changed situation in England at the time meant that Guides were more often mentioned than Camp Fire.

==Elsie J. Oxenham's Place in Children's Literature==
Elsie J. Oxenham is considered - among collectors of British Girls' Fiction - as one of the 'Big Three'; the other two being [[Elinor Brent-Dyer]] and [[Dorita Fairlie Bruce]]. Although [[Angela Brazil]] is perhaps the first name to come to mind for non-specialists, in terms of collecting and interest Brazil is less popular than these three. 

Oxenham is also the most prolific of these three,<ref>{{cite book

Nearly forty of her books comprise the main [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Series]], with another thirty or so in several [[Abbey Connectors|connecting series]] and [[Oxenham Non-Connectors|the remaining twenty]] - some in small series of their own, and some isolated titles - having no connection with the [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Books]] at all. During the 1920s to the 1950s she had several short stories, and some longer serialised ones, published in [[List of early 20th-century British children's magazines and annuals|Annuals]] such as the [[British Girl's Annual]], [[Little Folks]] and [[Hulton's Girls' Stories]]. Some of these were connected to the books - i.e. dealt with characters from one of her books or series - others became books, or sections of books, that were published a year or two later.

==Reprints of Oxenham's Books==
[[HarperCollins|Collins]] reprinted most of the Oxenham titles they published quite frequently, in particular the main titles in the [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Series]]. Her other publishers were less likely to do so, though a few titles had one or two reissues. This is why the non-Collins books are normally rarer - and consequently more expensive for the collector.  

Several of Oxenham's books have been recently reprinted by [http://www.ggbp.co.uk|'''Girls Gone By Publishers'''], who are planning to republish the main [[Abbey Girls|Abbey Series]]. 2007 is the centenary year of Elsie Oxenham's first book [[Oxenham Non-Connectors#The Scottish Sequence|''Goblin Island'']] which is due to be republished later this year by [http://www.ggbp.co.uk|'''GGBP''']. 

''Goblin Island'' became the first in the so-called [[Oxenham Non-Connectors#The Scottish Sequence|Scottish Sequence]] of six titles, four of which are set largely in [[Scotland]], ''Goblin Island'' itself, set on 'Loch Avie', a fictionalised [[Loch Lomond]]; ''Princess in Tatters'', set on 'Loch Ruel'; ''A Holiday Queen'', set at 'Morven' on what appears to be [[Loch Long]]; and ''Schoolgirls and Scouts'' set at 'Glenleny', which also seems to be on [[Loch Long]], but a bit further up the loch. Of the other two in the series, ''Twins of Castle Charming'' - perhaps Oxenham's rarest title - is set largely in [[Switzerland]], whereas ''Finding Her Family'' has some early scenes set in [[Ealing]] and largely takes place in [[Saltburn]].

==Appreciation Societies==
===The Elsie Jeanette Oxenham Appreciation Society (UK)===
The UK EJO Society was founded in 1989 as a "postal meeting place" for all who collect the books of Elsie J. Oxenham and are interested in her work. Its magazine [http://www.bufobooks.demon.co.uk/abbeylnk.htm ''The Abbey Chronicle''] is published three times a year and contains articles about the author, her books, the real places used as settings for the books, the originals of characters within the books, and reports of meetings held by members. 
One of the interests of collectors and EJO Society members is finding and visiting the original sites used by Oxenham in her books. As well as the [[Buckinghamshire]]/[[Oxfordshire]] area which is the background for ''Girls of the Hamlet Club'' and the village of [[Washford]], Somerset where [[Cleeve Abbey]] is situated, Oxenham used parts of [[Sussex]], [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], the [[English Lake District]] and [[Scotland]] for the settings of several books. The UK Society holds a biennial meeting at [[Cleeve Abbey]] in the summer, which includes folk-dancing and tours of the Abbey as if it were the fictional one. Naturally these places are not always depicted in the books exactly as the real sites; Oxenham was writing fiction, and given that she could move an abbey several hundred miles for her purposes, changing a few names and telescoping or stretching distances was also well within her remit.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] there has been a society since 1985,  [http://www.nswabbeygirls.com|'''The Abbey Girls of Australia'''] which has a magazine, ''The Abbey Guardian''. It has official branches in several states of Australia. They hold regular meetings, and arrange weekend 'Camps' every two or three years where they can meet people form further afield. They also hold [[May Queen]] coronations and their motto is 'Bound in Friendship'.
===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand|New Zealand's]] Society was founded at about the same time as the British one, and its magazine is called ''The Abbey Gatehouse''. At the moment there is no web page available for the New Zealand Society.
===Rest of the World=== 
[[South Africa]] and [[North America]] both have groups who meet regularly, but they do not produce their own magazines. Members of the groups receive the magazines which do exist, normally each subscribing to one of the three, as well as magazines for other author interest societies, as a means of sharing them among the rest of the group.
==The EJO Seat at Cleeve Abbey==
In 1995 the EJO Societies worldwide held a collection to provide a seat at [[Cleeve Abbey]] as a recognition of the inspiration that the author received by her visits to the Abbey, and her collection of photographs of the site. In summer it is usually placed against the outer wall of the west range to overlook the gatehouse meadow.  

The plaque on the seat reads:
