'''Swarthmore College''' is a [[Private school|private]] [[liberal arts college]] in the [[United States]] with an enrollment of about 1450 students. The college is located in the borough of [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania|Swarthmore]], [[Pennsylvania]], 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. 

The school was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of the [[Philadelphia Yearly Meeting]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]]. Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in the early 20th century. The college has been [[coeducation]]al since its founding.

"Swarthmore" can be pronounced with the first "r" either vocalized or dropped due to differences in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents]]. 

Swarthmore's campus is home to the [[Scott Arboretum]].

==History==
The name "Swarthmore" has its roots in early Quaker history. In [[England]], [[Swarthmoor Hall]] in [[Cumbria]] was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when [[George Fox]], fresh from his epiphany atop [[Pendle Hill]] in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margeret Fell and the inhabitants of the nearby village of Fenmore of Friendly, and Swarthmoor was used for the first Friends' meetings.

The school was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends.  A more detailed history of Swarthmore can be found [http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/index_intro.html here].

[[Solomon Asch]] and [[Wolfgang K<U+00F6>hler]] were two noted psychologists who were professors at Swarthmore. Asch joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, while K<U+00F6>hler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. The [[Asch conformity experiments]] took place at Swarthmore.

In its most recent [[College and university rankings|college ranking]], ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Swarthmore as the number-three liberal arts college, with an overall score of 98/100, behind [[Williams College|Williams]] and [[Amherst College|Amherst]], respectively. Swarthmore is regularly cited as one of the "[[Little Ivies]]." Swarthmore's endowment (at the end of FY2005) was about $1.169 billion, ranking 45th amongst all institutions of higher education in the United States.  Endowment per student is $766,500, 12th in the U.S. ({{cite web | title="The Rich Get Richer" | work=Inside Higher Ed | url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/01/23/nacubo | accessdate=2006-06-25}}).
  
The school is particularly notable for its [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[tutorial]]-inspired Honors Program, which allows students to take intense, double-credit seminars from their junior year and often write extensive honors [[Thesis|theses]]. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students.  Students in seminars will usually write at least three ten-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20-30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their senior year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Around one student in each discipline is awarded "Highest Honors"; others are either awarded "High Honors" or "Honors"; rarely, a student is denied any Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admittance to the Honors program.

Unusual for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an [[engineering]] program; at the end of four years, students are granted a B.S. in Engineering. Other notable programs include  minors in [[peace and conflict studies]], [[cognitive science]], and [[critical theory|interpretation theory]].

Swarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium (or TriCo) with nearby [[Bryn Mawr College]] and [[Haverford College]], which allows students from any of the three to cross-register for courses at any of the others. The consortium as a whole is additionally affiliated with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and students are able to cross-register for courses there as well.

Though students and faculty tout the College's relative lack of grade inflation,[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/1999/1999-09-17/news/grades.html] Swarthmore's average undergraduate GPA increased from 2.83 in 1973 to 3.24 in 1997[http://gradeinflation.com/swarthmore.html].  Swarthmore argues that the methodology overstates the change [http://www.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/archive/99/june99/letters.html].

Since the 1970's, Swarthmore students have won 135 [[Fulbright Scholarships]], 25 [[Rhodes Scholarships]], 8 [[Marshall Scholarships]], 13 [[Luce Scholarships]], 68 [[Watson Fellowships]], 21 [[Truman Scholarships]], and 1 [[Mitchell Scholarship]].

==Tuition and Finances==
The total cost of tuition, fees, room, and board for a student entering in the fall of 2005 was $41,280 (tuition and fees were together $31,516).

As previously mentioned, Swarthmore is currently ranked third among all liberal arts colleges (as determined by the infamous'' US News & World Report'' Annual Rankings).  Since the inception of the rankings, Swarthmore has consistently ranked first, second, or third in what has become a predictable rotation among Williams, Amherst, and Swarthmore, schools sometimes referred to as "[[Little Ivies]]." Swarthmore's endowment at the end of FY2005 was approximately $1.169 billion, ranking 45th amongst all institutions of higher education in the United States, and fifth amongst liberal arts colleges.  Endowment per student was $766,500 for 2004-2005, 12th in the U.S. amongst all institutions of higher education and ahead of both Amherst and Williams. ({{cite web | title="The Rich Get Richer" | work=Inside Higher Ed | url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/01/23/nacubo | accessdate=2006-06-25}}).

Operating revenue for the 2004-2005 school year was $104,489,000, over 42% of which was provided by the endowment.  As is the case with most every elite institution of higher education, actual costs as measured on a per-student basis far exceed revenue from tuition and fees, and so Swarthmore's endowment serves to offset ever-rising costs of education, subsidizing every student's education at Swarthmore--even those paying full tuition.  For the 2005-2006 year, tuition, fees, and room & board charges ($41,280) fell well short of the actual cost of education per student, which was approximately $70,300.

Swarthmore is currently engaged in a $230 million capital campaign, christened "The Meaning of Swarthmore" and underway officially since the fall of 2001.

==Campus==

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Swarthmorescottamp.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Scott Ampitheatre, 2005.]] -->
The campus consists of 357 acres in Swarthmore, Pennslyvania, 11 miles southwest of Philadephia. It is based on a north-south axis anchored by [[Parrish Hall]], which houses the office of admissions, the dean, and the registrar, as well as two floors of student housing. The [[campus radio]] station [[WSRN-FM]] broadcasts from the top.

From the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] [[Swarthmore (SEPTA station)|Swarthmore commuter train station]] and the ville of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is also coterminous with the Scott Arboretum, cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.

The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as is the quaint Woolman dormitory. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms of Willets, Mertz, Worth, and Alice Paul. To the west are the dorms of Wharton, Dana, and Hallowell, Sharples dining hall, the Scott Amphitheater, the two non-residential fraternities (Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon), the athletic facilities, and the Crum Creek in the sprawling Crum Woods.  Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, while Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/03/dbing/history/]

==Clubs and organizations==
There are more than 100 chartered clubs and organizations at Swarthmore, in addition to many other unchartered groups.  Clubs and organizations are a fundamental part of the College, and the center of many students' energies and social life. This extracurricular involvement contributes to the frequent characterization of Swarthmore students as both motivated and overworked.

===Sports===

Swarthmore offers the full panoply of sporting teams. Varsity teams include [[badminton]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[cross country]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[lacrosse]], [[soccer]], [[softball]], [[swimming]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]] and [[volleyball]]. Notably lacking among these teams is football, which was controversially eliminated in 2000, along with wrestling, largely due to a lack of suitable athletes on campus.[http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003-12-04/news/13551],[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/daily/specials/sportscut/index.html]

===Publications===

The main student newspaper at Swarthmore is ''[[Swarthmore_Phoenix|The Phoenix]]''[http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/], a weekly school-sponsored newspaper published every Thursday, except during exam and vacation time. Some staff positions are paid a token amount. The newspaper was founded in [[1881]], with online editions beginning in [[1995]]. Its current tabloid format is more similar to a newsmagazine than a newspaper, with a color front cover. Two thousand copies, free of charge, are distributed across the college campus and to the [[Swarthmore%2C_Pennsylvania|borough of Swarthmore]]. The newspaper is printed at [[The Delaware County Daily Times]] in Primos, [[Pennsylvania]]. Its online website is hosted by the [[Swarthmore College Computer Society]], with bandwidth-search engine capability provided by the Swarthmore College Information Technology Services. In [[2000]], ''The Phoenix'' was an [[National_Pacemaker_Awards|Online Pacemaker]] for the [[Associated_Collegiate_Press|Associated Collegiate Press]] award.

The Daily Gazette[http://daily.swarthmore.edu/] is another student newspaper; unlike ''The Phoenix'', it is a daily electronic "paper" and is independent of both the administration and student government. Its coverage includes news, arts, and daily sports reporting. The first issues were distributed through e-mail during the fall semester of [[1996]], with an online edition soon following. Currently, the Daily Gazette has 1700 subscribers. The ''Agora'' is another small student newspaper with a liberal, activist outlook, though it is published only sporadically.

There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published biannually at the end of each semester. One is ''Spike'', Swarthmore's humor magazine. The others are literary magazines, including ''Small Craft Warnings'', which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; ''Scarlet Letters'', which publishes women's literature; ''Enie'', for Spanish literature; ''OURstory'', for literature relating to diversity issues; ''Bug-Eyed Magazine'', a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by [[Swarthmore_Warders_of_Imaginative_Literature|SWIL]]; ''Remappings'' (formerly "''CelebrASIAN''"), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; ''Alchemy'', a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; ''Mjumbe'', published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An erotica magazine, ''!'' (pronounced "bang") was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, ''Untouchables''. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages.

===Radio===

WSRN 91.5 FM is the college radio station. It has a mix of [[Indie_%28music%29|indie]], [[Rock_music|rock]], [[Hip_hop_music|hip-hop]], [[Folk_music|folk]] and [[classical music|classical]] music, as well as a number of radio [[talk shows]]. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the "Crisis of '69"[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-01-24/news/11640.html] extensively. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.[http://www.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/archive/97/mar97/folkfestivals.html] Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/] and the effects of [[11 September]] [[2001]] on campus.

===Activism===

Swarthmore is also known as a center of social and political activism. The college has recently received significant coverage due to two student groups founded in [[2004]], the [[Genocide Intervention Network]] (now an independent non-student group) and [[War News Radio]]. Swarthmore's political landscape is generally considered fairly left-wing, though student activism is far less a part of student culture than at other schools, or in the heyday of protest culture in the 1960s, a period of activism that prompted former vice-president Spiro Agnew to label the College the "Kremlin on the Crum." Recent high-profile campaigns included a living wage organization (Swarthmore Living Wage & Democracy Campaign), actions surrounding the [[electronic voting]] machine manufacturer [[Diebold]] by campus groups [[Free_Culture_Movement|Freeculture.org]] and [[Why War?]], and a "Kick Coke" campaign aimed at replacing soda machines offering [[Coca-Cola]] with alternative products.

==Alumni==
[[Image:kohlberg.jpg|right|thumb|Kohlberg Hall]]
{{main|List of Swarthmore College people}}
Swarthmore's alumni include eight [[MacArthur Foundation]] fellows and four [[Nobel Prize]] winners, most recently [[Edward C. Prescott]], who graduated in 1962. In addition, hundreds of prominent figures in law, art, science, business, politics, and other fields have attended Swarthmore. 

The most famous Swarthmore graduates are probably [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]] (1955), who was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], and novelist [[James A. Michener]] (1929), both of whom graduated with highest honors. Michener left his entire $10 million estate (including the [[copyright]]s to his works) to Swarthmore.

Other prominent alumni include [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]] (1956), astronomer [[Sandra M. Faber]] (1966), ''[[The Corrections]]'' author [[Jonathan Franzen]] (1981), [[Caltech]] president and [[Nobel laureate]] [[David Baltimore]] (1960), and [[Justin Hall]] (1998), widely considered to be the first [[blog]]ger. [[Wall Street]] magnate and [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.]] founder [[Jerome Kohlberg, Jr.]] (1946) founded the [[Philip Evans Scholarship Foundation]] in 1986 at Swarthmore. [[Suffragist]] and [[National Women's Party]] founder [[Alice Paul]] graduated in 1905; students voted to name a newly completed residence hall after her in 2005. [[Astronaut]] [[Sally Ride]], the first American woman in space, attended but later transferred to [[Stanford University]] to major in Physics and English.
