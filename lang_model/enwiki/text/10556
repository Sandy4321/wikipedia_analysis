In 1990, he was elected to the National Union of Students' National Executive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/mps_detail.aspx?name=Tim_Farron_MP&pPK=457a7c9a-0b3e-498e-b050-ecbc86aaed70 |title=Tim Farron MP <U+2013> MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Party President &#124; The Liberal Democrats - Our MPs in Detail |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>
Prior to his election to Parliament, Farron worked in higher education at [[Lancaster University]] from 1992<U+2013>2002 and [[St. Martin's College]], [[Ambleside]], from 2002-5.

== Political career ==
Farron contested the [[North West Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Durham]] constituency at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], where he finished in third place, 20,006 votes behind the sitting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Hilary Armstrong]]. 

Farron served as a [[Councillor]] on [[Lancashire County Council]] from 1993<U+2013>2000, and was also a Councillor on [[South Ribble Borough Council]] from 1995 to 1999.

Farron was selected to contest the Labour/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] marginal constituency of [[South Ribble (UK Parliament constituency)|South Ribble]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], and again finished in third place. He was a Liberal Democrat candidate for the North West region in the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|1999 European Parliament elections]].

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Farron contested the [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] seat and finished second, reducing the majority of the sitting Conservative MP [[Tim Collins (politician)|Tim Collins]] to 3,167. 

Farron served as a Councillor for the [[Milnthorpe]] ward on the [[South Lakeland]] District Council from 2004-8.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], Farron again fought Collins in Westmorland and Lonsdale, and this time won this election by a narrow margin of just 267 votes. He made his [[maiden speech]] in Parliament on 25 May 2005.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050525/debtext/50525-19.htm#50525-19_spnew1 House of Commons Debates for 25th May 2005] - ''[[Hansard]]''</ref>

Farron has been a member of the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Education and Skills]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] since his election, and later in 2005 was appointed as Youth Affairs Spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats. He is the Chair of the All Party group on Hill Farming.

During [[Menzies Campbell]]'s period as the Liberal Democrat leader, Farron was  Campbell's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]]. In 2007 he was given the responsibility as Liberal Democrat spokesman for [[Home Office|Home Affairs]]. 

Farron resigned from the [[front bench]] of the Liberal Democrats on 5 March 2008 in protest at the party's abstention from a parliamentary vote on the EU referendum. However he later returned to the party's front bench as spokesperson for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.<ref>[http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/search/2096143.MP_Tim_Farron_resigns_from_Lib_Dem_frontbench/ MP Tim Farron resigns from Lib Dem frontbench] - ''[[The Westmorland Gazette]]'' 2008-03-05</ref> He is a member of the [[Beveridge Group]] within the Liberal Democrats.<ref>[http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/about-us/about-us.html About us] - ''[[Beveridge Group|The Beveridge Group]]'' 2007-10-28</ref> 

Farron was one of four Liberal Democrat MPs who voted against the [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations|Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070319/debtext/70319-0014.htm#07031932000552 |title=Commons Hansard 19 March 2007 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2007-03-19 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2007-03-19&number=79&mpn=Tim_Farron&mpc=Westmorland_and_Lonsdale&house=commons |title=publicwhip.org voting summary |publisher=Publicwhip.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> On his decision voted this way Farron commented "I voted against two bits of the Equalities Act because I take a rather extreme liberal view on free speech <U+2013> if I remember rightly I took the same stance on the issue as [[Peter Tatchell]] who is not, so far as I am aware, a homophobe" and backing up this, Farron also stated "That<U+2019>s why, for instance, I also voted for the abolition of the blasphemy laws".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/tim-farron-runs-for-deputy-leader-campbell-and-munt-back-him-19695.html |title=Tim Farron runs for deputy leader; Campbell and Munt back him |publisher=Libdemvoice.org |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Farron achieved an 11.1% swing from the Conservatives, winning by a majority of 12,264 in his historically Tory seat. This result was against the run of the rest of the party, making Westmorland and Lonsdale one of the few Lib Dem strongholds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/f13.stm |title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Westmorland & Lonsdale |publisher=BBC News |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=9 Nay 2010}}</ref>

On 27 May 2010, Farron announced he would be standing for the position of Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, made vacant by the resignation of [[Vince Cable]].
On 9 June, Farron lost the competition to the former party President, [[Simon Hughes]]. Hughes won by 20 votes; having had 38 nominations from the parliamentary party, compared to Farron's 18.

On 16 September 2010, Farron announced he would be standing for the position of President of the Liberal Democrats following [[Rosalind Scott, Baroness Scott of Needham Market|The Baroness Scott]]'s decision not to seek re-election. He won the election with 53% of the vote, beating fellow candidate [[Susan Kramer]] on 47%.<ref>{{Cite news| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11750362 | work= BBC News | title= Tim Farron elected as Lib Dem president | accessdate= 2010-11-13 | date=13 November 2010}}</ref>

In March 2012, Farron was one of three MPs who signed a letter sent to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], criticising their recent decision to stop the Christian group "Healing on the Streets of Bath" from making explicit claims that prayer can heal. The letter called for the ASA to provide indisputable scientific evidence that faith healing did not work; Farron subsequently admitted that the letter was not "well-worded" and that he should not have signed it "as it was written".<ref>{{Cite news| url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/29/tim-farron-prayer-can-heal-letter-was-a-mistake_n_1387187.html | work= Huffington Post UK | title= Tim Farron: 'Prayer Can Heal' Letter Was A Mistake  | accessdate= 2012-03-30 | date=29 March 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Farron married Rosemary Cantley in July 2000 in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. The couple live in [[Milnthorpe]], within the constituency Farron represents, with their two sons (born January 2004 and January 2006) and two daughters (including a daughter born in September 2001), the younger son being born since his election to Parliament. He is a church-going [[Anglican]] who describes "becoming a Christian at the age of eighteen as the most massive choice I have made." <ref>Church Times, page 44, 20 May 2011</ref>
