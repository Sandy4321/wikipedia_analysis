'''Pearl Jam''' is an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band that formed in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]] in 1990. The band's original line-up consisted of [[Eddie Vedder]] (lead vocals), [[Jeff Ament]] (bass), [[Stone Gossard]] (rhythm guitar), [[Mike McCready]] (lead guitar), and [[Dave Krusen]] (drums). The band's current drummer is [[Matt Cameron]], formerly of [[Soundgarden]], who has been with the band since 1998.

Formed after the demise of Ament and Gossard's previous band [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. One of the key bands of the [[Grunge music|grunge]] movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was nevertheless criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the [[alternative rock]] explosion. However, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices as their career progressed, including refusing to make [[music videos]] and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame."<ref name="secondcoming">{{citeweb | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming | title = The Second Coming of Pearl Jam | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = [[2006-06-16]] | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation: 1984<U+2013>1990===
Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of pioneering grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]] during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates [[Mark Arm]] and [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little Brown and Company, 2001. ISBN 0-316-78753-1, pg. 422</ref> In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with [[Malfunkshun]] vocalist [[Andrew Wood]], eventually organizing the band [[Mother Love Bone]]. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the [[PolyGram]] record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Their debut album, ''[[Apple (album)|Apple]]'' was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a [[heroin]] [[overdose]].<ref>{{citeweb | last = Friend | first = Lonn M. | url = http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/rip_7-92.shtml | title = Heroes... and Heroin | work = RIP Magazine | year = 1992 | month = July | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}</ref>

Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the accompanying disbanding of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.<ref name="crowe">{{cite web | last = Crowe | first = Cameron | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world | title = Five Against the World | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = [[1993-10-28]] | accessdate = 2007-06-23 }}</ref> After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band Shadow had just broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.<ref name="secondcoming" /> After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.<ref name="crowe" />

Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy, [[San Diego]] singer [[Eddie Vedder]].<ref>Wall, Mick. "Alive". ''Nirvana and the Story of Grunge''. ''Q'' p. 95</ref> Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, [[Bad Radio]], and worked part time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.<ref name="crowe" /> There he recorded the vocals to three of the songs ("[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", "[[Once (song)|Once]]", and "[[Footsteps (Pearl Jam song)|Footsteps]]") in what Vedder would later describe as a "mini-opera".<ref>{{cite web | last = Clay | first = Jennifer | url = http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/rip1291.shtml | month = December | year = 1991 | title = Life After Love Bone | work = RIP Magazine | accessdate = 2007-06-23 }}</ref> He sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were so impressed that they had Vedder fly to Seattle. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.<ref name="crowe" />

With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name [[Mookie Blaylock]], in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band played their first official show at the Off Ramp club in Seattle on [[October 22]], [[1990]],<ref name="timeline">{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ | title=Pearl Jam: Timeline | accessdate=2007-06-27 | publisher=Pearljam.com}}</ref> and soon signed to [[Epic Records]]. However, concerns about trademark issues necessitated a name change; the band's name became "Pearl Jam".<ref name="Erlewine" />

In an early promotional interview Vedder claimed that the name "Pearl Jam" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.<ref name="rhrn">Neely, Kim. "Right Here, Right Now". ''Rolling Stone''. October 31, 1991.</ref> Another theory put forward in Kim Neely's band history ''Five Against One'' holds that one of the band members really wanted "pearl" in the new name, and [[Jam session|jamming]] is a common activity done by musicians.<ref>Neely, Kim. ''Five Against One''. Diane Publishing Company, 1999. ISBN 0-7567-7409-8</ref> In a 2006 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover story Ament and McCready admitted that Ament came up with "Pearl", and that "Jam" was added after the band saw [[Neil Young]] live.<ref name="secondcoming" />

===''Ten'' and the grunge explosion: 1991<U+2013>1992===
Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''.<ref name="blackdays">Pearlman, Nina. "Black Days". ''Guitar World''. December 2002.</ref> Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation;<ref>Greene, Jo-Ann. "Pearl Jam and the Secret History of Seattle Part 2." ''Goldmine''. ''August 1993''</ref> he was replaced by [[Matt Chamberlain]], who had previously played with [[Edie Brickell & New Bohemians]]. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the "Alive" video, Chamberlain left to join the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearljamhistory.no.sapo.pt/PJArticles_Interviews_12-xx-93_-_modern_drummer.htm | title=Dave Abbruzzese of Pearl Jam | accessdate=2007-07-01 | author=Peiken, Matt | publisher=''[[Modern Drummer]]'' | date=[[1993-12]]}}</ref> Chamberlain suggested [[Dave Abbruzzese]] as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the ''Ten'' album.

Released on [[August 27]], [[1991]], ''Ten'' (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)<ref name="rhrn" /> contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. ''Ten''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wm02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:a9fuxqe5ldte~T1 | title=Ten > Review | accessdate=2007-07-03 | author=Huey, Steve | publisher=''[[All Music Guide]]''}}</ref> The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching #2 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name="blackdays" /> ''Ten'' produced the hit singles "[[Even Flow]]", "[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", and "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,<ref name="crowe" /> Vedder later revealed that "Alive" tells the semi-biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his step-father, while his mother<U+2019>s grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father.<ref name="crowe" /> The song "Jeremy" ({{audio|Jeremy.ogg|sample}}) and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sshep.com/jeremynew.htm | title=Richardson Teen-ager Kills Himself in Front of Classmates | accessdate=2007-06-27 | author=Miller, Bobbi | publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' | date=[[1991-01-08]]}}</ref> ''Ten'' stayed on the ''Billboard'' charts for more than two years, and has gone on to become one of the biggest-selling rock records ever, going [[RIAA certification|twelve times platinum]].

With the success of ''Ten'', Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Alice in Chains]], and [[Soundgarden]]. The band was criticized in the music press; [[United Kingdom|British]] music magazine ''[[NME]]'' said that Pearl Jam was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets".<ref>Gilbert, Jeff. "New Power Generation". ''Guitar World: Nirvana and the Seattle Sound''. 1993.</ref> Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]] angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band was commercial [[selling out|sellouts]],<ref>Al & Cake. "An interview with...Kurt Cobain". ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]''. May/June 1992.</ref> and  argued ''Ten'' was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads.<ref name="blackdays" /> Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly became friends before Cobain's death in 1994.<ref name="secondcoming"/> Pearl Jam [[Ten Tour|toured]] relentlessly in support of ''Ten''.

In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' and took a slot on that summer's [[Lollapalooza]] tour with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], among others. The band contributed two songs to the [[Singles (soundtrack album)|soundtrack]] of the 1992 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'': "[[State of Love and Trust]]" and "[[Breath (Pearl Jam song)|Breath]]". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in ''Singles'' under the name "Citizen Dick"; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.

===Dealing with success: 1993<U+2013>1995===
[[Image:1101931025 400.jpg|left|thumb|Singer [[Eddie Vedder]] appeared on the cover of the [[October 25]], [[1993]] issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', as part of the feature article discussing the rising popularity of the [[grunge music|grunge]] movement. Vedder had declined to participate, and was upset with the magazine about the cover.<ref>Marks, Craig. "Let's Get Lost". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. December 1994.</ref>]]
The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.<ref name="crowe" /> While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for its video for "Jeremy", including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]], the band refused to make a video for "Black" in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. "Ten years from now," Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."<ref name="crowe" />

Released on [[October 19]], [[1993]], Pearl Jam's second album ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' sold a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the ''Billboard'' top ten that week combined.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308749,00.html | title=Pearl's Jam | accessdate=2007-08-31 | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=[[1993-11-19]]}}</ref> ''Vs.'' included the singles "[[Daughter (Pearl Jam song)|Daughter]]", "[[Dissident (song)|Dissident]]", "[[Go (song)|Go]]", and "[[Animal (Pearl Jam song)|Animal]]". The band decided, beginning with the release of ''Vs.'', to scale back its commercial efforts.<ref>Ashare, Matt. "The Sweet Smell of (Moderate) Success". [[College Music Journal|CMJ]]. July 2000.</ref> The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of "Jeremy" and opted to give fewer interviews and make fewer television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of [[Led Zeppelin]], in that the band "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans."<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. ISBN 0-306-81271-1, pg. 58</ref> During the [[Vs. Tour|''Vs.'' tour]], the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 59</ref>

By 1994, Pearl Jam was "fighting on all fronts", as its manager described the band at the time.<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 60</ref> Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of shows in [[Chicago]], it discovered that ticket vendor [[Ticketmaster]] had added a service charge to the tickets. The [[United States Department of Justice]] was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Gossard and Ament soon testified at a subcommittee investigation in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Wall, Mick. "Alive". ''Nirvana and the Story of Grunge''. ''Q'' p. 99</ref> The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304203,00.html | title=The Brawls in Their Courts | accessdate=2007-09-03 | author=Gordinier, Jeff | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=[[1994-10-28]]}}</ref> After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company.<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 64<U+2013>65</ref> Music critic [[Jim DeRogatis]] noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, "the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, [[The Who]], releasing two or three albums a year." He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album ''[[Vitalogy]]'' was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or that the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay.<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 60</ref>

After Pearl Jam finished the recording of ''Vitalogy'', drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.<ref name="tenpast" /> He was finally replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 [[Bridge School Benefit]], but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 ''Self-Pollution'' satellite radio broadcast.

''Vitalogy'' was released first on [[November 22]], [[1994]] on vinyl and then two weeks later on [[December 6]], [[1994]] on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.<ref name="timeline"/> Many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame.<ref>Weisel, Al. "Pearl Jam: Vitalogy". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[December 15]], [[1994]]. p. 91<U+2013>92.</ref> The song "[[Spin the Black Circle]]", a homage to vinyl records, won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1996 for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]. ''Vitalogy'' also included the songs "[[Not for You|Not For You]]", "[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]", "[[Immortality (Pearl Jam song)|Immortality]]", and "[[Better Man]]". "Better Man" ({{audio-nohelp|Better Man.ogg|sample}}), a song originally penned and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached #1 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.<ref name="tenpast">Weisbard, Eric, et al. "Ten Past Ten". [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' Online]]. August 2001.</ref>

The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its [[Vitalogy Tour|1995 tour]] for ''Vitalogy'', but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 64</ref> Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 65</ref> In the same year Pearl Jam backed [[Neil Young]], whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]''. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.<ref name="Erlewine"/> Two songs from the sessions were left off ''Mirror Ball'': "[[I Got Id]]" and "[[Long Road (song)|Long Road]]". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the EP ''[[Merkin Ball]]''.

===''No Code'' and ''Yield'': 1996<U+2013>1999===
Released on [[August 27]], [[1996]], ''[[No Code]]'' was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since ''Ten'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E4DB1430F936A1575BC0A960958260 | title=Pearl Jam Is Tired of the Pearl Jam Sound | accessdate=2007-06-27 | author=Pareles, Jon | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=[[1996-07-25]]}}</ref> favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. Although the album debuted at #1, it quickly fell down the charts. ''No Code'' included the singles "[[Hail, Hail]]", "[[Who You Are (song)|Who You Are]]" ({{audio|Who You Are.ogg|sample}}), and "[[Off He Goes]]". It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony ("Off He Goes"), Eastern influences ("Who You Are"), and spoken word ("I'm Open"). As with ''Vitalogy'', very little touring was done to promote ''No Code'' because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A [[No Code Tour|European tour]] followed in the fall of 1996.

On [[February 3]], [[1998]], Pearl Jam released its fifth album, ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]''. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kzfwxqwjld6e~T1 | title=Yield > Review | accessdate=2007-07-01 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | publisher=''All Music Guide''}}</ref> but it became the band's first album not to peak at #1 on the ''Billboard'' charts since ''Ten'' in 1991. ''Yield'' debuted at #2, but like ''No Code'' soon began dropping down the charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=305&cfgn=Albums&cfn=The+Billboard+200&ci=3030561&cdi=7316896&cid=05%2F23%2F1998 | title=The Billboard 200 - Yield | accessdate=2007-07-01 | publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref> It included the singles "[[Given to Fly]]" and "[[Wishlist (song)|Wishlist]]". The band hired comic book artist [[Todd McFarlane]] to create an animated video for the song "[[Do the Evolution]]" from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of ''Yield'', ''[[Single Video Theory]]'', was released on DVD later that year.

In June 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes | title=Off He Goes | accessdate=2007-06-28 | author=Fischer, Blair R | publisher=''Rolling Stone'' | date=[[1998-04-17]]}}</ref> but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 [[Yield Tour]] of North America marked the band<U+2019>s return to full-scale touring. The band's [[anti-trust]] lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to "better accommodate concertgoers."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=507492ee-4606-496e-93ae-4b69fb2d3ffa | title=Pearl Jam Yields to Ticketmaster | accessdate=2007-06-27 | author=Symonds, Jeff | publisher=[[E!|E!

[[August 10]], [[1999]].</ref> and after it was completed the band released ''[[Live on Two Legs]]'', a live album which featured select performances from the tour. 

In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "[[Last Kiss]]", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers]]. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 [[fan club]] single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the general public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the [[Kosovo War]].<ref name="timeline"/> The band also decided to include the song on a charity compilation album, ''[[No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees]]''. "Last Kiss" peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' charts and became the band's most successful single to date.

===''Binaural'' and the Roskilde tragedy: 2000<U+2013>2001===
On [[May 16]], [[2000]] Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]''. It was drummer Matt Cameron's recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the [[binaural recording]] techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer [[Tchad Blake]], known for his use of the technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/pjam16.shtml | title=Pearl Jam's 'Binaural' ear-marked by unusual sound mixing | accessdate=2007-06-28 | author=Stout, Gene | publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' | date=[[2000-05-16]]}}</ref> ''Binaural'' was the first album since the band's debut not produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. ''Binaural'' included the singles "[[Nothing As It Seems]]" ({{audio|Nothing As It Seems.ogg|sample}}), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and "[[Light Years (song)|Light Years]]". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.

Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 [[Binaural Tour]] professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of illegal [[bootleg recording]]s.

Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. It released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' Top 200 at the same time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12055527 | title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record | accessdate=2007-06-28 | author=Davis, Darren | publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on [[June 30]], with an accident at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in [[Denmark]]. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. The band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were cancelled, and the band seriously considered retiring after this event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/perl01.shtml | title=Pearl Jam's darkest hour: Seattle band thought about quitting after concert deaths | accessdate=2007-06-28 | author=Stout, Gene | publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' | date=[[2000-09-01]]}}</ref> Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but the band was later cleared of responsibility.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sonymusic.net/artists/PearlJam/rumorpit/release9.html | title=Pearl Jam Releases Full Text of Letter Written By Roskilde Police Department Commissioner Kornerup | accessdate=2007-06-28 | author=Pearl Jam Rumor Pit | publisher=SonyMusic.com | date=[[2000-08-02]]}}</ref>

A few months after the European tour, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On [[October 22]], the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Eddie Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2000p3.shtml | title=Pearl Jam: 2000 Concert Chronology Part 3" | accessdate=2007-07-01 | publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}</ref> The song "Alive" was purposely omitted from all shows on this tour until the [[11/6/00 - Seattle, Washington|final night]] in Seattle. The band performed that night for over three hours, playing most of its hits along with covers such as "[[The Kids Are Alright]]" and "[[Baba O'Riley]]" by [[The Who]]. After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released ''[[Touring Band 2000]]'' the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready joined [[Neil Young]] to perform the song "[[Long Road (song)|Long Road]]" from the ''Merkin Ball'' EP at the ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' benefit concert. The concert, which aired on [[September 21]], [[2001]], raised money for the victims and their families.

===''Riot Act'': 2002<U+2013>2005===
Pearl Jam released its seventh album, ''[[Riot Act (album)|Riot Act]]'' on [[November 12]], [[2002]], and included the singles "[[I Am Mine]]" and "[[Save You]]". The album only sold 500,000 copies in total, fewer than ''Vitalogy'' and ''Vs.'' sold in their first weeks. The album featured a much more [[folk music|folk]]-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of [[Hammond organ|B3]] organist [[Boom Gaspar]] on songs such as "[[Love Boat Captain]]". The track entitled "[[Arc (song)|Arc]]" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2003p3.shtml | title=Pearl Jam: 2003 Concert Chronology Part 3 | accessdate=2007-07-01 | publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}</ref>

In 2003, the band embarked on its [[Riot Act Tour]], which included tours of Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Tokyo]], [[State College]], two shows from [[Madison Square Garden]], and [[Mansfield, Massachusetts|Mansfield]], [[Massachusetts]]. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed ''Riot Act'''s "[[Bu$hleaguer]]", a commentary on [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then typically hanging it on a mike stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had "impaled" the Bush mask on his mike stand at the band's [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] show.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2916155.stm | title=Pearl Jam Bush Stunt Angers Fans | accessdate=2007-07-01 | publisher=''BBC News'' | date=[[2003-04-04]]}}</ref>

In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had "no interest" in signing with another label.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/2003-06-06_msnbc_pearl_jam.pdf | title=The music biz in a Pearl Jam | accessdate=2007-07-02 | author=Olsen, Eric | publisher=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] | date=[[2003-06-05]]}}</ref> The band's first release without a label was the single for "[[Man of the Hour]]", in partnership with [[Amazon.com]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=478580&highlight= | title=Pearl Jam Joins Amazon.com's Advantage Program to Sell Music Directly to Fans | accessdate=2007-07-02 | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=[[2003-12-17]]}}</ref> Director [[Tim Burton]] approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, ''[[Big Fish]]''. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song "[[Man of the Hour]]" for Burton. "Man of the Hour", which was later nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] award, can be heard in the closing credits of ''Big Fish''.

The band released ''[[Lost Dogs (album)|Lost Dogs]]'', a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and ''[[Live at the Garden]]'', a DVD featuring the band's [[July 8]] [[2003]] [[7-8-03 - New York, New York|concert]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] through Epic Records in November 2003.

Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the ''[[Live at Easy Street]]'' album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian [[Pearl Jam 2005 North American/Latin American Tour|cross-country tour]] in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician [[Jon Tester]], then playing the [[Gorge Amphitheater]] before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a [[Rolling Stones]] concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the [[Borgata]] casino in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], before closing the tour with a concert in [[Philadelphia]]. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's website in [[MP3]] form. Pearl Jam also played a [[benefit concert]] to raise money for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief on [[October 5]], [[2005]], at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

To support ''Pearl Jam,'' the band embarked on its [[Pearl Jam 2006 World Tour|2006 world tour]]. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The band served as the headliners for the [[Reading and Leeds Festival|Leeds]] and [[Reading Festival|Reading]] festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]]. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with "guts" but with trust in the audience.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1859687,00.html | title=Leeds Festival | accessdate=2007-07-01 | author=Simpson, Dave. | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=[[2006-08-28]]}}</ref>

In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of [[The Who]]'s "[[Love, Reign o'er Me]]" for the [[Mike Binder]] film, ''[[Reign Over Me]]''; it was later made available as a [[music download]] on the [[ITunes Store|iTunes Music Store]].<ref name="billboardbits">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003496230 | title=Billboard Bits: Pearl Jam, Mariah Carey, Trick Pony | accessdate=2007-07-01 | author=Cohen, Jonathan | publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] | date=[[2006-12-12]]}}</ref> The band embarked on a [[Pearl Jam 2007 European Tour|13-date European tour]], and headlined [[Lollapalooza]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], on [[August 5]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearljam.com/news/index.php?what=News#173 | title=Pearl Jam To Headline Lollapalooza | accessdate=2007-07-01 | publisher=Pearljam.com | date=[[2007-04-02]]}}</ref> The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled ''[[Live at the Gorge 05/06]]'', that documents its shows at [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearljam.com/news/index.php?what=News#178 | title=Pre-order "Live at the Gorge 05/06 | accessdate=2007-07-01 | publisher=Pearljam.com | date=[[2007-05-01]]}}</ref> and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled ''[[Immagine in Cornice|Immagine In Cornice]]'', which documents the band's Italian shows from their 2006 tour will be released.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearljam.com/news/index.php?what=News#194 | title=PJ To Release Italy DVD September 25 | accessdate=2007-07-27 | publisher=Pearljam.com}}</ref>

Pearl Jam has "no set date" for returning to the studio. Since December 2006, band members have been demoing material on their own while remaining in contact via email. In an interview with ''Billboard.com'' in April 2007, McCready stated he had presented some ideas to Stone Gossard and Matt Cameron in separate sessions; he said "When we get it all together, we'll decide to do a record," adding, "That may be a year from now or half-a-year from now."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003567818 | title=With No Album On Horizon, Pearl Jam Touring For Fun | accessdate=2007-07-01 | author=Cohen, Jonathan. | publisher=Billboard.com | date=[[2007-04-05]]}}</ref>

Compared with the other [[Grunge music|grunge]] bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam<U+2019>s style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the [[classic rock]] music of the 1970s.<ref>{{citeweb | last = Unterberger | first = Andrew | url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/pearl-jam/rearviewmirror.htm | title = Pearl Jam: Rearviewmirror | work = [[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]] | 2004-11-18 | accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> Pearl Jam has cited many [[punk rock]] and classic rock bands as influences, including [[The Who]], [[Neil Young]], and the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.skinnymag.co.uk/content/view/1230/142/ | title=Explore and not Explode | accessdate=2007-09-03 | author=Kerr, Dave. | publisher=''[[The Skinny]]'' | year=2006 | month=05}}</ref> Pearl Jam<U+2019>s success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses "the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses."<ref name="Erlewine" />

Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. By 1994<U+2019>s ''[[Vitalogy]]'', the band began to incorporate more punk influences into their music. The band<U+2019>s 1996 album, ''[[No Code]]'', was a deliberate break from the musical style of ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. The songs on the album featured elements of [[garage rock]], [[worldbeat]], and [[Experimental music|experimentalism]].<ref name="Erlewine"/> After 1998<U+2019>s ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]'', which was somewhat of a return to the straight-ahead rock approach of the band's early work, the band dabbled with experimental [[art rock]] on 2000<U+2019>s ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'' and [[folk rock]] elements on 2002<U+2019>s ''[[Riot Act (album)|Riot Act]]''. The band<U+2019>s latest album, 2006<U+2019>s ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'', was cited as a return to the band<U+2019>s early sound.<ref name="PearlJamreview"/><ref name="Easley"/>

Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "[[Jim Morrison]]-like vocal growl."<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 57</ref> Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide"). When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a [[power chord]] thing, and I fit into all that."<ref>Cross, Charles R. "Better Man".

==Legacy==
While [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] had brought [[Grunge Music|grunge]] to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them and became not only the most popular alternative rock band, but the most popular American rock band of the decade.<ref name="Erlewine" /> Pearl Jam has been described as "[[modern rock]] radio's most influential stylists &ndash; the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like "Alive" and "Evenflow" just melodic enough to get moshers singing along."<ref>Sinagra, Laura.

Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic [[Jim DeRogatis]] said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that they "proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime [...] it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]."<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 66</ref> Eric Weisbard of ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'' said in 2001, "The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists."<ref name="tenpast" /> In a 2005 ''[[USA Today]]'' reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2005-07-05-pop-candy_x.htm | title="And the Greatest American rock band ever is..." | accessdate=2007-05-07 | author=Matheson, Whitney | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=[[2005-07-05]]}}</ref> In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded an Esky for "Best Live Act" in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'''s Esky Music Awards.

==Campaigning and activism==
Throughout their career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from [[pro-choice]] sentiments to [[Criticism of George W. Bush|opposition to George W. Bush's presidency]]. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of [[Crohn's disease]], which lead guitarist Mike McCready suffers from, [[Ticketmaster]] venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/3149/review/concert/pearl_jamsleaterkinney | title= Pearl Jam/Sleater-Kinney, Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Portland, OR 7/20/2006 | accessdate=2007-07-10 | author=duBrowa, Cory | publisher=''[[Paste Magazine]]''}}</ref><ref name="causes">{{cite web | url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/activism/alist.html | title=Pearl Jam Synergy | accessdate=2007-06-26 | publisher=Sonymusic.com}}</ref> Vedder has advocated for the release of the [[West Memphis 3]] for years and [[Damien Echols]], a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song "Army Reserve" (from ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?news_Id=116 | title= ECHOLS CONTRIBUTES TO NEW PEARL JAM ALBUM | accessdate=2007-07-22 | publisher=wm3.org}}</ref> The band publicise such causes via their website and include links to alternative news sources.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/activism/ | title=Pearl Jam: Activism and Information | accessdate=2007-06-27 | publisher=PearlJam.com}}</ref>

The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' printed an article by Vedder, entitled "Reclamation", that detailed his views on abortion.<ref>Vedder, Eddie. "Reclamation". ''Spin''. November 1992.</ref> In an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote "PRO-CHOICE!" on his arm in protest.<ref name="tenpast" /> The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice.<ref name="causes" />

As members of [[Rock the Vote]] and [[Vote for Change]], the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in [[Elections in the United States|United States elections]]. Vedder was outspoken in support of [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/log/2000/09/26/vedder/index.html | title=Vedder on Nader: The better man | accessdate=2007-09-03 | author=Talvi, Silja J.

Vedder usually comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including "[[Bu$hleaguer]]" and "[[World Wide Suicide]]", are openly critical of the [[Bush administration]]. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against [[BP Amoco]] dumping effluent in Lake Michigan; at the end of "Daughter", he sang the lyrics "George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the upcoming documentary [[Body of War]], onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced [[Ben Harper]], who contributed vocals to "No More" and "Rockin' in the Free World".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070806/music_nm/lollapalooza_dc_2;_ylt=ApW4t9UIZI8bEXpCnHgM4UEE1vAI | title= Pearl Jam closes Lollapalooza | accessdate=2007-08-06 | author=Krasny, Ros | publisher=[[Yahoo.com]] | date=[[2007-08-06]]}}</ref> The band has since discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the [[AT&T]] webcast of the event, and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearljam.com/news/?what=News#195 | title= LOLLAPALOOZA WEBCAST : SPONSORED/CENSORED BY AT&T? | accessdate=2007-08-08 | publisher=pearljam.com | date=[[2007-08-08]]}}</ref> AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor [[Davie Brown Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135767-c,techindustrytrends/article.html | title=AT&T Says It Didn't Censor Pearl Jam  | accessdate=2007-08-09 | author=Gross, Grant | publisher=[[IDG|IDG News Service]] | date=[[2007-08-09]]}}</ref>
