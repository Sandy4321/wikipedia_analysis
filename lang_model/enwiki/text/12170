After the [[1918 Armistice with Germany]], the squadron returned to the United States in June 1919 and was demobilzied.<ref name="Gorrell"> Series "E", Volume 22, History of the 222d-376th Aero Squadrons.

There is no current [[United States Air Force]] or [[Air National Guard]] unit that holds its lineage or history.

==History==
The 278th Aero Squadron was organized at [[Love Field, Dallas]], Texas on 14 February 1918.  The squadron was trained in various mechanics skills with the [[Curtiss JN-4]]D trainer, and other necessary skills for duty in France.   It was also used to support the operations of the various departments at Love Field.   However, on 8 July 1918, the squadron was ordered to report to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island, for overseas duty.     It was further ordered to report to the Port of Entry, [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and on 18 August 1918, it sailed for the port of [[Brest, France]] on board the [[USS Von Steuben (ID-3017)|USS Von Steuben]], arriving in France on 27 August after an uneventful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="Gorrell"/>

At Brest, the squadron remained at the Pontanesen Barracks awaiting orders until 2 September when it boarded a train bound for the Replacement Concentration Center, AEF, [[St. Maixent Replacement Barracks]] for equipping, and personnel processing.   It arrived at St. Maixent on 4 September and was then further ordered to proceed to the 1st Air Depot at [[Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome]].   There the men were given gas masks and trained how to use the mask with [[tear gas]].  There, the men of the 278th also heard the artillery of the [[Western Front]] for the first time of the Zone of Advance.   On 1 October, it was moved to the nearby [[Autreville Airdrome]] where it began to receive pilots and observers, as well as some [[Dayton-Wright DH-4]] observation aircraft,  the squadron being designated a Corps Observation (reconnaissance) squadron.  It was assigned to the First Army [[VII Corps Observation Group]] on 29 October and was ordered to the [[Gengault Aerodrome]], near [[Toul]] on 10 November. <ref name="Gorrell"/>

However, the Armistice with Germany on 11 November meant the 278th Aero Squadron would not see any combat at the front.   Unfortunately, the squadron did suffer a tragic incident when on 29 November, 2d Lieutenant Ogilieve and Williams were killed in a plane crash.   <ref name="Gorrell"/>

===Third Army of Occupation===
The squadron remained at Gengault Aerodrome until being assigned to [[Wei<U+00DF>enthurm Airdrome]], Germany on 15 April 1919 to serve as part of the occupation force of the [[Rhineland]] under the Third Army Air Service, [[III Corps Observation Group]]. <ref name="Gorrell2"> Series "P", Volume 2, History of Air Service Units Attached to the 3d Army. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917<U+2013>1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.</ref>

There, the squadron began a series of photo-reconnaissance flights in the occupied [[Rhineland]] of major manufacturing centers, important cities and towns in both Occupied Germany as well as [[Luxembourg]].   Lines of communication (railroads, rivers and roads) were carefully mapped and photographed.   In addition, squadron was able to perform test flights on surrendered German aircraft. Flights of the [[Fokker D.VII]], [[Pfalz D.XII]], [[Halberstadt]]s and [[Rumpler]] aircraft were made and evaluations were made.<ref name="Gorrell2"/>

===Demobilization===
On 18 May 1919 orders were received from Third Army for the squadron to report to the 1st Air Depot, [[Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome]] to turn in all of its supplies and equipment and was relieved from duty with the AEF. The squadron's planes were delivered to the Air Service Production Center No. 2. at [[Romorantin Aerodrome]], and there, practically all of the pilots and observers were detached from the Squadron.<ref name="Demob"> Series "D", Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918 <U+2013> May 1919. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917<U+2013>1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.</ref>

Personnel were subsequently assigned to the Commanding General, Services of Supply and ordered to report to one of several staging camps in France.  There, personnel awaited scheduling to report to one of the Base Ports in France for transport to the United States and subsequent demobilization.  The 278th Aero Squadron was demobilized at [[Mitchell Field]], New York on 13 June 1919.<ref name="OOB"/><ref name="Gorrell3">Series "O", Volume 22, Weekly Statistical Reports on progress of Air Service Activities,  October 1918 <U+2013> May 1919.
