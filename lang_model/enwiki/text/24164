'''Theodore Goddard''' (colloquially '''TG''') was an [[England|English]] [[law firm]] based in [[London]]. The firm merged with [[Addleshaw Booth & Co]] on 1 May 2003 to become [[Addleshaw Goddard]]. The firm was  established by '''John Theodore Goddard''', the [[solicitor]] appointed by [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] as an adviser to her during [[divorce]] proceedings and in relation to her involvement during the [[United Kingdom]] [[abdication Crisis of 1936]] (''see [[Theodore Goddard#Role in the abdication|below]]'').

==Origins==
[[Image:John theodore goddard.jpg|thumb|200px|right|John Theodore Goddard from the photo portrait formerly hanging in the London office of Theodore Goddard]]
As a young man of 24, John Theodore Goddard founded the practice of Theodore Goddard & Co in 1902. For some years, he practised on his own account from offices in [[Inns of Court|Clement's Inn]], close by the [[Royal Courts of Justice|Law Courts]]. Working the London court circuit as a [[civil litigation|litigator]], his reputation soon enabled him to attract as a valuable client the newly created office of [[Public trustee|The Public Trustee]]. With the growth of the practice, he moved to new offices in [[Serjeant-at-law|Sergeant's Inn]] in the [[Temple, London|Temple]] area of [[London]] in 1917.

==Growth of the practice==
Over the next 30 years, there was further progress and by 1946 the firm of Theodore Goddard & Co had eight [[partnership|partners]]. John Theodore Goddard become known nationwide when, in 1936, he was instructed by [[Wallis Simpson|Mrs Wallis Simpson]] (the late Duchess of Windsor) to act for her in her divorce proceedings.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,191136,00.html ''Edward and Mrs Simpson cast in new light'']  Richard Norton-Taylor and Rob Evans, ''The Guardian'', Thursday March 2, 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID=4989370&SearchInit=4&CATREF=CAB+127%2F157 Link to papers] from [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] citing J Theodore Goddard as Wallis Simpson's lawyer</ref> When [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]]'s intention to marry Mrs Simpson became known, Goddard became closely involved, at the behest of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]], in the delicate [[abdication]] negotiations.

===Role in the abdication===
Following Mrs Simpson's divorce hearing on 27&nbsp;October 1936, Goddard became concerned that there would be a "patriotic" citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful.<ref name="Cretney">{{citation|url=http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FTthsY9h0CTMyyQJFNvB3TTJynjzK5dpvQx7NXpmpK4ZT0YMhGWQ!147595826?a=o&d=5002027369|first=Stephen|last=Cretney|title=Edward, Mrs. Simpson and the Divorce Law: Stephen Cretney Investigates Whether the Government Colluded in the Suppression of Evidence That Might Have Prevented Wallis Simpson's Divorce and Royal Marriage|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=53|date=September 2003|pages=26 ff.|accessdate=2 May 2010}} (Subscription required)</ref> The courts could not grant a divorce [[Collaborative divorce|by consent of both parties]], and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended [[at-fault divorce]] brought against Mr Simpson, with Mrs Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that Mrs Simpson had [[Collusive lawsuit#At-fault divorce|colluded]] with her husband by, for example, [[Connivance|conniving in]] or [[No-fault divorce#Methods for bypassing the showing-of-fault requirements for divorce|staging the appearance]] of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7&nbsp;December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see his client. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing the visit might put doubts in Mrs Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to [[10 Downing Street|Downing Street]] to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to [[Cannes]].<ref name="Cretney" />

Upon his arrival, Goddard warned his client that a citizen's intervention, should it arise, was likely to succeed. It was, according to Goddard, his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition.<ref name="Cretney" /> Mrs Simpson refused, but they both telephoned the King to inform him that she was willing to give him up so that he could remain King. It was, however, too late; the King had already made up his mind to go, even if he could not marry Mrs Simpson. Indeed, as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength, Goddard stated that: "[his] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/mar/02/monarchy.richardnortontaylor|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|coauthors=Evans, Rob|title=Edward and Mrs. Simpson cast in new light|journal=The Guardian|date=2 March 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

Goddard had a weak heart and had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to accompany him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Mrs Simpson was pregnant,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757202-1,00.html|title=Duchess of Windsor|journal=Time|date=21 December 1936|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> and even that she was having an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Mrs Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).<ref>Beaverbrook, p. 81 and Williams, p. 217</ref>

===The practice generally===
In 1941, the offices suffered a direct hit during a [[The Blitz|Blitz]] [[airstrike|air raid]] and were completely destroyed, together with most of the firm's records and clients' papers. The firm then relocated to New Court, immediately behind the [[Royal Courts of Justice|Law Courts]], which remained its home until its move to the [[City of London]] in 1965.

John Theodore Goddard retired as Senior Partner in 1950 and died in 1952. However, the 1950s saw a period of further growth through amalgamation with, in particular, the City firm of [[Deacons & Pritchard]] (founded in 1834) and the firm of [[Rhys Roberts & Co]] (founded in 1883 by future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] who had been a Partner thereof for many years until his [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]ary duties grew too burdensome).

The firm developed as a balanced general practice, with an emphasis on private client work. The firm was again caught up in one of the biggest political scandals in Britain in the 20th century (the [[Profumo Affair]]). In 1963, then senior partner Derek Clogg was instructed by [[John Profumo]]. The solicitor was referred to in the Hansard transcripts of the House of Commons as "a solicitor of the highest reputation and widest experience" who "has had great experience in cases dealing with libel, with divorce and all those matters where human frailty and possible lying may come into account". The firm was similarly described as being "a very well known firm of London solicitors".<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/jun/17/security-mr-profumos-resignation Hansard Transcript] 17 June 1963</ref> However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Theodore Goddard & Co. attracted many company clients and the commercial side of the practice grew rapidly.

This led to the decision in 1965 to concentrate on this work and move to offices in [[St. Martin's Le Grand]] in the [[City of London]].

Company, commercial and international work continued to increase during the next 20 years, by which time it had become the predominant part of the practice.

By the end of the 1980s the London office had grown to a total of over 300 [[employees|staff]] with over 40 partners. This made it necessary to move offices again in 1990, this time to offices at 150 [[Aldersgate|Aldersgate Street]] (which continued to form part of the London network of offices operated by the [[merger|merged]] firm [[Addleshaw Goddard]] ''see below'').

==The 1990s, 2000s and the merger==
During the expansion of the practice throughout the 1990s, the firm at times experimented with international associate offices in [[Warsaw]], [[Brussels]] and [[Paris]] amongst others. For a short time, there was also a small office run out of [[St Albans|St. Albans]].

Theodore Goddard continued to retain a strong [[Mass media|media and entertainment]] law practice alongside a private client capability (including private [[tax]] work for members of ''[[The Rolling Stones]]'', [[David Bowie]] and others,<ref>[http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=98439&d=11&h=24&f=23 The Dude of Tax] 
Fiona Callister in ''The Lawyer'' 25 March 2002</ref> and [[defamation]] [[lawyer]]s) at a time when many City [[law firm]]s were divesting themselves of such business areas and concentrating on pure corporate matters. This diversity occasionally gave rise to high-profile cases involving [[celebrity|celebrities]] including the firm's instruction in relation to the ''[[Hello! magazine]]'' dispute over photographs of [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]'s wedding to [[Michael Douglas]]<ref>[http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=100786&d=11&h=24&f=23 ''The Douglases and OK! v Hello!: the photo finish''] Naomi Rovnick in ''The Lawyer'' 27 January 2003</ref> and its appointment by [[Michael Jackson]] to advise on the controversial ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'' [[Documentary film|documentary]].<ref>[http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=99055&d=11&h=24&f=23 ''Jacko jumps the gun with Theodores''] 
Helen Power in ''The Lawyer'' 10 February 2003</ref> 
 
Toward the end of the 1990s and the early part of the 21st century, the firm was linked to a succession of potential merger targets including a rejected offer from [[Eversheds]] in 1993 and a proposed tri-partite amalgamation in 1998 with [[Richards Butler]] and [[Denton Wilde Sapte|Denton Hall]]. However, following a third failed merger attempt in 2001, this time with [[Salans|Salans Hertzfeld & Heilbronn]], the firm's credibility as a viable partnership was beginning to be called into question in both the legal press and the wider profession.<ref>[http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=102375&d=11&h=24&f=23 Theodore Goddard-Salans marriage plans fizzle out] Naomi Rovnick in ''The Lawyer'' 24 September 2001</ref>

Consequently, in early 2003 following an approach by [[North of England]] firm [[Addleshaw Booth & Co]], the fourth proposed merger was approved with very little resistance from the partnership.<ref>[http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=100759&d=11&h=24&f=23 ''The Lawyer''] ''TG partners braced for Addleshaws takeover'', Naomi Rovnick 17 February 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=99552&d=11&h=24&f=23 ''The Lawyer''] ''Theodores partners vote for takeover by Addleshaws'', Naomi Rovnick 16 April 2003</ref> Five years on, the merger was described as "the most successful law firm merger since 2000".<ref>[http://cde.cerosmedia.com/1Z48be94d6f1b52852.cde UK 200 Annual Report], ''The Lawyer'' (2008)</ref> As of 2010 the merged firm of [[Addleshaw Goddard]] continued to operate out of offices in [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]] and [[London]].
