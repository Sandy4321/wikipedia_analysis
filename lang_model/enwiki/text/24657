'''Finnlines [[osakeyhti<U+00F6>|Oy]]''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[shipping company]] that operates freight throughout Northern [[Europe]] as well as passenger services in the [[Baltic Sea]]. In the past, Finnlines has operated ships under the brands '''Finncarriers''', '''Finnflow Systems''', '''Finnjet Lines''', and '''FG Shipping Oy Ab'''.  As of 2006, [[Grimaldi Group]] is the largest owner of Finnlines with 50.7% of all shares<ref>[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/talous/vasen/id53851.html YLE News], retrieved on February 20, 2007</ref>.

Finnlines also owns the ''Polfin Line'', the ''Trans-Russia Express'' and the port operator ''Finnsteve''.

Finnlines was founded in 1947 as a subsidiary of '''Merivienti Oy''', founded earlier the same year by [[Enso-Gutzeit]] and [[Kansanel<U+00E4>kelaitos]], to operate Merivienti's liner service from Finland to the United States.<ref name="Karonen 17">{{cite book |title=Enso-Gutzeit Oy laivanvarustajana: Oy Finnlines Ltd ja Merivienti Oy 1947-1982 |last=Karonen |first=Petri |year=1992 |publisher=Enso-Gutzeit |location=Imatra |isbn=952-9690-00-2 |pages=pp. 17-23 |url= }}</ref>

==History==
===1947-1977===

Merivienti Oy ({{lang-en|Sea Export Ltd.}}) was founded on {{date|1947-04-18}} by the Finnish [[forest industry]] giant [[Enso-Gutzeit]] and [[Kansanel<U+00E4>kelaitos]] (Finnish Social Insurance)<U+2014>both completely or partially [[state-owned company|state-owned companies]]<U+2014>to ensure transportation of forest industry products from Finland to [[Western block]] countries.<ref name="Karonen 17" /> According to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|1947 Paries Peace Treaty]] with the [[Soviet Union]], Finland had to pay US$300 million worth of [[war reparations]] to the Soviet Union, mostly in industrial goods. With only 30% of the Finnish merchant fleet having survived the war, and 2/3 of the surviving ships being used by the [[allied forces]] or under forced charter to the Soviet Union, new tonnage was desparately needed.<ref>Karonen (1992). p. 11</ref>

In May and June 1947 Merivienti acquired three used second-hand [[steamship|steamers]] for traffic into Europe. During the same year Merivienti decided to start [[liner]] traffic from Finland to the east coast of the [[United States]]. With this in mind Merivienti acquired three larger second-hand steamships, named {{SS|Hamina}}, {{SS|Pankakoski}} and {{SS|Tornator}}. To operate these ships a new company, Oy Finnlines Ltd, was founded in November 1947. Finnlines was a 100% subsidiary of Merivienti and owned no ships of it's own<U+2014>instead the Merivienti ships were operated by and marketed as Finnlines.<ref name="Karonen 17" /> In subsequent years vessels owned by other companies, such as Enso-Gutzeit, [[Neste]], [[Outokumpu]], [[Yhtyneet paperitehtaat]], [[Amer-Tupakka]] and [[Thomesto]].<ref>Karonen (1992). pp. 135-137</ref> Finnlines' traffic into the United States begun in 1948.<ref name="Finnlines55">[http://www.finnlines.fi/uploads/m5g052j12bv8h.pdf Finnlines' 55 Years], retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> The used ships were soon found to be too small and during the 1950s seven new [[freighter]]s were delivered to various owned to be operated by Finnlines. At this time the company started using names with the "Finn" prefix that has become characteristic of their fleet.<ref name="Baltic">[http://www.vuosikertomus.finnlines.fi/2004/?PageId=510&site=1 The Development of Finnlines' Baltic Fleet], retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> A line to the [[United Kingdom]] was opened in 1955.<ref name="Finnlines55" />

[[Image:Capella av Stockholm model.jpg|thumb|left|A model of Finncarriers' MS ''Capella av Stockholm'', built 1972 as MS ''Hans Gutzeit''. The model retains the original Finnlines colours, with the Finnlines text on the hull replaced by a Finncarriers text.]]
The company first begun carrying passengers in 1962, when the car ferry [[MS Hansa Express|MS ''Hansa Express'']] opened a new service linking [[Hanko]], Finland to [[Travem<U+00FC>nde]], [[Germany]] via [[Visby]] in [[Sweden]].<ref name="Finnlines55" /> The ship was found to be too small from the start, and Hanko a poor choice for the Finnish terminus of the line. The route was altered to [[Helsinki]]-[[Kalmar]]-[[Travem<U+00FC>nde]] in 1963, and two large new ferries were delivered for the route in 1966.<ref name="Baltic" /> [[MS Finnhansa (1966)|MS ''Finnhansa'']] was the larger of the two sister ships, surpassing [[MS Finnpartner (1966)|MS ''Finnpartner'']] by ten centimeters;<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=4152.msg46687#msg46687 FCBS Forum], retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> it was the largest ferry in the Baltic Sea at the time. Having two ferries year-round proved to be unprofitable and the Finnpartner was sold in 1969.<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/finnpartner_1966.htm M/S Finnpatner (1966)] at ''Fakta om Fartyg'' {{sv icon}}, retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> In the late 60s Finnlines developed the ''Finnflow'' cargo-handling system, which resulted in the building of the company's first [[RORO]] freighters [[MS Finncarrier|MS ''Finncarrier'']], [[MS Hans Gutzeit|MS ''Hans Gutzeit'']] and [[MS Finnfellow|MS ''Finnfellow'']].<ref name="Baltic" />

In 1973 Finnlines purchased MS ''Stena Atlantica'' from [[Stena Line]] and renamed her [[MS Finnpartner (1973)|MS ''Finnpartner'']], for service to Germany alongside the ''Finnhansa''. During the winter season the second ''Finnpartner'' was sent cruising to the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name="Saga">{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/saga_1966.htm M/S Saga (1966)] at ''Fakta om Fartyg'' {{sv icon}}, retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> In the same year Finnlines also placed an order at the [[W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4>]] Helsinki shipyard for a new [[gas turbine]]-powered ferry for the Finland-Germany service that was to be the largest, longest, and fastest in the world.<ref name="Finnjet">[http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/fakten/chronik.htm finnjetweb.com - Finnjet chronicle], retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> Before the new ferry was delivered several changes occurred to Finnlines: in 1975 Finnlines and their rival [[Finland Steamship Company]] (F<U+00C5>A, which later became Effoa) began collaborating in freight and passenger traffic.<ref name="Finnlines55" /> ''Finncarriers'' was formed as a joint freight operator, while the Finland Steamship Company's Finland-Germany passenger services were merged into Finnlines' services, bringing [[MS Finlandia (1967)|MS ''Finlandia'']] to Finnlines' fleet.<ref name="Finlandia">{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/finlandia_1967.htm M/S Finlandia (1967)] at ''Fakta om Fartyg'' {{sv icon}}, retrieved 4 May 2007</ref> This meant the second Finnpartner was chartered to [[Olau Line]].<ref name="Saga" /> With the ''Finlandia'' and ''Finnhansa'', Finnlines maintained a year-round service to Germany, while [[MS Bore Star|MS ''Bore Star'']] was chartered from [[Bore Line]] for cruising for the winter seasons of 1975-76 and 76-77 (she was marketed under the name ''Finnpartner'').<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/bore_star_1975.htm M/S Bore Star] at ''Fakta om Fartyg'' {{sv icon}}, retrieved 4 May 2007</ref>

===1977-1987===

The new, large, fast [[GTS Finnjet|GTS ''Finnjet'']] was delivered to Finnlines in May 1977,<ref name="Finnjet" /> replacing both of the old ferries on the route. With her 31-knot top speed the ''Finnjet'' was able to cross the Baltic in a mere 22 hours, and her accommodations were superior to those of any ferry of the day. Unfortunately she had also been designed before the [[oil crisis]], meaning her operational costs were much higher than originally planned.<ref name="Baltic" /> After delivery of the ''Finnjet'', the ''Finlandia'' was rebuilt into the cruise ship [[MS Finnstar (1977)|MS ''Finnstar'']], becoming Finnlines' first (and to date last) genuine cruise ship. The ''Finnstar''<nowiki></nowiki>'s service was cut short by the Finnish maritime worker's strike of 1980, as result of which she ceased service and was laid up in [[Barcelona]]. In May 1981 she was sold to the Loke Shipping Co.<ref name="Finlandia" /> In October of the same year, the ''Finnjet'' was rebuilt with additional diesel engines, allowing for more economic operations during the off-season.<ref name="Baltic" />

In 1982 the first of the new "jumbo-[[RORO]]" ships was built for the Finland-United Kingdom run. Four sister ships were built over the next decade.<ref name="Baltic" /> Also in 1982, Enso-Gutzeit decided to give up its shipping activities and as a result 75% of Finnlines was sold to other shipping companies. All Enso-Gutzeit ships sailing for Finncarriers were sold to [[Effoa]] or [[Neste Oy]] and all of Enso-Gutzeit's shares of Finncarriers were sold to Effoa. Finncarriers thus became a subsidiary of Effoa.<ref name="Finnlines55" /> Several mergers followed during the 1980s when Effoa merged various other companies it completely or partially owned into Finncarriers.<ref name="Baltic" /> In 1986 Enso-Gutzeit finally bowed out of shipping activities completely when they sold their remaining share of GTS ''Finnjet'' (25%) to Effoa, who transferred the ship into the fleet of their other subsidiary [[Silja Line]].<ref name="Finnjet" /> In the same year a new company, ''Finnlink'', was founded to operate freight between Finland and Sweden. The company's owners were mainly the same as the owners of Finnlines, and Finnlines itself owned 15% of Finnlink.<ref name="Finnlines55" />

===1987-2002===

[[Image:Finnhansa-Finnpartner-Transeuropa.jpg|thumb|Finnlines ships in [[Helsinki]] in late 2004]]
A full turn-around in Effoa's operations took place in 1989 when the company decided to separate their freight-carrying operations from their passenger operations. In place of dividends, shares of Finncarriers were given to stock owners, and after several mergers, diffusions, and name-changes, a new ''Finnlines Group'' was born in 1990. In the following years Finnlines acquired [[Bore Line]], the operations of which were incorporated into Finnlines in 1992.<ref name="Finnlines55" /> Around the same time Finnlines started collaboration with the German shipping company [[Poseidon Schiffahrt AG]] on Helsinki-Travem<U+00FC>nde traffic, which was marketed under the name ''Finncarriers-Poseidon.'' During 1994 and 1995 four new combi-roro ships (known as the [[Hansa class]]), capable of carrying 114 passengers alongside their freight capacity, were delivered for Finncarriers-Poseidon traffic.<ref name="Baltic" />

In 1997 Finnlines made a deal with the German [[Stinnes AG]], essentially swapping the shared Finnlines ownership of the German company [[BLT]] with the full ownership of Poseidon Schiffahrt AG. As a result the company name "Poseidon" disappeared from the sides of Finland-Germany ships and Poseidon became Finnlines Deutschland AG. With Poseidon, the trainferry operator [[Railship]] and 40% of [[Team Lines]] also passed into Finnlines' ownership. In the same year Finnlines also became the sole owner of Finnlink.<ref name="Finnlines55" /> In 1999 Finnlines took delivery of two new [[ro-pax]] vessels, [[MS Finnclipper|MS ''Finnclipper'']] and [[MS Finneagle|MS ''Finneagle'']], both with a passenger capacity of over 400.<ref name="Baltic" /> In 2001 Finncarriers was merged into the parent company. In the same year Finnlines purchased the rest of Team Lines, and in 2002 the Swedish [[Nord<U+00F6>-Link]] (trafficking between [[Malm<U+00F6>]] and Travem<U+00FC>nde) also became a Finnlines subsidiary.<ref name="Finnlines55" />

===2002-Present===

In 2004 Finnlines decided to further simplify the myriad of names under which it operated ships, merging Finnlink and Nord<U+00F6>-Link into the parent company. Finnlines also ordered five new large [[ro-pax]] ferries from the [[Italy|Italian]] shipyard [[Fincantieri]].<ref name="Baltic" /> After numerous delays, the first vessel, [[MS Finnstar|MS ''Finnstar'']] was delivered in August 2006 for the Helsinki-Travem<U+00FC>nde service, [[MS Finnmaid|MS ''Finnmaid'']] followed later in the same year, while [[MS Finnlady|MS ''Finnlady'']], [[MS Europalink|MS ''Europalink'']] and [[MS Nordlink|MS ''Nordlink'']] were delivered in February, March and July 2007, respectively.<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=8824.0 FCBS Forum - Finnlines builds new ropaxes], retrieved 4 May 2007</ref><ref name="Interim">[http://www.finnlines.fi/asp/system/empty.asp?P=56&VID=default&SID=652192388357893&A=open:news:item:1760&S=1&C=28085 Finnlines interim report 1 January - 30 June 2007], retrieved 20. 8. 2007</ref> Coinciding with the delivery of MS ''Nordlink'' the old [[M/ Malm<U+00F6> Link|MS ''Malm<U+00F6> Link'']] was sold.<ref name="Interim" /> In January 2007 the Italian Grimaldi Group became the largest owner of Finnlines and expressed interest in purchasing the entire company. However, a public tender offer made to the other owners in November 2006 resulted in Grimaldi gaining only 85,029 stocks, or 0.18% of the total.<ref name="Interim" /> In August 2007 it was reported that Finnlines has ordered six new [[ice class]]ed roro vessels from the [[Jinling Shipyard]] in [[China]], with planned delivery dates in 2010 for the first two vessels and 2011 for the remaining four.<ref>[http://www.finnlines.fi/asp/system/empty.asp?P=56&VID=default&SID=613728000190211&A=open:news:item:1785&S=1&C=34746 Finnlines press release: Finnlines investing in new roro vessels], retrieved 24. 8. 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.optimashipbrokers.com/optima/SiteResources/data/MediaArchive/files/downloads/2007/WEEK%2033%202007.pdf Optima Shipbrokers: Optima Weekly volume 171, week 33], retrieved 20. 8. 2007</ref>
