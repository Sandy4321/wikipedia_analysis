'''Mary Jo Kilroy''' (born April 30, 1949) is an [[United States|American]] attorney and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician from [[Ohio]]. Kilroy is a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative-elect]] and an outgoing two-term [[Ohio county government#Board of County Commissioners|County Commissioner]] of [[Franklin County, Ohio]], which includes the capital city of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], including its downtown area, and some of its surrounding suburban and rural areas. Previously she served two four-year terms on the Columbus School Board after working in private practice.

In both the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006 United States House of Representatives elections]], Kilroy was involved in extremely close elections for [[Ohio's 15th congressional district]]. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of [[absentee ballot]]s and [[election recount]]s. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results.

''Governing'' magazine named Franklin County as being among the five best-managed counties in the country during Kilroy's tenure. Also, Kilroy was named the Public Official of the Year by the Central Ohio Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers as a result of her role in creating the Columbus/Franklin County Affordable Housing Trust.<ref name=8taMJK/> Her term as commissioner was not without controversy, however. Kilroy came under fire during the awarding of contracts for the construction of [[Huntington Park (Columbus, Ohio)|Huntington Park]] because the lowest bid for the concrete was rejected in favor of a higher bid by a [[union shop]].<ref>{{Citation
