'''New York State Route 304''' is a [[New York State Route]] that is entirely located in Central [[Rockland County]]. NY 304 begins at the NY/NJ border in [[Pearl River, New York]], and ends at [[US 9W]]. Though it crosses both the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], it accesses neither of the two major highways. The route was assigned to its current route in [[1930]] and is a main route in Rockland County.

==Route description==
NY 304 begins at the NY/NJ border in Pearl River.<ref name="google">{{cite map|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=RT-304,+Rockland,+New+York,+United+States&sll=41.117642,-74.09729&sspn=0.238471,0.461426&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=0,41.115040,-73.994390&ll=41.126694,-73.994293&spn=0.119219,0.230713&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1|title=Overview Map of NY 304|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> Directly south of the border is [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]] in [[Bergen County]], in which NY 304 continues as [[County Route 503 (New Jersey)|Bergen CR 503]]. NY 304 quickly becomes a four-lane road intersecting [[County Route 33 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 33]] and [[County Route 30 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 30]] in Pearl River. CR 33 provides a link to the downtown business district of Pearl River via Central Ave. After its intersection with CR 30, NY 304 becomes a four-lane, limited access highway. This highway runs for about a mile and a half, with at grade intersections with CR 33/Middletown Rd in Pearl River, and NY 59 in [[Nanuet, New York|Nanuet]].<ref name="google"/>

At its intersection with former NY 59A (West Nyack Rd), NY 304 reverts back to being a four-lane, full access road. Here it passes over the [[New York State Thruway]] and [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] within a quarter-mile of each other. NY 304 doesn't intersect either of the highways because of the Thruway/PIP interchange literally a jump to the east of when NY 304 crosses both highways. NY 304 continues north, and at [[County Route 27 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 27]] (Germonds Rd) it enters [[New City, New York|New City]]. NY 304 provides a link to the downtown business district of New City at its intersection with Main St. NY 304 then gains a 55mph speed limit again north of this location. It doesn't become a full highway like before, but other than having a few traffic lights, NY 304 provides a quick route to [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]]. NY 304 stays four-lanes until its intersection with [[County Route 80 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 80]]. NY 304 reverts back to two-lanes, but stays a 55mph road. Finally, after crossing [[County Route 23 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 23]] in north New City, NY 304 makes its final push toward its northern terminus at [[US 9W]]. NY 304 ends at US 9W just inside the [[Haverstraw (town), New York|Haverstraw]] townline, less than a mile north of [[New York State Route 303|NY 303]]'s northern terminus. The intersection between NY 304 and US 9W is a mere 7/10 of a mile north of the intersection of [[New York State Route 303|NY 303]] & [[US 9W]].<ref name="google"/>

==History==
Route 304 was a route formed in the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]] stretching from the state line and ending at [[U.S. Route 9W]].<ref name="1930gb">''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> Route 304 was a road routed along East Washington Avenue (CR 35), Middletown Road (CR 33), Church Street and Smith Street.<ref name="pearlriver">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NY-304/|title=Pearl River-Haverstraw Expressway - NYC Roads.com|format=HTML|publisher=Steve Anderson|date=[[2007]]|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> Traffic forecasters predicted that the road would have 30-40,000 people a day going at 10-15 mph in [[1980]]. Since the road would not be able to sustain that amount, a new bypass was opened in [[1970]] and numbered 304. The [[New York State Department of Transportation]] report that the bypass handles about 25,000 cars a day.<ref name="pearlriver"/>
