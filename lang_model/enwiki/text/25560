The '''Egtved Girl''' (''c''. [[1388 BC|1390]]&ndash;[[1370 BC]]) was a [[Nordic Bronze Age]] girl whose well-preserved remains were found at [[Egtved]] ({{coor dm|55|37|N|9|18|E|}}), [[Denmark]] in [[1921]]. Aged 16&ndash;18 at death, she was slim, 160 cm tall, had long blonde hair and well-trimmed nails. Her burial has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to precisely [[1370 BC]]. She was discovered in a [[tumulus|barrow]] approximately 30 metres wide and 4 metres high.

==The find==
The barrow was [[excavated]] in 1921, and an east-western aligned coffin was found. It was transported in sealed condition to the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], where it was opened and the Egtved Girl discovered. 

She was buried fully dressed on a cowhide in the coffin. She wore a loose [[bodice]] with sleeves reaching the elbow. She had a bare waist and wore a short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets and a woolen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. At her feet were the cremated remains of a child age 5&ndash;6. By her head, there was a small [[birch bark]] box which contained an [[awl]], bronze pins and a [[hair net]]. Before the coffin was closed she was covered with a [[blanket]] and a cowhide.  Flowering [[yarrow]] (indicating a summer burial) and a bucket of beer made of wheat, honey, [[bog-myrtle]] and [[cowberry|cowberries]] were placed atop.  Her distinctive outfit, which caused a sensation when it was unearthed in the [[1920s]], is the best preserved example of a style now known to be common in [[Northern Europe]] during the [[Bronze Age]]. 

The outfit was reconstructed for the [[National Museum of Denmark]] by the [[Lejre Experimental Centre]]. A reconstructed set of clothes, as well as details of the excavation, are on display in the Egtved Girl's museum at the excavation site.
