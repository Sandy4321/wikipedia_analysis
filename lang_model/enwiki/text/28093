"'''Do Somethin''''" is a song by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]] from her first greatest hits compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]''. It was released on February 14, 2005 by [[Jive Records]] as the second single from the album worldwide except North America. Produced by [[Bloodshy & Avant]], the song was never intended to be released as a single and Spears had to convince her record company to shoot a music video for it. "Do Somethin'" is a [[dance-pop]] song with usage of electric guitars. Lyrically, it refers to having a good time and not caring about other people's judgement. It received positive reviews from critics. 

Although "Do Somethin'" was not released in the United States, it charted on many of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s component charts due to digital downloads and reached number one-hundred on the [[Hot 100]]. It was also successful worldwide, reaching top ten positions in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video was co-directed by [[Billie Woodruff]] and Spears, who appeared credited as her [[alter ego]] "Mona Lisa". It depicts Spears and four female friends dancing and performing in a nightclub. The usage of a [[Louis Vuitton]] dashboard in the video resulted in a lawsuit against Jive Records, which ended with Louis Vuitton winning 80,000 EUR in damages. Spears has performed "Do Somethin'" in her 2007 [[The M+M's Tour|M+M's]] promo tour and her 2009 world tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]].

==Background and composition==
"Do Somethin'" was produced by Swedish team [[Bloodshy & Avant]], who produced her single "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" from her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). The song was recorded and arranged at Murlyn Studios,  in [[Stockholm, Sweden]]. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in [[New York City]]. [[Background vocals]] were provided by Spears, Angelo Hunte and BlackCell.<ref>''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'' liner notes. [[Jive Records]] (2004)</ref> The song was never planned to be released as a single. However, Spears wanted to shoot a [[music video]] for the song and had to fight with her record label to do it. She explained she was "a little disappointed" that she had to convince them "that making this video was the right thing to do at th[e] time".<ref name=break>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495295/20050104/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Clarifies: I'm Taking A Break From Being Told What To Do|date=2005-01-04|accessdate=2010-03-06| last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|work= ''[[MTV]]''|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]}}</ref> "Do Somethin'" is an [[dance-pop]] song with usage of [[electric guitar]]s and a "bump [[beat (music)|beat]]", as described by Spence D. of [[IGN]].

The music video for "Do Somethin'" was filmed in December 2004 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It was co-directed by Spears and [[Billie Woodruff]], who previously worked with her in "[[Born to Make You Happy]]". Spears described the shoot as "hectic", adding it was filmed "in a record-breaking five hours". She also commented about co-directing with Wooodruff, saying that "he had no no ego whatsoever, and the whole process was just so much fun".<ref name=break/> Spears is credited as "Mona Lisa" in the video, as she said "I kinda think she's like my [[alter ego]] whenever I feel like being mean or possibly like bustin' people around to get stuff right&nbsp;... It's kinda easier to be called 'Mona Lisa' instead of Britney".<ref name=monalisa/> The video was also choreographed and styled entirely by Spears, with clothing from [[Juicy Couture]]. Spears ultimately added that working behind the camera inspired her to become a director in the future, explaining, "After doing about 20 videos, it gets kind of boring playing the same role. I feel like being behind the camera is sometimes more satisfying than being in front of it".<ref name=break/> Since the music video was not going to be serviced in the United States, it was set to premiere in [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] on January 21, 2005. However, it was leaked online on January 18, 2005.<ref name=hummer>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495980/20050118/spears_britney.jhtml|title=New Britney Clip Has Flying Hummer, More Underwear Dancing|date=2005-01-18|accessdate=2010-03-21| last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|work= ''[[MTV]]''|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]}}</ref>

In the music video, Spears wears a pink mid-riff t-shirt reading "Love Boat" and a pin capelet going to a club named Hole in the Wall with four blond bandmates. During the first verse, they fly in a pink [[Hummer]] and move their heads to the beat on the song, while Spears puts the truck on [[autopilot]].<ref name=hummer/> The Hummer's [[dashboard]] has a [[Louis Vuitton]] pattern.<ref name=forbes/> They finally arrive to the club and dance in the dancefloor while being stared by other people. Near the end of the video, Spears and her bandmates start performing on a stage. The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears in a separate room, wearing black underwear and a white mini fur coat, that was compared to the black-and-white scenes in the music video for "[[My Prerogative#Britney_Spears|My Prerogative]]". Jennifer Vineyard of MTV described Spears's attitude in the video as "[going] back and forth between trying to look sexy and then goofy".<ref name=hummer/>

On November 18, 2007, it was reported by ''[[Forbes]]'' that [[LVMH]]'s Louis Vuitton won a lawsuit on 80,000 EUR in damages for the close-up shots of the truck's dashboard, which featured the brand's logo without autorization. The tribunal found the director of the video had clearly emphasised the logo. The tribunal ruled that responsibility for the unauthorised use lay with [[Sony BMG]], its subsidiary [[Zomba Group of Companies]] as well as [[MTV|MTV Online]], and not Spears herself.<ref name=forbes>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/11/18/afx4351957.html|title=LVMH's Louis Vuitton unit wins Britney Spears video ban, damages - report|date=2007-11-18|accessdate=2010-03-21| last=Reporter|first=Thomson Financial|work=''[[Forbes.com]]''|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}</ref> The music video was also banned in all European TV channels.<ref name=louis>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a80259/spears-music-video-banned-in-europe.html|title=  Spears' music video banned in Europe|date=2007-11-20|accessdate=2010-03-21| last=Dadds|first=Kimberley|work= ''[[Digital Spy]]''|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK}}</ref>

==Live performances==
Spears performed "Do Somethin'" during [[The M+M's Tour]] in May 2007. After a performance of "Breathe on Me" from ''[[In the Zone]]'', in which Spears and her four female dancers picked a man from the audience and danced seductively around him, the stage went dark for a few seconds. Shortly after, Spears took the stage again wearing a hot pink bra, a white fur coat and a jean skirt to perform the song. The choreography was a mimicry of the music video.<ref name=mms>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1558527/20070502/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney's Back!
