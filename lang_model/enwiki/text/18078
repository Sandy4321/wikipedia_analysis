'''Sasha''' (born '''Alexander Coe'''<ref>The nickname ''Sasha'' is a common [[Diminutive|diminutive]] version of the name ''Alexander''.</ref> on [[4 September]] [[1969]]), is a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[disc jockey|DJ]] and [[record producer]]. Sasha began his career playing [[acid house]] dance music in the late 1980s, and became a central figure in the development and popularisation of [[electronic dance music]].  He partnered with fellow DJ [[John Digweed]] in 1993, touring internationally and producing a series of [[mix album|mix]]es (compilations of other artists work played in a continuous fashion).<ref name="amg-sd">{{cite web|last = Birchmeier|first = Jason|title=Sasha + John Digweed biography |work=[[All Music Guide]] |url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lna9ke9tkq7c~T1 |accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref>  Through their track selection and mixing techniques, Sasha and Digweed were instrumental in the evolution of [[progressive trance]] and [[house music]].<ref name="virgin">{{cite web|last=McGeachin |first=Nick |url=http://www.virginmegamagazine.com/default.asp?aid=C5B |title= Sasha: His Life, The Music & Neil Young? |work= [[Virgin Group|Virgin Megamagazine]] |date= [[2004-09-24]] |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060127234924/http://www.virginmegamagazine.com/default.asp?aid=C5B |archivedate = 2006-01-27}}</ref>

Sasha has produced multiple [[UK]]-charting singles<ref name="chartstats">{{cite web|title=Chart Stats: Sasha|work=Chartstats.com |url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=6999 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> and has [[remix|remixed]] tracks for artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[The Chemical Brothers]].  His remix of [[Felix da Housecat]]'s "Watching Cars Go By" earned him a 2004 [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination.

After achieving success as a producer and DJ, Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as [[Brian Transeau]] and [[James Zabiela]], influencing their musical styles and techniques.  His use of live [[audio engineering]] equipment helped popularise technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on [[gramophone record|records]] and [[phonograph|turntables]].<ref name="prefix">{{cite web|last=James |first=Colin |title=Sasha: No rest for the world's last 'rock-star deejay' |work=[[Prefix Magazine]] |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/S/Sasha/173 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  Despite the changing trends in electronic dance music, Sasha continues to perform in large dance venues and is currently on an intercontinental tour of large European and United States venues.<ref name="djsashatourdates">{{cite web|publisher = Djsasha.com | title=Sasha tour dates (navigate to "Tour Dates")|url=http://www.djsasha.com/ |accessdate=2006-12-31 }}</ref>

==Early years==

Sasha was born in [[Bangor, Wales]] in 1969, but spent most of his youth with his mother in the Welsh town of [[Hawarden]].  Sasha's early musical taste was primarily [[Top 40]] pop music like [[The The]] and [[The Police]].<ref name="bbc-wales">{{cite web|title=Sasha speaks |publisher = [[BBC]] Wales |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/features/djsasha.shtml |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  After an "idyllic childhood", he passed the entrance exam for Epsom Public School at age 17.<ref name="bbc-wales"/>  He did not like Epsom, however, and left before completing his [[Advanced Level (UK)|Advanced Level]] (an academic qualification in England, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]]).  Instead of continuing his schooling, Sasha moved to Bangor to live with his father and stepmother.  Sasha's stepmother forced him to take piano lessons which, although he disliked them at the time, Sasha ultimately found to be beneficial to his music career.<ref name="soundrevolt">{{cite web|title=Sasha profile |url= http://www.soundrevolt.com/artists-97-en.html |accessdate=2006-12-31|work=SoundRevolt}}</ref>

Sasha became aware of electronic dance music in 1988 at [[The Ha<U+00E7>ienda]], a [[Manchester]] dance venue.<ref name="djtimes">{{cite web|last = Dresden |first=Dave |work= [[DJ Times]] | publisher = Reprinted at [[about.com]] | title=Interview with Sasha | url= http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntSashaDave.htm | date = [[1997-07-07]] | accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  Drawn to the rough sound of [[acid house]] music and the rebellious attitude he associated with it, he visited Manchester weekly and soon moved to nearby [[Disley]].<ref name="ra-feature">{{cite web|title=Sasha - Standing the Test of Time |work= [[Resident Advisor]] | date = [[2004-10-18]] |url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?ID=509 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204102420/http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?ID=509 |archivedate = 2005-02-04}}</ref>  Sasha purchased many acid house records, and began to teach himself how to [[DJ mix|mix]].  A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented announced that he was looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour.  Sasha volunteered, and made his first live appearance in nearby [[Stockport]].  Sasha recalled of his debut, "I'd never even touched a [[Technics]]: I thought the [[pitch control]] was the volume, I didn't even know where to plug my headphones in! I'm sure I was absolutely horrendous."<ref name="soundrevolt"/>

Sasha soon found himself in debt due to low-paying performances and the many records he bought.<ref name="djtimes"/>  To finance his record collection, he performed at illegal warehouse [[rave]]s in the [[Blackburn]] and [[Blackpool]] areas.  With the assistance of another local DJ, [[Jon DaSilva]], Sasha secured work at The Ha<U+00E7>ienda, where he learned [[key mixing]] (matching melodic keys) from DaSilva and refined his ability to [[beatmatch]] (to synchronize the beats of two simultaneously playing records).  Though he enjoyed playing at The Ha<U+00E7>ienda, in 1991 Sasha left for a club called [[Shelley's Laserdrome]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].<ref name="djtimes"/>  There, he established part of his signature sound by mixing euphoric [[trance music]] with [[techno music|hard techno]] and emotional [[a cappella]]s.<ref name="soundrevolt"/>  Because of his increased popularity and visibility at Shelley's, ''[[Mixmag]]'' featured Sasha on its first cover, under the headline "SASHA MANIA - THE FIRST DJ PINUP?".<ref name="ra-feature"/>  While continuing to DJ, Sasha began to produce several of his own dance tracks.  This, he later noted, was contrary to the career paths of many successful DJs, for whom it was more common to start out as producers.<ref name="keyboard">{{Harvard reference | last=Preve | first=Francis | authorlink= | year=September 2004 | title=Spotlight: Remix summit: The avant-art of Sasha and Josh Gabriel | periodical=[[Keyboard Magazine|Keyboard]] | volume=30 | issue=9 | pages=38<U+2013>41 | id=ISSN 0730-0158 | url= }}</ref>  Upon signing a [[recording contract]], he also set up an entire [[recording studio]] at the same time, which led to a "painful learning curve" at the outset.<ref name="keyboard"/>  He released his first single, "Appolonia", under the name ''BM:Ex'' with producer [[Tom Frederikse]] on [[Union City Recordings]].  After DJing at Shelley's for several years, Sasha left his position because of increasing gang violence in and around the club.  As a result of his growing reputation, Sasha was offered work in several [[London]] and [[Australia]]n clubs.<ref name="djtimes"/>  He accepted, instead, a spot in the DJ rotation at [[Renaissance (club)|Renaissance]].  

Later in 1993, Sasha produced "Together", his first single under the name ''Sasha''.  "Together", which he produced with Danny Campbell for [[Pete Tong]]'s [[FFRR]], peaked on the [[UK Singles Chart]] at #57.  With this success, Sasha began a series of records for [[Deconstruction Records]] with the singles "Higher Ground" and "Magic" (for which Digweed performed a remix), and ''[[The Qat Collection]]'' with Frederikse and vocalist [[Sam Mollison]].<ref name="discogs-sasha">{{cite web|work=[[Discogs]] | title = Sasha |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sasha |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427063941/http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sasha |archivedate=2006-04-27}}</ref>

==Digweed era==

{{main|Sasha & John Digweed}}
In early 1993, Sasha partnered with fellow Renaissance DJ [[John Digweed]].<ref name="amg-sd"/>  Sasha and Digweed honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities.  Renaissance was pleased with their performances, and had the duo compile the triple-CD [[mix album]] ''[[Renaissance - The Mix Collection]]'', releasing it on the club's own [[Renaissance Records]] label.<ref name="djtimes"/>  The album featured tracks from such artists as [[Leftfield]], [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]], and [[2 Bad Mice]], and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed.  ''The Mix Collection'' was released soon after Sasha's departure from Renaissance in April 1994. Following his success at Renaissance, Sasha was again featured on ''Mixmag'' with the [[tagline]] "SON OF GOD?", though he resented the accolade.<ref name="lastnight">{{cite book|last = Brewster |first=Bill |title=[[Last Night a DJ Saved My Life (book)|Last Night a DJ Saved My Life]] |publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2000 |id=ISBN 0-8021-3688-5 |pages=p. 389}}</ref>  After touring together for two years, the duo became "true superstars"<ref name="amg-sd"/> with the release of their double CD ''[[Northern Exposure (album)|Northern Exposure]]'' on mega-label [[Ministry of Sound]].  Around this time, Sasha began a recurring mentorship and partnership with fellow producer [[Brian Transeau|BT]] with the album ''[[Ima]]''.<ref name="djtimes"/>  As well as providing guidance for BT, Sasha produced a "euphoric" and "introspective" 42-minute rendition of the album as a "bonus" second disc.<ref name="roughguide">{{cite book|last=Bidder|first=Sean |title=The Rough Guide to House Music| publisher = [[Rough Guides]]|year=1999 |id=ISBN 1-85828-432-5 |pages=p. 43}}</ref>  He continued to advance his own production work by pairing with vocalist [[Maria Nayler]] to produce the single "Be as One", which reached #17 on the UK singles chart.<ref name="amg-sasha">{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title= Sasha biography|work=[[All Music Guide]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:h2k0ikljbb39~T1 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

In 1997, Ministry of Sound released ''[[Northern Exposure 2]]'', Sasha and Digweed's next double-CD entry in their Northern Exposure series.  To support the album, the duo toured internationally, and in the process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s.<ref name="amg-sd"/>  After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at [[New York City]]'s famous [[Twilo]] nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night.<ref name="the-age">{{cite web|url=http://www.djsasha.com/interviews.php?nid=61 |title=Come in, spinner |date=[[2002-12-05]] |accessdate=2006-12-31 |last=Drever |first=Andrew |work = The Age, reprinted at Djsasha.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041101214415/http://www.djsasha.com/interviews.php?nid=61 |archivedate=2004-11-01}}</ref>  In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the [[Boxed]] label, as part of the [[Global Underground]] series: Digweed's ''[[Global Underground 006: Sydney]]'', and Sasha's ''[[Global Underground 009: San Francisco]]'', which drew from his experience touring on the [[West Coast of the United States]].  Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started [[Bedrock Records]].  Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency "Excession: The Agency LTD."  Excession remains a [[booking agency]] for many DJs, including [[Hybrid (producers)|Hybrid]], [[Nick Warren]], and [[Steve Lawler]].<ref name="excession">{{web cite|title=Record Labels: Excession|url= http://www.residentadvisor.net/label_view.asp?id=40 |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050209140740/http://www.residentadvisor.net/label_view.asp?id=40 |archivedate=2005-02-09 |work = [[Resident Advisor]]}}</ref>  

Sasha reached a more mainstream audience with his remixes of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]" and [[GusGus]]'s "Purple" for those artists' single releases.  His success in pop music led him to [[Film score|score]] the music for the [[PlayStation]] [[video game]] ''[[Wipeout 3]]''.<ref name="djmixed-wipeout">{{cite web|work=DJMixed.com |title=Scoring with Sasha: Interview with [[Rockstar Games]] and [[Psygnosis]] | url = http://www.djmixed.com/djmixed/newsandfeatures/article.cfm?Article_ID=1029 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060428002932/http://www.djmixed.com/djmixed/newsandfeatures/article.cfm?Article_ID=1029 |archivedate= 2006-04-28}}</ref>  In 1999, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third edition in the Northern Exposure series, ''[[Northern Exposure: Expeditions]]''.<ref name="amg-sd"/>  In addition to mixing and DJing, Sasha joined [[Charlie May]] of [[Spooky]] to produce the ''[[Xpander EP]]'',<ref name="amg-spooky">{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Sean |title=Spooky biography |work=[[All Music Guide]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:otdqoauabijr~T1 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> the [[title track]] of which many clubbers still view as "one of the greatest trance tracks of all time".<ref name="manual">{{cite book|last=Snoman|first=Rick |title=Dance Music Manual: Toys, Tools, and Techniques |publisher=Focus Press| year=2004|id=ISBN 0-240-51915-9 |pages=p. 142}}</ref>  He used the title track as a centerpiece for ''[[Global Underground 013: Ibiza]]'', his second Global Underground release.  Sasha continued his collaborations with BT on the track "Ride", which was released as a single on [[Yoshitoshi Records]] and on BT's ''[[Movement in Still Life]]''.  Soon after, he worked with [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s [[Darren Emerson]] on the single "Scorchio", Sasha's first charting single in four years.  In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album ''[[Communicate (mix album)|Communicate]]'' in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States.  ''Communicate'' had mixed reviews: ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' stated that despite a "few stellar moments, [''Communicate''] is ultimately a let-down".  [[LAUNCHcast]], too, described ''Communicate'' as "boring and lackluster<U+2026>stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats".<ref name=launch>{{cite web|title=Communicate|publisher= [[LAUNCHcast]]|date=[[2000-12-07]]|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12030996 |accessdate=2006-12-31 |last = Micallef |first = Ken |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051129202659/http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12030996 |archivedate = 2005-11-29}}</ref>

During the late 1990s, the increased popularity and visibility of "superstar DJs" led to the creation of [[superclub]]s such as Liverpool's [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream]] and Sheffield's [[Gatecrasher]].  By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished.  ''[[The Guardian]]'''s pop critic, Alexis Petridis, attributed the "terminal decline" of dance music to its over-commercialisation by big-name DJs, such as Sasha, and to their demands for increased fees for performances.<ref name="petridis">{{cite web|last=Petridis |first=Alexis |title=Cynical, exploitative and banking on ecstasy to mask the rip-off |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2003-08-21]]| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/feature/0,,1026502,00.html |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  Though dance music had been declared "dead" by many in the dance industry, Sasha continued to tour<U+2014>despite the closing of many superclubs, including his resident club Twilo in May 2001.<ref name="gillan">{{cite web|last=Gillan |first=Audrey|title=Super DJs forced off the dancefloor |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2003-08-21]] | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1026308,00.html |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

In 2004, Sasha signed with [[Global Underground]] to produce another mix album.  However, he found the process of creating a standard mix album unrewarding,<ref name="lacitybeat-build">{{cite web|last=Romero |first=Dennis |title=Building a Better DJ |work=Los Angeles CityBeat |date=[[2004-06-24]] |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1018&IssueNum=55 |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051231090100/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1018&IssueNum=55 |archivedate = 2005-12-31}}</ref> and decided to apply his production and DJing skills to a mix compilation that resembled a "real" album<U+2014>that is, one featuring original material.<ref name="bbc-wales"/>  Sasha's next studio album, ''[[Involver]]'', was "a fusion of mix album and [[Wiktionary:production record|production record]]", consisting entirely of Sasha's reworkings of tracks by other artists.<ref name="amg-sasha"/>  "I tried to take all the separate sounds to all the tracks [and recombine them]", he later explained, "and it allowed me to mix the tracks together on a much deeper level."<ref name="sfweekly">{{cite web|last=Reeves |first=Mosi |title=Don't Speak: A man of few words, dance music hero Sasha talks with his hands |work=[[Houston Press]]|date=[[2004-10-07]] |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/Issues/2004-10-07/music/music2.html |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050915224045/http://www.houstonpress.com/Issues/2004-10-07/music/music2.html |archivedate = 2005-09-15}}</ref>  He accomplished this by [[Music sequencer|sequencing]] the album using [[Ableton Live]]<ref name="apple">{{cite web|last=Schaal |first=Tilmann |title=DJ Sasha: Crossfade into the Digital Domain |publisher=[[Apple Computer|Apple.com]] |url=http://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/sasha/ |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> and [[Logic Pro]].<ref name="lacitybeat-build"/>  Ableton Live is a [[music loop]]-based software package that Sasha uses to engineer tracks in real-time, whereas he used Logic Pro primarily for premeditated edits to audio tracks.

In 2005, Sasha produced his next album, ''[[Fundacion NYC]]'', based on his nights DJing in New York at the Fundacion club.  ''Fundacion NYC'' received positive reviews for its originality, though ''[[JIVE Magazine]]'' found it "too complicated for the ear".<ref name="jive-fundacion">{{cite web |title=Sasha - Fundacion|work=[[JIVE Magazine]] |date=[[2006-06-22]] |url=http://www.jivemagazine.com/review.php?rid=1103&rtid=2 |accessdate=2006-12-31 |last=Jewels }}</ref>  Sasha is pleased with the album, and plans to make a series of Fundacion albums.<ref name="groovetickets">{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Zel |title=One More Time: Interview with Sasha |work= Groovetickets.com |date=[[2005-05-31]] |url=http://www.groovetickets.com/bz_art_new.asp?DID=857 |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051119072006/http://www.groovetickets.com/bz_art_new.asp?DID=857 |archivedate = 2005-11-19}}</ref>  The next year, Sasha released 10,000&nbsp;copies of a June 2006 DJ set for sale using [[Instant Live]], making him the first DJ to use Instant Live's licensing and publishing services.<ref name="billboard-live">{{cite web|last=Paoletta |first=Michael |title=Sasha Plans Live DJ Mixes |work= [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |date=[[2006-05-24]] |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002574682 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  While continuing to regularly DJ, Sasha is working on material to produce another ''Involver'' mix and the next ''Fundacion'' mix.<ref name="4clubbers>{{cite web|last=Woodcock |first=Clare |work=4clubbers.net| title= Interviews: Sasha |accessdate=2006-12-31 |url=http://www.4clubbers.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=572}}</ref>  ''Global Underground'' announced that Sasha's ''Involver 2'' will be released in 2007.<ref name="gu-19">{{cite web|url = http://www.globalunderground.co.uk/addyMail/19/ |title=Global Underground Newsflash |publisher = [[Global Underground]] |accessdate=2006-12-31|year=2006}}</ref>

==Musical genres==
[[image:Sasha2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sasha performing [[July 8]], [[2006]] in [[Bucharest, Romania]], playing [[electro-house]].]]
Influenced by the early sound of The Ha<U+00E7>ienda, Sasha began his career playing records of the rough, danceable genre of acid house.  By the early 1990s, he had moved towards a more dark European [[house music]] style, though by the time of his Shelley's residency he had begun to experiment more with American house.  His tastes further developed as he moved to Renaissance, and he began to incorporate the pop-based sounds of [[Moby]], [[Spooky]], and [[Leftfield]].  Sasha's second Digweed collaboration, 1997's ''Northern Exposure'', was described as "epic house",<ref name="djtimes"/> and subsequent releases featured the spacey and atmospheric [[progressive trance]] sound of artists such as [[Sven V<U+00E4>th]], [[Matt Darey]], [[Tilt (producers)|Tilt]], and [[Armin Van Buuren]].  A rhythmic and bassy [[progressive house]] influence distinguished his ''Xpander EP'' and the mix albums of the late 1990s.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite book|editor=[[Nathan Brackett]]|publisher=Fireside |id=ISBN 0-7432-0169-8 |pages=p. 718 |title=[[Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|edition=4th Edition|year=2004|pages=p. 718}}</ref>  At the time, Sasha's music rotation included records by artists such as [[Space Manoeuvres]], BT, and [[Breeder (producers)|Breeder]], and [[Sander Kleinenberg]]'s single "My Lexicon".

With the 2000 album ''Communicate'', the duo's work moved towards a deeper and darker house music sound. The album featured tracks by [[Richard Morel|Morel]], [[James Holden (producer)|Mainline]], and [[Jimmy Van M]].  The focus shifted from the melodic themes of previous releases in favour of a stronger emphasis on the bassline.<ref name="rollingstone"/>  The Delta Heavy Tour and ''[[Airdrawndagger]]'' marked a dramatic shift in style, and reflected the influences of relaxed [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[breakbeat]] music on Sasha's work.  These influences inspired the <!-- "artist" --> album's strong melodies, occasional breakbeat loops, and limited use of percussion.  ''Involver'' was primarily a fusion of the musical style of house music characterised by [[UNKLE]] and [[Lostep]].  With 2005's ''Fundacion'', Sasha's style was mostly progressive house and [[electro-house]] music, with work by [[James Holden (producer)|James Holden]], [[Tiefschwarz]], and [[Swayzak]].<ref name="PS-fundacion"/>  With his success in progressive house, Sasha has commented that he feels people try to "pigeon-hole" him into playing that genre.  Rather than calling it progressive house, Sasha considers his most recent material to be between house, trance, and breaks,<ref name="kidzworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/site/p2584.htm |title=DJ/Producer Sasha Interview |accessdate=2006-12-31 |work=Kidzworld |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051228175551/http://www.kidzworld.com/site/p2584.htm |archivedate = 2005-12-28}}</ref> though he has stated that he prefers not to associate himself with a specific genre of music.

==Techniques and technology==
Sasha attributes his success to his technical skill and ability to "connect with his dancers".<ref name="lastnight"/>  During performances, he balances new and experimental  material, while ensuring that "the party is still rockin".<ref name="newsweek"/>  His spontaneity carries over to studio work; he typically has only a vague idea of the track listing when beginning work on a new mix album.<ref name="fundint">{{cite web|first=Ben |last=Blue |title=Sasha - Fundacion NYC Interview |url=http://dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/SashaFundInt.htm |accessdate=2006-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060501230744/http://dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/SashaFundInt.htm |archivedate=2006-05-01}}</ref>  Because of this, his albums never turn out quite as he expects.<ref name="fundint"/>
[[Image:Sasha front1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sasha using [[Ableton Live]] at a [[15 July]] [[2006]] performance at Panama, an [[Amsterdam]] nightclub.]]
Sasha is known for applying new music technologies to both his studio and live work.  Both Sasha and Digweed used Pro Tools on [[Macintosh]] computers when mixing their compilation albums, and used turntables and records during live performances.  For their remixes, however, they used an [[Atari ST]]<U+2014>an obsolete [[personal computer]] from the early 1990s<U+2014>with [[Notator]], a [[music sequencer]] used for arranging audio tracks.<ref name="remix">{{cite book|last=Gerrish |first=Bruce |title=Remix: The Electronic Music Explosion |publisher=ArtistPro |year=2001 |pages=pp. 65, 127<U+2013>133}}</ref>  For more recent albums such as ''Fundacion NYC'', Sasha used an Ableton Live for sequencing, partially because of Pro Tools' higher price.<ref name="djfix"/>  In live performances up to the late 1990s, Sasha performed exclusively using records. Before he started using the [[CDJ1000]], a "turntable" used for CDs, he had his digital music specially cut to [[acetate disc|acetate records]] before each tour.<ref name="washingtonpost"/>  Once he integrated CDs into his live act, Sasha operated CDJ1000s with [[Allen & Heath]] mixers and [[FireworX]].<ref name="virgin"/>  While he is now known for heavily utilizing audio technologies, Sasha was one of the last DJs to begin using CDs in live performance.

Sasha began DJing with Ableton Live in his live act as well, using it in tandem with turntables.  Having explored its functionality, Sasha found that he could perform entirely through Ableton Live.  He then co-developed the ''Maven'' [[MIDI controller|controller]] with Ableton, which he uses as a physical interface to the Live software.<ref name="fundint"/><ref name="ps-sashainterview"/>  (DJing with a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] alone, he has said, is "not going to look right or feel right".)<ref name="keyboard"/>  ''Fundacion NYC'' was the first album on which he regularly used the Maven controller.<ref name="djmixed-fundacion">{{cite web|title=Sasha Fundacionnyc Mix |work=DJMixed.com |url=http://www.djmixed.com/djmixed/newsandfeatures/article.cfm?Article_ID=3326 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  During DJ sets, clubbers often believe Sasha is playing new, unheard remixes; in fact, he is often playing modifications of tracks created in Ableton.<ref name="apple"/>  Sasha most often uses the built-in Ableton [[plugin]]s, preferring their superior stability and performance over third party plugins.<ref name="fundint"/>  For the first public performance of ''Involver'' material, he used a [[PowerBook]] running Ableton,<ref name="macworld">{{cite web|title=DJ Sasha talks Macs and Ableton |work=[[Macworld]] |accessdate=2006-12-31 |url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=15061&Page=1&pagePos=2 |date=[[2006-06-26]]}}</ref> but has since shifted to a setup that includes an [[iMac G5]] and Ableton Live.<ref name="apple"/>  Despite Sasha's insistence that Ableton Live allows for greater creativity and spontaneity, "vinyl purists" have accused him of taking much of the challenge and mystique out of DJing by using software in performances.<ref name="prefix"/>

The [[Internet]] has greatly changed how Sasha obtains and uses tracks for performance. While he once hunted through record shops for new records, Sasha now regularly receives new tracks from producers and labels via the Internet.<ref name="ps-sashainterview"/>  These tracks, which number in the hundreds each week, are edited by Sasha and others for use in his live DJ sets.<ref name="ps-sashainterview"/>
