The '''Calapooya Mountains''' are a short [[mountain range]] in southwestern [[Oregon]] in the [[United States]]. The range runs for approximately {{convert|60|mi}} west from the [[Cascade Range]] between [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] on the north and [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] on the south.<ref>{{cite gnis| type = | id = 1157845| name = Calapooya Mountains| accessdate = 2009-04-10|date = 28-Nov-1980 }}</ref>

== Geology ==

The Calapooya Mountains are composed of volcanic rocks and newer sedimentary strata.  The mountains have been deeply eroded by the [[Coast Fork Willamette River]] and its tributaries.  In the southern drainage, the tributaries of the North Umpqua River have cut into the southern slopes. The soil is silty, clay loam formed from sandstone, sediment, and igneous rocks.<ref name="SWC">[http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/NRD/docs/pdf/plans/sowlmt_04_pln.pdf ''Southern Willamette Valley Agricultural Water Quality Management Area Plan''], Southern Willamette Valley Local Advisory Committee, East Lane Soil and Water Conservation District, Oregon Department of Agriculture, Eugene, Oregon, 23 December 2004.</ref>

== Topography ==

The Calapooya Mountains and the '''Calapooya Divide''' are two parts of a spur of the [[Western Cascades|Western Cascade]] mountains in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] that form the divide between the [[drainage basin|watershed]]s of the [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[Umpqua River|Umpqua]] rivers. At its southeastern end, the spur joins the [[Cascade Range]] near Cowhorn Mountain near the headwaters of the [[Middle Fork Willamette River]] and the [[North Umpqua River]]. A [[Topography|topographic]] map in the ''Atlas of Oregon'' shows the Calapooya Mountains curving northwest from near Potter, McGowan, and Balm mountains past Bohemia Mountain to Holland Point, south of [[Oakridge, Oregon|Oakridge]]. From near Bohemia Mountain, a block of mountains connected to the Calapooya Mountains runs runs due west along the border between [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane]] and [[Douglas County, Oregon|Douglas]] counties to the vicinity of [[Interstate 5]] (I-5) near [[Rice Hill, Oregon|Rice Hill]]. This block is known as the Calapooya Divide. To the north along I-5 are [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] and to the  south are [[Sutherlin, Oregon|Sutherlin]] and [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]].<ref name = "Loy">Loy, pp. 264&ndash;65</ref>

Streams flowing south from the Calapooyas into the North Umpqua River include Steamboat, Canton, and Rock creeks, while Calapooya Creek flows west from the divide into the Umpqua main stem. Streams flowing north or east into the Middle Fork Willamette River include Tumblebug, Staley, Coal, and Packard creeks. Flowing northwest or west into the [[Coast Fork Willamette River]] or its major tributary, the [[Row River]], are Brice, Layng, and Mosby creeks and [[Big River (Oregon)|Big River]]. The Umpqua flows west through the [[Oregon Coast Range]] to the Pacific Ocean at [[Reedsport, Oregon|Reedsport]], while the Willamette flows north to the [[Columbia River]], which flows northwest to the Pacific Ocean at [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]].<ref name = "Loy"/>

The highest peaks in the range include Balm Mountain at {{convert|6165|ft|m}} above [[sea level]], Potter Mountain at {{convert|6145|ft|m}}, and McGowan Mountain at {{convert|6130|ft|m}}, all near the southeastern end of the range. Along the divide, Huckleberry Mountain in the east rises to {{convert|4754|ft|m}}, while Ben More Mountain near I-5 is only {{convert|2480|ft|m}} high. Bohemia Mountain and its close neighbor Fairview Peak reach identical peak elevations of {{convert|5933|ft|m}}, while Holland Point near Oakridge is {{convert|5048|ft|m}} high.<ref name = "Loy"/>

== Climate ==

The climate in the Calapooya Mountains follows a pattern of wet winters and dry summers. Precipitation generally increases with elevation, ranging from an average of {{convert|40|to|50|in|mm}} per year in the valleys to {{convert|70|to|80|in|mm}} on the mountain peaks. Above {{convert|4000|ft|m}}, a significant part of this falls as snow.<ref name="SWC"/>

== History ==

Throughout the history of the region the range has provided a geographic and cultural barrier between the [[Willamette Valley]]  and the [[South Umpqua Valley]], effectively separating [[Western Oregon]] from [[Southern Oregon]]. In the 19th century, it separated the tribal domains of the [[Kalapuya]] and [[Coquille (tribe)|Coquille]] tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], both of which ceded their lands to the U.S. government in the 1854 [[Kalapuya Treaty]]. During the 1840s the mountains became an inconvenient barrier for white settlers seeking to move into southern Oregon or to move southward to the [[California gold rush|California gold fields]]. The [[Applegate Trail]], blazed in the late 1840s provided the first reliable path for white settlement through the western end of the mountains.  [[Interstate 5]] essentially follows the route of the trail between Eugene and Roseburg.

The mountains have been an important [[timber industry|timber]] source in the 20th century. The eastern end of the mountains are largely within the [[Umpqua National Forest]] and [[Willamette National Forest]].
