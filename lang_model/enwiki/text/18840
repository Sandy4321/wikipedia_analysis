'''Hurricane Edith''' was the strongest [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] to form during the [[1971 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It developed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Edith [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] on September 9 and made landfall on [[Cape Gracias a Dios]] as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the [[Gulf of Honduras]] it crossed the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] in Mexico. After moving across the [[Gulf of Mexico]] a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on [[Louisiana]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) on September 16. Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on September 18.

The hurricane killed two people when it passed near [[Aruba]]. Striking northeastern Central America as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35&nbsp;people. In [[Texas]] high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. One tornado, rated F3 on the [[Fujita Scale]], damaged several homes and injured multiple people in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida, of which a few destroyed entire buildings. Damage in the United States totaled $25&nbsp;million (1971&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], $125&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Edith 1971 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of Africa near [[Dakar]] on August 31. It moved westward into the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west,<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=R. H. Simpson, John Hope, & Neil Frank|year=1972|title=Atlantic hurricane season of 1971|publisher=National Hurricane Center & National Weather Service|accessdate=2006-11-01|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1971.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40<U+00B0> W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.<ref name="tcr1">{{cite web|author=John Hope|year=1971|title=Hurricane Edith Preliminary Report Page 1|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1971-prelim/edith/prelim01.gif}}</ref> The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a [[Hurricane Hunters|reconnaissance flight]] that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255&nbsp;miles (415&nbsp;km) east of [[Grenada]].<ref name="mwr"/>

The depression moved westward quickly, and moved through the southern [[Lesser Antilles]] early on September 6. The southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern [[Venezuela]], though after entering the [[Caribbean Sea]], another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm the existence of a low-level circulation.<ref name="tcr1"/> Shortly thereafter, while moving into an area of light [[wind shear]], it was able to organize and strengthen further, and on September 7 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm ''[[Edith]]'' near the island of [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]]. While initially, a cold-core upper-level [[low pressure area|low]] persisted about 750&nbsp;miles (1200&nbsp;km) northwest of the storm, Edith moved west-northwestward due to the influence of a narrow and persistent [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge of high pressure]], which extended from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As the storm continued into open waters of the Caribbean, the upper-level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an [[anticyclone]]. This allowed the storm to strengthen further, and on September 8, Edith became a hurricane in the south-central Caribbean Sea.<ref name="mwr"/>

On September 9, the storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]], and within 24&nbsp;hours, Edith strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a powerful 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 hurricane]] just off the coast of [[Nicaragua]]. The cause for the explosive deepening is unknown, though it is speculated that the transformation in the upper troposphere from an upper-level low to an anticyclone led to a release of [[baroclinity|baroclinic]] energy. Reconnaissance aircraft crews in the peak of the storm reported extreme turbulence, causing concern for the safety of the crews. At its peak intensity, the very well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|"pinhole" eye]] was only 5&nbsp;miles (8&nbsp;km) in diameter. Late on September 9, Hurricane Edith made landfall on northeastern [[Nicaragua]] at [[Cabo Gracias a Dios]].<ref name="mwr"/>

Hurricane Edith rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18&nbsp;hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the [[Gulf of Honduras]] as an 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]]. It continued to weaken as it moved northwestward, and made landfall near [[Belize City]] with [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm winds]] of 70&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], and emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] near [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche, Mexico]] late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of [[wind shear]] and warm waters.<ref name="mwr"/> This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with [[Hurricane Fern (1971)|Hurricane Fern]], which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating [[tropical cyclogenesis|conditions not conducive for intensification]].<ref name="tcr4">{{cite web|author=John Hope|year=1971|title=Hurricane Edith Preliminary Report Page 4|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1971-prelim/edith/prelim04.gif}}</ref> As Fern moved inland over [[Texas]], the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36&nbsp;hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.<ref name="mwr"/>

Edith continued moving to the west-northwest, heading towards the coast of Mexico, but early on September 14, the storm stalled while located just off the coast of [[Tamaulipas]]. A mid-latitude [[trough (meteorology)|trough of low pressure]] approached the storm, and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast. Located only miles from the Mexican coast, Edith again failed to strengthen until September 15, when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of [[Louisiana]], and made landfall on September 16 in a sparsely populated area 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) east of [[Cameron, Louisiana|Cameron]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h), equivalent to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane in the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Edith rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana, and into a tropical depression over [[Mississippi]]. It continued to the east-northeast, and dissipated over northwestern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on September 18.<ref name="mwr"/>

==Preparations==
Fourteen hours prior to Edith making landfall in Central America, the [[National Hurricane Center]] warned citizens about the extreme danger of the approaching hurricane, and asked them to prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Hurricane Warning|Hurricane Warning]] from [[Cameron, Louisiana|Cameron]] to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.<ref name="tcr6">{{cite web|author=John Hope|year=1971|title=Hurricane Edith Preliminary Report Page 2|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1971-prelim/edith/prelim02.gif}}</ref>

In [[Belize]], officials ordered the mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas, resulting in hundreds of residents leaving to the United States through the international airport. Officials sent police troops to maintain order and prevent looting.<ref name="belizeupi">{{cite web|author=United Press International|publishdate=1971-09-11|title=Honduras town in hurricane path evacuated|accessdate=2006-11-01|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=48701846&firstvisit=true&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref>

In the [[Gulf of Mexico]], several oil facilities were closed or placed on automatic controls. [[Drilling rig]]s as far east as the coastal waters off of [[Mississippi]] were prepared to evacuate in the event Edith moved further east than anticipated. Additionally, thousands evacuated coastal areas of [[Louisiana]] prior to the arrival of the hurricane. Several shelters opened in coastal cities, and many people [[hurricane preparedness|prepared for the hurricane]] by purchasing emergency supplies. Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana.<ref name="916ap">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|publishdate=1971-09-16|title=Thousands flee Hurricane Edith|accessdate=2006-11-01|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=35152838&firstvisit=true&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref>

==Impact==
===Caribbean===

Despite the damage caused, and the hurricane's intensity, the name Edith was not [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]]. Edith was one of only four Category&nbsp;5 hurricanes, and the only one named that made landfall as such, that did not have its name retired.
