'''''Phases and Stages''''' is a 1974 album by [[Willie Nelson]], which followed the moderate success of his first [[Atlantic Records]] release, ''[[Shotgun Willie]]''. Nelson met producer [[Jerry Wexler]] at a party where Nelson sang songs from an unreleased album he had recorded in 1972. The single "Phases and Stages" was originally recorded the same year. Nelson re-recorded the album at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studios]] in two days and Wexler produced it.

The album narrates the story of a divorce. Side one tells the woman's story and side two the man's. Released on March 1974, the album peaked at number 34 on [[Billboard charts|''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Country Albums]] and the single "Bloody Mary Morning" reached number 17 on [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard''{{'}}s Country singles]]. Despite the chart positions attained by the album, and its singles, Atlantic Records closed their Country music division in September 1974.

==Background and Recording==
In 1972, Nelson signed a recording contract with the Country Music division of [[Atlantic Records]] and Jerry Wexler, who gave Nelson greater creative control than his previous contract.{{sfn|Kienzle, Richard|2003|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=NnQrKtq_JV4C&lpg=PA251&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false 251]}}{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2008|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=KCmNqTTKiyAC&lpg=PA120&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false 120]}} Nelson met Wexler at a party in [[Harlan Howard]]'s house, where he sang the songs Nelson wrote for an album. Nelson recorded his first album for Atlantic Records, ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'', in 1972.{{sfn|Kienzle, Richard|2003|pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=NnQrKtq_JV4C&lpg=PA251&dq=%22Shotgun%20Willie%22&pg=PA250#v=onepage&q&f=false 250], [http://books.google.com/books?id=NnQrKtq_JV4C&lpg=PA251&dq=%22Shotgun%20Willie%22&pg=PA251#v=onepage&q&f=false 251]}} ''Shotgun Willie'', produced by [[Arif Mardin]] and Wexler, marked a change of style in Nelson's music. Nelson stated that recording the album had "...cleared his throat".{{sfn|Tichi, Cecilia|1998|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=p_gYzRsNNbEC&dq=Tichi+1998&q=cleared+his+throat#v=onepage&q=cleared%20his%20throat&f=false 341]}}

The single "Phases and Stages" was first released in 1972. Nelson had previously recorded the album ''Phases and Stages'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&lpg=PA227&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA227#v=onepage&q&f=false 227], [http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&lpg=PA227&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA228#v=onepage&q&f=false 228]}} In 1973, Nelson re-recorded the songs in two days at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] for Atlantic Records with musicians [[David Hood]], [[Barry Beckett]], [[Jimmy Johnson (musician)|Jimmy Johnson]], [[Pete Carr]] and Robert Hawkins. Atlantic Records' executives criticized Wexler's decision to record in Muscle Shoals instead of [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="Atlantic">{{cite album-notes| title =Complete Atlantic Sessions| artist = Willie Nelson|year =2006|format= CD|publisher=Atlantic/Rhino|author=Wexler, Jerry}}</ref> Wexler later stated: "They said Muscle Shoals was too R&B for Willie.

==Concept==
The album's theme is one of divorce, which it narrates from both partner's viewpoints. That of the woman is narrated on side one; that of the man on side two. The recurrent song "Phases and Stages", is repeated throughout the album, and introduces the other songs.

The album starts with "Phases and Stages/Washing the Dishes", where the woman is tired of caring for her unfaithful husband, emphasizing the activity of washing dishes. The song is followed by "Phases and Stages/Walkin'" where, after consideration, she leaves her husband at night and comments: "Walking is better than running". In "Pretend I Never Happened", the woman advises her husband to forget her and continue with his life. In "Sister's Coming Home/Down at the Corner Beer Joint" the woman's younger sister describes the subject's grief; the woman sleeps through daylight hours trying to forget her husband. In the part, the female narrator overcomes her feelings and returns to her social life at the corner of a bar, representing her liberation with the lyric "...(with) her jeans fitting tighter than they did before". The final song of side one depicts the woman falling in love again but still reluctant to admit it because she fears that her story will be repeated.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&lpg=PA227&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA227#v=onepage&q&f=false 227], [http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&lpg=PA227&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA228#v=onepage&q&f=false 228]}}

The second side of the album begins with "Bloody Mary Morning", where the male narrator orders drinks on a flight from [[Los Angeles, California]] to [[Houston, Texas]] after his wife unexpectedly left him. In "Phases and Stages/No Love Around" and "I Still Can't Believe You're Gone"  the man realizes the true impact of her disappearance on his life. "It's Not Supposed to Be That Way" reflects his inability to accept the situation and his grief. In "Heaven and Hell", the man expresses his inability to live without his wife, with the lyric: "Sometimes is heaven, sometimes is hell, and sometimes I don't even know." the final track is "Phases and Stages/Pick Up the Tempo/Phases and Stages", in which the man reveals his inability to change his character, and accepts his nature.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

Despite the moderate success of Nelson's singles, Atlantic Records' executives were unhappy with Nelson's style, and closed their Country Music division in September 1974. Wexler protested to [[Ahmet Ertegun|Ahmet]] and [[Nesuhi Ertegun]], arguing that Atlantic had Willie Nelson. The Ertegun brothers replied "Willie Who? Go ahead and close it." Following the division's closure, Wexler resigned.{{sfn|Reid, Jan; Sahm, Shawn|2010|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=1gry61absiEC&lpg=PA127&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA127#v=onepage&q&f=false 127]}} The album sold 400,000 copies, and Nelson was released from his Atlantic contract, prompting [[Columbia Records]]' executives to offer Nelson a contract giving him complete creative control of his works.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2008|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=KCmNqTTKiyAC&lpg=PA120&dq=%22phases%20and%20stages%22%20willie%20nelson&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false 120]}}<ref name="NW"/> Wexler later described ''Phases and Stages'' and ''Shotgun Willie'' as "...generally viewed as having set Willie on a new path ... it was the coalescing of his audience, where the rednecks and the hippies came together. And to this day, that's Willie's audience."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060730/FEATURES/607300539|title=Soul Man|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=July 30, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2011|author=Harmon, Rod|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref>

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote for ''[[Allmusic]]'': "...the deceptively relaxed arrangements, including the occasional strings, not only highlight Nelson's clever eclecticism, but they also heighten the emotional impact of the album. [...] As a result, this is not just one of Willie Nelson's best records, but one of the great concept albums overall".<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/phases-and-stages-r93334/review|title=Phases and Stages <U+2013> Willie Nelson|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>
