===Olympic career===
In 1996, after high school, Hawn qualified to live at the [[Olympic Training Center]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado.<ref name="Hawnprofile" />  There he trained judo for eight years and ultimately qualified for the [[2004 Olympic Games]].<ref name="Hawnprofile" />  At the Games in 2004, Hawn went 2-2 and finished in 9th place. Hawn also won numerous medals at U.S. national championships and two medals at the Pan American Games.<ref name="Hawnprofile" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usjudo.org/seniors_bioRHawn.asp|title=U.S. Judo profile}}</ref>

After the 2004 games, Hawn moved to Boston to train with bronze medalist [[Jimmy Pedro]].<ref name="Hawnprofile" /> However, Hawn failed to make the 2008 Olympic judo team.<ref name="Hawnprofile" />  Soon after, Hawn began training for a career in [[mixed martial arts]].

==Mixed martial arts career==
===Early career===
Hawn's professional mixed martial arts debut came in January 2009 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  Hawn won by [[technical knockout]] in the first round. Over the next two years, Hawn won his next eight fights, six by [[Technical knockout|TKO]].

===Bellator Fighting Championships===
In March 2011, Hawn began competing in the [[Bellator Fighting Championships]] Season 4 welterweight tournament.  He defeated [[Jim Wallhead]] by unanimous decision in the quarterfinals and [[Lyman Good]] by split decision in the semifinals.

Hawn was defeated by [[Jay Hieron]] at [[Bellator 43]] in a fight which some believe was a controversial split decision.

After a strong showing in the Season 4 tournament, Hawn was planning to return to the cage as part of Bellator's Season 5 Welterweight tournament, but an injury during training forced him out of the tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/chris-cisneros-replaces-injured-rick-hawn-in-bellator-49-quarterfinal-bout|title=Chris Cisneros Replaces Injured Rick Hawn in Bellator 49 Quarterfinal Bout|publisher=MMAWeekly.com|date=August 20, 2011}}</ref>

Hawn returned to the promotion in the spring of 2012 as a participant in the [[Bellator_Fighting_Championships:_Season_Six#Lightweight_tournament_bracket|Season Six Lightweight Tournament]]; dropping down to 155 for the first time in his MMA career.  He faced Ricardo Tirloni in the opening round at [[Bellator 62]]. Tirloni was able to land with a few leg kicks, but Hawn was able to continue pressing forward. Hawn then landed a right hand which dropped Tirloni. Hawn hit Tirloni with punches and hammerfists on the ground and the fight was stopped at 2:36 of the opening round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Woodard-Hawn-Weedman-Silva-Punch-Semifinal-Tickets-at-Bellator-62-41321|title=Woodard, Hawn, Weedman, Silva punch semi-final tickets at Bellator 62|publisher=sherdog.com|date=March 23, 2012}}</ref>

He next faced [[Lloyd Woodard]] in the semifinals at [[Bellator 66]] on April 20, 2012. Hawn won the fight via KO in the second round. Hawn next took on [[Brent Weedman]] in the tournament finals on May 25, 2012 at [[Bellator 70]] in New Orleans, LA. He won the fight via unanimous decision.

At [[Bellator 95]], Hawn faced [[Karo Parisyan]] whom Hawn had twice defeated in Judo competition.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://bostonherald.com/2010/02/olympic_judoka_rick_hawn_takes_cage | 
title=Olympic Judoka Rick Hawn takes to the cage | publisher=Boston Herald | date=2009 | accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref> During the bout, Hawn was able to land a right cross knocking Parisyan to his knees and landed repeated hammerfists on Parisyan prompting the fight to be stopped 1:55 into the second round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Bellator-95-Results-Live-PlaybyPlay-Updates-51319#karo-parisyan-rick-hawn| title=BELLATOR 95 RESULTS: LIVE PLAY-BY-PLAY & UPDATES|date=April 4, 2013}}</ref>

In the fall of 2013, Hawn entered his second Bellator Welterweight tournament.  He defeated both [[Brent Weedman]] and [[Herman Terrado]] by unanimous decision in the semifinals and quarterfinals, respectively.

In the finals Hawn faced [[Ron Keslar]] and won via knockout in the third round.

Hawn will now face [[Douglas Lima]] for the vacant Bellator Welterweight title at a yet-to-be-determined event in 2014.
