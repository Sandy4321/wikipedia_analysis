{{DISPLAYTITLE:''News of the World'' phone hacking scandal investigations}}
The '''''News of the World'' phone hacking scandal investigations''' followed the revelations in 2005 of voicemail interception on behalf of ''[[News of the World]]''. Despite wider evidence of wrongdoing, the [[News of the World royal phone hacking scandal]] appeared resolved with the 2007 conviction of the ''News of the World'' royal editor [[Clive Goodman]] and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, and the resignation of editor [[Andy Coulson]]. However, a series of civil legal cases and investigations by newspapers, parliament and the police ultimately saw evidence of "industrial scale" phone hacking, leading to the closure of the ''News of the World'' on 10 July 2011. However, the affair did not end there, developing into the [[News International phone hacking scandal|News Corporation ethics scandal]] as wrongdoing beyond the ''News of the World'' (including the United States) and beyond phone hacking (including paying police for information) came to light.

==Civil legal cases==
The [[News of the World royal phone hacking scandal]] had raised evidence of victims being targeted outside the Royal Family, but this evidence did not lead to criminal proceedings. In lieu of criminal proceedings, several public figures commenced litigation against the ''News of the World'''s owner News International and against the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Those who began legal action included the football agent [[Sky Andrew]], actress [[Sienna Miller]], actor [[Steve Coogan]], television presenter [[Chris Tarrant]] and football pundit [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]].<ref name="keypeople">{{Cite news|title=Phone hacking probe: Key people|publisher=BBC News|date=27 December 2010|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12296392|accessdate=28 January 2011}}{{Verify source|date=July 2011}}</ref> In December 2009, footballer [[Sol Campbell]] instructed his solicitor to contact the police in response to various media reports.<ref name=Indp1835028/> The Max Clifford case, which in early 2010 had appeared to make likely the disclosure of previously secret ''News of the World'' documents, was settled out of court in March 2010, keeping the documents secret. The next month, reports of further legal action against the ''News of the World'' emerged. Those considering litigation against the paper included a football agent and ten MPs. The legal action re-opened the possibility of details emerging that the settlement with Clifford had kept secret.<ref>''[[The Observer]]'', 25 April 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/25/andy-coulson-phone-bug-claim New claims of phone hacking put pressure on Andy Coulson]</ref>

===Max Clifford case, 2010===
In March 2010 the ''News of the World'' settled out-of-court a case brought against it by publicist [[Max Clifford]] for intercepting his voicemail. After a lunch with Rebekah Brooks, the paper agreed to pay Clifford's legal fees and an undisclosed "personal payment" not described as damages, with the sum exceeding <U+00A3>1 million. The money was paid in exchange for Clifford giving the ''News of the World'' exclusive stories over the next several years.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05hacking-t.html |title=Tabloid Hack Attack on Royals, and Beyond|date=1 September 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2011 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="evans10">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/03/news-of-the-world-phone-hacking|title=News of the World loses battle over secret phone hacking evidence|last=Evans|first=Rob|date=3 February 2010|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref>

The case had been expected to reveal the details of previous settlements the paper had made, including the <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million spent in 2009, settling with three phone hacking victims, and the unfair dismissal claim won by Clive Goodman.<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 March 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/09/clifford-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking Max Clifford drops News of the World phone hacking action in <U+00A3>1m deal]</ref> Clifford had won court rulings in February earlier that year that meant that the ''News of the World'' would have had to disclose previously secret information regarding which journalists were involved in hacking voicemail messages. A judge ruled that Glenn Mulcaire had to disclose the names of all the journalists who targeted Clifford and also those who received transcripts of the messages.<ref name="evans10">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/03/news-of-the-world-phone-hacking|title=News of the World loses battle over secret phone hacking evidence|last=Evans|first=Rob|date=3 February 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=4 February 2010 }}</ref> With the eventual settlement, however, the information was not made public.

===HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan===
A report aired on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' in October included remarks made by an unnamed source said to have been a former senior journalist at the ''News of the World'' who had worked alongside Coulson. The source alleged that Coulson had personally listened to messages obtained through phone hacking.<ref name="dispatchesallegations">{{Cite news | title = Phone-hacking scandal: Andy Coulson 'listened to intercepted messages' | work=The Guardian | date = 3 October 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/03/phone-hacking-scandal-andy-coulson | accessdate =5 October 2010| location=London| first=Nick| last=Davies}}</ref><ref name="dispatchesallegations2">{{Cite news | title = Andy Coulson listened to hacked messages, former colleague says | work=The Spy Report | publisher=Media Spy | date = 4 October 2010 | url = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/10/04/uk-andy-coulson-listened-to-hacked-messages-former-colleague-says/ | accessdate =5 October 2010}}</ref>

In December 2010, Coulson <U+2013> while under oath as a witness in ''[[HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan]]'' <U+2013> denied any knowledge of phone hacking at the ''News of the World'' or that he knew the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.<ref name="coulsonsdenies">{{Cite news | title = Andy Coulson denies phone hacking at Tommy Sheridan trial | author=Carrell, Severin | author2 = Davies, Nick |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 9 December 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/09/andy-coulson-phone-hacking-sheridan | accessdate =9 April 2011}}</ref> The following day, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] said that it had determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge Coulson over allegations that he was aware of phone hacking at the publication.

===Sienna Miller case===
New allegations about the conduct of ''News of the World'' executives emerged in December 2010. Papers lodged in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] by lawyers acting for [[Sienna Miller]] claimed to have uncovered evidence of the involvement of [[Ian Edmondson]], a senior editor at the paper, in work undertaken by Mulcaire.<ref name="edmondson">{{Cite news | title = Phone hacking approved by top News of the World executive <U+2013> new files |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 15 December 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/15/phone-hacking-sienna-miller-evidence | accessdate =12 January 2011 | first = Nick | last = Davies}}</ref>

Prescott in particular was outraged at the fact that the police did not inform him of the phone tapping, but Assistant Commissioner [[John Yates (police officer)|John Yates]] stated that there was no actual evidence that Prescott's phone had been tapped.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8143656.stm "Prescott: Police decision 'so quick'"]. [[BBC News]].</ref>

Contrary to claims made by ''News of the World'' in 2007, ''The Guardian'' in July 2009 claimed that phone hacking activities were known to a range of staff at the tabloid including its then editor [[Andy Coulson]]. At the time ''The Guardian'' made these claims, Coulson had left News International and was director of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] communications and planning. Due to this, some claimed that the reporting was politically motivated.<ref>{{cite news|last=Montgomerie |first=Tim|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/12/coulson-murdoch-sky-phone-hacking|title= This is about revenge, not phone taps| work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=12 July 2009 |accessdate=13 December 2009 }}</ref> The Conservative Party was quick to stand by Coulson.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8143893.stm |title= Cameron gives new backing to aide |publisher=BBC News |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

''The Guardian'' also reported that the ''News of the World'' had made payments in excess of <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million to three people subject to phone hacking, including [[Professional Footballers' Association]] chairman [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]], with the out-of-court settlements subject to secrecy clauses.<ref name=guardian091209>''The Guardian'', 9 December 2009, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/dec/09/phone-hacking-report-rebekah-wade MPs' phone-hacking report delayed as Rebekah Brooks called to give evidence]</ref> Around the same time, ''[[Private Eye]]'' revealed that ''The Guardian'' had, in order to avoid "all out war" with the ''News of the World'', chosen not to tell the same Culture, Media and Sport Committee that the <U+00A3>700,000 payment to Taylor was signed off in June 2008, by the directors of News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary owning the ''News of the World''&nbsp;- thus showing awareness of the matter at the highest levels.<ref>''[[Private Eye]]'' (1241)</ref> The reports led the [[Press Complaints Commission]] to reopen its inquiry into the matter (finding that it had not been "materially misled",<ref name="The Guardian 2009, PCC">''The Guardian'', 9 November 2009, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/09/pcc-phone-hacking-inquiry PCC finds no evidence that it was misled in phone hacking inquiry]</ref> leading ''The Guardian'''s editor [[Alan Rusbridger]] to resign from the PCC)<ref name=guardian091209/> and the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] to reopen its inquiry.<ref name=guardian091209/>

In January 2010, ''The Guardian'' revealed the out of court payment to Goodman on grounds of settling an unfair dismissal case, and the later subsequent payment to Mulcaire.<ref name=GuardPayJan10>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/08/news-international-clive-goodman|title=News International admits payout to phone-hacker was for unfair dismissal|author=James Robinson|work=The Guardian|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> This started a new series of both newspaper stories, and subsequent further written questions from the Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, to both News International and its executives.<ref name=GuardPayJan10/> In February 2010, ''The Guardian'' reported that three mobile phone companies had discovered that over a hundred of their customers had had their voicemails hacked. The companies identified the customers in 2007, after Scotland Yard disclosed numbers that had been accessed by Goodman and Mulcaire. A [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|freedom of information]] request by ''The Guardian'' found that the police had recovered 91 [[Personal identification number|PIN codes]] for accessing other people's voicemails in material seized from Mulcaire and Goodman.<ref name="davies"/> In April 2010, it was revealed from [[Crown Prosecution Service]] documents that although police had named only eight individuals in court, the Scotland Yard inquiry had actually uncovered over 4,000 names or partial names and nearly 3,000 full or partial telephone numbers from the materials seized from Mulcaire and Goodman.<ref name=guardian040410>Nick Davies.

In February 2010 ''The Guardian'' revealed that under Coulson the ''News of the World'' had rehired a private investigator shortly after his release from a seven-year prison sentence for blackmail. The ''News of the World'' had used the investigator prior to his imprisonment, at a time when Coulson was deputy editor.

In September 2010 ''The Guardian'' revealed that in 2009 plans by the Home Office to ask [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary]] to review the police investigation into the phone hacking scandal were cancelled "after intense internal lobbying", with a senior Home Office official warning that the Metropolitan Police would "deeply resent" an inquiry.<ref>Nick Davies, Nicholas Watt and Vikram Dodd, [[guardian.co.uk]], 6 September 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/06/phone-hacking-home-office-police Phone-hacking inquiry was abandoned to avoid upsetting police]</ref> Several days later the paper revealed comments by former ''News of the World'' journalist Paul McMullan on how widespread phone hacking had been under Andy Coulson; McMullan was one of six former ''News of the World'' journalists "who have independently told the Guardian that Coulson ... knew that his reporters were engaging in unlawful acts.".<ref>[[Nick Davies]], [[guardian.co.uk]], 8 September 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/08/phone-hacking-news-of-the-world-witness Phone hacking was rife at News of the World, claims new witness]</ref>

===The New York Times===
In September 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the results of an investigation it had begun in March which revealed further details about the extent of the ''News of the World'''s phone hacking, and about editor [[Andy Coulson]]'s alleged knowledge of it.<ref name="nytpiece">{{Cite news

==Police investigations==
===2009 review of original investigation===
In light of the new allegations in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in July 2009, the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson asked his assistant commissioner [[John Yates (police officer)|John Yates]] to review the original 2006 investigation for new evidence. In one 8-hour meeting, Yates reviewed the investigation and decided not to take any further action. In a public statement later, and in a July 2009, appearance at the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]], he said of the initial investigation that he "found it to be satisfactory."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/john-yatess-confession-prompts-calls-for-him-to-step-down-2311634.html|title=John Yates's confession prompts calls for him to step down|author=Matt Blake|work=The Independent|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> In a direct response to John Prescott, who had been particular outraged at the fact that police did not inform him of his phone being hacked, Yates specifically stated that there was no material evidence that Prescott's phone had been hacked.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8143656.stm |title=Prescott: Police decision 'so quick' |publisher=BBC News |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> Yates then passed his findings back to the Chief Constable, and in agreement with lawyers and the head of the Crown Prosecution Service [[Keir Starmer]], agreed that no further action need be taken, and the case not re-opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/09/john-yates-massive-regret-phone-hacking-investigation|title=John Yates expresses 'massive regret' over phone hacking investigation|author=Cherry Wilson|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> The Metropolitan Police hence declined to re-open their hacking inquiry in response to the claims in ''The Guardian'' stating that "no additional evidence has come to light" and it "therefore consider[ed] that no further investigation is required".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://cms.met.police.uk/met/news/major_operational_announcements/statement_from_ac_john_yates |title= Statement from AC John Yates|work=Metropolitan Police |publisher=met.police.uk |date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref>

{{cquote|We strongly condemn this behaviour which reinforces the widely held impression that the press generally regard themselves as unaccountable and that News International in particular has sought to conceal the truth about what really occurred.<ref>''The Guardian'', 24 February 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/24/phone-hacking-scandal-mps-report MPs' verdict on News of the World phone-hacking scandal: Amnesia, obfuscation and hush money]</ref>}}

Other News International newspapers, including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'', downplayed the report, devoting minimal coverage to it and emphasising the ''News of the World'''s response.<ref>''The Guardian'', 25 February 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/25/phone-hacking-sun-times The Sun and the Times keep quiet about phone hacking]</ref>

===New inquiries (September 2010)===
In the wake of the renewed allegations in September 2010, from ''The New York Times'', the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] in London opened a new inquiry into phone hacking.<ref name="newinquirysept10">{{Cite news | title = New inquiry into phone-hacking at News of the World | work=The Spy Report | publisher=Media Spy

==News International investigations==
===News Corporation internal re-investigation===
News International started an investigation of the evidence within the companies files, headed by group general manager [[William Lewis (journalist)|Will Lewis]]. Lewis quickly came across an email which referred to "the file" at the solicitors, and in December 2010, subsequently obtained all records held by Harbottle & Lewis regarding Clive Goodman's 2007 claim for unfair dismissal. Shocked at the content within the more than 200 emails, Lewis passed the file to another law firm, Hickman Rose.

In January 2011, this firm engaged [[Ken Macdonald|Ken Macdonald, Lord Macdonald QC]], the former head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], to provide a report to the board of News Corporation on the contents of the emails. Macdonald's report stated that he found evidence of indirect hacking, breaches of national security and serious crime; he closed on advising them to immediately call the police. After a board meeting in New York chaired by Rupert Murdoch in January 2011, when Macdonald's report and recommendations were accepted in full,<ref name=DMail2015461>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2015461/Why-did-Princes-lawyers-hide-hacking-evidence-Firm-advises-Royals-entangled-row-cover-up.html#ixzz1SLlwJKun|title=Why did Prince William's lawyers hide hacking evidence?

Subsequently the ''News of the World'' disclosed that it had suspended [[Ian Edmondson]], saying that it would take "appropriate action" if the litigation or the paper's own internal investigation found evidence of wrongdoing by any staff.<ref>{{Cite news | title = News of the World suspends executive after phone-hacking claims | work=The Spy Report | publisher=Media Spy | date = 6 January 2011 | url = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2011/01/06/uk-news-of-the-world-suspends-executive-after-phone-hacking-claims/ | accessdate =12 January 2011}}</ref> News International announced that they had sacked [[Ian Edmondson]] on 26 January 2011, the same day that the Metropolitan Police launched ''[[Operation Weeting]].''<ref>{{Cite news | title = News International's new hacking evidence | first = Robert | last = Peston | publisher= BBC News | date = 26 January 2011 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2011/01/news_internationals_new_hackin.html | accessdate =28 January 2011}}</ref>

==Hugh Grant==
In April 2011 actor [[Hugh Grant]] published an article in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' entitled "The Bugger, Bugged"<ref name=NewStatesman>{{cite news |title=The bugger, bugged |author=Hugh Grant |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=12 April 2011 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/newspapers/2011/04/phone-yeah-cameron-murdoch }}</ref> about a conversation following a chance encounter with Paul McMullan, former journalist and paparazzo for ''[[News of the World]]''. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n<U+00E9>e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest:

<blockquote>"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election... So that was my submission to parliament <U+2013> that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot."<ref name=NewStatesman /></blockquote>

When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police]] to "drag their feet" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed that this had happened, but also stated that the police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists, so had a motive to comply:

<blockquote>"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly."<ref name=NewStatesman /></blockquote>

Grant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of Grant himself "turning the tables" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=Guardian-2011-04-16>{{cite news |title=From Stephen Fry to Hugh Grant: The rise of the celebrity activist |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 April 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/apr/16/celebrity-activists-hugh-grant }}</ref>

Whilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared for example on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the then missing and subsequently murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence in her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation]], culminating in a bravura performance on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=guardian-2011-07-08>{{cite news |title=Hugh Grant's best role yet <U+2013> scourge of News International |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-07-08|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/08/hugh-grant-news-international-rupert-murdoch }}</ref>

==Further investigations==

Further investigations (beyond ''News of the World'' and/or beyond phone hacking) developed in 2011. Some of these also revealed further details of the phone hacking and of News International's handling of the phone hacking.
