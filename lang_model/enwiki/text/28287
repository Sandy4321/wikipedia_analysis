[[Image:1940Italian Libya.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Tripoli province was the most important of [[Italian Libya]]]]
'''Tripoli Province''' (''Provincia di Tripoli'' in Italian) was one of the [[provinces of Libya]] under Italian rule. It was established in 1937, with the official name: ''Commissariato Generale Provinciale di Tripoli''. It lasted until 1943.

==Characteristics==

The "Provincia di Tripoli" was located in northern [[Italian Libya]], next to [[Tunisia]]. Its administrative center was the city of [[Tripoli]] on the Mediterranean coast. 

The province experienced a huge economic growth in the late 1930s, with a great urban development of Tripoli while Italian colonists cultivated lands that had returned to native desert for many centuries, and improved [[Italian Libya]]'s agriculture to international standards (even with the creation of new farm villages)<ref>[http://www.architecturebeyond.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vittoria-capresi_I-centri-rurali-libici.pdf New villages in coastal Libya (in Italian)]</ref>. 

Most of the population was [[moslem]], but there was a growing community of [[Catholicism|catholics]] due to the [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian colonists]] immigration<ref>[http://www.orsomax.com/OEA/OEAvillaggi.htm Italian colonization]</ref>. In 1940 there were more than 70,000 catholics (of which 65,000 were Italians).

Additionally there were nearly 18,000 [[Jews]] in the Tripoli area<ref>[http://geoimages.berkeley.edu/libyajew/LibyanJews/thejews2west.html Statistics about Jews in northwestern Italian Libya]</ref>. Indeed after the Italian occupation of Libya in 1911, the Jews made great strides in education and economic conditions:at that time, there were about 21,000 Jews in the country, the majority in Tripoli. In the late 1930s, Fascist anti-Jewish laws were gradually enforced, and Jews were subject to repression: still, by 1941, the Jews accounted for a quarter of the population of Tripoli and maintained 44 synagogues <ref>[http://geoimages.berkeley.edu/libyajew/LibyanJews/thejews.html Jews in Tripoli]</ref>

The province from 1939 was considered officially part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], with the same laws. It was one of the 4 new Italian provinces of the so called ''Quarta Sponda'' ([[Fourth Shore]]) of Mussolini's [[Greater Italia]]. Indeed on January 9, 1939, the colony of Italian Libya was incorporated into "Metropolitan Italy" and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state (the French, in 1848, had incorporated [[French Algeria]] in the same manner).

In the coast of the province was built in 1937-1938 a section of the [[Via Balbia|Litoranea Balbia]], a road that went from [[Tripoli]] and Tunisia's frontier to the border of [[Egypt]]. 

The car tag for the Italian province of Tripoli was "TL". <ref>[http://www.targheitaliane.it/index_i.html?/italy/colonie/libia_i.html Italian car tags (in Italian)]</ref> In the province was even created the [[Tripoli Grand Prix]], an international motor racing event first held in 1925 on a racing circuit outside Tripoli (it lasted until 1940)<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtz-wzbs9Y Video of Tripoli Grand Prix]</ref>.

[[Image:Tripoli Stazione Centrale.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tripoli railway station in 1940]]
Tripoli had a railway station with some [[Italian Libya Railways|small railway connections to nearby cities]], when in August 1941 the Italians started to build a new 1040 km railway (with a 1435 mm. gauge, like the one used in Egypt and Tunisia) between Tripoli and [[Benghazi]]. But the war (with the defeat of the Italian Army) stopped the construction the next year. The project was stopped in the fall of 1942, leaving many infrastructures like stations and connection roads already done in the "Provincia di Tripoli". 

The province of Tripoli was divided in 6 sections ("Circondari" in Italian):

*[[Tripoli]]
*[[Zawiya, Libya|Zuavia]]
*[[Sugh el Giumaa]]
*[[Zuwara]]
*[[Nalut]]
*[[Garian]]

==Population==

The indigenous population was [[arab]], with some [[berbers]] in the [[Nafusa Mountains]] south of Tripoli and some thousands [[Jews]] and a few [[Maltese]] <ref>[http://www.maltamigration.com/history/la_nostra_storia.pdf History of the Maltese in Libya]</ref> on the coast. The [[Italians]] colonized the coastal cities and were mainly in the capital Tripoli, where they were nearly half the inhabitants in 1940.

In the province of Tripoli thousands of Italians (called "ventimilli") moved to live in 1938 and 1939 and founded some agricultural villages (Bianchi<ref>[http://www.airl.it/photogallery/varie/varie_04.php Foto of Bianchi village]</ref>, Giordani, Oliveti<ref>[http://www.airl.it/photogallery/varie/varie_06.php Foto of Oliveti village]</ref>, Marconi, etc..).<ref>[http://www.orsomax.com/OEA/OEA_ventimila.html Italian colonization of northern Libya (in Italian)]</ref>
