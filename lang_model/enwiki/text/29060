Brand attended Grays School, a [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]]. He made his theatrical debut at the age of 15 playing ''"Fat Sam"'' in a [[school]] production of ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', which prompted him to become an actor.  He began working as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]], and applied to study at the [[Italia Conti Academy]]. He was accepted, and Essex council funded his tuition for an introductory year, with potential funding for three additional years. Brand joined the Academy in 1991.

In 1995, Brand applied for the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] and [[Drama Centre London]] and was accepted to Drama Centre. By this point he was a [[heroin]] addict and an [[alcoholic]]. He was expelled in the final term of his last year for smashing a glass over his head and then stabbing himself in the chest and arms because of poor reactions to one of his performances. After leaving Drama Centre, Brand decided to focus on comedy, and began writing material with [[Karl Theobald]], whom he met at Drama Centre. They formed a short-lived double act, ''Theobald and Brand on Ice''.

==Career==
===Stand-up===
Brand's first significant [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] appearance was at the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] final in 2000. Although he finished fourth, his performance attracted the attention of an agent, Nigel Klarfeld of Gagged and Bound Comedy Ltd.<ref>[http://www.agents-uk.com/agents/short_info/682 Bound & Gagged Comedy Ltd]</ref> That year, he also made his [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh]] debut as one-third of the stand-up show ''Pablo Diablo's Cryptic Triptych'', alongside [[ventriloquist]] Mark Felgate and Anglo-Iranian comic [[Shappi Khorsandi]].

In 2004, he took his first one-man show, the confessional ''Better Now'' to the Edinburgh Festival, giving an honest account of his heroin addiction. He returned the following year with ''Eroticised Humour''. He launched his first nationwide tour, ''Shame'', in 2006. Brand drew on embarrassing incidents in his own life and the [[tabloid]] press's treatment of him since he became famous. The show was released on DVD as ''Russell Brand: Live''. 

Brand appeared in a sketch and performed stand-up at the 2006 ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|Secret Policeman's Ball]]''. In March 2007, he co-hosted an evening of the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] gigs with [[Noel Fielding]]. In December 2007, Brand performed for [[HM Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[HRH Prince Philip]] as an act in the [[Royal Variety Performance|2007 Royal Variety Performance]]. 

His second nationwide tour, in 2007, was called ''Russell Brand: Only Joking'' and released on DVD as ''Russell Brand: Doin' Life''.

While in the U.S., Brand began performing stand-up and recorded a special for [[Comedy Central]] titled ''Russell Brand in New York'', which aired in March 2009.<ref>[http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=4&article=47727 Brand in first US comedy special]</ref> Brand began touring the UK, America and Australia from January to April 2009 on a tour called ''Russell Brand: Scandalous''.<ref>[http://www.allgigs.co.uk/search/tourdates/52509/Russell_Brand-1.html Russell Brand 2009 Tour Dates]</ref> In October a further four dates that where performed in November where added to raise money for Focus 12 the drug charity that Brand is a patron of.<ref>[http://www.russellbrand.tv/2009/10/last-chance-to-see-the-scandalous-tour/ Last Chance to see the Scandalous Tour]</ref> ''Russell Brand: Scandalous'' was released on DVD on November 9, 2009.

===Presenting===
Brand's first presenting role came in 2000 as a [[video journalist|VJ]] on the [[music channel]] [[MTV One|MTV]]. He presented ''Dance Floor Chart'', touring nightclubs in Britain and [[Ibiza]], and hosted the [[teatime]] request show ''Select''. However,  Brand was fired after coming to work dressed as [[Osama bin Laden]] the day after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and bringing his [[drug dealer]] to the MTV studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/nov/13/biography.drugsandalcohol|title=And then I became a junkie ... <nowiki>|</nowiki> By genre <nowiki>|</nowiki> Guardian Unlimited Books|accessdate=2007-11-18|last=Brand|first=Russell|date=2007-11-13|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref>

After leaving MTV, Brand starred in ''[[RE:Brand]]'', a British documentary and [[comedy television]] programme that aimed to take a challenging look at cultural [[taboo]]s. It was conceived, written, and hosted by Brand, with the help of his comic partner for many projects, [[Matt Morgan (comedian)|Matt Morgan]]. The series was shown on the now-defunct digital satellite channel [[UK Play]] in 2002. 

In 2004, he hosted ''[[List of Big Brother (UK) shows#Big Brother's Big Mouth|Big Brother's Eforum]]'' on [[E4 (TV)|E4]], a sister show to ''[[Big Brother (UK series 5)|Big Brother 5]]''. The show gave celebrity guests and the public the chance to have their say on the goings-on inside the ''Big Brother'' house. For ''[[Big Brother (UK series 6)|Big Brother 6]]'', the show's name changed to ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]''. Following ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]'', Brand said he would not return to host the ''[[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]'' series of ''Big Brother's Big Mouth''. In a statement, Brand thanked all the producers for "taking the risk of employing an ex-[[junkie]] twerp" to front the show. Of his time presenting the show, he said, "The three years I've spent on ''Big Brother's Big Mouth'' have been an unprecedented joy".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6526833.stm Brand quits Big Brother spin-off] at [[BBC News]]</ref> 

Brand hosted a one-off special called ''Big Brother According to Russell Brand'', in which Brand took a surreal, sideways look at ''Big Brother'' through the ages. On 8 January, 2008, Brand was the fifth celebrity to "hijack" the Big Brother house,<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrothercelebrityhijack/a83754/russell-brand-speaks-to-the-house.html Russell Brand speaks to the house]</ref> in the [[E4 (channel)|E4]] show ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''. Brand next returned to MTV in the spring of 2006 as presenter of the chat show ''[[1 Leicester Square]]'', which initially aired at 8 p.m. on Sundays before being shifted to a post-watershed time of 10 p.m. on Mondays, allowing for a more adult-oriented theme. Guests have included [[Tom Cruise]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[The Mighty Boosh]], and [[Boy George]]. A second series began in September 2006 on [[MTV UK]]. After ''Big Brother 7'' finished, Brand presented a [[debate]] show called ''[[Russell Brand's Got Issues]]'', on digital channel [[E4 (TV)|E4]]. The viewing figures for the first episode were seen as disappointing, being beaten by nearly all of E4's main multi-channel rivals despite a big publicity and [[promotional campaign]] for the show.

The poor ratings prompted the network to repackage the show as ''[[The Russell Brand Show (television show)|The Russell Brand Show]]'' and move it to [[Channel 4]].<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a39197/primetime-slots-for-comedians-hill-and-brand.html Primetime slots for comedians Hill and Brand]</ref> The first episode was broadcast on 24 November on [[Channel 4]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6133116.stm Brand and Ross to go head-to-head] at [[BBC News]]</ref> and it ran for five weeks.  

Brand presented the 2006 [[NME Awards]]. At the awards in a response to his act, [[Bob Geldof]] called him a "[[cunt]]", to which Brand replied, "Really it's no surprise [Geldof]'s such an expert on famine. He has after all been dining out on '[[I Don't Like Mondays]]' for 30 years".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jun/18/broadcasting.arts Interview with Russell Brand | Media | The Observer]</ref>  Brand hosted the [[2007 BRIT Awards]] and presented [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] with an "Outstanding Contribution to Music" award at the event.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6205786.stm Russell Brand to host Brit Awards] at [[BBC News]]</ref> He also hosted one hour of [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. On 7 July, 2007, he presented at the [[Live Earth concert, London|UK leg]] of [[Live Earth]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], London.

On 12 December, 2007, [[BBC Four]] aired ''Russell Brand On the Road'', a [[documentary]] presented by Brand and Matt Morgan about the writer [[Jack Kerouac]] and his novel ''[[On the Road]]''. So Brand returned to Channel 4 to host ''[[Russell Brand's Ponderland]]'', in which he discussed topics like childhood and science through stand-up comedy. The show first aired on 22 October, 2007, and it continued for the next five nights. A second series began on 30 October, 2008, drawing more than a million viewers, and was broadcast every Thursday night for four weeks, plus a Christmas special that aired in December. 

Brand was later announced as the host of the 2008 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], which drew skepticism from the American media, as he was relatively unknown to the American public. Brand's stint as host of the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]] was not without controversy.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/russell-brand/38433 Russell Brand to host MTV Awards]</ref> At one point, he said the night "marked the launch of a very new [[Britney Spears]] era", referring to it as "the resurrection of [Spears]".
