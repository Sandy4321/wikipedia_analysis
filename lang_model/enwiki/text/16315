'''Voice-over translation''' is an audiovisual [[translation]] technique in which [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] is recorded over the original audio track which can be heard in the background.

This method of translation is most often used in [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[news report]]s to translate words of foreign-language interviewees. In some countries, most notably in [[Eastern Europe]], it is commonly used to translate all kinds of [[film|movies]].

==Voice-over translation of movies==

A typical voice-over translation is usually done by a single male [[Voice acting|voice artist]]. It is fast paced, though fully intelligible, usually trailing the original dialogue by a few seconds. The original audio can thus be heard to a large extent, allowing the viewer to grasp the emotions in the actors' voices, as well as hear the actors' musical performances if the film contains singing. The dubbing usually contains only a hint of emotion, as many of the interpreters have stated that they try to follow the narrow path between sounding monotonous and "[[overacting]]"<ref name="MikhalevMozart"/>. A significant drawback of such dubbing is the ambiguity as to which character is speaking at a given time, as the interpreter usually makes very few changes in intonation to distinguish between different participants in a dialogue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Any text appearing on the screen is also read out by the interpreter.

Due to the imprecise nature of simultaneous interpretation, as well as the difficulties faced by non-native speakers in understanding foreign-language [[vernacular]], idioms, and culture references, voice-over translations are often riddled with errors in translation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Dmitriy Puchkov]] has been very outspoken about the issue, stating that simultaneous interpretation should be abandoned in favour of a more precise translation, with thorough efforts to research and find Russian equivalents in cases of [[lexical gap]]s, and maintains numerous lists of gaffes made by interpreters, including highly experienced ones such as Mikhalev<ref name="GoblinFAQ">{{Ru icon}} [http://oper.ru/torture/read.php?t=1045689061 Interview with Dmitriy Puchkov], Tynu40k Goblina.</ref>. However, others have commented that the creativity of good interpreters can make the film more enjoyable, though deviating from the filmmaker's original intentions<ref name="MikhalevMozart"/>.

===In Russia===

Called '''Gavrilov translation''' ({{lang-ru|<U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434> <U+0413><U+0430><U+0432><U+0440><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>}} ''perevod Gavrilova'' {{IPA-ru|p<U+02B2><U+026A><U+027E><U+02B2><U+026A><U+02C8>v<U+0252>d<U+032A> <U+0261><U+0250><U+02C8>v<U+027E>i<U+02D0>l<U+0250>v<U+0250>|}}) or '''single-voice translation''' ({{lang-ru|<U+043E><U+0434><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434>}}), the technique takes its name from [[Andrei Gavrilov (voice artist)|Andrey Gavrilov]], one of the most prominent artists in the area, but the name used to refer to single-voice dubs in general, not necessarily those performed by Gavrilov himself. Such dubbing is ubiquitous in Russian-speaking countries on films shown on [[cable television]] and sold on [[VHS|video]], especially [[Copyright infringement|pirate copies]], and are sometimes included as additional [[audio track]]s on [[DVD]]s sold in the region, along with dubbing performed by multiple [[actor]]s.

During the early years of the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era, when availability of foreign films was severely restricted, [[Goskino]], the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] State Committee for Cinematography, held closed-door screenings of many Western films, open mainly to workers in the [[film industry]], politicians, and other members of the [[elite]]<ref name="VolodarskiyMaxim">{{Ru icon}} [http://nadoelo.ru/txt/volodar1.php Interview with Leonid Volodarskiy], "[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]" magazine.</ref>. Those screenings were [[Interpreting#Simultaneous|interpreted simultaneously]] by interpreters who specialised in films, where an effective conveyance of humour, idioms, and other subtleties of speech were required. Some of the most prolific "Gavrilov translators" began their careers at such screenings, including Andrey Gavrilov himself, as well as [[Aleksey Mikhaylovich Mikhalyov|Aleksey Mikhalyov]] and [[Leonid Volodarskiy]]. Their services were also used at [[film festival]]s, where Western films were accessible to a larger public, and allowed the interpreters to gain further recognition.

With the introduction of [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s in the 1970s, and the subsequent boom in illegal pirate videocassette sales, which were the only means of seeing Western films available to the general public, the same interpreters began to lend their voices to these tapes. Many of their voices had a distinct [[nasal voice|nasal]] quality, most pronounced in Volodarskiy, which led to the rise of an [[urban legend]] that the interpreters wore a [[noseclip]] so that the authorities would not be able to identify them by their voice and arrest them. Interviews with many of the interpreters revealed that this was not true<ref name="VolodarskiyMaxim"/><ref name="IvanovVideo">{{Ru icon}} [http://nadoelo.ru/zip/golosa/ivanov.avi Interview with Mikhail Ivanov], "Chas Pik" [[Television program|TV programme]]. ([[Audio Video Interleave|AVI video]])</ref>, and that authorities generally turned a blind eye to them, focusing their efforts on the distributors of the tapes instead. This was also due to the lack of specific law forbidding the work of these interpreters, and they could only be prosecuted under the relatively minor offence of [[illicit work]]<ref name="VolodarskiyKomPravda">{{Ru icon}} [http://nadoelo.ru/txt/volodar2.php Interview with Leonid Volodarskiy], A. Vasilyev, "[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]".</ref>.

The three aforementioned interpreters, Gavrilov, Mikhalev, and Volodarskiy, were the leading names in film dubbing in the last decades of the 20th century, with dubs done by each of them numbering in the thousands<ref name="VolodarskiyMaxim"/><ref name="IvanovVideo"/>. Many of these dubs were made using simultaneous interpretation, due to time constraints caused by competition among the distributors to be the first to release a new production, as well as the sheer volume of new films<ref name="IvanovVideo"/>. Whenever possible, however, the interpreters preferred to watch the films a few times first, making notes on the more difficult parts of the dialogue, and only then record a dub, which also allowed them to refuse dubbing movies they didn't like<ref name="MikhalevMozart">{{Ru icon}} [http://www.trworkshop.net/faces/mikhalev.htm Alexey Mikhalev: The Mozart of Simultaneous Interpretation], S. Kudryavtsev.</ref>. While each of the interpreters dubbed a wide range of films, with many films being available in multiple versions done by different interpreters, the big names usually had specific [[film genre]]s that they were known to excel at. Gavrilov, for instance, was usually heard in [[action film]]s, including ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]] ''and ''[[Die Hard]]''; Mikhalev specialised in [[Comedy film|comedy]] and [[Drama film|drama]], most notably ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''; while Volodarskiy, who is most readily associated not with a particular genre, but with the nasal intonation of his voice, is best remembered for his dubbing of ''[[Star Wars]]''<ref name="Voices">{{Ru icon}} [http://kinofond.narod.ru/Perevod.html Voices Behind the Scenes], A. Loyevskiy, "Video-Ace Express" magazine, iss. 15-16.</ref>. It is unclear why the term "Gavrilov translation" came to bear Gavrilov's name, despite Mikhalev being the most celebrated of the interpreters<ref name="Voices"/>, though the popular nature of films dubbed by Gavrilov may be the most likely explanation. Other notable names of the period include [[Vasiliy Gorchakov]], [[Mikhail Ivanov (voice artist)|Mikhail Ivanov]], [[Grigoriy Libergal]], and [[Yuriy Zhivov]].

After [[perestroika]] and the collapse of the Soviet Union, when restrictions on Westerns films were lifted, [[movie theater|movie theatres]], the state television channels, and eventually DVD releases primarily employed multiple-voice dubbings done by professional actors. However, cable television and the thriving pirate video industry continued fuelling demand for Gavrilov translations. This period marked a significant drop in the quality of such dubbings, as the intense competition between the numerous pirate groups and the lack of available funds resulted in releases with non-professional in-house dubbing<ref name="VolodarskiyMaxim"/>. This was further exacerbated by the death of Mikhalev in 1994 and fewer recordings being produced by many of the other skilled veterans of the industry, who pursued alternate career paths. Numerous well-regarded newcomers took their place, including [[Aleksei Medvedev (translator)|Alexey Medvedev]], [[Petr Glants]], [[Petr Kartsev]], [[Pavel Sanayev]], [[Sergey Vizgunov]], and most famously [[Dmitry Puchkov|Dmitry "Goblin" Puchkov]]. The latter is notorious for his direct translation of [[profanity]], as well as alternative "funny translations" of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].

Recently, the use of Russian [[Mat (language)|mat]] (profanity) in the dubbings has been a great source of controversy. While many pirate recordings do not shy away from translating expletives literally, Gavrilov, Mikhalev, and Volodarskiy have all stated that they feel that Russian mat is more emotionally charged and less publicly acceptable than [[English language|English]] obscenities, and would only use it in their dubs when they felt it was absolutely crucial to the film's plot<ref name="MikhalevMozart"/><ref name="VolodarskiyKomPravda"/><ref name="GavrilovVideo">{{Ru icon}} [http://nadoelo.ru/zip/golosa/gavrilov.avi Interview with Andrey Gavrilov] "Rossiya" [[television network]].

===In Poland===

Voice-over is the traditional translation method in [[Poland|Polish]] television and DVDs (which most of the time provide the original audio track), except for children's material, especially animation, which is often fully dubbed. The word ''[[lektor]]'' ("reader") is used to refer to the voice artist.

Voice-over is the preferred form of dubbing among Polish viewers, and attempts to introduce full dubs to Polish television met with viewer protests and ultimately failed.<ref>{{Pl icon}}http://www.emetro.pl/emetro/1,50145,2513330.html</ref>{{dead link|date=November 2010}} It is also preferred over subtitles; an opinion poll conducted in 2008 shown only 19% of Poles supports the switch to subtitling in television.<ref>{{Pl icon}} [http://www.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/pierwsze-angielski/article218179/TVP_odpowiada_Beda_napisy_zamiast_lektora.html TVP answers: there will be subtitles instead of voice-over], [[Dziennik]]</ref> {{dead link|date=November 2010}}

The most notable readers are [[Janusz Szyd<U+0142>owski]], [[Maciej Gudowski]], [[Tomasz Knapik]], [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Olejniczak]] and [[Piotr Borowiec]].

===In Bulgaria===

In [[Bulgaria]], voice-over translation is also common, but each film (or episode) is normally voiced by at least four actors. The voice artists try to match the original voice and preserve the intonation. The main reason for the use of this type of translation is that unlike synchronized voice translation, it takes a relatively short time to produce as there is no need to synchronize the voices with the character's lip movements, which is compensated by the quieted original audio. When there is no speaking in the film for some time, the original sound is turned up. Recently, as more films are distributed with separate voice and noises-and-music tracks, some voice-over translations in Bulgaria are produced by only turning down the voice track, in this way not affecting the other sounds. One actor always reads the translation crew's names over the show's ending credits (except for when there are dialogs over the credits).
