==Geography==
Cavillon is a small village surrounded by fields and woods, situated on the D121, D156 and D95 crossroads,
some 15 miles northwest of [[Amiens]]. Predominantly a farming area raising dairy cows, pigs and free-range chickens. A project to create a large pig-rearing facility is currently undergoing discussion and planning approval, much to the disgruntlement of the local population.

==History==
Cavillon has existed since [[Gallo-Roman]] times. During [[ploughing]], archaeologists regularly find artifacts in the ground between the town and the place known as "''The Brickyard''", where a [[Roman]] villa once stood.  
Found under the written form "''Cavellon''" as early as 1166, this town was mentioned again as "''Caveillon''" in 1301 and appeared under its current name of "''Cavillon''" in 1567.  

==Places of note==
* The church of St. Nicolas, is in stone with a low [[steeple]] covered with slates. On the [[apse]], one can read the date of 1781, but the [[nave]] is from the end of the 16th century. 
* The ch<U+00E2>teau, near the church, in a beautiful [[woodland]] park, was built of bricks and stone in 1648. Two lower wings were added in 1698 and 1830. In the 1950s, it was the property of the [[Abbaye du Gard]] (on the left bank of the [[river Somme]], downstream of [[Picquigny]]).  
* The old school and mayor<U+2019>s office was built in 1868. The school closed in 1960. In 1996, the building was restored and laid out as a meeting room and commune secretary<U+2019>s office.  
* On the other side of the D95, that crosses the town, is the '' 'old cemetery''', surrounded by a brick wall, where rest the remains of five soldiers of the [[British Commonwealth]].  
* Chapelle Notre-Dame des Victoires, on the road leading to [[Oissy]].

==Leisure, cultural and tourist activities==

* The town centre has a newly laid out square with flowering plants, benches and a [[petanque]] [[piste]].  The biggest of Cavillon<U+2019>s three ponds is shaded by trees and the nests of [[moorhen]]s and [[duck]]s can be seen on its flowery banks.
* The attractiveness of the town of Cavillon, well maintained despite the municipal worker having to divide his time with neighbouring towns, is also attributed to the residents, encouraged by the wife of the current mayor, to grow flowers in their own gardens.
* Several walking routes pass through the commune of Cavillon, with directional panels provided by the C.C.O.A.
