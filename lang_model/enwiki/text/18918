This '''list of works by Joseph Priestley'''  classifies all of the works by [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733 <U+2013> 1804), a [[Kingdom of Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English Dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], [[theologian]], and educator. He is best known for his discovery, simultaneously with [[Antoine Lavoisier]], of [[oxygen]] [[gas]].

A member of marginalized religious groups throughout his life and a proponent of what was called "rational Dissent," Priestley advocated [[religious toleration]] and equal rights for [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]]s. He argued for extensive civil rights in works such as the important ''[[An Essay on the First Principles of Government|Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'', believing that individuals could bring about progress and eventually the [[Millennialism|Millennium]]; he was the foremost British expounder of [[providentialism]].<ref>Tapper, Alan. "Joseph Priestley." ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' 252: ''British Philosophers 1500<U+2013>1799''. Eds. Philip B. Dematteis and Peter S. Fosl. Detroit: Gale Group (2002), 314.</ref> Priestley also made significant contributions to education, publishing, among other things, ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar; adapted to the Use of Schools|The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'', a seminal work on [[grammar|English grammar]]. In his most lasting contributions to education, he argued for the benefits of a [[liberal arts]] education and of the value of the study of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]]. In his metaphysical works, Priestley "attempt[ed] to combine theism, materialism, and determinism," a project that has been called "audacious and original."<ref>Tapper, 314.</ref> 

Throughout his life, Priestley was known not only as a political and theological controversialist but also as a natural philosopher.  His scientific reputation rested on his invention of [[soda water]], his writings on [[electricity]] and his discovery of several "airs" ([[gas]]es), the most famous being what Priestley named "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen).  But Priestley's determination to reject Lavoisier's "new chemistry" and to cling to [[phlogiston theory]] left him isolated within the scientific community.

This list of [[Joseph Priestley|Joseph Priestley's]] works is taken from Ronald E. Crook's ''A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804'' (unless otherwise noted) and it follows very closely his generic subdivisions. All texts are by Priestley unless otherwise noted and only the first English  language editions of the texts are listed below.<ref>Crook, Ronald E. ''A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804''. London: Library Association, 1966.</ref>  The dash at the beginning of each entry below is a shorthand for the author's name, Joseph Priestley, consistent with standard bibliographic custom.
