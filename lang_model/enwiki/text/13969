'''Tropical Storm Henri''' was a [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm]] that formed in the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The eighth storm of the season, Henri was one of six tropical cyclones to hit the [[United States]] in the year. Henri formed from a tropical wave in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in early September, and crossed over [[Florida]] as a tropical depression. Its remnants later moved into the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] before dissipating completely.

Henri caused little damage as a tropical cyclone. In Florida, it dropped heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]], though damage was limited to minor [[flood]]ing damage. In [[Delaware]] and [[Pennsylvania]], damage was greater, where heavy rainfall damaged hundreds of houses and businesses. The resulting floods in Delaware were described as a [[100-year flood|1 in 500 year event]]. The total damage by Henri along its path amounted to $19.6&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;[[USD]], $21.5&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), but no deaths were reported.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Henri 2003 track.png}}
On [[August 22]], a [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]], and it moved westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] without developing significantly until it entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on [[September 1]]. At that time, [[convection]] steadily organized around the wave's low-level center of circulation as it moved northward, and the wave developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on [[September 3]] while located about 300&nbsp;[[mile]]s (480&nbsp;[[kilometer]]s) west of [[Tampa, Florida]]. Embedded within a slow [[latitude|mid-latitude]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]], the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on [[September 5]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Daniel P.

[[Image:Henri Remnants (2003).JPG|right|thumb|Remnants of Henri making landfall on [[North Carolina]]]]
Despite strong southwesterly vertical [[wind shear|shear]], Henri continued intensifying while moving eastward, and reached a peak strength of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) later on [[September 5]]. Shortly thereafter, though, the shear greatly weakened the storm, and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Henri was not able to recover its intensity, and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Clearwater, Florida]] on [[September 6]] as a 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) tropical depression, and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast.<ref name="tcr"/> Despite initial predictions of reintensification over open waters due to potentially lower shear,<ref name="hendisc13">{{cite web|author=James L.

==Preparations==
The [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Tropical Storm Warning]] from [[Englewood, Florida|Englewood]] to [[Indian Pass, Florida]] while Henri was a tropical depression; however, warnings were discontinued by the time Henri made landfall.<ref name="tcr"/> Flood warnings were issued across the state prior to the storm making landfall, with predictions of 5 to 10&nbsp;inches (125&ndash;255&nbsp;mm) of rainfall.<ref name="fla">{{cite web|author=GoFlorida|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Henri|accessdate = 2006-06-12|url=http://goflorida.about.com/b/a/023922.htm}}</ref> As a result of the storm's approach, twelve shelters were placed on standby.

==Impact==
[[Image:Henri2003rain.gif|right|thumb|250px|Rainfall totals from Henri]]
Henri dropped heavy rainfall along its path, with the worst of the [[flood]]ing occurring in [[Delaware]]. The storm caused $19.6 million in damage (2003 [[USD]]), primarily in Delaware. 

===Florida, Bahamas, and Bermuda===
Prior to making landfall, the storm produced strong waves on the Florida west coast.<ref name="fla"/> Following a summer of tropical moisture in [[Florida]], Henri brought more heavy rainfall to the [[Aquifer#Saturated versus unsaturated|saturated]] state,<ref name="flsummer">{{cite web|author=State of Florida Department of Community Affairs|year=2003|title=2003 Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate = 2006-06-12|url=http://www.floridadisaster.org/publicAnnounce/03HurricaneWrap.pdf}}</ref> peaking at 9.09&nbsp;in (230&nbsp;mm) in [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]] in the southeast portion of the state.

In the [[Bahamas]], outer [[rainband]]s from Henri dropped around 1&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm) of rain.

===Mid-Atlantic===
In [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[Maryland]], rainfall was generally light, with the exception of a few areas receiving over 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm).<ref name="hpc"/> Henri produced greater amounts of rain in [[Delaware]] and [[Pennsylvania]], with a peak of 9.02&nbsp;in (229&nbsp;mm) in [[Hockessin, Delaware|Hockessin]].<ref name="dedam">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Delaware|accessdate = 2006-06-12|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~494478}}</ref> In [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania]], over eight&nbsp;inches of rain fell in around six&nbsp;hours, while Doppler Radar estimated that [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]] received over 10&nbsp;inches (255&nbsp;mm) in a five&nbsp;hour period. The heavy rainfall lead to record discharge rates along the [[Red Clay Creek]], which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26&nbsp;feet (8&nbsp;m).

In [[Delaware]], the flooding damaged numerous houses, including 194 in the [[Glenville, Delaware|Glenville]] area. The rapid flooding trapped numerous people in their cars and homes, forcing at least one rescue by helicopter. Those people were evacuated to nearby schools.

Flash flooding in Pennsylvania resulted in 2,600&nbsp;emergency 911 calls and around 100&nbsp;rescues for cars or houses. The flooding destroyed 12&nbsp;homes, and damaged 336, over half of them severely. Wet soil downed trees and power lines, causing power outages to 109,000&nbsp;[[PECO Energy]] customers. High floodwaters damaged 22&nbsp;bridges and closed 2&nbsp;indefinitely,<ref name="padam"/> while the flooding closed several roads, including a portion of [[U.S. Route 1|U.S. Highway 1]] in [[Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania|Chadds Ford]].<ref name="padam2">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Pennsylvania|accessdate = 2006-06-12|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~519029}}</ref> Damage in Pennsylvania totaled to $3.5&nbsp;million (2003 [[USD]], $3.8&nbsp;million 2006 USD).<ref name="padam"/> The impacts were severely compounded the following week by [[Hurricane Isabel]] across the region.

==Aftermath==
On [[September 23]], just days after the storm moved through, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] declared [[New Castle County, Delaware]] as a disaster area following the effects of Henri and later [[Hurricane Isabel]]. The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities.<ref name="defema">{{cite web|author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]|year=2003|title=Federal Disaster Funds Authorized To Aid Delaware Recovery From Tropical Storm Henri|accessdate = 2006-06-13|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=5161}}</ref> By two months after the storm, 659&nbsp;residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or [[FEMA]], totaling to just over $1&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $1.1&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD). 141&nbsp;small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $2.75&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).

Because the damage was localized and overall minimal, the name '''Henri''' was not retired, and it is scheduled to be used next the 2009 season.
