'''Markus K. Brunnermeier''' is a [[Financial economics|financial economist]] specializing in [[Financial crisis|financial crises]] and panics. His work focuses on the role financial frictions (e.g. [[transaction cost]]s) play in the formation and collapse of [[economic bubble]]s.  Brunnermeier is an associate editor of [[The American Economic Review]] as well as the [[Journal of Finance]] and a visiting scholar at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]].  Prior to completing his PhD in economics at the [[London School of Economics]] he attended various universities in Germany and the United States.  Upon graduating in 1998, Brunnermeier accepted an [[Professor#United_States_and_Canada|assistant professorship]] at [[Princeton University]].  He currently serves at Edwards S. Sanford Professor of Economics at Princeton University's [[Bendheim Center for Finance]], a position he has held since 2008.  He is the eighth winner of the [[Germ<U+00E1>n Bern<U+00E1>cer Prize]], awarded to European economists under 40 who contribute significantly to the fields of [[finance]] and [[macroeconomics]].

==Education and academic career==

Growing up in [[Landshut]], Germany, Brunnermeier expected to follow his father into the business of carpentry.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Young Guns: Five Hot Minds in Economics: Markus Brunnermeier|journal=Yale Economic Review|publisher=[[Yale University]]|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~markus/CV/5_hot_economists.htm}}</ref>  A slump in the housing market pressured Brunnermeier into the [[Taxation in Germany|tax office]], the [[German Army|Army]] and eventually the [[University of Regensburg]] where he received his undergraduate degree in 1993.<ref name="Bubble lab">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121089412378097011.html|title=Bernanke's Bubble Laboratory|last=Lahart|first=Justin|date=May 16, 2008|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>  He continued his studies in the masters program in economics at [[Vanderbilt University]] before returning to the [[Bonn Graduate School of Economics]] under the European Doctoral Program.

While at the London School of Economics, Brunnermeier parlayed a survey paper into a book on asset prices and crashes.<ref name="Bubble lab" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|title=Asset Pricing under Asymmetric Information: Bubbles, Crashes, Technical Analysis and Herding|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|date=2001|isbn=9780198296980}}</ref>  He was subsequently hired by Princeton University as an assistant professor in 1998.

==Work on financial crises==

Conventional wisdom in financial economics commonly takes the form of the [[Efficient market hypothesis]] (EMH), a proposition which argues that markets incorporate all information relevant to prices immediately and consequently the price of a given asset accurately represents the likely value of that asset.<ref group=note>There are multiple forms of the EMH, each with various levels of confidence among academics economists.  Among the strong, semi-strong, and weak versions of the hypothesis, the latter have higher levels of support.  See Beechey, Gruen & Vickery (2000) for more detail.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beechey|first=Meredith|coauthors=Gruen, David; Vickery, James|date=January 2000|title=The Efficient Market Hypothesis: A Survey|journal=Research Discussion Papers|publisher=Reserve Bank of Australia|volume=2000-01|issue=|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/rdp/RDP2000-01.pdf}}</ref>  Faced with the empirical evidence that asset prices diverged from their [[Fundamental analysis|fundamentals]] during the [[dot-com bubble]], Brunnermeier crafted a model of trading where participants in the market would recognize bubbles in asset prices but continue to trade "into the wind".<ref>{{cite video| people ='''Brunnermeier, Markus'''; Hong, Harrison; [[Charlie Rose|Rose, Charlie]] (Host); Xiong, Wie| title =Charlie Rose | medium = Television| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| location = | year2 = 2008|url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2008/08/14/2/a-discussion-about-the-federal-reserve}}</ref>  Traders would hold a belief (either justified or unjustified) that they could unwind their positions gracefully before the bubble burst, leading them to push up asset values rather than realize their gains immediately.  Brunnermeier's paper, coauthored with Stefan Nagel on this phenomenon won the [[Smith Breeden Prize]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afajof.org/journal/prizeabs.asp#first04oct|title=Brattle and Smith Breeden Prizewinners|publisher=The American Finance Association|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|coauthors=Nagel, Stephan|date=2004|title=Hedge Funds and the Technology Bubble|journal=[[Journal of Finance]]|publisher=The American Finance Association|volume=59|issue=5|pages=2013-2040|doi=0.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00690.x}}</ref>  

However, in unwinding those positions, some traders may fear that their movements in the market may expose their intent and allow competitors to prey on their trades, [[Short (finance)|short selling]] an asset they know a competitor must sell.  Likewise, a trader who finds themselves in financial distress (e.g. [[Long Term Capital Management]]) due to unforeseen losses might face the same predation.  Brunnermeier and Lasse Pederson analyzed this particular form of [[Liquidity risk|liquidity risk]] and constructed a model which produced systemic risks from a small number of traders being forced to liquidate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|coauthors=Pedersen, Jasse Heje|date=2005|title=Predatory Trading|journal=[[Journal of Finance]]|publisher=The American Finance Association|volume=60|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00781.x}}</ref>  This paper won the [[Michael Brennan Award|Barklays Global Investors Prize]] for its original presentation at the European Finance Association in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efa-online.org/r/default.asp?iId=IMGLI|title=Best Paper Awards|publisher=European Financial Association|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>

Work in general asset price bubbles caused Brunnermeier to examine the housing market to see if the same behaviors existed in the home price bubble and subsequent [[Global financial crisis of 2008<U+2013>2009|liquidity crisis in 2008]].  He determined that the same vicious cycles were at work.  Home prices fall forcing [[Margin_(finance)#Margin_call|margin calls]] on complex [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], which forces traders to close out more positions, further depressing prices.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/business/economy/18norris.html|title=High and Low Finance: Got a Fix? Please, Call the Fed |last=Norris|first=Floyd|date=July 18, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>  Brunnermeier argued that a prime cause of this "liquidity spiral" were the frictionless models used by banks, central banks and elements of the [[Shadow banking system|shadow financial system]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_ID=14030288|title=The state of economics: The other-worldly philosophers|date=July 16, 2009|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|date=2009|title=Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|publisher=American Economic Association|volume=23|issue=1|pages=77-100|doi=10.1257/jep.23.1.77}}</ref>
