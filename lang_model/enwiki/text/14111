The '''<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line''' ({{lang-no|<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rdbanen}}) is an abandoned [[railway line]] between [[Ganddal]] and [[<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd]] in [[Rogaland]], [[Norway]]. The {{convert|12.24|km|adj=on}} line was built as a [[narrow gauge]] [[branch line]] of the [[J<U+00E6>ren Line]] and opened in 1924. It was converted to standard gauge in 1944, but passenger transport was terminated in 1955. Most of the line was abandoned in 1988, although {{convert|3|km|sp=us|0}} was used until 2001.

==Route==
[[File:Togstasjonen Figgjo.jpg|thumb|left|Figgjo Station]]
The <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line branches off at Ganddal Station on the S<U+00F8>rland Line and runs {{convert|12.24|km|sp=us}} to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd.<ref name=a227>Aspenberg (1994): 227</ref>

As of 1994, the line was intact and operational from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, and it is not possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of [[level crossing]]s where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd. At <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo has been taken over by a wholesaler.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 231</ref>

==History==

[[File:Ganddal stasjon2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ganddal Station]], where the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line branches off from the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]]]]
[[File:<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station.jpg|thumb|left|<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station, the terminus]]

The first plans to build a railway line along the route of the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line was that the S<U+00F8>rland Line was to run further east than the [[J<U+00E6>ren Line]]. However, it was instead decided that the S<U+00F8>rland Line would connect to the J<U+00E6>ren Line at [[Egersund]]. The section from Ganddal to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd was considered to have value as a local railway, so the [[Parliament of Norway]] passed construction of the line on 20 July 1921. By then, standard gauge had become the norm in Norway, and it had been decided that the S<U+00F8>rland Line was to be built in {{RailGauge|1067}} [[narrow gauge]], but everything was to be prepared for standard gauge, so that when conversion was done, only the track and the [[railroad tie|ties]] needed to be replaced. The line opened on 21 December 1924, and was the last state-owned railway in Norway to be built with narrow gauge.<ref name=a227 />

To begin with, there were one or two daily round trips with [[steam locomotive]]-hauled trains. In 1930, an [[NSB Class Cmb1]] [[diesel multiple unit]] was taken into use, and the number of daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy traffic, it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at [[Sandnes Station]]. During [[World War II]], the multiple units were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and [[NSB Class 14]] multiple units were taken into use. Until the end of the war, they ran on [[wood gas]]. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten daily round trips. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with [[NSB Class 86]] and [[NSB Class 87]] in 1953.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 228</ref>

In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated. This is the line in Norway with the most frequent passenger traffic to be closed. Freight trains remained to the various industrial companies along the line until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988 the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 230</ref>

Until 2001 only the three first kilometers of the line were used for transport of concrete structures, but then the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] stopped allowing traffic on the line. At Figgjo Station, that has been converted to a museum one in summertime can rent a [[draisine]] and cycle to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd.
