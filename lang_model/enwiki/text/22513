The '''Soyuz 7K-LOK''', or simply '''LOK''' ({{lang-ru|''Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl''}} meaning "Lunar Orbital Craft") was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spacecraft]] designed to launch men from Earth to circle the moon and developed in parallel to the [[Soyuz 7K-L1|7K-L1]]. The LOK would carry two cosmonauts into orbit around the Moon, acting as "mother" spacecraft for the [[LK Lander]], which would land one member of the crew to the surface. It was part of the [[N1-L3]] programme which also included the LK lander and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] rocket.<ref name=L3>{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=L3|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/l3.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>

==Design==
The Soyuz 7K-LOK is based on both the unmanned [[Zond]] 7K-L1 lunar flyby vehicle and the first-generation Soyuz 7K-OK earth-orbital manned spacecraft.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012|reason=Wasn't the OK based on the LOK?}} Like the 7K-OK model, the 7K-LOK was divided into three sections, an ellipsoid Orbital Module, the "headlight"-shaped Descent Module, and a cylindrical equipment module.  Like the 7K-OK, the 7K-LOK was capable of physically docking with another spacecraft, but lacked the transfer tunnel used on the [[Apollo Spacecraft]], thus forcing the cosmonaut to make a [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] from the 7K-LOK's orbital module to the LK Lander using the new [[Krechet]] space suit (the predecessor to the [[Orlan space suit]]s used today on the [[International Space Station]]).

Other changes to the 7K-LOK was the elimination of the solar panels used on the 7K-OK, replacing them with [[fuel cells]] similar to those found on the Apollo CSM.  Another feature, a "cupola" located on the Orbital Module, allowed the cosmonaut in the 7K-LOK to perform the docking procedure with the LK Lander after lunar liftoff.  Only the Descent Module from the 7K-L1, with a thicker, reinforced heatshield, is used on the 7K-LOK and like the 7K-L1, is capable of doing a "skip" reentry so that the Soyuz can be recovered in the (former) [[Soviet Union]].

The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the LOK were different from those of the Soyuz-7K. 
The Descent Module was equipped with the "Uran" control panel and the Orbital Module featured the "Orion" approach control panel.

==Flights==
Only three unmanned 7K-LOK's were flown in the short lifespan of the [[Soviet Moonshot|failed Soviet lunar program]]. 

One of them was a dummy 7K-LOK as a [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] modification of a [[Soyuz 7K-L1|Soyuz 7K-L1 "Zond"]] spacecraft and was successfully test launched into [[Low Earth Orbit]] on a [[Proton rocket]] designated as [[Kosmos 382]] (Soyuz 7K-L1E No.2) on December 2, 1970.
Two other unsuccessful launches of dummy 7K-LOK ([[Soyuz 7K-L1E No.1]]) and operational ([[Soyuz 7K-LOK No.1]]) with dummy LKs were fulfilled atop the [[N1 rocket|N-1 rocket]] in its later flights on June 26, 1971 and November 23, 1972 intended for lunar flybys. Both spacecraft were pulled and saved by the [[launch escape system]] when those boosters failed. The two aborted flights later proved that the launch-escape system worked when a similar problem on a [[Soyuz-U]] forced the [[Soyuz T-10a]] to be jettisoned with its cosmonaut crew in 1983 before the booster exploded on the launchpad, destroying it. On two early flights of the N-1, both of them failures, another [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] "Zond-M" modification of the 7K-L1 spacecraft instead of the 7K-LOK or 7K-L1E were used without the dummy LK, and they, along with the booster, were destroyed.

Subsequently, a complete L3 lunar expedition complex with an operational 7K-LOK and LK for an unmanned lunar flyby and landing mission (in preparation of a future manned scenario) was prepared for the fifth launch of a modified N1 rocket in August, 1974. However, the [[N1-L3]] program was cancelled in May, 1974 and the Soviets decided to concentrate on the development of [[space stations]], achieving several firsts in the process, which continues to the present day.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Franchetti|title=Russia plans first men on Mars|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1678539,00.html|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=2008-02-05 | location=London | date=July 3, 2005}}</ref>

==Future==
Although never flown in actual spaceflight, the planned -and discontinued- joint [[Russia]]n/[[European Space Agency|ESA]] [[CSTS|ACTS]] missions to the Moon, planned as a response to NASA's [[Project Constellation]], would have seen the resurrection, somewhat, of the 7K-LOK spacecraft, but with the current Soyuz TMA hardware (solar panels, docking & transfer system, etc.) being used.
