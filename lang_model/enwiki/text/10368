The magazine started as a cultural and literary publication by Rose al Yusuf, but became a political magazine by 1928. It had since lost its independence, functioning as a mouthpiece for the [[Hosni Mubarak]] regime prior to Mubarak's ouster from the presidency. In 1935, the publisher added a daily newspaper with the same name. Both are published in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

The circulation of the weekly in 2000 was 250,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Sahar Hegazi|author2=Mona Khalifa|title=Increasing the Coverage of Reproductive Health  Issues in Egyptian Press Project|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/frontiers/FR_FinalReports/egyptmedia.pdf|work=FRONTIERS/Population Council|accessdate=30 September 2014|date=October 2000}}</ref>
