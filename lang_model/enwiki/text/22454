'''Denny's''' (also seen as '''Denny's Diner''' on some of the locations' [[signage]]) is a full-service coffee shop/family [[restaurant chain]].  It operates over 1,600 restaurants in the [[United States]] (including [[Puerto Rico]]), [[Canada]], [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], [[Japan]] (transliterated as ''<U+30C7><U+30CB><U+30FC><U+30BA>'' {{nihongo|''Den<U+012B>zu''
}}), [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Denny's is known for always being open, serving [[breakfast]], [[lunch]], [[dinner]], and [[dessert]] around the clock. Unlike many other restaurant chains, Denny's does not close on holidays or nights, except where required by law. Many of their restaurants are located in proximity to [[freeway]] exits, bars and in service areas. Denny's started [[franchising]] in 1963, and most Denny's restaurants are now franchisee-owned. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/askchrisblog/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10382675|title=Link to Los Angeles Magazine's Ask Chris Blog|accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Richard Jezak and Harold Butler founded Denny's (as '''Danny's Donuts''') in [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]], [[California]] in 1953. Their first store opened at 4917 Bellflower Blvd. at Del Amo Blvd. in Lakewood, CA on July 30, 1954. Denny's expanded to twenty restaurants by 1959, when the chain was renamed Denny's to avoid confusion with another chain, "Coffee Dan's". The business continued to grow and by 1981, there were over 1,000 restaurants in all 50 [[U.S. state]]s. In 1977, Denny's introduced the still-popular Grand Slam breakfast. In 1994, Denny's became the largest corporate sponsor of [[Save the Children]], a national charity. All but six Denny's closed for the first time ever on [[Christmas]] 1988; many of the restaurants were built without locks, and some had reportedly lost their keys.<ref>{{cite news |title=Diner Chain Has to Buy Locks for First Holiday Closing |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The New York Times |date=December 20, 1988 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD9173BF933A15751C1A96E948260&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss }}</ref>

Denny's headquarters were located in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[California]], until 1991. At that time, the main office was moved to the [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]], headquarters of the parent company [[Trans World Corporation]] (TW Corporation) that acquired Denny's in 1987. In 1992, [[private equity]] firm, [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DD1E3BF935A15755C0A964958260 Kohlberg, Kravis Plans Stake in TW].  New York Times, June 26, 1992</ref> Eventually, Denny's operations dominated the parent company to such an extent that The Flagstar Companies changed its name again to '''Denny's Corporation'''. It now trades on the [[NASDAQ]] under the symbol DENN.

For much of its history, Denny's offered a free meal to anyone on his or her birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotional ritual ceased in 1993; though occasionally individual franchises will continue the tradition.

===The Denny's Diner prototype===
[[File:Denny'sdiner.jpg|thumb|200px||Denny's Diner in [[Bangor, Maine]], inspired by 1950s culture.]]

Some Denny's restaurants use the "Diner" concept, using modular buildings that resemble classic 1950s diners. In May 1997, the first Denny's Classic Diner was opened in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], [[Florida]]. The Diner concept was created by Ron, Marcia, Marc, and Todd York, the principals of Denny's Franchisee SWFRI, Inc. Today there are about forty Denny's Diners in the United States. In addition, there are several diners that resemble the modular buildings but are actually [[stick construction]].

===Domestic and international growth===
[[File:Tokyo Dennys.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Denny's restaurant in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]]]

In July 2010, Denny's presence in the United States saw a major expansion when [[Pilot Flying J]] started opening Denny's locations inside their Flying J-branded [[truck stop]] locations.<ref>[http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/nov/04/dennys-open-flying-j-pasco/ Denny's to open at Flying J in Pasco]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> 123 [[Pilot Flying J]] conversions were completed, making Denny's the leading full service restaurant brand in travel centers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=John C.|title=To Our Valued Shareholders|url=http://ir.dennys.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=113027&p=irol-reportsAnnual|work=Denny's Corporation 2011 Annual Report|publisher=Denny's Corporation|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref> 

As of the end of 2011 there were 1,685 total Denny's restaurants. While the company owns and operates some restaurants, the majority are operated through a [[franchising]] model. 1,593 of Denny's 1,685 restaurants are located in the 50 [[U.S. state]]s (including the [[District of Columbia]]), 11 in [[Puerto Rico]], 2 in [[Guam]], 60 in [[Canada]], 5 in [[Mexico]], 3 in [[Costa Rica]], 2 in Honduras, and 8 in [[New Zealand]]. There is also a Denny's attached to the Holiday Beach Hotel in Otrabanda, [[Willemstad]], [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] in the Netherlands [[Antilles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Denny's Corporation 2011 Annual Report|url=http://ir.dennys.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=113027&p=irol-reportsAnnual|publisher=Denny's Corporation|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>  Along with the regular Denny's Menu, the [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] restaurant offers a selection of local ("kriyoyo") dishes. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in [[Japan]] operated independently under a license by a subsidiary of [[Seven & I Holdings]].

In June of 2012, Denny's opened a location in the [[Las Am<U+00E9>ricas International Airport]], its first location in an [[airport]] and its first in the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Zacks Equity Research|title=Denny's Enters Dominican Republic|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/dennys-enters-dominican-republic-174516434.html|publisher=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref> In July of 2012, Denny's announced it had signed an agreement with a franchisee to open 50 restaurants in southern [[China]] over 15 years, beginning in 2013. This makes it Denny's largest international development deal yet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Kristin|title=Denny's Plans China Expansion in 50-Restaurant Deal|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120709-714145.html|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=9 July 2012}}</ref>

==Health inspection records==
In October 2004, [[Dateline NBC]] aired a segment titled "Dirty Dining". This segment examined the 10 most popular family and [[casual dining]] chains in the United States: [[Bob Evans Restaurants|Bob Evans]], [[Red Lobster]], [[Waffle House]], [[Chili's]], [[Ruby Tuesday (restaurant)|Ruby Tuesday]], [[International House of Pancakes|IHOP]], [[Applebee's]], [[TGI Friday's]], [[Outback Steakhouse]], and Denny's. As part of the segment, the producers examined the [[Health Inspector|health inspection]] records for 100 restaurants over 15 months and totaled all of the critical violations, or violations that can result in adverse effects to the customers' health. Denny's had the fewest violations of the 10 chains evaluated by Dateline and was the only one to average fewer than one violation per restaurant.  Denny's attributes this relative success to its adherence to the principles of [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Lea |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6083318/ |title=How safe are your favorite restaurants? - Consumer Alert - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2004-10-03 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

==Animal welfare efforts==
Denny's works with the [[Humane Society of the United States]] to address animal welfare issues. In 2008, Denny's began switching to [[cage-free]] eggs, and in 2012 the company announced that it will work with its suppliers to move away from the practice of keeping pigs in [[gestation crates]].<ref>{{cite web|last=West|first=Anna|title=Denny<U+2019>s Moves to End Gestation Crate Pig Confinement in Its Supply Chain|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2012/05/dennys_gestation_crates_pigs_051512.html|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Racial discrimination lawsuits===
During the 1990s, Denny's was involved in a series of discrimination lawsuits involving several cases of servers denying or providing inferior service to racial [[minorities]], especially black customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q7oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=denny%27s+discrimination+1990&source=bl&ots=XutScDZn0H&sig=HsxzsAl3WzTmlfR70fCqsESBYxg&hl=en&ei=h9UyTqP6JYWHsgK3xoXnCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=denny%27s%20discrimination%201990&f=false |title=Denny's Restaurants Hit With Discrimination Suit - Google News Archive Search |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

In 1994, Denny's settled a [[class action]] lawsuit filed by thousands of black customers who had been refused service, forced to wait longer, or pay more than white customers. The $54.4 million settlement was the largest and broadest under federal public-accommodations laws established thirty years previously to end segregation in restaurants and public spaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22430276.html |title=In a Surprising Act of Redemption, Denny's Becomes a Leader in - Washington Informer - HighBeam Research |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

These are some of the most notable incidents involving racial discrimination at Denny's, all occurring after the settlement:

* A black Denny's customer was told, in 1995, that he and his friends had to pay up front at the counter upon ordering their meals. He questioned the waitress: "We asked the waitress about it and she said some black guys had been in earlier who made a scene and walked out without paying their bill. So the manager now wanted all blacks to pay up front."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&p_theme=sb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0DB63812257B5&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=DENNY'S SETTLES TWO RACE SUITS SACRAMENTANS SHARE IN $46 MILLION DEAL}}</ref>
* Another 1993 incident occurred when six [[black]] [[United States Secret Service]] agents visited a Denny<U+2019>s restaurant in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. They were forced to wait an hour for service while their white companions were seated immediately upon entering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ED1VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CT4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4399,5737023&dq=denny%27s+discrimination+secret+service&hl=en |title=Secret Service accusing Denny's of discrimination - Google News Archive Search |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>
* In [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, in 1994, several black teenagers were refused service unless they agreed to pay in advance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D12FB345C0C768EDDAC0894DC494D81|title=Denny's Restaurants to Pay $54 Million in Race Bias Suits - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title --> | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=May 25, 1994 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BG/lib00065,0EADE0D6EECC1478.html |title=Boston.com Local Search - Boston Globe Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> 
* In 1997, six [[Asian-American]] students from [[Syracuse University]] visited a local Denny<U+2019>s restaurant late at night. They waited for more than half an hour as white patrons were regularly served, seated, and offered more helpings. They complained to management and to their server but were forced to leave the establishment by two security guards called by Denny<U+2019>s management. Then, according to the students, a group of white men came out of Denny's and attacked them<ref>"Syracuse U. Students Fault Police on Denny's," ''The New York Times'', August 27, 1997</ref> and shouted racial epithets. Several of the students were beaten into unconsciousness.<ref>"Federal Investigation Finds Fault at Denny's", ''AsianWeek News'', Heather Harlan, August 22, 1997 &ndash; August 28, 1997</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-736009.html |title=Bias Alleged at N.Y. Denny's - The Washington Post - HighBeam Research |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

After the $54.4 million settlement, Denny's created a racial sensitivity training program for all  employees. Denny's has also made efforts at improving its [[public relations]] image by featuring blacks in their commercials, including one featuring [[Sherman Hemsley]] and [[Isabel Sanford]], both actors from the popular ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' [[television series]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-10296200.html|title='The Jeffersons' come back for another Denny's round. &#124; ''The Business Journal'' (Serving Greater Tampa Bay) (September, 2001)<!-- Bot generated title --> | work=The Business Journal | date=September 28, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-10391793.html|title=SHERMAN HEMSLEY AND ISABEL SANFORD. &#124; Nation's Restaurant News Daily NewsFax (September, 2001)<!-- Bot generated title --> | work=Nation's Restaurant News Daily NewsFax | date=September 19, 2001}}</ref> In 2001, Denny's was chosen by [[Fortune Magazine|''Fortune'' magazine]] as the "Best Company for Minorities."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&p_theme=vp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFFBE6DAC6D20F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Virginian-Pilot Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=denny%27s+Best+Company+for+Minorities&um=1 |title=denny's Best Company for Minorities - Google News Archive Search |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref> In 2006 and 2007, Denny's topped [[Black Enterprise]]'s "Best 40 Companies for Diversity." <ref>{{cite web|title=Awards & Recognition|url=http://dennysdiversity.com/site/pages/awards.html|work=Denny's Diversity Speaks|publisher=Denny's|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>
