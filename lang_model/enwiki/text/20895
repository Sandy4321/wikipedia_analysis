'''San Agustin Church''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Iglesia de la Inmaculada Concepci<U+00F3>n de Mar<U+00ED>a de San Agust<U+00ED>n'') is a [[Roman Catholic]] church under the auspices of [[Augustinians|The Order of St. Augustine]], located inside the historic walled city of [[Intramuros, Manila|Intramuros]] in [[Manila]].

In 1993, San Agustin Church was one of four Philippine churches constructed during the [[History of the Philippines (1521<U+2013>1898)|Spanish colonial period]] to be designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]], under the collective title ''[[Baroque Churches of the Philippines]]''.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/677 "Baroque Churches of the Philippines"]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Retrieved on 2012-01-20.</ref>  It was named a National Historical Landmark by the Philippine government in 1976.<ref name=lay4/>

==History==
The present structure is actually the third Augustinian church erected on the site.<ref name=lay3>Layug, p. 83</ref> The first San Agustin Church was the first religious structure constructed by the [[Spaniards]] on the island of [[Luzon]].<ref name=ph>{{cite web |title=San Agustin Church (Intramuros, Manila) |url=http://heritageconservation.wordpress.com/2006/07/29/san-agustin-church-intramuros-manila |author=Heritage Conservation Society |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref> Made of [[bamboo]] and [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]], it was completed in 1571, but destroyed by fire in December, 1574 during the attempted invasion of Manila by the forces of [[Limahong]].<ref name=torres2>Torres, p. 62</ref><ref name=al0>Aluit, p. 40</ref> A second church made of wood was constructed on the site.<ref name=al0 /> This was destroyed in February 1583, in a fire that started when a candle set ablaze the drapes of the funeral bier during the interment of the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor-General]] [[Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe<U+00F1>alosa]].<ref name=torres2 />

The Augustinians decided to rebuild the church using stone, and to construct an adjacent [[monastery]]. Construction began in 1586, based on a design by Juan Mac<U+00ED>as.<ref name=ph /><ref name=al0 /> The structure was built using hewn [[adobe]] stones quarried from [[Meycauayan, Bulacan|Meycauayan]], [[Binangonan]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal]].<ref name=lay4 /> The work proceeded slowly due to the lack of funds and materials, as well as the relative scarcity of stone artisans.<ref name=al0 /> The monastery was operational by 1604, and the church was formally declared complete on January 19, 1607, and named '''St. Paul of Manila'''.<ref name=al0 /> Mac<U+00ED>as, who had died before the completion of the church, was officially acknowledged by the Augustinians as the builder of the edifice.<ref name=al1>Aluit, p. 41</ref>

San Agustin Church was looted by the [[Great Britain|British]] forces which occupied Manila in 1762 during the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref name=torres3>Torres, p. 63</ref> In 1854, the church was renovated under the supervision of architect Luciano Oliver.<ref name=ph />  Nine years later, on June 3, 1863, the strongest earthquake at that time, hit Manila leaving widespread destruction to the city with San Agustin Church, the only public building left undamaged in the city.<ref>Fernandez, p. 216</ref> A series of strong earthquakes struck Manila again on  18<U+2013>20 July 1880. This time, the tremors left a huge crack on the left bell tower of the church<ref>Hannaford, p. 21</ref> The crack was eventually repaired, but the left tower was permanently removed as it appears today.<ref>Laya and Gatbonton, p.102.</ref> The church withstood the other major earthquakes that struck Manila before in 1645, 1699, 1754, 1796, 1825 and 1852.

On August 18, 1898, the church was the site where Spanish Governor-General Fermin Jaudenes prepared the terms for the surrender of Manila to the United States of America following the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]].<ref name=lay3 /><ref name=torres3 />

During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during [[World War II]], San Agustin Church was turned into a concentration camp for prisoners.<ref name=lay3 /> In the final days of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], hundreds of Intramuros residents and clergy were held hostage in the church by [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese soldiers]]; many of the hostages would be killed during the three-week-long battle.<ref name=lay3 /> The church itself survived the flattening of Intramuros by combined American and Filipino ground forces in May, 1945 with only its roof damaged, the only one of the seven churches in the walled city to remain standing.<ref name=lay3 /> The adjacent monastery however was totally destroyed, and was later rebuilt in the 1970s as a museum under the design of architect Angel Nakpil.<ref name=lay4>Layug, p. 84</ref><ref name=torres3 /> The church was renovated in 2013, replacing its colorful facade with a mature stone-colored one.

== Architecture ==
The San Agustin Church is patterned after some of the magnificent temples built by the Augustinians in Mexico, its present edifice was built in 1587, and completed, together with the monastery, in 1604.The atmosphere is medieval since "both church and monastery symbolize the majesty and equilibrium of a Spanish golden era."

The massive structure of the church, the symmetry and splendor of the interiors (painted by two Italians who succeeded in producing trompe l'oeil), the profile of the mouldings, rosettes and sunken panels which appear as three-dimensional carvings, a baroque pulpit with the native pineapple as a motif, the grand pipe organ, the antechoir with a 16th-century crucifix, the choir seats carved in molave with ivory inlays of the 17th century and the set of 16 huge and beautiful chandeliers from Paris.<ref>{{cite book|title=Landmarks of Manila: 1571<U+2013>1930|last=de la Torre|first=Visitacion|publisher=Filipinas Foundation, Inc.|year=1981|location=Makati|pages=63<U+2013>64}}</ref>
