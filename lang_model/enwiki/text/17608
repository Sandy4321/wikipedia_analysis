'''''AstroPop''''' is a real-time [[computer puzzle game]] developed and published by [[PopCap Games]].  Players can play the [[Macromedia Flash]] version online for free at several different websites, or a deluxe version can be downloaded and unlocked for a fee. The game can also be found on both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the [[Xbox Live Arcade]], where it can be purchased for 800 [[Microsoft Points]]. The game has also been ported to cell phones, although the controls are simplified and one of the characters (Vixx) has been omitted.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to clear a certain number of bricks in each level in order to fill up the ''Brick-O-Meter''.  Players control a ship which moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.  The ship can grab and release bricks (up to 6 of the same-colored bricks at a time), moving them from one column to another.  If the player releases bricks such that 4 of more bricks of the same color are touching, the bricks explode.  As bricks explode, the bricks below move up to fill in the gaps.  If this causes 4 or more bricks of the same color to meet, they too will automatically explode (referred to as a ''combo'').

New rows of bricks continuously arrive from the top of the screen, at a rate directly proportional to the level of play.  The game ends when any column of bricks touches the bottom.

==Reception==
Most reviews of the game indicated that, while somewhat similar to existing offerings, it offered enough new elements to be worth playing.  In a review of the Xbox 360 version, [[TeamXbox]] concluded that "''AstroPop'' offers enough fun in its gameplay and design to warrant the purchase."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1170/Astropop/p1/ | title=Astropop Review (Xbox 360) | last=Ahearn | first=Nate | publisher=TeamXbox | date=2006-05-03}}</ref>  This resulted in the title receiving a score of 8.0 out of 10.  [[GameSpot]], reviewing the [[mobile phone|mobile]] version of the title, felt that it played well and that it "should appeal to virtually every mobile gamer out there", resulting in a score of 8.5 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/mobile/puzzle/astropop/review.html | title=AstroPop for Mobile Review | last=Palley | first=Steve | publisher=GameSpot | date=2005-07-06}}</ref>
