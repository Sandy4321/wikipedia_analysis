"'''Marry the Night'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released as the fifth and final single from her second [[studio album]], ''[[Born This Way]]'' (2011). The song was written and produced by Lady Gaga and [[Fernando Garibay]], and was recorded on the tour bus during [[The Monster Ball Tour]] with Garibay. Revealed in February 2011, the song was inspired by the energy of Gaga's previous song "[[Dance in the Dark]]" and the love for her hometown, [[New York City]]. The song was released for promotion on [[Farmville]], six days before the release of ''Born This Way''.

"Marry the Night" is a [[dance-pop]] song influenced by [[Electronic rock|electro rock]] and [[House music|house]]. The track features electronic church bells, a driving [[Electro (music)|electro]] organ sound, [[techno]] beats and a [[funk rock]] influenced [[break (music)|breakdown]]. The lyrics are a tribute to Gaga's love of the nightlife and partying, while serving as a homage to her hometown. "Marry the Night" received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its grand and euphoric dance nature. They furthermore found influences of Italian disco music producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] and American rock musician [[Bruce Springsteen]] in the song. After the release of ''Born This Way'', "Marry the Night" charted in some nations due to digital sales from the parent album.

Gaga directed the music video, which was filmed in [[New York City]]. It tells the story of when she was signed by her label [[Interscope Records]] after being dropped from her former record label, [[Def Jam Recordings]], with scenes in a clinic, a dance studio, her own New York apartment and on a car's rooftop at a parking lot. She sports outfits by [[Calvin Klein Collection]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[St<U+00E9>phane Rolland]]. Prior to its release, the music video was teased with video stills and previews. Critics wrote positively on the clip, deeming it creative and ambitious, while lauding its narrative theme. Gaga has performed the song in India's [[Formula One]], the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]],  ''[[The X Factor (UK)]]'' and others. She also recorded an acoustic version for her [[Thanksgiving Day (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] special, ''[[A Very Gaga Thanksgiving]]''.

"Marry the Night" was written by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Fernando Garibay]] while on the road for [[The Monster Ball Tour]], and was [[record producer|produced]] by both. It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, ''[[Born This Way]]'', [[Ryan Seacrest]]'s [[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|radio show]], where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/02/15/lady-gaga-whitney-houston-was-my-vocal-idol-growing-up-audio/|title=Lady Gaga: Whitney Houston Was My Vocal Idol Growing Up|last=Seacrest|first=Ryan|authorlink=Ryan Seacrest|work=[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song "[[Dance in the Dark]]" (2009), from Gaga's previous release, ''[[The Fame Monster]]''. Before starting work on "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to "Dance in the Dark" and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. "I remember being backstage and hearing the concert start, so I go out there and hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that feeling. I wanted to outdo that moment that opens up the show. I'm just that way."<ref name="insideoutside"/>

Wanting to have a new style of music, Gaga made it clear she did not want her fans to like the song. She wanted to write a song that could define where she was with ''Born This Way'' and her life.<ref name="insideoutside"/> In an interview with ''[[NME]]'', Gaga explained that the main inspiration behind the song was singer Whitney Houston and also added: "This song is about me going back to New York. I wrote this about the courage it took for me to say 'I hate Hollywood, I just wanna live in Brooklyn and make music'".<ref name="nme">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Peter|date=April 23, 2011|title=Freak Or Fraud?

As Gaga performed on The Monster Ball Tour, Garibay started working on the music of the song. After the show was over, Gaga came back to her studio bus and asked him about the progress.<ref name="insideoutside"/> Garibay then explained that he had concocted a different kind of music for the song, and played the church-bell inspired music to Gaga. After first hearing it, the singer said that she started to cry, noticing the vastness of the music, and she started writing the lyrics for "Marry the Night".<ref name="insideoutside">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1664761/lady-gaga-marry-the-night-fernando-garibay.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga 'Started To Cry' When She First Heard 'Marry the Night'|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref> "Marry the Night" was originally recorded on the Bus Studio in 2010, but was later [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] at The Mix Room in [[Burbank, California]] by Dave Russell, assisted by Paul Pavao.<ref name="credits"/> Gaga described the song as a "massive, gas-station, disco record", and she recorded it immediately after completing the lyrics.<ref name="insideoutside"/><ref name="bbcover"/> According to Garibay, Gaga meditated for a few minutes and then asked him to hand over a recording [[microphone]] to her, completing the process within an hour.<ref name="nme"/>

===Synopsis===
[[File:Marry-The-Night video.JPG|thumb|left|Scene from Marry the Night music video, which some critics felt it referenced Madonna's ''Desperately Seeking Susan''.]]
The autobiographical story begins as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner monologue about her past memories is heard.<ref name="vf">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/11/lady-gaga-marry-the-night-music-video|title=Lady Gaga Discusses New 'Marry the Night' Video with Vanity Fair|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> The nurses wear [[Calvin Klein Collection]] uniforms and [[Giuseppe Zanotti]] shoes.<ref name="vf" /> A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims that her mother was a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo.<ref name="vf" /> [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s "[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 8]]" plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/12/marry-the-night-video-lady-gagas-origin-story.html|first=Amanda|last=Dobbins|title='Marry the Night' Video: Lady Gaga Writes an Origin Story, Takes a Cheerio Bath|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref> Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by [[St<U+00E9>phane Rolland]] and taken to bed,<ref name=vf/> but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, "But I still had my [[bedazzler]] and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do<U+2014>I did it all over again."<ref name="mtvmtn">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1675265/lady-gaga-marry-the-night-premiere.jhtml|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|title=Lady Gaga's 'Marry The Night' Video: Dance Therapy|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in the film ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]''.<ref name="mtvmtn" /> Gaga's dancers look down at her from a [[mezzanine]] as the clock chimes.

The video later shifts to a night scene on a building rooftop, where half of Gaga's body is inside a car, while her legs protrude from the window and onto the roof of the car. She has blonde hair and wears a black plastic leather outfit.<ref name="mtvmtn" /> She gets her full body into the car, kissing a "Marry the Night" tape and inserting it into the audio player. The song begins playing as Gaga smokes on the driver's seat. As the chorus begins, vehicles in the background explode aflame and Gaga exits the car and dances. In a new dance studio setting as the second verse begins, Gaga enters with her dancers, and warms up to do an intricate choreography during the chorus with her team. During the bridge, she and her dance team take a break and warm up to perform another choreography. The rooftop car parking scene and a bath scene intersperse. Gaga and her dancers repeat the choreography  during the final chorus, as one dancers falls and is helped up by Gaga. During the breakdown, Gaga and her team dance on a street while interspersing scenes show her causing chaos, including falling down the stairs, attempting to get into a car with an ridiculously oversized hat and pouring water over herself with a marble plant pot in the bath. She enters a car and reveals "Interscope Records; Hollywood, CA; 4&nbsp;p.m." written on her palm.<ref name="mtvmtn" /> The last scene shows Gaga in couture and surrounded by flames.<ref name="mtvmtn" /> The video ends with Gaga suddenly vanishing.

===Reception and analysis===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote="It's a succinct summary of Gaga's aesthetic, but the video itself is a sprawling epic, with the song preceded by several minutes of cheeky, artsy psycho-drama set in a mental health clinic. There's ballet, nudity, fashion from the future, French dialogue, cars on fire, a little bit of weeping, and lots and lots of dancing. Even compared to other Gaga video epics, this one seems particularly crazy and ambitious."|source=<U+2014>''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Matthew Perpetua talking about the video for "Marry the Night".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-marry-the-night-20111202|title=Video: Lady Gaga 'Marry the Night'|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|first=Matthew|last=Perpetua|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref>}}
