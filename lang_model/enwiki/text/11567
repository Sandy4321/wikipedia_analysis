'''Ranavalona I''' (born '''Rabodoandrianampoinimerina (Ramavo)'''; c. 1778 &ndash; 16 August 1861), also known as '''Ranavalo-Manjaka I''', was a sovereign of the [[Kingdom of Madagascar]] from 1828 to 1861. After positioning herself as queen following the untimely death of her young husband, [[Radama I]], Ranavalona pursued a policy of [[autarky]] (self-sufficiency) and [[isolationism]], diminishing economic and political ties with European powers, repelling a French attack on the coastal town of Foulepointe, and taking vigorous measures to eradicate the small but growing Malagasy Christian movement initiated under Radama I by members of the [[London Missionary Society]]. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of ''fanompoana'' (forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods) to complete public works projects and build a standing army of between 20,000-30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand her realm. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice throughout the island resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign.

Although greatly obstructed by Ranavalona's policies, French and British interests in [[Madagascar]] remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries leveraged to attempt to hasten the succession of her son, [[Radama II]]. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the [[Joseph-Fran<U+00E7>ois Lambert#Lambert Charter|Lambert Charter]] he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plots were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until Ranavalona's natural death in 1861 at the age of 83. 

Ranavalona's European contemporaries generally condemned her policies and characterized her as a tyrant at best and insane at worst. These negative characterizations persisted in Western scholarly literature until the mid-1970s. Recent research, however, has recast Ranovalona's actions as those of a queen attempting to expand her realm while protecting Malagasy sovereignty against the encroachment of European cultural and political influence, a concern that ultimately proved only too valid upon French colonization of Madagascar in 1896.

== Early life ==
Princess Ramavo was born in 1778 at the royal residence at Ambatomanoina,<ref name = royalarc>{{Cite web | last = Buyers | first = Christopher | title = The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty | url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/madagascar1.htm | accessdate = February 3, 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wErqO8WQ |archivedate = February 3, 2011}}</ref> about 15 kilometers east of [[Antananarivo]],<ref>{{Cite web |title = Tombeaux royaux: Ambatomanoina | url=http://madatana.com/tombeau-ambatomanoina.php | accessdate = February 3, 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wErmMHfW |archivedate = February 3, 2011}}</ref> to Prince Andriantsalamanjaka (Andrianavalontsalama) and Princess Rabodonandriantompo.<ref name = royalarc/> When Ramavo was still a young girl, her father alerted King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787-1810) to a murderous plot against him by [[Andrianjafy]], the king's uncle, whom Andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of [[Ambohimanga]]. In return, Andrianampoinimerina betrothed Ramavo to his son, [[Radama I|Radama]]; before he died, the king designated Radama as his heir and declared that any child from this union would be first in the line of succession after Radama. However, despite her elevated rank among the royal wives, Ramavo was not the preferred wife of Radama and did not bear him any children. The relationship between Radama and Ramavo may have been strained by the execution of a number of Ramavo's relatives to secure Radama's succession following Andrianampoinimerina's death.<ref name = "army"/>

===Accession to the throne===
When Radama died without leaving any descendants on July 27 1828, according to the local matrilineal custom, the rightful heir was Rakotobe, the eldest son of Radama's eldest sister; an intelligent and amiable young man, Rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the [[London Missionary Society]] in Antananarivo on the grounds of the [[Rova of Antananarivo|royal palace]].<ref name = "army"/> Radama died in the company of two trusted attendants who were favorable to the succession of Rakotobe. However, these attendants hesitated to report the news of Radama's death for several days, fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king's rivals, whose family had a stake in succession after Radama. During this time, another attendant discovered the truth and discreetly transmitted the information to Radama's head wife, Ramavo. She contacted two colonels from her home village and promised them several rewards for their loyalty and assistance in taking the throne. These soldiers hid Ramavo and one of her friends in a safe location, then visited judges and the keepers of the ''sampy'' (royal idols) to secure the support of these influential power brokers. Their loyalty assured, the soldiers were then able to rally the army behind Ramavo,<ref name = "army"/> such that on August 3 when she declared herself successor to Radama<ref name = royalarc/> on the pretense that he himself had decreed it, there could be no immediate resistance. Ramavo took the throne name Ranavalona ("folded", "kept aside"), then systematically captured and put to death her political rivals, including Rakotobe, his family and other members of Radama's family, much as Radama had done to the queen's own family upon his succession to the throne.<ref name = "army"/> Her coronation ceremony took place more than a year after the death of Radama, on August 12, 1829.<ref name = royalarc/>

==Reign==
Ranavalona's 33-year reign was distinguished by an ongoing struggle to preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of Madagascar in the face of increasing European influence and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first putting an end to a friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the Christian religion. By the mid-1830s, she would forbid the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population and oblige the departure of foreigners from her territory. Putting an end to most foreign trade relationships, the queen pursued a policy of [[autarky]], made possible through heavy reliance on the long-standing tradition of ''fanompoana'' - forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods. Ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor, Radama I, in an effort to expand her realm over the entire island, and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will. Due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns, high death rate among ''fanompoana'' workers, and harsh traditions of justice under her rule, the population of Madagascar is estimated to have dropped from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833-1839, and from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829-1842 in Imerina,<ref name="Stats"/> contributing to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalona's rule in historical accounts.<ref name="laidler"/>

===Expansion of realm===
Queen Ranavalona continued the military incursions initiated under Radama I to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to Merina rule. These policies had a strongly negative effect on economic and population growth during her reign. ''Fanampoana'' labor among the population of Imerina could include conscription into the military, enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers.<ref name = "army">{{Cite book | last = Freeman | first = Joseph John |coauthors = Johns, David | title = A narrative of the persecution of the Christians in Madagascar: with details of the escape of six Christian refugees now in England | publisher = J. Snow | location = Berlin | date = 1840 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rAMNAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = February 5, 2011}}</ref> This army, which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces, exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to Merina domination; mass executions were common, and those who were spared their lives were commonly brought back to Imerina as slaves (''andevo'') and their valuables seized as booty to increase the wealth of the Crown.  

The number of non-Merina who died in violent conflict during the military campaigns of Ranavalona and her predecessor Radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000; additionally, a considerable proportion of the population not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces would eventually die from famine as a consequence of [[scorched earth]] policies.<ref name="Stats">{{Cite journal | last = Campbell |first = Gwyn | title = The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar | journal =  Journal of African History | volume = 23 |issue = 3 | pages = 415-445 | date = October 1991}}</ref> Deaths among the Merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high, estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820-1853. In addition, 25-50% of the queen's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have died each year due to diseases such as malaria; a prevalent disease in the coastal parts of the island, but uncommon in the high-altitude zone around Antananarivo, Merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it.<ref name="Stats"/> An average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of Ranavalona's reign, contributing to severe depopulation in Imerina.<ref name="Stats"/>

====Tangena ordeal====
One of the chief measures by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of ''tangena''. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native ''tangena'' (''Tanghinia venenifera'') shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles (''andriana'') or freemen (''hova'') were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects.<ref name="Stats"/> Among members of the slave class (''andevo''), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to reproduce all three pieces of skin indicated guilt.<ref name="history"/> According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, the ''tangena'' ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.<ref name="Stats"/> 

Citizens frequently accused one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, and for every accusation the ordeal was obligatory. On average, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of those who underwent the ordeal died. In the 1820s, ''tangena'' caused about 1,000 deaths annually, while this average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died from ''tangena'', constituting roughly 20 percent of the population. The ordeal was outlawed in 1863, but it continued to be practiced secretly in Imerina and openly in other parts of the island.<ref name="Stats"/>

===Government===
Throughout her reign, the queen's chief ministers were also her consorts. Her first chief adviser was a young army officer from [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Namehana|Namehana]] named Andriamihaja, who served as First Minister from 1829 to 1830. Major-General Andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen's only son, Prince Rakoto (later [[Radama II of Madagascar|King Radama II]]),<ref name="Africa">{{Cite book | last = Ade Ajayi | first = Jacob Festus  | title = Africa in the Nineteenth Century until the 1880s | publisher = UNESCO | location = Paris| date = 1989 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sMpMuJalFKoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate = February 3, 2011}}</ref> who was born eleven months after the death of his official father, King Radama I.<ref name="history"/> In the early years of Ranavalona's reign, Andriamihaja was the leader of the progressive faction within her court who favored Radama's pro-European foreign policy; the conservative faction was led by the brothers Rainimaharo and Rainiharo, the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal ''sampy'' - talismans that were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the [[Merina]] since at least the 16th century reign of [[Ralambo]]. The conservative faction conspired to reduce Andriamahaja's progressive influence over the queen, and in September 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason.<ref name = royalarc/> He was immediately captured in his home and killed.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Various | title = Madagascar: Its Mission and Its Martyrs | publisher = Tomlin Press | location = New York | date = 2008 | isbn = 1443708291, 9781443708296}}</ref> 

With Andriamihaja's death, the influence of Radama's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court, who grew ever closer to the queen, eventually resulting in Ranavalona's marriage to conservative figurehead Field Marshal Ravoninahitriniarivo (also known as [[Rainiharo]]) of [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Ilafy|Ilafy]] in 1833. Rainiharo - whose father, Andriantsilavonandriana, was a [[Hova]] (a free citizen of non-aristocratic birth) having exceptionally been accorded the privilege of acting as counselor to King Andrianampoinimerina - served as the queen's First Minister from 1830 to 1832, then Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief from 1832 to 1852.<ref name = royalarc/> Upon Rainiharo's death, the queen wed another conservative, Field Marshal Andrianisa (Rainijohary), who remained her husband until the queen's death in 1861. He served as Prime Minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to Ambohimanga for his part in a plot against the queen's son, Radama II.<ref name = royalarc/> Under the influence of her conservative ministers, the queen's tolerance of Christianity and European influence rapidly diminished.<ref name="Africa"/>

=== Preservation of sovereignty ===
Ranavalona's reign was marked by a struggle between [[France]] and [[England]] to secure control over [[Madagascar]].<ref name="Autarky">{{Cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Gwyn | title = The Adoption of Autarky in Imperial Madagascar, 1820-1835 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 395-411 | date = 1987}}</ref>  The French, who held several small islands off Madagascar, were interested in gaining control over the main island but this move was opposed by the British who had an interest in maintaining a safe passage to [[India]]. Ranavalona pursued a policy of autarky that sought to severely limit the interference of these foreign powers.  To this end, she revoked the Anglo-Merina friendship treaty signed by her predecessor Radama I that had, in her view, given England too strong an influence over political, economic and social affairs within her state.  

One consequence of the termination of the Anglo-Merina friendship treaty was an end to the delivery of British weaponry, which rendered the queen vulnerable to designs against her from foreign powers and pockets of local resistance alike. A French attack on Foulepoint in 1829 was successfully repelled but underscored the need to secure adequate arms for self-defense.<ref name="history"/>  It came to the Queen's attention that Frenchman [[Jean Laborde]], shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832, was knowledgeable in the production of cannons, muskets and gun powder. Ranavalona provided him with the manpower and resources to establish factories to meet the material needs of her army, thereby liberating the kingdom from dependence upon Europe for modern weaponry.<ref name="history">{{Cite book |last=Oliver |first=Samuel |title=Madagascar: An historical and descriptive account of the island and its former dependencies.

====Repression of Christianity====
Ranavalona swore to uphold customary rites and traditional beliefs and to defend her realm from the encroachment of European powers.<ref name="Autarky"/>  The queen grew wary of foreigners' influence on the island and demanded the departure of any foreigner not able to make what she deemed a valuable contribution to her country.  Ranavalona was especially suspicious of the political and cultural effects of Christianity, which she saw as leading the Malagasy to forsake the ancestors and their traditions.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Larson | first = Pier | title = Capacities and modes of thinking: Intellectual engagements and subaltern hegemony in the early history of Malagasy Christianity | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 96-1002 | date = 1997}}</ref> Bloch (1986) explains, <blockquote>"Christianity involved a repudiation of the ancestral customs of the country, established by previous monarchs who were her ancestors.  The queen's legitimacy depended entirely on her relation to her predecessors, who had given the kingdom to her.  Furthermore... she was queen because she was the descendant of the royal ancestors, who were in a mystical sense the ancestors of all the Merina. To deny her mystical power was to repudiate not only her but also the ancestors, the quintessence of good and blessings... She was the custodian of a holy trust... Christianity was therefore treason... in Ranavalona's words it was 'the substitution of the respect of her ancestors, Andrianampoinimerina and Radama, for the respect of the ancestor of the whites: Jesus Christ.'  She saw the introduction of a new religion as a political act, and there is no doubt that she was right." <ref>{{Cite book | last = Bloch | first = Maurice | title = From blessing to violence: history and ideology in the circumcision ritual of the Merina of Madagascar | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, U.K. | date = 1986 | page = 18-19 | isbn =  0521314046, 9780521314046 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sx4CKG1XiwwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = February 6, 2011}}</ref><br/></blockquote>

In a ''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]'' (formal speech) on February 26, 1835, Queen Ranavalona formally forbade the practice of Christianity among her subjects. In her discourse, she was careful to differentiate between her own people, for whom the new religion was forbidden and its practice a capital offense, and foreigners, to whom she permitted freedom of religion and conscience. She furthermore acknowledged the valuable intellectual and technological contributions that European missionaries had made to the advancement of her country, and invited them to continue working for the advancement of the country on the condition that their proselytizing would cease<ref name = "Koschorko"/>: 

<blockquote>"To the English or French strangers: I thank you for the good that you have done in my land and my kingdom, where you have made known European wisdom and knowledge.  Do not worry yourselves<U+2014>I will not change the customs and rites of our ancestors.  Nevertheless, whoever breaks the laws of my kingdom will be put to death<U+2014>whoever he may be.

Concerning you, foreigners, you can practice according to your own manners and customs.

The missionaries of the London Missionary Society, whose primary activity was teaching literacy at their newly-established schools using the Bible as the only Malagasy-language text, were obliged to leave. Several years thereafter, in the spirit of solidarity they were joined by [[James Cameron (missionary)|James Cameron]] and other artisan missionaries with diverse practical skills who had long enjoyed positive relations with the Merina monarchy and had made many significant contributions to the industrialization of the island since their arrival in the 1820s.<ref name="Autarky"/>

Pursuant to the public decree above, those who possessed a Bible, worshiped in congregation or continued to profess adherence to Christianity were fined, jailed, put in chains or other punishments, subjected to trial by ordeal, or executed.<ref name = Sunday>{{Citation | last = Cousins | first = W.E. | contribution = Since 1800 in Madagascar | year = 1877-78 |volume = 1 | title = The Sunday Magazine for Family Reading | pages = 405-410 | place = London | publisher = Daldy, Isbister & Co}}</ref><ref name="history"/> Lurid accounts of the execution and torture of Christians were reported by missionaries who placed emphasis on what they perceived as the savagery of the Queen's actions.<ref name="laidler">{{cite book |author= Keith Laidler |title= Female Caligula: Ranavalona, the Mad Queen of Madagascar |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |location = London |year = 2005 | ISBN = 0470022264, 9780470022269}}</ref>  For instance, they reported the public execution of fifteen Christian leaders near the Queen's palace who had been dangled on ropes 150 feet above a rock-filled ravine, only to have their ropes cut upon refusal to recant their profession of Christian faith.

A conservative estimate places the number executed at between sixty and eighty. Far more, however, were punished in other ways: many were required to undergo the ''tangena'' ordeal, while others were condemned to hard labor or the confiscation of their land and property, and many of these consequently died. Persecution of Christians intensified in 1840, 1849 and 1857; in 1849, deemed the worst of these years by British missionary to Madagascar W.E. Cummins (1878), 1,900 people were fined, jailed or otherwise punished in relation to their Christian faith, including 18 executions.<ref name = Sunday/>

====Foreign plots====
Ranavalona's foreign contemporaries strongly condemned the queen's policies and viewed them as the actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s.<ref name="Berg">{{Cite journal | last = Berg | first = Gerald | title = Writing Ideology: Ranavalona, the Ancestral Bureaucrat | journal = History in Africa | volume = 22 | pages = 73-92 | date = 1995}}</ref> The French were especially eager to hasten Radama II's succession in the interest of capitalizing on the Lambert Charter, an 1855 agreement between French representative [[Joseph-Fran<U+00E7>ois Lambert]] and Radama that could only come into effect upon the prince's succession. The charter guaranteed Lambert and his business associates first rights to the exploitation of many of the island's commodities and natural resources. According to a British account, Lambert conspired with Jean Laborde and local leaders to persuade Radama II to sign a document written in French<U+2014>a language in which the prince was not fluent<U+2014>which Lambert orally translated as containing only an account of the excessive pressures the Queen's policies were placing on her subjects. Radama, who was sympathetic toward the commoners and desirous to ease their burden but suspicious about the letter's true purpose, reluctantly signed the document under intense pressure from the French.  He was not told the letter included a request for French military intervention that could have potentially brought Madagascar under French rule. France, however, did not intend to take such an action without the accord of their ally, Britain, whose influence had been so well-established on the island, and refused to intercede on behalf of the prince. In the meantime, Radama, who had been made to swear on the Bible not to speak of the letter to anyone, had grown so concerned about the outcome of the letter that he contacted a British diplomat, thereby revealing the true circumstances under which the letter had been signed; the British refused to cooperate in the French plot, and an attack was averted.<ref name="Mada"/> According to Lambert, however, the prince had indeed been an enthusiastic partner in the bid to end Ranavalona's reign, and his own true feelings about the endeavor had been deliberately misrepresented through a British campaign of propaganda.<ref name="Ida"/>

Having failed to gain the backing of a European state power to place Radama on the throne and bring the treaty into effect, Lambert traveled to Ranavalona's court in May 1857 in the company of the celebrated 19th-century Austrian globetrotter [[Ida Pfeiffer]], who became an unwitting observer to the plot. She documented her perspective on these events in one of her late works.<ref name="Ida">{{Cite  | last = Pfeiffer | first = Ida | title = The last travels of Ida Pfeiffer: inclusive of a visit to Madagascar | publisher = Harper | location = London | date = 1861 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = February 6, 2011}}</ref> According to Pfeiffer, Radama and Lambert had planned to dethrone the queen on June 20, when ministers and soldiers loyal to Radama would infiltrate the Rova grounds and declare their support of a transition and loyalty to the prince. Pfeiffer blamed the failure of the plot on [[Rainivoninahitriniony]], then Commander-in-Chief of the army who reportedly had been unable to ensure the presence of soldiers in the courtyard who were loyal to Radama. According to a British account, however, Radama himself was credited with warning the queen of the plot, in which his cooperation was merely a ploy to entrap the conspirators. This British view claims that Ranavalona deliberately allowed the plot to unfold almost to its conclusion in order to ascertain the loyalties of her members of government.<ref name="Mada"/> The European party were largely confined to their houses on the palace grounds and kept from receiving visitors, until an order was issued to immediately and permanently quit the queen's territory in late July.

== Succession and death ==
While the queen had designated her son, Radama II, as her successor, Rainimaharo and the conservative faction knew of his progressive leanings and tried instead to ensure the queen's nephew, Ramboasalama, would come to power and maintain loyalties to them and their political agenda.<ref name="Africa"/> Reportedly, Ramboasalama spent a considerable sum of money in an unsuccessful bid to buy the support of others in court.<ref name="Mada">{{Cite book | last = Oliver | first = Samuel  | title = Madagascar: An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Island and its Former Dependencies, Volume 1 | publisher = Macmillan and Co. | location = New York | date = 1886|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lKtBAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate = February 3, 2011}}</ref> The progressive brothers [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] and [[Rainilaiarivony]], who were the queen's co-prime minister and head of the army respectively at the time of her death, supported the succession of Radama and were able to exercise greater influence than Ramboasalama, particularly in ensuring the support of the army for the prince's claim to the throne. As Ranavalona lay on her death bed, Radama took precautions to ensure his succession would be uncontested, surrounding his residence at the Rova of Antananarivo with several hundred soldiers and sending a member of Ramboasalama's family to bring him to the Rova to swear a public oath of allegiance to the new king, to whom he submitted.<ref name="Africa"/>

Ranavalona died in her sleep on 16 August 1861 after a rule of 33 years, having successfully resisted the attempts of the colonial powers to gain control of the island.<ref name="history"/>  Twelve thousand zebu were slaughtered and their meat distributed to the populace in her honor, and the official mourning period lasted nine months. Her body was laid in a coffin made of silver [[piastre]]s in a tomb at the royal city of Ambohimanga.
