'''''Anarchy Online''''' is an online role playing video game published by [[Funcom|Funcom Productions]].  Funcom is also known for its ''[[The Longest Journey]]'', ''[[Dreamfall]]'', and ''[[Age of Conan]]'' titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.funcom.com/wsp/funcom/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&func_id=1006&table=PUBLISH&item=1006 |title=Funcom Games |accessdate=2008-08-19 |publisher=[[Funcom]]}}</ref>  Development of the [[science fiction]] themed game was lead by project director Gaute Godager and story developer [[Ragnar T<U+00F8>rnquist]] at a time when most role playing games made use of the more common [[fantasy]] setting.<ref name=scifi_theme/><ref name=7year/>

As a [[MMORPG|Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game]] (MMORPG), customers [[Login|log on]] to a virtual world that persists indefinitely with or without player interaction. Players create unique characters that they improve by killing enemies, collecting resources, fighting each other, and various other activities. The game's ongoing [[storyline]] takes place on the fictional planet Rubi-Ka, and its extra-dimensional twin.<ref name=game_manual>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF}}</ref>

After ''Anarchy Online'''s release in June 2001, a number of [[Server (computing)|server]]-stability and registration issues negatively affected public perception of the game.<ref name=rev_ign_orig>{{cite web | first =IGN Staff | title =Anarchy Online |publisher =[[IGN]] | date =2001-08-21 | url =http://pc.ign.com/articles/161/161500p1.html | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/pc/reviews/anarchy-online--the-notum-wars-716b0c.html |title=Anarchy Online: The Notum Wars|accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Yahoo|Yahoo! UK and Ireland]]}}</ref> Those problems prevented many customers from registering or accessing content for several weeks afterward. The game and its [[Expansion Pack|expansions packs]] have since received praise from most reviewers, not least the ''Shadowlands'' expansion which was awarded with several ''Editor's Choice'' awards.<ref name=rev_ign_sl>{{cite web | last =Morrison | first =Craig | title =Anarchy Online: Shadowlands (PC) | publisher =[[IGN]] | date =2003-08-18 | url =http://pc.ign.com/articles/450/450381p1.html | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref><ref name=rev_gspot_sl>{{cite web | last =Park | first =Andrew | title =Anarchy Online: Shadowlands Review | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | date =2003-10-04 | url =http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/anarchyonlineshadowlands/review.html | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref>

==Gameplay==
The [[Gameplay]] of ''Anarchy Online'' is based on the same features as many of its predecessors in the MMORPG genre of games.<ref name=rev_gspot_orig/> Players assume the roles of newly arrived colonists to planet Rubi-Ka where they create unique virtual characters based on two genders, four species, and 14 different [[Character class|professions]] such as Agent or Doctor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=9-15}}</ref> They then choose to align themselves with either the Omni-Tek corporation, the rebel Clans, or to remain neutral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=53}}</ref> There is no specific goal that must be realized to win the game, nor is there any rigid gameplay structure. Instead, the general objective of the game is to continually improve the abilities of characters by acquiring items and killing enemies. The status of any one character is measured in 220 consecutive "levels" reached as [[experience points]] are earned in a variety of ways. 

As players earn experience and gain levels, they are able to increase the [[Skill (role-playing)|skills]] of their characters through the game's three distinct skill systems. The first base system awards characters with a number of points after reaching each new level. These points are spent to improve skills of their choice. Although many are intended for particular professions, none of the 83 available skills are denied outright to any character.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=30}}</ref> "Perks" are a second skill system introduced with the ''Shadowlands'' and ''Alien Invasion'' expansions. Perk points are rewarded to the player at specific milestones during their progression. They are chosen from tiered groups which augment specific types of base skills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=48}}</ref> Research, the third system, was introduced with the ''Lost Eden'' expansion. Players may opt to designate a percentage of their earned experience toward either personal or game-wide research projects. Augmented base skills and abilities are rewarded as research projects are completed.<ref name=le_stuff>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/p26494.htm |title=Anarchy Online: Lost Eden Preview |accessdate=2008-09-20 |publisher=[[GameZone]] | date=2005}}</ref>

A variety of items can be acquired, at cost of by effort, to further improve characters. Each character has a number of slots representing areas of the body, such as "Left-Arm" and "Head," in which items can be worn. The minimum skill requirements must be met to wear any given item.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=41}}</ref> In addition to common items types like "armor" and "weapons," the game also provides slots for "nano controller units" and "implants." Nano controller units act as a finite pool for players to store skill bonuses in. The more units characters have, the more powerful bonuses that they can make use of.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=43}}</ref> Implants are items worn "under the skin" that give skill bonuses and in some cases new abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=68}}</ref> The slots available for implants are generally the same as for regular armor.

[[Image:AnarchyOnline-AI-Screenshot.JPG|180px|thumb|left|The Outzone Playfields, a group of encounters that require large numbers of players to complete]]

Players can take part in the game's content either alone, in small temporary teams, as part of a formal organization, or any combination of the three.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=72}}</ref> Organizations are semi-permentant groups, similar to [[Clan_(computer_gaming)|clans]] in other multi-player games, where players band together for their mutual benefit. The creator and leader of the organization chooses its name, and the governing style used to delegate privileges within such as feudalism, monarchy, departmental, etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=75-77}}</ref> Organizations may also purchase city plots located throughout the game world and place prefabricated buildings on them. These buildings offer a wide range of benefits including skill bonuses, ease of transportation, [[Roleplay|role-playing]] venues, and personal automated shops to help members sell items more easily. Non-members can use the "Global Market Search" interface as an in-game search engine for these shop buildings, finding items marked for sale by others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/anarchy/frontend/files/CONTENT/gameguide.pdf |title=Game Manual |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |format=PDF | pages=85-98}}</ref>

In addition to killing creatures spread about the game world, players also attempt [[Quest (gaming)|quests]] or missions to gain experience. Missions are indoor collections of enemies generated dynamically on-demand by the player with options such as how difficult it will be, which tactics players prefer to use, and whether enemies are more likely to be humanoid or creatures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/anarchyonline/news.html?sid=6025538&mode=news |title=Anarchy Online gets mission overhaul |accessdate=2008-08-17 |author=Parker, Same |date=2003-04-23 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> Other more difficult objectives such as [[Raid (gaming)|raids]] are designed to require the cooperation of large groups of players to complete. These often involve completing an objective based on past experience, or by involving enough players to succeed by brute force. Members of an organization that own a city plot may also initiate on-demand raids inside their city. The difficulty of these raids is determined dynamically by the game based on the players who initiate it.<ref name=about_ai_rev/> Missions, as well as some raids and other content, are "instanced" meaning that once a group initiates the content, no other players may interrupt them.

Fighting between players is allowed by requesting a duel, or by entering areas where fighting is allowed. "Land Control Areas" are one example of this type of area found throughout the game. Organizations that acquire the land can build "towers" on it which give skill bonuses to all members. The number of fields is limited, which encourages groups to fight the incumbent owner for control.<ref>

Each side fights to capture and hold points on a map which increase their score until the winning score is reached.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/wsp/anarchy/frontend.cgi?func=frontend.show&func_id=1068&navID=1003,1005,1053,1068&table=PUBLISH&template=drill |title=Lost Eden Expansion |accessdate=2008-09-19 |publisher=[[Funcom]]}}</ref> The ''Lost Eden'' expansion pack, advertised to enhance combat between players, provides several [[mecha|mechs]] and other heavy weapons that can be piloted. These vehicles are allowed in most areas, although they are specifically designed for combat on land control areas and the battle-stations.<ref name=le_stuff/>  ''Anarchy Online'' enforces a limit on the range on levels in which one player may attack another because of the relatively large difference between abilities at different levels.

Day-to-day administration of the game is performed by paid employees know as [[Game master|Game Masters]]. This staff is supplemented by an official group of volunteer players named Advisors of Rubi-Ka (ARK). Advisors help administrators answer problem reports in-game, provide new player orientation, and help coordinate both official and player-run events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ark.funcom.com/Public/ARKsite?page_id=16 |title=Advisors of Rubi-Ka |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |date=2007 }}</ref>

==Story==
[[Image:Anarchy1boxart 160w.jpg|thumb|right|120px|''The Notum Wars'' retail box depicting a battle between Omni-Tek and the Clans]]

''Anarchy Online''{{'}}s plot revolves around the fight to control the fictional planet Rubi-Ka. Its original four year storyline was written and later directed by Ragnar T<U+00F8>rnquist, who also developed the stories for Funcom's ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' and ''[[Dreamfall]]'' titles. It was designed to be played out as a series of in-game events lasting from 2001 until 2005.<ref>{{cite web | author=Park, Andrew |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/anarchy-online-pc/4505-9696_7-30977189.html |title=Anarchy Online (PC) Review |accessdate=2008-08-16 |work= |publisher=[[CNet]] |date=07/13/2001  }}</ref>

According to a description on the game's official website, [[megacorp|hyper-corporation]] Omni-Tek was granted a one thousand year lease to the desert planet on Jan 01, 28708 shorty after its discovery. It was a seemingly useless arid landscape far from civilization until the discovery of the mineral notum. That mineral's properties led to major leaps forward in [[nanotechnology]] that made possible the large-scale manipulation of matter, energy, and even resurrection from death. The first five hundred years of Omni-Tek's unfettered control of Rubi-Ka were marked with an exemplary worker treatment record, but as time passed the company's policies degraded into near [[totalitarianism]]. It was then that a significant number of poorly treated colonists rebelled and began to trade stolen notum to a rival corporation. These rebel groups, collectively calling themselves the Clans, fought a series of wars with Omni-Tek in the centuries leading up to the in-game timeline.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anarchy Online: The Story So Far |publisher=[[Funcom]] |date=2008 |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/wsp/anarchy/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&template=content&func_id=2431&sort=RELDATE%20desc&table=CONTENT |accessdate=2008-08-16 }}</ref>

After the game's release, T<U+00F8>rnquist published his short fiction novel ''Prophet Without Honor (Anarchy Online Book 1)'' that serves as a historical primer.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ragnar T<U+00F8>rnquist |title=Prophet Without Honour (Anarchy Online Book One) |publisher=[[Funcom]]  |date=2001-01-01 |url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/8299596106/ejelta5-20 | accessdate=2008-08-16 }}</ref> The story has since been extended beyond its original conclusion, but a second book was never written.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Terri Perkins from FunCom |publisher=[[IGDA|International Game Developer's Association]] |date=2004-11-01 |work=IGDA Online Games Quarterly |url=http://www.igda.org/online/quarterly/1_1/interview1.php |accessdate=2008-08-16 }}</ref> 

[[roleplay|Role-players]] often participated in and influenced the outcome of the story during the first four years. This is evidenced in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, published in 2003, about a well-known player named Rick Stenlund. Stenlund used the game's [[message board]]s to organize an in-game rally in protest of a proposed change to gameplay. Administrators responded by preparing a role-play event with official characters and incorporating the rally into the official timeline.<ref>{{cite web |author=Schiesel, Seth |title=Voyage to a Strange Planet |date=2003-06-12 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05EFDF1E39F931A25755C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 |accessdate=2008-08-16 | pages=(3) }}</ref>

==Development==
Development for ''Anarchy Online'' started as early as 1995 at Funcom's [[Oslo|Oslo, Norway]] studios.<ref name=7year>{{cite web |title=Funcom Celebrates 7 Years of Anarchy Online |date=2008-06-01 |work=Official Press Release | publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS138988+01-Jul-2008+BW20080701 |accessdate=2008-08-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.funcom.com/wsp/funcom/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&func_id=1007&table=PUBLISH&item=1007 |title=Funcom Press Contact |date=2008|accessdate=2008-08-19 |publisher=[[Funcom]]}}</ref> The company at that time had not yet released its first major title ''The Longest Journey''. In a 2007 interview, former project lead Gaute Godager said that Funcom's management wanted to put substantial resources into a game for the MMORPG market, which they believed would expand in the coming years. He stated that he and many other developers saw the idea as "crazy," and described the project as "ambitious" in most facets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchy-online.com/wsp/anarchy/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&template=content&func_id=2434&table=CONTENT |title='7 Years Online' Video |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=[[Funcom]] |date=2008 }}</ref> Most online role playing games at that time including the two most successful, ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[EverQuest]]'', were based on a more common role playing fantasy theme.<ref name=scifi_theme>{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/073/073266p1.html |title=Anarchy Online Interview |accessdate=2008-08-19 |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=1999-12-15 }}</ref> Funcom made the official announcement of a new science-fiction themed game in 2000.

''Anarchy Online''{{'}}s servers officially opened on June 27, 2001 after a public [[Beta test#Beta|beta test]] that lasted several weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/anarchyonline/news.html?sid=2771960 |title=Anarchy Online beta update |accessdate=2008-08-16 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2001-06-08 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> In its first month online the game was effected by many stability, registration, and billing issues. Customers said that they were unable to register using [[product key]]s provided with the installation discs. Others were accidentally billed the registration fee twice, although they were never charged for the second bill. Players were unable to access large portions of the game's content once logged in, as servers were routinely out of service. Funcom later announced that no customers would be billed for play time until the issues were resolved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/anarchyonline/news.html?sid=2782099 |title=Anarchy Online launch woes |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2001-05-01 }}</ref> Most problems were fixed by the end of the month, and by the second quarter of 2002 the number of subscription began to rise again, reportedly reaching 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/237/Anarchy_Online_Turns_One.html |title=Anarchy Online Turns One |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2002-06-28 |publisher=GameWorld Network}}</ref> 

''Anarchy Online'' has gone on to become on of the longest-running MMORPGs on the market despite its early troubles.<ref name=about_ai_rev>{{cite web |url=http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/alieninvasion.htm |title=Anarchy Online: Alien Invasion Review |accessdate=2008-09-20 |publisher=[[About.com]] | pages=1 | author=Spohn, Dave}}</ref> As the market grows, it has been recognized as a standard setting game because of its visual complexity at the time, depth of gameplay, size of the game world, and customer service among other things.<ref name=le_stuff/><ref name=about_ai_rev/> Four expansions have since been published that customers can buy to extend the original game: ''The Notum Wars'' (2002), ''Shadowlands'' (2003), ''Alien Invasion'' (2004), and ''Lost Eden'' (2006).

''Anarchy Online''{{'}}s  unique proposed features such as the science fiction setting, large playable area, and dynamic missions created significant interest leading up to the release date. The game was one month away from launching when it made its second appearance at the [[E3|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in 2001, and several video game websites such as [[GameSpot]] had written articles about the game's development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/anarchyonline/news.html?sid=2762459 | author=Park, Andrew Seyoon |title=E3 2001 Hands-On Anarchy Online |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2001-04-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2565399.html?print=1 | author=Ajami, Amer|title=Anarchy at E3 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2000-04-12 }}</ref> At the [[European Computer Trade Show]] that same year it was awarded ''Multiplayer Game of Show''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/098/098017p1.html |title=ECTS 2001: Awards |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2002-09-04 }}</ref>

The game's launch problems had a strong negative effect with initial critics. Many larger video game websites, such as Gamespy, chose to wait a month or more before publishing a formal review, and the release is often briefly mentioned in later reviews of the game as a juxtaposition.<ref name=rev_ign_sl/><ref name=yahoo_launchprob>{{cite web |url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/pc/reviews/anarchy-online--the-notum-wars-716b0c.html |title=Anarchy Online: The Notum Wars|accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=[[Yahoo|Yahoo!

''Anarchy Online'''s four published expansion packs were reviewed favorably, although not without some criticisms. The ''Shadowlands'' expansion was the most critically acclaimed by far, winning several ''Editor's Choice'' Awards from [[IGN]], [[CNet]], GameSpot, GameSpy and others after its release in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/10_24_03_08_45AM.htm |title=Free 7 Day Trial of Anarchy Online now includes access to Shadowlands |accessdate=2008-08-17 |date=2003-10-23 |work=Official Press Release |publisher=[[GameZone]]}}</ref> Critics applauded the size and scope of it, such as Andrew Park of GameSpot who called it "absolutely enormous."<ref name=rev_gspot_sl/> Craig Morrison of IGN praised the artistic style of the six new themed areas calling them "visually stunning."<ref name=rev_ign_sl/> Micheal Lafferty of [[GameZone]] wrote that it "has depth in spite of its linear nature."<ref name=rev_gzone_sl>{{cite web | last =Lafferty | first =Michael | title =Anarchy Online Shadowlands| publisher =[[GameZone]] | date =2003-09-09 | url =http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20229.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref> The ''Alien Invasion'' expansion, released in 2004, did not receive the same abundance of praise as its predecessor, although most scores were above 7 out of 10. The new content it introduced, in critic's eyes, was not designed for new players. GameZone wrote, "...this is definitely targeted toward in-game organizations." They went on to say that it "certainly brings new depth to the title."<ref name=rev_gzone_ai>{{cite web | last =Lafferty | first =Michael | title =Anarchy Online Alien Invasion |  publisher =[[GameZone]] | date =2004-10-03 | url =http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r23542.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref> Most popular gaming websites did not review the ''Lost Eden'' expansion released in 2005. The expansion's content itself was well received, but critics pointed to the game's aging interface and visuals compared to newer titles. Sarah Borger of [[Games Radar]] wrote that it "make[s] the world hard to interact with," but she went on to acclaim the new features."<ref name=rev_gradar_le>{{cite web | last =Border | first =Sarah | title =Anarchy Online: Lost Eden | publisher =[[Games Radar]] | date =2005 | url =http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/review/anarchy-online-lost-eden/a-2007011910634944032/p-3 | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref>

==Free Play Program==

''Anarchy Online'' uses a variation of the industry-standard [[Pay to Play]] business model. Customers must buy one month of access to the game for a flat rate, or multiple months at a discounted rate. The subscription model is broken down into three tiers. Users have the option of paying to play all of the game's expansions, paying to play only the Shadowlands expansion, or playing only the original game for free.

Funcom began offering the game's original content including the Notum Wars booster pack for free on December 15, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6115157.html |title=Anarchy Online tries free model |accessdate=2008-08-16 |author=Surette, Time |date=2004-12-15 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050224/245421_1.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050305071225/http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050224/245421_1.html

Images and videos are shown on static billboards placed in high traffic areas of the game. Paying customers have the option to replace these ads with ones for fictitious game-world products. The Free Play Program was originally advertised to last one year, but Funcom has extended the deadline every year since then as of 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.funcom.com/wsp/funcom/frontend.cgi?func=publish.show&func_id=1160&table=CONTENT&item=1004 |title=Funcom extends unique free offer in Anarchy Online to 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2006-10-27 |work=Official Press Release |publisher=[[Funcom]]}}</ref> Former game director "Silirrion" said in a 2008 interview that "it<U+2019>s been a vital part of the success of the game."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aovault.ign.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=89
