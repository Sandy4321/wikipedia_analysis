With [[David Fleay]], [[Kathleen McArthur]] and [[Brian Clouston]], Judith Wright was a founding member and, from 1964 to 1976, President, of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]]. She was the second Australian to receive the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]], in 1991.<ref name="heywood"/>

In "In the Garden",<ref name=capp>[http://www.themonthly.com.au/node/1675 Fiona Capp, "In the Garden"]</ref> Fiona Capp revealed the story of the 25-year secret love affair between two of Australia's most well-known and well-loved public figures, "the famous poet-cum-activist" Judith Wright and "the distinguished yet down-to-earth statesman" [[H. C. Coombs|H. C. "Nugget" Coombs]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/national/secret-love-revealed-the-poet-and-the-former-reserve-bank-chief-20090603-bvqg.html Sydney Morning Herald]</ref>  She had moved to Braidwood in order to be closer to Coombs, who was based in Canberra.

She started to lose her hearing in her mid-20s, and became completely deaf by 1992.<ref name=capp/>

==Poet and critic==
Judith Wright was the author of several collections of poetry, including ''The Moving Image'', ''Woman to Man'', ''The Gateway'', ''The Two Fires'', ''Birds'', ''The Other Half'', ''Magpies'', ''Shadow'', ''Hunting Snake''  and much much more. She was a lover of nature too.

Her work is noted for a keen focus on the Australian environment, which began to gain prominence in Australian art in the years following World War II. She deals with the relationship between settlers, Indigenous Australians and the bush, among other themes. Wright's aesthetic centres on the relationship between mankind and the environment, which she views as the catalyst for poetic creation. Her images characteristically draw from the Australian flora and fauna, yet contain a mythic substrata that probes at the poetic process, limitations of language, and the correspondence between inner existence and objective reality.

Her poems have been translated into [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

===''Birds''===
In 2003, the National Library of [[Australia]] published an expanded edition of Wright's collection titled ''Birds''.<ref name = "McKinney7">McKinney (2004) p.7</ref> Most of these poems were written in the 1950s when she was living on [[Tamborine Mountain]] in southeast [[Queensland]]. McKinney, Wright's daughter, writes that they were written at "a precious and dearly-won time of warmth and bounty to counterbalance at last what felt, in contrast, the chilly dearth and difficulty of her earlier years".<ref name = "McKinney89">McKinney (2004) p.8-9</ref> McKinney goes on to say that "many of these poems have a newly relaxed, almost conversational tone and rhythm, an often humorous ease and an intimacy of voice that surely reflects the new intimacies and joys of her life".<ref name = "McKinney9">McKinney (2004) p.9</ref> Despite the joy reflected in the poems, however, they also acknowledge "the experiences of cruelty, pain and death that are inseparable from the lives of birds as of humans ... and [turn] a sorrowing a clear-sighted gaze on the terrible damage we have done and continue to do to our world, even as we love it".<ref name = "McKinney9"/>

==Environmentalist and social activist==
Wright was well known for her campaigning in support of the conservation of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Fraser Island]]. With some friends, she helped found one of the earliest nature conservation movements.<ref name = "McKinney9"/>

She was also an impassioned advocate for the [[Aboriginal land rights]] movement. [[Thomas Shapcott|Tom Shapcott]], reviewing ''With Love and Fury'', her posthumous collection of selected letters published in 2007, comments that her letter on this topic to the Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] was "almost brutal in its scorn".<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/book-reviews/with-love-and-fury-selected-letters-of-judith-wright/2007/03/09/1173166968695.html Tom Shapcott, Book Review, "With Love and Fury: selected letters of Juhf 284 hey ahey 398rf  dith Wright", ''Sydney Morning Herald, 10 March 2007]</ref> Shortly before her death, she attended a march in [[Canberra]] for reconciliation between non-indigenous Australians and the Aboriginal people.<ref name="litweb.net"/>

Judith Wright died in Canberra on 25 June 2000, aged 85.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms5781 National Library of Australia: Papers of Judith Wright]; Retrieved 5 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2000-06-26%2F0042;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2000-06-26%2F0000%22 House of Representatives, Statements by Members, 26 June 2000]; Retrieved 5 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2F2000-06-27%2F0203;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2000-06-27%2F0000%22 Senate, Adjournment, 27 June 2000]; Retrieved 5 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/gehall/Judith.htm  Gerard HALL, Judith Wright (1915-2000): Australian Poet & Prophet, Published in National Outlook (November 2000)]; Retrieved 5 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jun/29/guardianobituaries.books The Guardian, Obituary, 29 June 2000]; Retrieved 5 August 2013</ref>

==Recognition==
In June 2006 the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) announced that the new federal electorate in [[Queensland]] to be created at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] would be named Wright in honour of her life as a "poet and in the areas of arts, conservation and indigenous affairs in Queensland and Australia".<ref>{{Cite web

Under the 2009 redistribution of Queensland, a [[Division of Wright|new seat]] in southeast Queensland was created and named in Wright's honour; it was first contested in [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010]].

The [[Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts]] in Brisbane's [[Fortitude Valley]] is named after her.

On 2 January 2008, it was announced that a future suburb in the district of [[Molonglo Valley]], [[Canberra]] will be named "Wright". There is already a street in the Canberra suburb of [[Franklin, Australian Capital Territory|Franklin]] named after her. Another of the Molonglo Valley suburbs is to be named after Wright's lover, "Nugget" Coombs.<ref>[http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/suburbs-named-in-new-district/419088.aspx Canberra Times, 3 January 2008]</ref>
