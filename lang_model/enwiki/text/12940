'''Emin Xhinovci''' (also spelled '''Gjinovci''', '''Djinovci''' and '''<U+0110>inovci'''; born {{circa|1959}}) is a retired [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) insurgent and restaurant owner from [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] known for his striking resemblance to [[Nazism|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]].

He immigrated to Germany in 1993 and settled in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], where he started an import-export business. In 1997, he returned to Kosovo and later joined the KLA with the intention of helping separate the region from Yugoslavia. During his time as a guerrilla, he gained the reputation of a "fierce fighter" and came to be known by the nickname "Hitler" because of his likeness to the Nazi leader. Following the [[Kosovo War]], he settled in Mitrovica and opened a string of Nazi-themed restaurants which angered some [[NATO]] peacekeepers and were quickly closed. Xhinovci firmly believes that he is Hitler [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and resorted to portraying Hitler full-time in his public life, posing for pictures with locals, peacekeepers and tourists and charging between 20 and 80 [[euros]] per photograph. He is well known throughout Mitrovica, and his five daughters are referred to by locals as "Hitler's children". Xhinovci always carries a copy of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' with him and is frequently paid to attend events such as weddings and funerals. He is the subject of a short documentary film directed by independent filmmaker Alban Muja, titled ''Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me''.

==Early life, emigration and guerrilla activity==
A [[Kosovo Albanian]], Emin Xhinovci was born in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Kosovska Mitrovica]] in 1959, in what was then [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1993, he moved to the German city of [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], where he started an import-export business. He left Germany in 1997 and returned to Kosovo to "fight for the motherland" as tensions between [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]] increased.<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|author=Chris Bird|title=Hate-filled town where Hitler gets a laugh|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/oct/13/balkans|date=13 October 1999|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref>

Xhinovci joined the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] ({{lang-sq|Ushtria <U+00C7>lirimtare e Kosov<U+00EB>s}}; or KLA) in 1998, and fought against the Serb-dominated [[Army of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] ({{lang-sr|''Vojska Jugoslavije''}}; VJ) with the goal of separating Kosovo from the rest of Yugoslavia.<ref name="Mondro.rs">{{cite news|publisher=Mondo.rs|title=Upoznajte Adolfa Hitlera sa Kosova|trans_title=Meet Adolf Hitler From Kosovo|language=Serbian|url=http://mondo.rs/a756268/Info/Drustvo/Emin-Djinovci-slika-i-prilika-Adolfa-Hitlera.html|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> Xhinovci earned the reputation of a "fierce fighter" and commanded the respect of local Albanians.<ref name="The Guardian"/> His comrades gave him the nickname "Hitler" due to his uncanny resemblance to [[Nazism|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="Hajdari">{{cite news|publisher=Vice Serbia|author=Una Hajdari|title=On je sa Kosova, izgleda kao Hitler i od toga dobro <U+017E>ivi|trans_title=He's From Kosovo, Looks Like Hitler and Earns a Living That Way|language=Serbian|url=http://www.vice.com/rs/read/ta-se-sve-moe-na-kosovu-hitler-u-najam|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> Serbian police documents from 1998 indicate that he was suspected of participating in the [[Battle of Bela<U+0107>evac Mine|kidnapping and execution of nine Serb mineworkers]] at the [[Bela<U+0107>evac coal mine]], near [[Obili<U+0107>]].<ref name="RTS">{{cite news|publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia]]|title=Kosovo, Hitler i karabinjeri|trans_title=Kosovo, Hitler and the Carabinieri|language=Serbian|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/135/Hronika/1783845/Kosovo%2C++Hitler+i+karabinjeri.html|date=26 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref> In 1999, Xhinovci was wounded in battle and was airlifted to Germany for treatment. While in hospital, he grew a [[toothbrush moustache]] which attracted the attention of hospital staff.<ref name="Hajdari"/>
==Controversy==

===Nazi-themed restaurants and bars===
[[File:Hitler, recoloured.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Adolf Hitler]]]]
Following his experience with the German hospital staff, Xhinovci realized that he could capitalize on his resemblance to Hitler.<ref name="Hajdari"/> He went to great lengths to enhance his physical likeness to the Nazi leader<U+2014>regularly clipping his moustache, dying his hair jet black and imitating Hitler's signature hairstyle. When the war in Kosovo ended, Xhinovci returned to Mitrovica and opened a bar called ''Bar Hit and Jet'', known affectionately among Kosovo Albanians as ''Pizzeria Hitleri'' ("Hitler's Pizzeria"). The establishment proved controversial among western peacekeepers who had occupied Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces in June 1999. In one instance, French [[NATO]] troops took down a sign carrying a [[swastika]] from the entrance to Xhinovci's bar, much to his displeasure. One French commander told reporters that he was disgusted with Xhinovci's actions and said that his troops were forbidden from entering the bar, which juxtaposed Nazi imagery with portraits of Xhinovci in KLA uniform. Asked why he enjoyed dressing up as Hitler, Xhinovci responded: "Everyone who is against the people who carried out bloodshed against my people is a friend of mine", apparently referring to the German-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupaton of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], when German forces turned a blind eye to Albanian raids on Serb-populated areas of Kosovo. He conceded that Hitler had gone "too far" by killing women and children, but said that it would be "a good idea to eliminate all those who thirst for our blood".<ref name="The Guardian"/>

Within several years, Xhinovci was forced to close ''Pizzeria Hitleri'' because local KLA commanders felt that it would tarnish the organization's image.<ref name="RTS"/> Like many in post-war Kosovo, he encountered great financial difficulties and relied on his KLA service [[pension]] and financial assistance from relatives in [[Western Europe]]. Once his financial situation stabilized, Xhinovci opened a restaurant and named it ''Jehona'' after his oldest daughter. All of the restaurant's receipts were stamped with a black swastika in the upper left corner. The restaurant closed a few years after its opening for reasons unknown.<ref name="Hajdari"/>

===Hitler impersonator===

With his restaurants and bars closed at every turn, Xhinovci has resorted to walking around Mitrovica dressed as Hitler and posing for pictures with locals, tourists and NATO peacekeepers, charging between 20 and 80 [[euros]] per photograph. Some days, he earns as many as 200 euros posing as Hitler. Besides posing for photographs, Xhinovci attends various events, including weddings and funerals, and greets attendees with a [[Nazi salute]]. "[This] sometimes has an undesirable effect because people who've come to pay their respects to the deceased often wish to speak with me and take pictures," Xhinovci explains.<ref name="Hajdari"/>

Xhinovci firmly believes that he is Hitler [[reincarnation|reincarnated]].<ref name="IB Times">{{cite news|publisher=International Business Times|author=Samantha Payne|title=Kosovan man thinks he's Nazi leader Adolf Hitler reincarnated and takes Mein Kampf everywhere|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/kosovan-man-thinks-hes-nazi-leader-adolf-hitler-reincarnated-takes-mein-kempf-everywhere-1480925|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era [[Reichsmark]]s, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, and a copy of ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word "Hitler" printed in bold and, like Hitler, he does not smoke. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby<U+2014>including some NATO peacekeepers<U+2014>stop and greet him with the Nazi salute.<ref name="Hajdari"/> Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living "shows great enterprise".<ref name="Jutarnji.hr">{{cite news|publisher=Jutarnji list|author=<U+017D>eljko Trkanjec|title=Hitler iz Kosovske Mitrovice: F<U+00FC>hrerova reinkarnacija napla<U+0107>uje 100 eura za svoju fotografiju|trans_title=Hitler From Kosovska Mitrovica: F<U+00FC>hrer Reincarnated Charges 100 Euros Per Photograph|language=Croatian|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/hitler-iz-kosovske-mitrovice-f-hrerova-reinkarnacija-naplacuje-100-eura-za-svoju-fotografiju/1262924/|date=26 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref> "People respect me," Xhinovci explains. "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with "Heil Hitler!". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations.<ref name="Hajdari"/> Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures.<ref name="Mondro.rs"/> "Girls like to touch my face; they think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask for permission to kiss my cheeks. When I go out of the house with my wife and kids, people stop to talk to me. Thankfully, my wife isn't jealous."<ref name="Hajdari"/>

Xhinovci is unable to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|laws]] which prohibit Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting.<ref name="Jutarnji.hr"/> He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says that he would have to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the [[Northern Kosovska Mitrovica|Serb-held section of Mitrovica]].<ref name="Hajdari"/> When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: "It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against [the Serbs]. The enemy of my enemy if my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies."<ref name="IB Times"/> He explained: "I am not a dictator like [Hitler], but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him."<ref name="Hajdari"/>

==In popular culture==
In 2013, Kosovar filmmaker Alban Muja created a short documentary film about Xhinovci titled ''Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me'', which chronicles Xhinovci's everyday activities and follows him around Mitrovica as he interacts with locals.<ref name="Hajdari"/>
