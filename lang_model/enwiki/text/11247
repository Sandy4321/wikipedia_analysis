PFC '''Carmen Garcia  Rosado''' (born October 29, 1926) is an educator, author and activist for the rights of women veterans who was among the first 200 Puerto Rican women to be recruited into the [[WAC]]'s during [[World War II]]. Her book "LAS WACS-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Segunda Guerra Mundial" (The WACs-The participation of the Puerto Rican women in the Second World War), is the first book to document the experiences of the first 200 Puerto Rican women who participated in said conflict as members of the armed forces of the United States.  
==Early years==
Garcia Rosado was the seventh of nine siblings born in [[Humacao, Puerto Rico]] to Jesus Garcia Doble and Maria Rosado Arce de Garcia. Her father was the foremen of a sugar plantation who would often be assigned to work in [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. His family traveled with him and therefore Garcia Rosado was raised and received her primary and secondary education in various countries. In 1944, at the age of 18, she earned her teachers diploma from the [[University of Puerto Rico]] and worked in her profession in the mountainous areas between the towns of [[Las Piedras, Puerto Rico|Las Piedras]] and [[Humacao]]. On September 17, 1944, "[[El Mundo]]", a local newspaper, announced that the United States were seeking women volunteers for the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAC's).<ref name="WR">Hispanic link weekly report, Volume 6, Page 122</ref>

==World War II==
By this time the [[United States]] had entered [[World War II]] and therefore needed to boost its military capabilities; as a result, the Army ordered Puerto Rico's [[65th Infantry|65th Infantry Regiment]] to full war strength and drafted many Puerto Ricans &mdash; even those whose knowledge of [[English language|English]] was minimal.  As a result the Army recognized the need for bilingual personnel to fill in the  clerical positions left empty by the male soldiers who were sent to the front lines. In 1944, the Army sent three WAC (Women's Army Corps) recruiters to the island to organize a unit of 200 WACs. Over 1,500 women responded to the call and applied, however only 200 were selected, among them, against her parents wishes, was Garcia Rosado.<ref>[http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/HisHistory.html The Contributions of Hispanic Servicewomen--Written by: Judith Bellafaire, Ph.D., Curator]</ref>

After being sworn in during the ceremonies held in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], Garcia Rosado  and the other 199 women were sent to [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]] for their basic training. The women were tested for their abilities and were given further training. Their duties varied, some were assigned as dental assistents, others as clerks and so on. Garcia Rosado was assigned to the position of dental assistant. The women were assigned to Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, a segregated Hispanic unit, and upon the completion of their training were sent to the Port of Embarkation of [[New York City]].<ref name="PR Women">[http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/PRHistory.html Puerto Rican Woman in Defense of our country]</ref>

==Post World War II==

The American participation in the Second World War came to an end in Europe on May 8, 1945 when the western Allies celebrated "[[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]]" (Victory in Europe Day) upon Germany's surrender, and in the Asian theater on August 14, 1945 "[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]" (Victory over Japan Day) when the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] by signing the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]]. The women of Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps returned to Puerto Rico on January 6, 1946, where Garcia Rosado and the others were Honorably Discharged from the military. After the war, Garcia Rosado, like so many other women in the military, returned to civilian life.<ref name="WR"/>

From 1946 to 1948, Garcia Rosado continued in her profession as a teacher, during which time she earned her Bachelors of Arts degree from the [[Interamerican University]], then known as the Polytechnic Institute at [[San German, Puerto Rico]]. She traveled through various states of the United States to work on her tesis "Career Education" and worked on her post graduate Doctorate in supervision and administration in education.<ref name="AP">Latinamerica press, Volume 21, Page 22, Publisher: Noticias Aliadas (1969), ASIN: B0000EDML0</ref>

Mendez]]'s Puerto Rico Institute Jr. College and later as the Resident Director of the Se<U+00F1>oritas de la Universidad del Sagrado Corazon". In 1989, she was named consultant to the Director of Veterans Affairs in Puerto Rico. In her position she became an activist and worked for the rights of the Puerto Rican women veteran.
