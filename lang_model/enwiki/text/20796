'''SMS ''Braunschweig''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''[[Braunschweig]]''") was the first of five [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s of the [[Braunschweig class battleship|''Braunschweig'' class]] in the German [[Kaiserliche Marine]] (Imperial Navy). She was laid down in 1901 and commissioned in October 1904, at a cost of 23,983,000 [[German gold mark|marks]]. She was named after the then [[Duchy of Brunswick|duchy of Braunschweig]]. Her sister ships were {{SMS|Elsass||2}}, {{SMS|Hessen||2}}, {{SMS|Preussen|1903|2}}, and {{SMS|Lothringen||2}}.

The ship served in the II Squadron of the German fleet after commissioning, though by the outbreak of World War I she had been moved to the IV Squadron. ''Braunschweig'' saw action in the Baltic Sea against the [[Russian Navy]]. In August 1915, the ship participated in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]], during which she engaged the Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']]. In 1916, the ship was placed in reserve owing to crew shortages. She spent the remainder of World War I as a training ship, and after 1917, as a barracks ship for [[U-boat]] crews. 

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921&ndash;22. ''Braunschweig'' served in the reformed [[Reichsmarine]] as a coastal defense ship until 1926, when she was again placed in reserve. She was stricken in 1931 and subsequently [[Ship breaking|broken up for scrap]].

==Construction==
{{main|Braunschweig class battleship}}
''Braunschweig'' was laid down in 1901, at the [[Germaniawerft]] in [[Kiel]] under construction number 97. The first of her class, she was ordered under the contract name "H" as a new unit for the fleet. The ship cost 23,983,000 [[German gold mark|marks]].<ref name=G18>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 18</ref> ''Braunschweig'' was launched on 20 December 1902 and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1904.<ref name=G20>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 20</ref>

The ship was {{convert|127.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. ''Braunschweig''{{'}}s powerplant was rated at {{convert|16000|ihp|lk=on}}, which generated a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=G18/>

''Braunschweig''{{'}}s armament consisted of a main battery of four 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) SK L/40 guns in twin [[gun turret]]s,<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (''Schnellfeuerkanone'') denotes that the gun quick firing, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 [[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 40 as times long as it is in diameter. See: Grie<U+00DF>mer, p. 177</ref> one fore and one aft of the central [[superstructure]].<ref name=H68>Hore, p. 68</ref> Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17&nbsp;cm (6.7&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns and eighteen 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes, all mounted submerged in the hull.<ref name=G20/>

==Service history==
Upon commissioning in October 1904, ''Braunschweig'' was assigned to the II Division of the II Squadron of the German fleet. She was joined by her sister {{SMS|Elsass||2}} the following month; the II Division was rounded out by the old battleship {{SMS|Weissenburg||2}}. The German Navy in 1905 consisted of four divisions of three battleships each, with two divisions per squadron. This was supported by a cruiser division, composed of two [[armored cruiser]]s and six [[protected cruiser]]s.<ref>''The British and German Fleets'', p. 335</ref><ref name=G20/>

After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, ''Braunschweig'' was assigned to the IV Battle Squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet]].<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 141</ref> The squadron was commanded by Vice Admiral [[Ehrhard Schmidt]].<ref>Scheer, p. 15</ref> In July 1915, following the loss of the [[Minelayer|minelaying]] cruiser {{SMS|Albatross||2}} in the Baltic, the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area.<ref>Halpern, p. 195</ref> On 11 and 19 July, German cruisers, with the IV Squadron ships in support, conducted sweeps in the Baltic, though without engaging Russian forces.<ref name=H196>Halpern, p. 196</ref>

In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the [[Gulf of Riga]] of Russian naval forces, in order to aid the German Army advancing on the city. The IV Squadron was joined by the I Squadron, which consisted of the eight {{sclass|Nassau|battleship|5}} and {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|6}}s, from the High Seas Fleet, along with three [[battlecruiser]]s and a host of smaller craft. The task force was placed under command of Vice Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]], though operational command remained with Vice Admiral Schmidt.<ref name=H196/> On the morning of 8 August, the Germans made their initial push into the Gulf; ''Braunschweig'' and ''Elsass'' were tasked with engaging the Russian pre-dreadnought [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and preventing her from disrupting the German minesweepers. However, when it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall, Schmidt called off the attempt.<ref>Halpern, pp. 196&ndash;197</ref> A second attempt was made on 16 August; this time, ''Braunschweig'' remained outside the Gulf while the [[dreadnought]]s {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Posen||2}} took over the task of dealing with ''Slava''.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area, however, prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day.<ref>Halpern, pp. 197&ndash;198</ref>

On 12 October, the British submarine {{HMS|E18||2}} fired a single torpedo at ''Braunschweig'', though it failed to hit its target.<ref>Polmar & Noot, p. 44&ndash;45</ref> Due to manpower shortages, the IV Squadron ships were demobilized. In 1916, ''Braunschweig'' became a training ship. On 20 August 1917, she was transferred for use as a barracks ship stationed in Kiel.<ref name=G20/> In this role, the ship supported the III Submarine Flotilla.<ref>Gibson & Prendergast, p. 329</ref>

The [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the "''Deutschland'' or ''Lothringen'' types."<ref>See: [[s:Treaty_of_Versailles_1919|Treaty of Versailles]] Section II: Naval Clauses, Article 181</ref> ''Braunschweig'' was chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed [[Reichsmarine]].<ref name=G20/> The ship was modernized at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|Kriegsmarinewerft]] in Wilhelmshaven from 1921&ndash;22.<ref name=G18/> In 1923, ''Braunschweig''{{'}}s bridge was rebuilt and enlarged.<ref name=G20/> She and ''Elsass'', along with the {{sclass|Deutschland|battleship|6}} {{SMS|Schlesien||2}}, were assigned to the North Sea Station.<ref>Chisholm, p. 258</ref> The ship served with the fleet until 1926, when she was withdrawn from active duty and placed in reserve. On 31 March 1931, ''Braunschweig'' was stricken from the naval register and temporarily used as a [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]] in Wilhelmshaven before being broken up for scrap.<ref name=G20/>
