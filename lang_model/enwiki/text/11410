The [[United States Department of State|United States]] has maintained diplomatic ties to [[Equatorial Guinea]] since independence in 1968.  Until 1981, US ambassadors served as the contacts to other African countries simultaneously rather than have a separate person just for Equatorial Guinea.

==History==
In the 19th century, the area of [[Central Africa]] that now contains the nation of [[Equatorial Guinea]] was under [[Spain|Spanish]] control. The area was known as [[Spanish Guinea]] and included the small mainland area of [[R<U+00ED>o Muni]] and the island of Fern<U+00E3>o do P<U+00F3> (or Fernando P<U+00F3>), now named [[Bioko]]. Rio Muni became a Spanish [[protectorate]] in 1885 and a [[colony]] in 1900. In 1926 the island of Bioko and the mainland area of R<U+00ED>o Muni were united as the colony of Spanish Guinea.

In 1959, the Spanish territory of the Gulf of Guinea was established as a [[Provinces of Spain|province of Spain]] known as the Spanish Equatorial Region. Local elections were held and representatives elected to the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' (Spanish parliament).

In 1963 limited autonomy was granted to Spanish Guinea and the people were able to elect members to its own legislature.

In March 1968, under pressure from Equatorial Guinean nationalists and the [[United Nations]], Spain announced that it would grant independence to Equatorial Guinea. A constitutional convention produced an electoral law and draft constitution. In the presence of a UN observer team, a referendum was held on August 11, 1968, and a new constitution was approved. In September 1968, the first president was elected, and independence was granted in October.

The United States immediately [[Diplomatic recognition|recognized]] Equatorial Guinea and moved to establish diplomatic relations. [[Albert W. Sherer, Jr.]], the ambassador to [[Togo]], was additionally accredited as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Equatorial Guinea on October 28, 1968 and presented his credentials to the president on November 21. Sherer remained resident at [[Lom<U+00E9>]], Togo.

An embassy in Santa Isabel (now [[Malabo]]) was opened August 1, 1969, with Albert N. Williams as [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]] ''[[ad interim]]''.

In December 1969 the ambassador to [[Cameroon]] was accredited to Equatorial Guinea while resident in [[Yaound<U+00E9>]], Cameroon.

The embassy in Malabo was closed in 1995 and its functions were transferred to the embassy in Cameroon. The embassy was reopened in 2004.
