The '''Battle off Samar''' was the final stage of the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], the [[largest naval battle in history]].  The battle took place in the [[Philippine Sea]] near the [[Samar]] area of [[Leyte Island]] in the [[Philippines]] on [[October 25]], [[1944]] and involved warships from the [[United States Navy|United States (U.S.) Navy]] against warships from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].  The U.S. Navy ships were commanded by [[Thomas Sprague]] and the Japanese Navy ships were under the command of [[Takeo Kurita]].

In the battle, a large force of Japanese battleships, cruisers, and destroyers engaged a force of three U.S. [[escort aircraft carrier]] [[task group]]s.  The U.S. naval forces were taken by surprise because they thought that Kurita's force had retreated the previous day.  The U.S. "heavy" naval forces, under the command of [[William Halsey, Jr.]], had left the area to attack a Japanese carrier force in what was actually a successful [[ruse]] by the Japanese to lure Halsey's heavy forces away from Leyte.  Unprepared to engage in a battle with large-gunned warships, Sprague's escort carriers attempted to escape from the Japanese force while U.S. destroyers, destroyer escorts, and carrier aircraft made repeated attacks on Kurita's ships, with two U.S. destroyers and a destroyer escort as well as one escort carrier being sunk by gunfire from the Japanese ships.  Another U.S. escort carrier was hit and sunk by a [[kamikaze]] aircraft during the battle.  After losing three cruisers sunk to air attack and suffering damage to several other ships, Kurita withdrew from the battle area, ending the threat to Sprague's carrier force.

The battle was one of the last major naval engagements between U.S. and Japanese naval forces in World War II and significantly contributed to the almost complete destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy by the end of the war.

==Background==
The overall [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] strategy at Leyte Gulf, a plan known as ''Sh<U+014D>-Go 1'' called for [[Vice Admiral|Vice-Admiral]] [[Jisaburo Ozawa]]'s fleet, known as Northern Force, to lure the [[United States]] [[United States 3rd Fleet|Third Fleet]] &mdash; under Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr]] &mdash; away from the Allied [[Battle of Leyte|landings on Leyte]], using an apparently vulnerable force of carriers. The Allied [[landing forces]], now lacking air cover, would then be attacked from the west by Japanese forces including Vice-Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s command, Center Force, which was based in [[Brunei]]. The plan called for Kurita to then enter [[Leyte Gulf]] and attack the Allied landing forces. Kurita's force included the super-[[battleships]] [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] and [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], the largest battleships ever built.

In the lead-up to the battle, on the night of [[23 October]], two American [[submarine]]s, [[USS Dace (SS-247)|''Dace'']] and  [[USS Darter (SS-227)|''Darter'']], spotted Kurita's Center Force entering the Palawan Passage. The two subs submerged and fired [[torpedo]]s, sinking two cruisers and crippling a third. One of the sinking cruisers was the [[flagship]] of Center Force. Admiral Kurita had to swim for his life. Center Force was in chaos for hours, before Kurita was finally rescued. Kurita transferred his flag to ''Yamato''. The order was then given to continue on to Leyte Gulf. 

Kurita's force entered the [[Sibuyan Sea]], northwest of Leyte, on [[24 October]]. In the [[Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#Battle_of_the_Sibuyan_Sea|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], it was attacked by carrier aircraft and ''Musashi'' was sunk. When Kurita turned around, the American pilots thought he was retreating, but he turned again and made his way through the [[San Bernardino Strait]] in the night.

==The forces==
The Japanese Center Force now consisted of ''Yamato'', the battleships [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']], [[Japanese battleship Kong<U+014D>|''Kong<U+014D>'']], and [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']],; the cruisers [[Japanese cruiser Maya|''Maya'']], [[Japanese cruiser Ch<U+014D>kai|''Ch<U+014D>kai'']], [[Japanese cruiser My<U+014D>k<U+014D>|''My<U+014D>k<U+014D>'']], [[Japanese cruiser Haguro|''Haguro'']], [[Japanese cruiser Noshiro|''Noshiro'']], [[Japanese cruiser Kumano|''Kumano'']], [[Japanese cruiser Suzuya|''Suzuya'']], [[Japanese cruiser Chikuma|''Chikuma'']], [[Japanese cruiser Tone|''Tone'']], and [[Japanese cruiser Yahagi|''Yahagi'']], and; 13 destroyers.

To stop them, there were only three groups of light ships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet commanded by Admiral [[Thomas Kinkaid]]. Each had six small [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s, and seven or eight lightly armed and unarmored destroyers and/or smaller destroyer escorts.
Admiral [[Thomas Sprague]]'s Task Unit 77.4.1 ("Taffy 1") consisted of the escort carriers 
[[USS Sangamon (CVE-26)|''Sangamon'']], 
[[USS Suwannee (CVE-27)|''Suwannee'']], 
[[USS Santee (CVE-29)|''Santee'']], and
[[USS Petrof Bay (CVE-80)|''Petrof Bay'']]. (The remaining two escort carriers from Taffy 1, [[USS Chenango (CVE-28)|''Chenango'']] and [[USS Saginaw Bay (CVE-82)|''Saginaw Bay'']], had departed for [[Morotai]], [[Indonesia]] on [[October 24]], carrying "dud" aircraft from other carriers for transfer ashore. They returned with replacement aircraft after the battle.)
Admiral [[Felix Stump]]'s Task Unit 77.4.2 ("Taffy 2") consisted of 
[[USS Natoma Bay (CVE-62)|''Natoma Bay'']], 
[[USS Manila Bay (CVE-61)|''Manila Bay'']], 
[[USS Marcus Island (CVE-77)|''Marcus Island'']], 
[[USS Kadashan Bay (CVE-76)|''Kadashan Bay'']], 
[[USS Savo Island (CVE-78)|''Savo Island'']], and
[[USS Ommaney Bay (CVE-79)|''Ommaney Bay'']].

Admiral [[Clifton Sprague]]'s Task Unit 77.4.3 ("Taffy 3") consisted of
[[USS Fanshaw Bay (CVE-70)|''Fanshaw Bay'']], 
[[USS St Lo (CVE-63)|''St Lo'']], 
[[USS White Plains (CVE-66)|''White Plains'']], 
[[USS Kalinin Bay (CVE-68)|''Kalinin Bay'']], 
[[USS Kitkun Bay (CVE-71)|''Kitkun Bay'']], and
[[USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73)|''Gambier Bay'']].
Though each escort carrier was relatively small, carrying only 30 planes each, they added up to making available more than 500 planes in all. However, as they were intended to attack against ground forces and submarines, most were armed with machine guns, depth charges and high explosive bombs,  effective against troops, submarines or destroyers, but not against armoured battleships or cruisers. Unlike Halsey's fleet carriers which had been sent to counter the bait of remnants of the Japanese carrier fleet, they lacked both the offensive bombs and torpedos and armour to stand in an encounter with a with a force of battleships.

==The battle==
Kurita's force passed through [[San Bernardino Strait]] at 03:00 on [[25 October]] [[1944]] and steamed south along the coast of [[Samar (island)|Samar]], hoping that Halsey had taken the  bait and most of his fleet away.

A mix-up in communications led Kinkaid to believe that Willis A. Lee's Task Force 34 of battleships was guarding the San Bernardino Strait to the north and that there would be no danger from that direction. Halsey had radioed "am proceeding north with three groups to attack enemy carriers at dawn", which did not cause alarm because Halsey had four carrier groups. Thomas Sprague assumed that Halsey was taking three of his carrier groups to attack and would be leaving one group behind to guard the Strait. But Lee had gone with Halsey (who had, in fact, taken all four of his carrier groups) in pursuit of Ozawa. The Japanese came upon Taffy&nbsp;3 at 06:45, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Kurita, not seeing the silhouettes of the tiny escort carriers in his identification manuals, mistook the escort carriers for fleet carriers and thought that he had the whole of the American Third Fleet under the 18-inch (457&nbsp;mm) guns of his battleships.

When Taffy 3 discovered they were coming under attack, [[Clifton Sprague]] (no relation to Thomas Sprague) directed his Taffy&nbsp;3 carriers to turn to launch their aircraft and flee towards a squall to the east, hoping that bad visibility would reduce the accuracy of Japanese gunfire, and ordered the destroyers to make smoke to mask the retreating carriers, which drew fire from the Japanese ships. The History Channel's 2006 "Dogfights" would call it the naval mismatch of the century where David would send Goliath fleeing for home. The Yamato was the largest and most powerful battleship to ever see combat, she alone displaced as much as all of Taffy 3 put together.

Concerned about the splashes of incoming fire, Captain Evans of the destroyer ''Johnston'' which was the closest to the attackers suddenly took the initiative to order his ship to "flank speed, full left rudder," ordering ''Johnston'' to directly attack the greatly superior oncoming Japanese ships on his own in what would appear to be suicidal mission. The ''Johnson'' was a relatively small and unarmored destroyer, completely unequipped to fight Japanese battleships and cruisers. Designed to fight smaller ships and boats, she was was armed with only five 5-inch guns and multiple anti-aircraft weapons which were ineffective against an armored battleship. Only the ''Johnston''<U+2019>s the 10 Mark-15 torpedoes housed in 2 5-tube launchers could be effective, but only if launched well within range of enemy gunfire.

Weaving to avoid shells, and steering towards splashes, the ''Johnston'' approached the Japanese heavy cruiser ''Kumano'' for a torpedo run. When ''Johnston'' was 10&nbsp;miles (20&nbsp;km) from ''Kumano'', her 5-inch guns rained five-inch shells on ''Kumano''<U+2019>s bridge and deck since the shells would bounce off the enemy ship's hull. ''Johnston'' closed to within torpedo range and fired off a salvo, which blew the bow off the cruiser squadron flagship ''Kumano'', also taking the cruiser ''Suzuya'' out of the fight as she stopped to assist. 

From seven miles away, the battleship ''Kongo'' sent a 14 inch shell through the ''Johnston''<U+2019>s deck and engine room. ''Johnston''<U+2019>s speed was cut in half to only 14 knots and killed electric power to the aft gun turrets. Then three 6-inch shells, possibly from ''Yamato'', struck ''Johnston''<U+2019>s bridge, killing many and wounding Captain Evans in his left hand. The bridge was abandoned and Evans steered the ship from the aft steering column. Evans nursed his ship back towards the fleet, when he suddenly saw the other destroyers attacking as well. Emboldened by the Johnston's attack, Sprague gave the order "small boys attack", sending the rest of Taffy&nbsp;3's destroyers on the assault. Even in her heavily damaged state, damage-control teams restored power to 2 of the 3 aft turrets, and Evans turned the ''Johnston'' around and reentered the fight.

The other destroyers attacked the Japanese line with suicidal determination, drawing fire and scattering the Japanese formations as ships turned to avoid torpedoes. The powerful''Yamato'' found herself between two torpedoes fired from the destroyer ''Heerman'' which were on parallel courses, and for ten minutes, she headed away from the action, unable to turn back for fear of being hit. ''Heerman'', meanwhile, went toe-to-toe with the other Japanese battleships, advancing so close to her huge targets that they could not fire for either inability to lower their guns enough or fear of hitting their own men and ships.

At 07:35, the even smaller [[destroyer escort]] ''Samuel B. Roberts'' turned and headed toward the battle. On the way, the ''Roberts'' passed by the mangled ''Johnston'' and saw an inspirational sight in the form of Captain Evans standing on the ''Johnston''<U+2019>s stern, his left hand wrapped in a bandage, saluting (with his good hand) the captain of the ''Roberts''. With only 2 5-inch guns, one fore and aft, and just 3 Mark-15 torpedoes, her crew lacked the weapons and training in tactics to take on the much larger attackers. Still, she charged in to attack the heavy cruiser ''Chokai''. With smoke as cover, the ''Roberts'' steamed to within two and a half miles of ''Chokai'', coming under fire of her two forward 8-inch turrets. But ''Roberts'' was so close that the shells passed overhead. Once in torpedo range, ''Roberts'' 3 torpedoes salvo struck the cruiser, and then the ''Roberts'' dueled with the Japanese ships for an hour, firing over 600 5-inch shells, and raking the upper works with 40&nbsp;mm Bofors and 20&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns while maneuvering at close range. At 08:51, the Japanese finally landed two hits, the second which destroyed the aft gun turret. With her remaining 5-inch gun, she set the bridge of the cruiser ''Chikuma'' afire and destroyed the number 3 gun turret, before being pierced again by by three 14 inch shells from the ''Kongo''. With a 40-foot hole in her side, the ''Roberts'' took on water, and at 09:35, the order was given to abandon ship, sinking 30&nbsp;minutes later with 89 of her crew. She would become known as the destroyer escort that fought like a battleship.

Meanwhile, Sprague had ordered all three Taffy groups to launch their planes with whatever they had, even if they were machine guns or depth charges. Even after many aircraft expended their ammo and  ordnance expended, they made dry runs to threaten and distract Japanese warships and their gunners. Instead of rolling over Taffy&nbsp;3, the Americans had turned it into a bloody all-out brawl with their attackers.

The carriers of Taffy 3 turned south and fled through shellfire. The armor-piercing (AP) shells intended for Halsey's battleships flew right through the thin-skinned escort carriers without triggering their fuses. A switch to High Explosive (HE) shells holed, slowed, and sunk the ''Gambier Bay'' at the rear, while most of the others were also damaged.  Their single stern-mounted five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) anti-aircraft guns returned fire, though they were ineffective against surface ships. Yet, the  ''St. Lo'' scored a hit on the magazine of a cruiser, the only known hit inflicted directly by a gun on an aircraft carrier against an opposing surface vessel.

The tide soon turned against Taffy&nbsp;3's destroyers. Two hours into the attack, Captain Evans aboard the ''Johnston'' spotted a line of four destroyers led by the light cruiser ''Yahagi'' making a torpedo attack on the fleeing carriers and moved to intercept. ''Johnston'' poured fire on the attacking group, forcing them to prematurely fire their torpedoes, missing the carriers. Their gunfire then turned to the weaving ''Johnston''. At 09:10 the Japanese scored a direct hit on one of the forward turrets, knocking it out and setting off many 5-inch shells that were stored in the turret, and her engines damaged engines stopped, leaving her dead in the water. Closing in on the sitting target, the ''Johnston'' was hit so many times that one survivor recalled "they couldn't patch holes fast enough to keep her afloat." At 09:45 (2&nbsp;hours and 45&nbsp;minutes into the battle), Captain Evans finally gave the order to abandon ship. The ''Johnston'' finally sank 25&nbsp;minutes later with 186 of her crew. Evans abandoned ship with the crew, and was never seen again. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

Just as it seemed the end was near for the ultimately doomed Taffy 3, and the other two Taffy groups came under fire with their superior speed, Kurita at 09:20 suddenly broke off the fight and turned, giving the order "all ships, my course north, speed 20", retreated north. 

Though many of his ships were not even damaged, the air and destroyer attacks had broken up his formations, and he had lost tactical control. The heavy cruisers ([[Japanese cruiser Ch<U+014D>kai|''Ch<U+014D>kai'']], [[Japanese cruiser Kumano|''Kumano'']], [[Japanese cruiser Chikuma|''Chikuma'']]) had been sunk, and  the ferocity of the determined concentrated sea and air attack had led him to calculate that continuing was not worth further losses. 

Signals from Ozawa had disabused him of the notion that he was attacking the whole of the 3rd Fleet, which meant that the longer he continued to engage, the more likely it was that he would suffer devastating air strikes from Halsey's main attack carriers which were even more threatening than the tiny force of Taffy 3. He retreated north and then west through the San Bernardino Strait. ''Nagato'', ''Haruna'' and ''Kong<U+014D>'' were severely damaged from the torpedoes of Taffy 3's destroyers. Kurita had begun the battle with five battleships. On return to Japan, only ''Yamato'' remained combat-worthy, and she had not even taken a major part in the battle. 

The spirit of Taffy&nbsp;3 was shown when, while watching the Japanese retreat, Sprague heard a nearby sailor exclaim: "damnit boys, they're getting away!"

The American destroyers [[USS Hoel (DD-533)|''Hoel'']] and [[USS Johnston (DD-557)|''Johnston'']], and destroyer escort [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413)|''Samuel B. Roberts'']] were sunk and four others were damaged. The destroyer ''Heerman'', despite her duel with Japanese battleships many times her size, finished the battle with only six of her crew dead. Over a thousand American thousand sailors and pilots gave their lives that day.

Taffy 3 was awarded a [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] "For extraordinary heroism in action against powerful units of the Japanese Fleet during the Battle off Samar, Philippines, October 25, 1944. ...the gallant ships of the Task Unit waged battle fiercely against the superior speed and fire power of the advancing enemy ...two of the Unit's valiant destroyers and one destroyer escort charged the battleships point-blank and, expending their last torpedoes in desperate defense of the entire group, went down under the enemy's heavy shells ... The courageous determination and the superb teamwork of the officers and men who fought the embarked planes and who manned the ships of Task Unit 77.4.3 were instrumental in effecting the retirement of a hostile force threatening our Leyte invasion operations and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."
