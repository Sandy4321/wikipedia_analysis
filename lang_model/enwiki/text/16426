'''Norman Kingsley Mailer''' (born [[January 31]], [[1923]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[novelist]], [[journalist]], [[playwright]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]].  Along with [[Truman Capote]], [[Joan Didion]] and [[Tom Wolfe]], Mailer is considered an innovator of [[creative nonfiction]], a genre sometimes called [[New Journalism]], but which covers the  [[essay]] to the [[nonfiction novel]]. He has been awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] twice and the [[National Book Award]] once. In 2005, he won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from The [[National Book Foundation]].

==Biography==
Mailer was born to a [[Jewish]] family, (mother Fanny Schneider Mailer and father Isaace Barnett Mailer) in [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]], [[New Jersey]]. He was brought up in [[Brooklyn, New York]], graduated from Boys' High School and when he was only sixteen was admitted to [[Harvard University]] in [[1939]], where he studied [[aeronautical engineering]]. At the university, he became interested in writing and published his first story when he was 18. 
Mailer graduated from Harvard in [[1943]] was [[Selective Service System|drafted]] into the [[U.S. Army|Army]] in [[World War II]] and served in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]].  
==Writing life==
===Novels===
In [[1948]], just before enrolling in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]], he published a book that made him world-famous: ''[[The Naked and the Dead]],''  based on his personal experiences during World War II.  It was hailed by many as one of the best American novels to come out of the war years and named one of the "[[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels|100 best novels in English language]]" by the [[Modern Library]].

In the following years, Mailer continued to work in the field of the novel. ''Barbary Shore'' ([[1951]]) was a surreal parable of Cold War left politics, set in a Brooklyn rooming-house. His [[1955]] novel ''The Deer Park'' drew on his experiences working as a screenwriter in Hollywood in the early 1950s. It was initially rejected by six publishers owing to its sexual content. 

===Essays===
In the mid-[[1950s]], he became increasingly known for his counter-cultural essays.  He was one of the founders of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in 1955 [http://www.villagevoice.com/aboutus/].  In the book ''Advertisements for Myself'' ([[1959]]), including the essay ''The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster'' ([[1957]]), Mailer examined violence, hysteria, sex, crime and confusion in American society, in both fictional and reportage forms.  He has also been a frequent contributer of book reviews and long essays to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' since its founding issue in 1963.

===Other===
Other famous works include: ''The Presidential Papers'' ([[1963]]), ''[[An American Dream]]'' ([[1965]]), ''Why Are We in Vietnam?'' (1967), ''[[Armies of the Night]]'' ([[1968]], awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]] and [[National Book Award]]), ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago'' (1968), ''[[Of a Fire on the Moon]]'' ([[1970]]), ''The Prisoner of Sex'' ([[1971]]), ''Marilyn'' ([[1973]]), ''The Fight'' ([[1975]]), ''[[The Executioner's Song]]'' ([[1979]], awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]]), ''Ancient Evenings'' ([[1983]]), ''[[Harlot's Ghost]]'' ([[1991]]), ''[[Oswald's Tale]]'' ([[1995]]), and ''[[The Castle in the Forest]]'' ([[2007]]).

In 1968 he received a [[George Polk Award]] for his reporting in ''Harper's ''Magazine.

In the film Sleeper Woody Allen is shown a picture of Mailer, Allen confirms his identity and states that Mailer donated his ego to the Harvard Medical School.

In addition to his experimental fiction and [[nonfiction novel]]s, Mailer has produced a play version of ''The Deer Park'', and in the late [[1960s]] directed a number of improvisational avant-garde films in a Warhol style, including ''[[Maidstone (film)|Maidstone]]'' (1970), which includes a brutal brawl between [[Norman T. Kingsley]], played by himself, and [[Rip Torn]] that may or may not have been planned. In [[1987]], he directed a film version of his novel ''Tough Guys Don't Dance'', starring [[Ryan O'Neal]], which has become a minor camp classic.

==Activism==
A number of Mailer's nonfiction works, such as The ''[[Armies of the Night]]'' and ''[[The Presidential Papers]]'', are political. He covered the [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[Democratic National Convention]]s in 1960, [[1964]], 1968, [[1972]], [[1992]], and [[1996]]. In 1967, he was arrested for his involvement in [[Vietnam War#Opposition to the war|anti-Vietnam War]] demonstrations. Two years later, he ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic Party primary for [[Mayor of New York City]], allied with columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]] (who ran for City Council President), proposing [[New York City secession]] and creating a [[51st state]].

In [[1980]], Mailer spearheaded convicted killer [[Jack Abbott]]'s successful bid for [[parole]]. He helped Abbott publish a collection of letters to Mailer about his experiences in prison. Abbott committed a murder within weeks of his release, and consequently, Mailer was subject to criticism for his role; in a 1992 interview, in the ''[[Buffalo News]]'', he conceded that his involvement was "another episode in my life in which I can find nothing to cheer about or nothing to take pride in."

==Biographies==
His biographical subjects have included [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. His 1986 [[off-Broadway]] play ''Strawhead'' starring his daughter, Kate, was about [[Marilyn Monroe]]. His 1973 biography of Monroe was particularly controversial: in its final chapter he stated that she was murdered by agents of the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] who resented her supposed affair with [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. He later admitted that these speculations were "not good journalism." 

==Personal life==
Mailer has been married six times, and has eight natural children and one adopted child by his various wives. He married first in [[1944]] to Beatrice Silverman before divorcing her in [[1952]].  In 1960, Mailer stabbed his second wife, [[Adele Morales]] who he married in [[1954]], with a penknife at a party. While Morales made a full physical recovery, in 1997 she published a memoir of their marriage entitled ''[[The Last Party]]'', which outlined her perception of the incident. This incident has been a focal point for feminist critics of Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work. Another of his wives (third)  was the British heiress and journalist [[Lady Jeanne Campbell]] (1929-2007), the only daughter of the 11th [[Duke of Argyll]] and a granddaughter of the press baron [[Lord Beaverbrook]]; by her, he had a daughter, [[Kate Mailer]], who is an actress. His son [[Michael Mailer]] is a film producer. His fourth and longest marriage to date was to model turned actress Beverly Bentley, mother of his producer son Michael and actor son Stephen. His fifth wife was Carol Stevens with whom he had a daughter Maggie Alexander.

In 2005 he co-authored a book with his youngest child, [[John Buffalo Mailer]], titled ''The Big Empty''.  In 2007 [[Random House]] published his latest novel, ''The Castle in the Forest''. 

He currently lives in [[Provincetown, MA]] with his sixth wife Norris Church Mailer.
