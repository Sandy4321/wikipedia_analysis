'''Gabrielle <U+00C9>milie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, marquise du Ch<U+00E2>telet''' ({{IPA-fr|dy <U+0283><U+0251>tl<U+025B>|lang}}; 17 December 1706 &nbsp;<U+2013> 10 September 1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Her crowning achievement is considered to be her  translation and commentary on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]''. The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation.

[[Voltaire]], one of her lovers, declared in a letter to his friend King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick&nbsp;II of Prussia]] that du Ch<U+00E2>telet was "a great man whose only fault was being a woman".<ref name=Bodanis/><ref>Hamel (1910: 370)</ref> She was also romantically linked with two other influential philosophers of the period, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertius]] (1698<U+2013>1759) and Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709<U+2013>1751).<ref>Jonathan I.

===Early life===
<U+00C9>milie du Ch<U+00E2>telet was born on 17 December 1706 in [[Paris]], the only girl amongst six children. Three brothers lived to adulthood: Ren<U+00E9>-Alexandre (b. 1698), Charles-Auguste (b. 1701), and Elisabeth-Th<U+00E9>odore (b. 1710). Her eldest brother, Ren<U+00E9>-Alexandre, died in 1720, and the next brother, Charles-Auguste, died in 1731. However, her younger brother, Elisabeth-Th<U+00E9>odore, lived to a successful old age, becoming an abb<U+00E9> and eventually a bishop. Two other brothers died very young.<ref>Zinsser, pp. 19, 21, 22.</ref> Du Ch<U+00E2>telet also had an illegitimate half-sister, Michelle, who was born of her father and Anne Bellinzani, an intelligent woman who was interested in astronomy and married to an important Parisian official.<ref>Zinsser, pp. 16<U+2013>17; for a quite different account, see Bodanis, pp. 131<U+2013>134.</ref>

Her father was [[Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil]], a member of the lesser nobility. At the time of du Ch<U+00E2>telet's birth, her father held the position of the Principal Secretary and Introducer of Ambassadors to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].   He held a weekly ''salon'' on Thursdays, to which well-respected writers and scientists were invited.

===Early education===
Du Ch<U+00E2>telet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty.<ref name="Zinsser">Zinsser.</ref>

Among their acquaintances was [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the perpetual secretary of the French [[Acad<U+00E9>mie des Sciences]]. <U+00C9>milie's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old.<ref name=Bodanis/> <U+00C9>milie's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women.<ref name=Bodanis/> While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of <U+00C9>milie's intellectual curiosity,<ref name=Bodanis/> there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of du Ch<U+00E2>telet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.<ref name=Zinsser2629>Zinsser (2006: 26<U+2013>29)</ref>

In either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status.  When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as [[fencing]] and [[Equestrianism|riding]], and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her.<ref name=Bodanis/> As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[German language|German]]; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science. Her mother Gabrielle-Anne was horrified at her progress and fought Louis-Nicolas at every step, once attempting to have <U+00C9>milie sent to a convent.<ref name=Zinsser2629/>

<U+00C9>milie also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the [[harpsichord]], sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling.<ref name=Bodanis/>

===Marriage===
On 12 June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont.<ref>Hamel (1910: 5).</ref><ref group=note>The ''Lomont'' suffix indicates the branch of the ''du Chastellet'' family; another such branch was the ''du Chastellet-Clemont''.</ref> Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet.<ref group=note>The spelling ''Ch<U+00E2>telet'' (replacing the ''s'' by a circumflex over the ''a'') was introduced by [[Voltaire]], and has now become standard. ({{cite book|last=Andrew|first=Edward |title=Patrons of enlightenment|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2006|page=101|chapter=Voltaire and his female protectors|isbn=978-0-8020-9064-5}})</ref> Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was [[Arranged marriage|arranged]].  As a wedding gift, the husband was made governor of [[Semur-en-Auxois]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725.  Du Ch<U+00E2>telet was nineteen at the time, her husband thirty-four.

===Children===
The Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet and <U+00C9>milie du Ch<U+00E2>telet had three children: Fran<U+00E7>oise Gabriel Pauline (born 30 June 1726), [[Louis Marie Florent du Ch<U+00E2>telet|Louis Marie Florent]] (born 20 November 1727), and Victor-Esprit (born 11 April 1733).<ref name=Zinsser_pp39_58>Zinsser, pp. 39 and 58.</ref>  Victor-Esprit died as a toddler in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August.<ref name=Zinsser_pp40_93>Zinsser, pp. 40 and 93.</ref> In 1749 <U+00C9>milie du Ch<U+00E2>telet gave birth to Stanislas-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de du Ch<U+00E2>telet (daughter of [[Jean Fran<U+00E7>ois de Saint-Lambert]]). She was born on 4 September 1749. The infant died in [[Lun<U+00E9>ville]] on 6 May 1751.<ref>D. W. Smith, "Nouveaux regards sur la br<U+00E8>ve rencontre entre Mme Du Ch<U+00E2>telet et Saint-Lambert." In The Enterprise of Enlightenment. A Tribute to David Williams from his friends. Ed. Terry Pratt and David McCallam. Oxford, Berne, etc.: Peter Lang, 2004, p. 329-343. See also Anne Soprani, ed., Mme Du Ch<U+00E2>telet, Lettres d'amour au marquis de Saint-Lambert, Paris, 1997.</ref>

===Resumption of studies===
In 1733, at the age of 26, du Ch<U+00E2>telet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by [[Moreau de Maupertuis]], a member of the Academy of Sciences. Although [[mathematics]] was not his forte, Maupertuis had received a solid education from [[Johann Bernoulli]], who also taught [[Leonhard Euler]]. By 1735, however, du Ch<U+00E2>telet had turned for her mathematical training to [[Alexis Clairaut]], a mathematical prodigy known best for [[Clairaut's equation]] and [[Clairaut's theorem]].

===Relationship with Voltaire===
[[Image:Voltaire Philosophy of Newton frontispiece.jpg|thumb|right| In the frontispiece to [[Voltaire]]'s book on Newton's philosophy, du Ch<U+00E2>telet appears as Voltaire's muse, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire.]]

Du Ch<U+00E2>telet and Voltaire may have met in her childhood at one of her father's ''salons''; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship began in earnest in May 1733, upon her re-entering society after the birth of her third child.<ref name="Zinsser"/>

Du Ch<U+00E2>telet invited Voltaire to live in her country house at [[Cirey-sur-Blaise]] in [[Haute-Marne]], northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion (under the eyes of her tolerant husband). There she studied physics and mathematics and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire's letters to friends and their commentaries on each other's work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Newton]]'', where the chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own ''Essai sur l'optique''. But she was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the [[Journal des savants]].<ref>
{{cite web|title=Voltaire|first=J. B.|last=Shank|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/voltaire/}}
</ref>

While sharing a passion for science, they had scientific collaborations. They set up a laboratory in du Ch<U+00E2>telet's home. In healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since <U+00C9>milie disagreed with Voltaire's essay. Though neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published.<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+00C9>milie du Ch<U+00E2>telet|first=Karen |last=Detlefsen|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emilie-du-chatelet/|accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy.<ref>

===Final pregnancy and death===
[[File:ChateauLuneville3.jpg|thumb|right|The chateau of Lun<U+00E9>ville]]

In May 1748, du Ch<U+00E2>telet began an affair with the poet [[Jean Fran<U+00E7>ois de Saint-Lambert]] and became pregnant. In a letter to a friend, she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 3 September 1749, she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, but died a week later, at [[Lun<U+00E9>ville]], from a pulmonary [[embolism]], at the age of 42. Her daughter died roughly eighteen months later.<ref>Zinsser (2006: 278)</ref>

==Scientific research and publications==

===Criticizing Locke and the debate on ''thinking matter''===
In her writings, Emilie du Ch<U+00E2>telet criticizes John Locke<U+2019>s philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: Locke<U+2019>s idea of the possibility of ''thinking matter'' is [<U+2026>] abstruse. Her critique on Locke originates in her Bernard de Mandeville commentary [on the ''Fable of the Bees'']. She confronts us with her resolute statement in favor of universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintains that this kind of law is innate. [<U+2026>] Du Ch<U+00E2>telet claims the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Ch<U+00E2>telet rejects John Locke<U+2019>s aversion of innate ideas and a priori principles. She also reverses Locke<U+2019>s negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the ''Institutions''. On the contrary, she affirms her arguments in favor of the necessity of a priori and universal principles. <U+201C>two and two could then make as well 4 as 6<U+201D> if a priori principles did not exist.

Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis<U+2019> and Julien Offray de La Mettrie<U+2019>s reference to Du Ch<U+00E2>telet's deliberations on motion and free will, on ''thinking matter'' and numbers and on the way to do metaphysics indicate the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, [<U+2026>] and argues against Maupertuis.<ref>Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)</ref>

===Heat and light===
[[File:Sur La Nature et La Propagation du feu 1744.tif|thumb | right | ''Dissertation Sur La Nature et La Propagation du feu'', 1744]]
In 1737, Ch<U+00E2>telet published a paper entitled ''Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu'', based upon her research into the science of fire, that predicted what is today known as [[infrared|infrared radiation]] and the nature of light.

===''Institutions de Physique''===
Her book ''Institutions de Physique'' (<U+201C>Lessons in Physics<U+201D>) appeared in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her thirteen-year-old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time.

===Forces Vives===
[[File:Reponse de Madame Du Chatelet 1741 RGNb10349364.04.tp.tif|thumb | right | ''R<U+00E9>ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet'', 1741]]
In 1741, du Ch&acirc;telet published a small book entitled ''R<U+00E9>ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan''. [[Dortous de Mairan]], secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for ''forces vives''.   Du Ch&acirc;telet presented a spirited point by point rebuttal of de Mairan's arguments, which caused him to withdraw from the controversy.<ref name=4Cent>{{cite book|last=Smeltzer|first=Ronald K.|title=Extraordinary Women in Science & Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement|year=2013|publisher=The Grolier Club}}</ref>

===Advocacy of kinetic energy===
Although in the early 18th century the concepts of force and [[momentum]] had been long understood, the idea of ''energy'' as a transferrable currency between different systems, was still in its infancy and would not be fully resolved until well into the 19th Century. <U+00C9>milie du Ch<U+00E2>telet contributed towards this resolution when, inspired by the theories of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's [[kinetic energy]] - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown conclusively to be proportional to the square of the [[velocity]]. Earlier workers like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Voltaire had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was indistinct from [[momentum]] and therefore proportional to velocity. In [[classical physics]] the correct formula is <math>E_k = \frac12 mv^2</math>, where <math>E_k</math> is the kinetic energy of an object, <math>m</math> its [[mass]] and <math>v</math> its velocity.) Some commentators have perceived this as a precursor to the <math>c^2</math> multiplier in [[Albert Einstein's]] mass-energy formula, and indeed <math>\frac12 mv^2</math> is the first term in the [[binomial expansion]] of the relativistic [[kinetic energy]] expression.

===Translation and commentary on Newton's ''Principia''===
In 1749, the year of her death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton<U+2019>s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', including her derivation of the notion of [[conservation of energy]] from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, today du Ch<U+00E2>telet's translation of ''Principia Mathematica'' is still the standard translation of the work into French.

==Other contributions==

===Development of financial derivatives===
Much later in life, she once lost the huge sum of 84,000 francs<U+2014>some of it borrowed<U+2014>in one evening at the table at the court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats.<ref name=Bodanis>Bodanis.</ref><ref>Hamel (1910: 286)</ref> To quickly raise the money to pay back her debts, she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.<ref name=Bodanis/>

===Biblical scholarship===
Du Ch<U+00E2>telet wrote a critical analysis of the Bible, specifically the book of Genesis and those of the New Testament.

===Discourse on happiness===
Du Ch<U+00E2>telet also wrote a monograph, ''Discours sur le bonheur'', on the nature of happiness, both in general and specialized to women.

===Translation of the ''Fable of the Bees'', and other works===
Du Ch<U+00E2>telet translated ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will.

===Support of women's education===
In her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the ''Fable of the Bees'', du Ch<U+00E2>telet argues strongly for women's education, particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French ''coll<U+00E8>ges''.   By denying women a good education, she argues, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.<ref name=Zinsser_p25>Zinsser, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref>

A [[12059 du Ch<U+00E2>telet|main-belt minor planet]] and a [[List of craters on Venus|crater on Venus]] have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: ''Legacy of Light'' by Karen Zacar<U+00ED>as; ''Emilie: La Marquise Du Ch<U+00E2>telet Defends Her Life Tonight'' by [[Lauren Gunderson]] and ''Urania: the Life of Emilie du Ch<U+00E2>telet'' by Jyl Bonaguro. The opera ''[[<U+00C9>milie (opera)|<U+00C9>milie]]'' of [[Kaija Saariaho]] is about the last moments of her life.<ref>[http://www.opera-lyon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/opera_0910/Emilie/Texte_Emilie.pdf ''Libretto of <U+00C9>milie'']</ref>

Du Ch<U+00E2>telet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (''Femmes c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bres'') introduced a possibly apocryphal story of du Ch<U+00E2>telet's childhood.<ref name=Zinsser_p13>Zinsser, p. 13.</ref>  According to this story, a servant fashioned a doll for her by dressing up wooden [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] as a doll; however, du Ch<U+00E2>telet undressed the dividers and intuiting their purpose, made a circle with them.
