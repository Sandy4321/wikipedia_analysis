The '''[[Republic Aviation Company|Republic]] F-105 Thunderchief''', commonly known as the "Thud" by its crews, was a single-seat [[supersonic]] [[fighter-bomber]] used by the [[United States Air Force]]. The Mach-2 capable F-105 bore the brunt of strike bombing over North Vietnam early during the [[Vietnam War]]. It was later used in the specialized [[SEAD]] role suppressing missile sites.

As a follow-on to Mach 1 class F-100, the F-105 was also armed with missiles and a cannon. But its design was tailored to high-speed low-altitude penetration carrying a single [[nuclear bomb]] internally. First flown in 1955, the Thunderchief entered service in 1958. As the largest single-engined fighter ever employed by the USAF, the single-seat F-105 would be adapted to deliver a greater iron bomb load than the four-engined ten-man strategic bombers of [[World War II]]. The F-105 would be best remembered as the primary strike bomber over North Vietnam in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. After flying over 20,000 missions, 397 F-105s were lost, of which 63 were operational casualties. Although not designed for air combat, F-105s were also credited with 27.5 enemy aircraft.

During the war, the two-seat F-105F and F-105G [[Wild Weasel]] variants became the first dedicated [[SEAD|Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] ([[SEAD]]) platforms fighting against the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-built [[S-75 Dvina]] (SA-2 Guideline) [[surface-to-air missile]]s. Two Wild Weasel pilots earned the [[Medal of Honor]] attacking missile sites, with one shooting down two MiG-17s the same day. The dangerous missions often required them to be the "first in, last out" in order to suppress the threat air defenses prior to strike aircraft arriving and keeping them suppressed until the strike aircraft left the area.

Although the F-105 weighed 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), the aircraft could exceed the [[speed of sound]] at sea level and [[Mach number|Mach 2]] at high altitude. It could carry up to 14,000 pounds (6,700 kg) of bombs and missiles. The Thunderchief was later replaced as a strike aircraft over North Vietnam by both the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and the swing-wing [[F-111]]<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/f-111-history.htm GlobalSecurity F-111] "define a replacement for the F-105 fighter-bomber aircraft" </ref>. However, the "Wild Weasel" variants remained in service until 1984, when they were replaced by a specialized [[F-4]]G "Wild Weasel V".

==Design and development==
Republic Aviation started the Thunderchief as an internal project to replace the [[F-84 Thunderjet|F-84F Thunderflash]].<ref name="knaack"/> The design team led by [[Alexander Kartveli]] examined some 108 configurations before settling on a large, single-engine '''AP-63FBX''' (Advanced Project 63 Fighter Bomber, Experimental).<ref name="knaack"/> The new aircraft was intended primarily for [[supersonic]], low altitude penetration into the [[Soviet Union]] on a hi-lo-hi mission and delivery of a single, internally carried [[nuclear bomb]].<ref name="knaack"/> Thus, with emphasis placed on low-altitude speed and flight characteristics, range and payload, the aircraft would be fitted with a large engine, and a relatively small wing with a high [[wing loading]] which would give a stable ride at low altitudes, and less drag at supersonic speeds. 

Traditional fighter attributes such as maneuverability were a secondary consideration.<ref name="Green">Green, William and Swanborough, Gordon. ''The Great Book of Fighters''. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI Publishing, 2001. ISBN 0-7603-1194-3.</ref> Enthusiastic at first, the [[United States Air Force]] awarded Republic with a contract for 199 aircraft in September 1952. However, by March 1953 the USAF had reduced the order to 37 fighter-bombers and 9 tactical reconnaissance aircraft, citing the approaching end of the [[Korean War]].<ref name="knaack"/> By the time the F-105 mock-up had been completed in October 1953, the aircraft had grown so large that the [[Allison J71]] [[turbojet]] intended for it was abandoned in favor of an even more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75]]. Anticipating protracted development of the engine, it was expected that the first aircraft would use the smaller [[Pratt & Whitney J57]].<ref name="knaack"/> On [[28 June]] 1954, the USAF officially ordered 15 '''F-105A'''s under the Weapon System designation '''WS-306'''.<ref name="knaack"/>

The '''YF-105A''' prototype first flew on [[22 October]] [[1955 in aviation|1955]], with the second YF-105A following on [[28 January]] 1956.<ref name="Green"/> In spite of being powered by a less potent J57-P-25 engine with 15,000&nbsp;pound-force (66.7&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust (the J75 was expected to generate 24,500&nbsp;pound-force (109.0&nbsp;kN) with the afterburner), the first prototype attained the speed of [[Mach number|Mach&nbsp;1.2]] on its maiden flight.<ref name="knaack"/> Both prototypes featured conventional wing root air intakes and slab-sided fuselages typical of the early jets. However, insufficient power and aerodynamic problems with [[transonic]] [[drag (physics)|drag]], as well as [[Convair]]'s experience with their [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], led to a redesign of the fuselage in order to conform to the [[Area rule]], giving it a characteristic "wasp waist". In combination with the distinctive forward-swept variable-geometry air intakes which regulated airflow to the engine at supersonic speeds and the J75 engine, this enabled the resulting '''F-105B''' to attain Mach&nbsp;2.15.<ref name="knaack"/>

In March 1956, the USAF replaced its F-105A order with that for 65 '''F-105B'''. This model added the MA-8 fire control system with an AN/APG-31 ranging radar, and K-19 gunsight which allowed [[toss-bombing]]<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/avf105.html The Republic F-105 Thunderchief 01 apr 07 greg goebel]</ref> The first pre-production '''YF-105B''' flew on [[26 May]] 1956, and on [[June 19]] the aircraft was officially named '''Thunderchief''', continuing the Republic Aviation's nomenclature sequence of [[P-47 Thunderbolt]], [[F-84 Thunderjet]], and F-84F Thunderstreak/RF-84 Thunderflash.<ref name="knaack"/> The first production F-105B flew on [[14 May]] 1957.<ref name="knaack"/>

The F-105 was a mid-wing monoplane with a 45 degree [[swept wing]] and tail surfaces. The single engine was fed by two intakes in the wing roots, leaving the nose free for a [[radome]] housing the multi-mode [[radar]]. At the time, the F-105 was the largest single-seat combat aircraft ever built. Its capacious fuselage provided room for 1,160&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons (4,460&nbsp;L) of fuel and a bomb bay measuring 15&nbsp;feet 10&nbsp;inches by 32&nbsp;inches by 32&nbsp;inches (4.82&nbsp;m x 0.81&nbsp;m x 0.81&nbsp;m), originally intended for a single [[nuclear weapon]] but typically containing an additional 390&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallon (1,500&nbsp;L) fuel tank. Two underwing and one fuselage wet-stores-capable pylons were provided for 450 and 650&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallon (1,730&nbsp;L and 2,500&nbsp;L) expendable fuel tanks. Two outboard (dry) stations were wired for missiles or bombs. A single [[M61 Vulcan|T-171E3]] 20&nbsp;millimeter Gatling cannon was installed in the left side of the nose with a magazine for 1,028&nbsp;rounds of ammunition, combined with a radar ranging gunsight in B and D models. <ref name="knaack"/> The aircraft was designed to carry the short-range Sidewinder but it would not be equipped with the medium-range radar-guided missiles.

On [[11 December]] [[1959]], an F-105B piloted by Brig. Gen. Joseph Moore (commander of the 4th TFW)  set a world record of 1,216.48&nbsp;mph (1,958.53&nbsp;km/h) over a 100&nbsp;kilometer (62&nbsp;mi) circuit. Moore received the Bendix Trophy in 1959 for this feat.<ref name="knaack"/>

Plans to build over 1,500 F-105Ds were cut short when the Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] decided to equip no more than seven combat wings with the type. Production was cut in favor of the Air Force adopting the Navy's [[F-4 Phantom II]]. <ref>[http://home.att.net/~jbaugher1/f105_5.html] Baugher F-105</ref> A total of 833 F-105s were produced before production ended in [[1964 in aviation|1964]].

==Operational history==
[[Image:F-105 Thunderchief taking off.jpg|thumb|right|An F-105B Thunderchief taking off at Naval Air Station Barbers Point.]]
The F-105B entered USAF service with the [[Tactical Air Command]]'s [[335th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] on [[27 May]] [[1958 in aviation|1958]].<ref name="knaack"/> Typical of advanced aircraft, early F-105 service life was plagued by problems with [[avionics]] and the MA-8 [[fire-control system]], with the aircraft requiring some 150 hours of maintenance for each hour of flying time. Most of the problems were addressed under ''Project Optimize''.<ref name="Baugher">Baugher, Joe. ''Republic F-105 Thunderchief''. [http://home.att.net/~jbaugher1/f105.html] Access date: 3 March 2006.</ref> The lack of spares resulted in the entire F-105B fleet being briefly grounded in 1960.<ref name="knaack"/> Nevertheless, the Thunderchief became the first aircraft in USAF history to complete its first operational year without a single major accident.<ref name="Baugher"/>

By 1964, the F-105B was relegated to [[United States National Guard|Air National Guard]] squadrons.<ref name="knaack"/> It was replaced in frontline service by the definitive '''F-105D''' whose advanced NASARR R-14A radar and AN/ASG-19 Thunderstick fire-control system gave it all-weather performance.<ref name="knaack"/> The R-14A radar also added a [[terrain-following radar|terrain guidance]] capability.<ref name="knaack"/> The F-105D entered service with 335th TFS in 1960.<ref name="knaack"/> Designed for a European conflict with the [[Soviet Union]], the F-105D saw considerable deployment in West Germany to provide [[NATO]] with tactical nuclear strike capability, and in Japan.<ref name="knaack"/> Like the F-105B, the F-105D's early career was plagued with maintenance problems and in-flight failures. The origins of the nickname '''Thud''' were far from complimentary <U+2014> it stood for the sound of an F-105 crashing into the ground.<ref name="knaack"/> The entire F-105D fleet was grounded in December 1961 and then again in June 1962. Many of the issues were worked out during the production run and by 1964, early F-105Ds were upgraded with these fixes under project ''Look Alike'', although engine failures and fuel system problems persisted until 1967.<ref name="knaack"/>

Meanwhile, the USAF was gradually changing the anticipated F-105 mission from nuclear interdiction to conventional bombing.<ref name="knaack"/> The ''Look Alike'' upgrades increased the aircraft's capacity from four to sixteen conventional 750&nbsp;pound (340&nbsp;kg) bombs on underwing and fuselage centerline hardpoints and added the equipment to launch [[AGM-12 Bullpup]] air-to-ground missiles.<ref name="Baugher"/> In June 1961, an F-105D delivered 7&nbsp;tons (15,430&nbsp;lb) of conventional bombs during a USAF test <U+2014> at the time a record for a single-engine airplane and a heavier payload than [[World War II]]'s four-engined heavy bombers such as the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and the [[B-24 Liberator]], though aerial refueling would be required for long missions.<ref name="knaack"/> In fact, one of the F-105Ds was named ''Memphis Belle II'' after the [[Memphis Belle (B-17)|famed World War II B-17]].<ref name="knaack"/>

===Vietnam War===
[[Image:F-105D.jpg|thumb|right|F-105D on the ramp at Takhli]]
[[image:Thud Ridge.jpg|thumb|right|Location of the [[Thud Ridge]] and the MiG airfield on its southern tip.]]
In spite of a troubled early service life, the F-105 became the dominant attack aircraft during the [[Vietnam War]]. The F-105 could carry twice the bomb load further and faster than the F-100, which was used mostly in South Vietnam.<ref>''Republic F-105''. National Air and Space Museum [http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/aero/aircraft/republic_f105.htm] Access date: 2 March 2007.</ref> In a foreshadowing of its [[Wild Weasel]] role, the first F-105D combat mission of the war involved an attack of an anti-aircraft artillery site on [[Plaine des Jarres]].<ref name="knaack"/> The first Thunderchief of the war was also lost in this mission (the pilot managed to eject safely). The first strike mission took place on [[13 January]] 1965 with the destruction of the [[Ben Ken]] bridge in [[Laos]].<ref name="knaack"/> Following the start of [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] on [[1 March]] 1965, a large number of F-105Ds were deployed in [[Royal Thai Air Force Bases]] at [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base|Khorat]] and [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base|Takhli]]. On [[2 August]] 1967, F-105Ds from 335th and 338th Tactical Fighter Squadrons made the first of many successful raids on the [[Paul Doumer bridge]].<ref name="knaack"/> While the planes were first deployed with their original natural metal finish, they soon adopted the distinctive 2-green and tan Vietnam camouflage scheme which blended into the jungle landscape.

On a typical combat mission into North Vietnam, the F-105D carried two 450&nbsp;US gallon wing-mounted fuel tanks, a 390&nbsp;US gallon fuel tank in the bomb bay, and five 1,000&nbsp;pound (454 kg) or six 750&nbsp;pound (340 kg) bombs, and required [[Aerial refueling|inflight refueling]] both going to and sometimes returning from [[Hanoi]] 700&nbsp;miles (1,125&nbsp;km) distant. Thunderchiefs made a loop north of Hanoi over the valley of ''Thud Ridge'', {{coor dms|21|16|47|N|105|49|37|E}}  at a high speed and low altitude in order to avoid the heavily defended airspace around the city. Although the ridge would have provided proper shielding from the North Vietnamese radars and SAMs, the installment of anti-aircraft artillery and a [[Mikoyan|MiG fighter]] airfield at the southern end of the valley prevented the F-105s from fully exploiting the benefit of cover. The valley received the name, "[[Thud Ridge]]," (also the name of a book by Jack Broughton about the F-105) for its prominent role of covering the F-105s in their missions.<ref name="knaack"/>

==Air combat==

The F-105 was designed primarily for low-level interdiction and its low-altitude speed was its greatest asset when dealing with Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] fighters. The Thunderchief's [[wing loading|highly loaded wing]] was excellent for speed and smooth ride but not for sustained turns in a dogfight. Nevertheless, the F-105 managed 27.5&nbsp;air-to-air victories against [[North Vietnam|North Vietnamese]] aircraft at the cost of 17&nbsp;aircraft lost to enemy fighters (North Vietnamese pilots claimed to have shot down an additional 23&nbsp;F-105s but none have been confirmed by USAF).<ref name="Baugher"/> All victories were against MiG-17s -- 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missiles.<ref name="Futrell">Futrell R. Frank, Greenhalgh, William H., Grubb, C., Hasselwander, G.E., Jakob, R.F., and Ravenstein, C.A. ''Aces and Aerial Victories: The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia,  1965-1973''. Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History and the Albert F. Simpson Historical Research Center, 1976. ISBN 0-8987-5884-X.</ref>

On the basis of combat experience, the F-105D was updated with a better [[ejector seat|ejection seat]], radar homing and warning (RHAW) antenna on the tail fin, additional armor, and protection to the hydraulic system which proved to be very vulnerable to combat damage. The hot and humid climate of Southeast Asia created problems for the capricious electronics, a problem encountered by virtually all advanced US aircraft of the war. High ambient temperatures also exacerbated the F-105's propensity for engine fires due to inadequate cooling of the [[afterburner]]. Most of the Vietnam aircraft were eventually fitted with ram-air scoops to ameliorate this problem.<ref name="knaack"/>

Unfortunately, the low-altitude attacks and dive bombing brought the F-105s into the range of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire and the loss rates were so high that the USAF began experiencing shortages of combat-ready aircraft. A total of 382 aircraft were lost in Southeast Asia, 320 of those in combat. The vast majority of losses were the result of enemy ground fire. Of the 610 single-seat F-105Ds built, 283 were shot down and 52 lost operationally. Of the 143 F-105F/G two-seaters, 37 were shot down and ten lost operationally (one "Ryan's Raiders" night interdiction aircraft and one Combat Martin jammer without a back-seat WSO were lost in combat, the other 45 losses were Wild Weasel aircraft).<ref name="knaack"/>

===Special modifications===

The rear cockpits of several two-seat '''F-105F'''s were modified under project ''Commando Nail'' with an R-14A radar and a radar scope that offered high resolution. These aircraft were used for all-weather and night low-level strikes against especially dangerous targets by a unit from the [[44th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] dubbed "Ryan's Raiders" starting in April 1967. ''Commando Nail'' aircraft were also used to develop tactics for proposed [[B-58 Hustler]] bomber missions in Vietnam, although the Hustler was never deployed to Southeast Asia. Some of these aircraft were later converted to the Wild Weasel III standard.<ref name="knaack"/>

In an effort to thwart MiG attacks, several F-105Fs were also fitted with [[Hallicrafters]] QRC-128 [[VHF]] jammers under project ''Combat Martin''.  The North Vietnamese interceptor force followed Soviet air-defense doctrine, with pilots under rigid direction of ground controllers over radio links.  The QRC-128, nicknamed "Colonel Computer," filled up the rear cockpit of the F-105F and bounced voice communications over the radio channel back out after a delay, resulting in an obnoxious garble.  However, the first time the Combat Martin was used, the US [[National Security Agency]], in charge of US strategic [[signals intelligence]], ordered the Air Force to cease and desist immediately, since the NSA believed that the intelligence obtained by monitoring the channels outweighed the benefits of jamming them. <ref name = "Price">Price, Alfred. ''The History Of US Electronic Warfare, Volume III: Rolling Thunder Through Allied Force <U+2013>1964 to 2000''. New York: The Association Of Old Crows, 1989. ISBN 0-97037-940-4.</ref> Some of these aircraft were eventually brought to the Wild Weasel III standard.

Persistent problems with the AN/ARN-85 [[LORAN]] system resulted in 30 F-105Ds being upgraded to the AN/ARN-92 in a long dorsal spine. Known as ''Thunderstick II'' aircraft, these F-105s could achieve a bombing [[circular error probable]] of 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m) from an altitude of 15,000&nbsp;feet (4,570&nbsp;m). Although the first of these aircraft flew in 1969, they were never deployed to Vietnam.<ref name="knaack"/>

===Wild Weasel===
In 1965, the USAF began operating two-seat [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100F Super Sabres]] specially equipped for [[SEAD|Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] mission in Vietnam. Nicknamed the [[Wild Weasel]], these aircraft achieved 9 confirmed victories against North Vietnamese [[surface-to-air missile]] radars. The second crew member was an Electronic Warfare Officer, nicknamed the '''Bear''', whose job was to decipher the information from the aircraft's sensors and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution and because of its limited payload it usually had to rely on accompanying strike aircraft to actually attack the SAM sites. It also lacked the speed and the endurance to effectively protect the USAF's primary strike fighter <U+2014> the F-105. With twice the payload capacity of the Super Sabre and considerably better performance, the two-seat F-105F was an ideal candidate for a more definitive SEAD platform.<ref name="knaack"/>

The resulting '''EF-105F''' Wild Weasel III (the EF designation was popularly used but unofficial) supplemented its sensors and electronic jamming equipment with [[AGM-45 Shrike]] anti-radiation missiles and conventional bombs, giving it an offensive capability lacking in the F-100F. The first of these aircraft flew on [[15 January]] 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in June, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat and 6 more to the 354th TFS at Takhli. In a typical early mission, a single EF-105F would accompany one or two flights of F-105Ds to provide protection from enemy ground fire. While this strategy was effective in reducing F-105D losses, the Weasel aircraft suffered heavy casualties with five of the first 11 lost in July and August 1965.<ref name="knaack"/> Attacks into high-risk environments saw the Weasels operating in "Iron Hand"  Hunter-Killer flights of mixed single-seat and two-seat Thunderchiefs, suppressing sites during attacks by the strike force and attacking others during ingress and egress.

The EF-105Fs were upgraded to the definitive Wild Weasel Thunderchief, the '''F-105G''', with the first aircraft arriving in Southeast Asia in late 1967. The genesis of the F-105G was a PACAF policy that all USAF fighter-bombers operating over North Vietnam had to carry ECM pods, which served to degrade the Weasel's own electronics and occupied one ordnance wing hardpoint.

The F-105G incorporated a considerable amount of new SEAD-specific avionics, including an upgraded RHAW system which required a redesign of the wingtips. To free outboard hardpoints for additional weapons, the Westinghouse AN/ALQ-105 [[electronic countermeasures]] were permanently installed in two long blisters on the underside of the fuselage. Thirty aircraft were fitted with specially designed pylons to permit carrying of the [[AGM-78 Standard]] anti-radiation missile, a considerable improvement over the somewhat lackluster Shrike. On a typical mission, the F-105G carried two Shrikes on outboard pylons, a single Standard on an inboard pylon balanced by a 450&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallon fuel tank on the other side, and a 650&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallon centerline fuel tank. The Wild Weasel aircraft were usually the first to arrive in the target area and the last to leave, staying after the strike to support rescue of downed aircrews. As such, fuel was a precious commodity and it was not uncommon for a Wild Weasel to require a 30-minute leave for aerial refueling in order to continue its mission.<ref name="knaack"/>

Although the F-105D was withdrawn from Vietnam in 1970, the Wild Weasel aircraft soldiered on until the end of the war. They were gradually replaced by the F-4G Wild Weasel IV variant of the Phantom II.

===Medal of Honor recipients===
Two Wild Weasel pilots received the [[Medal of Honor]]:
* USAF [[Captain]] [[Merlyn H. Dethlefsen]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] and Capt [[Kevin "Mike" Gilroy]] the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] for an F-105F Wild Weasel mission on [[10 March]] 1967, flying F-105F 63-8352.<ref>{{cite web|last=Correll|first=JT|title=Calculated Courage at Thai Nguyen | url =http://www.afa.org/magazine/feb2006/0206courage.asp|accessdate=23 March 2006}}</ref> After their aircraft was damaged by ground fire, Dethlefsen and Gilroy elected to stay in the skies above the steel works at Thai Nguyen until the SAM site was found and destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colonel Merlyn H.

* USAF Captain [[Leo K. Thorsness]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] and Capt Harold Johnson the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]] for an F-105F Wild Weasel mission on [[19 April]] 1967, flying F-105F 63-8301.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frisbee|first=JL|title=Wild, Wild Weasel|url=http://www.afa.org/magazine/valor/0485valor.asp|accessdate=23 March 2006}}</ref><ref>[[s:Wild Weasel mission 19 April 1967|Audio excerpts and transcript of Maj Thorsness and Capt Johnson's mission on Wikisource]]</ref> Thorsness and Johnson protected an attempted rescue of another Wild Weasel crew that had been shot down, in the process destroying a MiG-17. After running out of ammunition, Thorsness and Johnson continued to act as decoys to draw the MiGs away from the rescue aircraft.

===Flying the F-105===
[[Image:F-105 Thunderchiefs refuel.jpg|thumb|right|F-105 Thunderchief refueling.]]
The initial reaction of the fighter pilot community to their new aircraft was lukewarm. Between its massive dimensions and troubled early service life, the F-105 had garnered a number of uncomplimentary nicknames. In addition to the aforementioned "Thud", F-105's nicknames included the "Squat Bomber," "Lead Sled," and the "Hyper Hog." With time, however, the F-105's responsive controls, excellent performance at high speed and low altitude, and sophisticated electronics won over even some of the [[F-104 Starfighter]] pilots. The "Thud" changed to a term of respect and endearment to the point where the [[F-84 Thunderjet|F-84F Thunderflash]] became known as the "Thud's Mother."<ref name="Higham">Higham, Robin and Williams, Carol. ''Flying Combat Aircraft of USAAF-USAF (Vol.1)''. Rockville, Maryland: Air Force Historical Foundation, 1975. ISBN 0-8138-0325-X.</ref>

Former [[F-86 Sabre]] pilot Jerry Noel Hoblit recalled the awe of the F-105's size after seeing it in person for the first time; he could not manage to reach the air intake lip even with a running jump.<ref name="Higham"/> The F-105 had a spacious cockpit with a good layout (particularly after introduction of "tape" instruments) and visibility (except to the rear), and the advanced electronics were easy to learn and operate. With high wing loading, the Thunderchief was by all accounts an excellent aircraft to fly at high speeds. Takeoffs and landings were often performed in the 230 mph (370 km/h) range. The [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] provided good roll control at all speeds and the distinctive four-petal airbrakes (which also opened slightly when the [[afterburner]] was engaged to allow for the larger flow of exhaust gases) were highly effective even at supersonic speeds. Loss of control due to a [[spin (flight)|spin]] or complications of [[adverse yaw]] required deliberate effort from the pilot and spontaneous spin recovery was rapid.<ref name="Higham"/>

==Obsolescence==
The Thunderchief was rapidly withdrawn from USAF service after the end of the Vietnam War.  Only 833 F-105 Thunderchiefs had been built; and having lost nearly 50% of that production figure in Vietnam, the F-105 was by military standards, nearly, no longer combat effective. Some aircraft remained in service with [[Air National Guard]] units, but their extended wartime service meant that many F-105s had already reached or exceeded their service lives by the mid-1970s. The Thunderchief was officially retired on [[25 February]] [[1984 in aviation|1984]].<ref name="knaack"/> The F-105 was replaced by the F-4 Phantom II.

In 1964, specially modified F-105Bs with ballast replacing the Vulcan cannon, a number of fuselage and wing reinforcements for aerobatics, and the addition of a smoke generator, briefly flew with the USAF [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbirds]] demonstration team. After only six shows, a fatal accident from overstressing the airframe forced a switch back to the [[F-100 Super Sabre]]. <ref>{{cite web|last=Goebel|first=Greg|title=The Republic F-105 Thunderchief|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avf105.html|work=Vectorsite|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref>
