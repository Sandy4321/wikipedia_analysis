'''Sir John Berry "Jack" Hobbs''' (16 December 1882&nbsp;<U+2013> 21 December 1963) was an English [[Professional sports|professional]] [[cricket]]er who played for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] from 1905 to 1934 and for [[England national cricket team|England]] in 61 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] between 1908 and 1930. Known as "The Master", he is regarded by critics as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the leading run-scorer and [[Century (cricket)|century]]-maker in [[first-class cricket]], with 61,760 [[run (cricket)|runs]] and 199 centuries.{{#tag:ref|Some sources, such as ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', credit Hobbs with 61,237 runs and 197 centuries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most Runs in First-Class matches|url=http://www.wisdenrecords.com/Records/First_Class/Overall/Batting/Most_Career_Runs.html|publisher=Wisden|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>|group=notes}} A right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm medium pace [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]], Hobbs also excelled as a fielder, particularly in the position of [[cover point]].

Born into poverty in 1882, Hobbs wished from an early age to pursue a career in cricket. His early batting was undistinguished, but a sudden improvement in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams. In 1903 he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman [[Tom Hayward]]. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game. Over the following seasons, he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England, scoring 83 in his first innings. After some mixed early performances for England, Hobbs' success against [[South Africa national cricket team|South African]] [[googly]] bowlers made his place secure, and by 1911<U+2013>12, when he scored three centuries in the series against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], critics judged him the world's best batsman. In county cricket, he developed an attacking, dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914. After serving in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] during the First World War, he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919, but his career was threatened by [[appendicitis]], which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was a more cautious batsmen and used a safer style of play. Subsequently, he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement. In this period, he played some of his most acclaimed innings.

Hobbs' success was based on fast footwork, an ability to play many different shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and [[Andy Sandham]] for Surrey and with [[Wilfred Rhodes]] and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2013 the most effective, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.

Hobbs was very close to Ada, his wife of 56 years; the pair were able to live comfortably in later life through Hobbs' substantial wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 and ran for the rest of his life. After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|Knighted]] in 1953, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured, he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.

From an early age, Hobbs played cricket whenever he could. His first games were played in the streets near his house.<ref name=M27>McKinstry, p. 27.</ref> He was educated at a [[St Matthew's Primary School|primary school]] affiliated with his local [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports.<ref name=M27/> He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team,<ref name=M32>McKinstry, p. 32.</ref> and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College.<ref name=A22>Arlott, p. 22.</ref> In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house.<ref>Arlott, pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref><ref name=M35>McKinstry, p. 35.</ref> On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an [[Courier|errand boy]] until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team.<ref name=M35/> Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter,<ref name=M35/> and practised cricket on [[Parker's Piece]], an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 33<U+2013>34.</ref> He played for various local clubs, although he did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication the success which came later.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref>

Hobbs' breakthrough came in 1901.<ref name=A22/><ref name=Mc38-9/> His batting improved throughout the season, during which he scored 102 for Ainsworth against the Cambridge Liberals,{{#tag:ref|Hobbs played for both of these teams throughout the season.<ref>McKinstry, p. 38.</ref>|group=notes}} his first [[Century (cricket)|century]]. At the end of the season, he was included in a Cambridge XI, a team chosen from the best local cricketers, to play a prestigious match against a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge-born [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] cricketer [[Tom Hayward]].<ref name=Mc38-9>McKinstry, pp. 38<U+2013>39.</ref> Although his overall record was unremarkable, at the end of the season he was invited to play as an [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]] for [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]]; but he achieved little in his appearances.<ref>Mason, p. 21.</ref>

Early in 1902, Hobbs was appointed as assistant to the professional cricket coach at [[Bedford School]],<ref name=McK39>McKinstry, p. 39.</ref> working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets.<ref name=A23>Arlott, p. 23.</ref> In late August, he returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]], Hobbs appeared for a team from the nearby town of [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] against Hertfordshire Club and Ground and scored 119 runs. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity.<ref name=M41-2>McKinstry, pp. 41<U+2013>42.</ref> Hobbs' father, who had helped to arrange his appearance in the match, died from [[pneumonia]] a week later.<ref name=M41-2/> Despite local fund-raising efforts for the bereaved family, Hobbs senior's death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Mc42-3>McKinstry, pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref> Francis Hutt, a former friend and colleague of the father, contacted [[Essex County Cricket Club]] to request a trial for Hobbs.

In the winter of 1902<U+2013>03 Hobbs  assumed his father's duties as groundsman at Jesus College.<ref name=Mc42-3/>

===Surrey cricketer===
Hobbs was summoned to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and subsequently offered a contract with the ground staff at [[the Oval]] on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week.{{#tag:ref|On top of this, Hobbs received match fees. During the winter, he received a retainer of one [[Pound sterling|pound]] each week.

Around this time he played [[Association football|football]] for local teams as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref>

While qualifying, Hobbs played for Surrey's Colts side and for the Club and Ground Eleven, both of which were teams for young cricketers. Although he made some substantial scores, according to his biographer, Leo McKinstry, "just as he had done for much of his early life, [Hobbs] performed satisfactorily without doing anything startling".<ref>McKinstry, p. 48.</ref> In the 1903 season he scored 480 runs at an [[Batting average#Cricket|average]] of 34.29, as well as taking 19 wickets as his bowling improved.<ref name=M49>McKinstry, p. 49.</ref> The following season, Hobbs played only for the Club and Ground, increased his average to 43.90, and impressed people connected with the Surrey county side.<ref name=M49/> His sudden improvement brought about a temporary return to the Cambridgeshire team, for which he remained qualified by birth. His batting was praised, particularly when he scored 195 and 129 in two matches against [[Hertfordshire County Cricket Club|Hertfordshire]]. In total, he scored 696 runs in 13 innings for Cambridgeshire, averaging 58.00.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 49<U+2013>50.</ref>

==First-class cricketer==
[[File:Hobbs and Hayward.jpg|thumb|Hobbs (right) opening the batting with [[Tom Hayward]] in 1907|alt=Two cricketers coming out of a pavilion, ready to bat]]
By the start of the 1905 season, Hobbs had qualified for Surrey and was already being noted as a player of promise.<ref name="M54">McKinstry, p. 54.</ref> At the time, Surrey needed an [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen|opening batsman]] to partner Tom Hayward.

''[[The Times]]'' noted that, although performing well, Hobbs had fallen short of the standards suggested by his start.<ref name=M61/>

After a winter of practice, Hobbs displayed greater consistency in 1906.<ref>McKinstry, p. 63.</ref> Displaying a wider range of shots, he scored four centuries, including another against Essex, and established an effective [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen|opening partnership]] with Hayward.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> Between his debut and Hayward's retirement in 1914, the pair shared 40 opening partnerships in excess of 100 runs.<ref name=A134>Arlott, p. 134.</ref> Hobbs was generally the junior partner,<ref name=ODNB/> and was overawed by Hayward, to the extent that he did not feel confident enough to invite him to his wedding.<ref name=McK67>McKinstry, p. 67.</ref> Hayward influenced Hobbs' mental approach, particularly his running between the wickets,<ref name=ODNB/> but the pair were dissimilar in style.{{#tag:ref|Hayward batted in the style of the late-nineteenth century, generally playing forward and [[Batting_(cricket)#Drive|driving the ball]] in most circumstances, and accustomed to facing fast bowlers.

===Dominance in South Africa===
Hobbs accepted an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. The cricketing conditions were challenging: matches were played on matting pitches, unfamiliar to English players, and the South African [[googly]] bowlers had previously troubled most leading English batsmen,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 98<U+2013>101.</ref> provoking debate over how batsmen could combat the new delivery.<ref name="Mason">Mason, p. 72.</ref> The MCC captain, Leveson Gower, selected [[Wilfred Rhodes]] to open the batting with Hobbs for the first Test.<ref name="McKinstry_a">McKinstry, p. 102.</ref> Rhodes, a defensively-minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles, had begun his career as a bowler who batted down the [[batting order (cricket)|order]]. He steadily improved his batting, eventually becoming an opening batsman.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 103<U+2013>05.</ref> Hobbs and Rhodes, between 1910 and 1921, opened the batting 36 times for England and shared eight century partnerships; their average of 61.31 runs per opening partnership remains the second highest in Test history.<ref name=Rajesh/><ref name=openers>{{cite web|title=Statistics: Statsguru: Test matches: Partnership records|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;partnership_wicketmax1=1;partnership_wicketval1=partnership_wicket;player_involve=306;template=results;type=fow|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref> In other first-class cricket, they shared a further five century opening partnerships.<ref name=A134/> Their association was notable for effective running; the pair developed such an unusually good understanding that they were able to run without calling to each other. They scored [[Single (cricket)|singles]] by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly. Critics believed that they raised the art of running to a new level.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 104<U+2013>05.</ref>

Although Rhodes was in the team, he did not open the batting owing to his poor form; Hobbs opened with [[Septimus Kinneir]].<ref>McKinstry, p. 125.</ref> England recovered to win the second Test; after bowling Australia out for 184 and taking a first-innings lead of 81, the visiting team eventually faced a  target of 219 to win. Hobbs and Rhodes, restored to the opening position, began with a partnership of 57. Hobbs scored 126 not out, his first century against Australia, and scored particularly well from the bowling of [[Ranji Hordern|H. V. "Ranji" Hordern]], a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in the first Test.<ref>McKinstry, p. 126.</ref> ''Wisden'' commented that Hobbs "played one of the finest innings of his life", and England won by eight wickets.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150209.html| title = England v Australia 1911<U+2013>12| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1913 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 12 April 2012}}</ref> Australia were once more bowled out for a low score in the third Test; this time Hobbs and Rhodes added 147 for the first wicket and Hobbs scored 187.

Having established a lead in the series, England began the fourth Test by bowling Australia out for 191. At the end of the first day, Hobbs and Rhodes had scored 54 together, and the next day they took their partnership for the first wicket to 323, setting a new record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches.

==First World War==
Unlike many other cricketers, Hobbs did not immediately join the army,<ref>McKinstry, p. 158.</ref> but worked in a munitions factory, possibly as a clerk. Writing later, Hobbs related that he was criticised for not joining up, but suggested he did not realise how serious the war would be, and was conscious of the need to care for his family. From March 1915 he found extra work as coach at [[Westminster School]],<ref>McKinstry, pp. 159<U+2013>61.</ref> and in May began to play on Saturdays as a professional for [[Idle, West Yorkshire|Idle]] in the [[Bradford Cricket League]]. The continuation of competitive cricket in Bradford, when all other such cricket had ceased, was controversial. Several clubs hired top-class professionals and matches became very popular. Although his arrival was eagerly anticipated, Hobbs never reached the expected heights, averaging 36.63 throughout the 1915 season.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 162<U+2013>64, 168.</ref> But his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] president [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]], who was highly critical of the employment of professionals, and John Booth, the president of the Bradford League.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 165<U+2013>68.</ref> Hobbs never publicly commented on the matter, but was instrumental in recruiting [[Frank Woolley]] to play in the league. He continued to play for Idle in 1916,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 168<U+2013>70.</ref> and was more successful, scoring 790 runs at 52.60 and taking 65 wickets at 6.27. But his [[Conscription in the United_Kingdom#World War I|conscription]] after the season into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] ended his regular cricket in the league.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 170<U+2013>71.</ref>

Hobbs joined the Corps in October 1916 as an [[Aircraftman|air mechanic]] and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; at first he had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|110 Squadron]] which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 172<U+2013>73.</ref> In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 174<U+2013>75.</ref> He was demobilised in February 1919.<ref>McKinstry, p. 175.</ref>

===Resumption of cricket===
When first-class cricket resumed in 1919,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 176<U+2013>77.</ref> Surrey awarded Hobbs a five-year contract worth <U+00A3>400 a year.<ref>McKinstry, p. 184.</ref> During the season, he began to open the batting with [[Andy Sandham]], who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner; in the following years, the pair established an effective partnership.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 179<U+2013>80.</ref> In total, they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket.{{#tag:ref|Although Hobbs and Sandham played three Test matches together, they never opened the batting in these matches, and shared just one partnership.<ref name=McK396/>|group=notes}}<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=McK396>McKinstry, p. 396.</ref> Like Hobbs' other successful partnerships, this one was based on quick running.<ref>Arlott, p. 90.</ref> Sandham, even when successful, was often overshadowed by his partner; on one occasion, Sandham scored a century but the headlines were reserved for Hobbs' [[Duck (cricket)|duck]]. Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 181<U+2013>82.</ref><ref>Marshall, p. 108.</ref>

Hobbs made a good start to the 1919 season and, despite a brief spell of failure through over-aggression,<ref>Arlott, pp. 86<U+2013>87.</ref> batted consistently.

In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 199<U+2013>201.</ref> He missed the rest of the season.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 204<U+2013>05.</ref>

Hobbs returned to cricket in 1922 and batted effectively throughout the first months of the season, scoring 10 first-class centuries in total.<ref name=M206-7>McKinstry, pp. 206<U+2013>07.</ref><ref name=Ma136>Mason, p. 136.</ref> One of the centuries came in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, in which he captained the Players team for the first time.<ref name=M206-7/> Towards the end of the season, his form faded owing to the lingering effects of his illness and operation the previous year. ''Wisden'' observed that he frequently tired during longer innings and often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures;<ref name=M208>McKinstry, p. 208.</ref> this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout the remainder of his career.<ref name=Ma136/> The season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks, in contrast to his adventurous pre-war tactics.<ref>McKinstry, p. 207.</ref> Second in the national batting averages for 1922,<ref name=M208/> he scored 2,552 runs at an average of 62.24,<ref name=fcbatting/> but declined an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC.<ref name=M208/> Less successful during the wet 1923 season, Hobbs failed on many occasions and was unsuccessful in both Gentlemen v Players games. He was still struggling with the after-effects of his operation and ''Wisden'' noticed he once more tried to score too quickly early in an innings.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 211<U+2013>12.</ref> However, against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], he scored the 100th century of his first-class career, the third man to reach the landmark after [[W. G. Grace]] and Hayward.<ref>Arlott, pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref> Overall in the season, he scored 2,087 runs at 37.95.<ref name=fcbatting/>

Hobbs signed a new contract worth <U+00A3>440 a season before the 1924 season.<ref>McKinstry, p. 243.</ref> His form recovered to the extent that his biographer, [[John Arlott]], described it as the beginning of "his quite phenomenal second lease of cricketing life".<ref name=A96>Arlott, p. 96.</ref> Batting conditions were good throughout the summer and Hobbs' opening partnership with Sandham for Surrey began to approach its peak of effectiveness.<ref>Mason, p. 140.</ref> Hobbs also established an opening partnership with Yorkshire's [[Herbert Sutcliffe]]; the pair had opened together briefly in previous seasons and were chosen to open in a Test trial early in 1924, beginning a six-year Test association.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=McK217/> They were often successful in difficult batting conditions;<ref name=ODNB/> Hobbs, generally the dominant partner, usually faced more of the bowling.<ref>McKinstry, p. 216.</ref> By the time of his retirement, they had opened the batting 38 times in Tests, shared 15 century opening partnerships, and added 3,249 runs together;<ref name=openers/> their average partnership was 87.81, the highest in all Tests for a pair of opening batsmen {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}.{{#tag:ref|The second best average opening partnership in Tests is that of 61.31 between Hobbs and Rhodes.<ref name=Rajesh/>|group=notes}}<ref name=Rajesh/><ref>McKinstry, p. 215.</ref> In all first-class matches, they had added 100 for the first wicket 26 times and had an average partnership of over 77.<ref name=A134/><ref name=McK396/> As with Hobbs' other partnerships, they ran well between the wickets, and established a particular reputation for reliability; according to McKinstry, they became an "English institution".<ref>McKinstry, pp. 215<U+2013>16.</ref> The cricket writer Gerald Howat suggests that {{"'}}Hobbs and Sutcliffe' became almost a synonym for English stability."<ref name=ODNB/>

Following their success in the 1924 trial match, Hobbs and Sutcliffe were selected for the England team to play the first Test against South Africa.<ref name=McK217>McKinstry, p. 217.</ref> When England batted first, the pair added 136 for the first wicket; Hobbs, playing a Test innings in England for the first time since 1912, scored 76. England won the match by a large margin.<ref>McKinstry, p. 219.</ref> In the second Test, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 268 runs for the first wicket; Hobbs scored 211, his highest Test score. At the time, the innings was the highest played at Lord's in a Test and equalled the highest in a Test match in England.<ref>McKinstry, p. 220.</ref> England scored 531 for the loss of two wickets and won the match by an innings.<ref name=figures/> Having initially declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC in the coming winter, Hobbs was left out of the team for the fourth Test. After the MCC accepted his request to allow his wife Ada to accompany him<U+2014>the wives of professionals were not usually permitted to tour<U+2014>he changed his mind,<ref name=M222-23>McKinstry, pp. 222<U+2013>23.</ref> and was added to the England team for the fifth Test.<ref name=M225>McKinstry, p. 225.</ref> In the series, he scored 355 runs at an average of 71.00,<ref name=tbat/> while in all first-class matches he totalled 2,094 runs at 58.16.<ref name=fcbatting/> He finished second in the national averages,<ref name=A96/> and the cricket press noted that, although Hobbs scored more slowly and in less spectacular fashion than previously, he batted in a safer, secure style which was more successful in terms of run-scoring.<ref name=M225/>

The MCC team which toured Australia under the captaincy of [[Arthur Gilligan]] in 1924<U+2013>25 lost the Test series 4<U+2013>1, although critics thought the winning margin flattered the host country.<ref name=M227>McKinstry, p. 227.</ref> Between them in the Test matches, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs.<ref name=M227/> Hobbs began the tour well, and scored consistently in the matches before the Tests.<ref name=figures/><ref name="McKinstry_c">McKinstry, p. 229.</ref> In the first Test, in reply to Australia's first innings of 450, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs.<ref name="McKinstry_c" /><ref>Mason, p. 149.</ref> Hobbs went on to his seventh century against Australia, beating the previous record number in England-Australia Tests by [[Victor Trumper]].

Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game, but England lost by 193 runs.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 230<U+2013>31.</ref> During the match, Hobbs became the leading run-scorer in Test cricket, passing the previous record of 3,412 runs set by [[Clem Hill]] in 1912.<ref name=Testrecord>{{cite web|last1=Binoy| first1=George| last2=Basevi | first2=Travis| title=A record Bradman never had|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/227714.html|publisher = ESPNCricinfo| date = 29 November 2005| accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> In the second Test, Australia scored 600 during the opening two days. In reply, Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated, scoring 283.

This suggestion provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke<U+2014>"Pray God, no professional will ever captain England"<ref>McKinstry, p. 234.</ref><U+2014>and subsequent press debate over the idea of Hobbs as captain.{{#tag:ref|Traditionally, captains in English county and Test cricket were amateurs, who usually came from privileged backgrounds, in contrast to professionals, who often came from the [[working class]]es.

Australia once more batted first in the third Test, scoring 489. For tactical reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe.

===Peak of popularity===
Hobbs was particularly successful in 1925. Early in the season a string of centuries, including a run of four in consecutive innings, made him the first batman to reach 1,000 runs that season and brought him close to Grace's record of 126 first-class hundreds.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 252<U+2013>54.</ref> He scored the 125th century of his career against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] on 20 July,<ref name=Ma156>Mason, p. 156.</ref> but amid intense press and public interest, Hobbs lost form through a combination of anxiety and fatigue. He continued to score well, but could not reach three figures in an innings<U+2014>after one innings of 54, a newspaper headline proclaimed that "Hobbs Fails Again".<ref>McKinstry, pp. 256<U+2013>57.</ref> It was not until 15 August, against Somerset, that Hobbs scored 101 to reached the landmark, an achievement praised and feted throughout the country over the following weeks. On the final day of the match, Hobbs scored another century to become the outright record holder.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 258<U+2013>63.</ref> He ended his season with an innings of 266 in a Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival, his highest to date and the best score made in the Gentlemen v Players series, and 104 for the Rest of England against Yorkshire, the County Champions.<ref name=M263>McKinstry, p. 263.</ref> In total, he scored 16 centuries<U+2014>setting a record for most centuries in a season<ref>Arlott, p. 100.</ref><U+2014>and totalled 3,024 runs at an average of 70.32 to top the national averages for the first time.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=M263/> Following his successful season, Hobbs was in great demand.

Hobbs was given a third benefit by Surrey in 1926 which raised <U+00A3>2,670.<ref name=M268>McKinstry, p. 268.</ref> Further recognition came when he and Rhodes joined the England selection committee for the Ashes series to be played that summer; for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented.<ref name=M268/> Hobbs began the season well,<ref>McKinstry, p. 270.</ref> and after the first Test, which was badly affected by rain, he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University, sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham; this remained a Surrey first wicket record {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 270<U+2013>71.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Highest Partnerships for First Wicket in First-Class matches| url= http://www.wisdenrecords.com/Records/First_Class/Overall/Batting/Highest_Partnerships_First_Wicket.html| publisher=Wisden |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> In the drawn second Test, he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182. Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings, leading to accusations that he was more concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 271<U+2013>72.</ref> The third Test was also drawn. England followed on in the face of a large Australian total, but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 273<U+2013>75.</ref> During the fourth Test, he temporarily assumed the captaincy when [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]] withdrew from the match owing to illness; Hobbs became the first professional to captain England at home. The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically. He scored 74 in England's innings, but heavy rain ensured a fourth successive draw.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 275<U+2013>78.</ref>

As everything depended on the [[Fifth Test, 1926 Ashes series|final game]], the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] agreed that the match be played to a finish.

Hobbs missed a large part of the 1927 season with a combination of illness and injury. In between his absences, he performed well, although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 294<U+2013>96.</ref> He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, including seven centuries.<ref name=fcbatting/> He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks.

In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership;<ref>McKinstry, pp. 298<U+2013>99.</ref> in the third, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe.<ref name="McKinstry 299">McKinstry, p. 299.</ref> England won the series 3<U+2013>0.<ref>McKinstry, p. 300.</ref> Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season; he finished second in the batting averages,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 298, 300.</ref> scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries.<ref name=fcbatting/> Critics believed he remained unsurpassed among English batsmen.<ref>McKinstry, p. 301.</ref>

===Final Tests===

Hobbs toured Australia for a final time as a player in 1928<U+2013>29 as part of a strong MCC team,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 301<U+2013>02.</ref> and despite substantial scores in early games, did not bat well.<ref>Mason, p. 174.</ref> He made little contribution to England's victories in the first two Tests,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 305<U+2013>06.</ref><ref name=Ma175>Mason, p. 175.</ref> and some critics noticed a decline in his batting, a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly-chosen shot in the first innings of the third Test for 20. Australia were able to build up a substantial lead, and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners. England needed 332 to win, but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried, a total of 100 was considered unlikely.<ref name=Ma175/><ref>McKinstry, pp. 309<U+2013>10.</ref>  Hobbs and Sutcliffe survived to add 105 for the first wicket; observers praised their technique against the turning ball, although the Australian bowlers were criticised for ineffective tactics.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 311<U+2013>12.</ref><ref>Mason, p. 176.</ref> Hobbs was out for 49;<ref name="Mason 177">Mason, p. 177.</ref> at his suggestion, [[Douglas Jardine]] came in to bat next, and England reached the end of the day having lost just one wicket for a score of 199.

Hobbs missed more cricket with injuries and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed more than a third of Surrey's matches.<ref>Mason, p. 178.</ref> However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref>Arlott, p. 112.</ref> Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 321<U+2013>22.</ref> Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.<ref>McKinstry, p. 322.</ref>

Hobbs began 1930 in good form,<ref name=M325>McKinstry, p. 325.</ref> and, with Rhodes, was added to the selection panel again for the Ashes series that season. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 and 74; he top-scored in both innings,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 326<U+2013>27.</ref> but failed in the next two Tests.<ref name=figures/> Before the third and fourth Tests, feeling tired and concerned by his form, he offered to stand down but the other selectors declined his suggestion.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 330<U+2013>31.</ref> When he batted in the fourth Test, he shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. After two hours batting, he was out for 31.<ref>McKinstry, p. 331.</ref> With the series level at 1<U+2013>1, the final Test was to be played to a finish, but before it began, Hobbs announced that it would be his last. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace's record career-aggregate of 54,896 first-class runs.<ref>McKinstry, p. 332.</ref> Before the deciding Test, the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain. Although the press speculated that Hobbs would replace him, [[Bob Wyatt]] was chosen; Hobbs may have turned down an offer of the captaincy at the meeting of selectors.{{#tag:ref|The ''News Chronicle'' newspaper reported that Hobbs had declined the captaincy, and a story circulated among county cricketers that such an offer had been made. Sutcliffe later told a team-mate that he was "disappointed" that Hobbs turned it down. The chairman of selectors, Leveson Gower, was a longtime supporter of Hobbs, which makes such a story plausible, according to McKinstry.<ref>McKinstry, p. 335.</ref>|group=notes}} In the match, Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings. When he came out to bat in the second, in the face of a large Australian first-innings lead, Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him [[three cheers]].

===End of career===
During the winter of 1930<U+2013>31, Hobbs and Sutcliffe joined a private team run by the [[Maharajkumar of Vizianagram]] which toured India and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. Hobbs was very popular with the crowds,<ref>McKinstry, pp. 343<U+2013>44.</ref> and scored 593 runs.<ref name=fcbatting/> These runs, and in particular the two centuries he scored, were to prove controversial.

Hobbs was partially involved in the [[Bodyline]] controversy in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932<U+2013>33|Australia in 1932<U+2013>33]]. Late in the 1932 season, [[Bill Bowes]] consistently bowled short-pitched deliveries against him in a match between Surrey and Yorkshire. Bowes was criticised in the press and particularly by [[Pelham Warner]], who was to manage the MCC team in Australia.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 348<U+2013>49.</ref> Hobbs accompanied the team to Australia as a journalist, writing for the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' and ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'', accompanied by his [[ghostwriter]] Jack Ingham. During the tour, Hobbs neither condemned Bodyline nor fully described the English tactics. Other journalists admired Hobbs but dismissed his writing as "bland".<ref>McKinstry, pp. 349<U+2013>51.</ref> When he returned to England, Hobbs openly criticised the English tactics in newspaper columns and in a book he wrote about the tour.<ref>McKinstry, p. 354.</ref> In 1933, playing less frequently, he scored 1,105 runs at 61.38,<ref name=fcbatting/> aged 50. After missing the first games with illness, he scored 221 against the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1933|touring West Indian team]], to the acclaim of the press.<ref>McKinstry, p. 355.</ref> He did not play every game, and the Surrey committee allowed him to choose which matches to play. More centuries followed later that season, which took him to 196 in his career, fuelling anticipation that he would reach 200 centuries.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 355<U+2013>56.</ref> That winter he accompanied the MCC team in India as a journalist.<ref>McKinstry, p. 357.</ref> Before the next season, Surrey constructed a new entrance to the Oval which was named after Hobbs.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 357<U+2013>58.</ref> In his final season, 1934, he scored 624 runs at 36.70.<ref name=fcbatting/> After a solid start, he scored his final first-class century against Lancashire. After this  he played irregularly, and his batting began to appear uncomfortable. Hobbs realised his career was over: in February 1935, he announced his retirement.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 360<U+2013>63.</ref> There were many tributes and a public dinner was held in his honour which was attended by many leading figures in cricket.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 364<U+2013>65.</ref> In all first-class cricket, Hobbs scored 61,760 runs at an average of 50.70 according to [[ESPNcricinfo]].<ref name=Cricinfo/> Later in 1935, Hobbs was made an honorary life member of Surrey.<ref name=ODNB/>

For much of Hobbs' career, critics judged him to be the best batsman in the world.<ref name=timesobit>{{Cite news | title = Sir Jack Hobbs: The Greatest Batsman of his Day | newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  13 | date = 23 December 1963 | url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1963-12-23-13-007&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1963-12-23-13| accessdate =28 October 2012}}{{subscription required}}</ref> [[E. W. Swanton]] described him in 1963 as "a supreme master of his craft, and the undisputed head of his profession".<ref>Swanton, p. 117.</ref> [[Neville Cardus]] said that Hobbs was the first batsman to develop a technique to succeed consistently against googly bowlers, and that he mastered all types of bowling, all over the world and in a variety of conditions.<ref name=Cardus>{{Cite news | last = Cardus | first = Neville | title = Sir Jack Hobbs<U+2014>Cricket's Supreme Artist | newspaper = The Guardian  | location = Manchester  | page =  8 | date = 23 December 1963}}</ref> Other critics have suggested that Hobbs moved the focus of batting from aesthetic off side shots to leg side play more suited to swing and googly bowling. Swanton wrote that Hobbs combined classical play with effective defence<U+2014>including protecting the wickets using his [[pads]]<U+2014>against the ball unexpectedly moving towards the stumps.<ref>Swanton, p. 119.</ref> His pad-play was controversial: it removed any possibility of dismissal but was regarded by some cricket authorities as negative and unsporting.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 286<U+2013>97.</ref>

Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs superior to Bradman, often regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket, on difficult pitches.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 43<U+2013>44.</ref> In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances.<ref name=timesobit/> Murphy suggests: "Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores."<ref name="M42">Murphy, p. 42.</ref> Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century<U+2014>roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110<U+2014>and was not particularly interested in most statistics.<ref name=M38>Murphy, p. 38.</ref> An article in ''Wisden'' in 2000 stated: "He was never as dominant as Bradman; he never wanted to be.

Hobbs' technique was based on strong forearms and good foot movement. [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]] suggested that "his footwork was, as near as is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body."<ref name=Crusoe10>Robertson-Glasgow, p. 10.</ref> He played every type of shot<U+2014>he did not have a "signature" shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively;<ref>Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref> according to [[Alec Kennedy]], who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do.<ref name="Arlott_c" /> In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot.<ref>McKinstry, p. 116.</ref> Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run;<ref name="M42"/> he also ran well between the wickets.<ref name="M42" /> He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them.<ref>Murphy, pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref> Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots.<ref name=M38/> After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age,<ref name="M42" /> and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period;<ref>Arlott, pp. 74<U+2013>75.</ref><ref>McKinstry, pp. 118<U+2013>19.</ref> Cardus wrote that "he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them."<ref name=Cardus/> This was the period in which he became known as "The Master",<ref name=M39>Murphy, p. 39.</ref> and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection;<ref name="M42"/>  98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.<ref name=M39/>

Hobbs was an occasional medium-paced bowler who bowled a [[Good length ball|good length]] and made the ball swing. Some critics judged him to be a potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 110<U+2013>11.</ref> As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|covers]] and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the [[wicket-keeper]]. Contemporaries believed him to be one of the best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 131<U+2013>32.</ref>

Although a professional<U+2014>captains at the time were almost exclusively amateurs<U+2014>the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain, and many, although not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 178<U+2013>79, 276<U+2013>77.</ref>

==Reputation and legacy==
Hobbs was twice selected as ''Wisden's'' Cricketer of the Year, in 1909 and 1926; only he and Pelham Warner have received this award twice.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/209422.html |work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 2012 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |title= Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year| isbn = 978-1-4081-5694-0 |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> In 1963, [[Neville Cardus]] chose him as one of the best six cricketers of the previous 100 years, to mark ''Wisden's'' centenary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152764.html |work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1963 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |title= Six giants of the Wisden century| accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref>  More recently, Hobbs was selected by a panel of experts in 2000 as one of five ''Wisden'' cricketers of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153387.html |work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 2000 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |title=Five cricketers of the century |accessdate=28 October 2012|isbn=0-947766-57-X}}</ref> In 2009, he was selected by cricket historians and writers as a member of England's all-time best team,<ref>{{cite web|last=Frith|first=David|title=What does this team tell us?|url =http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/421937.html| publisher=ESPNCricinfo| accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> and included in a similar team to represent the best players worldwide in the history of cricket.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tendulkar only current player in ESPNcricinfo all-time World XI|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/482936.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> Hobbs' Test batting average of 56.94 remained {{as of|2013|lc=yes}} the fifth best among batsmen to have passed 5,000 runs, despite a rise in the number of batsmen who average more than 50 since 2000. Among openers who have scored 5,000 Test runs, he has the third best average behind Sutcliffe and [[Len Hutton]]. He was comfortably the leading Test run-scorer during his career, and had the highest number of Test runs at the time of his retirement. Between 1910 and 1929, he averaged 65.55 in Test cricket.<ref name=Rajesh>{{cite web|last=Rajesh|first=S|title=First-class cricket's most prolific batsman|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/453661.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>

Gideon Haigh suggests that Hobbs was a "spontaneous and original", trend-setting batsman who was not afraid to depart from orthodoxy.<ref name=Haigh>{{cite web|last=Haigh|first=Gideon|title=For love (and money)|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/409812.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=20 June 2009}}</ref> Gerald Howat notes that, aside from his batting achievements, "Hobbs's biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note. He was a man of moral probity, religious conviction, and personal commitment. And he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent, which he put into its proper perspective. It was an attitude of mind which tempered the sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes."<ref name=ODNB/> Among his contemporaries, Hobbs was regarded as modest and kind, and never criticised other players. He avoided confrontation, although he was "quietly determined", according to ''Wisden'', and tried to avoid publicity.<ref name=century/> According to Fender, Hobbs "gave stature" to the profession of cricket.<ref>Marshall, p. 34.</ref> Modern critics have expressed some reservations: some have pointed out that his batting average, although high, has been surpassed by others, and that among his many centuries, few were as large as other players managed.<ref name=century/> However, others contend that his impact on the game, his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs, and his kindness place him among the top cricketers of all time.<ref>{{cite web |last = Engel | first = Matthew | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153387.html |work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 2000 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |title=Five cricketers of the century|accessdate=28 October 2012|isbn=0-947766-57-X}}</ref> ''Wisden'' described him in 2000: "More than anyone else, he lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer."<ref name=century/> In summing up his place in history, it said: "He was not an artist, like some of his predecessors, nor yet a scientist, like some of the moderns; he was perhaps the supreme craftsman."<ref name=century/>

==Personal life==

===Family life===
In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at an evening church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The relationship was slowed by Hobbs' shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. Although they planned to keep the event quiet, it was reported in the press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 66<U+2013>67.</ref> Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas.<ref name=ODNB/> They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 68<U+2013>69.</ref>

Hobbs and his wife lived in rented property for the first years of their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of [[lower middle class]] according to McKinstry: although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable.<ref>McKinstry, p. 69.</ref> Hobbs' wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913, he was earning <U+00A3>375 each year, placing his family within the bracket of the London [[middle class]]. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in [[Clapham Common]], a prosperous area of London.<ref>McKinstry, p. 142.</ref> By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around <U+00A3>780 each year), the income from his business,<ref name=Mc240-5/> product endorsement<U+2014>he was one of the first cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products<ref name=ODNB/><U+2014>and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached <U+00A3>1,500 a year by 1925, more than a family doctor at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools.<ref name=Mc240-5>McKinstry, pp. 240<U+2013>45.</ref> He had greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood.<ref name=ODNB/>

===Retirement and final years===
Following his retirement from cricket in 1934, Hobbs continued to work as a journalist, first with Jack Ingham then with Jimmy Bolton as his ghostwriters. He accompanied the MCC team to Australia in 1936<U+2013>37 and published four books which sold well in the 1930s. In addition, he produced two ghostwritten autobiographies, but generally avoided self-publicity or controversy.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 366<U+2013>67.</ref> He continued to work at his sports shop and he and Ada moved home several times. By the mid-1930s, his wife was becoming mentally and physically frail.<ref>McKinstry, p. 368.</ref> Hobbs supported several charities in his spare time and continued to play cricket at club and charity level.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 369<U+2013>70.</ref> During the Second World War, Hobbs served in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] at [[New Malden]].<ref>McKinstry, p. 371<U+2013>72.</ref> In 1946, Hobbs became the first professional to be elected to the Surrey committee. The same year, he and his wife moved to [[Hove]], following several years of health concerns and worries over his business and children.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 374<U+2013>75.</ref> Ada's health continued to deteriorate, and the couple spent some time in South Africa in an attempt to aid her recuperation.<ref>McKinstry, p. 376.</ref>

In 1953, Hobbs was [[Orders, decorations, and_medals of the United_Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]], the first professional cricketer to be so honoured. He was reluctant to accept and only did so when convinced that it was an honour to all professional cricketers, not just himself.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 377<U+2013>78.</ref> In the same year, John Arlott formed the "Master's Club", a group of Hobbs' friends who met regularly to toast him.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 378<U+2013>79.</ref> Hobbs remained active into the 1960s, including working in his shop. By the late 1950s, Ada was wheelchair-bound and Hobbs spent most of his time caring for her. She died in March 1963. Hobbs' health began to fail shortly afterwards and he died on 21 December 1963 at the age of 81.<ref>McKinstry, pp. 380<U+2013>81.</ref> He left <U+00A3>19,445 in his will and was buried in Hove Cemetery. A memorial service was held at [[Southwark Cathedral]] in February 1964.<ref>McKinstry, p. 382.</ref>
