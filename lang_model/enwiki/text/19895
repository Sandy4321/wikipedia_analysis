After looking at many auditions for the role of Olivia Dunham, Australian actress [[Anna Torv]] was selected for the part. Casting director April Webster commented, "What we were looking for in Olivia was a woman who was believable as a FBI agent but yet had some vulnerability. And definitely had depth and a history behind her eyes."<ref name=dvdcasting>{{cite video |people=April Webster, [[Alex Kurtzman]], [[J.J. Abrams]], [[Alex Graves]], Kathy Lingg |date=2009 |title=The Casting of ''Fringe''  | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] Television |location=''Fringe'': The Complete First Season Disc 2 }}</ref> They came across an audiiton tape of Torv for another movie, and were "immediately intrigued"; Webster called a friend in Australia, and were able to arrange an audition with Torv, who was camping at the time she received the call. Torv read for a few scenes over the Internet, and was told the following day that she had won the role, embarking for [[Toronto]] soon after to begin shooting. One later called her casting "the miracle of the whole thing".<ref name=dvdcasting/>

===Characterization===
Olivia is a [[loner]] and dedicates almost all of her time to her work.  She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and annoys Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects.

Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself.<ref name=foxbio/> She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Cure|episodelink=The Cure (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=Bill Eagles (director), [[Felicia D. Henderson]] (writer), [[Brad Caleb Kane]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2008-10-21 |season=1 |number=6}}</ref> She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew what she wanted to do for a career "pretty much since [she] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.

===Relationships===
Olivia has few close relationships. She has little family, as her mother died when she was in her early teenage years. Olivia's is close to her sister [[Rachel Dunham (Fringe)|Rachel]], and Rachel's daughter Ella.<ref name=foxbio/>

She was involved in a serious relationship with fellow FBI agent John Scott,<ref name=foxbio/> and his supposed betrayal and death was a hard burden to deal with.

==Storylines==
Olivia Dunham is a young [[FBI Special Agent]] assigned to a multi-agency [[task force]] of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] called the "Fringe Division",<ref name=foxbio>{{cite web |url=http://www.fox.com/fringe/bios/anna-torv/ |title=Anna Torv as Special Agent Olivia Dunham: Character Bio |author=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |date=|accessdate= 2011-04-15}}</ref> after her partner and lover, [[List of Fringe characters#John Scott|John Scott]], is exposed to a flesh-dissolving agent. Both [[List of Fringe characters#Phillip Broyles|Agent Broyles]] and [[List of Fringe characters#Nina Sharp|Nina Sharp]] consider her to have much potential and talent, the latter even hoping to bring her on as an employee of Massive Dynamic.

An experiment by [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Dr. Bishop]] to link her to the dying John Scott's mind in order to learn what he knew about his condition results in Olivia gaining part of his consciousness, causing her mind to begin integrating and purging the foreign consciousness. This results in Olivia mistaking John Scott's memories for her own.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Safe|episodelink=Safe (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Michael Zinberg]] (director), [[David H. Goodman]] (writer), [[Jason Cahill]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2008-12-02 |season=1 |number=10}}</ref> With help from Walter, Olivia finds a way to communicate with John within her own mind, eventually allowing the memories to fade completely.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Transformation|episodelink=The Transformation |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] (director), [[Zack Whedon]] (writer), [[J.R.

A second plot line linked to Olivia is the drug Cortexiphan, a chemical developed by William Bell which supposedly allows children injected with it to retain higher brain functions which would normally deteriorate with age. Olivia was one of a group of preschool-age children who served as subjects of the experiment in her childhood home of [[Jacksonville, Florida]].  As a result, Olivia is capable of unspecified psychic abilities, as demonstrated when she shuts off a series of lights wired into a bomb as a kill switch simply by thinking it.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Ability |episodelink=Ability (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Norberto Barba]] (director), [[Glen Whitman]] (writer), [[Robert Chiappetta]] (writer), [[David H.

Olivia also had the ability to discern if an object originated in the alternate dimension due to a "glimmer" that only she could see.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/01/21/fringe-promises-to-address-olivia-dunham-peter-bishops-true-origins-in-februarys-winter-finale/ |title='Fringe' Promises To Address Olivia Dunham & Peter Bishop's True Origins In February's Winter Finale |first=Josh |last=Wigler |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate= 2011-04-15}}</ref> When trying to reawaken this ability in her as an adult, Dr. Bishop hypothesized that this ability was partially derived from Olivia's fear about seeing into the alternate dimension.  When Olivia regains part of her memories of her meeting with Bell, she is told that she is the only successful subject suitable to pass through dimensions without many known negative side-effects. She has been called the guardian of the gateway by Bell, who will prevent the invasion by the alternate dimension.<ref name=momentumdeferred>{{cite episode |title=Momentum Deferred|episodelink=Momentum Deferred|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Zack Stentz]] (writer), [[Ashley Edward Miller]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2009-10-08 |season=2 |number=4}}</ref>

At the end of the first season, Olivia is given permission by Nina Sharp to meet [[List of Fringe characters#William Bell|William Bell]], who currently resides in another dimension, with his office in the [[World Trade Center]]'s [[South Tower]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=There's More Than One of Everything|episodelink=There's More Than One of Everything|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer), [[J.

She ends up in a short coma and wakes up in an incoherent state and in shock. Olivia apparently loses her memories of her meeting with Bell and whatever information he may have told her.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A New Day in the Old Town|episodelink=A New Day in the Old Town|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Zack Stentz]] (writer), [[Ashley Edward Miller]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2009-09-17 |season=2 |number=1}}</ref> She regains part of those memories and learns more about the invasion between dimensions.<ref name=momentumdeferred/>

In the season two finale, Olivia meets her alternate self, (deemed "Fauxlivia" by Walter, also called "Altlivia" by some fans, much like "Walternate") in the alternate universe before sharing a kiss with [[Peter Bishop]]. She is trapped in the alternate universe by Walternate and her other self has taken over her place in the prime universe.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Over There Part 2|episodelink=Over There (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Akiva Goldsman]] (director and writer), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer), [[J.

In season three, Olivia attempts to escape her imprisonment and travel back to her own universe. She is captured and drugged, [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] into believing that she is the alternate Olivia, complete with traits such as superb marksmanship skills which prime-universe Olivia did not possess.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Olivia|episodelink=Olivia (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer), [[J.

==Reception==
[[File:Anna Torv.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Reviews of Anna Torv's perfomance have ranged from positive to mixed.]]
Reviews of Torv's performance were mixed in the first season. In his review of the [[Pilot (Fringe)|pilot episode]] for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', John Leonarwas found Torv "wonderfully played" her character.<ref>{{cite web | author=Leonard, John | title=New Abnormalities | url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/reviews/50205/ | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=2008-09-12 | accessdate=2011-04-15 }}</ref> [[IGN]]'s Travis Fickett agreed, calling Torv's early work on ''Fringe'' "very good" as she "brings a unique presence to the show."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/911/911100p1.html |title=Fringe: "Same Old Story" Review |first=Travis|last=Fickett |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate= 2011-04-15}}</ref> [[MSNBC]] was equally praiseworthy of Torv and her character, writing "Olivia is the soul of the show <U+2014> two-fisted and defiant, yet vulnerable. Torv knows how to convey authenticity, even in the midst of an outrageous scene. And sporting sensible pantsuits and just a hint of makeup, she makes Olivia a plausibly gorgeous pro, not a crime-busting tootsie."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28913906/ns/today-entertainment/ |title=Anna Torv: Making <U+2018>Fringe<U+2019> a mainstream hit  |first=|last=|author=[[MSNBC]] |date=2009-02-02 |accessdate= 2011-04-15}}</ref> 

In a response to some negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted in a review of the season's [[In Which We Meet Mr. Jones|seventh episode]] that "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing ''Fringe'' is totally lacking it is sexual tension."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/fringe-107-in-which-we-meet-mr-jones-reviewed |title=Fringe 1.07 - In Which We Meet Mr. Jones - Reviewed  |first=Jon |last=Lachonis|publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2011-04-15}}</ref>
