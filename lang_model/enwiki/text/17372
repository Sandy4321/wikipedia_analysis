A '''simmelian tie''' (can be capitalized as a '''Simmelian tie'''<ref name=krack1999/>) is a type of an [[interpersonal tie]], a concept used in the [[social network analysis]]. For a simmelian tie to exist, there must be a three (a [Triad (sociology)|triad]]) or more of reciprocal strong ties in a group. A simmelian tie is seen as an even stronger tie than a regular strong tie.

==Definition and an example==
Whereas the basic ties are known as strong or weak and focus on the strength of the analyzed relationship, simmelian ties are concerned with more than just the strength of the relationship.<ref name=CaK/> They look at the number of strong ties within a group. For a simmelian tie to exist, there must be a three (a [Triad (sociology)|triad]]) or more of reciprocal strong ties in a group.<ref name=CaK/><ref name=krack1999/> A simmelian tie is seen as an even stronger tie than a regular strong tie.<ref name=CaK/>

For example, if Adam has a strong tie to Betty, and both Adam and Betty share a strong tie to Charles, this three-way tie would be a simmelian one.<ref name=CaK>Collier and Kraut (2012) Leading the Collective: Social Capital and the Development of Leaders in Core-Periphery Organizations http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3682 </ref>

==History and use==
The concept of a Simmelian tie has been developed by [[David Krackhardt]] in his 1999 paper, ''The ties that torture: Simmelian tie analysis in organizations. Research in the Sociology of Organizations''.<ref name=krack1999>Krackhardt, D. (1999). The ties that torture: Simmelian tie analysis in organizations. Research in the Sociology of Organizations, (16), 183-210. [http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/krack/documents/pubs/1999/1999%20The%20Ties%20that%20Torture.pdf]</ref> Krackhardt developed the concept of a simmelian tie as an alternative to [[Ronald Burt]]'s [[structural hole theory]].<ref name=krack1999/>

It is based on the concept developed by the German sociologist, [[Georg Simmel]].<ref name=krack1999/>

The concept of a Simmelian tie is related to that of a [[clique]]; each pair of nodes (individuals) in a clique has a Simmelian tie between them.<ref name=krack1999/> Thus a simmelian tie can be defined as a tie in a clique, or a co-clique relationship (between individuals who belong to a specific clique).<ref name=krack1999/>

A simmelian tie strengthens the relationship (tie) between the individuals, but it is also restricting - it subjects those individuals to a [[group norm]].<ref name=krack1999/> In his original paper, Krackhardt stressed that restrictions, noting that the more cliques one has simmelian ties too, the more constrained one is.<ref name=krack1999/>

The concept of a simmelian tie is used in the [[social network analysis]].<ref name=CaK/> It has been used in the [[study of organizations]], including [[Wikipedia]].<ref name=CaK/><ref name=krack1999/>
