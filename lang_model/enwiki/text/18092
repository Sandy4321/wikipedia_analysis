The '''Battle of Pusan Perimeter''' was fought in August and September 1950 between [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] forces combined with [[South Korea]]n forces against the forces of [[North Korea]].  The Pusan Perimeter was the area in extreme southeast [[Korea]] which was defined by the farthest advance of the North Korean troops during the [[Korean War]].  It extended along {{convert|140|mi|km}} and was named after the coastal city of [[Busan|Pusan]]. Much of its length coincided with the course of the [[Nakdong River]]. The Pusan Perimeter served primarily as an [[airhead]] for resupply and reinforcement until the [[Inchon landing]], and counterattack against the North.

==Background==
===Outbreak of war===
Following the outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea), the [[United Nations]] decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the [[Far East]] had been steadily decreasing since the end of [[World War II]], five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] of the [[Eighth United States Army]], which was headquartered in [[Japan]]. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea.<ref name="Var3">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}</ref>

[[File:US Retreat from Taejon.jpg|thumb|alt=A city square filled with soldiers and civilians. Smoke is in the sky in the background behind a large building.|US Forces retreat during the [[Battle of Taejon]]]]
The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial "shock" of North Korean advances, delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow follow on forces to arrive.<ref name=Alexander52>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=52}}</ref> The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans, making time for the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position.<ref name=Alexander52/> Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the [[Battle of Osan]] on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=15}}</ref> For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment.<ref name="Var4">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=4}}</ref><ref name="Alex90">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=90}}</ref> The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], and [[Battle of Pyongtaek|Pyongtaek]].<ref name="Var4"/> The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the [[Battle of Taejon]], being almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20.<ref name="Alex105">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=105}}</ref> By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.<ref name="Fehr103">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=103}}</ref>

===North Korean advance===
With Taejon captured North Korean forces began the effort of surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it. The [[4th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 4th Infantry Division]] and the [[6th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 6th Infantry Division]] advanced south in a wide maneuver. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. They advanced on UN positions pushing back US and South Korean forces repeatedly.<ref name="Apple222">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=222}}</ref>

In the east, the North Korean army, 89,000&nbsp;men strong, had advanced into South Korea in six columns, catching the [[Republic of Korea Army]] by surprise, resulting in a complete rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and it was unprepared for war.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=1}}</ref> Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000&nbsp;South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=2}}</ref> Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. By June 28, the North Koreans had captured South Korea's capital of [[Seoul]], forcing the government and its shattered forces to retreat further south.<ref>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=2}}</ref> Though it was steadily pushed back, South Korean forces increased their resistance further south hoping to delay North Korean units as much as possible. North and South Korean units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The [[Republic of Korea Army]] forces defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back. They performed well in the [[Battle of Andong]] in repelling North Korean advances.<ref name="Catch22">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2003|p=22}}</ref>

In the west, US forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, [[29th Infantry Regiment]], newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at [[Hadong]] in a [[Hadong Ambush|coordinated ambush]] by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area.<ref name="Apple221">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=221}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=114}}</ref> Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces.<ref name="Catch24">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=24}}</ref> US Units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the [[Battle of the Notch]] on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Catch25"/><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=247}}</ref>

==Prelude==
===Terrain===
The UN forces established a perimeter around the port city of Pusan throughout July and August 1950. Roughly {{convert|140|mi}} long, the perimeter stretched from the [[Korea Strait]] to the [[Sea of Japan]] west and north of Pusan.<ref name="Stewart225"/> To the west the perimeter was roughly outlined by the [[Naktong River]] where it curved at the city of [[Taegu]], except for the southernmost {{convert|15|mi}} where the Naktong turned eastward after its confluence with the [[Nam River]].<ref name="Apple252">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=252}}</ref> The northern boundary was an irregular line that ran through the mountains from above [[Waegwan]] and [[Andong]] to Yongdok.<ref name="Stewart225">{{harvnb|Stewart|2005|p=225}}</ref>

With the exception of the Naktong [[River delta|delta]] to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohong-dong, the terrain is extremely rough and mountainous. Northeast of P'ohong-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the South and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a natural defense.<ref name="Apple253">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=253}}</ref> However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the north.<ref name="Apple255">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=255}}</ref>

UN forces in this region also suffered from casualties related to the heat of the summer, as the Naktong region has little vegetation and clean water.<ref name="Apple262">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=262}}</ref> Korea suffered from a severe drought in the summer of 1950, receiving only 5&nbsp;inches of rain as opposed to the normal 20 during the months of July and August. Combined with temperatures of 105 degrees Fahrenheit, the hot and dry weather contributed to a large number of heat and exertion casualties, particularly for the unconditioned American forces.<ref name="Alex127"/>

===Forces involved===

[[File:Marines at Pusan.jpg|thumb|alt=Men in trucks and military uniforms park in a town |US Marines disembark at Pusan on their way to the front lines.]]
The [[North Korean People's Army]] forces were organized into a [[mechanized warfare|mechanized]] [[combined arms]] force of ten [[division (military)|divisions]], originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, with hundreds of [[T-34]] Tanks.<ref name="Stewart225"/> However, defensive actions by US and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops and a large number of tanks.<ref name="Stewart226"/> In order to recoup these losses, the North Koreans had to rely on less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom had been taken from the conquered regions of South Korea.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=116}}</ref> During the course of the battle, the North Koreans raised a total of 13 [[infantry]] divisions and one [[armored warfare|armored]] division to the fight at Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Stewart226">{{Harvnb|Stewart|2005|p=226}}</ref>

[[File:IncheonLandingMcArthur.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] (center) retained overall command of the UN forces during the fight at Pusan.]]
The United Nations forces were organized under the command of the [[United States Army]]. The Eighth United States Army served as the headquarters component for the UN forces, and was headquartered at Taegu.<ref name="Fehr108">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=108}}</ref><ref name="Catch19">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=19}}</ref> Under it were three weak US Divisions; the 24th Infantry Division was brought to the country early in July, while the 1st Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division arrived between July 14 and July 18.<ref name="Apple254"/> These forces occupied the western segment of the perimeter, along the Naktong river.<ref name="Stewart226"/> The [[Republic of Korea Army]], a force of 58,000,<ref name="Catch20">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=20}}</ref> was organized into two [[corps (military)|corps]] and five divisions; from east to west, [[I Corps (South Korea)|ROK I Corps]] controlled the [[8th Infantry Division (South Korea)|8th Infantry Division]] and [[Capital Division (South Korea)|Capital Division]]s, while the [[II Corps (South Korea)|ROK II Corps]] controlled the [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Division]] and [[6th Infantry Division (South Korea)|6th Infantry Division]]. A reconstituted ROK [[3rd Infantry Division (South Korea)|3rd Division]] was placed under direct ROK Army control.<ref name="Apple253"/><ref name="Fehr109">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=109}}</ref>  Morale among the UN units was low due to the large number of defeats at that point in the war.<ref name="Apple255"/><ref name="Fehr108"/> US Forces had suffered over 6,000 casualties over the past month while the South Korean Army had lost an estimated 70,000.<ref name="Apple262"/><ref name="Fehr113">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=113}}</ref>

Troop numbers at the beginning of the battle were initially difficult to estimate for US and North Korean forces. Subsequent research indicates that the North Korean army had around 70,000 combat troops committed to the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, with most of its divisions far understrength.<ref name="Fehr113"/><ref name="Apple263">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=263}}</ref> It likely had less than 3,000 personnel in mechanized units, and around 40 T-34 tanks at the front due to extensive losses so far in the war.<ref name="Fehr113"/><ref name="Apple264">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=264}}</ref> MacArthur reported 141,808 UN troops in Korea on August 4, of which 47,000 were in US ground combat units and 45,000 were in South Korean combat units. Thus the UN ground combat force outnumbered the North Koreans 92,000 to 70,000.<ref name="Fehr113"/><ref name="Apple264"/> UN Forces had complete control of the air and sea throughout the fight as well, and US Air Force and US Navy elements provided support for the ground units throughout the battle virtually unopposed.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=114}}</ref> Overall command of the naval force was taken by the [[US Seventh Fleet]], and the bulk of the naval power provided was also from the US.<ref name="Marolda14">{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=14}}</ref> The United Kingdom also provided a small naval task force including an aircraft carrier and several cruisers. Eventually, [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] provided ships as well.<ref name="Marolda15">{{harvnb|Marolda|2007|p=15}}</ref> Several hundred fighter-bombers of the [[Fifth Air Force]] were positioned just off the coast aboard the [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|USS ''Valley Forge'']] and the [[USS Philippine Sea (CV-47)|USS ''Philippine Sea'']].<ref name="Alex126">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=126}}</ref> By the end of the battle the Eighth Army had more air support than [[General]] [[Omar Bradley]]'s [[Twelfth United States Army Group]] in [[European Theater of Operations|Europe]] during World War II.<ref name="Alex127">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=127}}</ref>

From south to northeast, the North Korean units positioned opposite the UN units were the [[83d Motorized Regiment (North Korea)|83rd Motorized Regiment]] of the [[105th Armored Division (North Korea)|105th Armored Division]] and then the [[6th Division (North Korea)|6th]],<ref name="Apple253"/> [[4th Division (North Korea)|4th]], [[3rd Division (North Korea)|3rd]], [[2nd Division (North Korea)|2nd]], [[15th Division (North Korea)|15th]],<ref name="Apple254">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=254}}</ref> [[1st Division (North Korea)|1st]], [[13th Division (North Korea)|13th]], [[8th Division (North Korea)|8th]], [[12th Division (North Korea)|12th]], and [[5th Division (North Korea)|5th]] Divisions and the [[766th Independent Infantry Regiment (North Korea)|766th Independent Infantry Regiment]].<ref name="Apple255"/>

Throughout September 1950 as the battle raged, more UN forces arrived from the US and other locations.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=133}}</ref> The [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], [[5th Regimental Combat Team]],<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=257}}</ref> and [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] and a [[British Army]] brigade arrived in Pusan later in the fighting, along with large numbers of fresh troops and equipment, including over 500 tanks.<ref name="Stewart226"/><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=258}}</ref> By the end of the battle, Eighth Army's force had gone from three under-strength divisions to four fully-manned formations which were well equipped and well prepared for war.

==Battle==
===Defensive position===
[[File:Pusan Perimeter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Pusan Perimeter, August 1950.]]
On August 1, the Eighth Army issued an operational directive to all UN ground forces in Korea for their planned withdrawal east of the Naktong River.<ref name="Apple250">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=250}}</ref> UN units would then establish main defensive positions behind what was to be called the Pusan Perimeter. The intent was to draw the line on retreating and hold off the Korean People's Army while the U.S. Army could build up its forces and launch a counteroffensive.<ref name="Apple248">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=248}}</ref> The Perimeter was the last stand for the UN forces who had seen successive defeats during the first month of the war; any further retreats would cost the Eighth Army extreme casualties.<ref name="Fehr110">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=110}}</ref> The US 25th Infantry Division held the southernmost flank at Masan,<ref name="Apple248"/> While the 24th Infantry Division withdrew to Koch'ang.<ref name="Apple249">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=249}}</ref> The 1st Cavalry Division withdrew to [[Waegwan]].<ref name="Apple251">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=251}}</ref> US forces demolished all bridges over the Naktong River in the retreat.<ref name="Apple250"/> At one bridge in the 1st Cavalry Division sector, the division commander attempted several times to clear refugees from the bridge but they continued to cross it despite warnings and several attempts to clear the bridge. Eventually the commander was forced to demolish the bridge, taking several hundred refugees with it.<ref name="Apple251"/>

Central to the UN defensive plan was to hold the port of Pusan, where vital ground supplies and reinforcements were arriving from Japan and the US.<ref name="Fehr108"/> Pusan held vital airfields where US combat and cargo aircraft were streaming into Korea with more supplies.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=259}}</ref> However, the airlifts subsided as more ground transportation became available in Pusan thanks to heavy duty [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s capable of lifting heavy weapons, which were installed in Pusan. A system similar to the [[Red Ball Express]] in [[World War II]] was employed at getting supplies from Pusan to the front lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=260}}</ref> Hundreds of ships arrived in Pusan each month starting at 230 in July and increasing steadily.<ref name="Alex134"/> On July 24, the UN established its highest command under [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=261}}</ref> North Korean forces in the meantime were suffering from overextended supply lines which severely reduced their fighting capacity.<ref>{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=12}}</ref>

North Korean forces had four possible routes in the perimeter. To the south, the pass through the city of Masan around the confluence of the Nam and Naktong rivers, through the Naktong Bulge and into the railroad lines at Miryang, through the route into Taegu in the north and through Kongju in the east corridor.<ref name="Fehrenbach 2001 120">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=120}}</ref> North Korean forces mounted a large offensive, simultaneously attacking all four entries into the perimeter in August.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=289}}</ref> As a result of this, the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was not one single engagement but a series of large battles fought between the UN and North Korean divisions all along the perimeter.<ref name="Ecker11">{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=11}}</ref>

===Counteroffensive===
Walker and the Eighth Army began preparing a [[counteroffensive]], the first conducted by the UN in the war, for August. It would kick off with an attack by the US reserve units on the Masan area to secure Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division, followed by a larger general push to the [[Kum River]] in the middle of the month.<ref name="Alex126"/><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=265}}</ref> One of his goals was to break up a suspected massing of enemy troops near the Taegu area by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On August 6, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the attack by Task Force Kean, named for the US 25th Infantry Division commander. Task Force Kean consisted of the 25th Division, less the 27th Infantry and a field artillery battalion, with the 5th Regimental Combat Team and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade attached, a force of about 20,000 men.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=267}}</ref> The plan of attack required the force to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=269}}</ref> However, the offensive relied on the arrival of the entire 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks.<ref name="Alex127"/>


[[File:24th Infantry in Korea.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men in trucks driving down a road|Troops of the 24th Infantry move to the Masan battleground]]
Task Force Kean kicked off its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=128}}</ref> At the Notch, a northern pass into the city and site of a previous battle, the [[35th Infantry Regiment (United States)|35th Infantry Regiment]] encountered 500 North Korean Infantry, defeating them. The Force surged forward to Pansong, inflicting another 350 casualties on the North Koreans. There, they overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=270}}</ref> However the rest of the Task Force was slowed by enemy resistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=271}}</ref> Task Force Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force had to rely on airstrikes and airdrops to keep it effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=272}}</ref> Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.<ref name="Fehr127"/><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=273}}</ref>

Heavy fighting continued in the area for three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=274}}</ref> The task force, aided by air power, initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=129}}</ref> On August 10 the Marines picked up the advance,<ref name="Catch24"/> inadvertently discovering the [[83rd Motorized Regiment (North Korea)|North Korean 83rd Motorized Regiment]] of the 105th Armored Division. [[F4U Corsair]]s from the [[1st Marine Air Wing]] strafed the retreating column repeatedly, inflicting 200 casualties and destroying about 100 of the regiment's equipment vehicles.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=130}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=275}}</ref> However the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade forces were withdrawn from the force on August 12 to be redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter.<ref name="Fehr127">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=127}}</ref><ref name="Appleman 1998 276">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=276}}</ref> Task Force Kean continued forward supported by naval artillery<ref name="Appleman 1998 276"/> and field artillery, capturing the area around Chondong-ni.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=277}}</ref> However, Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the [[Naktong Bulge]]<ref name="Catch25">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=25}}</ref><ref name="Appleman 1998 276"/>

[[File:M26-Pershing-west-of-masan-summer-1950.jpg|thumb|250px|US Armor advances west of Masan]]
An attempt to move the 25th Infantry Division's [[division trains]] through the valley became mired in the mud through the night of August 10<U+2013>11 and was attacked in the morning by North Koreans who had driven American forces from the high ground.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=281}}</ref> In the confusion North Korean armor was able to penetrate roadblocks and assault the supporting artillery positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=282}}</ref> The surprise attack was successful in wiping out most of the 555th and 90th Field Artillery battalions, with much of their equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=283}}</ref> Both North Korean and American armor swarmed to the scene and US Marines aviation continued to provide air cover, but neither side was able to make appreciable gains despite inflicting massive numbers of casualties on one another.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=284}}</ref> American forces were unsuccessful in retaking the positions where the artillery was overrun, suffering numerous casualties in several failed attempts to do so.<ref name="Alex131">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=131}}</ref> Upon later inspection, the bodies of 75 men, 55 from the 555th Field Artillery and 20 from the 90th Field Artillery, were found executed when the area again came under American control.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=285}}</ref> Task Force Kean was forced to withdraw back to Masan, unable to hold its gains, and by August 14 it was approximately in the same positions it had been in when it started the offensive.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=286}}</ref>

Task Force Kean had failed in its objective of diverting North Korean troops from the north, and also failed in its objective of reaching the Chinju pass, however the offensive is noted to have significantly increased morale among the troops of the 25th Infantry Division, which performed extremely well in subsequent engagements.<ref name="Alex131"/><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=287}}</ref> The 6th Division had been reduced to 3,000-4,000 and had to replenish its ranks with South Korean conscripts from Andong.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=288}}</ref> Fighting in the region continued for the rest of the month.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=132}}</ref>

{{Main|Battle of Naktong Bulge}}

About {{convert|7|mi}} north of the point where the Naktong River turns east and the Nam River enters it, the Naktong curves westward opposite Yongsan in a wide semicircular loop. For most of this span, the Naktong river is around {{convert|400|m}} wide and {{convert|6|ft}} deep, allowing infantry to wade across with some difficulty but preventing vehicles from crossing without assistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=119}}</ref> This perimeter was manned by a network of observation posts on the high ground where American forces of the 24th Infantry Division monitored the river area.<ref name="Alex135">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=135}}</ref> Forces in reserve would counterattack any attempted crossings by North Korean forces.

At midnight on the night of August 5<U+2013>6, 800 North Korean soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 16th Regiment waded across the river at the Ohang ferry site, {{convert|3.5|mi}} south of Pugong-ni and west of Yongsan, carrying light weapons and supplies over their heads or on rafts.<ref name="Gugeler30">{{harvnb|Gugeler|2005|p=30}}</ref><ref name="Apple293">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=293}}</ref> A second force attempted to cross the river further north but was hit with machine guns and artillery, falling back in confusion. At 0200 the morning of August 6, the North Koreans began engaging the forces of 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry but moved forward after a small fight, attempting to penetrate the lines to Yongsan.<ref name="Gugeler30"/> The North Korean infantry forced 3rd Battalion back, and the American battalion abandoned its command post to consolidate its positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=294}}</ref> The North Korean attack caught the Americans, who were expecting an attack from further north, by surprise.<ref name="Fehr121"/> Subsequently the North Koreans were able to capture a large amount of American equipment.<ref name="Catch25"/> The attack threatened to split the American lines and disrupt supply lines to the north.<ref name="Alex136">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=136}}</ref>

The regimental headquarters ordered the 1st Battalion to counterattack the North Koreans. Once 1st Battalion arrived at the 3rd Battalion's former command post it was ambushed by North Korean soldiers on higher ground, suffering heavy casualties in C Company, the first force there.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=295}}</ref> over half of C Company became casualties in the fight. A and B Companies counterattacked the North Korean positions with tanks and armor, eventually rescuing the beleaguered C Company.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=296}}</ref> At around 2000, A Company made contact with L Company of 3rd Battalion, still in its positions on the river, radioing that the North Koreans had penetrated eastward north of the Yongsan-Naktong River road to Cloverleaf Hill, but had not yet crossed south of the road to Obong-ni Ridge. The North Koreans had penetrated {{convert|3|mi}} east of the Naktong and halfway to Yongsan.<ref name="Apple297">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=297}}</ref>

American counterattacks continued into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather and a lack of food and water. North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area.<ref name="Fehr121">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=121}}</ref><ref name="Alex136"/> By 1600 that day, the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|US 9th Infantry Regiment]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|US 2nd Infantry Division]], a newly arrived unit, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the bulge [[salient]]. The 9th Infantry's troops were fresh, well-equipped and well-rested.<ref name="Apple299">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=299}}</ref> However, they were also inexperienced, many of their number being [[US Army Reserve|reservists]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=122}}</ref> Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.<ref name="Apple300">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=300}}</ref>

In order to effect the destruction of the North Korean bridgehead, Church assembled a large force under the 9th Infantry Regiment. Dubbed "Task Force Hill" this force comprised the 9th 19th and 34th Infantry Regiments as well as 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, as well as supporting artillery and other attached units. It was assigned to drive the North Koreans from the east bank of the river on August 11.<ref name="Apple301">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=301}}</ref> Commanding Task Force Hill was Colonel John G. Hill, the 9th Infantry Commander.<ref name="Gugeler30"/>

The NK 4th Division, in the meantime, had constructed underwater bridges of sandbags, logs and rocks, finishing the first one the day before.<ref name="Fehr121"/> It moved trucks and heavy artillery across the river through this bridge, as well as additional infantry and a few tanks.<ref name="Apple301"/><ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbah|2001|p=124}}</ref> By the morning of August 10 an estimated two North Korean regiments were now across the river and occupying fortified positions.<ref name="Gugeler30"/> Supplies continued to stream in through rafts. Task Force Hill mounted its attack, but was once again unable to make progress due to the newly established artillery.<ref name="Gugeler31">{{harvnb|Gugeler|2005|p=31}}</ref> Its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground, and by nightfall the entire NK 4th Division was across the river.<ref name="Alex136"/> On August 10 some of these units began to move south, around the American lines and outflanked Task Force Hill. The next day, scattered elements of the North Korean forces attacked Yongsan.<ref name="Apple302">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=302}}</ref> The North Korean forces repeatedly attacked US lines at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.<ref name="Catch26"/>

==== North Korean defeat ====
The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in conjunction with Task Force Hill, mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=130}}</ref> Supported by aircraft and artillery, the offensive kicked off at 0800 on August 17.<ref name="Apple312">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=312}}</ref> US Forces unleashed all they had at their disposal against the North Korean positions; artillery, mortars, airstrikes, and [[M26 Pershing]] tanks supported the Infantry and Marines.<ref name="Apple313">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=313}}</ref>

[[File:Marines carrying wounded - Pusan.jpg|thumb|left|Marines carrying a wounded comrade in a stretcher in August 1950.]]
At first tenacious North Korean defense halted the Marine's push, forcing the artillery to rake Cloverleaf Hill and force them out of their positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them one hill at a time.<ref name="Apple314">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=314}}</ref> The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but heavy resistance caused large numbers of casualties for the force, which had to withdraw after its first attack.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=132}}</ref> The NK 18th Regiment, in charge of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack following this in hopes of pushing the Marines back.<ref name="Catch26">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=26}}</ref><ref name="Fehr134"/> The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up to this point in the war, were lost in the face of massive US numerical superiority.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=139}}</ref>

By nightfall on August 18, the North Korean 4th Division had been annihilated by the US force; huge numbers of deserters had weakened its numbers during the fight, but by that time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the US forces.<ref name="Fehr134">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=134}}</ref> Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire.

===Eastern corridor===
{{mainarticle|Battle of P'ohang-dong}}
Along the South Korean front on the Eastern corridor, the terrain made moving through the area incredibly difficult. A major road ran from Taegu {{convert|50|mi}} east, to [[P<U+2019>ohang-dong]] on Korea's east coast. The only major north-south road intersecting this line moves south from [[Andong]] through [[Yongch'on]], mid way between Taegu and P'ohang-dong. The only other natural entry through the line lies at the town of An'gang-ni, {{convert|12|mi}} west of P'ohang-dong, which is situated near a valley through the natural rugged terrain to the major rail hub of [[Kyongju]], which was a staging area for moving supplies to Taegu.<ref name="Apple319"/> Walker chose not to heavily reenforce the area as he felt the terrain made meaningful attack impossible, preferring to respond to attack with reinforcements from the transportation routes and air cover from Yonil Airfield, which was south of P'ohang-dong.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=320}}</ref>

[[File:P'ohang-dong Map 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A map showing troops moving north and destroying opposing formations there |South Korean units push North Korean forces northward after intense fighting, August 11<U+2013>20.]]
==== Triple offensive ====
In early August, three North Korean divisions mounted offensives against the three passes through the area, with the NK 8th Division attacking Yongch'on, NK 12th Division attacking P<U+2019>ohang-dong and NK 5th Division, in conjunction with the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment, attacking An'gang-ni.<ref name="Apple321"/> The NK 8th Division's attack stalled almost immediately. The division drove for Yongch'on from [[Uiseong]]. However, the attack failed to reach the Taegu-P'ohang corridor after being surprised and outflanked by the ROK 8th Division. This fighting was so heavy that the NK 8th Division was forced to hold its ground a week before trying to advance. Stalled again by South Korean resistance, it was forced to halt again to wait for reinforcements.<ref name="Apple321">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=321}}</ref> However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise.<ref name="Apple319">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=319}}</ref>

East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division crossed the [[Naktong River]] at [[Andong]], moving through the mountains in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong.<ref name="Catch27"/> The division was far under strength and at least one of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them.<ref name="Apple321"/> UN planners had not anticipated the 12th Division would be able to do this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.<ref name="Fehr135">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=135}}</ref> In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division was heavily engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The divisions clashes centered around the town of [[Yongdok]], with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On August 5, the North Koreans launched their attack, again taking the town from the South Korean forces and pushing them south. At 1930 on August 6, the South Koreans launched a counteroffensive to retake the hill. US aircraft and ships pounded the town with rockets, [[napalm]] and shells before South Korean troops from the 22nd and 23rd regiments swarmed the town. However, NK 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae. This effectively surrounded the ROK 3rd Division, trapping it several miles above P'ohang-dong.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=324}}</ref> The NK 766th Independent Regiment advanced around the ROK 3rd Division and took the area around P'ohang-dong.<ref name="Apple326"/>

On August 10, the Eighth Army organized Task Force P'ohang, consisting of the ROK 17th, 25th, and 26th Regiments as well as the ROK 1st Anti-Guerrilla Battalion, Marine Battalion and a battery from the US 18th Field Artillery Battalion. The task force was given the mission to clear out North Korean forces in the mountainous region.<ref name="Apple322">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=322}}</ref> At the same time, Eighth Army formed Task Force Bradley, consisting of elements of the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|US 8th Infantry Regiment]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] under the command of Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, the 2nd Division's assistant commander.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=325}}</ref> Task Force Bradley was tasked with defending P'ohang-dong from the North Korean 766th Independent Regiment which was infiltrating the town.<ref name="Apple326">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=326}}</ref> What followed was a complicated series of fights through the large region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by US air forces engaged groups of North Korean forces operation all around the vicinity. The NK 12th Division was operating in the valley west of P'ohang-dong and was able to push back Task Force P'ohang and the ROK Capital Division. At the same time, the NK 766th Infantry Regiment and elements of the NK 5th Division fought Task Force Bradley at and south of P'ohang-dong. US naval fire was able to drive NK troops from the town, but it became a bitterly contested [[no man's land]] as fighting moved to the hills around the town.<ref name="Apple327">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=327}}</ref>

==== Fight for P'ohang-dong ====
[[File:South Koreans at Pusan.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Lines of troops marching along a road|ROK troops advance to the front lines near P'ohang-dong]]
By August 13, North Korean troops were operating in the mountains west and southwest of Yongil Airfield. US Air Force commanders, wary of enemy attack, evacuated the 45 P-51's of the [[US 39th Fighter Squadron]] and [[US 40th Fighter Squadron]] from the airstrip, against complaints of General MacArthur. However, the airstrip remained under the protection of UN ground forces and never came under direct enemy fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=329}}</ref> The squadrons were moved to [[Tsuiki]] on the island of [[Kyushu]], Japan.<ref name="Fehr136">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=136}}</ref> In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division was forced to evacuate its position after being surrounded by the NK 5th Division. The ROK division was forced further south to the village of Changsa-dong, where US Navy planners began preparations to evacuate the division by [[Landing Ship, Tank|LSTs]] and [[DUKW]]s. The division would sail {{convert|20|mi}} south to Yongil bay to join the other UN forces in a coordinated attack to push the North Koreans out of the region.<ref name="Fehr136"/><ref name="Apple330">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=330}}</ref> This evacuation was carried out on the night of August 16 under heavy support from the US Navy.<ref name="Catch27"/>

By 14 August, large forces from the NK 5th and 12th Divisions, as well was the 766th Independent Regiment were focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However they were unable to hold it because of US air superiority and naval bombardment on the town.<ref name="Apple330"/> More importantly, the supply chain had completely broken down for the division, and more food, ammunition and supplies were not available. UN forces began their final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean forces on August 15. Intense fighting around P'ohang-dong ensued for several days as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles.<ref name="Apple331">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=331}}</ref> By August 17, UN forces were able to push North Korean troops out of the Kyongju corridor and An'gang-ni, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger. The NK 766th Independent Regiment, down to 1,500 men, was forced to withdraw north to prevent being surrounded.<ref name="Apple332">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=332}}</ref> The NK 12th Division, also down to just 1,500, evacuated P'ohang-dong after this, having been exhausted from heavy casualties.<ref name="Catch27"/> The two units merged and received replacements, re-emerging as a 5,000-man NK 12th Division. By August 19 the North Korean forces had completely withdrawn from the offensive.<ref name="Fehr136"/>

===Taegu===
{{mainarticle|Battle of Taegu}}
In the meantime, Walker had established [[Taegu]] as the Eighth Army's headquarters.<ref name="Fehr135">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=135}}</ref> Right at the center of the Pusan Perimeter, Taegu stood at the entrance to the Naktong River valley, an area where North Korean forces could advance in large numbers in close support. The natural barriers provided by the Naktong River to the south and the mountainous terrain to the north converged around Taegu, which was also the major transportation hub and last major South Korean city aside from Pusan itself to remain in UN hands.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=335}}</ref> From south to north, the city was defended by the US 1st Cavalry Division, and the [[ROK 1st Division]] and [[ROK 6th Division]] of [[ROK II Corps]]. 1st Cavalry Division was spread out along a long line along the Naktong River to the south, with its [[US 5th Cavalry Regiment|5th Cavalry]] and [[US 8th Cavalry Regiment|8th Cavalry]] regiments holding a {{convert|24000|m}} line along the river and the [[US 7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] in reserve along with artillery forces, ready to reinforce anywhere a crossing could be attempted.<ref name="Apple337">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=337}}</ref>

==== Taegu advance ====
Five North Korean divisions amassed to oppose the UN at Taegu, from south to north, the [[10th Division (North Korea)|10th]],<ref name="Apple253">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=253}}</ref> [[3rd Division (North Korea)|3rd]], [[15th Division (North Korea)|15th]], [[13th Division (North Korea)|13th]],<ref name="Apple254">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=254}}</ref> [[1st Division (North Korea)|1st Division]]s occupied a line from Tuksong-dong and around [[Waegwan]] to Kunwi.<ref name="Leckie112">{{harvnb|Leckie|1996|p=112}}</ref> The North Korean army planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=336}}</ref> Elements of the [[NK 105th Armored Division]] were also supporting the attack.<ref name="Apple337"/><ref name="Catch31">{{Harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=31}}</ref>

On the night of August 4/5, the NK 13th Division began crossing the Naktong River at Naktong-ni, {{convert|40|mi}} northwest of Taegu. The crossing was not discovered until August 5 when ROK artillery and mortar fire was called on the crossing. North Korean soldiers waded across the river carrying weapons and equipment over their heads. The division's three regiments crossed on foot and by raft over the course of three nights, with the entire division across by August 7. It was several miles from the ROK 1st Division's prepared defenses.<ref name="Apple337"/> ROK troops attacked the 13th Division immediately after it completing its crossing, forcing scattered North Korean troops into the mountains. The division reassembled to the east and launched a concerted night attack, broke the ROK defenses, and began an advance that carried it twenty miles southeast of Naktong-ni on the main road to Taegu. Within a week, the NK 1st and 13th divisions were converging on the Tabu-dong area, about {{convert|15|mi}} north of Taegu.<ref name="Apple338">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=338}}</ref>

The NK 15th Division, next of the North Korean divisions in line to the south, received 1,500 replacements at [[Kumch'on]] on August 5, which brought its strength to about 6,500 men. The next day its 45th Regiment marched northeast toward the Naktong River. The regiment passed through [[Sonsan]] on August 7 and crossed the river southeast of that town, while under attack by UN aircraft. Once across the river, the regiment headed into the mountains, initially encountering no UN opposition. The other two regiments, the 48th and 50th, departed Kumch'on later and began crossing the Naktong between [[Indong]] and [[Waegwan]] before dawn of August 8, constructing underwater bridges for their vehicles. The North Koreans supported this crossing by direct tank fire from the west side of the river. These tanks evidently succeeded in crossing the river during the day. The NK 15th Division seized Hills 201 and 346 on the east side of the river at the crossing site, before advancing eastward into the mountains toward Tabu-dong, {{convert|7|mi}} away.<ref name="Apple338"/> The next day, ROK 1st Division regained the high ground at the crossing sites, forcing the North Korean forces further eastward into the mountains. From August 12-16 the three regiments of the NK 15th Division united on the east side of the Naktong River in the vicinity of Yuhak-san, {{convert|5|mi}} east of the crossing site and {{convert|3|mi}} northwest of Tabu-dong. The NK 13th Division quickly locked in combat on Yuhak-san with the ROK 1st Division.<ref name="Apple339">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=339}}</ref><ref name="Leckie113">{{harvnb|Leckie|1996|p=113}}</ref>

[[File:1st Cav at Waegwan.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large artillery gun fires as several soldiers look on|US Artillery near Waegwan fires at North Korean troops attempting to cross the Naktong River]]
==== Triangulation Hill ====
South of Waegwan, two more enemy divisions stood ready to cross the Naktong in a coordinated attack with the divisions to the north.<ref name="Apple339"/> The  experienced NK 3rd Division, concentrated in the vicinity of [[Songju]], and the untested NK 10th Division, concentrated in the [[Koryong]] area.<ref name="Alex141">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=141}}</ref> These two divisions crossed in the US 1st Cavalry Division's line. The NK 3rd Division's 7th Regiment started crossing the Naktong about 0300 9 August near Noch'on, two miles south of the Waegwan bridge.<ref name="Apple339"/> Discovering the crossing, elements of the US 5th Cavalry Regiment directed automatic weapons fire against the North Koreans and called in pre-registered artillery fire on the crossing site.<ref name="Alex141"/> Although the enemy regiment suffered some casualties, the bulk of it reached the east bank safely and moved inland into the hills. 30 minutes later, the 8th and 9th Regiments began crossing the river to the south.<ref name="Apple339"/> The 5th Cavalry Regiment and all its supporting mortars and artillery, now fully alerted, spotted and decimated the two regiments troops and turned them back to the west bank.<ref name="Alex141"/> Only a small number of North Koreans reached the east side. There, either they were captured or they hid until the next night when they recrossed the river.<ref name="Apple339"/>

At dawn on August 9, General Gay at 1st Cavalry Division headquarters in Taegu learned of the enemy crossing in his division sector south of Waegwan. As first reports were vague, he decided to withhold action until he learned more about the situation.<ref name="Apple340"/> He quickly learned that around 750 North Korean infantry had gathered on Hill 268, also known as Triangulation hill, which was {{convert|3|mi}} southeast of Waegwan and {{convert|10|mi}} northwest of Taegu.<ref name="Alex142">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=142}}</ref> Gay ordered his division to counterattack the enemy gathering to force them across the river. He and Walker believed the attack could be a feint and the North Koreans could be planning a larger attack to the north. Moreover, the hill was important for its proximity to lines of communication. The main Korean north-south highway and the main double-track Seoul-Pusan railroad skirted its base.<ref name="Apple340">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=340}}</ref>

At 1200 the artillery fired a preparation on Hill 268, and the 1st Battalion then attacked it under orders to continue on southwest to Hill 154. Hill 268 was covered with thick brush {{convert|4|ft}} and trees eight to {{convert|10|ft}} high. The North Koreans repulsed the attack. The next morning, August 10, [[air strike]]s and artillery preparations rocked Hill 268, devastating the North Korean battalion. Trapped between the two fires they started to vacate their positions. An American infantry attack then reached the top of the hill without trouble and the battle was over by 1600. American artillery and mortar fire now shifted westward and cut off the North Korean retreat. [[White phosphorus]] shells fired from the 61st Field Artillery Battalion caught North Koreans in a village as they attempted to retreat, and they were routed by American infantry, suffering over 200 killed. That evening the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, reverted to division reserve, and elements of the 5th Cavalry finished securing Hill 268.<ref name="Apple341">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=341}}</ref> An estimated 300 survivors retreated across the river the night of August 10/11.<ref name="Alex142"/> The NK 3d Division's attempted crossing of the Naktong south of Waegwan had ended in catastrophe. When the survivors of the 7th Regiment rejoined the division on or about 12 August, the once powerful 3d Division was reduced to a disorganized unit of some 2,500 men. The North Korean Army placed the division in reserve to be rebuilt by replacements.<ref name="Alex142"/><ref name="Apple342">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=342}}</ref>

==== Yongp'o ====
The North Korean plan for the attack against Taegu from the west and southwest demanded the NK 10th Division make a coordinated attack with the NK 3rd Division. The division was ordered to cross the Naktong River in the vicinity of Tuksong-dong, penetrate east, and cut the UN forces' main supply route from Pusan to Taegu. The division assembled in the Koryong area on 11 August.<ref name="Apple342"/> Further north, the 25th Regiment started crossing the Naktong at about 0300 on August 12, in the vicinity of Tuksong-dong, on the Koryong-Taegu road. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, covered this crossing site, which was {{convert|14|mi}} southwest of Taegu. By daylight, a North Korean force of 300 to 400 had penetrated to Wich'on-dong and 2nd Battalion's H Company engaged it in close combat. In a grenade and automatic weapons attack, the North Koreans overran the advance positions of the company, the mortar observation post, and the heavy machine gun positions. The North Koreans were apparently attempting to control high ground east of Yongp'o in order to provide protection for the main crossing that was to follow.<ref name="Apple343">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=343}}</ref> By 0900, however, the 2nd Battalion, supported by the 77th Field Artillery Battalion and air strikes, drove the North Koreans troops back through Yongp'o and dispersed them.<ref name="Alex142"/>

In the three days from August 10 to 12 the Naktong River had dropped three feet and was only shoulder-deep at many places due to lack of rains. This made any attempt at crossing the river considerably easier.<ref name="Apple343"/><ref name="Catch31"/> A more determined North Korean crossing of the Naktong in the vicinity of the blown bridge between Tuksong-dong and Yongp'o began early in the morning on August 14.<ref name="Alex142"/> North Korean artillery and tank fire from the west side of the river supporting the infantry crossing. A large number of North Korean reinforcements were crossing in barges near the bridge, while under fire from American air strikes and artillery. This attack also stalled, with the deepest North Korean penetration reaching Samuni-dong, {{convert|1.5|mi}} beyond the blown bridge. There the combined fire of US light weapons, mortars, and artillery drove them back to the river.<ref name="Leckie113"/> By 1200, large groups of North Koreans were trying to recross the river to the west side as American artillery continued hammering them, causing heavy casualties.<ref name="Apple344">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=344}}</ref>By nightfall, the 7th Cavalry Regiment had eliminated the North Korean [[bridgehead]] at Yongp'o.<ref name="Apple344"/> The 7th Cavalry Regiment estimated that of 1,700 North Korean troops who had succeeded in crossing the river, 1,500 were killed.<ref name="Apple345"/> In its first combat mission, the crossing of the Naktong the 10th Division suffered 2,500 casualties.<ref name="Alex142"/><ref name="Apple345">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=345}}</ref>

==== Carpet bombing ====
In the mountains northeast of Waegwan and Hill 303, the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer North Korean attacks throughout mid-August. North Korean pressure against the ROK division never ceased for long. Under the command of Brigadier General [[Paik Sun Yup]],<ref name=paik28>{{harvnb|Paik|1992|p=28}}</ref> this division fought an extremely bloody defense of the mountain approaches to Taegu.<ref name="Apple351">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=351}}</ref> US planners believed the main North Korean attack would come from west, and so it massed its forces to the west of Taegu. It mistakenly believed up to 40,000 North Korean troops were near Taegu. This number was above the actual troops numbers for North Korea, which had only 70,000 men along the entire perimeter.<ref name="Alex142"/>

On August 14, General MacArthur ordered [[Lieutenant General (US)|Lieutenant General]] [[George E. Stratemeyer]] to conduct a [[carpet bombing]] of a 27-square-mile rectangular area on the west side of the Naktong River opposite the ROK 1st Division.<ref name="Alex142"/> Intelligence estimates placed the greatest concentrations of enemy troops in this area, some estimates being as high as four enemy divisions and several armored regiments, all of 40,000 men, who were reportedly using the area to stage their attack on Taegu.<ref name="Apple352">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=352}}</ref> Stratemeyer did not think his aircraft could successfully carpet bomb an area larger than {{convert|3|mi}} square but he complied with MacArthur's order anyway.<ref name="Alex143"/> At 1158, 16 August, bombers from 10,000 feet dropped approximately 960 tons of 500- and 1,000-pound bombs on the area.<ref name="Fehr137">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=137}}</ref><ref name="Apple352"/> The attack had required the entirety of the FEAF bombing component, and they had dropped 3,084 {{convert|500|lb}} bombs and 150 {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs.

General Walker reported to General MacArthur the next day that the damage done to the North Koreans by the bombing couldn't be evaluated because of smoke and dust, and ground forces couldn't reach it because of North Korean fire.<ref name="Apple352"/> Information obtained later from North Korean prisoners revealed the enemy divisions the Far East Command thought to be still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and were not in the bombed area.<ref name="Apple353"/> No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier.<ref name="Alex143"/> However, the bombing seems to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries.

===Troop reinforcements===
Even though the North Korean People<U+2019>s Army had seriously threatened the United States and ROK Armies within the Pusan Perimeter during August 1950, the defenders successfully resisted the enemy attacks and continued the buildup of forces for a counteroffensive. The Far East Air Force had established air supremacy early in the war and continued to influence the outcome of battles by multiple sorties in close support of ground troops, 4,635 in July and 7,397 in August. By late August, there were more than 500 American medium tanks within the Pusan Perimeter. The tanks in tank battalions were equally divided between [[M26 Pershing]]s and [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Shermans]], except for one battalion that had the newer [[M46 Patton]]s. On September 1, the United Nations Command had a strength of 180,000 in Korea: 92,000 were South Koreans and the balance were Americans and the 1,600-man [[British 27th Infantry Brigade]]. In August, the North Koreans continued the plan and tactics begun at the Han River in early July with a frontal holding attack, envelopment of the flank, and infiltration to the rear. When the Eighth Army stabilized the line at the Pusan Perimeter, these tactics no longer worked and success could come only by frontal attack, penetration, and immediate exploitation. Generals MacArthur and Walker countered by utilizing their advantages: interior lines of communications, superior artillery firepower, and a strong air force. By September 1, the North Koreans had assembled a 98,000-man army for a massive offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. However, they experienced substantial problems since one-third of their ranks were composed of forcibly conscripted and untrained South Koreans, and they had a major shortage of small arms and only enough rations for one or sometimes two meals per day.

===September 1950===
[[File:Naktong Defense.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Naktong Defensive line, September 1950.]]

In early September as during August, General Walker faced dangerous situations in essentially the same places along the Pusan Perimeter: in the east at P<U+2019>ohang-dong, with the threat of a potential severing of the corridor between Taegu and P<U+2019>ohang-dong, north of Taegu where the enemy had made disturbing gains, at the Naktong Bulge, and in the Masan area in the extreme south. Also, as he had during the fighting in August, Walker continued his masterful tactics of shifting his forces from one threatened enemy penetration to another. In early September, the ROK 3rd, Capital, 8th, and 6th Divisions held the line farthest to the east against the North Korean 5th, 8th, 12th, and 15th Divisions. Maj. Gen. [[John B. Coulter]], newly appointed deputy commander, Eighth Army, assumed command of American units in the eastern sector and employed the 21st Infantry of the U.S. 24th Division and other supporting units to bolster the ROK divisions. On September 7, General Church replaced Coulter as American commander in the eastern sector after General Walker ordered the entire 24th to reinforce the ROK divisions. A combination of ground fighting, predominantly by the South Koreans, along with American close air support and naval gunfire from offshore inflicted serious losses on the North Korean divisions. The North Korean 1st, 3rd, and 13th Divisions pressed the attack north of Taegu against the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, which prompted Walker on September 5 to move the main Eighth Army headquarters from Taegu to Pusan. The 1st Cavalry Division essentially checked the thrusts of the North Koreans north of Taegu, but fighting continued there into mid-September.

At the end of August, the North Korean People<U+2019>s Army also planned a crushing blow against the U.S. 2nd and 25th Divisions in the southern part of the Pusan Perimeter. The North Korean 6th Division would attack through [[Haman]], [[Masan]], and capture [[Kimhae]], fifteen miles (24&nbsp;km) west of Pusan. The 7th Division was to strike north of the Masan highway, wheel left to the Naktong River, and wait for the 6th Division on its right and the [[9th Division (North Korea)|9th]] on its left and then resume the attack toward Pusan. The 25th Division held the southernmost sector that ran from the confluence of the Naktong and Nam Rivers to the southern coast, while the 2nd Division was positioned in the area across the Naktong River north of the 25th. The North Korean 9th Division faced the 2nd Division at the Naktong Bulge and had the mission of capturing the towns of [[Miryang]] and [[Samnangjin]], thereby cutting off the Eighth Army route of withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan. During the first week of September, the 9th Division penetrated the Naktong Bulge as far east as Yongsan, but a counterattack by the 2nd Division together with the U.S. 1st Provisional Marine Brigade pushed back the 9th almost to the Naktong River. The 2nd Division<U+2019>s 23d Infantry beat back the North Korean 2nd Division six miles (10&nbsp;km) north of Yongsan at Changnyong. At the same time, the 6th and [[7th Division (North Korea)|7th]] Divisions mounted strong attacks against the 25th Division. Despite enemy penetrations into the sectors of the 25th<U+2019>s regiments<U+2014>the 35th Infantry<U+2019>s sector west of Ch<U+2019>irwon and the 24th Infantry<U+2019>s sector near Haman that was effectively stopped by the 27th Infantry<U+2014>the 25th Division repelled the NKPA<U+2019>s offensive in the south. The Naktong River line held, and the Pusan Perimeter was secured.

==Aftermath==

Within the space of a few months in 1950, the United States had taken the big leap from attaching no strategic importance to Korea to active involvement there in a major armed conflict. Its army of 591,000 had been focused on the Soviet threat in [[Western Europe]] and occupation duty in [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]]. The four divisions under MacArthur<U+2019>s Far East Command in Japan were performing primarily occupation duties, and their actual readiness level for conventional combat was even lower than their marginal statistical ratings indicated. Each of MacArthur<U+2019>s divisions was about 7,000 men short of its authorized strength of 18,900, and none of them had received any new equipment since World War II. MacArthur had not fully supported development of the ROK Army, and in 1948 he had suggested merely expanding the ROK Constabulary. When the ROK minister of defense in 1949 requested M26 Pershing tanks from America, the [[Korean Military Advisory Group|KMAG]] argued that the Korean terrain and roads would not allow tank operations, a clearly inaccurate prediction of the Soviet T34 tank<U+2019>s performance in South Korea during the war<U+2019>s early stages. When USAFIK withdrew from South Korea in 1949, it did transfer to the ROK Army individual weapons and equipment sufficient for 50,000 men, but these small arms were incapable of repelling enemy armored attacks.

The United States failed to anticipate the North Korean invasion, and KMAG erred in concluding that the ROK Army could withstand an invasion if it happened. Nevertheless, when the attack came, the United States decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea. President Truman authorized air and naval support early in the conflict and the progressive introduction of ground troops. The [[Battle of Osan|defeat of Task Force Smith]] underscored the importance of adequate prewar training along with armored and air support in combat operations.

MacArthur underestimated the skill and determination of the North Koreans but recognized his error when he concluded that more than four U.S. divisions were needed to defeat the enemy. The combined efforts of the U.S. and ROK armies led by General Walker, supplemented by air and naval superiority, slowed the southward drive of the North Koreans and ended in a difficult but successful defense of the Pusan Perimeter. The fighting was intense, as reflected in American casualties to mid-September 1950<U+2014>4,599 battle deaths, 12,058 wounded, 401 reported captured, and 2,107 reported missing in action. North Korean losses were also high in both men and tanks, and one photograph even shows US marines walking past destroyed North Korean [[T-34]]'s, with a dead North Korean soldier lying on top of one of them. The bitter weeks of retreat and death would soon change, however, with MacArthur<U+2019>s "[[hammer against the anvil]]": the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter coupled with the [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Inch<U+2019>on]] by the 1st Marine Division and the Army<U+2019>s 7th Infantry Division during the third week of September.<ref>{{cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/KW-Outbreak/outbreak.htm | title = Korean War: The Outbreak|  first = William J.| last = Webb| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]|id = 19-6}} </ref>
