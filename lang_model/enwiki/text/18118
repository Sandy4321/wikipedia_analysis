The '''2007 Navy vs. North Texas football game''' was a regular-season [[college football]] game between the [[2007 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy Midshipmen]] and the [[2007 North Texas Mean Green football team|North Texas Mean Green]], played on November 10, 2007 at [[Fouts Field]] in [[Denton, Texas]]. The game (which the Midshipmen won 74<U+2013>62) holds the record for the most combined points scored in a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Bowl_Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) regulation game.

The mid-season, non-conference game was the first meeting between the two teams; both came into the game with highly rated offenses and poorly rated defenses. Before the game the Midshipmen had a 5<U+2013>4 record, most recently defeating the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] to break a streak of 43 consecutive losses to that team. Another win would qualify them for a [[bowl game]]. The Mean Green held a 1<U+2013>7 record, and could not become [[Bowl eligibility|bowl eligible]] by winning its remaining games, but the team's offense had improved over the course of the season.

During the first quarter of the game, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen by as much as 18 points. In the second quarter the teams combined to score 68 points, setting records for most points scored in a quarter and a half. The Midshipmen rallied around a strong [[Rush_(football)#Offense|rushing offense]] to take the lead at the beginning of the third quarter, and the Mean Green's offensive momentum sputtered during the second half. Navy held the lead for the remainder of the game.

With the win the Midshipmen improved to 6<U+2013>4, making the team bowl-eligible for the fifth straight year. After finishing the regular season with a record of 8<U+2013>4 they played in the [[2007 Poinsettia Bowl]], losing to the [[2007 Utah Utes football team|Utah Utes]]. The loss against Navy gave the Mean Green a 1<U+2013>8 record, and the team eventually finished with a 2<U+2013>10 record for the season.

===Navy===
{{see also|2007 Navy Midshipmen football team}}
The Midshipmen, using a [[triple option]] offensive scheme under head coach [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]], had gained the most rushing yards of any team in the nation and had a record of 4<U+2013>4 through the first eight games of the season. In their [[2007 Navy vs. Notre Dame football game|ninth&nbsp;game]] the team defeated the [[2007 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in [[overtime (sports)|triple overtime]], ending a 43-year losing streak in the [[Notre Dame-Navy rivalry|Notre Dame<U+2013>Navy rivalry]] and improving the team's record to 5<U+2013>4. With three&nbsp;games remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least one more to become bowl eligible. Sponsors had arranged for Navy (which was unaffiliated with any college football conference) to play in the [[Poinsettia Bowl]] if they won six games.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.sandiego.gov/qualcomm/pdf/pr070411a.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bowl Eligible Navy to Play in 2007 SDCCU Poinsettia Bowl |work=PoinsettiaBowl.net |publisher=San Diego County Credit Union |date=2007-03-04 |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> The Midshipmen defense allowed an average of 38.8 points per game.<ref name="game day" />
===North Texas===
{{see also|2007 North Texas Mean Green football team}}
Using a [[spread offense]] scheme implemented by first-year head coach [[Todd Dodge]], the Mean Green experienced some offensive success; however, defensive woes led to a 1<U+2013>7 record through the first eight games of the season. In a [[Safeway Bowl|rivalry game]] against the [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU Mustangs]] on September 8 Mean Green [[quarterback]] Daniel Meager threw for over 600 yards (one of the top 20 single-game performances in FBS history),{{sfn|NCAA|2011|p=23}} but defensive errors and an interception returned for a [[touchdown]] during the fourth quarter led to another loss.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2007-09-08 |publisher=Associated Press |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores107/107251/NCAAF763493.htm |title=Willis throws for 353 as SMU beats North Texas |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> After losing to the [[2007 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas Razorbacks]] 66<U+2013>7, Dodge replaced Meager with [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] freshman Giovanni Vizza.<ref name="match-ups">{{cite web |title=Key Match-ups for Navy at North Texas |url=http://navy.scout.com/2/699747.html |publisher=GoMids.com |last=Rohe |first=Chris |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080512202325/http://navy.scout.com/2/699747.html |archivedate=2008-05-12}}</ref> After four games as a starter, Vizza had set a new passing record for freshmen at North Texas.<ref name="insider">{{cite web |url=http://northtexas.scout.com/2/699876.html |title=Mean Green Set to Take on the Midshipmen |last=Gomez |first=Joel |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080720012628/http://northtexas.scout.com/2/699876.html |archivedate=2008-07-20}}</ref> Coming into the game, the Mean Green ranked 12th nationally in passing offense.

===First quarter===
Although the Mean Green had not scored on its first possession in its the previous eight games,<ref name="insider" /> the team scored on its opening drive against the Midshipmen when [[wide receiver]] Casey Fitzgerald caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza. The Mean Green recovered an [[onside kick]] on the ensuing kickoff and scored another touchdown on the following drive. After the Midshipmen kicked a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] on their first possession, North Texas added another touchdown, giving them a 21<U+2013>3 lead. Navy scored a touchdown with seven seconds remaining in the quarter. The period ended with the Mean Green ahead, 21<U+2013>10.<ref name="ESPN play-by-play">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=273140249&period=0 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110622114240/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=273140249&period=0 |archivedate=2011-06-22 |deadurl=no |title=Navy 74, N.

===Second quarter===
After Navy forced North Texas to begin the second quarter with a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]], Midshipmen [[running back]] Eric Kettani fumbled the ball on the second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight possessions <U+2013> four from each team <U+2013> resulted in touchdowns. Four of the drives took less than a minute of game time to reach the [[end zone]], and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At the end of the first half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49<U+2013>45.<ref name="ESPN play-by-play"/>
===Third quarter===
Navy began the third quarter with a 9-play, 60-yard touchdown drive composed completely of runs. This gave them their first lead of the game at 51<U+2013>49 (the [[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point]] attempt was blocked). On the next North Texas drive, Midshipmen [[Linebacker#Outside_linebacker|outside linebacker]] Ram Vela intercepted Giovanni Vizza's pass at the Midshipmen 20-yard line. Three plays later, Navy running back Zerbin Singleton ran 65 yards for another touchdown, making the score 58<U+2013>49. The Mean Green responded with a 7-play, 59-yard drive, which ended with another Vizza touchdown pass to Casey Fitzgerald. On the next [[play from scrimmage]], Kettani ran 49 yards. Two plays later he ran for another touchdown, bringing the score to 65<U+2013>56 at the end of the third quarter.<ref name="ESPN play-by-play"/>
===Fourth quarter===
The next Mean Green drive ended in another interception, this time by Midshipmen linebacker Matt Wimsatt. After the ensuing drive stalled at midfield, the Midshipmen downed a punt at the North Texas two-yard line. Two plays later the Mean Green were called for holding in the end zone, giving Navy a [[Safety (American and Canadian football score)|safety]]. Campbell returned the ensuing [[Safety_kick#Resuming_play_after_a_safety|free kick]] for a touchdown, giving the Midshipmen a 74<U+2013>56 lead. Running back Micah Mosley scored another touchdown for the Mean Green, but their [[two-point conversion]] attempt failed, leaving them down 74<U+2013>62. The Mean Green attempted another onside kick, but Navy recovered. One first down was enough to enable the Midshipmen to run out the clock for the win.<ref name="ESPN play-by-play"/>
