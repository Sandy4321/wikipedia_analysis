'''''Rumble Fighter''''' (also referred to as '''''RF''''') is a [[List of freeware games|free-of-charge]], [[3-D]], [[online]] [[fighting game]] developed by [[Gretech]] and [[Nimonix]], and published by [[OGPlanet]]. The game is a translated port of an original game called "''[[Gem Fighter]]''" ("<U+C82C><U+D30C><U+C774><U+D130>" in Korean -- literally "Gem Fighter"), which originated from Korea. As of now, ''Rumble Fighter'' is only open to users residing in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ogplanet.com/board/mboard.asp?exec=view&strBoardID=ogp_notice&intPage=3&intCategory=2&strSearchWord=&intSeq=284&strSkin=RF_NOTICE&strSkinGroup=Board |title=OGPlanet News Posting |accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> As Rumble Fighter progresses in development, new additions may be implemented in the game.


''Rumble Fighter'' is a [[Casual game|casual]] [[Fighting games|fighting]] [[MMOG]] in which players may battle with each other, or as teams, simultaneously. The game allows players to choose between several [[Martial arts|fighting styles]] which are known as "Sacred Scrolls". With its "ExoCore" system, players are able to undergo transformations during a battle. Such transformations change both the player's appearance, as well as their [[Martial arts|fighting abilities]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.filefront.com/gaming-today-qa-jack-liu-of-rumble-fighter/|title=Gaming Today Q&A|accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> 

Additionally, players are given the option to change their character's appearance by purchasing items using one of two [[currencies]]: "Astros" or "Carats." Although the game is free to play, users are able to buy Astros, OGPlanet's universal online [[currency]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.filefront.com/gaming-today-qa-jack-liu-of-rumble-fighter/|title=Gaming Today Q&A|accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> which may be used to purchase in-game items normally unavailable by other means.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.filefront.com/gaming-today-qa-jack-liu-of-rumble-fighter/|title=Gaming Today Q&A|accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> Other items may be purchased with Carats, the currency exclusively used in ''Rumble Fighter'', which are usually obtained by winning battles. Players may also buy clothing or accessories for their characters from the item shop, which, upon equipping, may affect their [[Statistic (role-playing games)|stats]], such as [[Hit points|HP]], [[Magic points|SP]], strength, armor, speed, and jumping capabilities.


==Gameplay==
Upon logging in, players will automatically enter a channel. Currently, 6 channels exist in the game, each generally separating players by their skill level: "Beginner," "Amateur," "Semi-Pro," "Professional," "Open," and "Tournament." Players may be promoted or demoted to different channels based on their performance in battles. The Open channel, however, is available to all players, and the Tournament channel is opened only on certain occasions. 

In the Beginner channel, it is a place where all new players start in. Once you've proven to be strong enough, you will move up a channel. Also once a player finishes a tutorial, they will be given some items and costumes to use. Players may also receive cash items from other players. 
The Amateur channel is the next step from beginner, this channel welcomes all players to Rumble Mode, such as Caged Beasts, Moving screen, and more. After continuing to prove yourself, players will be moved into the semi-pro channel. In that channel, the level of competitiveness will rise and higher levels will be around. The proffessional channel is the upper tier of the Rumble fighter tournament, this channel is only for the best players in the game. In the open channel, any players may choose to join at any time showcasing everything that Rumble fighter has to offer. If players are looking for the broadest range of competition outside of their channel, this is the place to be. 

On the bottom of the screen there are four buttons. The item shop, My character, the buddy list, and a gift list. In the item shop, there are different variety of fighting styles, ExoCores, clothing, and accessories, which, upon equipping, may effect their playing abilities. Players may choose to spend their carats wisely in the item shop. In My character, all of the players fighting styles, ExoCores, clothing, and accessories are stored there. Players are then able to change their appearance, or fighting abilities.

===Character Classes===
Rumble Fighter features four unique [[character classes]], each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Depending on the character class a player chooses, he/she will have access to different options of Clothing, Sacred Scrolls, or ExoCores with which to equip their character with. A player initially chooses one character class to start playing as, but may purchase additional classes through the use of in-game credits, Carats. Another note about character classes in Rumble Fighter is that [[gender]] plays a slight role, as it affects the stats a character has, although the difference is minimal. Currently there are four character classes in Rumble Fighter

[[Image:RF_Striker1.gif|thumb|105px|left|Striker]]<U+200E> 
====Striker====
The basic martial arts specialist, Strikers are strong in physical strength and close combat. This balance makes them ideal for beginners. When using overdrive mode equipment, their close combat skills are even further heightened. Strikers possess the top base HP and Strength out of the available classes.

[[Image:SoulFighter1.gif|thumb|105px|right|Soul Fighter]]
====Soul Fighter====
Soul Fighters are aptly named because they have the ability to call upon other living souls for power. Strong in speed and jump, but weak in defense, their winning strategy is to hit-and-run, making them better for experienced users. With their overdrive mode equipment, they can morph into beasts or take on other forms. Soul Fighters possess the highest base Speed and Jump out of the four classes.

[[Image:RF_Elementalist1.gif|thumb|105px|left|Elementalist]]
====Elementalist====
Elementalists have strong psychic powers which makes their special skill attacks quite powerful, while their offense and defense abilities are weak. Their winning strategy is fighting with their special skills from distance. Their overdrive mode equipment can summon various elemental spirits into battle. Elementalist possess the top base SP out of the four classes, but also have the lowest base stats in HP, Armor and Strength.

[[Image:RF_Alchemist1.gif|thumb|105px|right|Alchemist]]

====Alchemist====
Skilled in the arts of elemental transmutation, Alchemists have gear which offer great defense, but with speed being their obvious drawback. So their winning strategy always involves defense first, then strong attacks with their special skills second. Their overdrive equipment can make huge armor or mechs. Alchemists possess the highest base Armor out of the four classes, but also the lowest base Speed and Jump.

===Game Modes===
In each channel, a list of rooms is provided. Each room may hold up to 8 people. The objective and conditions to win a battle are dependent on the game mode and settings that the room creator has set. 

[[Image:TypicalFightRumbleFighter.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A typical 1-on-1 match in Battle Mode]]
====Battle Mode====
As an individual or a team, players are given two minutes to fight with one another. Points are awarded at the end of each round, and are predominately based on one's performance in battle. The team or player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

====Rumble Mode====

Unlike Battle Mode, which primarily focuses on fighting, Rumble Mode adds several dynamics to gameplay. 

*'''Arena'''

Players are provided with a rather confined area in which to fight, and are given an unlimited amount of lives. In this mode, the objective is to defeat the most opponents within the time limit. Once a character is defeated, they will automatically [[Spawning (computer gaming)|respawn]] elsewhere in the area. This continues until the time limit is reached.

[[Image:Typical Caged Beast.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical 4-on-4 teamed match set in Caged Beast]]

*'''Caged Beast'''

The round begins by having two opposing players placed in the center of the arena. All other players are left in cages, watching the fight between these two players. When one of the players fighting in the initial 1-on-1 is defeated, a player on their team is released from the cage, replacing their teammate's position in battle. This continues until the time limit reaches 60 seconds, at which point all remaining cages are broken, thus setting all players free and beginning a battle in which all remaining players are involved. 

*'''King of the Hill'''

This mode may be played in teams, or as a [[Deathmatch (gaming)|free-for-all]]. All players are given 2 minutes to reach the top of a given hill, trying to stay on its peak for as long as possible. At set intervals, a flag is awarded to the current player on top of the hill. Once a player is in possession of three flags, the three icons are then replaced with a larger flag. The first team or individual that has four of such sized flags is declared the winner.

[[Image:Demolition.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A typical 8 player match set in Moving Screen]]
*'''Moving Screen'''

Unlike Battle Mode, the arenas offered in Moving Screen are continuously moving in a single direction. If a player cannot keep up, they will fall off the screen, consequently resulting in defeat. Opposing players may knock others off the arena using various combative techniques. Once the time limit reaches a certain point, the arena will cease to move, leaving players to fight within the remaining time. 

[[Image:Potion battle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical 1v1 match set in Potion Battle]]
*'''Potion Battle'''

This mode may be played in teams, or as a free-for-all. Principally, the objective is to fend opposing players from a blue bottle, while consuming its contents. When a bottle [[Spawning (computer gaming)|spawns]] in an arena, an arrow appears to indicate the bottle's position relative to the player. Once a player reaches the bottle, they may pick it up by pressing their assigned punch button, thus causing the arrow to disappear. They can then press it once more to drink it, which, during the moderate amount of time it takes to fully consume, quicker players can attempt to knock them down, causing them to loosen their grip of the potion, thus dropping it. The player who drinks the most bottles is declared the winner.

====Bonuses====
In a game involving more than two players, various bonuses may be given to players if they have fulfilled certain conditions during battle.

===ExoCores===

The "ExoCore" system allows players to transform their characters during a battle, changing their appearance, usually significantly, and often overriding a Sacred Scroll's set of combative moves. Players may hold up to two ExoCores at once, though they are limited to using one ExoCore at a time. Each ExoCore provides the player with at least one new ability they may use in combat. The limit of one active ExoCore at a time urges the need for strategic choice because of the differing abilities each ExoCore grants the player.

Although ExoCores may be purchased from the game's "Item Shop," some may be exclusive to certain [[character classes]]. As ''Rumble Fighter'' progresses in development, new ExoCores may be implemented.
