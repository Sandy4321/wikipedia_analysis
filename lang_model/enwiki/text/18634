[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Preamble of the [[Constitution of India]] <U+2014> India's fundamental and supreme law.]]
The '''Fundamental Rights''', '''Directive Principles of State Policy''' and '''Fundamental Duties''' are sections of the [[Constitution of India]], that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the State{{fn|I}} to the citizens, and the duties of the citizens with respect to the State. These sections comprise a constitutional [[bill of rights]], guidelines for government policy-making, and the behaviour and conduct of citizens. These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution, which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. 

The [[Fundamental Rights of India|''Fundamental Rights'']] are defined as the basic [[human rights]] of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, [[caste]], creed and gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. 

The [[Directive Principles of India|''Directive Principles of State Policy'']] are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions<U+2014>set out in Part IV of the Constitution<U+2014>are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing laws. 

The ''Fundamental Duties'' are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help to promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India. These duties<U+2014>set out in Part IV<U+2013>A of the constitution<U+2014>concern individuals and the nation. Like the Directive Principles, they are not legally enforceable.

== History ==
{{main|Indian independence movement|Constitution of India}}
[[Image:B.R. Ambedkar.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[B. R. Ambedkar]]: The chairman of the constitution drafting committee]]

The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as [[Bill of Rights 1689|England's Bill of Rights]], the [[United States Bill of Rights]], and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]].<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-23</ref>

In 1928, an [[Nehru Report|All Parties Conference]] of representatives from Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India. This 11-member committee, led by [[Motilal Nehru]], had been called into existence as a formal instrument to complement the widespread [[Non-Cooperation Movement|civil disobedience]] campaigns of the 1920s. These mass campaigns had originally been a response to the [[Rowlatt Act]]s, which in 1919 had given the British colonial government the powers of arrest and detention, conduction of searches and seizures without warrants, restriction of public gatherings, and censorship of the press. Demanding [[dominion]] status and elections under universal suffrage, the committee called for guarantees of rights deemed fundamental, representation for religious and ethnic minorities, and limitations on government powers. 

In 1931, the [[Indian National Congress]], at its [[Karachi]] session, adopted resolutions defining, as well as committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, including socio-economic rights such as [[minimum wage]], the abolition of [[untouchability]], and [[serfdom]].<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Committing themselves to [[socialism]] in 1936, the leaders of the Congress party took examples from the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|Soviet constitution]], which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective, patriotic responsibility.

The task of developing a constitution for an independent India was undertaken by the Constituent Assembly of India, which composed of elected representatives under the presidency of [[Rajendra Prasad]]. The assembly appointed a [[Constitution of India#History|constitution drafting committee]] headed by [[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]]. The process was influenced by the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the [[U.N. General Assembly]] on [[10 December]] [[1948]]. The declaration called upon all member States to adopt these rights in their constitutions. The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles were included in the final draft of the constitution promulgated on [[26 November]] [[1949]], while the Fundamental Duties were later added to the constitution by the [[Constitution of India#Amendments|42nd Amendment Act]] in 1976.<ref name="42amact">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend42.htm 42nd Amendment Act, 1976].</ref> Changes in Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties require a [[Constitution of India#Amendments|constitutional amendment]], that must be passed by a two-thirds majority in both houses of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].

The Fundamental Rights <U+2014> embodied in Part III of the constitution <U+2014> guarantee civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace as citizens of India. The six fundamental rights are right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and right to constitutional remedies.<ref name=constpartIII>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Fundamental Rights]].</ref>

These include individual rights common to most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], incorporated in the fundamental law of the land, and are enforceable in a court of law. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the [[Indian Penal Code]], subject to discretion of the [[judiciary]]. These rights are neither absolute nor immune from constitutional amendments. They have been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practises. Specifically, they resulted in abolishment of untouchability, and prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They forbid [[human trafficking]] and [[unfree labour]]. They protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious [[minorities]] by allowing them to preserve their languages and administer their own educational institutions.

All people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have the right to approach the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] or the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. In public interest, anyone can initiate litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as "[[Public interest litigation]]".<ref>{{cite web

{{Rights}}
The Fundamental Rights emphasise equality by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of public institutions and protections, irrespective of their background. The rights to life and personal liberty apply for persons of any nationality, while others, such as the freedom of speech and expression are applicable only to the [[Indian nationality law|citizens of India]] (including [[NRI|non-resident Indian citizens]]).<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-25</ref> The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|overseas citizens of India]].<ref name="OCI">{{cite web

Fundamental Rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary State actions, but some rights are enforceable against private individuals too.<ref>{{cite web

}} This was the case where Fundamental Rights were enforced against private individuals (date of ruling [[15 December]] [[1995]]).</ref> For instance, the constitution abolishes untouchability and prohibits ''[[Unfree labour|begar]]''. These provisions act as a check both on State action and actions of private individuals. Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of national interest. In the [[Basic structure#The Kesavananda Case of 1973|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala'' case]], the Supreme Court ruled that all provisions of the constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended.<ref>[[Basic structure#The Kesavananda Case of 1973|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala''; AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225]] &mdash; In what became famously known as the "Fundamental Rights case", the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decided that the basic structure of the constitution was unamendable.</ref> However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution, like secularism and democracy. Often called the "Basic structure doctrine", this decision is widely regarded as an important part of Indian history. In the 1978 ''[[Maneka Gandhi]] v. Union of India'' case, the Supreme Court extended the doctrine's importance as superior to any parliamentary legislation.<ref name="Maneka">{{cite web

The Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a constitutional amendment, hence their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch, but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-24</ref> The imposition of a [[State of Emergency in India|state of emergency]] may lead to a temporary suspension of the rights conferred by Article 19 (including freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) to preserve national security and public order. The President can, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well.
[[Image:Dyfikolkata (54).jpg|thumb|left|Huge rallies like this one in [[Kolkata]] are commonplace in [[India]].]]

===Personal rights===
The Right to equality is one of the chief guarantees given in Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the constitution. It is the principal foundation of all other rights, guaranteeing equality of all citizens before law, social equality, equal access to public areas, equality in matters of public employment, the abolition of untouchability and of titles.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Fundamental Rights]].</ref> However, reservations can be made for women, children, [[scheduled castes]], and [[scheduled tribes]]. 

The State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment, though exceptions can be made where specific knowledge is required. To preserve religious freedom, the holder of an office of any religious institution should be a person professing that particular religion.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 16 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> The right to equality in matters regarding public employment is not conferred to [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|overseas citizens of India]].<ref name="OCI"/> The practise of untouchability has been declared an offence punishable by law. The State cannot confer any titles, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign State. Indian aristocratic titles such as ''Rai Bahadurs'' and ''Khan Bahadurs'' have been abolished. However, military and academic distinctions can be conferred on the citizens of India. Awards such as the ''[[Bharat Ratna]]'' "cannot be used by the recipient as a title."<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:MadrasHighCourtManuNeedhiCholanStatue.jpg|thumb|150px|A statue of the legendary king [[Manuneedhi Cholan]], who stood for fairness and justice, inside the [[Madras High Court]] campus.]]
The Right to freedom is stated in Articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the constitution. The right to freedom encompasses the [[freedom of expression]], the [[freedom of assembly|freedom to assemble]] peacefully without arms, the freedom to form associations and unions, the freedom to move freely and settle in any part of the territory of India and the freedom to practise any profession.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 19 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> Restrictions can be imposed on all these rights in the interest of security, decency and morality. The constitution guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. Protection with respect to conviction for offences, protection of life and personal liberty and the rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 22 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> are laid down in the right to life and personal liberty. 

The Right to freedom of religion'<U+2014>covered in Articles 25, 26, 27 and 28<U+2014>provides [[religious freedom]] to all citizens and preserves the principle of secularism in India. According to the constitution, all religions are equal before the State. Citizens are free to preach, practise and propagate any religion of their choice.<ref name=constpartIIIart25>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 25 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> Several distinct and often controversial practises, such as the wearing and carrying of ''[[kirpan]]s'' is included in the profession of [[Sikhism]] and protected under law.<ref name=constpartIIIart25/> Religious communities can set up charitable institutions of their own, subject to certain restrictions in the interest of public order, morality and health. No person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of a religion, and a State-run institution cannot impart education that is associated with a particular religion.

===Economic and social rights===
The cultural and educational rights<U+2014>given in Articles 29 and 30<U+2014>are measures to protect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. Any community that has a language and a script of its own has the right to conserve and develop them.<ref name=constpartIIIart29>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 24 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> No citizen can be discriminated against for admission in State or State-aided institutions.<ref name=constpartIIIart29/> All religious and ethno-linguistic communities can set up their own educational institutions in order to preserve and develop their own culture.<ref name="constpartIIIart30">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 30 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> In granting aid to institutions, the State cannot discriminate against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a minority institution.<ref name="constpartIIIart30"/> The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under [[Fundamental Rights in India#Right to Freedom|right to life and personal liberty]] by the 86th constitutional amendment of 2002.<ref name="86amact">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend86.htm 86th Amendment Act, 2002].</ref>

[[Image:ChildLabor1910.png|thumb|180px|left|[[Child labour]] and [[Unfree labour|''Begar'']] is prohibited under Right against exploitation.]]
The Right against exploitation, given in Articles 23 and 24 provides for the abolition of human trafficking,<ref name="constpartIIIart23">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 23 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> and the abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories and mines.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 24 Fundamental Rights]].</ref> Child labour is considered a violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution. ''Begar'' (forced and unfree labour), practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of slave trade or prostitution is prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for services for public purposes, such as compulsory military [[conscription]].<ref name="constpartIIIart23"/>

The Right to constitutional remedies empowers the citizens to approach a [[court]] of law to appeal against denial of the Fundamental Rights. For instance, in case of imprisonment, the person can ask the court to see if it is in accordance with the provisions of the law of the country. If the court finds that it is not, the person will be released from custody. This procedure of asking the courts to preserve or safeguard the citizens' Fundamental Rights can be done in various ways. The courts can issue ''[[Writs#Indian law|writs]]'', namely ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''prohibition'', ''[[quo warranto]]'' and ''[[certiorari]]''.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 32 Fundamental Rights]].</ref>  When a national or state emergency is declared, this right is suspended by the central government.

The Right to property was a former Fundamental Right under Article 32 before it was revoked by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.<ref name="44amact">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm 44th Amendment Act, 1978].</ref> A new article, Article 300-A,<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part XII#Chapter IV Right to Property|Constitution of India-Part XII Chapter IV Finance, Property, Contracts and Suits]]</ref> was added to the constitution which provided that no person shall be deprived of his property, except by the authority of law. If a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay any compensation. The aggrieved person will have no right to move the court under Article 32. The right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law.<ref name="pgA33">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-33</ref>

== Directive Principles of State Policy ==
{{main|Directive Principles in India}}
[[Image:Mohandas Gandhi resized for biography.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Gandhism|Gandhian]] philosophy, originally propounded by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] has greatly influenced the Directive Principles.]] 
The Directive Principles of State Policy, embodied in Part IV of the constitution, are directions given to the central and state governments to guide the establishment of a just society in the country. According to the constitution, the government should keep them in mind while framing laws, even though they are [[Justiciable|non-justiciable]] in nature. Directive Principles are classified under the following categories: [[Gandhism|Gandhian]], social, economic, political, administrative, legal, environmental, protection of monuments, peace, and security.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> 

The Directive Principles act as a check on the government; theorised as a yardstick in the hands of the people to measure the performance of the government. Article 31-C,<ref name="art31C">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Article 31-C Fundamental Rights]].</ref> added by the 25th Amendment Act of 1971, seeks to upgrade the Directive Principles.<ref name="25amact">[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend25.htm 25th Amendment Act, 1971].</ref> If laws are made to give effect to the Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights, they shall not be invalid on the grounds that they take away the Fundamental Rights. In case of a conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, if the latter aim at promoting larger interest of the society, the courts will have to uphold the case in favour of Directive Principles.<ref name="art31C"/>

The Directive Principles commit the State to promote the welfare of the people by affirming social, economic and political justice, as well as to fight [[economic inequality]].<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 38 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The State must continually work towards providing an adequate means of livelihood for all citizens, equal pay for equal work for men and women, proper working conditions, protection against exploitation, and reduce the concentration of wealth and means of production from the hands of a few.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 39 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The State must provide free [[legal aid]] to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen for reason of economic or other disabilities.<ref name="art39A">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 39A Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The State should work for organisation of village [[panchayat]]s, provide the [[right to work]], [[right to education|education]] and public assistance in certain cases;<ref name="art41">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 41 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> as well as the provision of just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 42 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> A living wage and safe working conditions for citizens must be ensured, as must their participation in the management of industries. The State is obligated to secure a [[uniform civil code]] for all citizens,<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 44 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> provide free and compulsory education to children,<ref name="art45">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 45 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> and to work for the economic uplift of [[scheduled caste]]s, [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Classes|other backward classes]].

The Directive Principles commit the State to raise the standard of living and improve public health,<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 47 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> and organise agriculture, and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines. The State must safeguard the environment and wildlife of the country.<ref name="art48A">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 48A Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The State must ensure the preservation of monuments and objects of national importance, and separation of judiciary from executive in public services<ref name="art50">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 50 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The State must also strive for the maintenance of international peace.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 51 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> 

The Directive Principles have been amended to meet definite objectives. Article 45, which ensures ''Provision for free and compulsory education for children'',<ref name="art45"/> was added by the [[Constitution of India#Amendments|86th Amendment Act, 2002]].<ref name="86amact"/> Article 48-A, which ensures ''Protection of the environment and wildlife'',<ref name="art48A"/> was added by the [[Constitution of India#Amendments|42nd Amendment Act, 1976]].<ref name="42amact"/>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

== Fundamental Duties == 
The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added by the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976.<ref name="42amact"/> The ten Fundamental Duties<U+2014>given in Article 51-A of the constitution<U+2014>can be classified as either duties towards self, duties concerning the environment, duties towards the State, and duties towards the nation.<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IVA|Constitution of India-Part IVA Fundamental Duties]].</ref> The 11th Fundamental Duty, which states that every citizen "''who is a parent or guardian, to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years''" was added by the 86th constitutional amendment in 2002.<ref name="86amact"/>

Citizens are morally obligated by the constitution to perform these duties. However, these are non-justiciable, incorporated only with the purpose of promoting patriotism among citizens. These obligations extend not only to the citizens, but also to the State.<ref name="pgA35">Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', pg. A-35</ref><ref>Sinha, Savita, Das, Supta & Rashmi, Neeraja (2005), ''Social Science <U+2013> Part II'', pg. 30</ref> There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India (including the constitution), to cherish its [[History of India|heritage]], and assist in its defence. It aims to promote the equality of all individuals, protect the environment and public property, to develop "scientific temper", to abjure violence, to strive towards excellence, and to provide free and compulsory education.<ref name="art51A">[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IVA|Constitution of India-Part IVA Article 51A Fundamental Duties]].</ref>

== Criticism and analysis ==
[[Image:Flag of India.svg|200px|thumb|left|Any act of disrespect towards [[Flag of India|Indian National Flag]] is illegal.]]  
The Fundamental Rights have been criticised as inadequate in providing freedom and opportunity for all Indians. Many political groups have demanded that the [[right to work]], the right to economic assistance in case of unemployment, and similar socio-economic rights be enshrined as constitutional guarantees,<ref name="pgA33"/> that are presently listed in the [[Directive Principles in India|directive principles of state policy]].<ref>[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part IV|Constitution of India-Part IV Article 41 Directive Principles of State Policy]].</ref> The right to freedom has a number of limiting clauses, and been criticised for failing to check government powers<ref name="pgA33"/> such as provisions of preventive detention and suspension of fundamental rights in times of [[State of Emergency in India|emergency]]. The phrases "security of State", "public order" and "morality" are unclear, having wide implication. The meaning of phrases like "reasonable restrictions" and "the interest of public order" have not been explicitly stated in the constitution, leading to frequent litigations.<ref name="pgA33"/> The ''[[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]]'' (1975) was strongly criticised for giving then-Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] the authority to arrest opposition leaders following the declaration of [[Indian Emergency|emergency in 1975]]. The ''[[Prevention of Terrorism Act]]'' (2002), now repealed,<ref name=POTArepeal>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/041206/43/2ib4w.html POTA repealed, new anti-terror law passed]</ref> has been criticised as unfairly targeting the [[Muslim]] community.<ref name="pgA33"/> Initially, the Supreme Court provided extensive power to the State in its verdict to the ''A. K. Gopalan vs. state of Madras'' case in 1950. The Court held that howsoever unreasonable, a law was valid if made by a legislature competent to enact it.<ref name="Maneka">{{cite web

The implementation of a [[uniform civil code]] for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and [[List of political parties in India|political parties]]. The [[Shah Bano case]] (1985-86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that [[Shah Bano]], a Muslim woman who had been divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive [[alimony]] from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the [[All India Muslim Personal Law Board|Muslim personal law]] and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict.<ref>{{cite news

The Fundamental Duties have been criticised for being ambiguously worded, with the real meaning of phrases like "scientific temper" and "spirit of enquiry and reform" being debated. As the duties cannot be enforced through courts, their relevance to practical affairs is questioned. However, actions damaging public property and showing disrespect to the [[Flag of India|National Flag]] are offences punishable by law. Similarly, people may be called upon to defend the country by compulsorily recruitment to the armed forces of the country through [[conscription]].<ref name="art51A"/>
