'''Commander Australian Fleet''' (COMAUSTFLT) is a senior appointment in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN), holding full command of all Navy combat forces and responsibility for all maritime operations within the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF). The rank associated with the position is [[Rear Admiral (Australia)|rear admiral]] ([[2 star rank|2 star]]), and is currently occupied by Rear Admiral [[Steve Gilmore]].

==History==
Prior to 1913, all naval activities and forces in Australian waters were controlled by the British [[Royal Navy]]. In 1859, [[Australia Station]] was established as a separate command of the Royal Navy, responsible for all the waters around the Australian continent, in addition to the British and Australian colonial possessions in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. It was at this stage that the forerunner of Commander Australian Fleet, Officers Commanding Imperial Squadron Australian Station, was formed. Between the [[Federation of Australia]] and formation of the Commonwealth Naval Forces in 1901 to the year of 1913, the Royal Navy began a process of transferring all command responsibility in Australian waters over to the [[Australian Government]], as well as replacing equipment and personnel with Australian variants. The Commonwealth Naval Forces were renamed to Royal Australian Navy in 1911. With the transfer complete in 1913, the position of Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Fleet was formed, with control over all naval combat operations and forces; the post was renamed Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron in 1926. Despite this position being a command of the RAN, the majority of occupants were Royal Navy officers attached to, or on loan to, the RAN.<ref name="Personalities">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Gregory P.|title=Australian Naval Personalities: Lives From the Australian Dictionary of Biography|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/PIAMA17.pdf|year=2006|format=PDF|publisher=Sea Power Centre|location=Canberra, Australia|isbn=0 642 296367|accessdate=18 October 2009}}</ref><ref name="RANhistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/The_R.A.N._-_A_Brief_History|title=The RAN &mdash; A Brief History|accessdate=18 October 2009|work=History|publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}</ref>

In 1949, Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron was redesignated Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet.

==Previous commanders==
The following list chronologically records those who have held the post of Commander Australian Fleet or its preceeding positions. However, the position of Officers Commanding Imperial Squadron Australian Station (1859&ndash;1913) is not included in this list as it was administered as a command of the Royal Navy, and existed before the formation of the Royal Australian Navy. The official title of the commander at that period of time is listed immediately before the officers who held that role. The rank and honours are as at the completion of the commander's stint.<ref name="Personalities"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Rear_Admiral_Nigel_Coates|title=Rear Admiral Nigel Coates|accessdate=18 October 2009|publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/leaders/navy/steveGilmore/index.htm|title=Rear Admiral Steve Gilmore|accessdate=18 October 2009|work=Defence Leaders: Navy|publisher=Department of Defence}}</ref>
