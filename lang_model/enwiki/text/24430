'''Ronnie Aaron Creager''' (born January 14, 1974<ref name="Bday">{{cite web|title=Happy Birthday Ronnie!|url=http://theberrics.com/gen-ops/happy-birthday-ronnie.html|work=The Berrics|publisher=The Berrics|accessdate=14 January 2013|format=Video upload|date=14|month=January|year=2013}}</ref>) is a "[[footedness|goofy]]-footed" American professional [[skateboard]]er from [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[California]].

==Early life==
As Creager has explained in a 2011 interview, he commenced skateboarding at the age of three:

<blockquote>
My neighbor Mike Skinner introduced skateboarding to me around the age of three. He basically brainwashed me as a small child by pushing me around on his board when my mind was just developing. My first real board was a Sure-Grip that belonged to my sister, but the one I remember the most from early on was a Ken Park. I had all the plastic accessories on it<U+2014>plus Rip Grip and cut-up griptape in all different colors. But back then, the only things that mattered to me were the wheels. If I could roll, I was in business.<ref name="Chops">{{cite web|title=The Chrome Ball Incident for ABD #3: Ronnie Creager|url=http://alreadybeendone.com/content/2011/02/08/the-chrome-ball-incident-for-abd-3-ronnie-creager/|work=Already Been Done|publisher=Already Been Done|accessdate=14 January 2013|author=Chops|year=2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Creager specializes in technical street skating<ref>{{cite web|title=Blind Sunday Fundays: Ronnie Creager In The Streets - TransWorld SKATEboarding|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKC1CuNRlks|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=5 April 2013|author=TransworldSKATEmag|format=Video upload|date=1|month=May|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ronnie Creager Super Part|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkzshfvv4pk|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=5 April 2013|author=Darko Bosnjak|format=Video upload|date=29|month=April|year=2007}}</ref> and for more than twenty years his professional skateboard footage has frequently featured ledge structures (Creager produced a ledge skateboarding instructional video segment for ''[[Transworld Skateboarding|TransWorld SKATEboarding]]'' magazine in 2011<ref>{{cite web|title=HOW TO: HALF CAB NOSESLIDE 270 OUT WITH RONNIE CREAGER|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000142568/features/how-to-half-cab-noseslide-270-out-with-ronnie-creager/|work=TransWorld SKATEboarding|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=5 April 2013|author=Blair Alley|format=Video upload|date=28|month=July|year=2011}}</ref>).

Creager is a senior member of the [[Blind Skateboards]] team and stated that it felt unstable when he first joined the company:

<blockquote>
It was scary. At one point, I was the only rider on the team. I was worried. I had lost a sponsor before and knew how it felt, but this time was different: it wasn<U+2019>t about getting kicked off<U+2014>it was that the company might fall apart.<ref name="Chops" /></blockquote>

In 2011, Creager revealed that he had been with the company for almost twenty years, stating that his entire skateboarding career has been devoted to the brand: "I<U+2019>ve dedicated my whole skate career to Blind and stood behind the company in times of both good and bad but I<U+2019>m confident that Blind will take care of me."<ref name="Chops" />

Creager was sponsored by [[Tensor Trucks|Tensor]], the skateboard truck brand founded by skateboard pioneer [[Rodney Mullen]]<U+2014>Creager released signature truck models with the brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tensor Trucks - Duo Tone Series Ad (2006)|url=http://skately.com/library/ads/tensor-trucks-duo-tone-series-2006|work=Skately|publisher=Skately LLC|accessdate=14 January 2013|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tensor Trucks - Magnesium Response Mids Ad (2008)|url=http://skately.com/library/ads/tensor-trucks-magnesium-response-mids-2008|work=Skately|publisher=Skately LLC|accessdate=14 January 2013|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Creager Silver Fade|url=http://tensortrucks.com/trucks/maglight/creager-silver-fade/|work=Tensor Trucks|publisher=Tensor Trucks|accessdate=14 January 2013|month=January|year=2013}}</ref> As of September 2013, Creager is a team rider for the Theeve truck brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=THEEVE WELCOMES RONNIE CREAGER TO THE TEAM|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny5nrwYcayw|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=25 September 2013|author=Theevetrucks|format=Video upload|date=5 September 2013}}</ref>

Since 2011, Creager has become increasingly involved with [[The Berrics]] website that is owned by professional skateboarders [[Steve Berra]] and [[Eric Koston]]. In addition to being sponsored by the Berrics brand, Creager is often featured in the website's video segments<ref>{{cite web|title=FIRST TRY FRIDAYS With Mark Appleyard & Ronnie Creager|url=http://theberrics.com/first-try-fridays/with-mark-appleyard-and-ronnie-creager.html|work=The Berrics|publisher=The Berrics|accessdate=14 January 2013|format=Video upload|date=14|month=September|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BATTLE AT THE BERRICS 6 Regular Vs Goofy|url=http://theberrics.com/gen-ops/battle-at-the-berrics-6-regular-vs-goofy.html|work=The Berrics|publisher=The Berrics|accessdate=14 January 2013|format=Video upload|date=12|month=January|year=2013}}</ref> and on January 14, 2013, the website released a birthday video that featured Creager skating in the Berrics training facility.<ref name="Bday" />

As of September 2013, Creager is sponsored by Blind Skateboards, Theeve Trucks, Etcetera Project, The Berrics, OC Ramps, and Bones Wheels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Team|url=http://blindskateboards.com/team/|work=Blind|publisher=Blind Skateboards|accessdate=27 September 2012|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Team|url=http://tensortrucks.com/team/mullen/|work=Tensor Trucks|publisher=Tensor Trucks|accessdate=27 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Team|url=http://bones.com/team/|work=Bones Wheels|publisher=Skate One|accessdate=27 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to GET FREE STICKERS!

==Company owner==
Creager's first business venture involved launching a now-defunct skate shoe brand called "Nadia". However, Creager has since explained that the experience was a difficult one:

<blockquote>
[The experience with Nadia was]Both positive and negative. Living in China for months at a time in the factory was amazing. I would work on shoes and try my hand at sewing<U+2014>seeing firsthand how shoes are made. I<U+2019>d play basketball at night and help employees learn to ride a skateboard. I would go fish all the time with our friend Bernie, who owns two plastic and metal molding manufacturing companies in Guang Dong, China. We<U+2019>d catch fish for the factory and drink beer. Bernie is Cantonese and his English has gotten amazing over the years, my Mandarin, however, still sucks.

The negative side was the lies and greed that the owners had. It sucks how people change when money is involved. I lost a huge amount of money paying for materials and salaries, but that<U+2019>s the price I pay for experience.<ref name="Chops" /></blockquote>

Creager has also revealed that "I feel I<U+2019>ve only made one bad decision in my whole skate career and that was when I decided to leave <U+00E9>S [to start Nadia]. Don Brown gave me the option to stay but I couldn<U+2019>t take the pressure back then. I was naive, confused and didn<U+2019>t know what to do."<ref name="Chops" />

Creager launched a skateboard accessories brand in 2011, entitled "Etcetera". According to the brand's publicity, the company "is committed to creating and innovating
new products for skateboarding." As of September 2012, Etcetera produces the following accessories for the retail market: "Primo Insoles", "Ankle Stabiliser", "Lace Belt", and the "Wall Ride" skateboard deck-storage device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Primo Insoles|url=http://etceteraproject.com/primo/index.html|work=etcetera|publisher=The Etcetera Project|accessdate=27 September 2012|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Products|url=http://store.etceteraproject.com/home/index/12464.0|work=Etcetera Project|publisher=Shopatron, Inc. and Etcetera Project|accessdate=27 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref> Creager explained the idea behind the brand in a 2011 interview:

<blockquote>
It<U+2019>s an accessories line designed to help keep skaters on their boards instead of nursing an injury. Ankle braces you can skate in, fully padded insoles and other products that I need to keep under wraps for a just little longer. It<U+2019>s been in the works for a long time now. I just think it<U+2019>s crazy that some of these ideas skaters come up with never get made, so that<U+2019>s why we exist.<ref name="Chops" /></blockquote>

Etcetera also sponsors a team that consists of Jordan Hoffart, Manny Santiago, Ronnie Creager, Morgan Smith, [[Marc Johnson (skateboarder)|Marc Johnson]], and Chase Gabor (Johnson was added to the team in September 2012).<ref>{{cite web|title=Team|url=http://etceteraproject.com/etceterateam/index.html|work=Etcetera|publisher=Etcetera Project|accessdate=8 September 2012|author=Etcetera Project|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Aberrican Times|url=http://theberrics.com/news/marc-johnson-on-etcetera.html|work=The Berrics|publisher=The Berrics|accessdate=9 September 2012|author=General|date=9|month=September|year=2012}}</ref> Creager starred in a commercial for Etcetera, filmed at and near his home in California, US, and the production was published on the Internet in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ronnie Creager Etcetera Commercial|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3LmH_SEJXU&list=PL0143063B0D33439A&index=10|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=14 January 2013|author=ronnie creager|format=Video upload|date=7|month=February|year=2012}}</ref>

==Accolades==
In July 2013, professional skateboarder [[Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)|Paul Rodriguez]] included Creager in his "top ten" list of favorite professional skateboarders. In addition to recommending Creager's 1996 ''Trilogy'' video part, Rodriguez explained the selection on his personal website:

<blockquote>
I love that dude man. That guy, again.. style, creativity, technical abilities, precision. I would always be captivated by his skateboarding every time I would see anything from him. It seemed so easy and graceful when you would see him skate.<ref>{{cite web|title=PROD<U+2019>S TOP TEN: FAVORITE PRO<U+2019>S|url=http://prod84.com/prods-top-ten-favorite-pros/|work=The Official Paul Rodriguez Website|publisher=Rodskate, Inc|accessdate=24 July 2013|author=Paul Rodriguez|date=21 July 2013}}</ref></blockquote>
