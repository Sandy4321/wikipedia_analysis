The following is a list of the [[Governor#United States|Governors]] of the [[U.S. state|Commonwealth]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. The governor is the head of the [[executive branch]] of Pennsylvania's government and the [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's [[military]] forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to approve or [[veto]] [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s passed by the [[Pennsylvania Legislature]] and to convene the legislature.{{ref|const-art4|[A]}} The governor may grant pardons except in cases of [[impeachment]], but only when recommended by the Board of Pardons.{{ref|const-art4sec9cl1|[B]}}

The first constitution in 1776 created the [[Supreme Executive Council]] as the executive branch, with the President as its head.{{ref|1776const-sec3|[C]}} The president was chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.{{ref|1776const-sec19|[D]}} The 1790 constitution abolished the council and replaced the president with a governor,{{ref|1790const-art2sec1|[E]}} and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years.{{ref|1790const-art4sec3|[F]}} The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years.{{ref|1838const-art2sec3|[G]}} The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.{{ref|1874const-art4sec3|[H]}} The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms.{{ref|const-art4sec3|[I]}}

If the office of governor becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the [[president pro tempore|president ''pro tempore'']] of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor in that fashion. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same [[ticket (election)|ticket]].{{ref|greenpapers|[J]}} The original 1776 constitution created the position of "vice-president", though no provision was made if the office of president became vacant, which occurred four times. Contemporary sources continue to label the chief executive in such times as the vice president, without any notion of succeeding to the presidency. One acting president, [[George Bryan]], has since been recognized as a full-fledged governor, due to his acting as president for over six months.{{ref|phmc-bryan|[K]}} The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the death of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor.

There have been seven presidents and 45 governors of Pennsylvania, with two governors serving non-consecutive terms, totalling 54 terms in both offices. The longest term was that of the first governor, [[Thomas Mifflin]], who served three full terms as governor in addition to two years as president. The shortest term belonged to [[John C. Bell, Jr.]], who served only 19 days as acting governor after his predecessor resigned. The current governor is [[Ed Rendell]], whose second term began on [[January 16]] [[2007]].

Pennsylvania was one of the original [[thirteen colonies]], and was admitted as a state on [[December 12]] [[1787]]. Prior to declaring its independence, Pennsylvania was a [[Province of Pennsylvania|colony]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; see the list [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania|colonial governors]] for the pre-statehood period.

===Presidents of the Supreme Executive Council===
Presidents were elected by members of the Supreme Executive Council, and predated established political parties in the United States.
