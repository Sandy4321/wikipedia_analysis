[[Launceston]] has a cool, [[temperate climate]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Supervising Scientist Report | work = Australian Government | publisher = Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts | page = 4 | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/ssd/publications/ssr/pubs/ssr128-chap2.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2009-01-31 }}</ref> 
with four distinct seasons. The city is located in the [[Tamar Valley]] and is surrounded by many large hills and mountains. With this type of topography, Launceston's weather patterns can change considerably in a short period of time.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/australia/launceston/launceston-overview/geography-of-launceston.html|title = Geography of Launceston|publisher=Asia Rooms|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref>

The warmest months are in January and February with an average air temperature range of {{convert|12.2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|24.4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}}. Throughout the year there is an average of 4.3 days a year over {{convert|30|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}}. The maximum recorded temperature was {{convert|39|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}} on 30 January 2009, with Launceston Airport reaching {{convert|40.4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}} on that same day, during the [[2009 Southeastern Australia heat wave]].
Winters are cool with minimum temperatures dropping below {{convert|2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}} an average of 61 days a year. The coldest month is July, with an average temperature range of {{convert|2.2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}} - {{convert|12.5|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|abbr=on}}.
The lowest recorded minimum at Launceston's current weather station, Ti Tree Bend was {{convert|5.2|C|F}}, and unlike many other areas of Tasmania, Launceston rarely receives snowfall.

Winter, for Launceston, is also the season with the least amount of wind. Because of this and the topographical affect of the Tamar Valley, Launceston winters are renown for foggy mornings, with Launceston Airport the most fog-bound commercial airport in Australia. The average annual rainfall, with moderate to low variability is {{convert|665|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, falling an average of 88.4 days a year. The most rain Launceston received in a year was {{convert|829.6|mm}} in 1992, with 2006 being the driest year when just {{convert|394.8|mm}} fell. <ref name="Climate"/><ref name="BoM_MR">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/tas/20090130.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|work=Australian Government|title=Tasmania breaks all-time high temperature record again|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref><ref name="Record">{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/environmental-issues/422-deg-scamander-sets-states-hottest-record/1420740.aspx|publisher=The Examiner|work=Fairfax Media|title=42.2 deg: Scamander sets State's hottest record!|date=2009-01-31|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

== 2009 Southeastern Australia heat wave ==
[[File:09 Aus heatwave map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Approximate affected area shown in red]]

The 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave was a [[heat wave]] that commenced in late January and led to record-breaking prolonged high temperatures in the region. [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]] broke records for the most consecutive days over 40 <U+00B0>C (104 <U+00B0>F), with Melbourne surpassing 46 <U+00B0>C (115 <U+00B0>F) and Adelaide reaching over 45 <U+00B0>C (113 <U+00B0>F). Many locations through the region reached all-time high temperatures.  Adelaide reached its third-highest temperature, while Melbourne reached its highest temperature on record. The heat wave is predicted to be the worst in the region's history.<ref name="stories1">{{cite news  | title = Heatwave record set in Melbourne | work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | publisher = ABC News | date = 2009-01-30 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/30/2478827.htm | accessdate = 2009-02-01}}</ref> During the heat wave, 50 separate locations set various records for consecutive, highest daytime and overnight temperatures.

The exceptional heat wave was caused by a slow moving [[Atmospheric pressure|high-pressure system]] that settled over the [[Tasman Sea]], with a combination of an intense [[Tropical Cyclone|tropical low]] located off the [[North West Australia]]n coast and a [[monsoon trough]] over [[Northern Australia]], which produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed down over Southeastern Australia.<ref name="SCS17">{{Citation | title = The exceptional January-February 2009 heatwave in south-eastern Australia | publisher = National Climate Centre | work = Bureau of Meteorology | page = 2 | year = 2009 | date = 2009-02-04 | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs17.pdf }}</ref> The heat began in South Australia on 25 January but became more widespread over southeast Australia by 27 January.
