'''Noel Pearson''' (born [[June 25]], [[1965]], [[Cooktown]]) is an influential [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] [[Australia|Australian]] [[lawyer]], [[Aboriginal land claim|land rights activist]] and Director of the [[Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership]], an organisation promoting the economic and social development of [[Cape York]].

In the early part of his career Pearson was an advocate for land rights, but at the end of the 1990s he substantially shifted focus. Pearson has since then strongly argued that Indigenous policy needs to change direction, notably in relation to [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[substance abuse]], [[child welfare|child protection]], and [[economic development]]. Pearson criticises approaches to these problems which, while claiming to be "progressive," in his opinion merely keep Indigenous people dependent on welfare and out of the "real economy." He outlined this position in 2000 in his speech, [http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2000/00-08-12a.shtml The light on the hill].

== Life and work ==
===Early life===
Pearson grew up at [[Hopevale, Queensland|Hope Vale]], a [[Lutheran]] [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] in the [[Cape York Peninsula]]. He is the son of Glen Pearson, from the Bagaarrmugu clan, and Ivy Pearson, from the Guggu Yalanji peoples.<ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20656108-7583,00.html Walking in two worlds], provides further information about his family and community.</ref> His brother is [http://www.isx.org.au/people/1118146915_27626.html Gerhardt Pearson]. After attending primary school in Hope Vale, Pearson became a boarder at [[St Peters Lutheran College]] in [[Brisbane]].<ref>[http://www.cyi.org.au/director.aspx Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership].</ref> Pearson completed a history and a law degree at the [[University of Sydney]]. His history thesis focused on the Hope Vale Lutheran Mission, and was published by the History Department in "Maps Dreams History."

===1990s===
In 1990 Pearson co-founded the Cape York Land Council, where he was Executive Director until he resigned in 1996. Pearson's first official appointment was to a [[Government of Queensland|Queensland government]] taskforce which was formed to develop land rights legislation. He was also a legal advisor for the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]]. In 1993 Pearson acted as representative to the traditional owners in the first land claim to the [[Flinders Island (Queensland)|Flinders Island]] and [[Cape Melville]] [[National park|National Parks]], a claim which was successful, although the owners have yet to receive title. He continues to advise a number of Indigenous organisations in Cape York.

Following the [[Mabo v Queensland|Mabo decision]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] Pearson played a key part in negotiations over the [[Native Title Act 1993]] as a member of the Indigenous negotiating team.<ref>[[Gary Foley]], [http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/essays/essay_26.html The road to native title: The Aboriginal rights movement and the Australian Labor Party, 1973<U+2013>1996].</ref>

===2000s===
On August 12, 2000, Pearson delivered the [[Ben Chifley]] Memorial Lecture, with the title, [http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2000/00-08-12a.shtml The light on the hill]. It contained an important statement of his transformed views on Indigenous policy.

In 2004 Pearson became the Director of the [[Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership]].

On December 15, 2006, Pearson publicly criticised the [[Queensland]] [[Director of Public Prosecutions|Director of Public Prosecutions]], [[Leanne Clare]], in relation to her decision not to press charges against the police officer involved in the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody]] of [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]] resident [[Mulrunji]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200612/s1812190.htm DPP labelled incompetent after Palm Is charges decision].</ref> On January 26, 2007, Pearson welcomed the decision to prosecute the officer, after the inquiry by [[Laurence Street|Sir Laurence Street]] found there was sufficient evidence to press charges. Pearson also argued, however, that a 20- or 30-year plan was necessary for Palm Island.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,21124941,00.html Pearson calls for 20-year strategy].</ref>

On May 11, 2007, Pearson and [[Department_of_Families%2C_Community_Services_and_Indigenous_Affairs_%28Australia%29|Indigenous Affairs Minister]] [[Mal Brough]] launched a new welfare scheme for Pearson's home town of [[Hopevale, Queensland|Hope Vale]]. The scheme offers funds for home improvements, and low interest loans for home ownership.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2007/s1921087.htm Govt launches radical Indigenous welfare plan].</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/hope-for-pearsons-great-expectations/2007/05/11/1178390556521.html Hope for Pearson's great expectations].</ref> On May 24, Pearson published [http://www.boomerangaustralia.com/source/newsflash/Pearson_%20Indigenous_Australia.pdf White guilt, victimhood and the quest for a radical centre], a lengthy account of his understanding of the challenges of policy formulation and enactment. 

On June 19, 2007, Pearson launched a report by the Cape York Institute, [http://www.cyi.org.au/WEBSITE%20uploads/Welfare%20Reform%20Attachments/From%20Hand%20Out%20to%20Hand%20Up_Welfare%20Reform%20Report.pdf ''From Hand Out to Hand Up''], on welfare reform. The report was welcomed by Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Brough-backs-indigenous-welfare-overhaul/2007/06/19/1182019095663.html Brough backs indigenous welfare overhaul].</ref><ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,21931856,00.html Pearson defends Aboriginal welfare plan].</ref> On June 20, Pearson argued for the necessity of intervention in relation to Aboriginal child sexual abuse.<ref>Patricia Karvelas, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,21937815,00.html Pearson's challenge: spend a week watching indigenous abuses].</ref> On June 21, in response to a report entitled [[Little Children are Sacred|"Little Children are Sacred"]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] declared that problems of child abuse in [[Northern_Territory#Aboriginal_Australians|Northern Territory Aboriginal communities]] had reached a crisis point, and he initiated the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response|"national emergency response"]]. The response involved a series of interventions including, among other things, the insertion of police and health workers, welfare reform, and a ban on alcohol.<ref>Patricia Karvelas, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,21947691,00.html Crusade to save Aboriginal kids from abuse].</ref> Pearson indicated qualified support for these measures<ref>[http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/22/1959706.htm?section=australia Pearson fears for Indigenous parents' freedom].</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2007/s1962844.htm Noel Pearson discusses the issues faced by indigenous communities].</ref><ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,21951636,00.html Politics aside, an end to the tears is our priority].</ref><ref>Tony Koch & Dennis Shanahan, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,21968191,00.html Get parents who shield abusers: Pearson].</ref>, but has received some criticism for doing so.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pm-accused-of-black-land-grab/2007/07/09/1183833415790.html# PM accused of black land grab].</ref><ref>[http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=6272 An interview with Gary Foley: history will judge Howard's reforms].</ref> On July 18, the Indigenous Affairs Minister announced that the federal government would fund the welfare reform trials in Cape York recommended in ''From Hand Out to Hand Up''.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22094362-2702,00.html $48m pledge to Cape York welfare].</ref>

It was reported on September 20, 2007 that on August 12 Pearson had brokered a secret meeting between Mal Brough and Northern Territory Indigenous leader [[Galarrwuy Yunupingu]]. At the meeting Yunupingu changed his position in relation to the Northern Territory emergency response: rather than opposing the measures, Yunupingu decided the intervention was instead an opportunity for the Indigenous community. Yunupingu also signed a memorandum of understanding regarding a 99-year lease to be held over his community of Gunyangara (Ski Beach) in [[Arnhem Land]]. He also agreed to set up a council of elders in the Northern Territory to advise the government on the course of the intervention.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/top-leader-now-backs-territory-intervention/2007/09/19/1189881595071.html Top leader now backs Territory intervention].</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2039043.htm Indigenous leader signs 99-year land lease to Govt].</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/paternal-feelings-help-thrash-out-pact-for-nation/2007/09/20/1189881684476.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Paternal feelings help thrash out pact for nation].</ref><ref>Galarrwuy Yunupingu, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22453431-7583,00.html The challenge begins].</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/whose-coup-canberra-and-clan-both-celebrate-a-deal/2007/09/21/1189881777542.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Whose coup? Canberra and clan both celebrate a deal].</ref>

On November 14, 2007, it was reported that Pearson had accused the Queensland government of [[Anna Bligh]], and the federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] opposition led by [[Kevin Rudd]], of "selling out Aborigines," saying that a plan to prevent development of the Cape York region was a bid to gain [[Australian Greens|Greens]] preferences. Pearson argued that at the very moment when welfare reform was being attempted in Cape York, economic opportunities for the Aboriginal population would be "shot down" by such a move.<ref>Tony Koch, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22755299-11949,00.html Labor accused of selling Cape down the river].</ref>

On November 24, 2007, the day of the [[Australian federal election, 2007|Australian federal election]], Pearson strongly attacked the opposition leader Kevin Rudd for reneging, two days before the election, on his commitment to seek constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians.<ref>Padraic Murphy, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22808741-11949,00.html Rudd betrayed us, says Pearson].</ref><ref>[[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]], [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22811163-12250,00.html Pearson's dread of Rudd in power].</ref><ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22809264-601,00.html Noel Pearson's statement on Kevin Rudd].</ref><ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22811164-5013477,00.html Reconciliation U-turn shows leader's true colours].</ref> Rudd had initially pledged bipartisan support for John Howard's proposal, made on the first day of the election campaign, to pursue a referendum recognising Indigenous Australians, but it was reported on November 23 that Rudd had stated that, should he win the election, he was "unlikely to pursue Mr Howard's plan for a reconciliation preamble."<ref>Paul Kelly & Dennis Shanahan, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22806913-11949,00.html Rudd to turn back boatpeople].</ref> The day after Rudd won the election, Labor Senator [[Penny Wong]] defended their policy of concentrating on practical rather than symbolic measures, aimed at narrowing the gap between Indigenous and other Australians.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/25/2100503.htm Labor stands by 'practical' Indigenous policy].</ref>

On November 30, 2007, leading Indigenous academic [[Marcia Langton]] argued for the necessity of the emergency response in the Northern Territory. Langton supported Pearson's suggestions to shut down alcohol outlets and establish children's commissions and shelters in each community.<ref>Marcia Langton, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/its-time-to-stop-playing-politics-with-vulnerable-lives/2007/11/29/1196037070452.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 It's time to stop playing politics with vulnerable lives].</ref> On December 7, on the other hand, Philip Martin, who worked on the Welfare Reform Project in [[Aurukun, Queensland|Aurukun]] for Pearson's Cape York Partnerships between November 2006 and May 2007, argued that Pearson's welfare reform approach cannot work unless other problems, such as inadequate policing and housing, are also addressed.<ref>Philip Martin, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/bphilip-martinb-welfare-not-the-key/2007/12/06/1196812919663.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Welfare is not the key].</ref>

Speaking in response to the [[Aurukun rape case]] involving a 10-year old girl, Pearson said on December 12, 2007 that the case was "the tip of a tragic iceberg," and that there should be no hesitation in taking Aboriginal children out of dysfunctional and dangerous family circumstances.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2117225.htm Pearson calls for end to passive welfare].</ref><ref>Padraic Murphy & Tony Koch, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22916179-601,00.html Family's warnings ignored].</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/take-the-children-pearson/2007/12/13/1197135567984.html Take the children: Pearson].</ref> He did not, however, support calls to extend the Northern Territory emergency intervention to Queensland.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22923247-2702,00.html Pearson seeks inquiry into 'cover-up'].</ref> Pearson argued on December 15 that the sexual abuse of Aboriginal children may be lessened by establishing a "Families Responsibilities Commission" charged with making decisions about whether welfare recipients are fulfilling their obligations.<ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22926253-5013477,00.html Blame game ends here].</ref> Prime Minister Rudd ruled out extending the intervention to Queensland in the near future<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22932644-2702,00.html Rudd rules out extending NT program].</ref>, but stated that he was in discussion with the Queensland government about Pearson's proposal for a "Families Responsibilities Commission."<ref>Dennis Shanahan, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22940790-5013871,00.html Indigenous 'challenges' on COAG agenda].</ref>

On February 12, 2008, the eve of the parliamentary apology to the [[Stolen Generation|Stolen Generations]], Pearson explained his own complex and conflicted views on the question of an apology.<ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23196221-28737,00.html When words aren't enough].</ref>

In April 2008, after attending Kevin Rudd's [[Australia 2020 Summit]], Pearson argued that any proposed constitutional reform aimed at recognising indigenous Australians must be in a form acceptable to a wide range of the Australian population. He therefore indicated his belief that a "domestic agreement" would be preferable to a treaty between sovereign states.<ref>Natasha Robinson & Patricia Karvelas, [http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23596373-421,00.html Forget a treaty, say Pearson, Yunupingu].</ref><ref>Pearson, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23598709-5013477,00.html No progress without wide support].</ref>

Pearson argued in August 2008 that welfare benefits should not be granted to indigenous Australians under the age of 21.<ref>Patricia Karvelas & Padraic Murphy, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24221757-5013871,00.html Ban Aboriginal dole until 21, Noel Pearson pleads].</ref>
