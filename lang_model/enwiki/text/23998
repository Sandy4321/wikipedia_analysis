The '''Romano R.90''' was a prototype single-seat [[France|French]] [[floatplane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] of the 1930s. A single example of the R.90 was built, but the type did form the basis of the '''Romano R.83''' and '''Romano R.92''' fighters which were built in secret for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republicans]] during the Spanish Civil War.

==Design and development==
In 1933, the [[French Navy]] issued a specification for a single-seat [[seaplane]] fighter capable of being operated from the [[Aircraft catapult|catapults]] of its [[Cruiser]]s and [[Battleship]]s. To meet this requirement, the Chantiers A<U+00E9>ronavales Etienne Romano designed a [[floatplane]], the Romano R.90, with designs also being prepared by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire|Loire]], [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Avions Bernard|Bernard]] and [[Potez]].<ref name="Complete p353">Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 353.</ref>

Unlike the other three designs, the R.90 was a [[biplane]]. It was of mixed construction, with a welded steel-tube [[fuselage]] and wooden, [[interplane strut|single-bay]] wings,<ref name="Complete p502">Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 502.</ref> with the upper wings being [[Gull wing|gulled]] into the top of the fuselage to give a better view for the pilot.<ref name="Donald world p785">Donald 1997, p. 785.</ref> Two floats were fitted.<ref name="Complete p502"/> The proposed armament was four 7.5mm machine guns, two in the lower wing and two in the floats.<ref name="Flight 36p87">''Flight'' 23 January 1936, p. 87.</ref><ref name="avia R90-1">Parmentier, B. [http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9403&ID_CONSTRUCTEUR=1116&ANNEE=0&ID_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF= "Romano R-90"]. ''Aviafrance''. 30 November 2001. Retrieved 18 December 2010.</ref>

It made its maiden flight in August 1935, powered by a 720&nbsp;hp (537&nbsp;kW) [[Hispano-Suiza 9V]]brs radial engine. With this engine it reached a speed of 352&nbsp;km/h (219&nbsp;mph).<ref name="Complete p502"/> In October that year it was re-engined with a 680&nbsp;hp (507&nbsp;kW) [[Hispano-Suiza 14H]]brs radial in a [[NACA cowling]], increasing the speed and the floats were modified.<ref name="Donald world p785"/><ref name="Complete p502-3"/> It was re-engined again in October 1937 with a 900&nbsp;hp (671&nbsp;kW) [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y]]crs-1 [[V12 engine]] with a 20mm cannon firing through the propeller boss. Despite reaching 400&nbsp;km/h (248&nbsp;mph),<ref name="Complete p503">Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 503.</ref> faster than any of the other competitors,<ref name="Complete p62,353,481-2">Green and Swanborough 1994, pp. 62, 353, 481<U+2013>482.</ref> the R.90 was not ordered into production, 20 [[Loire 210]]s being purchased instead.<ref name="Complete p353"/>

Although the attempts to sell the R.90 to the French Navy failed, the aircraft attracted the attention of the [[Spanish Republican Air Force]], which placed an order for 24 of a landplane derivative, the Romano R.83. This differed in having a conventional fixed [[conventional landing gear|tailwheel undercarriage]], a non-gulled upper wing and was to be powered by a 450&nbsp;hp (336&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-985|Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior]] engine. These aircraft were to be assembled in secret by the Belgium company LACEBA (Les Atleliers de Construction et d'Exploitation de Brevets A<U+00E9>ronautiqes). Flight testing in Belgium was carried out with a 280&nbsp;hp (209&nbsp;kW) [[Salmson 9]]ABa engine, to give the impression that the aircraft was a trainer rather than a fighter, with the more powerful engine to be fitted when the aircraft was delivered to Spain.<ref name="Complete p503"/>

A second landplane fighter derivative was designed and built for the Spanish Republicans, the Romano R.92. This was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine as tested in the Romano R.90, and reverted to the gulled upper wing of the floatplane. A single example was built in 1938.<ref name="Complete p503"/>

==Operational history==
The first six R.83s were delivered to [[Barcelona]] between April and July 1938. The six R.83s were re-engined with the intended Wasp-Junior engines<ref name="Complete p503"/> and were probably used as advanced trainers.<ref name="Nash">Nash, David. [http://www.zi.ku.dk/personal/drnash/model/spain/did.html "Aircraft that took part in the Spanish Civil War"]. ''Aircraft of the Spanish Civil War''. Retrieved 18 December 2010.</ref>  The remaining 18 R.82s had not been completed by the time the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in April 1939.<ref name="Complete p503"/> The sole R.92 was also delivered to Spain in 1938, but any use is unknown.<ref name="Complete p503"/>
