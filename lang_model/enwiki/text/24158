'''Charles Edward "Charlie" Eppes''' (played by [[David Krumholtz]]) is a [[fictional character]] and [[protagonist]] in the [[CBS]] [[crime drama]] ''[[Numb3rs]]''.

Dr. Charles Edward Eppes is portrayed as a young [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[genius]]  and [[professor]] of [[applied mathematics]] at the fictional ''California Institute of Science'', ''CalSci'' (primarily based on [[Caltech]], where some filming and mathematics consulting is done). As a world-class [[mathematician]], Charlie helps his brother [[Don Eppes]] solve many of his perplexing FBI cases, sometimes with the help of his best friend, mentor and colleague [[Larry Fleinhardt]] and his on-again off-again girlfriend, former student and now fianc<U+00E9>e, [[Amita Ramanujan]], who further refines Charlie's approach and helps him stay focused. Charlie has consulted for the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), in part as a [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], for nearly five years, having attained TS/SCI security clearance. It was revoked at the end of season four after he transmitted information to Pakistan, but has recently been re-instated.

==Backstory==
According to Eppes' [[Alan Eppes|father]], he could multiply four-digit numbers mentally at age three and at the age of four required special teachers. In the second grade, he attempted to find a 70-digit [[narcissistic number]] in [[Duodecimal|base 12]] &mdash; Eppes has described himself as "[[Quixotism|quixotic]]" in elementary school. A [[child prodigy|prodigy]], he attended [[Princeton University]] at the age of 13 after graduating from high school at the same time as his brother who is five years his senior ("Soft Target"), and took Professor Lawrence Fleinhardt's [[quantum physics]] course in his first year. They became fast friends, with Fleinhardt establishing his academic connections. Eppes published his first mathematical [[treatise]] at the age of 14 (in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'') and graduated at the age of 16. In fact, he was the youngest person to ever write a paper of importance.  

It was his paper on the Eppes [[limit of a function|convergence]], which concerned [[asymptote|asymptotics]] of [[Hermitian]] [[Random matrix|random matrices]], that made him a star in his field. Following a seminar that heavily criticized this seminal piece many years after its initial publication, Charlie realized that his work with the FBI has prevented him from doing [[research]] significant to other mathematicians and now hopes to spend decades on [[cognition|cognitive]] [[emergence|emergence theory]] ("the mathematics of the brain") to rectify this certain inequity, which has delighted Fleinhardt. Although he was a child prodigy, Charlie now moreover fears the fact that his best years in his research will never come ahead of schedule again.

Eppes is a multiple [[Ph.D.]] ("Decoy Effect"), a recipient of the Milton Prize and a nominee for the [[Fields Medal]]. Following his five-year research on [[random matrix|random matrices]], Charlie worked on [[sequence]]s with [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[symmetry]]. He has also provided insights for possibly solving the [[P = NP problem|P=NP problem]] and published works on [[H<U+221E>|H-infinity]] [[Nonlinear control|Control of Non-Linear Systems]] and [[computational fluid dynamics]], while his current research is in [[cognition|cognitive]] [[emergence|emergence theory]]. He has presented seminars on [[harmonic analysis]] and the [[Root of a function|zeros]] of [[randomness|random]] [[orthogonal polynomials]] and given lectures on [[group theory]] and [[Kac<U+2013>Moody algebra]]s. Eppes has taught courses on [[calculus]], [[chaos theory]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[game theory]] and [[probability]] at CalSci in addition to giving guest [[lecture]]s on [[probability theory|applied probability]]. The lecture in which he converted the classroom into a miniature [[casino]] for analyzing probabilities is considered an "Eppes Classic". Also, Eppes has taken over Fleinhardt's [[computational physics]] class when he was asked to do so, and has given a joint lecture on [[circular motion]] and the [[Coriolis effect]] with Fleinhardt.

==Characterization==
Charlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and frequently enthralled with objects and patterns. His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses a big heart and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is "a talented [[theory|theoretician]] with an ego problem" and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a [[pragmaticism|pragmatist]]. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of [[Occam's razor]]) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as "[[Charlie Eppes#CharlieVision|audience visions]]" or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, "those cute little analogies.") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes [[equation]]s, often covering several [[blackboard|chalkboards]] with a staccato clacking and the aid of a red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted <U+2014> he has to write what is in his head. Like his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive ("one part exuberance, two parts obsession"), especially when it comes to work, but he's rather na<U+00EF>ve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times. 

He is extremely talented in [[chess]], as it requires both his father and brother to play against him and a distraction to defeat him. Charlie also has a vast understanding of [[theoretical physics]], often assisting Larry with his multi-dimensional [[supergravity|supergravity theory]] and papers on [[gravitational wave|gravity waves]], and [[biology]], extending to knowledge of [[ciliate]] [[protozoa]] and the spread of infectious diseases. While brilliant in some areas, he is lacking in others. He is apparently a bad speller (e.g., he misspells "anomaly" and "conceited") and does not know the meaning of "[[defenestration]]" (for which Larry chastises him stating that the idealization is to be a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] and that even math and physics majors had to have a course on English). Thus, his father likes playing [[Scrabble]] with him.

Charlie is a rationalist<ref name="Paula Hendrickson">{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003055.html?categoryid=3611&cs=1 |title=Spirituality adds depth to 'Numbers'|accessdate=July 7, 2009|author=Paula Hendrickson |date=April 30, 2009| publisher=Variety.com}}</ref>.

According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants to understand how the world works<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6845064/ |title=Shooting for right formula on <U+2018>Numb3rs<U+2019>

==Evolution over the series==
The episode "Uncertainty Principle" is significant for the backstory it gives on the familial relationships, particularly Charlie's difficulty in dealing with his mother's death from cancer. While it's unclear how Don reacted, Charlie spent the last three months of his mother's life isolated in the garage, incessantly working on one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]], specifically [[P = NP problem|P vs NP]]; it's a point of contention between the brothers. Also, Charlie doesn't think Don understood what he went through during their school years, especially how he was treated as "Don's brainiac little brother" by his peers in high school, and how he often left him to his own resources as a child, though he was not as inept as Don had reasoned. However, Charlie's relationship with Don remains strong, as he has begun to increasingly fear for his brother's safety on the job and still looks to his older brother for acceptance. Charlie and his father worry about Don committing to relationships, and for a time, fear that he had been cheating on Robin Brooks. Ironically, Charlie has similar problems with women himself. After a couple dozen murder cases, Charlie is somewhat jaded and world-weary like his brother. FBI agent [[David Sinclair (Numb3rs)|David Sinclair]] of Don's team even comments that he has never seen two brothers so similar and yet so different. In "The Janus List", the brothers seem to take on each other's tendencies a bit. Though, in season five, Charlie is dismayed that Don does not reveal to him his newfound religious faith.

In "Prime Suspect," Charlie purchases the beautiful [[Arts and Crafts movement|Craftsman]] family home from his father, who continues to live with him. Now 30 years old, Charlie wants to be responsible and take care of his father but still believes that much of the pressures involving their dad has been put on his shoulders as Don doesn't seem to have enough time. Realizing this, Alan set his sights on moving out to accomplish things on his own, with Charlie seemingly supporting the idea, but has since chosen to stay as he favors his son's company. Recently, Charlie is bothered by his father trying to impose his will on him with maintaining the house, as he is a full [[tenure]]d professor at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country working on "life-altering" mathematics, i.e., in solving crimes. Alan just wants him to be responsible and not end up like Larry, though Mr. Eppes respects Fleinhardt. Even he has thought of this possibility and decides to do more around the home. After Charlie compares his own situation to that of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] his father looks into information on the [[physicist]] and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother ([[JoBeth Williams]]) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up. 

Charlie's research often interferes with his relationships: as with Amita on their first date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt says that it is a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry ([[Sonya Walger]]), an attractive [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] from [[London, England|London]]. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own [[Geometric phase|Berry's phase]]. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to [[England]]. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at [[Harvard University]] strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but by the middle of the third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being [[Jewish]], but the problem is that he is not [[India]]n-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.

Unforeseen complications with his work emerge as the new [[Chair (official)|Chair]] of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, [[List of Numb3rs characters#Mildred Finch|Dr. Mildred Finch]], in the episode "Waste Not", makes Charlie head of the [[Ph.D.]] admissions committee against his wishes, bogging him down with more work, and gives him pressures about using the school's [[supercomputer]] for FBI work or missing classes for such. This leads to Charlie being confrontational, but she calms him when she says she just wants him to be "the [[Sean Connery]] of the mathematics [[academic department|department]]." In the episode "Take Out", Charlie and Millie attend a black tie reception for CalSci fundraising and bond. Soon after, Charlie is asked by Millie to meet with Macmillan Pharmaceuticals, which according to Amita has a reputation for exploiting third-world countries. Amita serves as his conscience in this matter, and he goes to see Dr. Finch about it. With "Pythagorean wit," he dazzles Macmillan and is to serve as a mathematical consultant for the pharmaco-kinetic [[model (abstract)|modelling]] project, only under the provision that CalSci will administer the trials and monitor the drug at every step, all computational analyses are conducted by Charlie and his team, and 5% of the gross will go to third-world AIDS organizations chosen by Professors Eppes and Ramanujan . In "Democracy", as part of his duties, he recruits the young [[fantasy baseball]] and [[sabermetrics]] fanatic Oswald Kittner ([[Jay Baruchel]]), who shows great promise, to attend CalSci.

When Larry announces his leave of absence to board the [[International Space Station]] (in the episode "Brutus"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in [[denial]] about Larry's ambitions and he thinks reason of the risks involved will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered. Amita says to Larry, "[Charlie] has never dreamt of something he couldn't reach, so he has no idea what it is like to want something he is not able to get. So how could he understand how much [Larry] you would give up when this chance comes along?" Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In "Killer Chat", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus [[steam tunnel]]s. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the [[academic]] firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky t-shirt.

In "The Art of Reckoning", Charlie is initially overjoyed to see his friend Larry return, but Charlie is dismayed with Larry's lack of enthusiasm in life, so Charlie doesn't object to him readjusting at a monastery. His concern is apparent, and he says he just wants his friend back.

Since then, in "Trust Metric", Charlie is pleased to see his friend doing well, feeling that he needed a friend, and is glad to have focused on teaching while Don did not include him with FBI work; though, on previous occasions, he expressed the desire to be involved. Granger's escape from the prison bus causes him to become active in helping his brother once more, allowing him a chance to use set covering deployment. 

Dr. Finch tells him to publish, and so he has renewed interest in old research, having decided to publish one of his eleventh-grade papers he started at nine years old, "The Mathematics of Friendship," with an addendum. A publishing company has turned his work into a classic book for those not mathematically inclined, while opting for a title with more pizazz, "Friendship, As Easy as Pi." Charlie takes joy in the belief that this book will allow his thoughts to reach a much wider audience than before. By the episode "In Security," the published book appears with the title "The Attraction Equation" and a dapper photo on the back cover of him holding a sculpture of a [[stellation|stellated]] [[icosidodecahedron]] with bevelled edges. A [[decision theory|decision theoretic]] approach to relationships is covered in the book. His proud father hands copies to friends and Larry sells signed copies on [[eBay]]. He apparently has some fans and gives into a televised interview.

In "Checkmate", Charlie is training in weapons and tactics in LA's FBI school, where he is shown to have a high skill in marksmanship at the range, impressing many of his FBI training peers as well as his instructor. He is given a certificate of marksmanship by the FBI. In the episode "Pay to Play", Charlie convinces Don to let him join the team when they go to arrest a suspect, mentioning that he passed the FBI course.

In the season four finale "When Worlds Collide", Charlie helps an innocent colleague accused of terrorism by sending genetic research to scientists at Pakistani universities which is prohibited, with full cognizance of the consequences.  As a result, Charlie is arrested, loses his security clearance and ultimately loses his ability to help Don on FBI cases. Once again, Charlie holds strong to his ideals. In the previous season's "Burn Rate", Charlie has strong opinions concerning [[genetic engineering]], believing bomb suspect, fellow prodigy, physicist and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] student Emmett Glaser's ideas about genetic predeterminism are rational, not incendiary, and helps to clear his name.

The charges against Dr. Eppes are dropped. For a time, Don Eppes' team is attempting to make do with Fleinhardt's and Amita's expertise, but Charles' assistance is sorely missed to the point of consulting him secretly.  For his part, Charles has been convinced by his lawyer and father to attempt to have his clearance restored. Even Don supports the idea and stands up to security clearance investigator Carl McGowan ([[Keith Carradine]]), stating to go after him, not his brother. Temporarily, Charlie works as a LAPD consultant until the fiasco with his security clearance can be resolved. He later gets his clearance back and is working with his brother and the FBI again. He is trying to assert himself in the methodology used to solve a crime, having struggled with not being included, but some friction arises with Amita and Larry. 

Charlie works once again with rival Marshall Penfield, as they settle their differences ("Frienemies"). Also, he is chosen to be the head of the think tank model comprising himself, Larry, Alan, and Amita ("Jacked"). As Dr. Eppes applies the [[Turing Test]] to a seemingly unique artificial intelligence, he is tricked only to come to the realization that the computer only uses a recursive algorithm to apply the most human responses, while simultaneously being tempted by an offer to work for [[DARPA]]. Head of DARPA special projects Jane Karellen ([[Nancy Travis]]) knows that he has a limited window to use his genius and tells Charlie that he is one of the top five minds on the planet. Amita's life is even threatened by the advanced computer ("First Law").  For some time, he coaches the unfortunate CalSci basketball team through his mathematical analyses with his father and Larry ("12:01 AM").

Late in season five, Charlie moves into a new office.  While moving, he gets some inspiration for his cognitive emergence theory, which causes him to momentarily set aside his work on a series of home invasions for Don.  Don is stabbed while attempting to arrest the home invaders ("The Fifth Man").  Charlie blames himself for Don being stabbed and throws himself into his FBI consultation work as a result ("Disturbed").  This worries everyone, especially Don, who tells him to "do whatever you want to do" ("Greatest Hits") while visiting Charlie in his new office. Around this time, Charlie is also presented with a series of letters from previous successive holders of this prestigious office, wherein each celebrated mathematician writes of accomplishments they intend to achieve, passing down the torch to the next in line to do the same. At first Charlie is hesitant, until the very determined Amita convinces him to write the corresponding letter and eases his burdens, as Charlie fears he cannot meet his destiny with so much weight to succeed being placed on his shoulders his entire life. 

At the end of the season, while leaving for dinner, Charlie is attacked, and Amita is kidnapped.  Charlie is so emotionally distraught that he cannot think of the math needed to find Amita. With the help of Don, Alan, and David, Charlie snaps out of it to locate Amita.  Amita is rescued.  He realizes that he did not want to lose Amita, and he proposes to her ("Angels and Devils").

At the end the premiere episode of the program's sixth season, it was revealed that Amita has accepted Charlie's proposal. The issue was skirted throughout the episode, as the two were waiting until Amita officially received permission from her parents.  He and Amita discuss the number of children that they want to have, and they both decide that they may need to participate in the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America |Big Brother/Big Sister]] program for some practical experience before having children.  Charlie learns about Alan's financial status and offers to help him.  Alan asks him for computer lessons.  Charlie reluctantly agrees, and the lesson does not go well as the computer software is not user-friendly.  He and Amita attempt to find a wedding date that is suited to their and their families' schedules; Alan suggests that they should take his and Margaret's anniversary date as Charlie and Amita's date.

==Reception==
Early reception of Charlie varied according the audience in question. Due to television production<U+2019>s traditional approach of utilizing only two worlds for filming, production staff initially opposed the idea of Charlie being a college professor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/864/864476p2.html |title=The Return of Numb3rs: Behind the Scenes |accessdate=September 2, 2009 |author=Travis Fickett |date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=IGN.com}}</ref>  Some even unsuccessfully suggested to Heuton and Falacci that Charlie should be working with the FBI full-time as an employee.<ref name="Travis Fickett">{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/864/864476p3.html |title=The Return of Numb3rs: Behind the Scenes |accessdate=September 2, 2009 |author=Travis Fickett |date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=IGN.com}}</ref>

When the pilot was previewed, the reception was more positive.

==''CharlieVision''==

''CharlieVision'' (as labeled by the show's creators) is the mode in which Charlie's insights are displayed on-screen. It consists of fast-paced visions or cutscenes often characterized by [[false-color image]]s that integrate his analogies and [[mathematical model]]s, usually followed by him rushing off to tell Don about his new insights. 'CharlieVision' is not to be confused with "audience visions," in which Charlie's voice uses an analogy to simplify a mathematical concept while corresponding images are flashed on screen.  [[Ridley Scott]] and [[Tony Scott]], executive producers for Numb3rs, designed the specifics of the Charlie-visions, such as the ash yellow color that appears on-screen when Charlie suddenly becomes inspired<ref name="Travis Fickett"/>.
