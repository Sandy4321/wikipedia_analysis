'''''Bleed Like Me''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] recorded and produced by [[alternative rock]] group [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]. It was released in April 2005 by [[Universal Music Group]] label [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] in North America and by [[Warner Bros. Records]] in other territories. The group chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of Garbage's live performances instead of the [[electronica]] that permeated the previous album, ''[[Beautiful Garbage]]'' (2001).

The first recording sessions for ''Bleed Like Me'' took place in March 2003, but were mostly unproductive due to passive aggression between band members [[Duke Erikson]], [[Shirley Manson]], [[Steve Marker]] and [[Butch Vig]], and a general lack of direction. As Garbage struggled to create the album, the band quietly split for four months starting October 2003. They reunited under producer [[John King (producer)|John King]] in [[Los Angeles]], and following a guest appearance by [[Dave Grohl]] on "Bad Boyfriend", the band found a renewed focus on production. The band recruited drummer [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] and bassist [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] for new recording sessions, and completed the album by the end of 2004.

Following critical appraisal and positive chart positions for its lead single "[[Why Do You Love Me]]", ''Bleed Like Me'' had a strong opening week globally, debuting in the top five in eight countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. Reviews were mixed to positive, and critics praised the new sound but found the album inconsistent and at times outdated.

==Background==
Garbage's third album, ''Beautiful Garbage'', had been promoted by a [[Beautiful Garbage tour|fourteen-month world tour]], which culminated in a run of North American shows co-headlined with [[No Doubt]] and supported by [[The Distillers]] in October and November 2002.<ref name="Fresh Garbage">{{cite web | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030811084403/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=18284|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=18284|archivedate=2003-08-11|first=Colin|last=Devenish|date=2003-06-26| title=Fresh Garbage in the works | publisher=Rolling Stone | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Before the tour started, the band spent two weeks in [[Smart Studios]]{{mdash}}their recording studio in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]{{mdash}}to write new material for their upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://rehage.com/v5/press_view-voodoo.php?id=377| title=Garbage|date=2002-11-01|author=Spera, Keith | work=[[The Times-Picayune]]| accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Upon completion of the tour in December 2002, the group took some time out; [[Shirley Manson]] returned to her native Scotland, while [[Butch Vig]] completed production work on albums by [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[Jessy Moss]]. The band regrouped to perform "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" at a [[MusiCares]] tribute to [[U2]] frontman [[Bono]]. Immediately after the event, they returned to Madison to continue working on their follow-up record.<ref name=live/>

==Recording and production==

===Initial recording and band breakdown===
On the first day in the studio, Garbage composed a new track, "Right Between the Eyes", in thirty minutes.<ref name="Geffen">{{cite web | url=http://www.geffen.com/garbage | title=''Bleed Like Me'' press release | publisher=Geffen.com | accessdate=2007-06-21|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930160910/http://www.geffen.com/garbage|archivedate=2007-09-30}}</ref> Other tracks written during the early sessions were "Hangin' with the Bitches"<ref name="Fresh Garbage"/> and "Never Be Free" (with [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=12560 | title= MARILYN MANSON Guitarist To Guest On New GARBAGE Album?|date=2003-06-06| publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]| accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Vig said that the quick start made the band feel optimistic and gave the impression that the album would be completed as quickly as six months, but "[the album] took a slow spiral downhill".<ref name=live>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499967/garbage-lp-captures-live-sound.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=2005-04-12|title=Garbage Work On Issues, Get Inspired By Loud Rock ...

Both Garbage and the band [[Paris, Texas (band)|Paris, Texas]] had been working on their albums.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/15160 | title=Nirvana Studios Now Complete Garbage! | work=NME|date=2003-09-25 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> The sessions were permeated by passive-aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus. According to Vig, "there were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn't agree on songs". Manson suffered a writer's block and had trouble writing lyrics, and Vig did not like the way the songs sounded.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/07/news/wk-pop7|title=Garbage sticks together|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-04-07|first=Steve|last=Baltin |accessdate=2013-01-26}}</ref> The drummer said that the group frequently argued during production, and that the entire band almost quit.<ref name="hot"/> [[Duke Erikson]] said that nobody could agree about the music's direction, and the band was on the verge of breaking up. He said, "when you lose that common bond of the music, you've got nothing".<ref name="Geffen"/> Eventually, the group suffered "a complete and utter band meltdown" in October, leading the band members splitting and taking a break from the sessions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?id=20031017|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090202040125/http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?id=20031017|archivedate=2009-02-02 | title=10.17.03 Studio Diary #10 |author=Manson, Shirley | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> 

Vig left the sessions and returned to [[Los Angeles]]. Over the Christmas period, he encountered excited Garbage fans eager to hear about the album's progress. Not wanting to disappoint them, he disclosed some song titles. After this encounter he realised that the band still had a future.<ref name="Geffen"/> During the break, Vig casually asked [[Dave Grohl]] of [[Foo Fighters]] to drum on a Garbage track, "Bad Boyfriend", as Vig had been frustrated with the song's existing drum track.<ref name=radar/>

===Regrouping===
At the beginning of 2004, the band decided to try and salvage the album, taking their management's suggestion to work with an external producer for the first time. The musicians also decided that neutral territory would be beneficial, and went to Los Angeles. [[Dust Brothers|Dust Brother]] [[John King (producer)|John King]] was hired to produce "Bad Boyfriend",<ref name="Geffen"/> "Space Can Come Through Anyone",<ref name="WDYLMcredits">""Why Do You Love Me" sleeve credits" (Retrieved - 2007-06-21)</ref> and "It's All Over But the Crying". Drummer [[Matt Chamberlain]] and bassist [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] were hired to perform on the songs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=152 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090202044201/http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=152|archivedate=2009-02-02| title=01.26.04 Studio Diary #13 |author=Manson, Shirley | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> The recordings were completed in King's studio The Boat and [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] in [[Van Nuys]].<ref name=gc>{{cite web|url=http://gc.guitarcenter.com/interview/garbage/|title=An Interview with Butch Vig of Garbage|publisher=[[Guitar Center]]|date=April 2005|accessdate=2013-02-05}}</ref> Towards the end of the recording sessions, Grohl spent a day performing on drums for "Bad Boyfriend".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/16133 | title=Garbage Drumming!!! |date=2004-02-11| publisher=NME.com | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> The band said his performance was "raising the bar" for the record,<ref name="Geffen"/> and Vig said that Grohl "brought a different energy level to the song", which Erikson and [[Steve Marker]] tried to follow with their guitar playing. This influenced most of the songs that followed; the musicians wanted the songs to be "scrappy and primal sounding".<ref name=hot>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/music/interviews/Blood-On-The-Tracks/2793931.html|title=Blood on the Tracks|work=[[Hot Press]]|first=Peter|last=Murphy|date=2005-04-19|accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref>

The experience with King, despite only resulting in the completion of one track, "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction.<ref name="Geffen"/> Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized that they needed to work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously.<ref name=live/> Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play  "...fast and furious{{mdash}}as if our lives depended on it".<ref name=love>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sRQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11|title=For The Love of Garbage|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=16 April 2005|author=Paoletta, Michael}}</ref> Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both "Metal Heart" and "Boys Wanna Fight" referenced the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. Despite a plan to record some material with producer [[Tony Hoffer]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=149|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090203062824/http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=149|archivedate=2009-02-03 | title=02.16.04 Studio Diary #16|author=Manson, Shirley  | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, "It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [would] solve all of our problems, but in the end you gotta do it yourself".<ref name=mtv>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497359/garbage-reunite-new-lp.jhtml | title=Garbage Breakup Ends With New LP <U+2014> If They Did Actually Break Up | publisher=MTV|date=2005-02-22|author=Moss, Corey | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> 

Feeling that previous album ''beautifulgarbage'' seemed fractured, the band decided to use their live sound; Vig said that he wanted "the pumping energy that all the best raw rock records have".<ref name="rhythm">{{cite web | url=http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/rhythm/index.html | title=The Trick Is To Keep Breathing |work=[[Rhythm (music magazine)|Rhythm]] magazine|date=June 2005 | accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070611202542/http://www.garbage.suite.dk/articles/rhythm/index.html |archivedate = 2007-06-11}}</ref> The band decided that their fourth album would have a straightforward rock sound, instead of a reliance upon [[electronica]] and computer interventions. The musicians composed separately at their home studios, sending each other tracks through e-mail and couriers, and the band returned to Wisconsin to finish the album. ''Bleed Like Me'' emerged from a collage of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[loop (music)|loops]], this time the sound was simpler. Erikson said that rather than production, they depended on the songs.<ref name=Geffen/> Vig opted to focus on the production duties and leave the drums to guest musicians, which he considered better at the instrument than him. He also played more guitars on the album, which Vig found liberating.<ref name=radar>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/6-career-defining-records-of-butch-vig-211529/7|title=6 career defining records of Butch Vig|work=[[Rhythm (music magazine)|Rhythm magazine]]|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref><ref name=gc/> As a result, drummer [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] played on several  tracks on the album,<ref name=diary29/> while Meldal-Johnsen played bass.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?id=20040906|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071112004944/http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?id=20040906|archivedate=2007-11-12 | title=09.06.04 Studio Diary #24 |author=Manson, Shirley | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Most of Manson's vocals were recorded at Vig's home studio, GrungeIsDead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gearslutz.com/board/4318082-post4.html|date=2009-06-25|title=GrungeIsDead |publisher=Butch Vig & Billy Bush at GearSlutz|accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref>

''Bleed Like Me'' is a departure from the electronic-heavy music of previous albums ''[[Version 2.0]]'' and ''beautifulgarbage'' in favor of a basic [[alternative rock]] sound. Vig said that while he tried to figure out a new sound for the record, he "went back to getting great sounds from guitars". The band tried a more spontaneous approach; Manson did most of her singing in the first take and the drums were recorded in a way "that everything was not perfectly balanced{{mdash}}and not so electronic".<ref name=love/> The band members tried to translate the energy of the band's live performances onto the album; Marker said that the album showed that above all, Garbage is a loud rock band.<ref name=Geffen/> Vig still thought that some of the songs resembled the band's earlier material, such as "Metal Heart", with "a lot of weird electronics that Steve and Duke did, as well as some pretty gnarly guitar."<ref name=tour>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497733/garbage-tour-kicks-off-april.jhtml|date=2005-03-03|title=Shirley Manson Gets Ready To Sing And Type On Garbage Tour|publisher=MTV|first=Corey|last=Moss|accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>

The lyrics of ''Bleed Like Me'' talk about relationships and political themes; Manson said, "the last few years&nbsp;...&nbsp;have been very worrying and you'd have to be dead to not have some kind of political view at the moment",<ref name=kerrang>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071112005020/http://www.garbage.com/news/news.php?id=20050220|archivedate=2007-11-12 |url=http://www.garbage.com/news/news.php?id=20050220 | title=New Blood: Make Way For The Return Of Garbage| work=[[Kerrang!]]|date=2005-02-22 | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref>

''Bleed Like Me'' received positive to mixed reviews upon release. Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] reported a score of 56 based on 18 reviews.<ref name=mc>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/bleed-like-me |title=Bleed Like Me Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Tom Sinclair rated the album a B+, complimenting the "humongous hooks".<ref name=ew/> and [[Kerrang!]] gave ''Bleed Like Me'' 4 out of 5, describing it as the "most exciting, touching, and most painfully human material they<U+2019>ve put out in years".<ref name=krev/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer [[David Fricke]] awarded the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that "the first two-thirds of ''Bleed Like Me'' is easily the best sustained run of studio Garbage since the opening half of their 1995 debut", but that the final tracks had "a sameness{{mdash}}a feeling of roaring in circles".<ref name=rs/> Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]'' also awarded it three and a half stars out of five; he praised the new sound and wrote that "a few of the songs ("Run Baby Run" and "Right Between the Eyes" in particular) have all the right ingredients but lack the venom present on the group's first two releases".<ref name=slant/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] gave ''Bleed Like Me'' three stars out of five, writing that the album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach "as if the band doesn't quite know how to do anything else but sound like it's the heyday of post-grunge alt-rock."<ref name=amg/> This opinion was shared by [[Yahoo! Music]]'s Sharon O<U+2019>Connell, who wrote that despite the intelligent songs with expertise in "muscly, alt. rock lick or the bubblegum pop hook", ''Bleed Like Me'' "strikes a depressingly dated note".<ref name=yahoo/>

Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', [[Nathan Rabin]] said the album's lyrics lacked an emotional punch. He wrote stating that it "approaches a kind of shimmering technical perfection, but remains strangely, stubbornly uninvolving".<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/garbage-bleed-like-me,10931/|title=Garbage: Bleed Like Me|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|date=April 12, 2005|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=2012-10-23}}</ref>  Betty Clarke of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "while Manson's changeling vocals are always worth listening to, Garbage's songs often aren't."<ref name=guard/> Philip Robertson of [[PopMatters]] awarded the album four out of ten, and said the music sounds manufactured in its too-polished manner, and that Manson's performance feels as though she "tries so hard to sound like a tantalizingly young seductress that she occasionally borders on a laughably lascivious even promiscuous woman desperately out to prove that she still has <U+2018>it<U+2019>."<ref name=pop/>
