'''''Bo' Selecta!''''' is a British [[sketch show]] written and performed by [[Leigh Francis]], known for its often deeply [[surreal humour|surreal]], abstract [[toilet humour]], which lampoons popular culture. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] and ran for three series between 2002 and 2004, spawning several spin-offs. Francis played Avid Merrion, a dangerously insane [[Stalking|stalker]], who conducts celebrity interviews whilst wearing an array of, latex masks, each one resembling at least vaguely a famous personage. The most popular sketches involve entertainers such as [[Elton John]], [[David Blaine]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Mel B]] and [[Craig David]]. Another recurring character on the show is 'the Bear', a perverted, foul-mouthed [[Teddy bear|teddy]] who spews a constant barrage of filth at his guests, often before exposing himself. The series title is based on a line from the [[Craig David]] song "[[Re-Rewind]]." Much of the show's humour is derived from the deliberate ineptitude of each impersonation and general incongruity; famous scenes include Avid slapping [[Justin Timberlake]] with some raw meat, and trying to seduce [[Patsy Kensit]] while in character as [[Melanie Brown|Mel B]]. Despite a loyal following and some strong reviews, the show has been singled out by several critics for allegedly promoting narrow-mindedness and puerile behaviour.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1892588,00.html 'We're just mucking about'] The Guardian, 11 October 2006</ref> The show is currently being re-broadcast by [[4Music]].{{When|date=December 2011}}

'may return'] BBC News, 24 September 2009</ref> The possibility of a further series was hinted during the special episode 'A Bear's Chrimbo Top 20,' in which The Bear stated that 'Avid' may be returning to our screens. Plans for a new series have since been put on hold, as [[Leigh Francis|Leigh]] revealed on twitter that plans for Bo' Selecta were on hold as he was working on a script for a possible movie for another project.

Nearly all of the episodes of the series have been released on DVD. The six main episodes from series one were released under the banner "Bo Selecta: Vol 1".

This leaves only the pilot episode, both parts of "Proper Bo Selecta" and "The Bear's Chrimbo Top 20" unreleased.

==Reception==
Although many celebrities lampooned in the series appreciated the joke, and even appeared in the series, the series' most prominently mocked target did not enjoy the attention. Speaking to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 2007, [[Craig David]] confessed that "Inside it was absolutely pissing me off and hurtful beyond belief. There were times when I thought I just want to knock this guy out." Although David made an appearance himself in the programme, he regretted it even as he was making it: "I didn<U+2019>t want people to think, <U+2018>Craig<U+2019>s reacting to it,<U+2019> because then they would think, <U+2018>How can we get up Craig<U+2019>s nose even more?<U+2019> So I did it, but I wasn<U+2019>t happy about it."<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2773124.ece Craig David: No laughing matter] The Sunday Times, 4 November 2007</ref>
