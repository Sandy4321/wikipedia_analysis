'''Seth Ward''' (1617 &ndash; [[6 January]] [[1689]]) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], and [[bishop]].

==Early life==

He was born in [[Hertfordshire]], and educated at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1636 and M.A. in 1640, becoming a Fellow in that year.<ref>{{Venn|id=WRT632S|name=Ward, Seth}}</ref><ref name = Galileo>[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/ward.html Galileo project page]</ref> In 1643 he was chosen university mathematical lecturer, but he was deprived of his fellowship next year for opposing the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] (with [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Isaac Barrow]], [[John Barwick]] and [[Peter Gunning]]).<ref name = Galileo/>

==Academic==

In the 1640s, he took instruction in mathematics from [[William Oughtred]], and stayed with relations of [[Samuel Ward (scholar)|Samuel Ward]].<ref>http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/oughtred.html</ref><ref name = Galileo/>

In 1649 he became [[Savilian chair of astronomy|Savilian professor of astronomy]] at [[Oxford University]], and gained a high reputation by his theory of [[planet]]ary motion. It was propounded in the works entitled ''In Ismaelis Bullialdi astro-nomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis'' (Oxford, 1653), against the cosmology of [[Ismael Boulliau]], and ''Astronomia geometrica'' (London, 1656) on the system of [[Kepler]].<ref>http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages/11-ResearchProjects/boulliau/06rp-b-a-bio.htm</ref> About this time he was engaged in a [[Hobbes-Wallis controversy|philosophical controversy]] with [[Thomas Hobbes]], in fact a small part of the debate with John Webster launched by the ''Vindiciae academiarum'' he wrote with [[John Wilkins]] which also incorporated an attack on [[William Dell]].<ref>[[Allen G. Debus]], ''Science and Education in the Seventeenth Century: The Webster-Ward Debate'' (1970).</ref>

He was one of  the original members of the [[Royal Society of London]]. In 1659 he was appointed President of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], but not having the statutory qualifications he resigned in 1660.

==Churchman==

King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] appointed him to the livings of [[St Lawrence Jewry]] in [[London]], and [[Uplowman, Devonshire]], in 1661. He also became dean of [[Exeter Cathedral]] (1661) and rector of [[St Breock]], Cornwall in 1662. In the latter year he was consecrated [[Bishop of Exeter]], and in 1667 he was translated to the [[see of Salisbury]]. The office of Chancellor of the [[Order of the Garter]] was conferred on him in 1671.

In his diocese he showed great severity to [[nonconformist]]s, and rigidly enforced the act prohibiting [[conventicle]]s. He spent a great deal of money on the restoration of the cathedrals of [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]]. He died at [[Knightsbridge]] on [[6 January]] [[1689]].
