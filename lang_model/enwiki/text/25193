The 158th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]], an annual [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]], took place on 7 April 2012. Despite Cambridge having the heavier crew, Oxford were pre-race favourites having had a successful preparation period, including a victory over [[Leander Club|Leander]].  Cambridge won the toss and chose to start on the Surrey side of the river. Partway through, with the boats level, the race was temporarily halted to avoid injury to protester Trenton Oldfield, who swam in front of the two crews.  After the race was restarted, one of the Oxford crew suffered irreparable damage to his [[Blade (rowing)|blade]] following a clash of oars with the Cambridge boat, ending Oxford's chances of victory.  The race was eventually won by Cambridge by four-and-a-quarter lengths, in a consolidated time of 17 minutes 23 seconds. 

Immediately after completing the race, a member of the Oxford crew collapsed, but later recovered.  Oldfield was later jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance, and as a result of the disruption, security for subsequent Boat Races was increased.   The reserve race was won by Oxford's Isis in a record time, while the [[Women's Boat Race]] was won by Cambridge.

Oxford's reserve boat held a half-length lead by the Mile Post, and extended their lead to over a length by [[Hammersmith Bridge]].

The race was restarted some thirty minutes later, after Garrett had been satisfied that both crews were located as close as possible to where the disruption took place, in rough water caused by the flotilla following the race. Within a minute of the restart, the crews drifted together, causing a clash of oars which resulted in Oxford's number six, Hanno Wienhausen, losing his blade.<ref name=race/>  This effectively ended the race as a contest, as Cambridge rowed away from Oxford to win by four-and-a-quarter lengths.<ref name=racereport/>  Cambridge's winning time was recorded by finish judge Ben Kent as 17 minutes 23 seconds, the consolidation of the times that the crews actually rowed.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/statistics | title = Statistics | accessdate = 16 July 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Ltd}}</ref>
