'''Mark Hunter Richardson''' (born [[11 June]] [[1971]], [[Hastings, New Zealand]]) is a former [[New Zealand]] [[cricket]]er. He was a left handed opening batsman. He represented [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 38 Tests from 2000 to 2004. During his cricketing career he played for [[Auckland Aces|Auckland]], [[Buckinghamshire County Cricket Club|Buckinghamshire]] and [[Otago Volts|Otago]].  His nickname, "Rigor", is short for [[Rigor Mortis]], given to him on account that he moved like a dead man<ref>Rigor Chips Away, Chloe Saltau, 2004 http://www.beigebrigade.co.nz/loop/loop1101671589.html</ref>. He was also known as "snail man" due to his slow running. Although his team mates called him this in playful tones, he told [[3 News]] he had had a "guts full" of it.

Richardson began his career as a [[left arm orthodox spin|left-arm spinner]], batting at number 10. As his bowling ability declined, he worked on developing his batting, to the point where he was selected as an opening batsman for New Zealand, at age 29. His dour approach to batting provided vital stability to New Zealand's batting order.

Richardson scored 2776 Test runs at an average of 44.77, including four centuries and 19 fifties. His sole Test wicket came in a match against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in 2001, dismissing [[Mohammad Yousuf]], then known as Yousuf Youhana, caught and bowled for 203.

In addition to his slow running, Richardson was also noted for developing (in conjunction with the [[Beige Brigade]]) a tradition to challenge the slowest runner of the opposing side to a running race at the conclusion of each tour. In his first race he beat [[Australian cricket team|Australia's]] [[Darren Lehmann]]. He has since raced Pakistan [[leg-spin]]ner [[Danish Kaneria]], [[South African cricket team|South Africa]]'s [[Neil McKenzie]] and [[England cricket team|England]]'s [[Ashley Giles]], only beating Kaneria. The Beige Brigade also supplied Richardson with a long-sleeved and hooded running suit in the New Zealand teams 1980's beige and brown colours.

Famously Richardson caught Australian leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]] who was on 99 at the time.

He retired from all forms of cricket in December 2004, saying he could not sustain the intensity needed to compete at international level. He noted that he finished with "a Test bowling average that is better than [[Sir Richard Hadlee]]'s (22.29), and a 50-50 record in the end-of-series running race." He scored 9,994 first-class runs during his career, which he noted was "only different from Donald Bradman's batting average by a decimal point" (Bradman finished his career with an average of 99.94).

Richardson also played for [[Dunedin Metropolitan cricket team|Dunedin Metropolitan]] in the [[Hawke Cup]].

Richardson is a currently a cricket commentator for [[SKY Network Television|SKY Sports]].  He also co-hosts [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime]] show, [[The Crowd Goes Wild]], with [[Andrew Mulligan]], and is a presenter for [[Radio Sport]].
