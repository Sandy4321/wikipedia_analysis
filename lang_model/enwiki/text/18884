==Production==

===Conception===
In 2002, Fey was the head writer and a performer on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). She pitched the show that became ''30 Rock'' to NBC, originally as a sitcom about [[cable television|cable]] [[news broadcasting|news]]. NBC Entertainment president [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]] felt that "Fey was using the news setting as a [[Fig leaf#Metaphorical use|fig leaf]] for her own experience and [he] encouraged her to write what she knew."<ref name="dev_1">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535853,00.html|title=Do Not Adjust Your Set|first=James |last=Poniewozik|accessdate=October 16, 2007|date=September 18, 2006|publisher=[[Time (magazine)]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071009001021/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535853,00.html| archivedate= October 9, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an ''SNL''-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005<U+2013>2006 television season. Just before the deal went through, however, the show was nearly brushed aside by Anthony Lewis and Jack Melcher, two NBC executives who fought the idea, fearing that Fey's removal from ''SNL'' would result in a severe cut to the show's ratings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Eventually, Lewis gave in just a month before his retirement, and Melcher backed down. In May 2003, Fey signed a contract with NBC to remain in her ''SNL'' head writer position until at least the 2004<U+2013>2005 television season and to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal.<ref name="dev_2">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Schneider |title=Peacock updates ''SNL'' anchor's deal |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117885681.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=tina+fey+snl+2004%2D05 |work=Variety  |date=May 5, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Filming was postponed due to Tina Fey's pregnancy.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoINgNgCx3Q Interview: Tina Fey], ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|Adam Carolla Show]]'', October 25, 2006.</ref>

During the 2004<U+2013>2005 [[Television pilot#Pilot season|pilot season]], a pilot was announced named ''Untitled Tina Fey Project''. The ''30 Rock'' pilot focused on the boss of a variety show who has to manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both the stars as well as the show's new network executive.<ref name="dev_3">{{cite news |first=Josef |last=Adalian |coauthors=Schneider, Michael |title=Bruck finds ''Ring'' leader |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117917293.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |work=Variety  |date=February 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> ''30 Rock'' was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.<ref name="greenlit13eps">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Goldman |title=Upfronts Announcement: NBC's Schedule for 2006<U+2013>2007 Season |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/708/708855p2.html |publisher=IGN |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref>

The series underwent further changes during the months leading up to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from ''The Girlie Show'' would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com. The idea was to air the fictitious ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' online.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Consoli |coauthors=Berman, Marc |title=NBC Upfront: Unveils DotComedy.com; ''Kidnapped'', ''Studio 60'' Set for Fall |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502554 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612101404/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502554 |archivedate=June 12, 2007 |publisher=Mediaweek |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> This aspect of the series was abandoned prior to its debut.

===Filming===
Inside scenes for ''30 Rock'' are mostly filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, NYC (Studio 8H in 30 Rock in Manhattan for two live episodes).<ref name="filminglocations" /> In the episodes "Cleveland" and "Hiatus," [[Battery Park City, Manhattan]] and [[Douglaston, Queens]] doubled for [[Cleveland]], Ohio and [[Needmore, Pennsylvania|Needmore]], Pennsylvania, respectively.<ref name="cleveneedmorelocations">{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Webb Mitovich |title=Funny Business: Tina Fey Previews 30 Rock's Future |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/funny-business-tina/070612-02 |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 14, 2007}}</ref> In the episode "Gavin Volure," [[stock footage]] of the [[Arkansas Governor's Mansion]] was used for exterior shots of the home of [[Steve Martin]]'s character.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Gambrell |title=Arkansas Governor's Mansion Has "30 Rock" Cameo |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/26/governors-mansion-has-30_n_146578.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>

The title sequence is made up of photos and video of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and features the series regulars. The sequence ends with a time lapse of the building and then a title card reading '30 Rock'. The sequence has remained mostly the same throughout the series, although there have been changes to the videos of most of the actors.

===Music===

The series features a "jaunty" [[jazz]] [[sheet music|score]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston//RecRoom/47984-Uncertain-Fey-t/ |title=Uncertain Fey-t |accessdate=June 6, 2008 |last=Miliard |first=Mike |date=September 25, 2007 |publisher=The Boston Phoenix}}</ref> Most of the [[incidental music]] melody is played by either [[clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]], [[saxophone]], or [[String instrument|strings]], often as wildly varying renditions of the usual central theme. The music is composed by Fey's husband [[Jeff Richmond]], who is also a producer for ''30 Rock''.

The plot of ''30 Rock'' revolves around the cast and crew of the fictional [[sketch comedy]] series ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' (originally called ''The Girlie Show''), which is filmed in Studio 6H inside 30 Rockefeller Plaza.<ref name="plotreference" /> The series features an [[ensemble cast]].<ref name="nbcseriespress" /> The series features seven roles that receive star [[billing (film)|billing]] during the [[opening credits]]:

* [[Tina Fey]] as [[Liz Lemon]], the protagonist of the series and [[head writer]] of ''TGS with Tracy Jordan''
* [[Tracy Morgan]] as [[Tracy Jordan]], loose cannon, crazy, unpredictable, star of ''TGS''
* [[Jane Krakowski]] as [[Jenna Maroney]], Original star of "The Girlie Show", [[limelight]]-seeking co-star of ''TGS'' and Liz's natural blonde best friend
* [[Jack McBrayer]] as [[Kenneth Parcell]], a cheerful, obedient [[Southern United States|Southern]]-born [[NBC page]], who "lives for television," and whose age is never verified
* [[Scott Adsit]] as [[Pete Hornberger]], the "sane," quick-witted producer of ''TGS'', who serves as Liz's most trusted friend
* [[Judah Friedlander]] as [[Frank Rossitano]], a [[trucker hat]]-wearing, [[Puer aeternus|''manchildish'']], [[sarcastic]] writer at ''TGS''. His hat bears a different phrase in every episode
* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Jack Donaghy]], the decisive, controlling, suave and occasionally senseless network executive who constantly interferes with the goings-on at ''TGS''

Beginning with season two, three characters, who were credited as guest stars during season one, received star billing after the opening credits in addition to the principal cast:<ref name="nbcseriespress" />

* [[Katrina Bowden]] as [[Cerie Xerox|Cerie]], Liz's attractive, laid-back assistant, who usually wears revealing outfits to work, much to the delight of the writers' room.
* [[Keith Powell]] as [[James "Toofer" Spurlock]], the proud [[black people|black]] [[Harvard University]] alumnus writer, who often butts heads with Tracy and Frank.
* [[Lonny Ross]] as [[Josh Girard]], a young and immature ''TGS'' writer and co-star, known for his impressions. Ross was written out in season four.

Beginning with season three, three characters who were credited as guest stars in the first two seasons received star billing after the opening credits in addition to Bowden, Powell, Ross, and the principal cast. They are credited only in the episodes in which they appear:
* [[Kevin Brown (actor)|Kevin Brown]] as [[Characters_of_30_Rock#Dot_Com|Dot Com]], an erudite member of Tracy's entourage who is also a [[Wesleyan University]]-trained stage actor.  The character's real name is Walter Slattery.

* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as [[List of recurring characters on 30 Rock#Jonathan|Jonathan]], Jack's loyal and overprotective personal assistant, who at times appears to be possibly in love with Jack. Pauncholy left the show after season five and returned for season seven.

* [[John Lutz (television writer)|John Lutz]] as J. D. Lutz, a lazy, overweight TGS writer who is often insulted or made fun of by the rest of the staff.

[[Rachel Dratch]], Fey's longtime comedy partner and fellow ''SNL'' alumna, was originally cast to portray Jenna.

The show's cast and crew are outraged by this; especially head writer Liz Lemon and main actress Jenna Maroney. Jack proceeds to wreak havoc on ''The Girlie Show,'' forcing Liz to hire the off-the-wall movie star Tracy Jordan. He again angers the cast and crew of ''The Girlie Show'' when he changes the name to ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' (or just ''TGS'').

As the season progresses, the episodes become less about ''TGS'' and more about how the characters deal with juggling their lives and their jobs&nbsp;<U+2014>specifically the protagonist, Liz Lemon, but other characters are also explored. Episodes also become less self-contained and various story arcs develop in the second half of the season. For example, the first major story arc centers on Liz's relationship with [[Dennis Duffy]] ([[Dean Winters]]), "The [[Pager|Beeper]] King." Other story arcs include: Jenna promoting her movie ''[[The Rural Juror]]''; Tracy going on the run from the Black Crusaders; Jack's engagement, which was eventually called off, to a [[Christie's]] auctioneer named [[List of 30 Rock characters#Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[Emily Mortimer]]); and another relationship of Liz's with [[List of 30 Rock characters#Floyd DeBarber|Floyd]] ([[Jason Sudeikis]]).

Guest stars include [[Nathan Lane]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[LL Cool J]] and [[Ghostface Killah]].

The fourth season of ''30 Rock'' premiered on October 15, 2009. Like the previous season 3, it also consisted of 22 episodes. A recurring story arc early in the season revolved around Jack's request that Liz cast a new actor for ''TGS'', and Liz's subsequent search for the perfect comedian, much to the dismay of Jenna and Tracy, who fear losing their spotlight. The later half of the season focused on two complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between two mistresses, and Liz's inability to find a boyfriend to live up to her expectations and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator. The season has also featured such guest stars as [[Julianne Moore]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Cheyenne Jackson]], [[Sherri Shepherd]], [[Will Forte]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Michael Sheen]], [[Matt Damon]], and [[James Franco]].

For example, in its first year, there were 101 television series that were more highly rated.  The television season tends to begin in September, of any given year, and end during the May of the following year. "Viewers" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes (broadcast in the series' "Regular Timeslot") of ''30 Rock'' aired during the television season. Although the viewer average may be higher for some seasons than others, the rank will not necessarily be higher. This is due to the number of programs aired during primetime.

Similarly, the "Season finale" is the date that the final episode of the season aired.

===Similarities to other media===
Two shows debuting on [[2006-07 United States network television schedule|2006<U+2013>07 NBC lineup]], ''30 Rock'' and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', revolved around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. Similarities between the two led to speculation that only one of them would be picked up. Baldwin said "I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows. And ours has the tougher task, as a comedy, because if it's not funny, that's it."<ref name="newyorker">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_friend |title=Who's on First Dept: Shows about Shows |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |author=Friend, Tad |date=April 24, 2006|work=The New Yorker| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080911001913/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_friend| archivedate= September 11, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], then president of NBC Entertainment, was supportive of Fey, describing the situation as a "high-class problem":

{{cquote|I just can't imagine the audience would look at both shows, choose one and cancel the other out. In some ways, why is it any different than when there have been three or four cop shows on any schedule, or ''Scrubs'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which are tonally very different?<ref name="nytimesbid">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/arts/television/06fey.html?ei=5088&en=7f7d8807a835ac72&ex=1301976000&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print |title=Tina Fey's Brash Bid for Prime Time |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |author=Steinbery, Jacques |date=April 6, 2006 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>}}

Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when [[Aaron Sorkin]], the creator of ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'', asked [[Lorne Michaels]] to allow him to observe ''Saturday Night Live'' for a week, a request Michaels denied.<ref name="newyorker" /> Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with ''30 Rock''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/archives/105252.asp |title=Tina Fey's Weekend Update: Aaron Sorkin calls her out! |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |author=McFarland, Melanie |date=July 22, 2006|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5PqE41I68 | archivedate = June 24, 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref> Fey said that "it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]]. And then Trio got canceled."<ref name="newyorker" /> Fey wound up "beating" Sorkin when ''Studio 60'' was canceled after one season and ''30 Rock'' was renewed for a second. Though ''30 Rock''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of ''Studio 60'',<ref name="2006-07 primetime wrap" /> ''Studio 60'' was more expensive to produce.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/05012007/tv/studio_sinks__not_30_rock_tv_michael_starr.htm |title=''Studio'' Sinks, Not ''30 Rock'' |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |author=Starr, Michael |date=May 1, 2007 |work=New York Post}}</ref>

One early promo for ''30 Rock'' portrayed Alec Baldwin mistakenly thinking he would meet Sorkin,<ref>{{cite video |people=Tina Fey; Alec Baldwin |title=30 Rock Series Premiere Promo |url=http://30rockfan.org/media/videos/spot2.wmv |format=[[Windows Media Video|WMV]] |medium=Promo |publisher=[[NBC]] |accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref> and when asked on her "Ask Tina" space what she thought of the criticism that ''30 Rock'' received, Fey jokingly replied that people who did not like it were probably confusing it with ''Studio 60''.<ref>{{cite video |people=Tina Fey |title=Ask Tina&nbsp;<U+2013> 12/14/06 |url=http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/#mea=51031 |format=Stream |publisher=[[NBC]] |location=New York City, New York |accessdate=April 2, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080401235219/http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/| archivedate= April 1, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, none of ''30 Rock's'' producers have given ''Studio 60'' any serious criticism, positive or negative. In a November 1, 2006 interview, Fey said she had seen the first two episodes of ''Studio 60''. When asked what her impressions were, she jokingly replied, "I can't do [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]] of [[Bradley Whitford]] and [[Matthew Perry (actor)|Matthew Perry]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/54729 |title=Interviews: Tina Fey |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Murray |first=Noel |date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=[[The A.V.

At least five ''30 Rock'' episodes have briefly parodied ''Studio 60'':
* "[[Jack the Writer]]" contains a self-referring [[walk and talk]] sequence, such sequences being commonly used on ''Studio 60'' and Aaron Sorkin's previous shows.<ref name="tvguide">{{cite web |url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TV-Show-Blog/30-Rock/November-1-2006/700010940 |title=November 1, 2006: "Nuts to You, McGullicuty!" |accessdate=August 9, 2008 |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |date=November 2, 2006 |publisher=[[TV Guide]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080921163644/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TV-Show-Blog/30-Rock/November-1-2006/700010940| archivedate= September 21, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

* "[[Jack Meets Dennis]]"&nbsp;<U+2013> Liz says the upcoming show will be "worse than that time we did that Gilbert and Sullivan parody". The second episode of ''Studio 60'', "The Cold Open," included a parody of the "[[Major-General's Song]]" on the show-within-the-show.
* "[[The Fabian Strategy]]"&nbsp;- In the ending sequence Kenneth watches the credits for TGS, which include [[Ricky Tahoe|Ricky]] and [[Ron Oswald|Ronnie]] as writers, the two ex-head writers on ''Studio 60''.
* "[[Plan B (30 Rock)|Plan B]]" <U+2013> [[Aaron Sorkin]] appears as himself as Liz is attempting to get a new job at NBC's [[The Sing-Off]]. Sorkin explains to Liz that he, too, is having trouble finding work writing for television, despite having written such works as [[The West Wing]], [[A Few Good Men]], and [[The Social Network]]. Liz offers to add "Studio 60" to that list, but is told by Sorkin to "shut up."

Some critics have compared ''30 Rock'' to ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', with parallels drawn between the relationship of Liz and Jack and that of [[Mary Richards]] and [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20033306,00.html |title=There's 'Moore' to '30 Rock' Than Meets the Eye |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |date=April 2, 2007 |work=Entertainment Weekly| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5PqGbw4Di | archivedate = June 24, 2007| deadurl=no | first=Kera | last=Bolonik}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nwitimes.com/articles/2007/01/19/entertainment/entertainment/371a8d51218c1834862572660075efb8.txt |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5PqQuU6Xk |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |title=Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin help make '30 Rock' funny |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Moore |first=Frazier |date=January 19, 2007 |publisher=nwitimes.com}}</ref> It has also been compared to ''[[That Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1595332,00.html |title=Tina Fey |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Poniewozik |first=James |work=Time Magazine | date=May 3, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071226192701/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1595332,00.html| archivedate= December 26, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/10/11/jmer-10-11-06/ |title=30 Rock Brings New Energy to Television Comedy |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Martin |first=Ed |date=October 11, 2006 |publisher=[[Media Village]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111021121/http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/10/11/jmer-10-11-06/ |archivedate = November 11, 2007}}</ref> Like ''That Girl'' and ''Mary Tyler Moore'', ''30 Rock'' is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living in a big city where she works in the television industry.
