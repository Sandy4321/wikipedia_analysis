The '''Baltimore Pike''' was an [[auto trail]] in the [[United States]], connecting [[Baltimore, Maryland]], with [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Today, parts of the road are signed as [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 13 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 13]], and a small portion of [[Pennsylvania Route 41]]. A section of the road within the city limits of Philadelphia and surrounding [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|boroughs]] is known as '''Baltimore Avenue''', although locals are known to call the Delaware County portion "Baltimore Pike". In further western suburbs, some sections retain the formal name "Baltimore Pike."  Today, Baltimore Avenue's eastern terminus is at 38th Street in Philadelphia, where it intersects with Woodland Avenue (from [[Southwest Philadelphia]] and [[Darby, Pennsylvania|the borough of Darby]]) and funnels into University Avenue The road used to continue to [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]] until the [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] area was redeveloped.

==Route description==

===Maryland===
{{main|U.S. Route 1 in Maryland}}
The Baltimore Pike name is not currently used in [[Maryland]]. The routing of the Baltimore Pike in Maryland follows US 1 from [[Baltimore]] northeast to the Pennsylvania border near [[Rising Sun, Maryland|Rising Sun]] in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]]. The road passes through [[Bel Air, Maryland|Bel Air]] and crosses the [[Susquehanna River]] on the [[Conowingo Dam]].<ref name=gmMD>{{google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=gay+street+and+north+avenue+baltimore&daddr=US-1+N%2FConowingo+Rd&hl=en&ll=39.499802,-76.306915&spn=0.513935,1.352692&sll=39.728974,-76.014233&sspn=0.029969,0.084543&geocode=FcDcVwIdiGtv-yknB-vWWgTIiTHwEIVuHzCrDg%3BFawaXgIdUNx3-w&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=h&z=10|title=overview of Baltimore Pike in Maryland|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Pennsylvania===

====Chester County====
The Baltimore Pike enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Maryland in [[West Nottingham Township, Pennsylvania|West Nottingham Township]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], with the southernmost part of the road in the state a part of [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|US 1]], which is a four-lane [[divided highway]] at this point. North of the Ridge Road intersection, US 1 becomes a [[freeway]] called the Kennett Oxford Bypass and Baltimore Pike continues northeast as a two-lane undivided road that dead ends near the US 1 freeway. The road heads through wooded areas with some homes, with an older alignment of the road known as Old Baltimore Pike looping to the west of the road. Baltimore Pike comes to the [[Herr's Snacks]] plant in the community of [[Nottingham, Pennsylvania|Nottingham]], at which point the alignments of both Baltimore Pike and Old Baltimore Pike are severed, with traffic having to head west and north along Herr Drive to access [[Pennsylvania Route 272|PA 272]]. A short distance to the east along PA 272, the alignment of Baltimore Pike resumes as a two-lane undivided road and runs north-northeast past a few businesses, crossing into [[East Nottingham Township, Pennsylvania|East Nottingham Township]]. The road curves northeast and passes through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residential and commercial development, running a short distance to the northwest of an [[East Penn Railroad]] line.

Electric-powered [[tram|trolleys]] began operating on the avenue on January 13, 1895.<ref name="route34">{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml |title= Studio 34's Eponymous Trolley, or, A Short History of Route 34 |publisher= Studio 34 Yoga |accessdate= May 1, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080522140603/http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml| archivedate= 22 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Today, the avenue is served by [[SEPTA Route 34]], which runs on Baltimore from the subway mouth at [[40th Street (SEPTA Subway<U+2013>Surface Trolley station)|40th Street]] to the [[Angora Loop (SEPTA station)|Angora terminal loop]] at 61st Street.

==History==
[[File:PA-12 (1926).svg|88x70px|thumb|right|PA 12 (1924-1930)]]
Despite its name, the road was not itself a former [[Toll road|turnpike]], but portions were, including [[Baltimore and Jerusalem Turnpike]] between Baltimore and [[Bel Air, Maryland]]. The road's easternmost part was another such section: the Chaddsford Turnpike, depicted on an 1843 map running from [[Mill Creek (Philadelphia)|Mill Creek]] (present-day 43rd Street in West Philadelphia) to the western limits of Philadelphia County, in the direction of [[Chadds Ford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Chadds Ford Township]] in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="history">{{cite book |url= http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/wphila/history/history2.html |title= West Philadelphia: The Basic History |chapter= Chapter 2: A Streetcar Suburb in the City: West Philadelphia, 1854-1907 |author= West Philadelphis Community History Center |publisher=  University Archives of the University of Pennsylvania  |year= 2009 |accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>

Its northern section was renamed '''Pennsylvania Route 12''' in 1924.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |work= Highway History |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |first= Richard |last= Weingroff |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref> Much of the route was renamed [[U.S. Route 1]] in 1926.

Until 1928, the route crossed the [[Susquehanna River]] on the [[Conowingo Bridge]], which was destroyed and replaced by the [[Conowingo Dam]].

Baltimore Avenue formerly continued northward to [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]] as part of Woodland Avenue; this segment was stricken from the City street plan in the late 1950s due to redevelopment by the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and what is now [[Drexel University]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
