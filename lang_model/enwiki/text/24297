[[File:Marie Lloyd by Langfier Ltd.jpg|250px|thumb|<center>Marie Lloyd</center>]]
'''Marie Lloyd''' ([<U+02C8>m<U+0251><U+02D0>ri], rhyming with "starry";<ref>Gillies, p. 19</ref> born '''Matilda Alice Victoria Wood'''; 12 February 1870&nbsp;<U+2013> 7 October 1922) was an English [[music hall]] singer, comedienne and [[musical theatre]] actress during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was best known for her performances of songs such as  "[[The Boy I Love is Up in the Gallery]]", "[[My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)]]" and "[[Oh! Mr Porter|Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do]]".  She received both criticism and praise for her use of [[innuendo]] and [[double entendre]] during her performances, and enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the "Queen of the Music Hall". 

Born in London, she was showcased by her father at the Eagle Tavern in [[Hoxton]].  In 1884, she made her professional debut as Bella Delmere, before changing her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year.  In 1885, she had success with her hit song "The Boy I Love is Up in the Gallery", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].  In 1891, she was recruited by the [[impresario]] [[Augustus Harris]] to appear in that years spectacular [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] Christmas [[pantomime]] ''Humpty Dumpty''. She starred in a further two productions at the theatre including ''Little Bo Peep'' (1892) and ''Robinson Crusoe'' (1893).  By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqu<U+00E9> content of her songs.  

Between 1894 and 1900, she became an international success when she toured France, America, Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act. In 1907, she assisted other performers during the [[Music Hall War of 1907|music hall war]] and took part in demonstrations outside theatres, protesting for better pay and conditions for performers.  During the First World War, in common with most other music hall artists, she supported recruitment into the armed services to help the [[war effort]] and toured hospitals and industrial institutions to help boost morale. In 1915, she performed her only wartime song "Now You've Got your Khaki On", which became a favourite among frontline troops. 

Lloyd had a turbulent private life that was often the subject of much press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her.  In later life, she was still in demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her renowned performance of "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which earned her an extended audience. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s.  In 1922, she gave her final performance at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.

On 9 May 1885, at the age of 15, Lloyd made her professional solo stage debut at the Grecian [[music hall]] (in the same premises as the Eagle Tavern),<ref name=GILLIES11>Gillies, p. 11</ref> under the name "Matilda Wood".<ref name=GILLIES16>Gillies, p. 16</ref>  She performed "In the Good Old Days" and "My Soldier Laddie",<ref name=GILLIES16/> which proved successful, and earned her a booking at the [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] music hall in [[Old Street]] where she sang a series of romantic ballads.<ref>Gillies, p. 17</ref> Soon after this, she chose the stage name Bella Delmere<ref name="Gillies, p. 18">Gillies, p. 18</ref>{{#tag:ref|This stage name was spelled differently by various biographers, including Bella Delmare (by [[Naomi Jacob]]); Belle Delamere (by [[W.

Ware became her agent and,<ref name="Gillies, p. 18"/> after a few weeks, she began performing songs purchased from little-known composers.<ref>Pope, p. 37</ref> As her popularity grew, Ware suggested that she change her name. "Marie" was chosen for its "posh" and "slightly French" sound, and "Lloyd" was taken from an edition of ''[[Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper]]''.<ref name=DNB2/><ref name=Farson38>Farson, p. 38</ref> 

Lloyd established her new name on 22 June 1886,<ref name="Gillies, p. 18"/> with an appearance at the Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song "[[The Boy I Love is Up in the Gallery]]" (which was initially written for [[Nelly Power]] by Lloyd's agent George Ware).<ref name=Farson38/> By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular that she was in demand in London's [[West End theatre|West End]],<ref name=VandA/> including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at [[Skirt dance|skirt dancing]].<ref>Pope, p. 39</ref> George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in [[Bermondsey]].

By the end of 1886, Lloyd was playing several halls a night<ref>Farson, p. 39</ref> and earned <U+00A3>100 per week. She was now able to afford new songs from established music hall composers and writers,<ref>Pope, p. 40</ref> including "Harry's a Soldier", "She Has a Sailor for a Lover",  and "Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea".{{#tag:ref|"Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea", was written in 1889 by Tom Maguire.

While appearing at the Foresters music hall in [[Mile End]], she met and began dating Percy Charles Courtenay,<ref>Pope, p. 56</ref> a ticket [[tout]] from [[Streatham]], London.  The courtship was brief, and the couple married on 12 November 1887 at [[St John the Baptist, Hoxton]].{{#tag:ref|On the marriage certificate, Courtenay gave his profession as a captain in the British army.

In October 1888, Lloyd  returned from maternity leave and joined rehearsals for the 1888<U+2013>89 pantomime ''The Magic Dragon of the Demon Dell; or, The Search for the Mystic Thyme'', in which she was cast as Princess Kristina.  The production, which was staged between [[Boxing Day]] and February at the Britannia theatre in Hoxton, gave her the security of working close to home for a two-month period.  The engagement also gave her much-needed experience of playing to a big audience.<ref>Gillies, pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> The following year, she appeared at more Bohemian venues including the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] and the [[Alhambra Theatre|Alhambra]] theatres, the [[London Trocadero|Trocadero Palace of Varieties]], and the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Royal Standard playhouse]].<ref>Gillies, p. 40</ref> In 1889, she gave birth to a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child, which further damaged her marriage.<ref>Gillies, p. 41</ref>

[[File:Leicester-square-1874-iln.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Alhambra Theatre]], Leicester Square]] 
By the start of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a successful catalogue of songs, which included "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday house-hold objects. Her biographer and theatre historian [[W. J. MacQueen-Pope]] described the song as being "blue" and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head."<ref name="POPE68-69">Pope, pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref>  Similar-styled songs followed; "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train.  This was followed by "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do";<ref name="POPE68-69"/> "Oh You Wink the Other Eye"<ref>[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/pdf/O1243530/then-you-wink-the-other-sheet-music-w-t-lytton/ Sheet music - Then You Wink The Other Eye], Victoria and Albert Museum website, accessed 26 March 2013</ref> and "Twiggy Vous"<U+2014>a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad.<ref name="POPE68-69"/> After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage.  Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself as a member of the French government. He confirmed to her that "Twiggy Vous" was "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news.<ref>Pope, p. 72</ref>  At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime ''Cinderella'' in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.<ref>Gillies, pp. 129<U+2013>130</ref>

Between 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was recruited by the [[impresario]] [[Augustus Harris]] to appear alongside Dan Leno in the spectacular and popular [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] Christmas [[pantomimes]].{{#tag:ref|Walter Macqueen-Pope called Lloyd a Principal Girl and noted that "There is often a misconception about this and a belief that she was Principal Boy there.

Secretly, she was thrilled with the offer,<ref name="GILLIES53"/> for which she would receive <U+00A3>100 per week. The pantomime seasons lasted from Boxing Day to March<ref name=Farson45>Farson, p. 45</ref> and were highly lucrative, but Lloyd found working from a script restrictive.<ref>Pope, pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref>  Her first role was Princess Allfair in ''Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One'',<ref name=GILLIES53>Gillies, p. 53</ref> which she dismissed as being "Bloody awful, eh?"<ref name="Farson, p. 46">Farson, p. 46</ref> She received mixed reviews for her opening performance.

As a boy, the writer [[Compton Mackenzie]] was taken to the show's opening night and admitted that he was "greatly surprised that any girl should have the courage to let the world see her drawers as definitely as Marie Lloyd."<ref>Compton Mackenzie's memoirs, p. 232, as quoted in Gillies, p. 56</ref> 

Lloyd's biographer [[Midge Gillies]] defines 1891 as being the year that she officially "made it" thanks to a catalogue of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; ''The Era'' called her "the favourite of the hour".<ref>Gillies, p. 58</ref><ref>"Miss Marie Lloyd at the Oxford", ''The Era'', 12 September 1891, p. 3</ref> During the summer months, she toured North England, including [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]].

Lloyd made her American stage debut in 1893, appearing at [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] in New York.  She sang  "Oh You Wink the Other Eye", much to the delight of her American audiences. Other numbers were  "After the Pantomime" and "You Should Go to France and See the Ladies Dance", which both required her to wear provocative costumes.<ref>Gillies, pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref> Her performances pleased the theatre proprietors, who presented her with an antique tea and coffee service.<ref name=ERA2/>{{#tag:ref|The inscription on the service read: "Marie Lloyd from Koster and Bial, Friday December 12, 1890, New York."

In May 1894, Courtenay followed Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, where she was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: "I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!"

As a result of the incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal.<ref name=Farson42-43>Farson, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref>{{#tag:ref|After the incident, Lloyd and Burge travelled by horse and [[Brougham (carriage)|brougham]] to seek refuge at the Prince's tavern in [[Wardour Street]], which Lloyd had bought her family a few years before. When they arrived, Courtenay was again waiting by the rear door.  Courtenay shouted "I am going to murder you tonight.  I will shoot you stone dead and you will never go on stage anymore." Courtenay was restrained by Lloyd's uncle, and the couple fled once more.<ref>Farson, p. 43</ref>|group= n}} Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, [[Tufnell Park]]<ref>Gillies, p. 85</ref> and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her.  A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer [[Alexander Hurley]],<ref name="Western1"/>{{#tag:ref|Alexander Hurley was born in 1871 in Hackney and was the son of an Irish Sea captain.

On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in ''Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe''.  Her performance was praised by the press, who called her "delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed."<ref>''Liverpool Review'', 29 December 1894, as quoted in Gillies, p. 95</ref>

====Risqu<U+00E9> reputation and transatlantic tours====
[[File:Laura Chant in 1893.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Laura Ormiston Chant]]]]
By 1895, Lloyd's risqu<U+00E9> songs were receiving frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential [[feminist]]s. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career.<ref>Pope, p. 138</ref> The writer and feminist [[Laura Ormiston Chant]], who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes.  Her campaign persuaded the [[London County Council]] to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions.<ref>Farson, p. 64</ref><ref name=LMA1>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visiting-the-city/archives-and-city-history/london-metropolitan-archives/Documents/visitor-information/47-theatre-and-music-hall-sources-at-lma.pdf "Sources for the history of London Theatres and Music Halls at London Metropolitan Archives"], London Metropolitan Archives, Information Leaflet Number 47, pp. 4<U+2013>5, accessed 11 April 2013</ref> The screens were unpopular and were later pulled down by protesters, among whom was the young [[Winston Churchill]].<ref name="GILLIES315">Gillies, p. 315</ref><ref>Gillies, p. 89</ref> That November at the [[Tivoli Music Hall (London)|Tivoli theatre]], Lloyd performed "Johnny Jones", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend.<ref>Gillies, p. 101</ref> The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive thanks largely to the manner in which Lloyd sung it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience.  Social reformers cited "Johnny Jones" as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day.<ref name=GILLIES102>Gillies, p. 102</ref> Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal.<ref name=LMA1/> As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee.<ref>Pope, p. 140</ref>  She sang "Oh! Mr Porter" (composed for her by [[George Le Brunn]]), "A Little of What You Fancy"<ref name=dnb/> and "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas",<ref>Nuttall, Carmichael, p. 34</ref> which she retitled  "I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks" after some protest.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/8730911/The-BBC-should-see-thefunny-side-of-risque-humour.html "The BBC should see the funny side of risqu<U+00E9> humour"], ''The Telegraph'' (online edition), accessed 8 April 2013</ref> The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson's]] [[drawing-room]] ballad "Come into the Garden Maud" and displayed leers and nudges, to illustrate each innuendo.  The committee were left stunned at the performance,<ref>Pope, p. 141</ref> but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was "all in the mind".<ref name=dnb/>

[[File:Lloyd&Hurley.jpg|thumb|right|Lloyd with second husband [[Alexander Hurley]]]]
Despite their opposing views on music hall entertainment, Lloyd and Chant shared similar political views, and were wrongly assumed by the press to be enemies.<ref name=dnb/>{{#tag:ref|Chant's pressure for censorship was based on the [[Contagious Diseases Act]], which prevented the spread of [[venereal infection]] by allowing the police to arrest prostitutes and force them to undergo a medical examination. Chant was also a notable campaigner against [[domestic violence]], something that Lloyd herself would experience in all of her marriages.<ref name=dnb/>|group= n}} An inspector who reported on one of Lloyd's performances at the Oxford music hall thought that her lyrical content was fine but her knowing nods, looks, smiles and the suggestiveness in her winks to the audience suggested otherwise.<ref name=LMA1/> The restrictions imposed on the music halls were, by now beginning to affect trade, and many were threatened with closure.<ref>Farson, pp. 64<U+2013>65</ref> To avoid social unrest, Hackney council scrapped the licensing restrictions on 7 October 1896.<ref>Farson, p. 69</ref> In 1896, Lloyd sailed to South Africa with her daughter, who appeared as Little Maudie Courtenay on the same bill as her mother.<ref>Pope, p. 95</ref> Lloyd came to the attention of [[Barney Barnato]], a British entrepreneur who was responsible for [[randlord|mining diamond and gold]].  Barnato lavished gifts on her in an attempt to woo her, but his attempts were unsuccessful, and the two remained friends until his death in 1897.  The tour was a triumph for Lloyd, and her songs became popular among her South African audience. She performed "Wink the Other Eye", "Twiggy-Vous", "Hello, Hello, Hello",<ref name=FARSON77>Farson, p. 77</ref> "Whacky, Whacky, Whack!", "Keep Off the Grass",<ref>Pope, p. 93</ref> and "Oh! Mr Porter".  Feeling satisfied at the success she had achieved, Lloyd returned to London once the two-month tour had ended.<ref name=FARSON77/>

[[File:Marie Lloyd 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lloyd on stage in the 1890s]]
The following year, Lloyd travelled to New York where she re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song was about a young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; ''The Era'' observed that the line "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but turned out not to be so. ''The Era'' described the character as being "not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." Many other songs followed and were all warmly received.  At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures.<ref name=ERA3>"Marie Lloyd In New York", ''The Era'', 23 October 1897, p. 18</ref>  ''The Era'' commented that "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success".<ref name=ERA3/>  After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley.<ref name="Gillies, p. 124">Gillies, p. 124</ref> That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in [[Peckham]] in a production of ''Dick Whittington'' in which she played the title role. In it, she sang "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being "one of the pantomime songs of the year". ''The Music Hall and Theatre Review'' was equally complimentary, saying: "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!"<ref>Pope, pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref> During the Christmas period of 1898<U+2013>9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in ''Dick Whittington''.  The entertainment culminated with a song from [[Vesta Victoria]], and a short piece called ''The Squeaker'', starring [[Joe Elvin]].<ref>"Miss Marie Lloyd's Benefit", ''The Era'', 25 February 1899, p. 19</ref>

===1900s===
In February 1900, Lloyd was the subject of another benefit performance at the Crown Theatre in Peckham. [[Kate Carney]], Vesta Tilley and Joe Elvin were among the star turns who performed before the main piece, ''Cinderella'', which starred Lloyd, her sister Alice, Kittee Rayburn and Jennie Rubie.<ref>"Marie Lloyd's Benefit", ''The Era'', 17 February 1900, p. 18</ref> The same year, although her divorce was not yet finalised, Lloyd went to live with Hurley in [[Southampton Row]], London. Hurley, an established singer of [[Costermonger|coster]] songs, regularly appeared on the same bill as Lloyd; his calm nature was a contrast to the abusive personality of Courtenay.<ref>Farson, p. 79</ref> Lloyd and Hurley set sail for a tour of Australia in 1901, opening at [[Harry Rickards]] Opera House in Melbourne on 18 May<ref>Pope, p. 120</ref> with their own version of "The Lambeth Walk".<ref name=FARSON80>Farson, p. 80</ref>{{#tag:ref|The song was Hurley's version of the [[Cakewalk]], a popular dance craze at the time. "The Lambeth Walk" was not connected to the later [[Noel Gay]] hit.<ref name=FARSON80/><ref>Pope, p. 119</ref>|group= n}}  After the successful two-month tour, Lloyd and Hurley returned to London where she appeared in the only [[revue]] of her career. Entitled ''The Revue'', it was written by [[Charles Raymond]] and Phillip Yorke with lyrics by Roland Carse and music by Maurice Jacobi.  It was staged at the Tivoli theatre, in celebration of the Coronation of King Edward VII.<ref>Pope, p. 110</ref> Lloyd and Courtenay's divorce became absolute on 22 May 1905, and she married Hurley on 27 October 1906.<ref>Farson, p. 82</ref> Hurley, although ecstatic with his earlier success in Australia, began feeling sidelined by his wife's popularity. MacQueen-Pope suggested that "[Hurley] was a star who had married a planet.  Already the seeds of disaster were being sown."<ref name=FARSON81>Farson, p. 81</ref>{{#tag:ref|MacQueen-Pope wrongly assumed that the couple were married by 1901.<ref name=FARSON81/>|group= n}}

====Music hall strikes of 1907====
[[Image:1907 Music hall strike poster.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A poster for the 1907 ''Music Hall War'']]
Shortly after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to [[Bournemouth]] to recuperate from exhaustion.  Within days, however, she was back performing in London music halls.<ref>Gillies, p. 170</ref> From the start of the new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matin<U+00E9>e performances.  The first significant rift was a 1906 strike,<ref>Pope, p. 131</ref> initiated by  [[Charles Gulliver|The Variety Artistes' Federation]].<ref>Gillies, p. 171</ref> The following year, [[Music Hall War of 1907|the Music Hall War]] commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers.<ref>Pope, pp. 131<U+2013>132</ref> Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike,<ref>Farson, p. 83</ref> acted as a [[picket line|picket]] for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund.<ref>Pope, p. 132</ref> To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the [[Scala Theatre]]. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can." The singer was [[Belle Elmore]], later murdered by her husband, [[Dr. Crippen]]. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers.<ref name="Pope, p. 133">Pope, p. 133</ref> In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Ayr|Gaiety Theatre]] in [[Dundee]] where a critic for ''The Courier'' noted "Her bright smile and fascinating presence has much to do with her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style."<ref>"Marie Lloyd at the Gaiety", ''The Courier'', 30 March 1909, p. 7</ref>

====Relationship with Bernard Dillon====
[[File:Bernard Dillon Vanity Fair 12 September 1906.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bernard Dillon]]]]
Despite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American tour with Hurley in 1908. She was eager to equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously.  Lloyd enjoyed success every time she performed in North America.<ref name="Pope, p. 133"/> By 1910, her relationship with Hurley had ended, due in part to her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey [[Bernard Dillon]], winner of the 1910 [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]].<ref name=dnb/><ref name=FARSON85>Farson, p. 85</ref>{{#tag:ref| Dillon was born in 1888 in [[Tralee]], Ireland and moved to England at age thirteen, where he took up horse racing. Dillon met Lloyd at one of her parties in 1910, having been invited by Marie Jr.<ref name=FARSON85/>|group= n}}  Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair.  For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, and when she did perform, it was not to the best of her abilities.<ref>Gillies, p. 216</ref>  The writer [[Arnold Bennett]], who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he "couldn't see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd" and accused her songs of being "variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness."<ref>Bennett, p. 356</ref> As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd's elaborate and sociable lifestyle.<ref>Gillies, p. 222</ref> Dillon's success on the racecourse was short lived.<ref name="GILLIES232-33">Gillies, pp. 232<U+2013>233</ref> In 1911, he was expelled from the [[Jockey Club]] for borrowing <U+00A3>660 to bet on his own horses to win.<ref>"Mr Dillon's debt", ''The Times'', 6 June 1913, p. 5</ref> Dillon's horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers.<ref name="GILLIES232-33"/> He became jealous of Lloyd's successful life in the spotlight.<ref>Gillies, p. 233</ref>  Depression led to drink and obesity, and he started to abuse her.<ref>Farson, p. 87</ref>  Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which had also caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career.<ref>Farson, pp. 86<U+2013>87</ref> Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to [[Golders Green]]<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/printArticlePdf/5396390/3?print=n "A Jockey Divorced"], ''The Advertiser'', 19 December 1913, p. 11</ref> with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being "the worst thing she ever did."<ref>Pope, p. 151</ref>

===Later years===
A new show in London in 1912 showcased the best of music hall's talent.<ref>Pope, p. 143</ref>  The [[Royal Variety Performance|Royal Command Performance]] took place at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London, which was managed by [[Alfred Butt]].<ref>Farson, p. 93</ref> The show was organised by [[Oswald Stoll]], an Australian impresario who managed a string of [[West End of London|West End]] and provincial theatres.  Stoll, although a fan of Lloyd's, disliked the vulgarity of her act and championed a return to a more family-friendly atmosphere within the music hall.<ref>Farson, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref> Because of this, and her participation in the earlier music hall war, Stoll left her out of the line-up.<ref name=VandA/> He placed an advert in ''The Era'' on the day of the performance warning that "Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed&nbsp;... this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists".<ref>''The Era'' as quoted in Jacob, p. 93</ref> In retaliation, Lloyd staged her own show at the [[London Pavilion]], advertising that "every one of her performances was a command performance by order of the British public".<ref name=dnb/><ref>Pope, pp. 148<U+2013>149</ref> She performed "One Thing Leads to Another", "Oh Mr Porter", and "The Boy I Love is up in the Gallery" and was hailed as "the Queen of Comedy" by critics.<ref>Farson, p. 96</ref> The same year, she travelled to [[Devon]] where she appeared at the Exeter Hippodrome to much success. ''The Devon and Exeter Gazette'', reported that Lloyd's performance of "Every Movement Tells a Tale", was "thoroughly enjoyed" by the audience and "[received] round after round of applause".  The paper also praised her recital of a "Cockney girl's honeymoon in Paris", which was met by "roars of laughter".<ref>"Marie Lloyd At Exeter Hippodrome", ''The Devon and Exeter Gazette'', 27 August 1912, p. 10</ref>

====Scandal in America====
In 1913, Lloyd was booked by the Orpheum Syndicate to appear at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|New York Palace Theatre]]. She and Dillon set sail on the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon<ref>Farson, p. 98</ref> and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided in the country for many years.<ref name=Courier1>"Miss Marie Lloyd Is Ordered to Be Deported From America", ''The Courier'', 3 October 1913, p. 5</ref> Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the authorities found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of [[moral turpitude]]<ref>Farson, p. 99</ref> and were sent to [[Ellis Island]] while an enquiry took place.<ref>"The Detention of Miss Marie Lloyd and Dillon", ''Derby Daily Telegraph'', 4 October 1913, p. 5</ref>  Dillon was charged under the [[Mann Act|White Slave Act]] with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent.<ref name=dnb/>  After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914.<ref>Farson, p. 101</ref>  Alice later stated that "the indignity of the subsequent experience [while in custody] went to Marie's heart in a way she never survived.  She could not bear to talk of that awful twenty-four hours."<ref>"My sister Marie Lloyd", ''Lloyds Sunday News'', 10 December 1922, p. 4</ref> 

[[File:Edward F Albee 1857 1930 USA.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward Albee]], the organiser of Lloyd's final trip to America]]
Despite the problems, the tour was a success, and Lloyd performed to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs "The Tiddly Wink", "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, partly due to the Americanisation of each song's lyrics.<ref>Gillies, p. 242</ref> On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon.  The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, [[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward Albee]], who threatened her with a breach of contract action.  She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position.<ref>Gillies, p. 243</ref> The theatrical press were not convinced. The ''New York Telegraph'' speculated  "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition."<ref>''New York Telegraph'', 26 November 1913; as quoted in Gillies, p. 243</ref> Back in England, Hurley had died of [[pleurisy]] and [[pneumonia]] on 6 December 1913.<ref>Farson, p. 102</ref> Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying "until we meet again".<ref name=FARSON103>Farson, p. 103</ref>  However, she was reported in ''[[The Morning Telegraph]]'' as saying: "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends."<ref>The ''Morning Telegraph'', 1913 (full date not given); as quoted in Gillies, p. 245</ref> Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914,  the ceremony taking place at the British [[Consulate]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref>"Marie Lloyd Married", ''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advisor'', 23 February 1914, p. 7</ref> When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, "[I will] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered."<ref>''The New York Sun'', 4 October 1913, p. 3;  as quoted in Gillies, p. 240</ref>

Lloyd and Dillon returned to England in June 1914.<ref name="FARSON103"/>  Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, [[Aldershot]], [[Southend]], Birmingham and [[Margate]], and finished the summer season at the London Hippodrome.<ref>Gillies, p. 249</ref> She sang "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" and "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the latter of which had been received particularly well with her American audiences.  Within a fortnight, Britain was [[World War I|at war]], which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London's music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the [[war effort]].<ref>Farson, pp. 103<U+2013>104</ref> Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in [[Belfast]],<ref name="Gillies, p. 256">Gillies, p. 256</ref> where she interacted with wounded serviceman.  She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale,<ref>Farson, p. 104</ref> but received no official recognition for her work.<ref>Farson, p. 105</ref> During 1914, she scored a hit with "A Little of What you Fancy", which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point.  The song is  about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life's excitement herself.  During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she sits back and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.<ref>Gillies, pp. 257<U+2013>258</ref>

In January 1915, Lloyd appeared at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] where she entertained over ten thousand troops.  At the end of that year, she performed her only war song, "Now You've Got your Khaki On", composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier.  Lloyd's brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs "If You Want to Get On in Revue", which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and "The Three Ages of Woman", which took a cynical look at men from a woman's perspective.<ref>Gillies, p. 252</ref> She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in [[Northampton]], [[Watford]] and [[Nottingham]] in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley's death.<ref>Gillies, pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref> During the war years, Lloyd's public image had deteriorated.<ref name="GILLIES257"/> Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd's violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like "someone's mother, rather than their sweetheart."<ref name="GILLIES257"/> 

[[File:Marie Lloyd 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lloyd in her later years]]
In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted into the army, but disliked the discipline of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers,<ref>''The Times'', 29 July 1916, p. 18</ref> but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials that he was too obese to carry out military duties.<ref>Gillies, pp. 255<U+2013>256</ref>  On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions.  One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises.  When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband.<ref>Farson, p. 106</ref> By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife.  Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table.  Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour.<ref>"Marie Lloyd's Husband Gets Months Hard Labour for Assault on Police", ''The Evening Telegraph and Post'', 7 June 1917, p. 2</ref> Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse.  That year, she was earning <U+00A3>470 per week<ref name=FARSON116>Farson, p. 116</ref> performing in music halls and making special appearances.  The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, "[[My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)]]", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins.  The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man.<ref>Gillies, pp. 261<U+2013>262</ref>  The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London at the beginning of the 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.<ref>Farson, p. 54</ref> By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts,<ref name="GILLIES257">Gillies, p. 257</ref> and began feeling sidelined by her peers; [[Vesta Tilley]] had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty.<ref name="Gillies, p. 256"/>

In July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies compared Lloyd to a "talented old aunt who must be allowed to have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz or go to the Picture Palace".<ref>Gillies, p. 265</ref> She toured [[Cardiff]] in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning <U+00A3>11,000 a year.<ref name=FARSON116/> Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness.<ref name="GILLIES81">Gillies, p. 81</ref>{{#tag:ref|A family legend has it that one day Lloyd was met by a man who asked for an advance in order to help him with his new invention. She thought the request sounded too elaborate so declined to help, causing [[Guglielmo Marconi]] to look elsewhere. Stories of her spending included hiring an East End hotel so she could provide 150 beds for the area's homeless children; buying her family a hotel in [[Hastings]] and a pub in [[Soho]];<ref name= "GILLIES81"/> and buying two house boats on the Thames called ''Moonbeam'' and ''Sunbeam''.<ref name="Gillies, p. 124"/>|group= n}} Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of [[writ]]s from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family,<ref>Farson, pp. 116<U+2013>117</ref> resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.<ref name="FARSON116"/>

===Decline and death===

In 1920, Lloyd appeared twice at [[Hendon]] Magistrates Court and gave evidence of the abuse she had suffered from Dillon.<ref>Gillies, p. 268</ref>  Soon afterwards, she separated from Dillon and, as a result, became depressed.<ref name=dnb/>  When asked by [[Counsel|prosecutors]] how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied "I cannot tell you, there were so many [occasions].  It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk."<ref>Farson, p. 113</ref> By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage.  She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried in between shows. [[Virginia Woolf]] was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as "A mass of corruption <U+2013> long front teeth <U+2013> a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist <U+2013> scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing."<ref name="GILLIES271">Gillies, p. 271</ref>

In April 1922, Lloyd collapsed in her dressing room after singing "The Cosmopolitan Girl" at the Gateshead Empire in Cardiff. Her doctor diagnosed exhaustion, and she returned to the stage in August.  Her voice became weak, and she reduced her act to a much shorter running time.<ref name=FARSON118>Farson, p. 118</ref> Her biographer [[Naomi Jacob]] thought that Lloyd was "growing old, and [she] was determined to show herself to her public as she really was&nbsp;... an old, grey-faced, tired woman".<ref>Jacob, p. 199</ref> On 12 August 1921, Lloyd failed to show for an appearance at the [[London Palladium]], choosing instead to stay at home and write her will.<ref name="GILLIES271"/>{{#tag:ref|Lloyd left her brother John <U+00A3>300 and her maid <U+00A3>100. The rest was split between Lloyd's daughter and a group of Hoxton charities.<ref name="GILLIES271"/>|group= n}}

In the early months of 1922, Lloyd moved in with her sister Daisy to save money.<ref>Gillies, p. 272</ref> On 4 October, against her doctor's advice,<ref name=FARSON118/> she appeared at the Empire Music Hall in [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]], North London, where she sang "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit".  Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage.  Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act.<ref>Farson, pp. 119<U+2013>120</ref>  A week later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later, in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps.  She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52.{{#tag:ref|Lloyds death certificate diagnosed  "Nitral Regurgitation <U+2013> 14 months; Nephritis (an inflammation of the kidneys) <U+2013> 14 months; and Uraemic Coma <U+2013> 3 days."<ref>Farson, p. 121</ref>|group= n}}   More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at [[Hampstead Cemetery]] on 12&nbsp;October 1922.<ref name=NYT>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70B10FD3A5D14738DDDAA0994D8415B828EF1D3 "50,000 Mourn as Marie Lloyd is Buried"], ''The New York Times'', 13 October 1922, p. 16</ref><ref>"Marie Lloyd Buried", ''The Western Times'', 13 October 1922, p. 12</ref>{{#tag:ref|Six [[hearses]] were used to carry the flowers during the funeral procession.<ref name=NYT/>|group= n}}  Lloyd was penniless at the time of her death and her estate, which was worth <U+00A3>7,334<ref>"What Marie Lloyd Left", ''Evening Telegraph'', 8 November 1922, p. 7</ref> helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/oct/09/death-of-marie-lloyd "The Death of Marie Lloyd"], ''The Guardian'' (Archive), 22 October 1922</ref>

Writing in ''[[The Dial]]'' magazine the following month, [[T.S. Eliot]] claimed: "Among [the] small number of music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to what is called the lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection."<ref name="DIAL"/> Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was "going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some might call it heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment."<ref>Pope, p. 166</ref> The [[impersonator]] Charles Austin paid tribute by saying "I have lost an old pal, and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced."<ref>"Miss Marie Lloyd", ''The Sunday Post'', 8 October 1922, p. 1</ref>
