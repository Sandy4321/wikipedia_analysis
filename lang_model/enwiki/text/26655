'''Patricia Janet, Baroness Scotland of Asthal''', [[Privy Counsellor|PC]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (born 19 August 1955) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[barrister]], and served in many ministerial positions within the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]], most notably as the  [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] and [[Advocate General for Northern Ireland]].

==Early life and career==
Baroness Scotland was born in the Commonwealth of [[Dominica]] as the tenth child of twelve. Her family moved to [[Walthamstow]] when she was two years old. She attended the [[Walthamstow School for Girls]]. She is a Roman Catholic.<ref>[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/f0000331.shtml ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> She was educated at [[Anglia Ruskin University|Mid Essex Technical College]] in Chelmsford where she pursued a London University (LLB) law degree in 1976 (in association with [[University College London]]). She was called to the [[Bar association|bar]] at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1977, specialising in family and children's law. Baroness Scotland made history in 1991 by becoming the first black woman to be appointed a [[Queen's Counsel]]. She later founded 1 Gray's Inn Square barristers chambers.<ref name="thelawyer.com">{{cite web|author=28 June 2007 |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/baroness-scotland-qc-appointed-attorney-general/126857.article |title=Baroness Scotland QC appointed attorney general &#124; News |publisher=The Lawyer |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> Early in 1997 she was elected as a [[Bencher]] of the [[Middle Temple]]. Scotland was named as a Millennium Commissioner on 17 February 1994, and was a member of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]]. She received a [[life peerage]] on a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] list of working peers in 1997.

==Government Posts==
From 1999 to 2001 Baroness Scotland was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] where she was inter alia, responsible for the UK Government's diplomatic relations with [[North America]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Overseas Territories]], [[Consular Division]], [[British Council]], administration and all Parliamentary business in the [[House of Lords]]. Baroness Scotland notably introduced the [[International Criminal Court Act 2001|International Criminal Court Bill]] which sought to ratify the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]] into UK law. She established the [[Pro Bono Lawyers Panel]], a panel of British-based lawyers who provided legal advice on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis to United Kingdom nationals imprisoned in foreign countries. She created an Overseas Territories Council for the Caribbean and reformed and restructured the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Consular Division to be able to respond more effectively to emergencies and disasters abroad such as the [[11 September attacks]].

In 2001 she became Parliamentary Secretary, [[Lord Chancellor's Department]], and was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]. She was the Minister responsible for civil justice and the reform of civil law including the comprehensive reform of land registration leading to the [[Land Registration Act 2002]]. She was also responsible for international affairs at the Lord Chancellor<U+2019>s Department and was appointed by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] as the UK Alternate Representative to the European Convention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/patricia-scotland/26608 |title=Baroness Scotland of Asthal |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> and was given primary responsibility for the negotiations in relation to the Charter of Rights which were successfully concluded in 2003. During this period she consolidated the strong relations created with all the applicant countries through the FAHR programme and the Member States and was subsequently awarded the Polish Medal for her contribution to the reform and development of Law in Poland.

Baroness Scotland was a contender for a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] position in 2003, when Prime Minister Blair reportedly considered appointing her [[Leader of the House of Lords]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1057438,00.html New Face of the Lords], The Guardian, 7 October 2003</ref>

In 2003 Baroness Scotland was made [[Minister of State]] for the Criminal Justice system and Law Reform at the [[Home Office]] and deputy to the Home Secretary. She served in that post until 2007 under three Home Secretaries: [[David Blunkett]], [[Charles Clarke]] and [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]]. Whilst at the Home Office she was responsible for major reform of the criminal justice system. She created the Office of Criminal Justice Reform<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/inside/org/dob/direct/ocjr.html |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Office for Criminal Justice Reform |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> which helped to create and support the National Criminal Justice Board and the Local Criminal Justice Board. Having acted as Chair, she then created three Alliances to reduce re-offending (Corporate, Civic and Faith based Alliance) and the Corporate Alliance against Domestic Violence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Blue Serif - Design & Marketing Services - matt@blueserif.co.uk |url=http://www.caadv.org.uk/ |title=Corporate Alliance Against Domestic Violence |publisher=CAADV |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> She created an advisory group on victims and the Criminal Justice Centre, Victims and Witness units.

Baroness Scotland created Inside Justice Week<ref>[http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement171008a.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> and the Justice Awards. She introduced the Crime and Victims Act which created new offence of familial homicide which was successfully used to prosecute the killers of Baby P who would otherwise have escaped responsibility for his death. By 2009, domestic violence in the UK had been reduced by 64%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/media/press_releases/domestic_violence_drop.aspx |title=Home Office |publisher=Equalities |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> The domestic violence homicide rate had been significantly reduced and crime was at its lowest since 1991.

Baroness Scotland continued her responsibility for international affairs at the Home Office and continued to represent the UK in a number of difficult and challenging international negotiations such as those relating to extradition.

In 2004 Baroness Scotland was considered to be a possible candidate to become a Commissioner of the [[European Union]].

During her time as Attorney General, Baroness Scotland continued to promote [[pro bono]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/AttorneyGeneralWelcomesProBonoProgress.aspx |title=Attorney General Welcomes Pro Bono Progress |publisher=Attorneygeneral.gov.uk |date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> work by lawyers and created an international and Schools Pro Bono Committee which was responsible for co-ordinating pro bono work.

==NatWest Three==
A new [[extradition treaty]] with the [[United States of America]] had been signed on 31 March 2003. Baroness Scotland had the responsibility for promoting the necessary legislation in the House of Lords.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=iain%20duncan%20smith&ALL=Iain%20Duncan%20Smith&ANY=&PHRASE=&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=muscat_highlighter_first_match&URL=/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060712/debtext/60712-0889.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match Extradition Debate] Hansard, 12 July 2006</ref> The "[[NatWest Three]]" extradition case made use of this treaty. The three men were British citizens, living in the UK and working for the [[Royal Bank of Scotland Group]], a British bank. On 12 July 2006, in a highly unusual move, the Speaker of the House, [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]], allowed an emergency debate on both the treaty and the NatWest Three after a request by Liberal Democrat [[frontbencher]] [[Nick Clegg]].

During the debate, Baroness Scotland's view in 2005 that a higher threshold to establish "probable cause" was required by the UK to extradite from the US than vice versa was contrasted by Clegg to comments which the Prime Minister had made in July 2006, in which he stated that the evidential burdens on the two countries were the same.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=baro%20scotland&ALL=Baroness%20Scotland&ANY=&PHRASE=&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=muscat_highlighter_first_match&URL=/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060712/debtext/60712-0887.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match Extradition Debate] Hansard, 12 July 2006</ref> The 'NatWest Three' were subsequently extradited, and accepted a [[plea bargain]] arrangement under which they pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud in the United States.

==Illegal immigrant employment controversy==
In 2009 Baroness Scotland was the victim of a fraud perpetrated by Lolo Tapui, an illegal immigrant. Ms Tapui had been using a forged passport for the period up to and including December 2008. Baroness Scotland began to employ Ms Tapui in January 2009. Ms Tapui was later jailed for eight months for fraud, possessing a false identity stamp, and overstaying her UK visa. At her trial Ms Tapui confessed to having been paid <U+00A3>95,000 by the Daily Mail. She was later deported. <ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/latest/2010/05/27/baroness-scotland-s-cleaner-jailed-115875-22290170/</ref>
