'''''Horrible Histories''''' is a British children's sketch comedy television series, part of the [[Horrible Histories|children's history franchise]] of the same name based on the books written by [[Terry Deary]]. The show was produced for [[CBBC]] by [[Lion Television]] with Citrus Television and ran from 2009 to 2013 for five series{{#tag:ref|''Series'', in this context, is the British equivalent of the American television ''season''.|group=note}} of thirteen half-hour episodes, with additional one-off seasonal and Olympic specials.

The TV show carries over the graphic style and much of the content of the [[Horrible Histories (book series)|''Horrible Histories'' book series]]. It maintains the franchise's overall irreverent but accurate focus on the dark, gruesome or scatological aspects of British and other [[Western world]] history, spanning from the [[Stone Age]] to the post-[[WWII]] era. Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. [[Live-action]] sketches<U+2014>which often parody other UK media or celebrities<U+2014>and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes. The starring troupe are [[Mathew Baynton]], [[Simon Farnaby]], [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Jim Howick]], [[Laurence Rickard]] and [[Ben Willbond]], alongside a large supporting cast headed by [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Lawry Lewin]] and [[Dominique Moore]]. The black rat puppet "host", Rattus Rattus, appears in short bridging segments, explaining the factual basis for each sketch.

The creative team was largely recruited from the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as ''[[Blackadder]]'' and the [[Monty Python]] films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.

In 2011, a spin-off game show, ''[[Horrible Histories: Gory Games]]'', was launched on CBBC. In the same year, the original show was repackaged for main channel [[BBC One]] as ''[[Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry]]'', with [[Stephen Fry]] replacing the puppet rat as presenter.

==Background==

''Horrible Histories'' is based on [[Horrible Histories (book series)|the UK children's historical-comedy book series]] by [[Terry Deary]], first published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic UK]] in 1993 and since expanded into a [[Horrible Histories|multimedia franchise]]. The books and subsequent spin-off materials are intended to pique young children's interest in history via short, factually based but humorously told anecdotes highlighting aspects of the subject not usually covered in more traditional educational sources.<ref name="scanlon">{{cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13614541.2010.540197 | title=History beyond the academy: humor and horror in children's history books | work=New Review of Children's Literature and Librarianship, 16:2, 69<U+2013>91|year=2011| accessdate=21 March 2014 | author=Scanlon, Margaret}}</ref>

LionTV executive producer Richard Bradley, whose company had previously produced several adult history-themed programmes and whose son was a fan of the ''Horrible Histories'' books, was the initial driving force behind a new TV adaptation.<ref name="guardian_a">{{cite web|author=Hickman, Leo |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/mar/17/horrible-histories-huge-hit |title=How Horrible Histories became a huge hit|work=The Guardian |date=17 March 2011|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Deary was initially sceptical, having had a negative experience with the [[Horrible Histories (2001 TV series)|2001 animated series]], which had only loosely incorporated his concept. He finally agreed to the new project on the condition that it be explicitly "horrible, funny and true". While disclaiming any active role in developing the subsequent series, he would eventually contribute to the writing as well as appearing in several small roles.<ref name="guardian_a" />

The producers were likewise determined that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director [[Dominic Brigstocke]] concluded that the material was strong enough to stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase.<ref name="guardian_a" /> Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.<ref name="bcg_a">{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/about/ | title=About: Horrible Histories | work=[[British Comedy Guide]] | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>

To do the material full justice, Brigstocke and series producer Caroline Norris used their industry contacts to put together a creative team consisting mostly of veterans of the adult UK comedy community.<ref name="bcg_a" /><ref name="telegraph_a"/> The BBC readily agreed to this cross-demographic experiment. They also approved the adoption<U+2014>insofar as was possible in a programme aimed at young children<U+2014>of the core franchise precept of "history with the nasty bits left in",<ref name="telegraph2_a">{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9857326/Horrible-Histories-20-years-of-entertaining-children.html | title=Horrible Histories: 20 years of entertaining children |work=The Daily Telegraph | date=21 February 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2013| author=Preston, Richard}}</ref> which frequently involved "[[Gross out|gross-out]]"-style bodily function humour and comic violence.<ref name="guardian_a" /><ref name="telegraph_a"/>

The new creative team, while avoiding references aimed specifically at adults, was determined not to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material.<ref name="express_a">{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/249426/Horrible-Histories-A-funny-way-to-learn | title=Horrible Histories: a funny way to learn |work=[[The Daily Express|The Sunday Express]] |date=29 May 2011| accessdate=10 December 2013|author=Stephenson, David}}</ref><ref name="bbcint">{{cite web| title=Interview with Laurence Rickard and Mathew Baynton|work=[[BBC News]] | date=2 June 2010 | accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref><!-- No longer available on the BBC website.

Once the first series had aired and it was realised that the overall approach was working well, the creative team built on and significantly expanded the scope of the comedy elements for the second.<ref name="bcg_a"/><ref name="express_a" /> This trend continued through each subsequent series. The net result was a show that immediately appealed to young children while also gaining the increasing respect<U+2014>and viewership<U+2014>of older audiences.<ref name="bcgpress">{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/press/ | title='Horrible Histories' in the press |work=British Comedy Guide| accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref>

==Format==

{{Main|List of Horrible Histories episodes}}

The divisions by historical era or civilisation in the book series are carried over in the TV show, focusing on events in or directly affecting [[Great Britain]] and (to a lesser extent) the larger [[Western world]]. The [[Incan Empire|Inca]] and [[Aztec]] empires are also featured in later series.<ref name="popm_a"/> Sketches are grouped under these divisions, named as in the books, beginning with the Savage [[Stone Age]] and including among others the Awful [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], Groovy [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], Rotten [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Vicious [[Vikings]], Measly [[Middle Ages]], Terrible [[Tudor period|Tudors]], Gorgeous [[Georgian era|Georgians]] and Vile [[Victorians]]. The timeline for the most part ended at the Woeful [[Second World War]].<ref name="guardian_a" /><ref name="comedy"/> During the fifth and final series the show featured a handful of significant post-WWII (or "Troublesome Twentieth Century") events, including the civil rights movement and the [[Space Race]] between the US and the USSR. The most recent event referenced was the 1969 [[Apollo 11|Apollo 11 Moon landing]].<ref name="bfi5" />

[[File:Horrible Histories animated title cards.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Typical examples of the title cards with animated characters, based on the art style of the books, that introduced sketches]]

Each named division has its own title card that appears before each sketch (or group of sketches) set in that era or civilisation, along with a short introductory animation featuring a period-appropriate character. Throughout each sketch, small pop-up signs are used to affirm the truth (or otherwise) of any particularly implausible-seeming concepts mentioned onscreen.<ref name="popm_a"/> The live-action material is intercut with short animated sketches, quizzes and interludes with puppet "host" Rattus Rattus (performed by [[John Eccleston]]), who addresses the viewer directly as a presenter, commenting on and clarifying the factual basis behind the humour.<ref name="comedy">{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/ |title=Horrible Histories|work=British Comedy Guide|date= |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/horrible-histories | title=Review: Horrible Histories | work=[[Common Sense Media]]| accessdate=3 March 2014 | author=Ashby, Emily}}</ref>

Sketches were filmed ''en masse'' and then cut into episodes by the producers based on creative rather than chronological or other educational considerations, in the manner of a more traditional sketch-comedy series.<ref name="telegraph2_a" /><ref name="FULLSESSION"/> They often fall under a recurring banner<U+2014>usually with its own short title sequence<U+2014>but otherwise vary widely in length, visual style and approach. Many are recognisable parodies of other popular media or celebrities, in formats ranging from spoof commercials to mock TV shows, newscasts, magazines, video games and film trailers.<ref name="bcg_a"/> Notable parody inspirations included ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|Masterchef]]'', ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Wife Swap]]'', ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.<ref name="guardblog_a"/><ref name="guardreview"/> "Horrible Histories Movie Pitch", in which historical figures pitch their life stories to a panel of Hollywood producers played by ''[[The League of Gentlemen|League of Gentlemen]]'' actors [[Mark Gatiss]], [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], used the format of a commercial campaign for [[Orange (UK)#Orange Gold Spots|Orange mobile reminders]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/horrible-histories-cbbc-meets-royston-vasey-7621912.html | title=CBBC meets Royston Vasey | work=[[The Independent]] | date=6 August 2012 | accessdate=16 February 2014 | author=Kelly, Stephen}}</ref>

The show also created several popular recurring characters and concepts, notably "Stupid Deaths", in which a skeletal, platinum-blond [[Grim Reaper]] amuses himself while processing souls for admittance to the afterlife by forcing candidates from throughout history to relate the embarrassing details of their demise.<ref name="guardian_a" /><ref name="guardian3_a" /> HHTV News' Bob Hale and his eccentric-but-erudite in-studio reports provide a broader picture on historical events (such as the [[Wars of the Roses]] and the [[French Revolution]]), in a style reminiscent of presenter [[Peter Snow]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/home/digital-editions/broadcast-hot-100-2012/5056710.article | title=The Horrible Histories team | publisher=''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]''| work=Broadcast Hot 100 2012 supplement| date=23 May 2013 | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Parker, Robin, ed. | pages=17}}</ref><ref name="djsketches">{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/horrible-histories-jubilee-sketches-will-never-be-aired/5043199.article|title=''Horrible Histories'' Jubilee sketches will never be aired|work=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|author=Parker, Robin| date=11 June 2012|accessdate=17 February 2014|subscription=yes}}</ref> The "Shouty Man", a parody of a typically ebullient [[infomercial]] host, pitches unusual historical products.<ref name="bcg_a"/>

===Music===

Original music plays a significant role in the show and its popularity; "Music from ''Horrible Histories''" was chosen as the [[Horrible Histories Prom|2011 theme]] of the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]]' annual children's concert.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite web|author=Brogan, Benedict|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/proms/8674648/BBC-Prom-2011-Prom-20-Horrible-histories-Albert-Hall-review.html |title=BBC Prom 2011: Prom 20: Horrible Histories, Albert Hall, review |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> Alongside various short intro themes and commercial jingles, each episode{{#tag:ref|With the exception of Episode 5 of Series 1, produced before the music became a priority as described below.|group=note}} and each special contains at least one longer comedy song centred around a particular historical figure or theme and performed by the cast in appropriate character.<ref name="telegraph2_a" />

In the first series, the songs generally had no particular satirical slant, and were often intercut with sketches from the same era. However, after the creative team noted the critical and popular success of the major exception ("Born 2 Rule", which featured [[House of Hanover|King Georges I<U+2013>IV]] performing in the style of a [[boyband]]) the decision was taken from the second series onwards to continue in that vein.<ref name="express_a" /> Historical concepts were matched to a diverse range of modern musical references, and the results were showcased as self-contained music video parodies. The thirteenth episode of the second and each subsequent series was retooled as a "Savage Songs" special, featuring a compilation of that series' outstanding videos.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/episodes/ | title=Horrible Histories: Episode Guide| work=British Comedy Guide | accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>

The songs have since become among the most critically and popularly acclaimed elements of the show, especially among its adult audience. Commentators cite the apt cleverness of the various historical/musical parody match-ups, and the complexity and skill with which the musical elements are executed.<ref name="radiotimes" /><ref name="telegraph" /><ref name="radiotimes1">{{cite web|author=Seale, Jack|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-06-06/horrible-histories-5-brilliant-songs-from-series-5 |title=Horrible Histories: Five brilliant songs from Series 5|work=[[Radio Times]] |date=6 June 2013|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> Principal composer [[Richie Webb]] confirms that the songs became more sophisticated as a result of the show's increasing popularity with older viewers, as well as the demands of increased visibility online.<ref name="radiotimes1" /> Many of the videos have earned standalone popularity on YouTube.<ref name="telegraph2_a" />

The videos tend to run about three minutes, with two significant exceptions. "The English Kings and Queens", from the third series, lists all of the [[British monarchs]] since [[William the Conqueror]], using a [[Chas & Dave]]-inspired [[cumulative song|cumulative]] format.<ref name="radiotimes" />{{#tag:ref|Listen to an audio clip (uploaded by the composer) [https://soundcloud.com/richiewebb/horrible-histories-kings-and here]|group=note}} The creative team wrote the song to challenge the show's young audience, after noting that the same youngsters had been inspired to memorise lyrics to previous songs.<ref name="thism_a">{{cite web | title=Interview with Mathew Baynton, Jim Howick and Martha Howe-Douglas| work=[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]| date=12 April 2012 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref><!-- No longer available on the programme's website.

==Content and educational value==

No formal educational method was applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official [[UK National Curriculum]] for primary school history.<ref name="histex_a" /><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study | title=National curriculum in England: history programmes of study |work=Official United Kingdom government website | date=11 September 2013 | accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but<U+2014>in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise<U+2014>saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously.<ref name="telegraph2_a" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timeout.com/london/tv-reviews/yonderland-horribly-ever-after | title=Yonderland: Horribly ever after | work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|date=6 November 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013|author=Tate, Gabriel}}</ref><ref name="tbivision_a">{{cite web | url=http://tbivision.com/highlight/2013/11/kids-tv-seriously/185741/ | title=Kids TV, seriously | work=Television Business International | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref> The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter [[Dan Snow]].<ref name="guardian_a" /> Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', Gerard Gilbert notes that ''Horrible Histories'' is part of an extensive British [[Black comedy|black-comedy]] tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming.<ref name="independent">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/horrible-histories-the-best-laughs-are-on-childrens-tv-2194280.html?action=Email |title=Horrible Histories: The best laughs are on children's TV |work=The Independent |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2013|author=Gilbert, Gerard}}</ref> In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.<ref name="histex_a"/>

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="My aim for this was always that kids would go away and read up more about a subject. They love all the slapstick, but they also love what Terry does really well in the books<U+2014>telling you something your parents don<U+2019>t know. When you<U+2019>re eight years old you get told what to do by everyone, so being able to teach your dad something is amazing."|source=<U+2014>Caroline Norris, 2013<ref name="telegraph2_a"/>}}

Throughout, emphasis was placed on meshing comedy with the demands of historical accuracy, as defined by the mainstream scholarly consensus on the topic. This stance sometimes encompassed traditionally accepted if not actually well-documented anecdotes, such as those involving [[Caligula]].<ref name="FULLSESSION" /><ref name="histex_a" /> All the material used on the show was vetted by production assistant and self-described "tyrannical pedant" Greg Jenner during both writing and filming; he says that he has counted only eight errors out of more than 4,000 facts presented over the course of the show's run.<ref name="telegraph2_a" /> Costuming and makeup were likewise painstakingly recreated based on primary historical sources where available.<ref name="telegraph2_a" /><ref name="bfi5"/>

When an error was discovered, the effort was made to correct it whenever possible. This process is perhaps most noticeable in the evolution of a song featuring the four [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King Georges: lyrics in the original 2009 video incorrectly saying that [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] had "died on the [[Close stool|loo]]" were correctly re-assigned to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] for the song's reprise at the show's 2011 BBC Prom concert.<ref name="histex_a" />

Taking cues from what Deary describes as his "seriously subversive" attitude towards the mainstream British history education model<ref name="telegraph2_a" /> meant that the show inevitably incorporated sociopolitical comment. Perhaps most explicitly, Scots-Jamaican nurse [[Mary Seacole]] was deliberately championed in both a sketch and later song as a forgotten heroine in the shadow of [[Florence Nightingale]]. The activities of African-American activists [[Harriet Tubman]] and [[Rosa Parks]] were also showcased, as was ex-slave boxer [[Bill Richmond]].<ref name="histex_a" /> According to Norris, a desire to include more women's stories was hampered by the traditionally male-dominated viewpoint of historical records.<ref name="guardblog_a" /> The show did make an attempt to counteract this by giving showcase songs to the British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] movement and [[Home front during World War II#Mobilisation of women|women's work on the British homefront during WWII]], and wherever possible highlighting strong-willed, dynamic female figures, including [[Queen Victoria]], [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Boudicca]]. Religious controversies, class divisions, the ethics of conquest, and labour conditions have likewise been touched on.<ref name="guardian_a" />

The association with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, as they had demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects.<ref name="FULLSESSION" /> Senior writer [[Steve Punt]] said that there were in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that "everyone was very relieved".<ref name="telegraph_a" /> The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the [[Holocaust]] or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly.<ref name="express_a" /><ref name="histex_a" /> Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old.<ref name="FULLSESSION" /> While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers.<ref name="histex_a" /> The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the WWI [[Christmas truce]], for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.<ref name="guardblog_a"/>

==Production==

The TV series used the [[Horrible Histories]] brand, logo and associated trademarks under licence from publisher [[Scholastic Books]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Loveday, Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|title=Horrible Histories heading to TV|work=Licensing.biz |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref> It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television,{{#tag:ref|[http://citrustelevision.com/ Citrus Television] was formed by several of the ''Horrible Histories'' producers during the show's first series, and is credited alongside LionTV from the second series onward.|group=note}} with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately one year to produce. The process included several months of research into the historical facts, two to three months of writing, eight weeks of filming both on location and at London's [[Twickenham Studios]], and three to four months of post-production.<ref name="FULLSESSION">{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN5AjcqvPvA | title=Symposium: Horrible Histories: A Masterclass|author=Norris, Caroline; Farnaby, Simon; & Howe-Douglas, Martha | publisher=[[Edinburgh International Television Festival|MediaGuardian Edinburgh Television Festival]] 2012 |medium=YouTube|date=19 September 2012 | accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="express2_a">{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/315797/Horrible-History-s-a-hoot | title=Horrible history's a hoot | work=[[The Daily Express]]| date=22 April 2012 | accessdate=11 December 2013|author=Stephenson, David }}</ref>

At first the sketches were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable to the screen either as raw material or creative inspiration.<ref name="guardian_a" /> In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.<ref name="histex_a">{{cite web | url=http://d2j7noxmrt3xhh.cloudfront.net/bbchistory/audio/HistoryExtra_2013_05_30.mp3 | title=Podcast: Behind the scenes at Horrible Histories| work=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History]] |medium=mp3 podcast file|date=30 May 2013 | accessdate=12 December 2013|author=Hodgman, Charlotte }}</ref>

Inspiration for the music videos came from many different sources, and input from all members of the show's creative team was encouraged.<ref name="FULLSESSION"/><ref name="radiotimes1"/> With the exception of "A Gorgeous Georgian Lady", adapted by Deary from his book ''Gorgeous Georgians'', all songs were original to the series.

Each series debuted in the UK in April or May from 2009 to 2013, and on international channels including Canada's [[BBC Kids]] and Australia's [[ABC3]]. Six special episodes, comprising a mix of new and existing material around a single theme, were broadcast in the UK. "Horrible Christmas" (aired in 2010) was followed by a "Sport Special" (July 2012, to coincide with the [[2012 London Olympic Games]]) and a "Scary Special" (autumn 2012, themed around [[Halloween]]). "Ridiculous Romance" (themed around [[Valentine's Day]]) aired in February 2014; still to air later in the same year is a 40-minute special commemorating the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of [[WWI]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/episodes/2014/1/ | title=2014 Specials <U+2013> Horrible Histories | work=British Comedy Guide | date=23 January 2014 | accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="BCAspecials" />

The  producers decided to cease full-time production after the fifth series, citing concerns around the increasing difficulty in finding suitable historical material.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/402593/The-end-of-history-as-we-know-it | title=The end of history as we know it | work=[[The Daily Express|The Sunday Express]]| date=26 May 2013 | accessdate=26 December 2013 | author=Stephenson, David}}</ref> However, the possibility of further specials marking important historical or holiday milestones has been discussed, including the commemoration of the 800th anniversary of the signing of [[Magna Carta]] in 2015.<ref name="BCAspecials">{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001192/ |title=Horrible Histories to continue with specials|work=British Comedy Guide|date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>

===Cast===

The cast members were recruited from sketch and character comedy, having previously had roles in ''[[Gavin & Stacey]]'', ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and the TV series ''[[The Mighty Boosh (TV series)|The Mighty Boosh]]'', among others. Several of the writers and researchers also occasionally appeared in front of the camera, including Punt, Jenner, George Sawyer and Ben Ward, while actors [[Mathew Baynton]] and [[Ben Willbond]] sometimes contributed to the writing. [[Laurence Rickard]] was recruited solely as a writer, but found himself part of both the senior writing staff and starring cast after creating the character of Bob Hale, whose extended, convoluted monologues proved impossible to hand over to anyone else.<ref name="bfi4">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/live/video/920 |title=Horrible Histories Series Four BFI Q&A |publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=18 March 2012|accessdate=19 June 2013|author=Norris, Caroline with the starring cast}}</ref>

Individual sketches and songs were cast by the production team, sometimes acting on input from the show's stable of performers themselves. While certain roles naturally lent themselves to a particular actor, Norris said that confidence in the entire cast's ability was such that the producers also experimented with casting against type.<ref name="bfi4"/> The demands of filming thirteen episodes' worth of material in the same timeframe as a standard six-episode sketch show, while coping with the many complex makeup and wardrobe changes required, resulted in casting also being partially dependent on the logistics of moving a performer from one character to another.<ref name="telegraph_a" /><ref name="bfi5">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuxSzQDlaWQ |title=Horrible Histories Series Five BFI Q&A |medium=YouTube|publisher=British Film Institute|date=12 May 2013|accessdate=12 February 2014|author=Stephenson, David; Norris, Caroline; with the starring cast}}</ref> Recurring characters were if at all possible played by the actor who had originated the part, leading to the development of several signature roles, as for example Baynton's [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], [[Jim Howick]]'s Shouty Man, Rickard's Bob Hale, Willbond's [[Henry VIII]], [[Martha Howe-Douglas]]' [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Simon Farnaby]]'s [[Grim Reaper|Death]].<ref name="popm_a"/><ref name="bfi5"/>

Six performers (Baynton, Howick, Rickard, Willbond, Howe-Douglas and Farnaby) were credited as main or starring cast throughout the show's run; a seventh, [[Sarah Hadland]], left after the second series but returned with an "also starring" credit for the fourth and fifth. The initial sextet appeared from Series 2 onwards as the standard face of the show at premieres and other press opportunities, and performed together as such for such peripheral events as the show's BBC Prom concert.

===Historical accuracy===

Most criticism of the show revolves around the accuracy of its content. The TV series, like the books, has been used by educators as a classroom aid<ref name="tbivision_a" /> and was endorsed by UK Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] as useful for spotlighting "neglected periods of history."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10542727/Michael-Gove-criticises-disconnected-history-lessons.html | title=Michael Gove criticises 'disconnected' history lessons | work=The Telegraph| date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=3 January 2014|author=Paton, Graeme}}</ref> However, writing after the final episode, [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''The Spectator'' noted that "There has been some whipped-up controversy about ''Horrible Histories''", adding that "where the books make a rudimentary attempt to teach history as a series of interconnected events, the television show is basically gags, chiefly about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture. It's quite amusing, though whether it will pique an interest in the subject, or<U+2014>as some say<U+2014>merely encourage children to learn more about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture, we cannot know."<ref>{{cite web|author=Hoggart, Simon |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/6050573/shakespeare-in-school/ |title=Shakespeare in school|work=[[The Spectator]] |date=2 June 2010|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>

In a 20th-anniversary retrospective of the franchise in ''The Telegraph'', [[David Horspool]], the history editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', defended its overall viewpoint, saying, "There's no particular reason why grown-up historians shouldn't like ''Horrible Histories'' too&nbsp;... They simplify, and they have a definite point of view, but all historians are guilty of that to some degree." He further said that "Getting children interested in the past isn't necessarily easy, and ''Horrible Histories'' does it extremely effectively<U+2014>and those who come to history because it's fun seem far more likely to stay with it in the long run."<ref name="telegraph2_a" /> Writing for entertainment website DorkAdore, Anna Lowman added that "Terry Deary had the fine idea of getting kids into history by giving the facts a human face and a joke or two&nbsp;... The producers of the CBBC show have perfectly transferred Deary's ethos to television."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dorkadore.com/film-tv/horrible-histories-and-king-of-what-weve-been-watching/ | title=TV Reviews: Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry | work=Dork Adore | date=20 June 2011 | accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Lowman, Anna}}</ref>

The recut for BBC1 with Fry as host drew particular criticism as to whether its educational methods were suited to an adult demographic. ''[[History Today]]'' editor Paul Lay called the idea "frightening".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2011/06/horrible-histories-suitable-adults | title=Is 'Horrible Histories' suitable for adults? | work=[[History Today]]| date=20 June 2011 | accessdate=15 February 2014 | author=Lay, Paul}}</ref> Historian and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party MP]] [[Tristram Hunt]], while admitting that he had not yet actually seen the programme,<ref name="guardian_a" /> voiced his concerns that the show's content was not "challenging and stimulating" enough for the BBC, adding that "For children, ''Horrible Histories'' is an exciting aid to engage with the guts and gore of the past, but there are more sophisticated, populist ways of getting people involved in history than this. I'm in favour of populism, but there has to be a bit of depth to it."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000418/ | title=Horrible Histories to be remade for adult audience | work=British Comedy Guide | date=5 December 2011 | accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Wolf, Ian}}</ref>

Other critics have taken a more lenient view. Historian and television presenter Dan Snow described the show's ''modus operandi'' as "one step above ''Blackadder'', but that's fine&nbsp;... it plays to stereotypes, but it's fantastic as entry-level history."<ref name="guardian_a" /> Writing in ''The Independent'', [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] noted that "As a grown-up you might quibble with the fact that they don't always distinguish between things that genuinely are true and the things that people would like to be (sadly, there's no hard evidence that [[Aeschylus]] was brained by a tortoise dropped by an overflying eagle)", but added that "children and adults alike should enjoy the gleefully anachronistic way in which the information is presented."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-tv--coronation-street-itv1-the-5-oclock-show-with-peter-andre-channel-4-horrible-histories-cbbc-1988703.html|title=Last Night's TV|date=2 June 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 July 2010|author=Sutcliffe, Tom}}</ref> Dent in ''The Guardian'', while conceding what she called the show's  "frankly slapdash, dumbed-down approach to history", also argued that "in ''Horrible Histories'' there are always serious messages lurking amid the silliness."<ref name="guardian3_a" />

==Spin-offs==

In 2011, a spinoff game show, ''[[Horrible Histories: Gory Games]]'', was launched on CBBC. Likewise coproduced by Lion TV and Citrus, the show is co-hosted by [[Dave Lamb]] with puppet Rattus Rattus and includes cameos from many of the parent show's cast. As of 2013, the show had aired three full series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.radiotimes.com/programme/cpsr8/hh-gory-games/episodeguide | title=Episode Guide: HH Gory Games | work=[[Radio Times]]| accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref> For summer 2011, the show was repackaged for adult Sunday-night audiences as ''[[Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry]]'', a six-part "best of" compilation for main channel [[BBC One]]. The show featured a selection of sketches and songs from the first two series as chosen by the producers of the parent show, with Fry replacing the puppet rat as presenter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories_stephen_fry/ | title=Horrible Histories With Stephen Fry | work=British Comedy Guide| accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref>
