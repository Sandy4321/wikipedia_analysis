'''C<U+0103>ile Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne''' (''Romanian Railways'', abbreviated as '''CFR''') is the official designation of the [[state]] [[railway]] carrier of [[Romania]]. CFR manages the fourth-largest railway network in [[Europe]], in terms of volume of passengers and freight.<ref>{{cite web | title=RAD Equipment Connects Hundreds of Train Stations in Integrated Railway Information System (IRIS) | url=http://www.radfrisco.com/Article/0,6583,19847,00.html | accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> The network is significantly interconnected with other European railway networks, providing pan-European passenger and freight services. CFR as an entity has been operating since 1880, even though the first railway on current Romanian territory was opened in 1854.

Technically, CFR is divided into four autonomous companies: ''CFR C<U+0103>l<U+0103>tori'', which is responsible for passenger services; ''CFR Marf<U+0103>'', responsible for freight transport; ''CFR Infrastructur<U+0103>'', which manages the infrastructure on the Romanian railway network; and ''Societatea Feroviar<U+0103> de Turism'', or SFT, which manages scenic and tourist railways.

CFR is headquartered in [[Bucharest]] and has regional divisions in [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Craiova]], [[Ia<U+015F>i]], [[Gala<U+0163>i]] and [[Bra<U+015F>ov]]. Its [[International Union of Railways]] code is 53-CFR.<ref>{{cite web | title=The UIC numbering scheme | url=http://www.railfaneurope.net/misc/uicnum.html | accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

==History==

===Railways in the 19th century===
[[Image:Viaduct Oravita Anina.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A bridge on the Oravi<U+0163>a-Anina railway line, near Oravi<U+0163>a, in the Carpathian Mountains]]
[[Image:Oravita railway bridge.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A bridge across Oravi<U+0163>a Creek on the Oravi<U+0163>a-Bazia<U+015F> line, which continues to be in operation today, even though it stops at Iam instead of Bazia<U+015F>]]

The first railway line on Romania's present-day territory was opened on [[August 20]], [[1854]] and ran between [[Oravi<U+0163>a]] in [[Transylvania]] and [[Bazia<U+015F>]], a port on the [[Danube]]. The line, which had a length of 62.5 km, was used solely for the transportation of coal. From [[January 12]], [[1855]], the line was operated by Austrian Railways, Transylvania being at that time part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. After several improvements in the following months, the line was opened to passenger traffic from [[November 1]], [[1856]].

Between 1864 and 1880, several railways were constructed in what was then the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. On [[September 1]], [[1865]], the English company John Trevor-Barkley began construction on the [[Bucharest]]&ndash;[[Giurgiu]] line. The line was opened to traffic on [[August 26]], [[1869]]. The Bucharest-Giurgiu line was the first railway built on Romanian territory at that time, commissioned by the King of Romania (considering that the Oravi<U+0163>a-Bazia<U+015F> line was part of Austria-Hungary, even though it presently lies on Romanian territory).

In September 1866, the Romanian Parliament voted for the construction of a 915-km railway, from [[V<U+00E2>rciorova]] in the south to [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] in the north, via [[Pite<U+015F>ti]], [[Bucharest]], [[Buz<U+0103>u]], [[Br<U+0103>ila]], [[Gala<U+0163>i]] and [[Tecuci]], all important population centres. The price for the construction was at that time 270,000 golden francs per kilometre and was contracted to the German Strousberg consortium. The line was opened in various stages, the first stage ([[Pite<U+015F>ti]]-[[Bucharest]]-[[Gala<U+0163>i]]-[[Roman, Romania|Roman]]) being opened to traffic on [[September 13]] [[1872]], while the [[V<U+00E2>rciorova]]-[[Pite<U+015F>ti]] segment was opened some time later, on [[May 9]], [[1878]]. The V<U+00E2>rciorova-Roman line was an important part of Romania's rail infrastructure because it spanned the entire Kingdom and provided an important connection for passengers and freight between several significant [[Wallachia|Wallachian]] and [[Moldavia|Moldavian]] cities.

On [[September 10]], [[1868]], Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]] (North Station) was finalised. On January 1880, the Romanian Parliament voted to transfer the ownership of the V<U+00E2>rciorova-Roman line from the private administration of the Strousberg consortium to state ownership, under the administration of CFR. 1880 therefore marks the start of the C<U+0103>ile Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne institution which survives to this date. The first administration of CFR was made up of Lords Kalinderu, St<U+0103>tescu and Falcoianu.

On May 1868, the Romanian state concluded an agreement with another German consortium, known as the "Offenheim Consortium", for the construction of several shorter railways in the region of [[Moldavia]]. The lines, which had a total length of 224 km, would run from [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] to [[I<U+0163>cani]],  from [[Pa<U+015F>cani]] to [[Ia<U+015F>i]] and from [[Vere<U+015F>ti]] to [[Boto<U+015F>ani]]. The lines were progressively opened from December 1869 to November 1871. Due to the poor management of the lines by the Offenheim Consortium, they were placed under the manangement of CFR in January 1889.

Meanwhile, during the [[Romanian War of Independence]] in 1877, Romania annexed the region of [[Dobrogea]], which had previously belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Romanian state placed under the management of CFR the [[Constan<U+0163>a]]-[[Cernavod<U+0103>]] line, which had been opened during the Ottoman times in 1860. The Bucharest-Giurgiu line, the first line constructed in the Kingdom of Romania, was also placed under the administration of CFR during this time.

Hence, by 1889, the Romanian state became the owner of all of the lines in the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the railway system having a total length of 1377 km.

===Railways in the early 20th century===

[[Image:Gara de nord foto veche.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]] in the 1930s]]

In 1918, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] annexed the regions of [[Transylvania]], [[Besserabia]] and [[Bukovina]] to form [[Greater Romania]]. As a result, all railway lines in these regions, previously under the ownership of [[Austria-Hungary]] or the [[Russian Empire]], were placed under the administration of CFR. This event was significant for Romanian railways because it meant that the large [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] rolling stock and steel factory, previously located on Austro-Hungarian territory, was now part of Romania, and was consequently used to produce a wide range of rolling stock and locomotives for CFR.

During this time, various railways were "doubled" &mdash; that is, double tracks were introduced on routes to permit a greater flow of traffic. The first line to be doubled was the [[Bucharest]]-[[Ploie<U+015F>ti]]-[[C<U+00E2>mpina]] line, where doubling was completed in 1912. In the period between the wars, various other lines were doubled, including:

*[[Constan<U+0163>a]]&ndash;[[Cernavod<U+0103>]] (1931)
*[[Adjud]]&ndash;[[Tecuci]] (1933)
*[[Teiu<U+015F>]]&ndash;[[Apahida]] (1940)
*[[C<U+00E2>mpina]]&ndash;[[Bra<U+015F>ov]] (1941)
*[[Buz<U+0103>u]]&ndash;[[M<U+0103>r<U+0103><U+015F>e<U+015F>ti]] (1942)

During the 1920s and 1930s CFR also bought several new locomotives and cars, embarking on a plan of widespread modernisation. Diesel traction was introduced, and the Malaxa high-speed [[Diesel multiple unit|DMUs]] (a modernised version of which are still in use as commuter trains in [[Banat]]) were built.

A significant event in the history of the railways was the [[Grivi<U+0163>a Strike of 1933]], which occurred during the [[Great Depression]] and resulted in violent clashes between railway workers and police.

===Railways in Communist Romania===

[[Image:CFR class 43 locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Class 43 electric locomotive built during the Communist times in [[Zagreb]], [[former Yugoslavia]] (now [[Croatia]]) and used by CFR]]

After Romania became a [[Communist Romania|Communist]] republic in 1949, there was quite a significant amount of investment in railway infrastructure, often to the detriment of other forms of infrastructure, especially roads. During this period, railways were seen as the symbol of Romania's rapid industrialisation under Communist leaders [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] and, later, dictator [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]]. Aside from an increase in train traffic and the construction of various new lines, especially in rural areas, the bulk of electrification and line doubling occurred during the Communist period.

The first line to be electrified on the Romanian railway network was the [[Bucharest]]-[[Bra<U+015F>ov]] line, which was used by a significant amount of passenger and freight traffic. Works on electrification started in 1959, and the first electrified segment, from [[Bra<U+015F>ov]] to [[Predeal]], opened on [[December 9]], [[1965]]. By [[April 20]], [[1966]], a further segment was electrified, from Predeal to [[C<U+00E2>mpina]]. The entire line was electrified by [[February 16]], [[1969]], at a frequency of 50 Hz and voltage of 25 kV.

Various lines were also supplemented with double tracks to permit a wider flow of traffic, including:

*[[F<U+0103>urei]]-[[Gala<U+0163>i]] (1971)
*[[Pantelimon]]-[[Cernavod<U+0103>]] (1971)
*[[Bucharest]]-[[Ro<U+015F>iori]]-[[Craiova]] (1972)
*[[Chitila]]-[[Gole<U+015F>ti]] (1972)
*[[Bra<U+015F>ov]]-[[C<U+00E2>mpul Libert<U+0103><U+0163>ii]] (1974)
*[[Adjud]]-[[Suceava]] (1975)

By the mid-1970s, steam traction disappeared completely out of mainstream use, being replaced by standardised diesel and electric locomotives and cars, most of which were built in Romania, at the Astra factory in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].

===CFR after 1989===

[[Image:Bucharest Gara de Nord tracks.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of tracks entering Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]], 2002]]

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], which resulted in the fall of Communism, Romania was left with one of the largest, most dense and most frequently-used railway networks in Europe, but at the same time relatively outdated infrastructure. This, combined with the economic decline that Romania faced in the 1990s due to <!-- please stop putting in "mismanagement". That is a Point Of View. POV is prohibited in Wiki --> its transition to a market economy, resulted in CFR entering a period of relative decline. Several little-used routes, especially in rural areas, were cut back, and rolling stock, most of which was acquired in the 1970s, entered a period of disrepair. CFR's image, both domestically and abroad, suffered greatly, due to reports of dilapidated trains, poor service and general disarray of management.

This situation continued until the year 1998, when ''Societatea Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103> a C<U+0103>ilor Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne'' (The National Society of Romanian Railways) was reorganised into four independently-administered divisions, in order to improve its efficiency, and the company was renamed ''Compania Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103> de C<U+0103>i Ferate "CFR" SA'' (National Railway Company "CFR"). After this, the situation of Romanian railways improved significantly, mainly spurred on by Romania's economic boom after the year 2000, which permitted a considerable amount of government investment in railways and has led CFR to once again become one of the most successful railway operators in the region. 

Since 1989, a number of small branch lines have been closed &mdash; especially those designated for industrial purposes or having a [[narrow gauge]]. This has been generally done due to greater competition from private bus services as well as generally low passenger numbers on those lines. Some other line closures are to occur in the future, especially on the branch lines in [[Timi<U+015F> County|Timi<U+015F>]] county, which are generally very old, little-used and heavily damaged by the 2005 floods in that area. All in all, another 75 km of railways are to close until 2007 (around 1000-1500 km of rail have closed since 1990, all of which were in rural areas). Some narrow-gauge tracks have recently been reopened by SFT (CFR's Railway Tourism Society) for [[tourism]], but are only run occasionally, about twice a month (lines include Abrud-C<U+00E2>mpeni, [[T<U+00E2>rgu Mure<U+015F>]]-Band or Moldovi<U+0163>a-Canton). All forestry railroads (''c<U+0103>i ferate forestiere'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) still in operation after 1989 have been privatised and sold to the forestry companies. Some, such as the [[Vasser Valley Scenic Railroad]], have since become significant tourist attractions.

===Modernisation===

[[Image:Sageata albastra in pitesti station.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Siemens [[Desiro]], or ''Sageata Albastr<U+0103>'' (Blue Arrow), the icon of the CFR's comprehensive post-2000 modernisation plan]]

In the early 2000s, CFR embarked on a comprehensive modernisation programme in order to improve its image, which was, both internationally and domestically, plagued by reports of poor service and outdated rolling stock. The first phases of the modernisation included a refurbishment of a large number of Rapid and InterCity rolling stock, as well as a general expansion of IC services to form a Romania-wide express network.

To strengthen the growth of the Romanian InterCity network, CFR acquired in early 2003 several new [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] [[Desiro]] trainsets, some of which were assembled in [[Arad, Romania]].<ref>{{ro icon}} {{cite web | title=S<U+0103>geata Albastr<U+0103> revine pe "drumul de fier"| url=http://www.cfr.ro/jf/romana/0301/debut.htm#b | accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> Nicknamed "Sageata Albastr<U+0103>" (''Blue Arrow''), they are used on Accelerat, Rapid and InterCity services for short and medium distances. The Desiro trainsets were used as the icons of CFR's modernisation, despite criticism that CFR shouldn't have used the Desiro trainsets, which are [[diesel multiple units]], on mainline express services, as they are designed mainly for short-distance commuter rail, as seen by their fairly hard seating, low speed, and poor noise insulation. CFR responded to this by introducing, in late 2004, a number of new Desiro trainsets that had better sound insulation and 70 seats, instead of 110 seats, thereby increasing the width and pitch of the seats.<ref>{{ro icon}} {{cite web | title=Noua S<U+0103>geat<U+0103> Albastr<U+0103> - De la 10 noiembrie <U+015F>i pe ruta Timi<U+015F>oara-Re<U+015F>i<U+0163>a <U+015F>i retur!| url=http://stiri.acasa.ro/10253.html| accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> To this date, CFR continues to use Desiro trains on medium-distance routes, even though it has replaced them on several long-distance routes by other refurbished rolling stock.

Aside from the Desiro, CFR has also bought in the past few years 80 new [[sleeper car]]s (WLABmee type), couchettes, InterCity cars, as well as double-decker cars to use on Accelerat and Rapid trains of a high volume of passengers. The new CFR sleepers are currently some of the most modern in Europe, having air-conditioning, LCD screens and modern showers in each compartment.<ref>{{ro icon}}  {{cite web | title=De la 1 mai, biletele de tren se scumpesc cu 5,6%| url=http://www.wall-street.ro/articol/Turism-Real-Estate/1891/De-la-1-mai-biletele-de-tren-se-scumpesc-cu-56| accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

Apart from improvements in rolling stock, CFR has also bought or modernised several locomotive classes, including the widespread Class 40 and Class 41 electric locomotives. 

[[Image:CFR agentia de voiaj.jpg|thumb|left|250px|CFR's main ticket office in Bucharest, near [[Gara de Nord]], which is the first to issue electronic tickets as part of the XSELL program]]

Part of the CFR modernisation programme is the XSELL programme, which seeks to establish a Romania-wide electronic ticketing system. It is to be noted that while Romanian railway services have improved significantly in the past decade and now comply to European standards, the ticketing system remains very antiquated, still using cardboard tokens instead of electronic tickets. The XSELL programme was launched at [[Gara de Nord|Bucharest North station]] in November 2004,<ref>{{ro icon}} {{cite web | title=Deschiderea Agen<U+0163>iei de Voiaj Nr. 1| url=http://www.infofer.ro/evenimente.htm| accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> and is now in use in almost all major railway stations in Romania.

In 2003, Romanian mobile phone operator [[Connex GSM Romania]], now Vodafone, struck a deal with CFR to provide quick mobile services to the CFR timetable and booking system. Currently, a 24-hour hotline operates where customers of Connex can call a certain three-digit number (652) and get real-time information on train routes, timetables, station platform departures, delays, prices and ticketing information and booking of trains from Bucharest North station. [[Orange Romania]] has signed a similar agreement in early 2004.

CFR services continue to improve, with the company currently reaching a turning point in its business strategy and services being some of the best in the region. However, some people have raised concerns that CFR, which has not reached profitability yet, does not have the means to finance ongoing infrastructural modernisation, especially in the context of a government that is, at present, keener to develop road infrastructure at the expense of railways.

===Partial privatisation===

Although passenger railway services are not a state monopoly in Romania, CFR remains the only passenger carrier operating at a national level. However, after the reorganisation of CFR in 1998, around 10% of Romanian railway tracks have been leased to private companies. Known as non-interoperable tracks (''linii neinteroperabile'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), these include the [[Z<U+0103>rne<U+015F>ti]]-[[Bra<U+015F>ov]] and [[Ploie<U+015F>ti]]-[[Maneciu]] lines. On these lines, CFR is not allowed to operate its trains &mdash; companies which have leased the tracks have a virtual monopoly on their usage. Aside from CFR C<U+0103>l<U+0103>tori, 12 other companies provide local passenger services, on non-interoperable tracks, even though none of these services exceed 40 km in line length. 28 private companies, including Petromidia and Servtrans, operate freight transport services on main lines with their own rolling stock, leasing usage rights from CFR. [[As of 2005]], some of the leases have been breached and the tracks have therefore fallen back under the operation of CFR. In August 2005, CFR announced that it intended to privatise CFR Marf<U+0103>, its freight division.

==Passenger services==

[[Image:Gara de Nord train board.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Departures board in Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]] showing the different types of trains]]

CFR C<U+0103>l<U+0103>tori, the passenger service division of CFR, operates seven ''types'' of [[passenger train]], both on Romania's territory, with rolling stock and [[locomotive]]s, or internationally, with rolling stock. Also, CFR operates international trains on Romanian territory with its own locomotives. The train types vary in terms of speed and type of rolling stock.

CFR train types are:

*'''Personal''' (P) - the trains have assigned numbers from 2000 to 9999
*'''Accelerat''' (A) - the trains have assigned numbers from 1000 to 1999
*'''Rapid''' (R) - numbered from 200 to 499, from 600 to 999 and from 10000 to 14999 
*'''InterCity''' (IC) - numbered from 500 to 599   
*'''EuroCity''' (EC) - numbered as IC trains from 500 to 599
*'''EuroNight''' (EN) - numbered as IC trains from 500 to 599
*'''Special''' (S) - tourist trains operated on scenic routes with vintage rolling stock, numbered from S1 to S9

Aside from the seven main train types, CFR also operates night trains, which can be of any status (usually Rapid, InterCity or EuroNight). Freight trains, operated by CFR Marf<U+0103>, have a different numbering system.

===Personal===
[[Image:CFR old doubledecker car.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Older Personal double-decker rolling stock at [[Timi<U+015F>oara]] Nord station]]
'''Personal trains''', sometimes known as [[commuter train]]s, are the most abundant type of train on the CFR passenger network. They are used for two main purposes, as shuttle, or commuter, trains, linking towns with neighbouring villages, and linking neighbouring cities with each other.

Personal trains have the lowest average speed (34.3 km/h in 2004) and the least-comfortable (usually oldest) rolling stock, and have a reputation for being very slow, crowded and generally unkempt. Personal trains operate mostly on local routes and stop at every station. Train fares for this type are the cheapest, since no supplement is paid, only the base fee, based on distance. Seats are usually not reservable.

The rolling stock on Personal trains differs widely. On routes that link neighbouring cities with each other (such as [[Bucharest]] and [[Pite<U+015F>ti]]), the quality of the rolling stock is much better than those services which provide a shuttle link between cities and rural areas (such as the [[Timi<U+015F>oara]]-Berzovia line).

Most Personal rolling stock consist of uncompartmented single and double-deckered cars. Some train services of this type, especially on rural routes, only have 2nd class rolling stock (i.e. there are no 1st class carriages). The livery of most Personal cars is painted in blue, with the rolling stock built in the 1970s and 1980s. Some very short rural routes in Romania's [[Bukovina]] region use rolling stock from the 1940s and 1950s, refitted with bus seats  and operating like [[railbus|railbuses]]. CFR is currently refurbishing a range of double-decker Personal cars, that will be used on Personal and Accelerat trains. The refurbished cars, painted in the exact same livery as the old ones, have been introduced since 2003, and are cleaner, although they still use most of the old fittings.

===Accelerat===
[[Image:CFR accelerat train.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Accelerat train leaving [[Cluj-Napoca]] for [[Ia<U+015F>i]] in 2002]]
'''Accelerat trains''' (''accelerated trains'') are used for medium- and long-distance services that stop only in towns or cities. Accelerat trains use better rolling stock than Personal trains, and have higher speeds. They are also more expensive, requiring the payment of a supplement alongside the base fee. Some services of the Accelerat type require a reservation. Accelerat trains are also used for cross-regional long-distance routes (for example, [[Oradea]] to [[Gala<U+0163>i]], a distance of more than 830 km). Despite the long distances, Accelerat trains tend to stop in every town (even though they bypass villages) and hence are very popular, though they are seldom used for express travel between two large cities.

[[Image:CFR new doubledecker car.jpg|thumb|left|200px|New Accelerat-type double-decker train car in [[Cluj-Napoca]] station]]

The Accelerat rolling stock is formed mostly of single-deckered cars, of the old Y type, painted in blue, either plain or with a white horizontal stripe. All cars are compartmented, with 8 seats per compartment in second class and 6 in first class. Rolling stock is of considerably poorer quality than Rapid and InterCity trains, as almost no Accelerat cars have been refurbished yet (except for the trains which link the capital city [[Bucharest]] with [[Constan<U+0163>a]]). Accelerat trains also have a reputation for being overcrowded and dirty due to the long distances which they travel and the relatively frequent stops they make.

CFR has, however, begun a modernisation process for Accelerat services. In early 2005, it introduced a new double-decker car for medium-distance, highly-used Accelerat routes such as [[Bucharest]]&ndash;[[Predeal]]. [[Desiro]] trainsets have also been introduced on medium-distance Accelerat routes in [[Transylvania]] and [[Moldova]] ([[Ia<U+015F>i]] - [[Piatra Neam<U+0163>]]). Longer-distance Accelerat trains often have couchettes, though they rarely have sleepers. Dining cars are never used on these trains.

Two international trains ([[Bucharest]]-[[Venice]] and [[Bucharest]]-[[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]]) are run as Accelerat-type on Romanian territory, in order to keep ticket prices cheaper and therefore make the services more competitive with competing road and air transport. However, the rolling stock used on such trains is identical to InterCity rolling stock and is thus of a high quality.

===Rapid===
[[Image:CFR Rapid train.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Typical CFR 1st-class Rapid train car]]
'''Rapid trains''' are significantly faster and more comfortable than Accelerat and Personal trains, and are the ones most commonly used for long-distance express travel between major Romanian cities. Rapid trains operate only on main lines between key population centres, making stops only in major towns and cities. Unlike Accelerat trains, they don't provide cross-regional long distance services, instead focussing on highly-travelled routes and making few stops.

[[Image:CFR refurbished salon coach.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of refurbished Rapid train car]]

Rolling stock on Rapid trains has recently been the object of CFR's modernisation plan. Various classes of cars have been refurbished, and fitted with air-conditioning, ecological toilets, etc. However, a small and rapidly-declining number of Rapid rolling stock, mainly on lesser-used routes, remains fairly aged and outdated. As of 2004, [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] [[Desiro]] DMUs have been introduced on medium-distance Rapid routes. Most Rapid rolling stock is painted in red, usually with a white horizontal stripe. All cars are compartmented and first class is usually air-conditioned, with 6 seats per compartment both in second class and first class. Sleepers, couchettes and dining-cars are available on most long routes.

===InterCity===
[[Image:Romanian InterCity train 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A refurbished InterCity train in the grey and red livery at [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] station in May 2003]]
'''[[InterCity]]''' (IC) is CFR's premier train type and is used for express services between major cities, as well as shuttle services between Bucharest and the [[Black Sea]] coast and the Carpathian mountain resorts of [[Sinaia]] and [[Predeal]]. InterCity trains typically only stop in large cities (generally of over 100,000 inhabitants). InterCity trains are the fastest out of all the train types, having an average speed of 87 km/h in 2004, and also use the most modern and comfortable rolling stock, rivalling the premier services of other European carriers. Due to this, InterCity prices include a significant supplement alongside the base fee. However, due to the fact that IC services are only slightly more expensive than Rapid services, InterCity trains have become very popular for both travellers and businesspeople.

[[Image:CFR InterCity 2nd-class salon 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of 2nd-class refurbished InterCity car]]

There are two main types of InterCity rolling stock: standard (or "classic") and Desiro. The standard InterCity rolling stock is either new or refurbished (all IC rolling stock was built after 1995), with air-conditioning and plush bucket armchairs, as well as complementary newspapers, free meals and airplane-like service in first class. These trains generally have a reputation for their high levels of comfort, cleanliness and service. The InterCity standard livery is usually grey and red, especially in the case of the C160-class rolling stock, which is the newest type. Most InterCity rolling stock is compartmented, even though recently there has been a trend to abolish compartments in the process of refurbishing cars.

[[Image:CFR desiro3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|InterCity service IC564 from [[Ia<U+015F>i]] to [[Bucharest]] using Desiro rolling stock]]

High-passenger and international IC services, such as the Bucharest-[[Constan<U+0163>a]] route, use the Romanian-built Astra AVA-200 cars, which have a maximum speed of 200 km/h and are the most comfortable rolling stock in the CFR fleet. In fact, according to Friends of CFR, a Romanian railway journal, there was a considerable downgrading in quality when the [[Bucharest]]-[[Vienna]] IC service switched from being operated by CFR to being run by Austrian Railways ([[<U+00D6>BB]]) in 2003, leading to numerous complaints that the route should revert back to CFR cars instead of Austrian <U+00D6>BB cars.

The [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] [[Desiro]] rolling stock, coloured in blue and white, which uses [[diesel multiple unit|DMUs]], is used for shorter-distance IC services, usually with only one or two intermiary stops (for example, the [[Sibiu]]-[[Bra<U+015F>ov]] route). They are also used on non-electrified routes. [[As of 2005]], InterCity trains operate on the following routes:

Some IC services run at night and therefore contain sleepers. Older sleeper rolling stock uses the red livery, while the new sleepers are painted in the blue-yellow-white "night" livery.

Before early 2003, there was also a train type known as InterCityExpress (ICE), which ran from Bucharest to Constan<U+0163>a, but these have been discontinued and transformed into IC, while maintaining the same rolling stock.

===EuroCity and EuroNight===
[[Image:CFR new sleeper.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A new CFR [[sleeping car]] in the EuroNight 371 train from Budapest to Bucharest]]

'''[[EuroCity]]''' (EC) and '''[[EuroNight]]''' (EN) are international trains which are usually run by CFR in partnership with another national carrier, depending on the origin and destination of the route. There trains are part of the pan-European express railway network. Not all international trains that come to or via Romania are of EC or EN type &mdash; most are usually run as Rapid trains on the territory of Romania. However, the night train from [[Belgrade]] to [[Bucharest]] is run as a EuroNight train, and there is both a EuroCity and a EuroNight train from [[Budapest]] to [[Bucharest]] via [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. EuroCity trains are almost always comfortable and modern, even though not perhaps as comfortable as InterCity, since they generally use the same rolling stock as Rapid trains. EuroNight trains use modern sleepers and have a generally good safety record.

The CFR operates several different types of [[sleeping car]]s in EuroNight and other night trains. In international trains, the sleeping cars built by [[Deutsche Waggonbau AG]] around 1990 are preferred as these have a good level of comfort and showers. They are currently undergoing serious refurbishment to comply with international standards. In addition, several older types of sleeping cars (WLAB33, T2S) were recently bought second hand from [[Germany]]; these are being modernized and mostly used inside Romania and to the neighbour countries (as shown in the picture). They have replaced the archaic [[OSShD]]-B/Y sleeping cars previously used in these services.

===Speeds===

The speed limit for all trains in Romania is 160 km/h, although the only sectors trains run at that speeds are [[Bucharest]]-[[C<U+00E2>mpina]] and [[Bucharest]]-[[Constan<U+0163>a]], which is now undergoing heavy modernisation works, which will allow trains to go as fast as 200km/h, and the only trains allowed to go that fast are those of InterCity and Rapid type. All other trains have a general speed limit of 120 km/h. Average operating speeds (including all stops in stations) according to CFR, were in 2004: 

*34.3 km/h for Personal trains
*67 km/h for Accelerat trains
*85 km/h for Rapid trains
*87 km/h for InterCity trains

The longest train route, as of 2005, is the one between [[Suceava]], in the north-east, and [[Timi<U+015F>oara]], in the south-west, takes 15 hours with an Accelerat-type train. The longest route for an InterCity train ([[Oradea]] &ndash; [[Constan<U+0163>a]]) takes 12 hours to complete.

==Freight services==

Freight services in Romania are operated mostly by CFR Marf<U+0103>, the freight division of CFR, as well as by 28 other private companies who operate on lines leased from CFR Infrastructur<U+0103>. The CFR Marf<U+0103> fleet is made up of 987 locomotives,<ref>{{ro icon}} {{cite web | title=Parcul de locomotive CFR Marf<U+0103>| url=http://www.cfrmarfa.cfr.ro/dreapta31.html| accessdate=October 30 | accessyear=2005 }}
</ref> most of which were built in [[Romania]] or the [[former Yugoslavia]]. The fact that rail freight remains maintains a strong market share in Romania, as well as a number of efficiency reforms, has led CFR Marf<U+0103> to perform quite well financially in recent years, even though it remains loss-making. In 2003, the CFR Marf<U+0103>'s net loss was 8.8 million [[Romanian leu|new lei]] (approximately US$3 million), reduced from 141.5 million new lei in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | title=The National Freight Railway Transport Company - CFR Marf<U+0103> SA - Consolidated financial statements (2003)| url=http://www.cfrmarfa.cfr.ro/images/bilant%20eng.htm| accessdate=July 10 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

Freight trains follow the same speed limits to those issued for passenger trains, although hazardous materials, explosive, nuclear, flammable, chemical or otherwise dangerous trains have a special regime. Most locomotives have a physical speed limit of 200 km/h, but freight trains are not usually run at speeds exceeding 100 km/h.

==Locomotives and stock==

CFR C<U+0103>l<U+0103>tori (passenger services) and CFR Marf<U+0103> (freight services) use a range of electric (known as LE), diesel electric (LDE), diesel hydraulic (LDH) and diesel mechanical (LDM/LDMM) locomotives. SFT (tourist railways division) uses steam locomotives (both narrow gauge and standard gauge) and diesel mechanical locomotives.

Each of the four CFR divisions have their own locomotives, and these are generally not interchanged. For example, a CFR Marf<U+01CE> locomotive should not be used to pull a CFR C<U+01CE>l<U+01CE>tori train. In practice however, this rule does not hold, and frequently the companies use other rolling stock through informal lease agreements. Moreover, private companies' rolling stock is used at times, usually because of emergencies (such as a locomotive breaking down and requiring a replacement to keep the line open, and an unused private locomotive being closer).

===Electric locomotives===

Most of the electric locomotives employed by CFR were built by [[Electroputere]] [[Craiova]] (known as EA-type) and [[Kon<U+010D>ar]] [[Zagreb]] (known as EC-type). All are built for standard gauge (1435 mm) and run using a catenary wire at 50 Hz 25 kV [[Alternating current|AC]]. All trains have electric heating. CFR currently owns 1,066 electric locomotives, 933 of which were built by Electroputere and 133 built by Kon<U+010D>ar. Older electric locomotives are painted in grey livery, while modernised (post-1999) rolling stock use red livery.

===Diesel locomotives===

CFR's diesel locomotives have been built by [[Electroputere]] [[Craiova]] (classes 60 to 68) and [[Faur]] [[Bucharest]] (classes 69 to 95). A number of new [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] ER20 Hercules locomotives have been ordered and CFR awaits delivery, with their delivery scheduled for November 2005. These will be used by CFR Marf<U+0103> for freight services. New diesel locomotives are painted in blue livery, while older ones have grey livery. The following classes are currently in service:

===Diesel multiple units===

CFR C<U+0103>l<U+0103>tori uses [[diesel multiple units]] (DMUs) mainly for passenger services on shorter and little-used lines, even though recently, with the introduction of the Siemens Desiro DMU, they have been used for InterCity services on longer distances.

===Electric multiple units===

[[Image:Szatmarnemeti.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Bilingual (Romanian and Hungarian) CFR railway station sign in the city of [[Satu Mare]]]]

No [[electric multiple units]] (EMUs) are currently in service. However, 30 Siemens [[Desiro]] electric trainsets have been bought and await delivery (these are nearly identical to class 96 Desiro units except for the fact that they use electrical power instead of diesel). There are some rumours that some  EMUs will also be bought (possibly of [[Pendolino]] type) for InterCity service, on the [[Bucharest]]-Bra<U+015F>ov and [[Bucharest]]-Constan<U+0163>a line, with a top speed of 220 km/h. A 6-car regional EMU built by [[Electroputere]] has been in prototype stage since 1990 after it experienced brake and engine problems during initial testing. CFR has recently bought some second-hand Z-6100 EMU from [[SNCF]], and their [[Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois|CFL]] version 250 with 2 cars and 260 with 3 cars, which are curently being modernised by Remarul 16 Februarie in [[Cluj]] and will be used for commuter trains. The first one is already in service, as class 58.
