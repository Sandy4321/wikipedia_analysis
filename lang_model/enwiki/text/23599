The history of [[law enforcement in the United States]] includes many efforts at police reform.

In the 1960s, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] created the [[President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice]]. The Commission's final report was issued in 1967<ref name="McGarrell1988">{{cite book|author=Edmund F.

In the 2010s, a series of shootings of unarmed individuals by police officers correlated with calls for police and law enforcement reform, especially regarding the diversity of police officers and the treatment of minorities by the criminal justice system. President [[Barack Obama]] created a commission on police reform. The commission issued a report on March 2, 2015, that made numerous recommendations. It did not call for all officers to wear [[body cameras]], but did call "for independent prosecutors to investigate whenever an officer kills a civilian while on duty." A spokesperson for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] said that the ideas in the report "will significantly improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve" and that "For us to see meaningful change, local authorities must first implement data collection systems to improve transparency, use of force policies that emphasize de-escalation, eradicate all forms of biased policing, and improve community engagement and oversight to provide accountability."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bacon|first1=Perry, Jr.|title=Obama Police Commission Sidesteps Most Controversial Reforms|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/obama-police-commission-sidesteps-most-controversial-reforms-n315801|website=nbcnews.com|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> 

In the specific case of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson in August 2014, an investigation by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] [[Civil Rights Division]] concluded that, while there were not grounds to charge the police officer who shot Brown with a criminal offense, the Ferguson Police Department as a whole "was routinely violating the constitutional rights of its black residents."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Apuzzo|first1=Matt|title=Ferguson Police Routinely Violate Rights of Blacks, Justice Dept.

A number of law enforcement agencies in the United States in the early 2000s and 2010s began to emphasize [[de-escalation]] as a method of [[conflict resolution]] and obtaining voluntary compliance. There are also emphases [[community policing]] to build relationships and community trust in law enforcement, the [[evidence-based policing]] approach of using of data to assist with decision-making, and the importance of civilian oversight of police work.{{cn}}
