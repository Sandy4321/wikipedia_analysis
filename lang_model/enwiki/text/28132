'''D-loop replication''' is a process by which [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]] replicate their genetic material.  An important component of understanding [[D-loop]] replication is that [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]] have a single circular [[chromosome]] like [[bacterium|bacteria]] instead of the linear [[chromosome]]s found in [[eukaryote]]s.

In many organisms, one strand of [[DNA]] in the [[plastid]] comprises heavier [[nucleotide]]s (relatively more [[purine]]s: [[adenine]] and [[guanine]]).  This strand is called the H (heavy) strand.  The L (light) strand comprises lighter nucleotides ([[pyrimidine]]s: [[thymine]] and [[cytosine]]).  Replication begins with replication of the heavy strand starting at the [[D-loop]] (also known as the control region).  An origin of replication opens, and the heavy strand is replicated in one direction. After heavy strand replication has continued for some time, a new light strand is also synthesized, through the opening of another origin of replication.  When diagramed, the resulting structure looks like the letter D.

The D-loop region is important for [[phylogeography|phylogeographic]] studies.  Because the region does not code for any genes, it is free to vary with only a few [[natural selection|selective]] limitations on size and heavy/light strand factors.  The [[mutation rate]] is among the fastest of anywhere in either the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes in animals.  [[Mutation]]s in the D-loop can effectively track recent and rapid [[evolution]]ary changes such as within [[species]] and among very closely related species.
