'''<U+0130>smail Enver''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: <U+0627><U+0633><U+0645><U+0627><U+0639><U+064A><U+0644> <U+0627><U+0646><U+0648><U+0631>) <span dir="ltr">([[November 22]], [[1881]] in [[Istanbul]] - [[August 4]], [[1922]])</span>, known to Europeans during his political career as '''Enver [[Pasha]]''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''Enver Pa<U+015F>a''') or '''Enver [[Bey]]''' was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] military officer and a leader of the [[Young Turk]] revolution. He was the main leader of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in both [[Balkan War]]s and [[World War I]].

== Early life and career ==
Enver Bey was born to a wealthy family in [[Istanbul]].  He studied in different degrees of military schools in the empire and finally he graduated from the ''Harp Akademisi'' in 1903.  He became a Major in 1906.  He was sent to the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] which was stationed in [[Salonica]].  During his service in the city, he became a member of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]].

== Rise to power==
{{Seealso|Young Turk Revolution|Italo-Turkish War|Balkan Wars}}
In 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] broke out in Salonica, and the young Enver quickly became one of its military leaders.  The successful revolt brought the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] to power, ushering the so-called "[[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]]" of the Ottoman Empire.  During the course of the next year, a reactionary conspiracy to organize a [[Countercoup (1909)|countercoup]] culminated in the "[[31 March Incident]]", which was put down.  Enver Bey took an active role in the suppression of the uprising.  Afterwards, he was sent to [[Berlin]] as a military attach<U+00E9>, where he grew to admire the German military culture, and strengthened the military ties between Germany and the Ottoman Empire, inviting German officers to reform the Ottoman Army.

In 1911, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] launched an invasion of the Ottoman province of ''Trablusgarp'' (modern [[Libya]], starting the [[Italo-Turkish War]]. Enver decided to join the defense of the province and left Berlin for Libya.  There he assumed the overall command, but in the end Italy took control of Libya and Enver Bey had to return to Istanbul.  In 1912, thanks to his active role in the war, he was made Lieutenant Colonel in 1912.  However, the defeat cost the CUP in popularity, and it fell from government, to be replaced by the [[Liberal Union (Ottoman Empire)|Liberal Union]].  In October 1912, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out, where the Ottoman armies suffered severe defeats at the hands of the [[Balkan League]].  These military reversals weakened the government, and gave Enver his chance to grab for power.  In a [[Coup of 1913|coup]] in January 1913, the Young Turks took power, with Enver as War Minister, and left the [[London Conference of 1913|peace negotiations]] then under way in London.  The renewed hostilities only worsened the Empire's situation, however, as the two major remaining strongholds of [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]] (Edirne) and [[Battle of Bizani|Yannina]] fell to the Bulgarians and the Greeks, respectively, forcing the Ottomans to concede defeat at the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]].

In June 1913 however, the [[Second Balkan War]] broke out between the Balkan Allies. Enver Bey took advantage of the situation and led an army into [[Eastern Thrace]], recovering Adrianople from the Bulgarians, who had concentrated their forces against the Serbs and Greeks. After this success, Enver Bey became a Pasha.

After these political and military achievements, he introduced a military dictatorship that came to be called the [[Three Pashas]] (Enver Pasha, [[Mehmed Talat Pasha|Talat Pasha]], and [[Ahmed Djemal|Djemal Pasha]]).  In 1914, he was again Minister of War in the cabinet of Sait Halim Pasha, and married the daughter of Prince S<U+00FC>leyman, thus entering the royal family. His power grew steadily while Europe marched towards total war.

== World War One ==

{{Further|[[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]]}}
Enver Pa<U+015F>a was an architect of the [[Ottoman-German Alliance]], and expected a quick victory in the war that would benefit the Ottoman Empire.  Without informing the other members of the Cabinet, he allowed the two German warships [[SMS Goeben]] and [[SMS Breslau]] to enter the Dardanelles, thus enabling them to escape British [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit]]; the subsequent "donation" of the ships to the neutral Ottomans worked powerfully in Germany's favor, despite French and Russian [[diplomacy]] to keep Ottoman Empire out of the war.  Finally on [[29 October]], the point of no return was reached when Admiral Souchon took ''Goeben'', ''Breslau'' and a squadron of Ottoman warships into the Black Sea and raided the Russian ports of [[Odessa]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Theodosia]].  Russia declared war on Ottoman Empire on [[2 November]] and Britain followed suit on [[5 November]].  Most of the Turkish cabinet members and CUP leaders were against such a rushed entry to the war, but Enver Pa<U+015F>a thought that it was the right thing to do. 

As soon as the war started, [[October 31]], [[1914]], Enver ordered that all men of military age report to army recruiting offices.  The offices were unable to handle the vast flood of men and long delays occurred.  This had the effect of ruining the crop harvest for that year.

=== War Minister ===
Enver proved to be ineffective as War Minister and frequently over the next four years the Germans would have to support the Ottoman government with generals such as [[Otto Liman von Sanders]], [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]], and [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]].  The Germans also gave the Ottoman government military supplies, soldiers, and even fuel. 

Enver Pasha<U+2019>s message to the army and the people was <U+201C>war until final victory<U+201D>.  During the war the living conditions were deteriorated rapidly.  The empire had growing discontent.  The government of [[Committee of Union and Progress]] spent much more than it took in and the inflation rate over the four years of war was greater than 1600%.

=== Defeat at Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>, 1914 ===
{{main|Battle of Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>}}
Enver Pasha assumed command of the Ottoman forces arrayed against the Russians in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus theatre]].  He wanted to encircle the Russians, force them out of Ottoman territory and take back [[Kars]] and [[Batumi]], which had been ceded after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877<U+2013>1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]].  Enver thought of himself as a great military leader, while the German military adviser, [[Otto Liman von Sanders|Liman von Sanders]], thought of him as a military buffoon.<ref name="isbn0-8050-6884-8">{{cite book |author=Fromkin, David |title=A peace to end all peace: the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the modern Middle East |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Vh8r6M8QQMC|publisher=H. Holt |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=119 |isbn=0-8050-6884-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Enver ordered a complex attack on the Russians, placed himself in personal control of the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]], and was utterly defeated at the [[Battle of Sarikamis|Battle of Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>]] in December-January 1914-1915.  His strategy seemed feasible on paper, but he had ignored the external conditions such as the terrain and the weather.  Enver's army (90,000 men) was defeated by the Russian force (100,000 men) and in the subsequent retreat, tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers died. This was the single worst defeat of an Ottoman army in all of [[World War I]].

=== Commanding the forces of the capital 1915 <U+2013> 1918 ===
{{main|Battle of Gallipoli}}
After his defeat at Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>, Enver returned to [[Istanbul]] and took command of the Turkish forces around the capital.  The British and French were planning on forcing the approaches to Istanbul in the hope of knocking the Ottomans out of the war.  A large Allied fleet, largely composed of older battleships unfit for duty against the German [[High Seas Fleet]], assembled and staged an attack on the [[Dardanelles]] on [[March 18]], [[1915]].  The attack (the forerunner to the failed [[Gallipoli campaign]]) left the Turks - and Enver - demoralized. As a result, Enver turned over command to Liman von Sanders, who commanded the successful defense of Gallipoli.

===Army of Islam===
{{main|Democratic Republic of Armenia|Ottoman Army of Islam}}

During 1917, due to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], the Russian army in the [[Caucasus]] had ceased to exist. At the same time, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] managed to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks with the signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (January 1, 1918). Enver looked for victory when Russia withdrew from the Caucasus region. When Enver discussed his plans for taking over southern Russia, the Germans told him to keep out. Undeterred, Enver ordered the creation of a new military force called the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]] which would have no German officers. Enver's Army of Islam avoided Georgia and marched through [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] was also moving forward to pre-war borders.

The [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]], moved towards the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]], which formed the frontline in the Caucasus. General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] was the commander on the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]] and [[Andranik Toros Ozanian]] took the command of Armenia within the Ottoman Empire. [[Vehib Pasha]] forced [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenians]] to retreat and then captured [[Trabzon]], where the Russians had left huge quantities of supplies. Then the army turned towards Georgia.

The Army of Islam, under the control of [[Nuri Pasha]], moved forward and attacked with [[General Lionel Charles Dunsterville]] at [[Baku]]. General Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on September 14, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran; most of the Armenian population escaped with British forces. Ottomans and theirs Azeri allies, after the [[Battle of Baku]], entered the city on [[September 15]]. 

However, after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between [[Great Britain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] on October 30, Ottoman troops were replaced by the [[Triple Entente]]. These conquests in the [[Caucasus]] counted for very little in the war as a whole.

==Armistice and exile==
Faced with defeat, the Sultan dismissed Enver from his post as War Minister on [[4 October]] [[1918]], while the rest Talat Pasha's government resigned on [[14 October]] [[1918]]. On [[October 30]], [[1918]], the Ottoman Empire capitulated by signing the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. Two days later the "[[Three Pashas]]" all fled into exile. On [[1 January]] [[1919]], the new government expelled Enver Pasha from the army. He was tried ''in absentia'' in the [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919-20]] for crimes of <U+201C>plunging the country into war without a legitimate reason, forced deportation of Armenians and leaving the country without permission<U+201D> and condemned to death.<ref>[http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/papazian/misplace.html See link]</ref>

Enver first went to [[Germany]] in October [[1918]] where he communicated and worked with German [[Communist]] figures like [[Karl Radek]]. He envisioned a cooperation between the new [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russian]] government against the British, and went to [[Moscow]]. There he was received well, and established contacts with representatives from [[Central Asia]] and other exiled [[Committee of Union and Progress]] members. He also met with [[Bolshevik]] leaders, including [[Lenin]]. He tried to support the [[Turkish national movement]] and corresponded with [[Mustafa Kemal]], giving him the guarantee that he didn't intend to intervene in the movement in [[Anatolia]]. Enver Pa<U+015F>a went to Baku between 1-8 September 1920 to take part in the failed "Congress of Eastern Peoples", representing Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. He later returned to Berlin where he tried to establish a secret organization that would transfer Russian military assistance to Turkey, an attempt that eventually failed.

==Pan-Turkism and death, 1921-22==
{{main|Basmachi Revolt}}
On [[30 July]] [[1921]], with the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in full swing, Enver decided to return to Anatolia. He went to [[Batumi]] to be close to the new border. However, Mustafa Kemal didn't want him among the [[Turkish revolutionaries]]. Mustafa Kemal had broken with Enver Pasha and the CUP as early as 1914, and he explicitly rejected the pan-Turkic ideas and what Mustafa Kemal perceived as Enver Pasha's utopian goals (see: [[Kemalism]]). Enver Pasha changed his plans and traveled to the [[Russian Turkestan]] to realize his pan-Turkish dreams. There the local Muslims had risen up against the pro-Moscow [[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]] regimes in what became known as the "[[Basmachi Revolt]]". Soon he managed to establish himself as the rebels' supreme commander, and turned their disparate forces into a small but well-drilled army. 

On [[4 August]] [[1922]] however, as he was celebrating the [[Ramadan]] at his headquarters near the village of Ab-<U+0131> Derya near [[Dushanbe]], the Russian forces launched a surprise attack, during which he was killed. 

In [[1996]], his remains were brought to [[Republic of Turkey]] and reburied in [[Istanbul]].
