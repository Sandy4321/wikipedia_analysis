'''Pinky and the Brain''' is an [[animated television series]] and spinoff of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' starring Pinky and the Brain. The show ran from 1995 to 2001 on [[Kids' WB!]]. The pair later spun off into their second and last series, ''[[Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain]]'' and paired with [[Tiny Toons Adventures|Tiny Toons star]], [[Elmyra Duff]].

Pinky and the Brain first appeared in 1993 as a recurring segment on the show ''[[Animaniacs]]''. From 1995 to 2001, Pinky and the Brain were spun off into their own show on [[The WB Television Network]], ''Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky and the Brain'', with 65 episodes produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Later, they appeared in the unsuccessful series, ''Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain''.

Pinky and Brain are [[Genetic engineering|genetically enhanced]] [[laboratory mice]] who reside in a cage in the [[Acme Corporation|Acme Labs]] research facility. Brain is self-centered and [[megalomania|scheming]]; Pinky is good-natured but feebleminded.  In each episode, Brain devises a new plan to [[Hegemony|take over the world]], which ultimately ends in failure, usually due to Pinky's idiocy or the impossibility of Brain's plan. In common with many other ''Animaniacs'' shorts, many episodes are in some way a [[parody]] of something else, usually a film or novel. The opening song is preceded by the following dialogue:

<blockquote>
'''Pinky''': "Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?"<br/>
'''The Brain''': "The same thing we do every night, Pinky<U+2014>'''try to take over the world!'''"</blockquote>

==Background==
===Premise===
Many of the ''Pinky and the Brain'' episodes occur in the present time at Acme Labs, located in some large American metropolitan city near a bridge, presumably [[San Francisco]] to tie in with ''Animaniacs'' and the [[Warner Brothers]] studio lot. However, several episodes took place in historical times, with Pinky and the Brain under the laboratory care of some scientifically-minded person, including [[Merlin]],<ref name="spellbound">{{cite episode | title = Spellbound | episodelink = | series = Animaniacs | serieslink = Animaniacs | airdate = 1993-11-10 | season = 1 | number = 38}}</ref> [[H.G. Wells]]<ref name="miceruled">{{cite episode | title = When Mice Ruled The World | episodelink = | series = Animaniacs | serieslink = Animaniacs | airdate = 1993-11-23 | season = 1 | number = 47}}</ref> and [[Ivan Pavlov]].<ref name="pavlovsmice">{{cite episode | title = Pavlov's Mice | episodelink = | series = Animaniacs | serieslink = Animaniacs | airdate = 1993-10-06 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref>

The bulk of every episode involves one of Brain's plans for [[Hegemony|world domination]] with Pinky's assistance and the ultimate failure of that plan. One centers on his rival Snowball's plan to take over the world using Microsponge.<ref name="snowball"/> Another episode features Brain's single day where he tries to do anything but take over the world: in the end, a group of people vote that he should take over the world on the one day he does not want to.<ref name="brainsnightoff">{{cite episode | title = Brain's Night Off | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-02-21 | season = 3 | number = 52}}</ref>  There is very little [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] between episodes outside of the common fixtures of the mice, though some plans for world domination from early episodes are subsequently referred to in later seasons (for example, Brain's "human suit" used in "Win Big"<ref name="winbig"/> reappears when Brain faces Snowball in "Snowball").<ref name="snowball"/>

Both Pinky and the Brain, white mice kept as part of Acme Labs' experimentation, have undergone significant [[genetics|genetic alteration]]; as per the show's title lyrics, "their genes have been [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]]" which gives the two mice amplified intelligence over that of a typical mouse, the ability to talk to humans, and [[anthropomorphism]].  "Project B.R.A.I.N." suggests that the gene splicing occurred on September 9, 1995,<ref name="projectbrain"/> coincident to the first full episode of ''Pinky and the Brain.'' The episode "Brainwashed" states that the gene splicing was done by [[The Island of Doctor Moreau|Dr. Mordough]], along with Snowball the hamster and Precious the cat, using the Acme "Gene Splicer and [[Bagel]] Warmer."<ref name="brainwashed3">{{cite episode | title = Brainwashed: Wash Harder | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-09-16 | season = 4 | number = 64}}</ref>

Although Pinky and the Brain plan to conquer the world, they do not show much [[wikt:animosity|animosity]]; in a [[Christmas]] special Pinky even wrote to Santa that Brain had the world's best interests at heart.<ref name="xmas">{{cite episode | title = A Pinky and the Brain Christmas | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1995-12-13 | season = 1 | number = 8}}</ref>

==Characters==
===The Brain===
The Brain (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) looks and sounds like [[Orson Welles]]. In "Project B.R.A.I.N." Brain's name is the [[acronym]] for "Biological Recombinant Algorithmic Intelligence Nexus."<ref name="projectbrain">{{cite episode | title = Project B.R.A.I.N. | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-09-28 | season = 3 | number = 59}}</ref> His tail is bent like a staircase<U+2014>he often uses it to pick the lock of his cage<U+2014>and his head is large and wide, housing his abnormally large brain. He is highly intelligent and develops complex plans for [[world government|global domination]], using politics, cultural references, and his own inventions toward his goal. He seems coldly unemotional, speaking in a deadpan. Nevertheless, Brain has a subtle sense of humor and even possesses some Christmas spirit.  He has even fallen in love, with Trudie in the episode "The Third Mouse", and with Billie in "The World Can Wait." <ref name="worldcanwait">{{cite episode | title = The World Can Wait | episodelink = | series = Animaniacs | serieslink = Animaniacs | airdate = 1993-11-18 | season = 1 | number = 44}}</ref>
Brain has been compared to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]<ref name="brainaparte">{{cite episode | title = Napoleon Brainaparte | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1995-11-26 | season = 1 | number = 7}}</ref> and [[Don Quixote]].<ref name="lamancha">{{cite episode | title = The Mouse of La Mancha | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1996-02-25 | season = 1 | number = 12}}</ref>

Brain sees his inevitable rise to power as good for the world, and not mere [[megalomania]]. In [[Wakko's Wish]], he said to Pinky "We're on our way to fame, fortune and a world that's a better place for all."  However, his motives are not pure. In one episode, Brain finds himself hypnotized by a psychologist he had planned to manipulate for one of his schemes, none other than [[Sigmund Freud]].  There Brain reveals that he originally lived with his parents in a tin can. Researchers took him from his home: the last he saw was a picture of the world on the side of the can. Dr. [[Sigmund Freud]] speculates that Brain's hunger to take over the world stems from wanting to go back home to his parents.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Leggo My Ego | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1997-11-07 | season = 3 | number = 44}}</ref>

===Pinky===
Pinky (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]], using a [[cockney]] accent) is another genetically modified mouse who shares the same cage at Acme Labs, but is much more dim. He speaks with an exaggerated [[cockney]] accent. He has several verbal [[tic]]s, such as ''"narf"'', ''"zort"'', ''"poit"'', and ''"troz"'' (the last of which he started saying after noticing it was "''zort'' in the mirror"). Pinky has a straight tail, blue eyes, and a severe overbite, and is taller than the Brain.  Pinky's name is given to him by Brain, thinking that Brain was calling him when, in fact, Brain was referring to his [[pinky finger|pinky digit]].<ref name="projectbrain"/>

Pinky is more open-minded than the Brain and much happier. Troubles never ruin his day, mostly because he is too scatter-brained to notice them. He helps Brain toward world domination, even though Brain insults him and often hits him on the head. Pinky actually seems to enjoy this, laughing after he is hit. He is happy just being with his best friend.  He is obsessed with trivia, spending a lot of time watching [[television]] and following [[popular culture]] fads. This [[detritus]] is in the place of the Brain's rigorous logic.  However, the Brain's schemes have sometimes tapped into this knowledge.  Sometimes Pinky even finds non-rational solutions to problems.  He has a number of unusual special abilities, something like 'magic', perhaps caused by his genetic engineering. He occasionally levitates, and also is apparently capable of telekinesis, as seen when he levitated several pieces of fruit in a bowl.

===Other characters===
{{anchor|Snowball}}
The show featured a few recurring characters.  Snowball the [[hamster]] (voiced by [[Roddy McDowall]]) is Brain's former friend, also made intelligent by gene splicing.  He has also developed a desire for world conquest, and Pinky and the Brain are sometimes forced to stop Snowball's schemes.<ref name="snowball">{{cite episode | title = Snowball | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1996-01-20 | season = 1 | number = 7}}</ref>  Billie (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is a female mouse, another result of gene splicing.  She is smarter than Brain, and makes him afraid she will beat him to his goal of world domination.<ref name="worldcanwait"/>  He loves her: she fancies Pinky. Pharfignewton (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a racing [[mare (horse)|mare]] who Pinky falls in love with.<ref name="jockey">{{cite episode | title = Jockey for Position | episodelink = | series = Animaniacs | serieslink = Animaniacs | airdate = 1995-10-25 | season = 1 | number = 27}}</ref> (Her name is reminiscent of Farfelkugel, Broomhilde's horse from the 1993 [[Mel Brooks]] spoof ''[[Robin Hood: Men In Tights]]'', and can be taken as a [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]] of [[Volkswagen]]'s "[[Fahrvergn<U+00FC>gen]]" slogan, the racehorse [[Phar Lap]], and [[Kugel]] a Jewish pudding or casserole.)  Larry (voiced by [[Billy West]], when he's using the same voice as Stimpy from [[Ren and Stimpy]]) is a white mouse like [[Larry Fine|Larry]] of [[The Three Stooges]] inexplicably present in certain episodes.<ref name="larry">{{cite episode | title = Pinky and the Brain<U+2026>and Larry | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1997-09-13 | season = 3 | number = 28}}</ref><ref name="reunionspecial">{{cite episode | title = The Pinky and the Brain Reunion Special | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-09-21 | season = 3 | number = 61}}</ref> He was created as a response to demand from Kids WB executives to include additional characters on the show.<ref name="hastings"/>

Other characters that have appeared on the show have included both Brain's parents,<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Visit | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1996-05-12 | season = 1 | number = 13}}</ref> and Pinky's parents and "sister" (an empty spool of thread),<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Family That Poits Together, Narfs Together | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-02-21 | season = 3 | number = 53}}</ref> and their "child", "Roman Numeral I" (Romy for short) who was a result of a cloning mistake.  Later seasons also feature recurring caricatures of celebrities, including both [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Christopher Walken]].

==Creation and inspiration==
[[Image:Pinky-and-the-brain-caricatures.png|right|thumb|Caricatures of Minton (left) and Fitzgerald from "The Pinky and the Brain Reunion Special"]]
''Pinky and the Brain'' was inspired by the peculiar personalities of two of producer Tom Ruegger's ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' colleagues, [[Eddie Fitzgerald]] and [[Tom Minton]], respectively.<ref name="hastingskidswb">{{cite newsgroup

While Ruegger initially based The Brain after Minton, the Welles connection came from Maurice LaMarche, a big fan of the actor/director, who had supplied the voice for Orson Welles in the 1994 movie ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. LaMarche describes Brain's voice as "65% Orson Welles, 35% [[Vincent Price]]".<ref>{{cite web

A caricature of Orson Welles appears in a late episode of the series ("What Ever Happened to Baby Brain"), echoing a rant of the Brain's and introducing himself afterwards.<ref name="battlefortheplanet">{{cite episode | title = Battle For the Planet | episodelink = | series = Animaniacs | serieslink = Animaniacs | airdate = 1993-10-01 | season = 1 | number = 15}}</ref>

It was developed for ''Animaniacs,'' written by Ruegger with a script by Peter Hastings, and directed by Rusty Mills. According to Ruegger, most of the elements that would become part of ''Pinky and the Brain'' can be found in Hastings's original script.  It held many dialog bits that became conventions of the entire series,<ref name="hastingskidswb"/> including Brain's "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?", Pinky's "Oh wait<U+2026>but no<U+2026>" in response to a plan, and Pinky's final question, "What are we doing tomorrow night?"

==Production==
===Producers===
As with ''Animaniacs'', Steven Spielberg was the executive producer during the entire run, Tom Ruegger was the senior producer, Jean MacCurdy was the executive in charge of production, and Andrea Romano was the voice director. Peter Hastings and Rusty Mills produced the show when it was spun off from Animaniacs, as well as the season it ran primetime on the WB.  After the first season Hastings left the show and Mills took over as the supervising producer.

===Writing===
The original Pinky and the Brain shorts on ''Animaniacs'' were written primarily by Peter Hastings. Upon moving into its own show, the writing staff included Gordon Bressack, Charles M. Howell IV, Earl Kress, Wendell Morris, and Tom Sheppard. Comedienne [[Alex Borstein]] was also a staff writer, years before her fame on ''[[MADTV]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''. Classic Warner Bros. cartoon director [[Norm McCabe]] also wrote for the show.

===Voicing===
[[Image:Annie Awards Rob paulsen and maurice lamarche.jpg|upright|thumb|Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche together at the [[34th Annie Awards]] red carpet.]]
Pinky and the Brain were voiced by Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche, respectively. The series also used the work of many of the same voice actors for ''Animaniacs'' including [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Jess Harnell]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Jeff Bennett]], as well as Paul Rugg, [[Billy West]], and [[Jim Cummings]].
Celebrities such as [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Nora Dunn]], [[Townsend Coleman]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Steve Allen]], [[Joyce Brothers]], [[Gavin MacLeod]], [[John Tesh]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Garry Marshall]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[James Belushi]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] have all performed guest voice work for the series as well.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-06-25 }}</ref>  [[Cree Summer]] has also voiced characters in ''Pinky and the Brain'' and reprised her role as Elmyra during ''Pinky, Elmyra, and The Brain''.

===Music===
As with ''Animaniacs'', Pinky and the Brain was scored by a team of composers, led by supervising composer Richard Stone.  This team included Steve and Julie Bernstein, who also orchestrated and sometimes conducted the 40-piece orchestra. The recordings were done on Stage A on the Warner Bros lot, the same stage (and with the same piano) where Carl Stalling recorded his Looney Tunes music.  The theme music for ''Pinky and the Brain'' was composed by Richard Stone with lyrics by Tom Ruegger.<ref name="hastingskidswb"/>

Two versions of the opening sequence and theme, with slightly different lyrics, were used during ''Animaniacs'' shorts. In the first version, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]] (voiced respectively by Paulsen, Harnell, and MacNeille) popped up in the lab and sang the theme while letting the two mice out of their cage. The second, later version had the singers off-camera as the Brain picked the lock on the cage door to free himself and Pinky. On the ''Pinky and the Brain'' show, the theme gained an additional two verses and was sung by Gene Paul, mind and others.

The score sometimes includes references to classical music.  For example, in the episode where the Brain builds a new [[Papier-m<U+00E2>ch<U+00E9>]] Earth, the theme from the 2nd and 4th movements of [[Antonin Dvorak|Dvorak]]'s '[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k)|New World Symphony]]' can be heard throughout the episode.<ref>{{cite episode | title = It's Only a Paper World | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1996-09-07 | season = 2 | number = 14}}</ref> The episode ''Napoleon Brainaparte'' makes frequent reference to the French anthem, [[La Marseillaise]],<ref name="brainaparte"/> while in the episode in which Pinky becomes the artist "Pinkasso" [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' can be heard.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Pinkasso | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1996-09-14 | season = 2 | number = 15}}</ref>

===Animation===
Like ''Animaniacs'', most of the original ''Pinky and the Brain'' shorts used a variety of animation studios, including [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]], [[StarToons]], [[Wang Film Productions]], Freelance Animators New Zealand, and [[AKOM]]. However, the bulk of the episodes created outside of ''Animaniacs'' (seasons 2 and beyond) were produced by [[Rough Draft Studios]] and Wang Film Productions. The only episode that was animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha on the spin-off was ''A Pinky and the Brain Christmas''.

===Humor===
{{see also|Animaniacs#Hallmarks_and_humor|l1=Hallmarks of Animaniacs}}

Like ''Animaniacs'', much of the humor in ''Pinky and the Brain'' was aimed at adult audiences.  [[Parody|Parodies]] of pop culture icons were quite common on the series, more so during the original episodes developed for the WB prime time slot. In addition to previously mentioned political and actor caricatures, some episodes included complete parodies like those in ''Animaniacs''. The episode "The Megalomaniacal Adventures of Brainie the Poo" parodies [[Winnie The Pooh]]. "Cameos" include [[Mick Jagger|Jagger]] instead of [[Tigger]] and [[Al Gore]] instead of [[Eeyore]]. Al Gore is "full of hot air", floating like a balloon. Other parodic elements include [[Christopher Walken]] in place of [[Christopher Robin]] and the "Brainie the Poo" book appears to have been authored by "[[Alcoholics Anonymous|A.A.]] Meeting."<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Megalomaniacal Adventures of Brainie the Poo |episodelink= |series=Pinky and the Brain |serieslink=Pinky and the Brain |credits= |network= |station= |airdate=1998-02-07 |season=3 |number=51 |minutes= }}</ref>  The three-part "Brainwashed" episode included several allusions to ''[[The Prisoner]]'' television show, though everyone in The Village was identified by the hat they wore, and not by number.<ref name="brainwashed1">{{cite episode | title = Brainwashed: Brain, Brain Go Away | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-09-02 | season = 4 | number = 62}}</ref><ref name="brainwashed2">{{cite episode | title = Brainwashed: I Am Not a Hat | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-09-10 | season = 4 | number = 63}}</ref>

Three songs resemble the musical skits in ''Animaniacs,'' matching existing music with new lyrics.  Pinky sings "Cheese Roll Call" to [[John Philip Sousa]]'s march "[[Semper Fidelis]]" praising his love for all [[cheese]]s from around the world.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Cheese Roll Call | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1995-10-01 | season = 1 | number = 4}}</ref>  To the music of "[[Camptown Races]]," Brain lists the major parts of the human [[brain]], with Pinky jumping in at the chorus to shout "Brainstem! Brainstem!".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Brainstem | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1995-09-17 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref>  "A Meticulous Analysis of History" is set to "When I Was a Lad" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', and sung by both Brain and Pinky, with Brain reciting the rise to power of such historical leaders as [[Napoleon]] and [[Cleopatra]], while Pinky mentions how they all fell.<ref>{{cite episode | title = A Meticulous Analysis of History | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1997-09-20 | season = 3 | number = 31}}</ref> In addition, "Brainwashed" featured a song called the Schm<U+00EB>ersk<U+00E5>h<U+00F8>v<U+00EA>n, a parody of the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]], which would brainwash you if done correctly. The song include such odd lyrics as "Put your fingers in your ears then stick them in your belly" and "Bop yourself on the head and cross your eyes."

Like ''Animaniacs,'' there was a gag credit in the [[closing credits]]: each show featured an English word appropriate for the episode with its definition. For example, "Around the World in 80 Narfs", where the mice are foiled by trying to speak "cabbie" and end up going in circles, the gag credit word was "anophelosis" defined as "morbid state due to extreme frustration."<ref name="80narfs">{{cite episode | title = Around the World in 80 Narfs | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1996-02-03 | season = 1 | number = 10}}</ref>

Another common element in nearly each episode is the following exchange (often referred to by the acronym "AYPWIP"):
<blockquote>'''Brain:''' Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?<br>'''Pinky:''' I think so, Brain, but...</blockquote>
Pinky's response ends with a [[Non sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur]] such as, "we're already naked," "isn't a [[cucumber]] that small called a [[gherkin]]?" or "if they called them [[Happy Meal|sad meals]], kids wouldn't buy them."  Brain would then become furious, often bashing Pinky over the head. Twice in the series Pinky and Brain indeed pondered the same thing, though in one of these Pinky dismissed his idea as being too stupid.  Just one time the answer was "Yes!"

==Response==
===Popularity===
Pinky and the Brain were popular on ''Animaniacs,'' and the popularity continued into their own series. It attracted many of the same fans as ''Animaniacs,'' and [[Internet]] outreach attracted more. Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen appeared on voice actor tours around the Warner Bros. Studio Stores.

In an interview on the third DVD volume, LaMarche and Paulsen noted that Roy Langbord (vice-president of [[Showtime]]), [[Al Franken]], and [[Barenaked Ladies]] are fans of the shows.<ref>{{cite video | people = Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen | title = "It's All About the Fans" extra on "Pinky and the Brain Volume 3" | medium = DVD | publisher = | location = | date = 2007-06-19 }}</ref>

The [[Rice University]] [[Neologism]] dictionary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esa4.rice.edu/~ling215/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070630221313/http://esa4.rice.edu/~ling215/ |archivedate=2007-06-30 |title=Rice University Neologism Dictionary |accessdate=2007-06-29 |work= }}</ref> includes not only "narf" as a random sound or [[nonce word]], but also "narfed" as a verb to mean "to be struck completely" with some embarrassment or folly, much as Pinky would be hit on the head by Brain after his follies ruined Brain's plan. Both words are directly attributed to ''Pinky and the Brain''. The International Dictionary of Neologisms<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neologisms.us/ |title=International Dictionary of Neologisms |accessdate=2007-06-29 |work= }}</ref> includes the word "narfistic" as "an idea or concept that works fine when you think about it <U+2013> but is very difficult to express to someone else", as a result of Pinky only saying "Narf!" after Brain elaborates on one of his extensive plans.

Pinky and the Brain appear in the post-apocalyptic roleplaying game Fallout2 by Interplay, portrayed as a sibling couple of mutant albino mole rats. One creature is utterly insane, muttering intentions of taking rulership. The other is a highly intelligent cult leader who has intricate plans to claim domination of the post-apocalyptic world, he also has a taste for cheezy poofs.

Pinky and the Brain were alluded to in ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #438 as two white mice, kept by Omnibus. One of the realistically drawn mice had an enlarged cranium, and when their cage was destroyed the sound "narf" is indicated. Also when Jailbait asked what they would do during the night Hotshot replied "The same thing they do every night...whatever that is". Omnibus claims that he is being haunted by The Leader, but once the mice have escaped their cage, the "ghost" of the Leader is silenced and Omnibus is robbed of his brilliant schemes for world domination.

The [[Virgin New Adventures]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novel, ''[[Death and Diplomacy]]'' by [[Dave Stone]] includes two characters repeating the "Are you pondering<U+2026>" lines, and near the end, two of the fallen villains in the story recover, one telling his comrade that they must prepare for tomorrow night when they will take over the universe.

''This is Not a Game'', a novel by Walter Jon Williams begins "Plush dolls of Pinky and the Brain overhung Charlie's Monitor..." and the theme of world domination is central to the plot.

==History==
===On ''Animaniacs'' and ''Pinky and the Brain''===
{{Main|List of Pinky and the Brain episodes|Animaniacs}}
Pinky and the Brain first appeared as a recurring segment on the animated series ''Animaniacs'', another show produced by Steven Spielberg. On September 14, 1993, Pinky and the Brain premiered on television in the episode ''Win Big'', which aired on [[Cartoon Cartoon Show|The What-A-Cartoon!Show]].

On September 8, 1995, ''Pinky and the Brain'' were spun off onto their own half-hour series on [[Kids' WB]], with each episode consisting of one or more segments, including some of the segments from ''Animaniacs''. The first season of the show was scheduled in a [[prime time|prime-time]] slot from September 8, 1995 through May 12, 1996 as part of the new [[WB Network]] lineup, and as a result, tended to have more jokes and humor aimed to adults rather than children. However, due to poor ratings, subsequent seasons were moved to Saturday mornings as part of the ''Kids' WB'' programming block.

Even though they had their own show, they still had several shorts in Animaniacs after they got the show, they still appeared in the shows intro, and often appeared in cameo appearances.

Around 1997 the overall structure within the WB Network changed, including the placement of [[Jamie Kellner]] as head of the ''Kids WB'' programming. Along with this came pressure on the writers of the show to back off on the idea of world domination and to include more characters on the show.<ref name="hastings">{{cite web| url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/kidzone/fuzzyheads.html| title=Platypus Comix article on ''Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain''| last =| first =  |date= | work =Platypus Comix|accessdate=2006-06-16}}</ref>  The episode "Pinky and the Brain ... and Larry"<ref name="larry"/> was a response to this pressure.<ref name="hastings"/>  At this point, Peter Hastings, a key writer for the series, decided to quit the show, with his last script being, "You'll Never Eat Food Pellets In This Town, Again!" directly addressing the issue of networks trying to retool shows that otherwise work already.<ref name="hastings"/><ref>{{cite episode | title = You'll Never Eat Food Pellets In This Town, Again! | episodelink = | series = Pinky and the Brain | serieslink = Pinky and the Brain | airdate = 1998-04-25 | season = 3 | number = 50}}</ref>

With increased pressure from the WB network, the series was retooled on September 19, 1998 into ''Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain'', in which Pinky and the Brain were owned by ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures|Tiny Toons]]'' character [[Elmyra Duff]]; the unusual change in format was even sarcastically noted in the altered title song. The show lasted for 13 episodes, 5 of which were shown whole and 6 of which were chopped into segments and aired as part of ''[[The Cat&Birdy Warneroonie PinkyBrainy Big Cartoonie Show]]''.

The characters' final appearance was in the 1999 direct-to-video ''Animaniacs'' feature, ''[[Wakko's Wish]]''.

===Cancellation and syndication===
After ''Pinky and the Brain'' and ''Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain'' were canceled from Kids' WB!, [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] acquired [[TV syndication|syndication]] rights to broadcast all 65 episodes of ''Pinky and the Brain'' on their network, and later on [[Nicktoons TV]], beginning on September 4, 2000.<ref name="nick1">{{cite web | url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785754.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=animaniacs| title =Toon web sans synergy: WB sells to Nick: Cartoon Network turns down Spielberg-produced skeins| accessdate = 2007-04-30| author =John Dempsey | last = | first =  |date=August 30, 2000 | month = August | work =Variety.com | publisher = Reed Business Information | quote =}}</ref><ref name="nick2">{{cite web | url =http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,667814,00.html| title =Nickelodeon Acquires Exclusive Television Rights to Warner Bros.

During 2003, ''Pinky and the Brain'' aired on [[Boomerang (American TV channel)|Boomerang]] (also owned by [[Time Warner]]) with the theme song unaltered. It continued to air on Boomerang and Nicktoons Network until 2005 when it was taken off both channels.  It was later aired on [[Toon Disney]]'s [[Jetix]] block from October 2007 until September 2008. On February 15, 2009, ''Pinky and the Brain'' was returned on weekend late nights at 3:00AM ET/2:00AM CT on [[Disney XD (United States)|Disney XD]], but was taken off the channel on June 15, 2009.

During 2006, ''Pinky and the Brain'', among other Kids' WB! shows, was broadcast on the AOL broadband channel, In2TV.<ref name="in2tv">{{cite web|url= http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1220659,00.html |title= AOL to Launch New Video Portal |work= TimeWarner Newsroom | author= |publisher= TimeWarner | date = 2006-07-31|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> However, as of 2007, ''Pinky and the Brain'' is no longer a featured series on the site.

In Canada, ''Pinky and the Brain'' is currently airing on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] having started on September 3, 2007. The theme song is presented unaltered.

Also in Australia, ''Pinky and the Brain'' had aired on [[GO! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]] from  21 December 2009 - 18th June 2010. The theme song was also presented unaltered.

==Merchandise==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
''Pinky and the Brain'', along with ''Animaniacs'', aired coincident with the formation of [[The Warner Bros. Studio Store]] chain across the United States, and, as a result, numerous [[t-shirt]]s, coffee mugs, [[stuffed animal]]s, animation [[cel]]s, and original artwork from the show were available through these outlets. Other merchandise included comic books, computer games, and video tapes. When Warner Brothers acquired the [[Hanna-Barbera]] animation properties in 1998, there was a significant decrease with such merchandise through the store. By the time the series was canceled, very little merchandise was available.

===VHS releases===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
Five [[VHS]] collections of ''Pinky and the Brain'' episodes were released from 1993 to 1995: ''A Pinky and the Brain Christmas'', ''Cosmic Attractions'', ''Mice of the Jungle'', ''World Domination Tour'', and ''You Will Buy This Video!'', each with approximately 4 episodes that including both Pinky and the Brain shorts from ''Animaniacs'' and their own show. These collections are now out of print.

===DVD releases===
[[Warner Home Video]] has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 in 3 volume sets.

''Pinky and the Brain'' were also regulars in the ''Animaniacs'' comic book published by [[DC Comics]]. From July 1996 through November 1998, they starred in their own comic book also published by DC Comics, which ran for 27 issues before cancellation. Following the cancellation of the ''Pinky and the Brain'' comic, the mice later starred in stories that took up half of the later ''Animaniacs'' issues, which, starting at issue #43, was retitled ''Animaniacs featuring Pinky and the Brain'', and ran for another 16 issues before cancellation.

===Computer games===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
There are a couple of computer games dedicated to ''Pinky and the Brain'', called ''Pinky and the Brain: World Conquest'' for the PC, produced by SouthPeak Interactive and distributed by Warner Bros. However, the characters have appeared in several of the ''Animaniacs'' games, such as ''[[Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt]]''.

''Pinky and the Brain''  also star in their own Gameboy Advance game, ''[http://www.mobygames.com/game/pinky-and-the-brain-the-master-plan Pinky and the Brain: The Master Plan]''. The game was produced by Warthog, and distributed by SWING! Entertainment in 2002.

In the computer game ''[[Fallout 2]]'' the character may encounter an albino mole-rat that calls himself "The Brain".<ref>{{cite web | url =http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Brain| title =Brain - The Vault, the Fallout wiki| accessdate = 2009-08-27| author =Pawe<U+0142> Dembowski| last = Dembowski| first = Pawe<U+0142>|date=June 19, 2006 | month = June | work = | publisher = | quote =}}</ref> "The Brain" created a cult that attempts to restore the humanity of the ghoul characters (humans that were badly damaged by radiation), by a process referred to as "Renewal". By doing so "The Brain" hopes to take over the world. The player can engage in dialogue with "The Brain", with one of the dialogue possibilities being, "Big plans for an oversized rat".

===Music===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
While ''Pinky and the Brain'' does not feature as many songs as ''Animaniacs'', some of the music from the show can be found across the three ''Animaniacs'' CDs. An expanded version of the episode "Bubba Bo Bob Brain" presented in a [[radio drama]] or [[audiobook]] fashion was released as a CD in 1997 by [[Rhino Entertainment]].
