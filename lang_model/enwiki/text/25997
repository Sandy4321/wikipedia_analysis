A '''kame''' is a [[geology|geological]] feature, an irregularly shaped [[hill]] or [[mound]] composed of sorted or stratified [[sand]] and [[gravel]] that is deposited in contact with the glacial ice. It can have an irregular shape. Kames are often associated with [[kettle (geology)|kettle]]s, and this is referred to as ''kame and kettle'' topography.

When the ice retreats further, the delta kame often collapses. Kame terraces are frequently found along the side of a glacial valley and are the deposits of meltwater streams flowing between the ice and the adjacent valley side.

Kames are sometimes compared to [[drumlin]]s, but their formation is distinctively different. A drumlin is not originally shaped by meltwater, but by the ice itself and has a quite regular shape. It occurs in fine grained material, such as [[clay]] or [[shale]], not in sands and gravels. And drumlins usually have concentric layers of material, as the ice successively plasters new layers in its movement.  

Kames are not normally located in proximity to one another, however in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] numerous kames are found nearby, forming the [[Prosser Archaeological Site]]. The [[Fonthill Kame]] in southern [[Ontario]] is in a densely populated area. In the United States examples can be found in [[Wisconsin]] and at the [[Sims Corner Eskers and Kames|Sims Corner Eskers and Kames National Natural Landscape]] in [[Washington]].
