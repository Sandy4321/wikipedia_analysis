'''Brazilian rock''' refers to [[rock music]] produced in [[Brazil]] and usually sung in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Brazilian rock has one of the most important histories.
Rock entered the [[Brazil]]ian scene in 1956, with the screening of the film ''[[The Blackboard Jungle]]'', featuring [[Bill Haley]]'s "[[Rock Around the Clock]]", which would later be covered by the singer [[Nora Ney]]<ref>{{cite web  | last = Cravo Albin | first = Ricardo | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Dicion<U+00E1>rio Cravo Albin da M<U+00FA>sica Popular Brasileira | work =  | publisher = Instituto Cultural Cravo Albin | date =  | url = http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/detalhe.asp?nome=Nora+Ney&tabela=T_FORM_A&qdetalhe=art | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref> and have a [[Brazilian Portuguese|Portuguese]] version. In 1957 [[Miguel Gustavo]] wrote the first original rock 'n' roll song "Rock and roll em Copacabana", recorded by [[Cauby Peixoto]]. The song was #52 in the year's charts<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Hot100Brasil | work =  | publisher = Hot100Brasil | date =  | url = http://www.hot100brasil.com/timemachine1957.html | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref>. Other rock artists of the 1950s were [[Celly Campelo]] and [[Sergio Murilo]], singing covers and versions from the [[United States]] and [[Italy]]. 

The electric guitar already was used in Brazil in 1948, in [[Bahia]] State, [[Salvador]] city, by [[Dod<U+00F4> e Osmar]]: they invented the famous "pau el<U+00E9>trico" - the first electric guitar of the world without microphonic feedback, with its typical acute color characteristic and sustained sound, no more similar to the previous jazzistic electric guitar models (then they developed another with two arms) and in 1949 they played carnival songs with this guitar at the first time in an open car named then "[[Trio El<U+00E9>trico]]" on the Salvador streets (today is in a big trucks with a very robust sound).

Throughout the 1960s rock music was marginalized as crude and [[Imperialism|imperialistic]]. This stance led several [[MPB]] artists to participate in a protest that would later be called the ''passeata contra a guitarra el<U+00E9>trica'' ("demonstration against the [[electric guitar]]")<ref name="rcd">{{cite book  | last = Ara<U+00FA>jo | first = Paulo C<U+00E9>sar de | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Roberto Carlos em detalhes | publisher = Editora Planeta do Brasil | date = 2006 | location = S<U+00E3>o Paulo | pages =  | url =  | doi =  | id = ISBN 85-7665-225-5 }}</ref>. Thanks to the combined influence of [[Tropic<U+00E1>lia]], [[The Beatles]] and the increasing acceptance of electric guitars, this position diminished to the point that [[Clube da Esquina]] could produce Beatles-influenced songs and still be regarded as "serious music".

During the 1980s, a new generation of rockers influenced by punk, post-punk and new wave, positioning themselves against MPB (much as punk did against [[progressive rock]])<ref name="brock">{{cite book  | last = Dapieve | first = Arthur | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = BRock - o rock brasileiro dos anos 80 | publisher = DBA | date = 2000 | location = S<U+00E3>o Paulo | pages =  | url =  | doi =  | id = ISBN 85-7234-253-2 }}</ref> achieved mainstream success, even producing the best selling album in Brazilian history: [[R<U+00E1>dio Pirata ao vivo]] by [[RPM (Brazilian band)|RPM]] sold about 2,200,000 copies<ref name="brock"/>. The initial antagonism turned to cross-pollination when [[MPB]] musicians ([[Jo<U+00E3>o Gilberto]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Ney Matogrosso]]) recorded songs by the new bands, while the latter experimented with fusions between Rock, [[Forr<U+00F3>]], [[Samba]], [[Reggae]] and [[Bossa nova]]<ref name="brock"/><ref name="notrop">{{cite book  | last = Motta | first = Nelson | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Noites Tropicais | publisher = Objetiva | date = 2001 | location = Rio de Janeiro | pages =  | url =  | doi =  | id = ISBN 85-7302-292-2 }}</ref>.

Actually the most popular artists from the early times are [[Roberto Carlos]] and [[Raul Seixas]]. From the recent times names like [[Angra]], [[Sepultura]] and [[Legi<U+00E3>o Urbana]] are the most liked.      

==Early period==
In 1957 [[Miguel Gustavo]] wrote the first original rock 'n' roll song "[[Rock and roll em Copacabana]]", recorded by [[Cauby Peixoto]] and #52 on the year's charts.

In Brazil many bands continued to perform translations of English lyrics, though many avoided this problem by playing [[instrumental rock]]. Inspired by such instrumental bands [[Duane Eddy]] and [[The Champs]], 1958 saw the release of the first Brazilian instrumental rock song, "Here's the Blue Jean Rockers" by [[The Blue Jean Rockers]].  Later that year, [[Bol<U+00E3>o & His Rockettes]] recorded the first purely instrumental LP.  This helped make rock the most popular style of Brazilian youth music.  More bands, like [[The Avalons]], [[The Clevers]], [[The Rebels (brazilian band)]], [[The Jordans]], [[The Jet Blacks]], [[The Pops]], [[Os Populares]], [[The Bells (brazilian band)]], [[The Lions (band)]] and [[The Youngs]], arose.

==1959==
1959 was a breakthrough year for '''[[Brazil]]ian [[rock and roll]]''' as its pioneers emerged and became true stars. Out of thousands of performers, [[Nora Ney]], [[Nick Savoia]], [[Celly Campelo]], [[Tony Campelo]], [[Lana Bittencourt]], [[Demetrius (brazilian rocker)]], Cinderella, [[Regiane]], [[Ronnie Cord]] and [[Hamilton de Giorgio]] climbed to success seemingly overnight. A number of instrumental bands like [[The Avalons]], [[The Rebels (brazilian band)]], [[The Jordans]] and "[[Os incr<U+00ED>veis]]" became girls<U+00B4> heart-throbs. They enjoyed the same success in Brazil as the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] did in Europe and America years later.

The [[Jackson do Pandeiro]] hit, "Chiclete com Banana" (Gum with Banana), was the first song that try to make a cross between  Brazilian music, in this case the northeast traditional [[Xote]], with North American [[Rock and roll]].

==Social development==
Right after rock'n'roll took America by storm, [[Bill Haley]] and [[Elvis Presley]] also became liberating icons for Brazilian youth.  The youth of Brazil felt that they were under sexual and educational oppression, as Brazilian society had been based on the standards and rules of the [[Catholic church]] colonization. For example, looking at a strange boy or girl in public meant falling into public disgrace. With the advent of rock'n'roll, the Brazilian world began to change. Teenagers were not "only to be seen but not heard" anymore. However, the youth's first reaction was violent. Many movie theaters were totally wrecked during the showing of rock'n'roll movies. This went on for a couple of years until finally the young people decided that if American kids could do it, why couldn't they? So, some radio disc-jockeys and recording companies set out to find new talents that could not only sing but who would also do it in perfect [[English language|English]].

This new social era led to a total transformation of customs, and outlived many other attempts to keep Brazil's social structure rooted in the older traditions and religious dogmas.

[[Raul Seixas]] still in [[Salvador, Bahia]] - where he began to play rock'n'roll influenced by [[Elvis Presley]] music already by the final 1950s but with the incentive of the regional [[Luiz Gonzaga]] music too - formed the first rock band from this city in 1965, [[The Panthers]] and then [[Raulzito e os Panteras]].

In 1963, [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] had two hits: "[[Splish Splash (Brazilian version)|Splish Splash]]" (Portuguese lyrics by [[Erasmo Carlos]] for the [[Bobby Darin]] song) and [[Parei na contram<U+00E3>o]], the first Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos collaboration<ref name="rcd"/>. Roberto and Erasmo created a style that was named [[Jovem Guarda]] then. The beginning of the [[Jovem Guarda]], with [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Erasmo Carlos]] and [[Wanderlea]] (a woman singer), was as a kind of Brazilian version of the North American garage bands in the 60's but with a bit of [[Motown]] soul influence, from [[Otis Redding]] for example. Also [[Ronnie Von]] started his career with the garage influence of [[Jovem Guarda]] and his work uleashed on the psychedelic style and he was who suggested the name of the band, [[Os Mutantes]]. [[Jerry Adriani]] is identified like [[Jovem Guarda]] too, but his influence on Brazilian rock is great with his [[Italian rock]]/pop style: he brought [[Raul Seixas]] from [[Salvador, Bahia]], to success afterwards in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and influenced, for example, one of the best singer of B-rock, [[Renato Russo]] in the 1980s, from [[Legi<U+00E3>o Urbana]] band. About [[Jovem Guarda]] see also [[Eduardo Ara<U+00FA>jo]] and his wife [[Sylvinha Ara<U+00FA>jo]], [[Martinha]], [[Os Incr<U+00ED>veis]], [[Golden Boys]], [[Os Vips]], [[The Fevers]].

[[Jorge Ben]] (then [[Jorge Benjor]]) had several hits and transited between [[Jovem Guarda]] and a new form of playing guitar, with a rhythmic form that he invented. This new style was named [[Samba-rock]]. See also [[Banda Black Rio]], [[Trio Mocot<U+00F3>]], [[Luiz Wagner]], [[Bebeto (musician)]] and [[Wilson Simonal]].

The band [[The Bubbles]], arose in 1965 from [[Rio de Janeiro]], was the link between the garage rock of [[Jovem Guarda]] and the [[Psychedelia]]. In [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] there was the band [[Os Baob<U+00E1>s]] that recorded songs of the [[Kinks]], [[Love (band)]], [[Turtles (band)]] and [[Rolling Stones]] when this bands were still in the beginning of their activities. From the 1960s is also [[Os Primitivos]] with a mix of [[Byrds]] style with Brazilian northeast folk music. 

In the legendary show named [[Opini<U+00E3>o]] from 1964, the first Brazilian genuine musical, [[Z<U+00E9> K<U+00E9>ti]] represented the black people, [[Jo<U+00E3>o do Vale]] the northeast guy and [[Nara Le<U+00E3>o]] (then substituted by [[Maria Beth<U+00E2>nia]]) represents the woman from the Brazilian high society. The inovattive proposal of this show changed the brazilian music forever from that post [[Bossa Nova]] period because introduced other brazilian genres in the pop music. Sometimes with the  protest characteristic the [[MPB]] ([[M<U+00FA>sica Popular Brasileira]]) base was formed: [[Chico Buarque]], [[Edu Lobo]], [[Geraldo Vandr<U+00E9>]], [[S<U+00E9>rgio Ricardo]], [[MPB4]], [[Quarteto em Cy]] and [[Joyce (singer)]], arising from [[Bossa Nova]], in spite of the music is not rock, their collaboration is important on almost all popular urban genres, including the rock. In 1969, [[Marcos Valle]], that belonged to the second generation of the Bossa Nova, change his style to a [[Psychedelic rock]] and [[Soul music]] Brazilian concept, and his brother [[Paulo S<U+00E9>rgio Valle]] went in a similar way. 

The [[Tropic<U+00E1>lia]] movement turned the psychedelic rock and the use of electric instruments more popular in the Brazilian music. Some "tropicalistas" were: [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Tom Z<U+00E9>]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Rog<U+00E9>rio Duprat]], [[Nara Le<U+00E3>o]], etc... The seminal "tropicalista" [[Os Mutantes]] influenced and tended for the psychedelic rock'n'roll and is one reference for several relevant bands and musicians in the world. 

The already mentioned "[[Clube da Esquina]]", a group of friends from [[Minas Gerais]], one of the most culturally prolific regions from Brazil, was joined with the [[Tropic<U+00E1>lia]] responsible for the diffusion on bigger scale by the electrification of the pop music, with a universal, but Brazilian proposal. Some musicians from this group are: [[Milton Nascimento]], [[L<U+00F4> Borges]], [[Toninho Horta]], [[Beto Guedes]], [[Novelli]], [[Nelson <U+00C2>ngelo]], [[Tavinho Moura]] and the band [[Som Imagin<U+00E1>rio]].

==70's and the end of the prejudice==
The 70's started with the [[Progressive rock]], the [[Hard rock]] and [[Glam rock]], but is the period of the construction of the mutual interference between brazilian pop music, "[[M<U+00FA>sica Popular Brasileira]]", and the rock.

[[Rita Lee]] (ex-[[Mutantes]]) started her own work with her band Tutti Frutti like a Brazilian [[Glam rock]] aesthetic. See also [[Casa das M<U+00E1>quinas]] with its music between Glam-hard-rock and Progressive, [[Patrulha do Espa<U+00E7>o]] between Progressive and Hard rock, [[Made in Brazil (band)]] with its Hard rock (but in some songs already with the minimal characteristic of Punk rock), the pure Hard rock of [[Bixo de S<U+00EA>da]], and [[Edy Star]], with his pure Glam rock. 

There were many [[Progressive rock]] bands in Brazil, such as [[O Ter<U+00E7>o]], [[A Bolha]] (Hard rock with Progressive mix), [[M<U+00F3>dulo 1000]], [[A Barca do Sol]], [[Som Nosso de Cada Dia]], [[V<U+00ED>mana]] and [[Bacamarte]], which were very well-known in Europe and the US by progressive fans. The Progressive rock band [[Som Imagin<U+00E1>rio]] had an experimental characteristic: [[Jazz]], [[Bossa nova]], [[Contemporary music]], [[Impressionist music]] with the traditional Folk and [[Baroque]] from [[Minas Gerais]] State resulting in a kind of a Brazilian [[Art rock]] version, and with renowned musicians: [[Wagner Tiso]], [[Z<U+00E9> Rodrix]], [[Tavito]], [[Luiz Alves]], [[Frederyko]] (Fredera). 

The "carioca" (from Rio de Janeiro city) [[Azimuth (band)]], was formed in 1969 and is the [[Jazz rock]] side of this generation, but is responsible of the Brazilian pop music development too. There are great musicians that can add up here: [[Airto Moreira]], [[Flora Purim]], [[Hermeto Paschoal]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Geraissati]], [[Egberto Gismonti]], [[Grupo D'Alma]] and [[S<U+00E9>rgio Mendes]] (with [[Funk]] influence too). 

Other bands and musicians of the period mixed rock with Brazilian pop music: [[Secos & Molhados]] (identified as glam rock too), [[Raul Seixas]], [[Novos Baianos]], [[A Cor do Som]], [[Robertinho do Recife]] and an union of [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Maria Beth<U+00E2>nia]] and [[Gilberto Gil]] in the show named [[Doces B<U+00E1>rbaros]].  After the end of Secos & Molhados [[Jo<U+00E3>o Ricardo (musician)]] continued his career and his first album was all glam,  [[Ney Matogrosso]] was a pop hit and [[G<U+00E9>rson Conrad]] was constructing an alternative career. Other musicians - that helped to turn the traditional Brazilian music more flexible, with powerful rock or pop influences - were a relative hit too, like [[Alceu Valen<U+00E7>a]], [[Geraldo Azevedo]], [[Belchior]], [[Gonzaguinha]], [[Z<U+00E9> Ramalho]], [[Raimundo Fagner]], [[Luiz Melodia]], [[Boca Livre]] and after the end of [[Novos Baianos]], [[Baby Consuelo]] (then [[Baby do Brasil]]), [[Pepeu Gomes]] and [[Moraes Moreira]], but there were musicians that made a more experimental mix, who didn't have the same good luck in their careers and access to the media, and because of this are known as "malditos", the darns, but at a later time they will be an important reference for the second Brazilian alternative scene - they are: [[Ednardo]], [[Walter Franco]], [[Jorge Mautner]], [[Jards Macal<U+00E9>]],  [[Taiguara]], [[Arnaldo Baptista]] ([[Mutantes]]) and [[S<U+00E9>rgio Sampaio]]. [[Marku Ribas]] is the side more [[Black music]] of this group and was [[Bob Marley]]'s friend in the 1970s, [[Jamaica]], where he lived. On the other hand, [[Tim Maia]], directly influenced by [[Soul music]] side of the [[Jovem Guarda]], made several hits. 

From that time a genre named [[Rock Rural]] had in the [[Brazilian folk music]] and the rock its influence and some expressive artists are [[Z<U+00E9> Rodrix]], [[S<U+00E1> & Guarabira]], [[Ruy Maurity Trio]], [[Alm<U+00F4>ndegas]] and others... A more radical Brazilian folk (that can get muddled with the rock), a weighty influence in the brazilian rock then, is found in [[D<U+00E9>rcio Marques]], [[Elomar]], [[Xangai]], [[S<U+00E9>rgio Reis]], the singer [[Diana Pequeno]], and afterward, already in the beginning of the 1980s, [[Almir Sater]] and [[Renato Teixeira]]. Even more radical is [[Marlui Miranda]], an expert in the [[Brazilian indian music]] and despite her music isn't rock in the classic form, the creative folk music that she makes is a great contribution to the alternative aesthetic, at a later time.

There were some efforts to realize festivals in Brazil in the 1970s. In 1971 the "Festival de  Ver<U+00E3>o de Guarapari" (Guarapari Summer Festival), a beach city in the [[Esp<U+00ED>rito Santo]] State, tried to be a great [[counterculture]] meeting but with mistakes in the organization of the event - however is historic, with the shows of [[Milton Nascimento]] and [[Som Imagin<U+00E1>rio]], [[A Bolha]], [[Novos Baianos]], [[Luiz Gonzaga]] and [[Tony Tornado]]. A fresh attempt was the "Primeiro Festival de Iacanga"  (First Iacanga Festival - S<U+00E3>o Paulo State - 1975), in a big farm, with a better structure, a milestone of the Brazilian undeground, with the bands: [[Jazzco]], [[Apokalypsis (band)]], [[Som Nosso de Cada Dia]], [[Moto Perp<U+00E9>tuo]], [[Ursa Maior (band)]], [[Rock da Mortalha]], [[Orquestra Azul]], and others. The first [[Hollywood Rock]] happened in Rio, 1975 too, with the shows of [[Raul Seixas]], [[Rita Lee]], [[O Ter<U+00E7>o]], [[V<U+00ED>mana]] and others. There were two great international shows in Brazil in the 1970s: [[Alice Cooper]] (1974) and [[Genesis]] (1977).

The [[Disco music]], that arrived in Brazil in the half of the 1970s, influenced some rockers like [[Rita Lee]] and [[Z<U+00E9> Rodrix]]. [[As Fen<U+00E9>ticas]] (women band) were an instant phenomenon with its mix of brazilian rock and disco.

In the final 70's the progressive influence still was felt in [[Guilherme Arantes]] and [[14 Bis (Band)]].

==Punk rock==

The [[Brazilian punk rock]] scene was born in the middle 70's in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]] with [[Joelho de Porco]], [[AI-5]], [[Condutores de Cad<U+00E1>veres]], [[Restos do Nada]], [[Aborto El<U+00E9>trico]]. The first show was in 1978 in S<U+00E3>o Paulo and the punk "boom" was when the 80's began, with [[Inocentes]], [[C<U+00F3>lera]], [[Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o]], [[Garotos Podres]], [[Plebe Rude]], [[Ignoze]], [[Olho S<U+00EA>co]], [[Mercen<U+00E1>rias]] (an all women band), [[Lobotomia]], [[M-19 (Band)]], [[Fogo Cruzado]], a representavive of the State of Rio de Janeiro, [[Rio de Janeiro]] city, [[Coquetel Molotov (band)]], a representative of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, [[Porto Alegre]] city, [[Os Replicantes]], a representative of the State of Pernambuco, [[Recife]] city, [[Devotos]] (or [[Devotos do <U+00D3>dio]]), a representative of the [[Curitiba]] city, State of Paran<U+00E1>, [[Beijo AA For<U+00E7>a]], and many others, most from [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] city.

The first records from the end of 1970's to the 1980s were issued by dint of the demo-tapes because Brazil was living a dictatorial regime (until 1985) and there was the rebuke. Since the beginning, the Brazilian punk music style was more for [[Jello Biafra]] than [[Sex Pistols]], that is, it was more for [[Hardcore punk]]. An independent label was created in the beginning of the 1980s, [[Punk Rock Discos]], and the [[Lixomania]] single was the first record of an individual band of a Brazilian punk band, in 1982, with six songs; from the same independent label, in the same year, a first Brazilian LP of punk bands appeared, [[Grito Suburbano]] album, with three bands from S<U+00E3>o Paulo city: C<U+00F3>lera, Olho S<U+00EA>co and Inocentes. Some of these first registers are rarities and well paid by the collectors in Europe and Japan. The Brazilian punk rock gained visibility in the international media also in 1982 with "[[O Come<U+00E7>o do Fim do Mundo]]", a festival that gathered peacefully the rival gangs for the first time, and it is one of the biggest punk festivals of the world until today.  Tokyo, the [[Supla]]'s band, in 1985 released its first LP in one big label, and then, Inocentes and Replicantes recorded with a big label too, in 1986, when the Brazilian punk scene was already growing colder. In 1986 C<U+00F3>lera was the first Brazilian punk band to make international shows, and then, Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o. In the 90's the punk returned to the scene. Some examples of bands: [[Flicts]], [[Zumbis do Espa<U+00E7>o]], [[Ludovic (band)]], [[Mukeka di Rato]], [[Blind Pigs]] (today [[Porcos Cegos]]), [[Carbona (band)]], [[A<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Direta (band)]], [[Ack (brazilian band)]], [[Gritando HC]], [[Nitrominds]], [[Tequila Baby]], [[Dominatrix (feminist band)]], [[Motores]].

[[Wander Wildner]], that passed by one of the more influential [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Punk rock]] bands, [[Os Replicantes]], released his solo debut in 1996 with a creative punk fusion that he named "Punk-brega".

The early Brazilian punk scene was immortalized on the documentary "Botinada: A Origem do Punk no Brasil" directed by Gast<U+00E3>o Moreira.

==BRock - the 1980s boom==
Even though the 1960s witnessed the phenomenon of [[Jovem Guarda]] and the 1970s saw the appearance of many prolific artists, like [[Raul Seixas]], and bands like [[Os Mutantes]], Brazilian rock's explosion began in 1981 with the first expressions of the [[Brazilian New Wave]], later renamed ''the New Jovem Guarda'' by the media. The Punk rock already was incorporated but the [[Ska]] was the news. The alterations of the [[English New Wave movement]], with its surprising variety of styles, arrived in [[Brazil]] through groups and personalities such as the [[Gang 90]], [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Camisa de V<U+00EA>nus]], [[Bar<U+00E3>o Vermelho]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], [[Ritchie (musician)]], [[Kid Vinil]], [[Fausto Fawcett]], [[Lulu Santos]], [[Radio Taxi]], [[Sempre Livre]], [[Magazine (brazilian band)]], [[Marina Lima]], [[Dr. Silvana & Cia.]], [[Jo<U+00E3>o Penca]], [[Absyntho]], [[Eduardo Dusek]], [[Kiko Zambianchi]],  [[Han<U+00F3>i Han<U+00F3>i]], [[Hojerizah]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[RPM (Brazilian band)|RPM]], [[Metr<U+00F4> (band)]], [[Uns e Outros]], [[Grafitti (band)]], [[Ultraje a Rigor]], [[Legi<U+00E3>o Urbana]], [[Ira!]], [[Tit<U+00E3>s]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Nenhum de N<U+00F3>s]], [[Biquini Cavad<U+00E3>o]], [[Lob<U+00E3>o]] & [[Os Ronaldos]], [[Her<U+00F3>is da Resist<U+00EA>ncia]], [[L<U+00E9>o Jaime]], [[Neusinha Brizola]], and [[Jo<U+00E3>o Penca]] & [[Miquinhos Amestrados]]<ref>Behague, Gerard. "Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985-95)." Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79-90.</ref>. The [[Rock in Rio]] took over a million people to "Cidade do Rock" (where the event was held) during the ten days of the event, and established Brazil as a venue for international artists - some artists, like [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], had come before this event, but the number of international attractions rose abruptly after [[Rock In Rio]]. 

The underground scene had - Post-punk with Jazz, Funk, Folk, Rap, Reggae, Dodecaphonic and Atonal experience - experimental bands and musicians  such as [[Arrigo Barnab<U+00E9>]], [[Itamar Assump<U+00E7><U+00E3>o]], [[Robson Borba]], [[Zero (brazilian band)]], [[Violeta de Outono]], [[Grupo Rumo]], [[Tet<U+00EA> Esp<U+00ED>ndola]], [[Eliete Negreiros]], [[Patife Band]], [[Fellini (band)]], [[Akira S & as Garotas que Erraram]], [[Vzyadoc Moe]], [[Volunt<U+00E1>rios da P<U+00E1>tria]], [[Gueto (band)]], [[Os Mulheres Negras]] - this group was identified as S<U+00E3>o Paulo Vanguard or "Vanguarda Paulistana", from the beginning of the 1980s - and on the other hand had [[Hard rock]], [[Punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal]] bands such as [[Golpe de Estado]], [[Viper (band)|Viper]], [[Korsus]], [[Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o]],  [[Mammoth (Band)]] and [[Karisma]] from [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo State]], [[De Falla (band)]] (pioneer in the funk-rock mix too) from [[Rio Grande do Sul]] State, [[Sepultura]] from [[Minas Gerais]] State and [[Dorsal Atl<U+00E2>ntica]], [[Rio de Janeiro State]], from the mid to late 1980s - this last,  the pioneer in the unification of this three styles of hard music. But the one of the first bands of [[extreme metal]] from Brazil is the "mineira" (from [[Minas Gerais]]) [[Sarc<U+00F3>fago]] that arose in 1985.

This movement is seen as a reflection of the worldview of urban youth who had grown up under a dictatorial regime and faced such processes as industrial expansion, and family deterioration. This is the same generation that enjoyed the democratic ''abertura'' (opening) and began to absorb rather quickly an infinite amount of new information, previously inaccessible. The universe of that generation appeared rich in diversity, implying a desire to enjoy the present.<ref>Behague, Gerard.

In the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s another group that mixes electronic music scene up appeared - in [[Santos (S<U+00E3>o Paulo)]], [[Campinas]], [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] cities - Electronic post-punk, Industrial, EBM, Technopop, and the similar genres - and some bands and artists are well-known in Europe: [[Loop B]], [[Harry (band)]], [[Sicilian Unit]], [[Individual Industry]], [[Biopsy (band)]], [[Simbolo]], [[City Limits (band)]], [[Inhumanoids (band)]], [[Morgue (band)]], [[Suba (musician)|Suba]],  etc... .

Two musicians and singer songwriters, [[Renato Russo]] from [[Legi<U+00E3>o Urbana]] and [[Cazuza]] from [[Bar<U+00E3>o Vermelho]], begun a brilliant solo career from the 1980s to the 1990s, but were [[HIV]] fatal victims.

==Contemporary==

In modern times, the 1990s saw a resurgence in instrumental rock's popularity, and some of the classic bands from previous decades reformed.  [[Surf music]] also became popular, especially [[The Argonauts]], [[The Gasolines]] and [[Os Ostras]]. The Hard rock had in 1993 a new representative in Brazil, [[Dr. Sin]], and the Heavy metal had two debuts: in 1990 [[Torture Squad]] and in 1991 [[Angra (band)]] - all from [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]]. But none of these styles could keep up with the new bands who were a large success, like [[Raimundos]] (which was formed in the late 1980s, but only released its first album in 1994) with its [[Forrocore]] style, [[Skank (band)|Skank]] and [[O Rappa]] with a kind of reggae-rock, [[Pato Fu]] the first band with the new alternative characteristic to arrive in the mainstream, and [[Charlie Brown Jr.]] in later years with its rock added to the rap. The band [[Mamonas Assassinas]] was a great hit with humour and rock and the its members died in an tragic plane accident (1996). Also [[Jota Quest]] met with the success in the firt album, 1996, and arrived with a pop-rock-funk and made several hits. 

From the end of the 1980s to beginning of the 1990s names like [[Velhas Virgens]], [[Killing Chainsaw]], [[Pelvs]], [[Cascavelletes]], [[Graforr<U+00E9>ia Xilarm<U+00F4>nica]], [[TNT (brazilian band)]], [[Virna Lisi (band)]], [[Planet Hemp]], [[Dead Fish]], [[Garage Fuzz]], [[Mechanics (band)]], [[Cascadura]], [[Pin Ups (band)]], [[Boi Mam<U+00E3>o]], [[brincando de deus]], [[Little Quail and The Mad Birds]], [[Walverdes]], [[Maria Ang<U+00E9>lica]], [[Tianast<U+00E1>cia]], [[Pen<U+00E9>lope]], [[Second Come]], [[Dash (band)]], [[Lacertae]], [[Snooze (band)]], [[J<U+00FA>piter Ma<U+00E7><U+00E3>]] and [[Karnak (band)]] are proeminent. This moment can be called the first Brazilian independent or alternative scene.  It was the [[Grunge]] and [[Britpop]] times, the Hardcore development, distortion colors and the return to Punk. The independent festival [[Junta Tribo]] in [[Campinas]] city in 1993 and 1994 and [[M2000]], a great beach festival in [[Santos (S<U+00E3>o Paulo)]], in 1994, were a milestone and turned the alternative attitude a new option. 

The [[MTV Brasil]] [[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]] format brought back bands whose career were considered over, like the Tit<U+00E3>s in 1996, Capital Inicial in 2000 and, more recently, Ira! in 2004 and Lob<U+00E3>o in 2007.

In the beginning of 90's there was the [[Manguebeat]] (or [[Mangue Bit]]) movement that put Recife city definitively as one of principal places that has an important modern rock scene. Its style is a cross between the local rhythms, like [[Maracat<U+00FA>]], and Rock, [[Hip hop]] and Electronic music . From this movement are [[Chico Science & Na<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Zumbi]] (with the death of Chico Science the name passed to be [[Na<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Zumbi]]), [[Mundo Livre S/A]], [[Fred 04]], [[DJ Dolores]], [[Stella Campos]], [[Otto (musician)]] etc...

[[Kurt Cobain]] after his shows in Brazil with [[Nirvana (band)]] in 1993 helped spread the Brazilian rock in the world.

Between final 90's and beginning of the current century are relevant [[Los Hermanos]] that is a noteworthy reference to the independent bands, [[C<U+00E1>ssia Eller]] a woman that recorded several songs of the Brazilian rock musicians and suddenly died in 2001, [[Pitty]] that has a good woman bandleader and vocal, and [[Lob<U+00E3>o]] (that in the 80's was mainstream) started his independent career and is obtaining a brilliant result, and the singer of [[Sepultura]], [[Max Cavalera]], left the band and started [[Soulfly]] with the same powerful [[Heavy metal]]. 

The important hardcore scene from [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]] continued in this period with [[Raimundos]] and [[Rumbora]]. In the highlight of the [[Raimundos]], [[Rodolfo Abrantes]], the vocal, decided to go out and assembled a new band, [[Rodox]], in 2002, but they continued with the typical creative explosion of hardcore into the end of the band, in 2004.

[[Melodic hardcore]] is currently one of the most popular rock genres of the country: bands like [[CPM 22]], [[ForFun]], [[Fresno (band)|Fresno]], [[Detonautas]] and [[Hateen]] often hit high spots on the hit parade, thanks mostly to heavy airplay on Brazilian [[MTV]].Ultimately in Brazilian rock scene the bands that most gained attention were [[NX Zero]] and [[Strike (brazilian band)]].

The boundary between the [[MPB]] - "[[M<U+00FA>sica Popular Brasileira]]" - and the international pop and rock was largely broken in the 1990s with [[Chico C<U+00E9>sar]], [[Fernanda Abreu]], [[Paula Morelenbaum]], [[Lenine]] ([[Osvaldo Lenine Macedo Pimentel]]), [[Luiz Tatit]], [[Paulinho Moska]], [[Ed Motta]], [[Badi Assad]], [[Marisa Monte]], [[Carlinhos Brown]], [[Arnaldo Antunes]] (ex [[Tit<U+00E3>s]]), [[Nando Reis]] ([[Tit<U+00E3>s]]), [[Zeca Baleiro]], [[Lula Queiroga]], [[Jair Oliveira]], [[Wilson Simoninha]], [[Bebel Gilberto]], [[Pedro Mariano]] and [[Max de Castro]] and now in a more definitive form. By the 2000s is already very difficult to distinguish or to know what is Rock, what is MPB (brazilian pop music) or another genre, with the Brazilian alternative aesthetic of this generation. This new fusion is encountered too in [[Dante Ozzetti]], [[Vanessa da Mata]] (ex [[Black Uhuru]] backing vocal), [[C<U+00E9>U (singer)]], [[Curumin]], [[Orquestra Imperial]], [[Nina Becker]], [[Seu Jorge]], [[Romulo Fr<U+00F3>es]], [[Fernando Catatau]], [[Jonas S<U+00E1>]], [[Kristoff Silva]] and [[Mandr<U+00E1>gora]]. The [[Vanessa da Mata]] songs "Ai, Ai, Ai" and "Boa Sorte/Good Luck" (with [[Ben Harper]] collaboration) became number-one hits in Brazil. [[Jos<U+00E9> Miguel Wisnik]] is turning a reference in this new musical construction.

==Subgenres==

Some rock genres are very specific in Brazil, but with a important scene like Grindcore, Psycobilly, Death Metal, Ska Punk, etc. Some highlights are: [[Tihuana]], [[Madame Machado]] and [[Rusty Machine]] in Ska Punk, [[K<U+00E3>es Vadius]] in Psycobilly and [[Krisiun]] in Death Metal. There are several festivals about these genres.

== Underground ==

The Brazilian underground bands and musicians is a division: part is influenced by the Hard rock, Hardcore, Metal, part is influenced by the 90's [[alternative rock]], after [[Strokes]] boom, but there are too the influences of the 1970s [[Brazilian music]] and [[Glam rock]], of the [[Folk music]] (Brazilian or not), the 1980s B-rock and S<U+00E3>o Paulo Vanguard, the [[Jovem Guarda]] (the garage side of this genre), the [[Tropic<U+00E1>lia]], the [[Samba rock]] and the [[Black music]] revisited, [[Electro]], [[Rap]], [[Ska]], [[Jazz]], [[Dub music]] and part is influenced by almost all of this genres. A large number of bands were created. Among pioneers from this period are [[Cachorro Grande]], [[Tetine]] (London), [[Cansei de Ser Sexy]] (CSS) (London), [[Autoramas]], [[Cordel do Fogo Encantado]], [[Momboj<U+00F3>]], [[Cibelle]] (London), [[Wry]] (London), [[Forgotten Boys]], [[Gram (band)]], [[Ludov]], [[Cidad<U+00E3>o Instigado]], [[Canto dos Malditos na Terra do Nunca]], [[Bid<U+00EA> ou Balde]], [[MQN]], [[Sapo Banjo]], [[Vulgue Tolstoi]], [[Lampir<U+00F4>nicos]], [[Leela (band)]],  [[Relesp<U+00FA>blica]], [[Doiseu Mimdoisema]], [[Fernando Chu<U+00ED>]], [[Pedro Lu<U+00ED>s e a Parede]],  [[Hurtmold]] (instrumental), [[Sleepwalker (band)]], [[Zumbi do Mato]], [[Astromato]], [[Thee Butcher's Orquestra]], [[Grenade (band)]], [[Wado (band)]], [[The Charts (brazilian band)]], [[Astronautas (brazilian band)]], [[M<U+00F3>dulo]]. 

In the beginning of the XXI Century, the Brazilian rock is leaving the second independent scene and has a lot of opportunities with the festivals (like [[Bananada]], [[Por<U+00E3>o do Rock]], [[Camping Rock]], [[Humaita Pra Peixe]], [[Grito Rock]], [[Fora do Eixo]], [[Abril Pr<U+00F3> Rock]], [[Goi<U+00E2>nia Noise]], [[Mada (festival)]], [[Calango (festival)]], [[Festival Garimpo]], [[Varadouro]], [[Rec-Beat]], [[Jambolada]]) and [[Independent record label|independent]] labels (like [[Monstro Discos]], [[Senhor F]], [[Mondo 77]], [[Trama Records]], [[Travolta Discos]], [[Deckdisc]], [[Fora do Eixo Discos]], [[Esc<U+00E1>rnio e Osso]]).

The rock is mixed with the all genres of Brazilian music and the alternative scene is continuing the experimental and creative characteristic of the rock-fusion from Brazil, an universal and contemporary concept of music.
