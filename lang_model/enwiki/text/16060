'''Ullenhall''' is a [[village]] and [[civil parish]] in the [[Stratford-on-Avon (district)|Stratford district]] of [[Warwickshire]], [[England]], situated about {{convert|2|mi|km}} West of [[Henley in Arden]] and {{convert|11.2|mi|km}} West of the [[county town]] of [[Warwick]]. The name means Ulla's nook, the [[Old English]] word hahl, meaning a nook or corner of land, suggesting the hollow in which the village is situated, being comounded with a personal name of Scandinavian origin. <ref>Place Names in the Landscape, Margaret Gelling, 1984 ISBN 0 460 04380 3</ref> 

==History==

The manor is recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] where it is listed as ''Holehale'', one of the lands of [[Robert de Stafford]]. "In Ferncombe [[Hundred (country subdivision)|Hundred]] in Holehale (Ullenhall) 1 [[Hide (unit)|hide]]. Land for 15 ploughs. 17 villagers and 11 smallholders with 6 ploughs. Woodland <U+00BD> league long and 1 furlong wide. The value was and is <U+00A3>3 Waga held it."<ref>''Domesday Book'' for Warwickshire, Phillimore edited by John Morris ISBN 0 85033 141 2</ref> Waga, whose name is preserved in the near by village of [[Wootton Wawen]], was one of the witness's to [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Earl Leofric's]], husband of [[Lady Godiva]], foundation of the monastery at Coventry during the first year of the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] (1042/3). His lands extended beyond those at Ullenhall, but, following the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]], Ullenhall was bestowed by the conqueror on Robert de Stafford, descended from the de Tonei family and who had fought stoutly with [[William the Conquerer|Duke William]] against [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]]. He made [[Stafford]] his principal seat, where he had a strong castle and assumed his surname from thence.<ref>William Dugdale, the Antiquities of Warwickshire,1656</ref> 

Ullenhall stands on lands that were originally part of the [[Barrells Hall]] estate. The earliest mention of Barrells was a reference to a Richard Barel in 1405. In 1554 the estate was purchased by Robert Knight of [[Beoley]], 4 miles west of Ullenhall, and remained in the Knight family until 1856.  An inventory taken in 1652 shows that it was then an ordinary farmhouse, and a member of the Knight family appeared in the 1682 Heralds' Visitation of Warwick. The future 1st Earl, [[Robert Knight, 1st Earl of Catherlough|Robert Knight]], Lord Luxborough, purchased Barrells from a cousin in 1730. When Henrietta St John was banished to Barrells in 1736 it was still a relatively simple house, in very poor condition. When his son married  in 1750 he commissioned the Italian architect [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder]] to build an imposing extension, which thereafter became the main house.<ref>"Drawn to Entice" by Peter Meadows. Country Life Magazine 28 April 1988</ref> On Henrietta<U+2019>s death in 1756 her husband rebuilt large parts of it.
His wife Henrietta, Lady Luxborough, made the house the hub of a literary circle after her husband banished her to Barrells following a romantic indiscretion. Lady Luxborough,  was one of the first to establish a ''[[ferme orn<U+00E9>e]]'' and is credited with the invention of the word <U+201C>[[shrubbery]]<U+201D>. She was a prominent member of  "The Warwickshire Coterie",<ref name="Brown2006">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jane|title=My darling Heriott: Henrietta Luxborough, poetic gardener and irrepressible exile|year=2006|publisher=HarperPress|location=London|isbn=0-00-712994-7}}</ref> a group of poet friends including the poet [[William Shenstone]],<ref>Friendship with Shenstone stated on National Portrait gallery biog. of Lady Luxborough</ref> who had developed his own ''ferme orn<U+00E9>e'' at [[The Leasowes]] in [[Halesowen]], Shropshire 

The family crest was a winged spur which gives its name to the village pub to this day. The Newtons owned the house after the Knights and extended it dramatically. However, the house was very seriously damaged by fire in 1933 and lay derelict until 2005 when it was restored as a family home.

Despite its ancient roots, Ullenhall was not established as a separate Ecclesiastical Parish until June 1861 when the old manors of Apsley, Forde Hall and Mockley were also included in the parish.

==Notable buildings==
[[File:Ullenhall Old Chapel (9).JPG|right|thumb|The Old Chapel, Ullenhall, Warwickshire]]

The village has two churches. Situated on a hill to the north of the village is the old parish church of St Marys which is locally referred to as the Chapel. The oldest part of the building has been dated back to the 13th century but only the chancel of the original building now remains, to which a western porch has been added. There remain some ancient stained glass in the windows and some encaustic tiles in the floor.<ref name="Hobart Bird">Old Warwickshire Churches, W Hobart Bird 1936</ref> The font, of the 15th century, has an octagonal bowl with a moulded lower edge, and a plain stem. In the bowl one of the two staples remains.<ref name="Victoria County History"/> The memorials are to the Knights of Barrells Hall and a coloured memorial to Sir Francis Throkmorton who died in 1554<ref name="Hobart Bird"/>

The roof and bell tower were still under restoration at the turn of the 2000 millennium but at a service attended by 80 parishoners on the morning of 1 January 2000 the old bell was made to "ring in" the 21st Century by throwing Golf balls into the bell tower.<ref>Recorded in a history of the chapel displayed inside</ref> The balls were recovered some years later when the restoration was completed. 

The modern church of St Mary is down in the village and was constructed in 1875 by the three Newton brothers of Barrells Hall and  [[Glencripesdale Estate]] in memory of their parents William & Mary Newton.

A significant local landmark is The Crowley Oak which can be located just outside the village heading towards the A435. It has ancient oak status according to the Woodland Trust and with a girth of over seven metres, it certainly makes an impressive sight at the roadside.<ref>Woodland Trust website [http://www.ancient-tree-hunt.org.uk/discoveries/newdiscoveries/2008/crowleyoak.htm]</ref>

==Sports and leisure==

The Winged Spur public house stands in the centre of the village.
