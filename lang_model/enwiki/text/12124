"'''Your Body'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Christina Aguilera]] from her seventh studio album, ''[[Lotus (Christina Aguilera album)|Lotus]]'' (2012). It was written by [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Max Martin]], [[Shellback (producer)|Shellback]] and Tiffany Amber, while its production was done by Martin and Shellback. [[RCA Records]] premiered the song on September 14, 2012 on ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'', and later sent it to US [[contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] and [[rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] radio stations two days later as the [[lead single]] from ''Lotus''. "Your Body" is a [[dance music|dance]], [[synthpop|electropop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] number with elements from [[dubstep]] and [[Eurodance]]. Its lyrics see Aguilera expressing her desire of having sex with an anonymous partner.

Critical response to "Your Body" was mixed to positive: some of them praised Aguilera's vocals while the others criticized its lyrical theme and the synthesizers used in the track. The single achieved moderate success on charts; in the United States, it peaked at number 34 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with first-week sales of 103,000 copies, as well as topping the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]]. Internationally, the song peaked at number 10 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] and charted within the top forty charts of several countries, including Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

An accompanying music video for "Your Body" was released on September 28, 2012. Directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]] and shot in [[Los Angeles, California]], the video portrays Aguilera as a woman who kills men after seducing them. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who described it as one of Aguilera's best music videos. On November 2, 2012, Aguilera performed "Your Body" on the ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[The Roots]].

In December 2011, it was announced that Aguilera was teaming up with Swedish hit producer [[Max Martin]] on her comeback single for her then upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Cospey|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a356836/christina-aguilera-new-single-produced-by-max-martin.html|title=Christina Aguilera new single produced by Max Martin?|date=December 20, 2011|publisher=[[Digital Spy]].
