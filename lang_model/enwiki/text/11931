'''Han Sai Por''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+97E9><U+5C11><U+8299>|p=H<U+00E1>n Sh<U+00E0>of<U+00FA>}};<ref>{{citation|title=NAFA icons: Cultural Medallion|url=http://www.nafa.edu.sg/in_aboutus/nafa/nafaicons_cm.htm|publisher=[[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]]|year=2007|accessdate=13 June 2009}}.</ref> born 19 July 1943) is a [[Singapore]]an [[sculpture|sculptor]]. A graduate of the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] (NAFA), East Ham College of Art, Wolverhampton College of Art (now part of the [[University of Wolverhampton]]) and [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]], she worked as a teacher and later as a part-time lecturer at NAFA, the [[LASALLE College of the Arts|LASALLE-SIA College of the Arts]], and the [[National Institute of Education]], [[Nanyang Technological University]], before becoming a full-time artist in 1997.

Han has participated in exhibitions locally and abroad, including events in China, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Korea. Her first [[solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]], entitled ''Four Dimensions'', was held at the [[National Museum of Singapore|National Museum Art Gallery]] in 1993. Her sculptures can be found around the world, in [[Osaka]] and [[Shodoshima]], [[Kagawa Prefecture]], in Japan; [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Sarawak]] in Malaysia; and [[Washington, D.C.]] In Singapore, sculptures commissioned from her can be seen at [[Capital Tower, Singapore|Capital Tower]], the Defence Science Organisation National Laboratories, the [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade <U+2013> Theatres on the Bay]], the [[National Museum of Singapore]], [[Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore|Revenue House]], [[Singapore Changi Airport#Terminal 3|Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 3]], [[Suntec City Mall]], and [[Woodlands Regional Library]]. In 2001, Han was the founding President of the Sculpture Society (Singapore) and remains its Honorary President. She was the first [[artist in residence]] at the Society's Sculpture Pavilion at Fort Canning Park in 2009, where she worked on sculptures made from the trunks of [[tembusu]] trees.

Han is probably best known for her stone sculptures with organic forms, examples of which include ''Growth'' (1985), ''Spirit of Nature'' (1988), ''Object C'' (1992) and ''Seeds'' (2006). The last work, presently located in the grounds of the National Museum, consists of two large [[seed|kernels]] carved from [[sandstone]] excavated from [[Fort Canning|Fort Canning Hill]] during the Museum's redevelopment. However, her [[wikt:oeuvre#Noun|oeuvre]] is broad, and includes ''Four Dimensions'' (1993), a collection of geometrical structures; and ''20 Tonnes'' (2002), also installed at the Museum, which consists of a row of six ridged [[monolith]]ic granite blocks with a smaller block at either end, all hewn from a single rock.

For her contributions to art, Han was conferred the [[Cultural Medallion|Cultural Medallion for Art]] in 1995. She was also the winner of the sculpture and painting section at the 11th Triennale <U+2013> India organized by the [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] (National Academy of Art of India) in 2005, and the Outstanding City Sculpture Award in China the following year.

==Early life and education==
Han Sai Por was born on 19 July 1943 in Singapore during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]]. One of six children of a poor couple, the family were [[squatting|squatters]] living in [[Changi]] in a house made of cardboard boxes and coconut leaves. Nonetheless, Han had a happy childhood, and went to a nearby beach to make figurines of animals out of sand. This experience helped her to appreciate nature and instilled in her a sense of adventure and exploration. At ten years of age, Han was introduced to [[Michelangelo]]'s sculptures through a book given to her by her mother.<ref name="ST 19950901">{{citation|author=Ida Bachtiar|title=Never say die <U+2013> childhood poverty made life richer|newspaper=The Straits Times (Life!)|date=1 September 1995|pages=1<U+2013>2}}.</ref><ref name=Infopedia>{{citation|author=Nureza Ahmad|title=Han Sai Por|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_467_2004-12-23.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hWMByxwC|archivedate=14 June 2009|publisher=Singapore Infopedia, [[National Library Board]]|date=2 August 2004|accessdate=12 June 2009}}.</ref>

Having saved some money, she went to the United Kingdom where she studied [[fine art]] at the East Ham College of Art (1979<U+2013>1980) and the Wolverhampton College of Art (1980<U+2013>1983),<ref>The Wolverhampton College of Art merged with the Staffordshire and Wolverhampton Technical College in 1969 to form The Polytechnic, Wolverhampton, and in 1992 the institution became the [[University of Wolverhampton]]: {{citation|author=Sally Alt|title=University of Wolverhampton|url=http://www.hoovers.com/university-of-wolverhampton/--ID__135501--/free-co-profile.xhtml|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hWMIzgVq|archivedate=14 June 2009|publisher=[[Hoover's]]|accessdate=12 June 2009}}.</ref> receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. (Hons.)]] in Fine Art from the latter institution.<ref name="ST 19950901"/> She worked as a cook, hotel maid and waitress to support herself.<ref name=Infopedia/>

Han is probably best known for her stone sculptures with organic forms; she sees her sculpture has having "a force or inner life inside struggling to get out".<ref>{{citation|author=Han Sai Por|title=Four Dimensions: A Sculptural Installation|location=Singapore|publisher=Sheen's Gallery|year=1993|page=6|isbn=9789810043926}}.</ref> T.K.

The cost of just the material for solo exhibition pieces can cost up to [[Singapore dollar|S$]]20,000.

However, Han's [[wikt:oeuvre#Noun|oeuvre]] should not be underestimated. ''Four Dimensions'' (1993) was made up of ten geometrical structures, including single objects (such as ''Tetrahedron<U+2013>Tetrahedron Interpenetration'')<ref>See {{citation|title=Featured artwork of the month: Han Sai Por: ''Four Dimensions'': Tetrahedron<U+2013>Tetrahedron Interpenetration|url=http://www.sculpturesociety.org.sg/HansaiporGallery.html|publisher=Sculpture Society (Singapore)|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hWNNMzb8|archivedate=14 June 2009|month=October|year=2005|page=1|accessdate=13 June 2009}}.</ref> and opened-up [[plane (geometry)|planes]] (''Cubic Triangle'')<ref>See {{citation|title=Featured artwork of the month: Han Sai Por: ''Four Dimensions'': Cubic Triangle|url=http://www.sculpturesociety.org.sg/HansaiporGallery2.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hWNRtRoB|archivedate=14 June 2009|publisher=Sculpture Society (Singapore)|month=October|year=2005|page=3|accessdate=13 June 2009}}.</ref> connected with each other through the use of angles, and light and shadow. Han said: "My works are based on the concept of mathematical logic. The idea is to show how each step is based on the previous one so that the geometrical forms progress in logical sequence ... The fourth dimension is abstract. It cannot be seen or touched. It contains the feelings and talents of Mankind. We wish to possess this space and to open it up for all people to share."<ref>Han, ''Four Dimensions'', p. 11: see {{citation|author=Tan Yen Peng|title=Featured artist of the month: Han Sai Por|url=http://www.sculpturesociety.org.sg/Hansaipor2.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hWNWdkYr|archivedate=14 June 2009|publisher=Sculpture Society (Singapore)|date=October 2005|page=3|accessdate=13 June 2009}}.</ref> ''20 Tonnes'', first exhibited in 2002 in the atrium of the [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts|MICA Building]] (formerly the [[Old Hill Street Police Station]]) and now permanently installed in front of the National Museum, consists of a row of six ridged [[monolith]]ic granite blocks with a smaller block at either end, all hewn from a single rock. Han called the work "an explanation of nature's physical reaction when it is impacted by force, gravity and energy",<ref>{{citation|last=Han|first=Sai Por|title=Sculpture|location=Singapore|publisher=Art-2 Gallery|year=2002|page=11|oclc=225985814}}: see Tan, "Han Sai Por", p. 3.</ref> and commented: "When I am working on stone, the immediate context is physical, the force of hammering, chiseling and drilling hard stone creates heat and energy. The reaction of the particles causes sparks and waves of sound. The appearance of the stone is the result, the consequent physical reaction. Understanding the character of nature through the physical context has become part of my sculpture."<ref>Han, ''Sculpture'': see {{citation|author=Tan Yen Peng|title=Featured artist of the month: Han Sai Por|url=http://www.sculpturesociety.org.sg/Hansaipor3.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hWNb9DBQ|archivedate=14 June 2009|publisher=Sculpture Society (Singapore)|date=October 2005|page=4|accessdate=13 June 2009}}.</ref> 

In the [[exhibition catalogue|catalogue]] accompanying her ''Four Dimensions'' exhibition, Han expressed the following view: "[[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]] accepts the facts that art does not follow any rigid man-made rules. If the artist says, 'this is art' then it is art, provided only that the artist can demonstrate a valuable idea or concept. Art needs man to judge and decide whether it is indeed art."<ref>Han, ''Four Dimensions'', p. 11: see Tan, "Han Sai Por", p. 1.</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Han was awarded a scholarship for the Portland Sculpture Park on the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[Dorset]], England, by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and the NAC in 1990.
