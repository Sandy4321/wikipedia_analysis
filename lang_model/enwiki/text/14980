<!-- '''Russian Project Number:'''1124 -->

The ''Albatros'' class ('''Russian:''' ''<U+0410><U+043B><U+044C><U+0431><U+0430><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441>''; [[NATO reporting name]]: '''Grisha''') was a series of large [[anti-submarine]] [[corvette]]s built by the [[Soviet Union]] between 1970 and 1990.  These ships had a limited range and were used only in coastal waters. They were equipped with a variety of ASW weapons and an [[SA-N-4]] [[surface-to-air missile]] launcher. All were fitted with retractable fin stabilizers. Russian type designation was ''Malyy Protivolodochnyy Korabl'' (Small Anti-Submarine Ship).

Two were transferred to the [[Ukrainian Navy]] and around seven are in service with the [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Russian Maritime Border Guard]].

* The Grisha III class (1124M) were built in the late 1970s to early 1980s. These ships incorporated several small scale modifications, including a 30&nbsp;mm gun and new electronics. Thirty four units were built. About 20 remain in Russian service. Two ships were in service with the [[Lithuanian Navy]] till 2009. 

* A single Grisha IV class (1124K) ship was built. This ship was a trials ship for the SA-N-9 missile system and has been decommissioned.

* The Grisha V class (1124 ME) ships were built between 1985 and 1994. This incorporated further modifications with the twin 57&nbsp;mm guns being replaced by a single 76&nbsp;mm gun. Thirty ships were built. About 28 ships remain in the Russian Navy. [[Ternopil (U209)]] entered service in 2006 with the [[Ukrainian Navy]].
