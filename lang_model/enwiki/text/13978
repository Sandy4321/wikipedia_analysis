The '''Broadhurst Theatre''' is a [[Legitimate theater|legitimate]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] located at 235 West 44th Street in midtown [[Manhattan]].

It was designed by architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]],  a well-known theatre designer who had been working directly with the [[Shubert brothers]]; the Broadhurst opened 27 September 1917. Built back-to-back with the [[Plymouth Theatre|Plymouth]], it was meant to resemble the style of the neighboring  [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert]] and [[Booth Theatre|Booth]] theaters designed by Henry B. Herts, using less expensive brick and [[Architectural terracotta|terra cotta]] materials on the discreetly neoclassical facades. Like all of Krapp's work during this period, it features minimal ornamentation, a single balcony, wide space, and excellent sightlines. 

It was named after [[George Howells Broadhurst]], an [[English-American|Anglo-American]] [[dramatist]] who came to [[United States|America]] in 1886. In addition to writing plays, he managed theaters in [[Milwaukee]], [[Baltimore]], and [[San Francisco]] before he decided to open his own in association with the Shubert brothers. The theatre was constructed to house both musicals and plays, which it has done successfully for nearly ninety years. It has been designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]].

The Broadhurst opened on September 27, 1917 with [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Misalliance]]'', the first New York production of the philosophical 1910 comedy. It ran for only 52 performances and was not performed on Broadway again until 1953.

Recent tenants include ''[[Les Mis<U+00E9>rables (musical)|Les Mis<U+00E9>rables]]'', which in October 2006 began an intended six-month-long return engagement that finally closed in January 2008; and 2008 revivals of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', with an all-[[African American]] cast including [[Terrence Howard]], [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[James Earl Jones]], and [[Phylicia Rash<U+0101>d]], and ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', starring [[Daniel Radcliffe]] and [[Richard Griffiths]].
