The '''Okeechobee hurricane''', or '''San Felipe Segundo hurricane''', was a deadly [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that struck the [[Leeward Islands]], Puerto Rico, the [[Bahamas]], and Florida in September of the [[1928 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It was the second recorded hurricane to reach Category&nbsp;5 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] in the [[Atlantic basin]] after the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]]; as of 2010, it remained the only recorded hurricane to strike Puerto Rico at Category&nbsp;5 strength, and one of the ten most intense ever recorded to make landfall in the United States.

The hurricane caused devastation throughout its path. As many as 1,200&nbsp;people were killed in [[Guadeloupe]]. The storm directly struck Puerto Rico at peak strength, killing at least 300 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. In south Florida at least 2,500 were killed when a storm surge from [[Lake Okeechobee]] breached the dike surrounding the lake, flooding an area covering hundreds of square miles.<ref name="Gibson">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/4/2006_4_26.shtml Christine Gibson] "Our 10 Greatest Natural Disasters," ''American Heritage'', Aug./Sept. 2006.</ref> In total, the hurricane killed at least 4,078&nbsp;people and caused around US${{Formatprice|100000000}} (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1928|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) in damages over the course of its path.

The storm was first observed 900&nbsp;miles (1450&nbsp;km) to the east of Guadeloupe on September 10 by the ''S.S. Commack''. At the time, this was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio.<ref name="mwr-westindian">{{cite journal|author=Charles L.

As the storm neared the [[Caribbean]], it was already a Category 3 hurricane.<ref name="HURDAT"/> On September 12 it passed over Guadeloupe and then south of the other Leeward Islands; Guadeloupe reported a pressure of 27.76&nbsp;[[inHg]] (940&nbsp;[[mbar]]), and a ship just south of [[St. Croix]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]] reported it as an even stronger storm with a pressure of 27.50&nbsp;inHg (931&nbsp;mbar).<ref name="mwr-westindian"/> On the 13th the storm struck Puerto Rico directly as a Category 5 hurricane, allegedly packing winds of 160&nbsp;mph (260 km/h);<ref name="HURDAT"/> reliable reports from [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] placed the wind speed at 125&nbsp;[[knot (speed)|knots]] (145&nbsp;mph, 230&nbsp;km/h), and a report from [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]] placed the pressure at 27.65&nbsp;inHg (936&nbsp;mbar).<ref name="mwr-westindian"/> The 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) wind measurement from Puerto Rico was taken by a cup [[anemometer]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], 30&nbsp;miles (50&nbsp;km) north of the storm's center, which measured 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds three hours before the peak wind speed was reached; however, the instrument was destroyed soon after and could not be calibrated. This unverified reading was the strongest wind measurement ever reported for an [[Atlantic hurricane]] up until that time; not until [[Hurricane Dog (1950)|Hurricane Dog]] of 1950 were stronger winds officially measured in an Atlantic storm, although some unmeasured storms like the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935|1935 Labor Day Hurricane]] may have been stronger.<ref name="HURDAT"/> Because of this measurement, the Okeechobee storm was the first hurricane, in the Atlantic basin known to have reached Category&nbsp;5 intensity, although in 2009, it was found that the 1924 Cuba Hurricane had reached Category 5 as well; although it is virtually certain that earlier hurricanes had achieved this strength (a likely candidate is the [[Great Havana Hurricane of 1846]]), none had ever had their winds or pressure recorded properly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The hurricane was also extremely large as it crossed Puerto Rico. Hurricane-force winds were measured in [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]] for 18&nbsp;hours; since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the diameter of the storm's hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234&nbsp;miles (376&nbsp;km).<ref name="mwr-pr">{{cite journal|author=Oliver L.

The hurricane moved directly over the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean, strengthening as it did so. On the island of [[Dominica]] winds were clocked at 24&nbsp;mph (39&nbsp;km/h); there were no reports of damages.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/> In [[Martinique]], even further south of the storm's path, there were three fatalities.<ref name="pastdeadly"/> Guadeloupe received a near-direct hit from the storm, apparently with little warning; the death toll there was 600<U+2013>1200,<ref name="pastdeadly"/> and damage reports relayed through Paris indicated "great destruction" on the island.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/>

[[Montserrat]], just north of the storm's center, was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered <U+00A3>150,000 (1928 [[GBP|UKP]]) in damages and 42 deaths; [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] and [[Salem, Montserrat|Salem]] were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive.<ref name="Montserrat"/> The storm passed to the south of the islands of [[St. Kitts]] and [[St. Croix]], which suffered heavy damages to property and crops but no reported fatalities.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/> [[Nevis]] did report three deaths due to the storm, though.<ref name="Hubbard"/> Damage reports from elsewhere in the Leeward Islands are not available.

=== Puerto Rico ===
[[File:Hurricane winds drive a 10-foot 2X4 through a palm tree.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Hurricane-force winds drove this 10-ft (3 m) [[Dimensional lumber|2x4]] through a palm tree in Puerto Rico]]
The island of Puerto Rico received the worst of the storm's winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at Category 5 strength. The island knew of the storm's approach well ahead of time; by about 36&nbsp;hours in advance all police districts were warned and radio broadcasts provided constant warnings to ships. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker [[1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco]] killed approximately 3,000&nbsp;people.<ref name="mwr-pr"/>

The storm was named the ''San Felipe II Hurricane'' because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the [[Christian]] [[feast day]] of Saint Philip.<ref name=Mujica>{{Cite conference | first = Frank | last = M<U+00FA>jica-Baker | title = Huracanes y Tormentas que han afectado a Puerto Rico | publisher = Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, Agencia Estatal para el manejo de Emergencias y Administraci<U+00F3>n de Desastres | url = http://www.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/49EA64D0-305B-4881-8B85-04B518004BD5/0/Ciclones_en_PR.pdf | pages = 10 | accessdate = august 30, 2010}}</ref> It was named "Segundo", Spanish for "the Second", because of another destructive "[[San Felipe Hurricane|Hurricane San Felipe]]" which struck Puerto Rico on that same day in 1876.<ref>{{Cite conference | first = Frank | last = M<U+00FA>jica-Baker | title = Huracanes y Tormentas que han afectado a Puerto Rico | publisher = Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, Agencia Estatal para el manejo de Emergencias y Administraci<U+00F3>n de Desastres | url = http://www.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/49EA64D0-305B-4881-8B85-04B518004BD5/0/Ciclones_en_PR.pdf | pages = 9 | accessdate = august 30, 2010}}</ref> Since European arrival in the Americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name of the saint of the day the storm hit Puerto Rico.<ref name=Nombre>{{Cite conference | first = Frank | last = M<U+00FA>jica-Baker | title = Huracanes y Tormentas que han afectado a Puerto Rico | publisher = Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, Agencia Estatal para el manejo de Emergencias y Administraci<U+00F3>n de Desastres | url = http://www.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/49EA64D0-305B-4881-8B85-04B518004BD5/0/Ciclones_en_PR.pdf | pages = 4 | accessdate = august 30, 2010}}</ref> In 1953 that the United States started naming hurricanes by female names until 1978 when both gender names began to be used.<ref name=Nombre/> Yet it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after Saints.<ref name=Nombre/>

San Felipe II is classified officially in Puerto Rico as the biggest, worst, and most devastating hurricane to ever have impacted the island.<ref name=Mujica/> Even though it was the worst hurricane to hit the island, others such as the [[1899 San Ciriaco hurricane|San Ciriaco Hurricane]] caused more deaths. The first warning the Island received was by the steamship Commack on latitude 17<U+00B0> north and longitude 48<U+00B0> West. San Felipe entered the island early in the morning of Thursday September 13, with its eye close to [[Guayama]] and it traversed the island in a north-west direction, leaving between the towns of [[Aguadilla]] and [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]]. The eye of the hurricane made its Puerto Rico crossing in eight hours, moving at about {{convert|13|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. In Guayama, located in south eastern Puerto Rico, the lowest recording of the storm was taken; {{convert|27.5|in|mm}} at 2:30 p.m.<ref name=Mujica/>

====Rainfall====
The rain on the 13 and 14 of September 1928, are the record holders for the maximum of rainfall associated with a hurricane in Puerto Rico in a period of forty-eight hours.<ref name=Mujica/> In those regions where precipitation is more common place, as in Adjuntas in the [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]] and in the Sierra de Luquillo, the rain was over {{convert|25|in|mm}}, with {{convert|29.60|in|mm}} recorded in Adjuntas.<ref name=Mujica/>

====Wind====
The anemometer located in [[Puerta de Tierra, Puerto Rico|Puerta de Tierra]] lost one of its cups at 11:44 a.m. on the 13th of September, just when it had registered a maximum speed of {{convert|150|mi|km}} per hour, a speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes. Previously the same instrument had measured {{convert|160|mi|km}} per hour for one minute.<ref name=Mujica/> The city of San Juan was {{convert|30|mi|km}} away form the eye of San Felipe when those measurements were recorded. Because of which it seams probable that some estimates of {{convert|200|mi|km}} per hour in the center of the storm might not seem so far fetched.<ref name=Mujica/>

====Damages====
There was general destruction through the island, with the towns where the eye passed being swept away.<ref name=Mujica/> Property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic. The northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of Category&nbsp;3 strength, with hurricane-force winds lasting as long as 18&nbsp;hours. Official reports stated "several hundred thousand" people were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at $50&nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000000|1928|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD)).<ref name="mwr-pr"/><ref name="history">{{cite web|author=U.S. Southern Command|title=Hurricane Preparedness: History|publisher=U.S. Army|accessdate=2008-01-14|url=http://www.southcom.mil/usag-miami/sites/hurricane/hurricane_history.asp|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217202517/http%3A//www.southcom.mil/usag-miami/sites/hurricane/hurricane_history.asp |archivedate = December 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In the island there was no building that was not affected.<ref name=Mujica/> Some sugar mills ("Centrales") that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble. Reports say that 24,728 homes were completely destroyed and 192,444 were partially destroyed.<ref name=Mujica/>  Most of the [[sugarcane]] fields were flooded, thus losing the year's crops. Half of the [[Coffee (plant)|coffee plants]] and half of the [[shade tree]]s that covered these were destroyed; almost all of the coffee harvest was lost. The coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow. The [[tobacco]] farms also had great losses. After this hurricane, Puerto Rico never regained its position as a [[Caf<U+00E9> Rico|coffee exporter]].<ref>[http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/revista/articles/view/901 Stuart B. Schwartz.

Communications were impacted by fallen trees, landslides, and debilitated bridges. Of the school buildings 770 were destroyed or debilitated. According to some estimates of the day, excluding personal losses, the damages reached (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|85312000|1928|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD)) and over 500,000 people were left homeless.<ref name=Mujica/>

=== Bahamas ===
{{deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|align=left}}
The eye of the hurricane passed just south of [[Grand Bahama]] as a strong Category 4 hurricane, again causing very heavy damage. According to a firsthand account from the island, it was the worst storm in memory to strike the area. As in Puerto Rico, however, authorities in the Bahamas were aware of the hurricane's passage well ahead of time, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands. The only report of fatalities was from a [[sloop]] lost at sea in the vicinity of [[Ambergris Cay, Bahamas|Ambergris Cay]] with 18 on board.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/>

=== South Florida ===
Coastal damage in Florida near the point of landfall was catastrophic. [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], well south of the point of landfall, escaped with very little damage; [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]] and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] suffered only slight damages. In Fort Lauderdale, numerous power lines and telephone wires were downed.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Storm Hits City Sunday|year=1928|publisher=Fort Lauderdale Daily News|accessdate=2008-06-27|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/nationworld/search/sfl-9.17.1928hurricane1,0,4406073.story}}</ref> Northward, from [[Pompano Beach, Florida|Pompano Beach]] to [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]], buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10&nbsp;ft (3&nbsp;m) storm surge, which was heaviest in the vicinity of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]; total coastal damages were estimated as "several million" dollars.<ref name="mwr-westindian">{{cite journal

[[Image:1928 Okeechobee Aftermath 17.jpg|thumb|left|Aftermath of the hurricane in southern Florida]]
Inland, the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of Lake Okeechobee. Residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day, but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule, many thought it had missed and returned to their homes. When the worst of the storm crossed the lake<U+2014>with winds measured on the ground at around 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h)<U+2014>the south-blowing wind caused a [[storm surge]] to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake. The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20&nbsp;ft (6&nbsp;m) deep. Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered.<ref name="sptimes">{{

As the rear [[eyewall]] passed over the area, the flood reversed itself, breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing a similar but smaller flood.
[[Image:1928 Okeechobee Flood.png|thumb|right|Approximate area of the flood. Note: The Palm Beach County label is misplaced. North of Canal Point has been in Martin County since 1925.]]
Floodwaters persisted for several weeks, greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation.  Burial services were quickly overwhelmed, and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves.  Around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers, making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this, the count of the dead is not very accurate.  The [[Red Cross]] estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836, which was taken as the official count by the [[National Weather Service]] for many years (and exactly equal to the official count for [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Older sources usually list 3,411 as the hurricane's total count of fatalities, including the Caribbean. However, in 2003 the U.S. death count was revised as "at least" 2,500, making the Okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in United States history behind the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]]. A mass grave at the Port Mayaca Cemetery east of [[Port Mayaca, Florida|Port Mayaca]] contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricane.<ref name="Brochu">{{cite web|author=Brochu, Nicole Sterghos|year=2003|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/nationworld/search/sfl-ahurricane14sep14,0,6237828.story|title=Florida's Forgotten Storm: the Hurricane of 1928|publisher=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>

Thousands of people were left homeless in Florida; property damage was estimated at $25&nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|25000000|1928|r=2}}}}). It is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2003, it would cause $18.7&nbsp;billion in damages. The cyclone remains one of three Atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of Florida with a central pressure below 940&nbsp;mbar (27.76&nbsp;inHg), the others being the [[1926 Miami hurricane]] and [[Hurricane Andrew]] of [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season|1992]].<ref name="USHurricanes">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2008|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/ushurrlist18512007.txt|title=All U.S. Hurricanes (1851-2007)|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>

=== Elsewhere ===
Limited damage reports are available for the United States outside of southern Florida. The storm caused flooding in [[North Carolina]] and brought near-hurricane-force winds and a 7&nbsp;foot (2.1&nbsp;m) storm surge to the [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] area.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Roth and Hugh Cobb|title=Virginia Hurricane History|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2008-01-14|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/vaerly20hur.htm}}</ref> Nonetheless, most sources agree that the hurricane caused only minimal damage in these areas.<ref name="mwr-westindian"/>

== Aftermath ==
{{Deadliest United States hurricanes|align=left}}
=== Racial issues ===
In Florida, although the hurricane destroyed everything in its path with impartiality, the death toll was by far highest in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around Lake Okeechobee. Around 75% of the fatalities were from migrant farm workers, most of whom were black. Black workers did most of the cleanup, and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites; other bodies were either burned or buried in mass graves. Burials were segregated, and the only mass gravesite to receive a memorial contained only white bodies.<ref>{{

=== Improved building codes ===
In the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming on the heels of the 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Betty Nelander|title=The Hurricane of 1928: Category 4 hurricane scarred Palm Beach|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-27|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/content/specialsections/HURRICANE1928page.html}}{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

To prevent a recurrence of disasters like this one and the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926, the Florida State Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District, which was authorized to cooperate with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in flood control undertakings.<ref name="USArmyCorps">{{cite web|url=http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/sfoo/index.html|title=Lake Okeechobee and The Okeechobee Waterway|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers South Florida Operations Office|accessdate=2008-08-03|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609125358/http%3A//www.saj.usace.army.mil/sfoo/index.html |archivedate = June 9, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> After a personal inspection of the area by President [[Herbert Hoover]], the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations.<ref name="USArmyCorps" /> One of the solutions was the construction of the [[Herbert Hoover Dike]]. Today, concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with "piping" and [[erosion]]. Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events. Proposed solutions to the dike's problems have included the construction of a [[soil mechanics|seepage]] [[berm]] on the landward side of the dike, with the first stage costing approximately $67&nbsp;million ([[United States dollar|USD]]).<ref name="USArmyCorps2">{{cite web|url=http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/cco/docs/hhd/LakeOandHHDike.pdf|title=Lake Okeechobee and the Herbert Hoover Dike|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Jacksonville District|accessdate=2008-08-03|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>
