"'''Langit Makin Mendung'''" ("'''The Sky is Increasingly Cloudy'''") is a controversial Indonesian short story. Published in ''Sastra'' magazine under the pen name Kipandjikusmin in August 1968, it tells the story of [[Muhammad]] descending to Earth with the angel [[Gabriel]] to investigate the decreasing number of Muslims entering [[jannah|heaven]], only to find that Muslims in Indonesia have begun [[fornicating]], drinking alcohol, waging war on Muslims, and otherwise gone against the tenets of Islam, poisoned by the [[Sukarno]] government's ideology combining nationalism, religion, and communism, or [[nasakom]]. Unable to do anything to stop the rampant sinning, Muhammad and Gabriel watch the political maneuvering, crime, and famine in [[Jakarta]] in the form of eagles.

Upon its publication, "Langit Makin Mendung" drew heavy criticism for its depictions of [[Allah]], Muhammad, and Gabriel, leading to it being banned in [[North Sumatra]] and ''Sastra''{{'s}} offices in Jakarta being attacked. Despite published apologies from the writer and publisher, the head editor of ''Sastra'', [[HB Jassin]], was tried for blasphemy; he was later convicted to a one-year [[suspended sentence]]. Critical views of the story vary; the story has been compared to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' for its depiction of a man on a spiritual quest with a spiritual companion, yet criticized for depicting Allah, Muhammad, and Gabriel in a negative light. The legal case itself has been subject to debate, with both sides arguing [[freedom of expression]] and the scope of imagination.

== Background ==
Indonesia is the world's largest majority-Muslim country. This has had a large influence on the development of Indonesia, both in its [[Indonesian National Revolution|national revolution]] and in modern times.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=v}} However, it has been used to justify and promote political positions. The [[Netherlands East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] minimized the role of the religious leaders, the ''[[kyai]]'' and ''[[ulama]]'', in an attempt to prevent them using their influence to lead resistance. Modern rulers have used it to "maintain the status quo", while those pushing for change use Islam as a means for justice or other political ends. This has led to a general fragmentation.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=v<U+2013>vii}}

During the early 1960s then-President [[Sukarno]] declared a new state ideology of [[Nasakom]], which stood for ''Nasionalisme, Agama, dan Komunisme'' (Nationalism, Religion, and Communism), which would complement the existing policy of ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]''. This declaration, viewed as proof of increasing [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (''Partai Komunis Indonesia'', or PKI) power,{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=808}} led to conflict between the PKI and the [[Tentara Nasional Indonesia|military]].{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=86}} In the midst of an escalating [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|confrontation with Malaysia]] (1963<U+2013>1966), Sukarno demoted General [[Abdul Haris Nasution]], Commander of the Army, and promoted [[Ahmad Yani]], while the PKI spread rumours that a CIA-sponsored board of generals (''Dewan Jenderal'') were plotting against the government, using the [[Gilchrist Document]] as proof.{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=86}} Eventually, [[30 September Movement|a coup]] on 30 September 1965, thought to have been sponsored by the PKI, killed six generals,{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=879}} leading to the [[Indonesian killings of 1965<U+2013>1966|massacre of suspected communists]] and the [[Transition to the New Order|fall of Sukarno's government]] over the next two years.{{sfn|Cribb|2002|p=550}}

== Plot ==
[[Muhammad]] and the other [[prophets of Islam]], bored of living in ''[[jannah]]'' (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of [[Allah]], request permission to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad to explain why he wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims were coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that they had been poisoned by [[Sukarno]]'s policy of [[Nasakom]] and grants permission.

After much fanfare, Muhammad departs ''jannah''{{'s}} airport, riding a ''[[buraq]]'', or winged horse. The Archangel [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Gabriel]] accompanies him. On the way, they encounter a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing that they are [[kafir|infidels]], Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the ''buraq'' and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass [[Jakarta]], which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of [[Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia's 90 million Muslims]] are true believers, as well as the fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.

Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an epidemic of the flu is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the [[30 September Movement]] in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers have a large party with ''[[haraam]]'' events, including the consumption of pork and frog and ''[[zina]]'' (sex outside of marriage).

Muhammad and Gabriel, having transformed into eagles to observe Jakarta, see prostitution, adultery, theft, and drinking. Muhammad is shocked that ''zina'' and theft continue unabated, calling for Gabriel to help him [[Rajm|stone]] the adulterers and cut the hands off the thieves. Gabriel replies that there are not enough stones for the adulterers, and the swords have been replaced by guns bought by the "infidel" Soviets and Americans who "worship dollars". They later see a minister, referred to only as [[Togog]], attempting to use the [[Gilchrist Document]] to overthrow Sukarno. Muhammad gives up on Indonesia, planning to install television in ''jannah''.

Eventually, Sukarno recovers from the poison and is told about the Gilchrist Document, also being told that the Chinese are reneging on their agreement to supply nuclear weapons for Indonesia's confrontation with Malaysia. Sukarno uses the Gilchrist Document to spread rumours and distrust among the populace, demoting his commander of the military, while the Chinese ambassador is sent home.

== Writing and influences ==
"Langit Makin Mendung" was written under the pen name Kipandjikusmin. [[HB Jassin]], head editor of ''Sastra'', said that Kipandjikusmin had been born to a Muslim family but educated in a Catholic junior school prior to being sent to a naval academy; Jassin noted that this Catholic education, with [[Christian literature|literature]] which personifies God and angels, may have influenced his writing style. Another influence was Javanese ''[[wayang]]'', or shadow puppets, with stories which traditionally have a hierarchy of anthropomorphic deities.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=31<U+2013>33}} Jassin also notes influences from the culture of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy]] era, evidenced from terms like [[sputnik]] and the social commentary, with strong condemnation of [[prostitution in Indonesia]] and Sukarno's Nasakom.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=41}}

Kipandjikusmin later wrote to ''Ekspres'' magazine that his goal in writing the short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed.{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=86}} He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he had often thought of the [[Heaven (Christianity)#Roman Catholicism|Catholic heaven]] as being similar to the Javanese ''Kahyangan'', with God being similar to [[Batara Guru]]. His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] as the [[Lamb of God]].{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=31<U+2013>33}} It was originally meant to be a serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began.{{sfn|Rampan|2000|p=257}}

== Style ==
"Langit Makin Mendung" has been described as being written with crude and offensive expressions. Jassin argues that the style, though direct and at times discourteous, indicates a sense of irony, humor, sarcasm, and cynicism.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=41}}

== Release and reception ==
"Langit Makin Mendung" was published in the literary magazine ''Sastra'', headed by [[HB Jassin]], in August 1968, under the pen name Kipandjikusmin.{{efn|name=pen name}}{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=vii}} It became instantly controversial, with Indonesian Muslims considering it blasphemous and an [[Islam and blasphemy|insult to Islam]]. Among the points of contention were the anthropomorphic personification of Allah, as well as the "less than respectful" treatment of Muhammad and other Islamic figures. It was banned in [[North Sumatra]] on 12 October{{sfn|Rampan|2000|p=256}} and groups of young Muslims attacked ''Sastra''{{'s}} headquarters in Jakarta.{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=85}} After threats of prosecution, Jassin and his co-editor Rachman issued a public apology; despite this, the magazine was banned.{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=86}} On 22 or 25 October 1968, Kipandjikusmin followed suit, with a statement submitted to ''[[Kami (newspaper)|Kami]]''.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=33}}

In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's office in [[Medan]] filed charges against Jassin, charging him with blasphemy{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=35}}{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=86}} after he was unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name.{{sfn|''The Jakarta Post'', 2000-03-12, "Memory of Jassin"}} At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story was a product of the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam;{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=39}} he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the [[Quran]] and [[Sufi]] literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer [[Hamka|Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah]] (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the [[Crusades]].{{sfn|Mujiburrahman|2006|p=215}} Jassin was sentenced to a one year [[suspended sentence]].{{sfn|Deakin|1976|p=86}}

== Polemics ==

=== Literary ===
Jassin writes that "Langit Makin Mendung", as a result of its author's imagination, is not dogma, history, ethics, or an objective reality, but a work within its own world. As a result, Allah, Muhammad, and other religious figures are [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] and not representative of their counterparts. He further argues that "Langit Makin Mendung" is not written as an insult, but [[social criticism]] on perceived mistakes and corruption during the Sukarno period. He draws on parallels between "Langit Makin Mendung", [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', and [[Allama Muhammad Iqbal]]'s ''[[Javid Nama]]'', focusing on the journey of a person and a guide,{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=39<U+2013>41}} with objections being raised due to readers identifying imagination with religion.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=45}}

Another critic, Bahrum Rangkuti, wrote that "Langit Makin Mendung" had to be judged based on Kipandjikusmin's intentions, which he interpreted as ridding Islam of Nasakom, which he saw as not being compatible. He noted that the Muslims criticized in the story are those who act in ways that are not permitted in Islam, such as drinking and committing ''zina'', while other targets include inept leadership and corruption. Like Jassin, Rangkuti notes numerous instances of Allah being personified in the Quran and [[hadith]]s; he views the personification of Allah in "Langit Makin Mendung" as an attempt to draw Muslims closer to Allah.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=42<U+2013>43}}

Sukarsono argues that "Langit Makin Mendung" would have been a "monumental" critique, with a good description of degeneration and immorality in the early 1960s, if written during Sukarno's regime, like [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' was for its time, but as it was released in the New Order it lost some of its impact. He notes that in most cases the personification of Allah as being compatible with Islamic views of Allah. However, Allah's donning of gold spectacles is seen as being in contradiction to the tenets of Islam.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|p=47}}

An opposing view, offered by Indonesian literary critic M. Jusuf Lubis, is that "Langit Makin Mendung", as it is based on actual events and dogma, including Muhammad's [[Isra and Mi'raj|night journey]]. He rejects the view that the controversy arose from a misunderstanding of the story, writing that Indonesian Muslims reacted because they will not accept works that they see as denying the existence of Allah or comparing ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'' to Nasakom. He notes that Jassin is inconsistent in his defense, calling the representations of Allah, Muhammad, and Gabriel figments of the author's imagination, but citing Sukarno and Nasakom as influences.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=46<U+2013>47}}

=== Legal ===
[[File:Taufiq Ismail crop.jpg|thumb|alt=Taufiq Ismail in a black [[peci]]|Taufiq Ismail supported ''Sastra'', not "Langit Makin Mendung"]]
Many studies have been made pertaining to the legal aspects of the "Langit Makin Mendung" case. One opinion is that the prosecution office had no legal basis for acting as both judge and literary critic in the case, with the blasphemy laws used in prosecution not being at least government or parliamentary level. The banning of ''Sastra'' is criticized for having no legal basis, as laws pertaining to the banning of print media at the time only applied to foreign publications; per the then-applicable Press Laws, any banning of a magazine would require approval of the Press Board. The need for [[freedom of speech]] is also mentioned.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=35<U+2013>36}}

Another view is that the prosecution's actions were justified, pointing to the obscurity of the press laws, as well as the intent to publish, indicated by the story's prominent placement in the magazine. In response to arguments that the banning of ''Sastra'' was a violation of the right to freedom of speech, Sju'bah Asa argues that the public and prosecutors have the same right, which can exercised through protests or legal action. Poet [[Taufiq Ismail]] notes that most protests against the prosecution's actions were for their motion to ban ''Sastra'', a reputable and respected publication, which does not indicate that "Langit Makin Mendung" was being supported.{{sfn|Tahqiq|1995|pp=36<U+2013>37}}
