'''''Ekaterina II''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0415><U+043A><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> II}} ''[[Catherine II of Russia]]'') was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass|Ekaterina II|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the [[1880s]]. Her crew was considered unreliable when the crew of the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} mutinied in June 1905<ref group=Note>All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]</ref> and her engines were decoupled from the [[propeller]]s to prevent her from joining ''Potemkin''. She was turned over to the [[Sevastopol]] port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907. She was redesignated as ''Stricken Vessel Nr. 3'' on 22 April 1912 before being sunk as a torpedo target for the [[Black Sea Fleet]].

==Design==
[[File:Ekaterina II class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1896.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1896</center>]]
''Ekaterina II'' was {{convert|331|ft|8.5|in|m}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|339|ft|3|in|m}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|68|ft|11|in|m}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, {{convert|24|in|1}} more than designed. Her displacement was {{convert|11050|LT|t|0|lk=on}} at load, almost {{convert|900|LT|MT|abbr=on|0}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|10181|LT|t|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 21</ref>

''Ekaterina II'' had two three-cylinder [[Compound engine|vertical compound steam engines]] built by the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]]. Fourteen cylindrical [[Boiler (steam generator)|boilers]], also built by the Baltic Works, provided steam to the engines. The engines had a total designed output of {{convert|9000|ihp|0|lk=on}}, but they produced {{convert|9101|ihp|abbr=on}} on trials and gave a top speed of {{convert|15.25|knots}}. At full load she carried {{convert|900|LT|MT|0}} of coal that provided her a range of {{convert|2800|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}} and {{convert|1367|nmi}} at {{convert|14.5|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 21, 29<U+2013>30</ref>

''Ekaterina II'' differed from her [[sister ship|sisters]] mainly in her {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on|sp=us}} gun mounts. Her guns used bulky, hydraulically powered Moncrieff [[disappearing gun]] mounts. They had a rate of fire of five minutes, ten seconds between aimed rounds. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30<U+00B0> across the bow and 35<U+00B0> abaft the beam, or a total of 155<U+00B0>. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}}) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. The seven {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[6 inch 35 caliber naval gun 1877|Obukhov Model 1877]] 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures, except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. Six of the eight {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} five-barreled revolving [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were mounted in small [[sponson]]s that projected from the hull with the aftermost pair mounted in embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against [[torpedo boat]]s. Four {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]]. She carried seven above-water {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes were mounted on each [[broadside]] forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 26<U+2013>28</ref>

== History ==
''Ekaterina II'' was named after the Empress Catherine II of Russia. She was built by the [[Shipyard named after 61 Communards|Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard]] at [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]]. She was laid down on 26 June 1883, launched on 20 May 1886, and completed in 1889.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 21, 30</ref> She ran her first trials in 1888, after she had been transferred to Sevastopol to be fitted out, and spent her career with the [[Black Sea Fleet]].<ref>McLaughlin, p. 30</ref> In 1897 the Naval General Staff proposed to re-gun her with more powerful 12-inch 40-caliber guns and to replace the compound armor of her redoubt with [[Krupp armor]], but this proved to be too expensive. Her machinery was upgraded between mid-1898 and 1902. Her boilers were replaced with eighteen Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s and her engines were converted to triple expansion. On trials after the refit she made {{convert|9978|ihp|abbr=on}} and a speed of {{convert|15|knots}} on 8 November 1902.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 155, 157</ref> 

Her crew was considered sympathetic to the [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolutionary movement]] when the crew of the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} mutinied in June 1905 and her engines were disabled to prevent her from joining ''Potemkin''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bascomb|first=Neal|title=Red Mutiny: Eleven Fateful Days on the Battleship Potemkin|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|date=2007|page=154}}</ref> She was turned over to the [[Sevastopol]] port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907. She was redesignated as ''Stricken Vessel Nr. 3'' on 22 April 1912 before being sunk as a torpedo target.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 31</ref>
