{{Psalms}}
'''[[Psalm]] 83''' is the last of the [[Psalms of Asaph]], which include Psalms 50 and 73-83. It is also the last of the so-called "Elohist" collection, Psalms 42-83, in which the name of God [[Elohim]] is mainly used.<ref name="ECB">Dunn, James D. G. and John W. Rogerson. ''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible''. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003. ISBN 0-8028-3711-5.</ref> It is generally seen as a national lament provoked by the threat of an invasion of Israel by its neighbors. The psalm has been seen by some commentators as being purely cultic in nature. Others have indicated that the fact that particular nations are specifically named indicates that it does refer to a specific historical period, even though the prayer itself would be offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref name="PC">Black, Matthew, editor. ''Peake's Commentary on the Bible''. Camden, NJ:Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1962.</ref> The dating of the composition of the Psalm is debated, but the reference in verse 9 to [[Assyria]] is by many sources seen as an indication that the Psalm was written during the time of Assyrian ascendancy, the ninth to seventh centuries BC. <ref name="TNJBC">''The New Jerome Biblical Commentary''.

==Verse 1==
The specific meaning of this verse is disputed. The verb can be translated to refer to either speech ("be not silent") or motion ("be not inactive").<ref name="TNJBC"/> The fact that the verse requests the assistance of God three times emphasizes the urgency of the situation and of the people's prayer.<ref name="ECB"/>
==Verses 2 through 5==
In the text of the psalm, specifically verses 2 through 5, the speaker makes the assumption that individuals who plot against the nation of [[Israel]] must inherently be enemies of God.<ref name="TIBC">Farmer, William R., editor. ''The International Bible Commentary''. Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1998. ISBN 0-8146-2454-5.</ref>He also ascribes to them the intention of the complete extinction of the people of Israel, as that is the meaning of verse 4, which indicates that the name of Israel will be obliterated or remembered no more.<ref name="PC"/>

==Verses 6 through 8==
These verses provide the names of the ten nations which have evidently formed a coalition against Israel, the [[Edom]]ites, the [[Ishmaelites]], [[Moab]], the [[Hagrite]]s, [[Byblos|Gebal]], [[Ammon]], [[Amalek]], the [[Philistines]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], and [[Assyria]].<ref name="TNJBC"/>
==Verses 9 through 12==
The narrator goes on to assume that [[God]] himself will fight on Israel's side in the upcoming battle, based on the stories contained in the 4th through 8th chapters of the [[Book of Judges]], citing individual actions attributed to God in that book. <ref name="TIBC"/>.
==Verses 13 through 17==
In these verses, the narrator specifically requests that God make the opponents of Israel suffer and experience shame and die in disgrace for opposing Israel, and, by extension, God himself.<ref name="TIBC"/>The specifics mentioned, including chaff, fire and storm, are references to the [[Sirocco]].<ref name="TNJBC"/>

==Verse 18==
In this verse, the narrator states that he wishes God perform these various acts so that all might know that God is the most powerful entity and has sway over all the Earth.<ref name="TIBC"/> This verse, with verse 16, indicates that, although the bulk of the psalm is a prayer for the destruction of the enemies of Israel, there is some positive hope that the enemies of Israel might come to acknowledge the God of Israel. <ref name="PC"/>
While the [[King James Version]] usually translates the [[tetragrammaton]] as "LORD", this verse has one of the few occurrences in which it is translated as "JEHOVAH". Presumably for that reason this particular verse is widely quoted, particularly by members of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], as an alleged proof that "[[Jehovah]]" is the personal name of [[God]].<ref>{{cite web
