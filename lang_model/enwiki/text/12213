'''Plutonium''' ({{pronEng|plu<U+02D0><U+02C8>to<U+028A>ni<U+0259>m}}, symbol '''Pu''', [[atomic number]]<U+2014>or element<U+2014>94) is a rare [[transuranic]] [[radioactive]] [[chemical element|element]]. It is an [[actinide]] [[metal]] of silvery-white appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, forming a dull coating when [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidized]]. The element normally exhibits six [[allotrope]]s and four [[oxidation state]]s. It reacts with [[carbon]], [[halogen]]s, [[nitrogen]] and [[silicon]]. When exposed to moist air, it forms [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s that expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that can [[pyrophoricity|spontaneously ignite]]. It is also a [[Radiation poisoning|radioactive poison]] that accumulates in [[bone marrow]]. These and other properties make the handling of plutonium dangerous, although its overall toxicity is sometimes overstated.

The most important [[isotope]] of plutonium is [[plutonium-239]], with a [[half-life]] of 24,100&nbsp;years. Plutonium-239 is [[fissile]], meaning that the nuclei of its atoms can [[nuclear fission|break apart]] by being bombarded by [[neutron temperature|slow moving]] [[neutron]]s, releasing energy, [[gamma radiation]] and [[neutron radiation|more neutrons]]. It can therefore sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]] after reaching a [[critical mass]], leading to applications in [[nuclear weapon]]s and use in some [[nuclear reactor]]s. The most stable [[isotopes of plutonium|isotope of plutonium]] is [[plutonium-244]], with a half-life of about 80&nbsp;million years, long enough to be found in trace quantities in nature. [[Plutonium-238]] has a half-life of 88&nbsp;years and emits [[alpha particle]]s. It is a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which are used to power some [[spacecraft]]. [[Plutonium-240]] has a high rate of [[spontaneous fission]], raising the background neutron rate of any sample it is contained in. The presence of Pu-240 ends up limiting a sample's weapon and power potential and determining its grade: weapons (<&nbsp;7%), fuel (7<U+2013>19%) and reactor grade (>&nbsp;19%). Pu-238 and Pu-239 are synthesized by bombarding [[uranium-238]] with [[deuteron]]s and neutrons, respectively.   

Element 94 was first synthesized in 1940 by a team led by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] and [[Edwin McMillan]] at a [[University of California, Berkeley]] laboratory. McMillan named the new element after [[Pluto]] and Seaborg suggested the symbol Pu as a joke. Trace amounts of plutonium were subsequently discovered in nature. Discovery of plutonium became a classified part of the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop an atomic bomb during [[World War II]]. The first [[nuclear test]], "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]" (July 1945), and the second atomic bomb used to destroy a city ([[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan in August 1945]]), "[[Fat Man]]", both had cores of Pu-239. [[Human radiation experiments]] studying plutonium were conducted without [[informed consent]] and a number of [[criticality accident]]s, some lethal, occurred during and after the war. Disposal of [[nuclear waste|plutonium waste]] from [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear disarmament|dismantled nuclear weapons]] built during the [[Cold War]] is a major [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear-proliferation]], health and environmental concern. Other sources of [[plutonium in the environment]] are [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from numerous above-ground nuclear tests (now [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|banned]]) and several [[nuclear accident]]s.

[[Resistivity]] is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of [[electric current]].

The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the <U+03B1> form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to [[cast iron]] but changes to the plastic and malleable <U+03B2> form (''beta'') at slightly higher temperatures.<ref name = "Miner1968p542"/> The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The <U+03B1> form has a low-symmetry [[monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility and poor conductivity.<ref name = "Baker1983"/>

Plutonium in the <U+03B4> form (''delta'') normally exists in the 310&nbsp;<U+00B0>C to 452&nbsp;<U+00B0>C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of [[gallium]], [[aluminium]], or [[cerium]], enhancing workability and allowing it to be [[welding|welded]].<ref name = "Miner1968p542"/> The delta form has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium.<ref name = "Baker1983"/><!-- NEEDS CITE In fission weapons, the explosive [[shock wave]]s used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha form, significantly helping to achieve [[supercriticality]]. /NEEDS CITE -->

[[Image:Plutonium ring.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Weapons-grade electrorefined plutonium]]
Pu-239 has a [[Four factor formula|multiplication factor]] (k) larger than one, which means that if the metal is present in sufficient mass and with an appropriate geometry (e.g., a compressed sphere), it can form a [[critical mass]].<ref>

On August 18, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time.

The nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied; researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]]. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/>

=== Production during the Manhattan Project ===
During World War II the U.S. government established the [[Manhattan Project]], which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the [[Hanford Site]], the [[uranium enrichment]] facilities at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].<ref>

[[PUREX]] (''P''lutonium<U+2013>''UR''anium ''EX''traction) [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocesses]] [[spent nuclear fuel]] to extract uranium and plutonium to form a mixed oxide ([[MOX fuel|MOX]]) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in [[light water reactor]]s and consists of 60&nbsp;kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements).<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> [[Breeder reactor]]s are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.

MOX fuel has been in use since the 1980s and is widely used in Europe.<ref>

The isotope [[plutonium-238]] (Pu-238) has a half-life of 87.5&nbsp;years. It emits a large amount of [[thermal energy]] with low levels of both [[gamma]] rays/particles and [[spontaneous fission|spontaneous neutron]] rays/particles.<ref name="pumper">{{cite journal

A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by Pu-238 while one [[kilogram]] of the isotope can generate 22&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour]]s of heat energy.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 338}}<ref name="pumper"/>

These characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices which must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime. It is therefore used in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and [[radioisotope heater unit]]s such as those in the [[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Cassini]], [[Voyager program|Voyager]] and [[New Horizons]] space probes. Earlier versions of the same technology powered the [[ALSEP]] and [[EASEP]] systems including [[seismology|seismic]] experiments on the [[Apollo 14]] Moon mission.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/>

The [[alpha particle|alpha]] radiation plutonium emits does not penetrate the skin, but can irradiate internal organs when plutonium is inhaled or ingested.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> Particularly at risk is the [[skeleton]], where it is likely to be absorbed by the bone surface, and the [[liver]], where it collects and becomes concentrated.<ref name = "Miner1968p545"/>

Considerably larger amounts may cause acute [[radiation poisoning]] and death if ingested or inhaled; however, no human is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.<ref name = "world-nuclear"/>

=== Criticality potential ===
[[Image:Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg|thumb|A simulated sphere of plutonium surrounded by neutron-reflecting [[tungsten carbide]] blocks in a re-enactment of Harry Daghlian's 1945 experiment]]
Toxicity issues aside, care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]], particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/> A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and [[gamma ray]]s.<ref name = "Miner1968p546">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 546}}</ref> Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to [[Neutron moderator|moderation]] by the hydrogen in water.<ref name = "CRC2006p4-27"/>

[[Criticality accident]]s have occurred in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of [[tungsten carbide]] bricks around a 6.2&nbsp;kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on August 21, 1945, when scientist [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]] received a dose estimated to be 5.1&nbsp;[[Sievert]] (510&nbsp;[[Roentgen equivalent man|rems]]) and died 28&nbsp;days later.<ref>
