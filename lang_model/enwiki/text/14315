Papyrus is first known to have been used in [[ancient Egypt]] (at least as far back as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]), but it was also used throughout the [[History of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] region. Ancient Egyptians used this plant as a writing material and for boats, mattresses, mats, rope, sandals, and baskets. Chemically, papyrus is composed of 57% [[cellulose]], 27% [[lignin]], 9% minerals, and 7% water.<ref>William H.

== History ==
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' written on papyrus]]

Papyrus was first manufactured in Egypt as far back as the third millennium BC.<ref name = Skeat>H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. [http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html "Papyrus and its uses"] ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).</ref> In the first centuries BC and AD, papyrus [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]]s gained a rival as a writing surface in the form of [[parchment]], which was prepared from animal skins.<ref>[[Jaroslav <U+010C>ern<U+00FD> (Egyptologist)|<U+010C>ern<U+00FD>, Jaroslav]]. 1952. ''Paper and Books in Ancient Egypt: An Inaugural Lecture Delivered at University College London, 29 May 1947''. London: H. K. Lewis. (Reprinted Chicago: Ares Publishers Inc., 1977).</ref> Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which [[Codex|book-form codices]] were fashioned. [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] soon adopted the codex form, and in the Gr<U+00E6>co-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices.

Codices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll, as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking and a long roll, or scroll, was required to create large-volume texts. Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness. Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality, the writing surface was irregular, and the range of media that could be used was also limited. 

Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products [[parchment]] and [[vellum]], of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though [[Henri Pirenne]]'s connection of its disappearance with the Muslim overrunning of Egypt is contended.<ref>Pirenne, ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', critiqued by R.S. Lopez, "Mohammed and Charlemagne: a revision", ''Speculum'' (1943:14<U+2013>38.).</ref> Its last appearance in the [[Merovingian]] chancery is with a document of 692, though it was known in [[Gaul]] until the middle of the following century. The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus are 1057 for a papal decree (typically conservative, all papal "bulls" were on papyrus until 1022), under [[Pope Victor II]],<ref>[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 166.</ref> and 1087 for an Arabic document. Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive paper introduced by [[Arabs]]. By the 12th century, parchment and paper were in use in the [[Byzantine Empire]], but papyrus was still an option.<ref name=Byzantine>Bompaire, Jacques and Jean Irigoin. ''La paleographie grecque et byzantine'', Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1977, 389 n. 6, cited in Alice-Mary Talbot (ed.). ''Holy women of Byzantium'', Dumbarton Oaks, 1996, p. 227. ISBN 088402248.</ref>

Papyrus was made in several qualities and prices; these are listed, with minor differences, both by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Isidore of Seville]].

Until the middle of the 19th century, only some isolated documents written on papyrus were known. They did not contain literary works.<ref>[[Frederic G. Kenyon]], [http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924024493649#page/n11/mode/2up ''Palaeography of Greek papyri''] (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1899), p. 1.</ref> The first discovery of papyri rolls in modern days was made at [[Herculaneum]] in 1752.

== Etymology ==

The [[English language|English]] word 'papyrus' derives, via [[Latin]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] <U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C0><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2> (''papuros'').<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Fpuros <U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C0><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> Greek has a second word for it, <U+03B2><U+03CD><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2> (''bublos'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbu%2Fblos <U+03B2><U+03CD><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> said to derive from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Byblos]]). The Greek writer [[Theophrastus]], who flourished during the 4th century BC, uses ''papuros'' when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and ''bublos'' for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or  writing surfaces. The more specific term <U+03B2><U+03AF><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2> ''biblos'', which finds its way into English in such words as 'bibliography', 'bibliophile', and 'bible', refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant. ''Papyrus'' is also the etymon of 'paper', a similar substance.

Egyptians may have referred to papyrus as ''pa-[[Pr (hieroglyph)|per]]-aa'' [''p3y pr-<U+02C1>3''] (that which is of [[Pharaoh]]), apparently denoting the Egyptian crown as owning a monopoly on papyrus production. However, no actual ancient text using this term is known. In the [[Egyptian language]], papyrus was known by the terms ''wadj'' [''w3<U+1E0F>''], ''tjufy'' [''<U+1E6F>wfy''], and ''djet'' [''<U+1E0F>t'']. The Greek word ''papyros'' has no known relationship to any Egyptian word or phrase.{{Contradiction-inline|reason=This just after an actual Egyptian phrase is proposed as the source? Sure, it's conjecture, but still, this could be worded better.|date=February 2013}}

== Documents written on papyrus ==
[[File:Papyrus bill of sale donkey.jpeg|thumb|left|Bill of sale for a donkey, papyrus; 19.3 by 7.2&nbsp;cm, MS Gr SM2223, Houghton Library, Harvard University]]

The word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it, often rolled up into scrolls. The plural for such documents is papyri. Historical papyri are given identifying names<U+2014>generally the name of the discoverer, first owner or institution where they are kept<U+2014>and numbered, such as "[[Papyrus Harris I]]". Often an abbreviated form is used, such as "pHarris I". These documents provide important information on ancient writings; they give us the only extant copy of [[Menander]], the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], Egyptian treatises on medicine (the [[Ebers Papyrus]]) and on surgery (the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]]), Egyptian mathematical treatises (the [[Rhind papyrus]]), and Egyptian folk tales (the [[Westcar papyrus]]). When, in the 18th century, a library of ancient papyri was found in [[Herculaneum]], ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time. However, since these papyri were badly charred, their unscrolling and deciphering is still going on today.

== Manufacture and use ==
[[File:Papyrus sheet.svg|thumb|right|Different ways of cutting papyrus stem and making of papyrus sheet]]
[[File:kew.gardens.papyrus.plant.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Papyrus plant ''Cyperus papyrus'' at Kew Gardens, London]]
[[File:Cyperus papyrus-pjt3.jpg|thumb|right|Papyrus plants near [[Syracuse, Sicily]]]]

Papyrus is made from the stem of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''. The outer rind is first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner [[pith]] is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for [[decomposition]] to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together.<ref>''Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography'', Maunde Thompson. [http://www.archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft archive.org]</ref> While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet is then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.<ref>Bierbrier, Morris Leonard, ed. 1986. ''Papyrus: Structure and Usage''. British Museum Occasional Papers 60, ser. ed. Anne Marriott. London: British Museum Press.</ref>

To form the long strip scrolls required, a number of such sheets were united, placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other. Normally, texts were first written on the ''[[recto]]'', the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll. Secondarily, papyrus was often reused, writing across the fibres on the ''[[verso]]''.<ref name = Skeat/> [[Pliny the Elder]] describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.

In a dry [[climate]], like that of Egypt, papyrus is stable, formed as it is of highly rot-resistant [[cellulose]]; but storage in humid conditions can result in [[mold]]s attacking and destroying the material. In European conditions, papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades; a 200-year-old papyrus was considered extraordinary. Imported papyrus once commonplace in [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] has since deteriorated beyond repair, but papyrus is still being found in Egypt; extraordinary examples include the [[Elephantine papyri]] and the famous finds at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Nag Hammadi]]. The [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], containing the library of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law, was preserved by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]], but has only been partially excavated.

Sporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid-18th century. [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorer [[James Bruce]] experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from the [[Sudan]], for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt. Also in the 18th century, [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild. The modern technique of papyrus production used in Egypt for the tourist trade was developed in 1962 by the Egyptian engineer Hassan Ragab using plants that had been reintroduced into Egypt in 1872 from France. Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production.

Papyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps, to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods.<ref>(Maclean et al. 2003b; c).</ref> Particularly in East and Central Africa, people harvest papyrus, which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally. Examples include baskets, hats, fish traps, trays or winnowing mats and floor mats.<ref>Langdon, S. 2000. ''Papyrus and its Uses in Modern Day Russia'', Vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;56<U+2013>59.</ref> Papyrus is also used to make roofs, ceilings, rope and fences. Although alternatives, such as [[eucalyptus]], are increasingly available, papyrus is still used as fuel.<ref>Maclean, I.M.D., R. Tinch, M. Hassall and R.R. Boar. 2003c.
