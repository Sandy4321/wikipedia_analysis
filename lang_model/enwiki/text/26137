'''Black Mountain''' is situated close to the central business district of [[Australia]]'s capital city [[Canberra]]. Like all major hills in Canberra it is protected from development by the [[Canberra Nature Park]]. It is covered in native bushland and is a haven to native wildlife.

With its peak at 812m [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]], Black Mountain rises 256m above the water level of [[Lake Burley Griffin]]. Situated at close to the highest point is [[Telstra Tower]], a broadcasting tower rising a further 195m above the summit.

The [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] and the [[CSIRO]] share the eastern base of Black Mountain, next to the [[Australian National University]].

==Geology==
The bulk of Black Mountain consists of the white quartz Black Mountain [[Sandstone]].  This was deposited in 
the late early [[Silurian]] Age.  On the south east slopes and north west there are exposures of State Circle 
[[Shale]].
The Black Mountain Peninsula contains [[mudstone]] in the north and [[greywacke]] from the [[Ordovician]] age 
Pittman Formation in the south.
[[Natural History of the Australian Capital Territory]] covers more of the geology of the ACT.
