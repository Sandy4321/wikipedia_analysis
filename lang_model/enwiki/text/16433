'''SMS ''Derfflinger'''''<ref group=Note>"SMS" stands for "Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t Schiff", or "His Majesty's Ship" in German.</ref> was a [[World War I]] [[battlecruiser]] of the German [[Kaiserliche Marine]]. The ship was named after [[Brandenburg]] [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] ''Reichsfreiherr'' [[Georg von Derfflinger]] who fought in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. She was the lead ship of her class, her sister ships being {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}} and {{SMS|Hindenburg||2}}. The {{sclass|Derfflinger|battlecruiser|6}}s were larger and featured significant improvements over the preceding German battlecruisers, in terms of armament, armor protection, and cruising range.

''Derfflinger'' was part of the [[I Scouting Group]] for the majority of [[World War I]], and took part in several fleet actions during the war. The ship took part in the bombardments of English coastal towns, as well as the battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]], where the ship's stubborn resistance earned her the nickname "Iron Dog" amongst her British opponents.<ref name=Staff66/>  ''Derfflinger'' was interned with the rest of the High Seas fleet at [[Scapa Flow]] following the German armistice in November 1918. Under the orders of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], the interned German fleet was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled]] on 21 June 1919; ''Derfflinger'' sank at 14:45.

==Construction==
[[Image:SMS Derfflinger crest.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The crest of the ''Derfflinger''; this was displayed on the bow of the ship]]

Built by [[Blohm und Voss]] at their yard in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s keel was laid in January 1912. She was to have been launched on 14 June 1913, but the wooden sledges upon which the ship rested became jammed; the ship moved only 30&ndash;40 centimeters. A second attempt was successful on 12 July 1913. A crew composed of dockyard workers took the ship around the [[Skagen]] to Kiel. In late October, the vessel was assigned to the [[I Scouting Group]], but damage to the ship's [[steam turbine|turbines]] during trials prevented her from joining the unit until 16 November.<ref>Staff, p. 39</ref>

On completion she displaced nearly 27,000 tons and was 210&nbsp;m long. The ship was capable of a top speed of 26.4&nbsp;knots, and could steam for 5,600&nbsp;[[nautical mile]]s at a cruising speed of 14&nbsp;knots. Mounting a main armament of eight [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) guns]], ''Derfflinger'' was the largest and most powerful German battlecruiser at the time.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 56&ndash;57</ref>

====Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby====
{{main|Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby}}
The first operation in which ''Derfflinger'' took part was the raid on the English coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. One raid had already been conducted by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group, on the town of [[Raid on Yarmouth|Yarmouth]] in late 1914. It was decided by Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], the commander of the [[High Seas Fleet]], that another raid on the English coast was to be carried out. The goal was to lure a portion of the [[Grand Fleet]] into combat where it could be isolated and destroyed.<ref>Tarrant, p. 30</ref> At 03:20 on 15 December, Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]], with his flag in {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}, departed the [[Jade estuary]]. Along with ''Seydlitz'', the force consisted of ''Derfflinger'', {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}}, {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, and {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}}, along with the light cruisers ''Kolberg'', ''Strassburg'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Graudenz'', and two squadrons of torpedo boats.<ref name="Tarrant31">Tarrant, p. 31</ref> The ships sailed north past the island of [[Heligoland]], until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 [[dreadnought]]s and eight [[pre-dreadnought]]s and a screening force of two armored cruisers, 7 light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover.<ref name="Tarrant31" />

Some four months earlier, on 26 August 1914, the German light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||2}} had run aground in the [[Gulf of Finland]]; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy, which found code books used by the German navy, along with navigational charts for the North Sea. The Russians passed these documents to the Royal Navy, whose cryptographic unit&mdash;the so-called [[Room 40]]&mdash;began decrypting German signals. On 14 December, they intercepted messages relating to the planned bombardment of Scarborough.<ref name="Tarrant31" /> However, the exact details of the plan were unknown, and it was assumed that the High Seas Fleet would remain safely in port, as in the previous bombardment. Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty's]] four battlecruisers, supported by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the [[Grand Fleet#1st Light Cruiser Squadron|1st Light Cruiser Squadron]], along with the [[2nd Battle Squadron]]'s six dreadnoughts, were to ambush Hipper's battlecruisers.<ref name="Tarrant32">Tarrant, p. 32</ref>

During the night of 15 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.<ref name="Tarrant32" /> Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. ''Derfflinger'' and ''Von der Tann'' went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while ''Seydlitz'', ''Moltke'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' went north to shell Hartlepool.<ref name="Tarrant33">Tarrant, p. 33</ref>  By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.<ref>Scheer, p. 70 </ref>

[[Image:Scheer's illustration of I SG disposition 16 Dec. 1916 en.SVG|thumb|300px|The High Seas Fleet's disposition on the morning of 16 December]] 

By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were positioned to block Hipper's chosen withdrawal route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper.<ref name="Tarrant34"> Tarrant, p. 34 </ref> One of the cruisers in the [[Grand Fleet#2nd Light Cruiser Squadron|2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] spotted ''Stralsund'' and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) ahead.<ref name="Tarrant34" /> The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions.<ref group=Note>Beatty had intended to retain only the two rearmost light cruisers from [[William Goodenough|Goodenough's]] squadron; however, [[HMS Nottingham (1913)|''Nottingham'']]'s signalman misinterpreted the signal, thinking that it was intended for the whole squadron, and thus transmitted it to Goodenough, who ordered his ships back into their screening positions ahead of Beatty's battlecruisers.</ref> This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and escaped.<ref name="Tarrant34" />

Both the British and the Germans were disappointed that they failed to effectively engage their opponents. Admiral Ingenohl's reputation suffered greatly as a result of his timidity. ''Moltke''{{'}} captain was furious; he stated that Ingenohl had turned back "because he was afraid of 11 British destroyers which could have been eliminated...under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing."<ref name="Tarrant35">Tarrant, p. 35</ref> The official German history criticized Ingenohl for failing to use his light forces to determine the size of the British fleet, stating: "he decided on a measure which not only seriously jeopardized his advance forces off the English coast but also deprived the German Fleet of a signal and certain victory."<ref name="Tarrant35"/>

====Battle of Dogger Bank====
{{Main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}

In early January 1915, it became known that British ships were reconnoitering in the [[Dogger Bank]] area.  Admiral Ingenohl was initially reluctant to attempt to destroy these forces, because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while ''Von der Tann'' was in drydock for periodic maintenance. ''Konteradmiral'' [[Richard Eckermann]], the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet, insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank.<ref name="Tarrant36">Tarrant, p. 36</ref> On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with ''Seydlitz'' in the lead, followed by ''Moltke'', ''Derfflinger'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', along with the light cruisers ''Graudenz'', ''Rostock'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Kolberg'' and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. ''Graudenz'' and ''Stralsund'' were assigned to the forward screen, while ''Kolberg'' and ''Rostock'' were assigned to the starboard and port, respectively. Each light cruiser had a half-flotilla of torpedo boats attached.<ref name="Tarrant36" />

Again, interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role. Although they were unaware of the exact plans, the cryptographers of Room 40 deduced that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area.<ref name="Tarrant36" /> To counter it, Beatty's [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]], Rear Admiral Archibald Moore's [[2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]] and Commodore [[William Goodenough]]'s 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were to rendezvous with Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]]'s [[Harwich Force]] at 8:00 on 24 January, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the Dogger Bank.<ref name="Tarrant36" />

At 08:14, ''Kolberg'' spotted the light cruiser {{HMS|Aurora|1913|2}} and several destroyers from the Harwich Force.<ref name="Tarrant38">Tarrant, p. 38</ref>''Aurora'' challenged ''Kolberg'' with a search light, at which point ''Kolberg'' attacked ''Aurora'' and scored two hits. ''Aurora'' returned fire and scored two hits on ''Kolberg'' in retaliation. Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire, when, almost simultaneously, ''Stralsund'' spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position. This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming towards Hipper's ships.<ref name="Tarrant38" /> 

Hipper turned south to flee, but was limited to {{convert|23|kn|km/h}}, which was the maximum speed of the older armored cruiser ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}, and quickly caught up to the German ships. At 09:52, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} opened fire on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' from a range of approximately 20,000&nbsp;yards (18,300&nbsp;m); shortly thereafter, {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}} and {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}} began firing as well.<ref name="Tarrant38" /> At 10:09, the British guns made their first hit on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. Two minutes later, the German ships began returning fire, primarily concentrating on ''Lion'', from a range of 18,000&nbsp;yards (15,460&nbsp;m). At 10:28, ''Lion'' was struck on the waterline, which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker.<ref name="Tarrant39">Tarrant, p. 39</ref> At 10:30, {{HMS|New Zealand|1911|2}}, the fourth ship in Beatty's line, came within range of ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' and opened fire. By 10:35, the range had closed to 17,500&nbsp;yards (16,000&nbsp;m), at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships. Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to engage their German counterparts.<ref group=Note>Thus, ''Lion'' on ''Seydlitz'', ''Tiger'' on ''Moltke'', ''Princess Royal'' on ''Derfflinger'', and ''New Zealand'' on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''.</ref> Confusion aboard ''Tiger'' led the captain to believe he was to fire on ''Seydlitz'', which left ''Moltke'' able to fire without distraction.<ref name="Tarrant39" /> During this period of the battle, ''Derfflinger'' was hit once, but the shell did only minor damage. Two armor plates in the hull were forced inward and some of the protective coal bunkers were flooded.<ref>Tarrant, p. 43</ref>

[[Image:Bluecher sinkend.jpg|left|thumb|''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' capsizing|alt=A sinking gray warship rolls over onti is side, its guns pointed skyward]]
At 10:40, one of ''Lion''{{'}}s {{convert|13.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} shells struck ''Seydlitz'' causing nearly catastrophic damage that knocked out both of the rear turrets and killed 159 men.<ref name="Tarrant40">Tarrant, p. 40</ref> The executive officer ordered the flooding of both magazines to avoid a flash fire that would have destroyed the ship.<ref group=Note>This was to have far-reaching consequences, for immediately after the battle, the German Naval Command launched an investigation which resulted in the adoption of anti-flash measures to prevent the type of spectacular explosions that resulted in the destruction of ''Indefatigable'' and ''Queen Mary'' at [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] a year later. See: Tarrant, p. 40</ref> By this time, the German battlecruisers had zeroed in on ''Lion'', scoring repeated hits. At 11:01, an {{convert|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} shell from ''Seydlitz'' struck ''Lion'' and knocked out two of her dynamos. At 11:18, two of ''Derfflinger's'' {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} shells struck ''Lion'', one of which struck the waterline and penetrated the belt, allowing seawater to enter the port feed tank. ''Lion'' had to turn off its engines due to seawater contamination.<ref name="Tarrant40" />

By this time, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was severely damaged after having been pounded by heavy shells. The chase ended when there were several reports of U-boats ahead of the British ships; Beatty quickly ordered  evasive maneuvers, which allowed the German ships to increase the distance to their pursuers.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 40&ndash;41</ref> At this time, ''Lion''{{'}}s last operational dynamo failed, which dropped her speed to {{convert|15|knots|km/h}}. Beatty, in the stricken ''Lion'', ordered the remaining battlecruisers to "Engage the enemy's rear," but signal confusion caused the ships to solely target ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', allowing ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'', and ''Derfflinger'' to escape.<ref>Tarrant, p. 41</ref> By the time Beatty regained control over his ships, after having boarded ''Princess Royal'', the German ships had too far a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase.<ref>Tarrant, p. 42</ref>

====Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft====
{{Main|Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft}}

''Derfflinger'' also took part in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24&ndash;25&nbsp;April. Hipper was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Konteradmiral [[Friedrich B<U+00F6>dicker]]. ''Derfflinger'', her newly commissioned [[sister ship]] {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}}, and the veterans ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'' and ''Von der Tann'' left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April. They were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas.<ref name= "Tarrant 52"> Tarrant, p. 52</ref> The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for B<U+00F6>dicker's ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German [[wireless]] signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50.<ref name="Tarrant 52"/> 

By 14:00, B<U+00F6>dicker's ships had reached a position off [[Norderney]], at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of [[Terschelling]]. At 15:38, ''Seydlitz'' struck a [[naval mine]], which tore a 50-foot (15&nbsp;m) hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, allowing 1,400&nbsp;short tons (1,250&nbsp;long tons) of water to enter the ship.<ref name="Tarrant 52" /> ''Seydlitz'' turned back, with the screen of light cruisers, at a speed of {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, ''Seydlitz'' was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow B<U+00F6>dicker to disembark. The torpedo boat {{SMS|V28||2}} brought B<U+00F6>dicker to ''L<U+00FC>tzow''.<ref name="Tarrant 53"> Tarrant, p. 53</ref>

At 04:50 on 25 April, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers {{SMS|Rostock||2}} and {{SMS|Elbing||2}}, which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Commodore Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force. B<U+00F6>dicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships' guns on Lowestoft. At a range of approximately 14,000&nbsp;yards, the German battlecruisers destroyed two 6&nbsp;in (15&nbsp;cm) shore batteries and inflicted other damage to the town, including the destruction of some 200 houses.<ref name="Tarrant 53"/>

At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one [[salvo]] each, with the exception of ''Derfflinger'', which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47 encountered for the second time the Harwich Force, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the screening force. B<U+00F6>dicker's ships opened fire from a range of 13,000&nbsp;yards (12,000&nbsp;m).<ref name="Tarrant 54">Tarrant, p. 54</ref> Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser {{HMS|Conquest|1915|2}} sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, B<U+00F6>dicker broke off the chase and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the Grand Fleet's sortie from Scapa Flow, turned back towards Germany.<ref name="Tarrant 54" />

====Battle of Jutland====
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
Almost immediately after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to ''Seydlitz'' had proved difficult to repair&mdash;Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On May 22, the [[Wilhelmshaven]] dockyard reported the ship to be fit for duty, but tests carried out that night showed that the broadside torpedo flat that had been damaged by the mine was still not watertight, and there were still leaks in the fore and aft transverse bulkheads. Further repairs were necessary, and so the operation was postponed another week, by which time the Wilhelmshaven dockyard assured Scheer that the ship would be ready.<ref>Tarrant, p. 58</ref> At noon on 28 May, the repairs to ''Seydlitz'' were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group.<ref name="Tarrant62">Tarrant, p. 62</ref>

[[File:Derfflinger firing full salvo.jpg|thumb|left|''Derfflinger'' fires a broadside salvo|alt=A large warship is partially obscured by smoke from its main guns firing]]
''Derfflinger'' and the rest of Hipper's battlecruisers in the I Scouting Group lay anchored in the outer Jade [[roadstead]] on the night of 30 May 1916. The following morning, at 02:00&nbsp;[[Central European Time|CET]],<ref group=Note>It should be noted that the times mentioned in this section are in [[Central European Time|CET]], which is congruent with the German perspective. This is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], the time zone commonly used in British works.</ref> the ships steamed out towards the [[Skagerrak]] at a speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}.<ref name="Tarrant62">Tarrant, p. 62</ref> ''Derfflinger'' was the second ship in the line of five, ahead of ''Seydlitz'', and to the rear of ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', the group flagship.<ref name="Tarrant62" /><ref group=Note>''L<U+00FC>tzow'' had replaced ''Seydlitz'' as flagship of the I Scouting Group while the latter was in dock for repairs.</ref> The II Scouting Group, consisting of the light cruisers {{SMS|Frankfurt||2}}, Rear Admiral [[Friedrich B<U+00F6>dicker|B<U+00F6>dicker]]'s flagship, {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}}, {{SMS|Pillau||2}}, and {{SMS|Elbing||2}}, and 30 torpedo boats of the II, VI, and IX Flotillas, accompanied Hipper's battlecruisers.<ref name="Tarrant62" />

An hour and a half later, the High Seas Fleet under the command of Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]] left the Jade; the force was composed of 16 dreadnoughts.<ref group=Note>{{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig Albert}} was in dock at the time.</ref> The High Seas Fleet was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers {{SMS|Stettin||2}}, {{SMS|M<U+00FC>nchen||2}}, {{SMS|Hamburg||2}}, {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}}, and {{SMS|Stuttgart||2}}, and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser ''Rostock''. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 5:00.<ref name="Tarrant62" />

Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force encountered Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty's]] battlecruiser squadron. The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000&nbsp;m).<ref>Bennett, p. 183 </ref> When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in ''Moltke'' being engaged by both ''New Zealand'' and ''Tiger''.<ref group=Note>''Tiger'' misread the "distribution of fire" signal hoisted by Beatty's flagship ''Lion''.</ref> The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. Due to errors in British communication, ''Derfflinger'' was unengaged during the first 10 minutes of the battle.<ref group=Note>Beatty intended his first two ships, ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'', to engage ''L<U+00FC>tzow''; ''Queen Mary'' was to have fired on ''Derfflinger'', but her captain misinterpreted his directions and attacked ''Seydlitz'' instead. See: Tarrant, p. 90</ref> ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s gunnery officer, ''Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n'' Georg von Hase later remarked "By some mistake we were being left out. I laughed grimly and now I began to engage our enemy with complete calm, as at gun practice, and with continually increasing accuracy"<ref>Tarrant, p. 90</ref>

[[File:HMS Queen Mary Jutland.jpg|thumb|right|''Queen Mary'' explodes under concentrated salvos  from ''Seydlitz'' and ''Derfflinger'' ]]
Following severe damage inflicted by ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' on ''Lion'', ''Derfflinger'' lost sight of the British ship, and so transferred her fire to {{HMS|Queen Mary}} at 17:16. ''Seydlitz'' was also engaging ''Queen Mary'', and under the combined fire of the two battlecruisers, ''Queen Mary'' was hit repeatedly in quick succession. Observers on ''New Zealand'' and {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}}, the ships behind and ahead, respectively, reported three shells from a salvo of four struck the ship at the same time. Two more hits followed, and a gigantic explosion erupted amidships; a billowing cloud of black smoke poured from the burning ship, which had broken in two.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 100&ndash;101</ref>

The leading ships of the German battle fleet had by 18:00 come within effective range of the British ships, and had begun trading shots with the British battlecruisers and ''Queen Elizabeth''-class battleships. Between 18:09 and 18:19, ''Derfflinger'' was hit by a {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from either {{HMS|Barham|04|2}} or {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}.<ref>Tarrant, p. 118</ref> At 18:55, ''Derfflinger'' was hit again; this shell struck the bow and tore a hole that allowed some 300&nbsp;tons of water to enter the ship.<ref>Tarrant, p. 126</ref>

Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}} had become disabled by a shell from the battlecruiser {{HMS|Invincible|1908|2}}; the German battlecruisers made a 16-point turn to the northeast and made for the crippled cruiser at high speed. The III Battle Squadron of the German fleet, which contained the most powerful battleships of the German navy, also altered course to assist ''Wiesbaden''.<ref>Tarrant, p. 137</ref> Simultaneously, the British III and IV Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered ''Wiesbaden'' with fire from their main guns.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 138&ndash;139</ref> At 19:15, the German battlecruisers spotted the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Defence||2}}, which had joined the attack on ''Wiesbaden''. Hipper initially hesitated, believing the ship was the German cruiser ''Rostock'', but at 19:16, ''Kapitan zur See'' Harder, ''L<U+00FC>tzow''{{'}}s commanding officer, ordered his ships' guns to fire. The other German battlecruisers and battleships joined in the melee; ''Defence'' was struck by several heavy-caliber shells from the German ships. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and a massive explosion destroyed the cruiser.<ref>Tarrant, p. 140</ref>

By 19:24, the [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] had formed up with Beatty's remaining battlecruisers ahead of the German line. The leading British ships spotted ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and ''Derfflinger'' and began firing on them. In the span of 8 minutes, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}} scored eight hits on ''L<U+00FC>tzow''. In return, both ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and ''Derfflinger'' concentrated their fire on their antagonist, and at 19:31, ''Derfflinger'' fired her final salvo at ''Invincible''. Shortly thereafter the forward magazine detonated and the ship disappeared in a series of massive explosions.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 147&ndash;149</ref>

By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, which was by that point pursuing the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack.<ref>Tarrant, p. 150</ref> He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered the main body of the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron. If he chose to use his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat, he would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire.<ref>Tarrant, p. 152</ref> Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 152&ndash;153</ref>

''Derfflinger'' and the other battlecruisers followed the move,<ref group=Note>With the exception of ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', which had lost speed and was unable to keep up.</ref> which put them astern of ''K<U+00F6>nig''.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 155&ndash;156</ref> Hipper's badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location and course of Scheer's ships led Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe]] to turn his ships eastward, towards what he thought was the likely path of the German retreat.<ref>Tarrant, p. 163</ref> The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and pointed his ships at the center of the British fleet.<ref>Tarrant, p. 165</ref> The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent ''Derfflinger'', ''Seydlitz'', ''Moltke'', and ''Von der Tann'' at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat.<ref>Tarrant, p. 173</ref> By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within {{convert|7700|yards|m}} of {{HMS|Colossus|1910|2}}, at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line.<ref>Tarrant, p. 179</ref> Three minutes later, the German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack.<ref>Tarrant, p. 181</ref>

A pause in the battle at dusk allowed ''Derfflinger'' and the other German battlecruisers to cut away wreckage that interfered with the main guns, extinguish fires, repair the fire control and signal equipment, and prepare the searchlights for nighttime action.<ref>Tarrant, p. 188</ref> During this period, the German fleet reorganized into a well-ordered formation in reverse order, when the German light forces encountered the British screen shortly after 21:00. The renewed gunfire gained Beatty's attention, so he turned his battlecruisers westward. At 21:09, he sighted the German battlecruisers, and drew to within {{convert|8500|yards|m}} before opening fire at 20:20.<ref name="Tarrant193">Tarrant, p. 193</ref> In the ensuing melee, ''Derfflinger'' was hit several times; at 21:34, a heavy shell struck her last operational gun turret and put it out of action.<ref name="Tarrant195">Tarrant, p. 195</ref> The German ships returned fire with every gun available, and at 21:32 hit both ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' in the darkness.<ref name="Tarrant195"/> The maneuvering of the German battlecruisers forced the leading I Battle Squadron to turn westward to avoid collision. This brought the pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron directly between the two lines of battlecruisers. In doing so, this prevented the British ships from pursuing their German counterparts when they turned southward. The British battlecruisers opened fire on the old battleships; the German ships turned southwest to bring all of their guns to bear against the British ships. This engagement lasted only a few short minutes before Admiral Mauve turned his ships 8-points to starboard; the British inexplicably did not pursue.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 195&ndash;196</ref>

Close to the end of the battle, at 03:55, Hipper transmitted a report to Admiral Scheer informing him of the tremendous damage his ships had suffered. By that time, ''Derfflinger'' and ''Von der Tann'' each had only two guns in operation, ''Moltke'' was flooded with 1,000&nbsp;tons of water, and ''Seydlitz'' was severely damaged.<ref name="Tarrant255">Tarrant, p. 255</ref> Hipper reported: "I Scouting Group was therefore no longer of any value for a serious engagement, and was consequently directed to return to harbor by the Commander-in-Chief, while he himself determined to await developments off Horns Reef with the battlefleet."<ref name="Tarrant255" />

During the course of the battle, ''Derfflinger'' was hit 17 times by heavy caliber shells and 9 times by secondary guns. The ship was in dock for repairs until 15 October.<ref>Tarrant, p. 277</ref> ''Derfflinger'' fired 385 shells from her main battery, another 235 rounds from her secondary guns, and one torpedo.<ref>Tarrant, p. 292</ref> Her crew suffered 157 men killed and another 26 men wounded; this was the highest casualty rate on any ship not sunk during the battle.<ref>Tarrant, p. 298</ref> Because of her stalwart resistance at Jutland, the British nicknamed her "Iron Dog."<ref name=Staff66>Staff, p. 66</ref>

====Later operations====
In late 1917, the High Seas Fleet began to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, German cruisers and destroyers intercepted and destroyed two British convoys to Norway. This prompted Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys in the North Sea.<ref>Massie, p. 747</ref> This presented to Admiral Scheer the opportunity for which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.<ref name="Massie748">Massie, p. 748</ref> At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters.<ref name="Massie748" />

During the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917, ''Derfflinger'' sailed from port to assist the German light cruisers of the II Scouting Group, but by the time she and the other battlecruisers arrived on the scene, the British raiders had fled northward.<ref>Staff, p. 40</ref>

===Fate===
[[File:Derfflinger's last voyage.jpg|thumb|right|''Derfflinger'' prepares to depart for Scapa Flow]] 
''Derfflinger'' was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the "death ride" of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]]&mdash;by now the ''[[Grand Admiral|Gro<U+00DF>admiral]]'' of the fleet&mdash;intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 280&ndash;281</ref> While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began deserting ''en masse.'' As ''Derfflinger'' and ''Von der Tann'' passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven's inner harbor and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore.<ref>Massie, p. 775</ref> 

On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]] on several battleships; three ships from the III&nbsp;Squadron refused to weigh anchors, and the battleships {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} and {{SMS|Helgoland||2}} reported acts of sabotage. The order to sail was rescinded in the face of this open revolt. The following month, the [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>19|German Revolution]] toppled the monarchy and was quickly followed by the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] that ended the war.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281&ndash;282</ref>

Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies demanded that the majority of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British naval base in [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> On 21 November 1918, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser {{HMS|Cardiff||2}}, before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.<ref>Herwig, pp. 254&ndash;255</ref> Once the ships were interned, their breech locks were removed, which disabled their guns.<ref>Herwig, p. 255</ref> 

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. It became apparent to Reuter that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered his ships be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers. With the majority of the British fleet away, Reuter transmitted the order to his ships at 11:20.<ref>Herwig, p. 256</ref>''Derfflinger'' sank at 14:45. The ship was raised in 1939 and was anchored, still capsized, off the island of [[Risa]] until 1946. ''Derfflinger'' was sent then to [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane Port]], where she was broken up by 1948. The ship's bell was delivered to the German [[German Navy|Federal Navy]] on 30 August 1965.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 57</ref>
