'''Damacio James Page''' (born September 30, 1982) is an American [[mixed martial arts]] fighter currently competing for Legacy Fighting Championship in the [[Bantamweight (MMA)|Bantamweight]] division. While perhaps best known for previously competing in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], he has also competed for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Pancrase]], [[King of the Cage]], TKO Major League MMA, and also fought at K-1 Premium Dynamite 2006!!. 

==Background==
Page was born and raised in the West Side of Albuquerque, New Mexico. His parents divorced when he was five years old and he also began [[kickboxing]] and [[karate]] when he was nine years old. Page often caused trouble in school, getting into fights and being placed in special education classes for his behavior-disorder. In his sophomore year at [[West Mesa High School]] Page began [[wrestling]] and would go on to be a state champion before earning a scholarship to compete for [[Fresno State University]]. However, one night three months into his first semester at Fresno State, Page was attacked by eight gang members who left him severely hurt and barely conscious. Because of the incident and transgressions in the past, Page was kicked off of the wrestling team and subsequently lost his scholarship. After the incident, Page found [[Jackson's Submission Fighting]] and also continued [[collegiate wrestling]] for [[Cerritos College]] in [[Norwalk, California]]. At Cerritos, Page was a [[junior college]] [[All-American]], finishing third in the state during his freshman year and became a state champion in his sophomore year. <ref>http://www.jacksons.tv/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=131&Itemid=</ref><ref>http://www.legacyfights.net/2013/04/legacy-fighting-championship-20-damacio-page/</ref><ref>http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2009/04/wecs-damacio-page-proving-an-angel-of-opportunity-to-new-mexico-youth</ref><ref>http://www.rattling-the-cage.com/admin/interviews/damacio.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.abqjournal.com/sports/140102sports02-14-09.htm</ref>

==Mixed martial arts career==
Page made his professional mixed martial arts debut on February 5, 2005 for the King of the Cage organization. He disposed of his opponent, Will Tolliver, in the first round of their bout with strikes. 

After claiming victory in his next two bouts, Page fought and defeated Scott Johnson for the WEF Super Lightweight title. 

An impressive victory over Stephane Vigneault followed, before Page suffered his first professional defeat. The loss came in his Pancrase debut where he was handled by Japanese fighter, Miki Shida. 

Page closed out 2006 with four more fights, winning the first two by TKO but losing the final two by submission to Danny Batten in September and then UFC veteran and Japanese superstar, [[Genki Sudo]] on New Year's Eve in [[K-1]]. 

Fighting just the once in 2007, Page knocked Rod Montoya out cold at an Extreme Challenge event to improve his record to 6-3.

===World Extreme Cagefighting===
In 2008, Page signed on to fight for the WEC. He made his debut in a [[Bantamweight (MMA)|Bantamweight]] bout against [[Scott Jorgensen]] at [[WEC 32]]. Page slugged out a unanimous decision victory after three rounds. 

Six months later, Page faced the undefeated [[Brian Bowles (fighter)|Brian Bowles]] and was submitted in short order with a guillotine choke. Page later bounced back from his defeat by defeating #5 ranked Bantamweight fighter at the time, [[Marcos Galvao]] at [[WEC 39]] via KO 18 seconds into the first round. He was scheduled to fight [[Akitoshi Tamura]] on October 10, 2009 at [[WEC 43]], but Tamura was forced to pull out due to an injury while training.  Tamura was replaced by WEC newcomer [[Will Campuzano]]. Page defeated Campuzano via first round submission.

Page was expected to face [[Takeya Mizugaki]] on December 19, 2009 at [[WEC 45]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/16567/takeya-mizugaki-vs-damacio-page-in-the-works-for-wec-45-in-december.mma|title=Takeya Mizugaki vs. Damacio Page in the works for WEC 45 in December|publisher=www.mmajunkie.com |accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> but was forced to withdraw from the card due to injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/16663/joseph-benavidez-vs-rani-yahya-set-for-wec-45-in-december.mma|title=Damacio Page won't be part of the WEC 45 card|publisher=www.mmajunkie.com |accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>

Page was scheduled to face [[Antonio Banuelos]] on April 24, 2010 at [[WEC 48]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/17901/antonio-banuelos-inked-to-face-damacio-page-at-wec-48-in-april.mma|title=Antonio Banuelos inked to face Damacio Page at WEC 48 in April|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=2010-02-10}}</ref> but Page was forced off the card with another injury.  Banuelos will now face [[Scott Jorgensen]] in a rematch of their bout from [[WEC 41]] which Banuelos won via split decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/18353/jorgensen-replaces-injured-page-gets-banuelos-rematch-on-wec-48-ppv-main-card.mma|title=Jorgensen replaces injured Page, gets Banuelos rematch on WEC 48 PPV main card|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=2010-03-17}}</ref>

Page was expected to face [[Eddie Wineland]] on November 11, 2010 at [[WEC 52]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/20587/damacio-page-vs-eddie-wineland-slated-for-wec-52-in-november.mma|title=Damacio Page vs. Eddie Wineland slated for WEC 52 in November|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=2010-09-09}}</ref>  However, Wineland was forced out of the bout with a shoulder injury and replaced by [[Demetrious Johnson (fighter)|Demetrious Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/21091/eddie-wineland-out-at-wec-52-demetrious-johnson-faces-damacio-page.mma|title=Eddie Wineland out at WEC 52; Demetrious Johnson faces Damacio Page|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=2010-10-20}}</ref>  After largely controlling the first round against Johnson, Page seemed to visibly tire toward the end of the second and was defeated via third round submission. Page acknowledged that the long layoff may have contributed to his performance, but refused to blame his conditioning and gave credit to his opponent finishing him.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
On October 28, 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. As part of the merger, all WEC fighters were transferred to the UFC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/21189/ufc-and-wec-set-to-merge-in-2011-events-to-air-on-versus-and-spike-tv.mma|title=UFC and WEC set to merge in 2011; events to air on Versus and Spike TV|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=October 28, 2010}}</ref>

Page faced former opponent [[Brian Bowles (fighter)|Brian Bowles]] on March 3, 2011 at [[UFC Live: Sanchez vs. Kampmann]], losing via first round guillotine choke for the second time against Bowles at exactly the same time as their first fight.

Page was expected to face [[Norifumi Yamamoto]] on September 24, 2011 at [[UFC 135]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/23982/bantamweights-kid-yamamoto-vs-damacio-page-targeted-for-ufc-135.mma|title=Bantamweights "Kid" Yamamoto vs. Damacio Page targeted for UFC 135|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=June 13, 2011}}</ref>  However, the bout was scrapped on September 1 after both fighters sustained injuries while training for the bout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/25047/norifumi-kid-yamamoto-vs-damacio-page-scratched-from-ufc-135-prelims.mma|title=Norifumi "Kid" Yamamoto vs. Damacio Page scratched from UFC 135 prelims|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

Page next faced [[Brad Pickett]] on April 14, 2012 at [[UFC on Fuel TV: Gustafsson vs. Silva]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/26907/ufc-on-fuel-tv-2-adds-gustafsson-nogueira-pickett-vs-page-in-sweden.mma|title=UFC on FUEL TV 2 adds Pickett vs. Page in Sweden | publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=January 10, 2012}}</ref>  He lost the fight via submission in the second round.

Page then faced [[Alex Caceres]] on July 11, 2012 at [[UFC on Fuel TV: Munoz vs. Weidman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/28860/ufc-on-fuel-tv-4-adds-page-caceres-njokuani-dos-anjos-deblass-penner-official.mma|title=UFC on FUEL TV 4 adds Page vs. Caceres | publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=May 24, 2012}}</ref> He lost the fight via submission in the second round.

Page was subsequently released from the UFC following his loss to Caceres.

===Post UFC===

Page faced previously undefeated Patrick Ybarra at Legacy Fighting Championship 20 on May 31, 2013.  He won the bout via first round knockout. Page is now expected to fight Matthew Lozano at Legacy Fighting Championship 28 on February 18, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacyfights.net/events/legacy-fighting-championship-28/|title=Legacy Fighting Championship 28 Fight Card|publisher=legacyfights.net}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Damacio's body is decorated with multiple tattoos that all represent deep meaning in his life. Page is a religious man and claims the tattoos are a mosaic of his life. The flames on his feet represent his willingness to walk through hell in order to succeed in life.<ref name="Tattoos">{{cite web |url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Exclusive-Interview-with-the-Angel-of-Death-Damacio-Page.html |title=Exclusive Interview with the "Angel of Death": Damacio Page |accessdate=November 29, 2009| publisher=FiveKnuckles.com|date=2009-11-27}}</ref> He is starting his own MMA promotion, Southwest Cage Fighting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/17621/damacio-page-eyes-may-return-launching-new-fight-promotion-while-healing.mma |title=Damacio Page eyes May return, launching new fight promotion while healing |accessdate=2010-04-21 |publisher=MMAJUNKIE.com |date=2010-01-20}}</ref>
