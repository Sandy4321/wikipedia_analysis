[[Miss Colombia]] is officially known as the ''Concurso Nacional de Belleza de [[Colombia]]'', (''National Beauty Contest''.)  It is the most significant [[beauty pageant|pageant]] in a country that, like neighboring Venezuela, gives incredible weight to beauty contests.  The Miss Colombia pageant elects representatives to [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss International]].  The Miss Mundo Colombia pageant is a separate and smaller event that sends Colombia's representative to [[Miss World]]. The Miss Earth Colombia pageant is a separate yet sizable country-wide search for Colombia's representative to [[Miss Earth]].

The Miss Colombia pageant is one of the most important cultural events in the country, held annually in the city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]].  Massive coverage is given by the media to the contest, including by ''Cromos'' magazine which devotes entire issues to the individual contestants favored to win, and four covers of the magazine are devoted to the pageant in a 4-week period.

Additionally, every major network sends news crews, and even have special sets built by the beach in Cartagena to report live for at least fifteen minutes every day towards the end of the news broadcast on the goings-on of the contestants.  Aspirants must compete in their respective Departments (about twenty of which are represented each year, fluctuating due to the continuing civil unrest in the country) to earn a title for the pageant.  

===Rules===
Colombia has the strictest rules regarding participation of any Miss Universe [[preliminary]]: once a contestant registers for the pageant, she is confined to her own [[State|Department]] and cannot jump states/provinces as happens frequently elsewhere. However, she can participate more than once for the same department; the winner of the pageant in 2003 had already come in fourth place at the Miss Valle pageant the year before she won and eventually went on to win the national crown.

Perhaps this rule is the reason for the intense rivalries that have developed between departments (states) to win the most crowns, a couple of them have garnered a significant number, starting with [[Atl<U+00E1>ntico Department|Atl<U+00E1>ntico]] (9), [[Valle]] (8), [[Santander Department|Santander]] (7), [[Antioquia]] (6).

===Prelude to the Pageant===

The pageant itself always around [[November 11]], and many of the activities, such as the entire production of the Cromos magazines devoted to the pageant take place in the weeks preceding the pageant.

There are a number of preliminary events involving the [[sponsors]], such as the election of the Figura Bodytech (the Bodytech Figure) which confers free gym membership at the Bodytech franchise  for five years to the contestant with the most toned, [[harmonious]] and healthy body of the pageant.

List Of Winners Of Figura Bodytech Prize

*2002 -  Diana Lucia Mantilla (Santander)
*2003 -  Catherine Daza Manchola (Valle del Cauca)
*2004 -  Adriana Tarud (Atlantico)
*2005 -  Valerie Dominguez (Atlantico)
*2006 -  Laura Montoya (Antioquia)
*2007 -  Maria Cristina Diaz Granados Dangond (Bogota)
Interestingly, since the prize was handed out four years ago, the winner of the Bodytech Figure prize has gone on to win Miss Colombia but in 2006 and 2007 they become Runner Ups. There are also prizes for the contestant with the best hair (Silueta Schwarzkopff brand), the most photogenic candidate ([[Kodak]]), the most punctual (who receives a [[Movado]] watch), most beautiful costume, and even the mothers of the delegates must compete in a [[talent show]] to select the "Queen Mother."

==Controversies and Criticism==

The pageant has had its share of controversies, ranging from involvement of the country's powerful [[druglord|drug lords]] (who opulently sponsored many delegates in the early nineties) to allegations of [[racism]]. 

===Involvement of Drug Lords===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MissColombia1991.png|right|thumb|Maribel Guti<U+00E9>rrez Tinoco's preliminary scores during the Miss Universe 1991 pageant. She was unplaced in the contest.]] -->

The involvement of the drug lords became evident when a number of delegates later married their sponsors. 

Miss Choco (1996) Zolima Bechara was disqualified as first runner up (who was to attend [[Miss International]]) when she visited a drug lord in jail. 

Miss Atlantico Maribel Guti<U+00E9>rrez Tinoco who went on to win the Miss Colombia 1990 crown famously stepped down (after her participation in [[Miss Universe 1991]], where she won the Best National Costume Award) to marry "El Mico" Duran, who was later murdered.

===Racism===
In 2001, [[Vanessa Mendoza]] of Choco won the pageant, becoming the first [[black]] woman to do so and setting off an immense debate over the country's treatment of its black minorities.  

A living "[[Cinderella]]" who came from abject [[poverty]], she received numerous awards for her [[humanitarian]] work, including a [[postage stamp]] issued in her honor (rarely accorded to living celebrities, among them Gabriel Garcia Marquez) and government assistance for her home province, one of the country's poorest.  

Despite being the massive favorite of [[Latin America]]n papers to win the [[Miss Universe 2002]] pageant, she did not place.

===Nude Pictorial of Delegates===
A number of candidates have been removed as delegates at the departmental (state) level because they have been featured in advertising for [[underwear]] or in various states of undress. 

In 2005 the pageant was rocked by a scandal when Miss Bogot<U+00E1> (the representative of the country's capital) who was chosen through a [[reality television]] show, was revealed to have posed with a naked torso (her arms covering her breasts) and exposed [[buttocks]] (in a thong) for a health magazine (Salud). She was disqualified by the president of the Concurso Nacional de Belleza (which is a non-profit but private corporation) and the first runner up was also unable to go because she could not prove the 10-year residency requirement. 

Stung by their removal from the pageant, a number of media in [[Bogot<U+00E1>]] attempted to create a scandal over pictures of then-Miss Atlantico Valerie Dominguez who was alleged to have posed in her [[underwear]] for a [[supplement]] of her [[hometown]] newspaper. The committee looked at the pictures and confirmed they were indeed swimwear and she remained in the pageant. She went on to win the Figura Bodytech prize and then the Miss Colombia crown (2005-2006).

===David Letterman on Miss Colombia===
In May 2001, [[David Letterman]] joked about the 'special talent' which the then-reigning Miss Colombia Andrea Noceti possessed - that she was able to "swallow 50 balloons full of [[heroin]]" for the (non existent) [[talent show|talent competition]] in the [[Miss Universe 2001]] pageant. The remark not only infuriated the beauty queen, but also the people in Colombia. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1334464.stm Miss Colombia to sue Letterman]</ref>

Miss Colombia openly threatened to [[lawsuit|sue]] Letterman but later withdrawn the statement after Letterman formally apologised to her in [[The Late Show with David Letterman]] about the quip made. Letterman had invited the beauty queen to appear on his show as a gesture of [[appeasement]]. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1335320.stm Letterman appeases Miss Colombia]</ref>

===Beauty versus Poverty===
Colombia has the distinction of being one of a select few countries where [[taxpayer]] dollars are actually spent on the pageant: some [[state government|departmental governments]] will actually fund their individual contestants, pageants, or even appoint their [[representatives]] to the pageant.

The fact that each regional government [[donation|donates]] a very high sum of money to something apparently useless for a country that has more relevant [[poverty]] problems.

===Feminism===
Feminist groups and advocates also criticize the way women are portrayed in the media, and the sole purpose of an event like this would benefit women at all.
===Stand against Plastic Surgery===
Raimundo Angulo owner of the Se<U+00F1>orita Colombia/Miss Colombia Universe franchise has encouraged pageant hopefuls to refrain from indulging in too much plastic surgery, in an effort to emphasize the importance of natural beauty to young women. Many [[Colombians]] were still surprised with the controversial selection of Miss Colombia 2007 Eileen Roca, who, while allegedly free of any plastic surgery, had not been a media favorite to win the crown.

==International participation==
Despite the country's fascination with pageants and the incredible efforts and funds expended to prepare winners (including appointing them teams of [[fashion designers]] and coaches), it has had a mixed record at international contests.  [[Luz Marina Zuluaga]] remains the country's only Miss Universe, winning in 1958; she was awarded a mansion and [[tax exemption]] for life, an honor which is expected to follow any woman who can retake the world title.  Colombians have come close on several occasions, always making the top 15, and from 1992 to 1994 Miss Colombia consecutively placed as first runner-up, but the [[Miss Universe]] title has continued to elude the country.  In 2004, for example, [[Jeymmy Paola Vargas G<U+00F3>mez]] became the first black woman to win the [[Miss International]] crown.

==Interesting Facts==
{{Trivia|date=August 2007}}
Because of its incredible drawing power in a country facing the effects of [[war]] and [[drug trafficking]], the Miss Colombia pageant remains surrounded by as much [[legend]] and mystery as the neighboring [[Miss Venezuela]] contest.

Among the most notable facts: 

* School children are given two weeks' holiday in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] when the pageant arrives.

* The gold [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] (18 karats, including a beautiful green emerald on a cross decorated with 7 white cubic [[zirconia]] topped by a small crown, surrounded by lions placed upon waves which is the emblem of Cartagena) is designed for the winner by the prestigious and traditional Cesareo Jewelers.

* The winner traditionally confers with the [[President of Colombia]] several times during her reign

* The precious tortoise-shell scepter, gold ring and are carried with Miss Colombia at all times while she is in the country, and must be transferred by her hands to her [[successor]] in Cartagena.
