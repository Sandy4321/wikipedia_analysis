'''Joaqu<U+00ED>n Ram<U+00ED>rez y Sesma''' ([[floruit|fl]] 1835<U+2013>1836) was a 19th-century general for the [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]].

Sesma commanded the [[brigade]] sent in advance of the main body of [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]]'s main body of troops that were heading to put down the [[rebellion]] in the Mexican state of [[Texas]]. His orders were to relieve Gen. [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]] in [[San Antonio]], but news of Cos's surrender (December of 1835) and retreat to [[Laredo, Mexico|Laredo]] reached Mexico shortly after Ram<U+00ED>rez's departure. Ram<U+00ED>rez joined Cos at [[Laredo, Texas]] with 1,000 [[infantry]] and 500 [[cavalry]]. 

Santa Anna linked up with them at the [[Rio Grande River]]. Together the troops advanced to San Antonio, where they seized the Alamo on [[March 6]], [[1836]] after a thirteen day siege. On [[March 11]], Sesma was ordered to go with Gen. [[Adri<U+00E1>n Woll]] to San Felipe de Austin and then to [[Anahuac]]. On [[March 24]], his orders were changed, and he was instructed to support the left wing of [[Jos<U+00E9> de Urrea]]'s forces, but the resistance encountered at Beeson's Ford on the [[Colorado River]] caused Sesma and Woll to camp on the south bank of the river about two miles from the Texas forces on the opposite side. Santa Anna then proceeded with an advance detachment, and Ram<U+00ED>rez followed at a distance. 

He began crossing his troops over the [[Brazos River]] at Thompson's Ferry on [[April 13]] with orders to continue toward Harrisburg. At the time of the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], Sesma was encamped on the right bank of the Brazos near the Old Fort settlement. He joined [[Vicente Filisola]] and the other Mexican generals on [[April 25]] and accompanied the troops in the general Mexican retreat.
