'''Ginevra de<U+2019> Benci''' (born {{circa|1458}}) was an aristocrat from fifteenth-century [[Florence]], admired for her intelligence by Florentine contemporaries.<ref>"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=50442.0&detail=none Ginevra de<U+2019> Benci]". [[National Gallery of Art]]. D.C. Retrieved 7 August 2011.</ref> She is the subject of a portrait painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The oil-on-wood [[portrait]] was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, in 1967, for US$5 million paid to the Princely [[House of Liechtenstein]], a record price at the time, from the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund. It is the only painting by Leonardo on public view in the Americas.<ref>"[http://www.nga.gov/kids/ginevra.htm Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra de' Benci]". [[National Gallery of Art]]. Washington, D.C.

It is known that Leonardo painted a portrait of Ginevra de<U+2019> Benci in 1474, possibly to commemorate her marriage that year to Luigi di Bernardo Niccolini at the age of 16. According to Giorgio Vasari<U+2019>s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' (second edition, 1568), however, Ginevra was not the daughter of Amerigo de<U+2019> Benci, but his wife.<ref>Giorgio Vasari: ''Lives of the Artists'', Volume I. 1987, ISBN 0-14-044500-5, p. 266.</ref> The painting<U+2019>s imagery and the text on the reverse of the panel support the identification of this picture. Directly behind the young lady in the portrait is a [[juniper]] tree. The reverse of the portrait is decorated with a juniper sprig encircled by a wreath of [[Bay laurel|laurel]] and [[Palm tree|palm]] and is memorialized by the phrase <small>VIRTVTEM FORMA DECORAT</small> ("beauty adorns virtue"). The Italian word for juniper is "ginepro", which suggests that the juniper motif was used here as a symbolic pun on Ginevra<U+2019>s name. This pun is not supported by any contemporary historical source, however, and the juniper stood as a symbol of sorrow, pain, and loss in the whole of the Middle Ages. Therefore, the juniper frequently was used in portrait paintings of widows. According to Maike Vogt-Luerssen the woman depicted is not Ginevra de<U+2019> Benci but Fioretta Gorini, the widow of the murdered Giuliano de<U+2019> Medici. The painting was made by Leonardo in 1479/80.<ref>Maike Vogt-Luerssen: ''Die Sforza III: Isabella von Aragon und ihr Hofmaler Leonardo da Vinci'', 2010, ISBN 978-3-8391-7110-3, p. 76.</ref>

The Latin motto <small>VIRTVTEM FORMA DECORAT</small>, on the reverse of the portrait, also is understood as symbolizing her intellectual and moral virtue, while the sprig of juniper ("ginepro"), encircled by laurel and palm, suggests Ginevra's name. The laurel and palm are in the personal emblem of Bernardo Bembo, Venetian ambassador to Florence, whose platonic relationship with Ginevra is revealed in poems dedicated to them. Infrared examination has revealed Bembo's motto "Virtue and Honor" beneath Ginevra's. So it is likely Bembo ordered the emblematic painting on the verso of the portrait.

The portrait is one of the highlights of the National Gallery of Art, and is admired by many for its portrayal of Ginevra's temperament. Ginevra is beautiful, but austere; she has no hint of a smile and her gaze, although forward, seems indifferent to the viewer. A strip from the bottom of the painting was removed in the past, presumably owing to damage, and Ginevra's arms and hands were lost. Using the [[golden section]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] has drawn an interpretation of how her arms and hands may have been positioned in the original.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The adaptation is based on images of hands by Leonardo that are thought to have been executed as studies for this painting.

According to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Ginevra de<U+2019> Benci was also included in the fresco by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] of the Visitation of Mary and Elizabeth in the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, but it is now believed that Vasari made a mistake and that Ghirlandaio painted Giovanna Tornabuoni.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
