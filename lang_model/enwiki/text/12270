== Early years ==

Reich was born in Cuba to a Cuban [[Catholic]] mother and an [[Austria]]n-[[Jew]]ish father, Walter Reich. His father was trying to reach the United States but he remained in [[Havana]], where he settled down, got married, and sold [[furniture]]. At age 14, Otto Reich left with his family for the US as [[refugee]]s a year and half after [[Fidel Castro]] came to power.

In 1966, Reich received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in International Studies from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  From 1967 to 1969, as a paratroop officer, he served as a Civil Affairs officer in the [[United States Army|US Army]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]].  He was awarded the US Army's Commendation Medal.

After receiving an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in Latin American Studies from [[Georgetown University]] in 1973, Reich worked as a staff assistant in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], an international representative for the Florida Department of Commerce, Community Development Coordinator for the City of [[Miami]], and later Washington Director of the [[Council of the Americas]].

From 1981 to 1983, Reich was Assistant Administrator of the US [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) in charge of US economic assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1991 and 1992, at the request of President [[George H. W. Bush]], Reich served as Deputy US Representative to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in [[Geneva]].

== Office of Public Diplomacy ==
{{main|Office of Public Diplomacy}}
From 1983 to 1986, Reich established and managed the inter-agency [[Office of Public Diplomacy| Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean]].  The OPD declassified [[Central Intelligence Agency]] information and disseminated it to influence public opinion and spur Congress to continue to fund the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration's campaign against [[Nicaragua]]'s [[Sandinista]] government. The OPD was highly controversial and was criticized by numerous government sources, including a staff report by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which characterized it as a domestic political and propaganda operation.[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB40/] In 1987, an investigation by the [[United States Comptroller General|Comptroller General]] determined that the OPD engaged in "prohibited, covert propaganda activities, beyond the range of acceptable agency public information activities". The OPD also violated <U+201C>a restriction on the State Department<U+2019>s annual appropriations prohibiting the use of federal funds for publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized by Congress.<U+201D><ref>http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB40/04287.pdf</ref>

== Ambassadorship and Corporate Career ==

From 1986 to 1989, Reich served as Ambassador to [[Venezuela]]. For this service he received the State Department's Superior Honor Award, the Meritorious Service Award and the Republic of Venezuela's Order of the Liberator, the highest honor conferred by that nation. While stationed in Caracas, Reich was said to have been instrumental in the release of [[Orlando Bosch]], a [[Cuban exile]], from jail where he was serving a 10-year sentence for blowing up [[Cubana de Aviaci<U+00F3>n]] Flight 455 on October 6, 1976 while en route from Barbados to Havana. All seventy-three people on board were killed, including many young members of a Cuban fencing team. 

During Senate hearings for his appointment to the Bush administration in 2002, Reich was asked, "Do you consider [[Orlando Bosch]] to be a terrorist?", Reich wrote in response: "I do not have sufficient knowledge of Mr Bosch's criminal activities to pass judgment on his legal status."  [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,646930,00.html]  

From 1989 to 2001, Reich worked as a corporate advisor to clients such as Bell Atlantic, McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Co., AT&T, Bacardi, British American Tobacco, and [[Lockheed Martin]], which sought to sell [[F-16]] fighter aircraft to [[Chile]]. He also reportedly helped draft the [[Helms-Burton Act]] which tightened the Cuban embargo by extendending the territorial application of the initial embargo to apply to foreign companies trading with Cuba.

== 2002 Venezuelan coup ==

Reich held the post of Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the time of the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt]] on April 11, 2002 against [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]]. On the day Pedro Carmona was installed as president, Otto Reich summoned ambassadors from Latin America and the Caribbean to his office to express their support and that of the US administration for the new government.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,688071,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Venezuela coup linked to Bush team | first=Ed | last=Vulliamy | date=December 11, 2002}}</ref>

Administration officials acknowledged that U.S. officials, including officials at the Embassy in Caracas, met with opposition leaders throughout this period.  Meanwhile, the U.S. government denied encouraging the coup, saying they insisted any change in government must take place through constitutional means. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1933526.stm] Because of these allegations, Sen. Christopher Dodd requested a review of US activities leading up to and during the coup attempt.  The OIG report found no wrongdoing by US officials either in the State Department or in the US Embassy.<ref>[http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/13682.pdf Inspector General Report]</ref>

According to a report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Reich warned Congressional aides there was more at stake in Venezuela than simply the success or failure of Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez. He accused Ch<U+00E1>vez of meddling with the historically independent state oil company, providing haven to Colombian guerrillas and bailing out Cuba with preferential rates on oil. He also said the administration had received reports that "foreign paramilitary forces" were involved in the bloody suppression of anti-Ch<U+00E1>vez demonstrators, in which at least fourteen people were killed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20F14F934580C748DDDAD0894DA404482&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fChavez%2c%20Hugo | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Cautioned Leader of Plot Against Ch<U+00E1>vez | first=Christopher | last=Marquis | date=April 17, 2002}}</ref>

The United States, which had acknowledged the ''de facto'' government, did not condemn the coup until Ch<U+00E1>vez had already been restored to power by the Venezuelan military, acting on behalf of a massive popular movement. <ref>[http://embajadausa.org.ve/wwwh1805.html U.S. government statements]</ref> The majority of Latin American presidents, meeting at a conference in Central America, refused to recognize coup leaders' chosen replacement, Pedro Carmona, pressuring them to promptly undo the coup and reinstate elected president Hugo Chavez to Venezuela's presidential palace, Miraflores - on live TV.

==Other activities==

In 2002, Reich was also nominated to serve on the board of the controversial [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation]], formerly known as the School of the Americas, a U.S. army institution that instructed the Latin American military in torture techniques.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0205/S00006.htm Scoop: Otto Reich Named on Board to Oversee SOA]</ref><ref>[http://www.workingforchange.com/printitem.cfm?itemid=17055 CREDO Action<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a member of the board, Reich's job was to review and advise "on areas such as curriculum, academic instruction, and fiscal affairs of the institute."<ref>{{cite news |title= Honduran Destablization, Inc.: Otto Reich and the International Republican Institute |author= Nicholas Kozoloff |newspaper= Counterpunch |date= 9 July 2009|url= http://www.counterpunch.org/kozloff07092009.html}}</ref> 

He also served as  vice-chairman of Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP), an employers' organization which monitors the use of [[sweatshop]]s and has been criticized by anti-sweatshop activists.<ref>[http://www.behindthelabel.org/infocus.php?infocus_id=86 Behind the Label - You Can Make a Difference]</ref>
From 1998 to 2001, Reich was co-host of CNN International<U+2019>s <U+201C>Choque de Opiniones,<U+201D> a Spanish-language version of CNN<U+2019>s <U+201C>Crossfire.<U+201D>  He appears regularly on US and Latin American media.

During the 2008 US Presidential elections, Reich served as a foreign policy adviser to [[John McCain]].<ref name=cp090709>[[CounterPunch]], 9 July 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/kozloff07092009.html Otto Reich and the International Republican Institute: Honduran Destablization, Inc.]</ref>
