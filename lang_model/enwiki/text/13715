'''SM ''UB-7''''' was a German [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] in the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. She disappeared in the [[Black Sea]] in September 1916.

''UB-7'' was ordered in October 1914 and was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in November. ''UB-7'' was a little under {{convert|92|ft|m}} in length and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] between {{convert|127|and|141|MT|ST}}, depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two [[torpedo]]es for her two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and was also armed with a deck-mounted [[machine gun]]. ''UB-7'' was originally one of a pair of UB I boats sent to the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] to replace an Austrian pair to be sent to the [[Dardanelles]], and was broken into sections and shipped by rail to [[Pula|Pola]] in March 1915 for reassembly. She was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in April and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed as SM ''UB-7'' in the German Imperial Navy in May when the Austrians opted out of the agreement.<ref group=Note>"SM" stands for "Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t" ({{lang-en|His Majesty's}}) and combined with the ''U'' for ''Unterseeboot'' would be translated as ''His Majesty's Submarine''.</ref>

Although briefly a part of the [[Pola Flotilla]] at commissioning, ''UB-7'' spent the majority of her career patrolling the [[Black Sea]] as part of the [[Constantinople Flotilla]]. The U-boat sank one ship of {{GRT|6011|first=short}} in September 1915. In October, she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria. She was considered for transfer to the [[Bulgarian Navy]], but disappeared in late September 1916 before a transfer could take place. Her fate is officially unknown, but sources report that may have struck a mine or been sunk by a Russian airplane.

== Design and construction ==
After the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the [[German Imperial Navy]] found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off [[Flanders]].<!-- advance, caught w/o equipment --><ref name=Miller-46>Miller, pp. 46<U+2013>47.</ref><ref name=Karau-48>Karau, p. 48.</ref><!-- nature of waters off Flanders --> Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914,<ref name=Karau-48 /> produced the [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about {{convert|92|ft|m}} long and displacing about {{convert|125|MT|ST}} with two [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=Miller-46 /><ref group=Note>A further refinement of the design<U+2014>replacing the torpedo tubes with [[mine (naval)|mine]] chutes but changing little else<U+2014>evolved into the [[German Type UC I submarine|Type UC I]] coastal [[minelayer|minelaying]] submarine. See: Miller, p. 458.</ref> ''UB-7'' was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines<U+2014>numbered {{SMU|UB-1||2}} to {{SMU|UB-8||2}}<U+2014>ordered on 15 October from [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]], just shy of two months after planning for the class began.<ref name=Miller-46 /><ref name=Williamson>Williamson, p. 12.</ref>

''UB-7'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 30 November.<ref name=UB-7 /> As built, ''UB-7'' was {{convert|92|ft|2|in|m}} long, {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], and had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|9|ft|10|in|m}}.<ref name=Con-180 /> She had a single {{convert|60|bhp|adj=on}} [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler]] 4-cylinder [[diesel engine]] for surface travel, and a single {{convert|120|shp|adj=on}} [[Siemens-Schuckert]] [[electric motor]] for underwater travel, both attached to a single [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]].<ref name=Con-180 /> Her top speeds were {{convert|6.47|knots|km/h}}, surfaced, and {{convert|5.51|knots|km/h}}, submerged.<ref name=Tarrant-172 /> At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to {{convert|1650|nmi|km}} on the surface before refueling, and up to {{convert|45|nmi|km}} submerged before recharging her batteries.<ref name=Con-180 /> Like all boats of the class, ''UB-7'' was rated to a diving depth of {{convert|50|m|ft}}, and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.<ref name=Con-180 />

''UB-7'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[torpedo]]es in two bow [[torpedo tube]]s. She was also outfitted for a single {{convert|8|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[machine gun]] on deck.<ref name=Con-180 /> ''UB-7''{{'}}s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.<ref name=Karau-49>Karau, p. 49.</ref>

While ''UB-7''{{'}}s construction neared completion in early March 1915, [[Enver Pasha]] and other Turkish leaders were pleading with their German and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions.<ref name=Halp-116>Halpern, p. 116.</ref> The Germans induced the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und K<U+00F6>nigliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) to send two boats<U+2014>its own Germaniawerft-built boats {{SMU|U-3|Austria-Hungary|2}} and {{SMU|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2}}<U+2014>with the promise of ''UB-7'' and ''UB-8'' as replacements.<ref name=Kob-82>Koburger, p. 82.</ref>

When work on ''UB-7'' and ''UB-8'' was complete at the Germaniwerft yard, they were both readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a [[complete knock down|knock down kit]]. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway [[flatcar]]s.<ref name=Karau-49 /> The boats were ready for shipment to the main Austrian naval base at [[Pula|Pola]] on 15 March, despite the fact that the Austrian pair was still not ready.<ref name=Kob-82 /> German engineers and technicians that accompanied the German boats to Pola worked under the supervision of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' Hans Adam, head of the newly created U-boat special command ({{lang-de|Sonderkommando}}).<ref name=Kob-82 /> Typically, the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks,<ref name=Karau-49 /> and, accordingly, ''UB-7'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed at Pola sometime in April.<ref name=Miramar />

== Career ==
During her trials, ''UB-7'' developed a leak which took some time to repair.<ref name=Kob-82-83>Koburger, pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref> In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of ''U-7'' and an Austrian commander.<!-- assigned "a" number, Austrian commander --><ref name=Kob-82-83 /><ref name=Con-341>Gardiner, p. 341.</ref><!-- A-H "U-7" --> Her German crew at Pola<U+2014>since it was still the intent for ''UB-7'' to be transferred to the ''K.u.K. Kriegsmarine''<U+2014>wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms.<ref name=Kob-82-83 /> As time dragged on, the Austrian ''U-3'' and ''U-4'' were still not ready,<ref group=Note>The Austrian {{SMU|U-3|Austria-Hungary|2}} had developed a leak and was undergoing repairs that eventually kept her at Pola until 27 April. See: {{cite web | title = Tengeralattj<U+00E1>r<U+00F3>k | url = http://www.kriegsmarine.hu/hk/tengeralattjarok.pdf | format = pdf | language = Hungarian | publisher = Imperial and Royal Navy Association | date =  | pages = p. 3 | accessdate = 4 April 2009 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref> and eventually Admiral [[Anton Haus]], the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.<ref name=Halp-116 /><ref group=Note>Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915.</ref>

With the change of heart from the Austrians, Germany resolved to retain ''UB-7'' and send her to the aid of the Turks.<ref name=Sond-268>Sondhaus, p. 268.</ref> So, upon completion of her leak repairs, the boat was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the German Imperial Navy as SM ''UB-7'' on 6 May under the command of ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' [[Wilhelm Werner]],<ref name=UB-7 /> a 26-year-old native of Apola.<ref name=werner>{{cite Uboat.net | name = Wilhelm Werner | id = 400 | type = 1comm | accessdate = 4 April 2009 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref><ref group=Note>Werner was in the Navy's April 1905 cadet class with 36 other future U-boat captains, including [[Hermann von Fischel]], [[Carl-Siegfried Ritter von Georg]], [[Kurt Hartwig]], and [[Hans von Mellenthin]].

Because of her limited range, ''UB-7'' would not have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey, so on the night on 15/16 May, she was towed by the Austrian destroyer {{SMS|Triglav}} through the [[Straits of Otranto]] and into the [[Ionian Sea]].<ref name=Sond-268 /><ref group=Note>{{SM|UB-8||2}} had been similarly towed by the Austrian cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1912|2}} on 2 May.</ref> By June,<ref>Polmar and Noot, p. 56.</ref> ''UB-7'' had reached [[<U+0130>zmir|Smyrna]]<U+2014>not having any success on her journey there<ref name=Halp-118>Halpern, p. 118.</ref><U+2014>and joined {{SMU|U-21||2}} and ''UB-8'' in the [[Constantinople Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|U-boote der Mittelmeer division in Konstantinopel}}).<ref name=Tarrant-23>Tarrant, p. 23.</ref> Once there, ''UB-7'' was ineffective because she was hampered by her limited torpedo supply and her weak engines, which made negotiating the strong Dardanelles currents nearly impossible.<ref name=Halp-118 /> Because of this, ''UB-7'' was sent to patrol in the [[Black Sea]] in July, cruising without success from the 5th to the 22nd.<ref name=Halp-233>Halpern, p. 233.</ref>

In September 1915, ''UB-7'' and ''UB-8'' were sent to [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]], and from there, to patrol off the Russian Black Sea coast. On 18 September, ''UB-7'' torpedoed and sank the British steamer ''Patagonia'' about {{convert|10.5|nmi|km}} from [[Odessa]].<ref name=Tenn-190>Tennent, p. 190.</ref><ref group=Note>''Patagonia''<U+2014>cut off from the United Kingdom because the only exit from the Black Sea, the [[Bosporus]], was under Ottoman cotrol<U+2014>was in service as a Russian naval transport when she was sunk.

Because [[Bulgaria]] had joined the [[Central Powers]], battleships of the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]], and aircraft from the [[seaplane carrier]]s {{ship|Russian cruiser|Almaz||2}} and {{ship|Russian seaplane carrier|Imperator Nikolai I||2}} began attacks on  Varna and the Bulgarian coast on 25 October. ''UB-7'' and ''UB-8'', both based out of [[Varna]] by this time, sortied to disrupt the bombardment.<ref name=Halp-236>Halpern, p. 236.</ref> Off Varna on the 27th, ''UB-7'' got in position to fire a torpedo at the {{ship|Russian battleship|Panteleimon||2|up=on}} (most well-known under her former name of ''Potemkin'').<ref name=GP-73>Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 73<U+2013>74.</ref> Although ''UB-7''{{'}}s crew heard what they thought was the torpedo explode, it did not hit ''Panteleimon''. Despite the lack of success, the attempt did cause the Russians to break off their attacks and withdraw.<ref name=Halp-236 />

In early 1916, ''UB-7'' and ''UB-8'' were still cruising in the Black Sea out of Varna.<ref name=GP-124<U+2013>25>Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 124<U+2013>25.</ref> The Germans did not have good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them.<ref name=Halp-233 /> The Bulgarians, who saw the value of the submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase ''UB-7'' and ''UB-8''.<ref>Miller, pp. 46<U+2013>47.</ref> Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to [[Kiel]] for training at the German submarine school there.<ref name=Panayotov>{{cite web | last = <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432> | first = <U+0410><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0441> | title = <U+041D><U+0430><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0434><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+043D><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> <U+043A><U+043E><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+043E><U+043F><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0435> <U+0438> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0431><U+043E><U+0439><U+043D><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> <U+0438><U+0437><U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0437><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0434><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0432> <U+0431><U+044A><U+043B><U+0433><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0435><U+043D><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0444><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442> | url = http://www.submariners.m-sat.bg/publikacii/nachalo-bg-pl.htm | language = Bulgarian | publisher = <U+0421><U+044A><U+044E><U+0437> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0434><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+0420><U+0435><U+043F><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0411><U+044A><U+043B><U+0433><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F> | accessdate = 5 April 2009 | dateformat = dmy }}</ref><ref name=Jordanov><U+0419><U+043E><U+0440><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, pp. 130<U+2013>145.</ref> The transfer of ''UB-8'' to the [[Bulgarian Navy]] took place on 25 May 1916,<ref name=Jordanov /> but for reasons unreported in sources, ''UB-7'' remained under the German flag.

With the submarine out of the way, Rear Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] sortied with [[dreadnought]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Mariya||2}}, cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Kagul||2}}, and five destroyers. The Russian fleet engaged ''Breslau'', which was forced to abort her mission and retire. Sources are quiet on damage, if any, suffered by ''UB-7''.<ref name=Halp-246 />
