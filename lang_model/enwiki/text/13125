'''Canaan''' ([[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]]: <U+05DB><U+05E0><U+05E2><U+05DF>, {{lang-he|<U+05DB><U+05B0><U+05BC><U+05E0><U+05B7><U+05E2><U+05B7><U+05DF>}}  {{IPA|k<U+0259>.na.<U+0295>an}}, [[Koine Greek|Greek]]: <U+03A7><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03AC><U+03BD> whence [[Latin]]: ''Canaan''; and from Hebrew, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: {{Unicode|<U+071F><U+0722><U+0725><U+0722>}} whence {{lang-ar|<U+06A9><U+0646><U+0639><U+0627><U+0646>}}) is an ancient term for a region approximating to present-day [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank and Gaza]], plus adjoining coastal lands and parts of [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies Canaan with Lebanon <U+2014> foremost with the coastal city of Sidon <U+2014> but extends the "Land of Canaan" southward across [[Gaza]] to the "[[Brook of Egypt]]" and eastward to the [[Jordan Valley]], thus including modern [[Israel]] with the [[Palestinian Territories]]. This southern area included various ethnic groups. The [[Amarna Letters]] found in [[Ancient Egypt]] mention Canaan ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''{{unicode|Kina<U+1E2B><U+1E2B>u}}'') in connection with Gaza and other cities along the [[Phoenicia]]n coast and into Upper [[Galilee]].  Many earlier Egyptian sources also make mention of numerous campaigns conducted in ''Ka-na-na'', just inside Asia.

Various Canaanite sites have been excavated by archaeologists, most notably the Canaanite town of [[Ugarit]] in modern Syria, which was rediscovered in [[1928]].  Much of the modern knowledge about the Canaanites stems from excavation in this area. Canaanites are mentioned in the [[Bible]], Mesopotamian and [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian texts]], and have always normally been considered an ethnic group radiating out of Lebanon; though some recent sources, without specifying any evidence, have asserted an origin on the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Bernard Lewis (2002), The Arabs in History, Oxford University Press, USA; 6 New Edition, p. 17.</ref><ref name = "History">http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=201334</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Template:History of the Levant}}
In linguistic terms, ''Canaanite'' refers to the common ancestor of closely related [[Semitic languages]]. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is a southern dialect of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite language]], and [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] a northern one.  Canaanite is the first language to use a [[Semitic]] [[alphabet]], from which most other scripts derive.

The name ''Canaan'' is of obscure origins, with one possibility being the non-Semitic [[Hurrian]] "Knaa" or Akkadian ''Kinahhu'', meaning "blue cloth snails". The first known references appear in the [[2nd millennium BC]], possibly from Hurrian sources in the [[Mesopotamian]] city of [[Nuzi]].

The [[Bible]] attributes the name to Canaan, the son of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]] and the grandson of [[Noah]], whose offspring correspond to the names of various ethnic groups in the land of Canaan, listed in the Table of Nations ({{niv|Genesis|10|Gn 10}}). The Table associates Canaan foremost with the coastal city of Sidon in modern Lebanon. While acknowledging the hegemony of the Canaanites, they are considered one ethnic group among several in the area, including biblical "[[Hittites]]" from Hatti in modern Turkey. Also in modern Turkey were the Lydians.

Nowadays, the English word ''Canaanite'' can describe anything pertaining to Canaan, especially its culture, its languages and its inhabitants. The language of ancient Amon and Moab in modern Jordan can be called eastern dialects of [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], although these ethnic groups are not Canaanite, properly speaking.

==Canaan in Mesopotamian inscriptions==
Canaan is mentioned in a document from the [[18th century BC]] found in the ruins of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], a former [[Sumer]]ian outpost in Syria. Apparently Canaan at this time existed as a distinct political entity (probably a loose confederation of city-states). 

Soon after this, the great empire-builder and law-giver [[Hammurabi]] ([[1728 BC]]<U+2013>[[1686 BC]]), first king of a united [[Babylonia]], extended Babylonian influence over Canaan and Syria. E. Schrader<ref name = "Schrader1888 299">SCHRADER, E.  Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament, vol II (1888), pp. 299ff.</ref> associated Hammurabi with the [[Amraphel]] of ''Genesis'', but according to The Oxford Companion to the Bible, this view has been largely abandoned in recent years.<ref name = "Oxford">The Oxford Companion to the Bible.</ref>

Tablets found in the Mesopotamian city of [[Nuzi]] use the term ''Kinahnu'' ("Canaan") as a synonym for red or purple dye, produced from [[murex]] shells on the Mediterranean coast, apparently a renowned Canaanite export commodity. The dyes were likely named after their place of origin (much as "[[champagne (beverage)|champagne]]" is both a product, and the name of the region where it is produced). The name 'Phoenicia' is connected with the Greek word for "purple', apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or ''vice versa''.  The purple cloth of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in Phoenicia was well known far and wide.

Archaeological excavations of a number of sites later identified as Canaanite, show that prosperity of the region reached its apogee during this Middle [[Bronze Age]] period, under the leadership of the city of [[Hazor]].  In the north the cities of [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]] were [[hegemons]] of important [[Confederation|confederacies]] and it would appear that Biblical [[Hazor]] was the chief city of another important [[coalition]] in the south.  In the early Late Bronze Age, Canaanite confederacies were centred on [[Megiddo]] and [[Kadesh]], before being brought into the [[Egyptian New Kingdom|Egyptian Empire]].

==Egyptian Canaan==
[[Image:KAnana.gif|thumb|left|200px|The name ''Canaan'' occurs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] as ''kAnana'' on the [[Merneptah Stele]] in the 13th century BC]]
During the [[2nd millennium BC]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts use the term ''Canaan'' to refer to an Egyptian province, whose boundaries generally corroborate the definition of Canaan found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], bounded to the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], to the north in the vicinity of [[Hamath]] in Syria, to the east by the [[Jordan Valley]], and to the south by a line extended from the [[Dead Sea]] to around [[Gaza]] ({{Niv|Numbers|34:1<U+2013>12|Numbers 34}}).  Nevertheless, the Egyptian and Hebrew uses of the term are not identical: the Egyptian texts also identify the coastal city of [[Kadesh|Qadesh]] in Syria near Turkey as part of the "Land of Canaan", so that the Egyptian usage seems to refer to the entire [[Levant|levantine]] coast of the Mediterranean Sea, making it a synonym of another Egyptian term for this coastland, '''''[[Retenu]]'''''.

There is uncertainty about whether the name ''Canaan'' refers to a specific ethnic group wherever they live, the homeland of this ethnic group, or a region under the control of this ethnic group, or perhaps any of the three. 

At the end of what is referred to as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] era of Egypt, was a breakdown in centralised power, the assertion of independence by various [[nomarchs]] and the assumption of power in the Delta by  [[Pharaohs]] of the 17th Dynasty. Around [[1674 BC]], these  rulers, whom the Egyptians referred to as "rulers of foreign lands" (Egyptian, ''Heqa Khasut''), hence "[[Hyksos]]" (Greek), came to control [[Lower Egypt]] (northern Egypt), evidently leaving Canaan an ethnically diverse land.

Among the migrant tribes who appear to have settled in the region were the [[Amorites]]. In the [[Old Testament]], we find ''Amorites'' mentioned in the ''[[Table of Nations|Table of Peoples]]'' (Gen. 10:16-18a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Gen. 14:7 ''f''., Josh. 10:5 ''f''., Deut. 1:19 ''f''., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while in Num. 21:13, Josh. 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc., we hear of two great Amorite kings residing at [[Heshbon]] and [[Ashtaroth]], east of the Jordan. However, in other passages such as Gen. 15:16, 48:22, Josh. 24:15, Judg. 1:34, etc., the name ''Amorite'' is regarded as synonymous with "Canaanite" <U+2014> only "Amorite" is never used for the population on the coast. 

In Egyptian inscriptions ''Amar'' and ''Amurru'' are applied strictly to the more northerly mountain region east of Phoenicia, extending to the [[Orontes River|Orontes]]. Later on, ''Amurru'' became the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] term for the interior of south as well as for northerly Canaan.  At this time the Canaanite area seemed divided between two confederacies, one centred upon [[Megiddo]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]], the second on the more northerly city of [[Kadesh]] on the [[Orontes River]].

In the centuries preceding the appearance of the Biblical Hebrews, Canaan and [[Syria]] became tributary to the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s, although domination by the sovereign was not so strong as to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Under [[Thutmose III]] ([[1479 BC|1479]]<U+2013>[[1426 BC]]) and [[Amenhotep II]] ([[1427 BC|1427]]<U+2013>[[1400 BC]]), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Syrians and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. The reign of [[Amenhotep III]], however, was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province. It is believed that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule could not find them without the help of a neighboring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was [[Aziru]], son of [[Abd-Ashirta]], a prince of Amurru, who even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of [[Damascus]].  [[Akizzi]], governor of [[Katna]] (near [[Hamath]]), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate his attempts. In the next reign, however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like [[Rib-Addi]], governor of [[Byblos|Gubla]] (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring [[Hittites]] under [[Suppiluliuma I]].

Egyptian power in Canaan thus suffered a major setback when the [[Hittites]] (or [[Hatti]]) advanced into Syria in the reign of Amenhotep III, and became even more threatening in that of his successor, displacing the Amurru and prompting a resumption of Semitic migration.  Abd-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with other external powers, attacked the districts remaining loyal to Egypt.  In vain did Rib-Addi send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages. 

In the el [[Amarna letters]] (~1350 BC) sent by governors and princes of Canaan to their Egyptian overlord [[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) in the [[14th century BC]] <U+2014> commonly known as the [[Amarna tablets|Tel-el-Amarna tablets]] <U+2014> we find, beside ''Amar'' and ''Amurru'' (Amorites), the two forms ''Kinahhi'' and ''Kinahni'', corresponding to ''Kena''' and ''Kena'an'' respectively, and including Syria in its widest extent, as [[Eduard Meyer]] has shown. The letters are written in the official and diplomatic [[Akkadian language]], though "Canaanitish" words and idioms are also in evidence.

[[Seti I]] (ca. [[1290 BC]]) is said to have conquered the ''Shasu'', Arabian nomads living just south and east of the [[Dead Sea]], from the fortress of Taru (Shtir?) to "''Ka-n-'-na''", and [[Ramesses III]] (ca. [[1194 BC]]) is said to have built a temple to the god [[Amun|Amen]] in "''Ka-n-'-na''". This geographic name probably meant all of western [[Syria]] and Canaan, with Raphia, "the (first) city of the ''Ka-n-'-na''", on the southwest boundary toward the desert. Some [[archaeology|archaeologist]]s have proposed that Egyptian records of the [[13th century BC]] are early written reports of a [[monotheistic]] belief in ''[[Yahweh]]'' noted among the nomadic Shasu.  Evidently, belief in Yahweh displaced polytheistic beliefs that had arisen among the early Hebrews, during and after the reign of King [[Josiah]] ([[650s BC|around 650 BC]])<ref name = "Dever">''Who Were the Early Israelites?'', [[William G. Dever]]. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2003, pp. 128, 236.</ref><ref name = "Silberman">[[Neil A. Silberman]] and [[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Bible Unearthed''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001.</ref>.

Most interesting is the mention of troublesome groups called sometimes ''SA-GAZ'' (a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ideogram glossed as "brigand" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and sometimes ''[[Habiru|Habiri]]'' (an Akkadian word). These Habiri are believed by some to signify generally all the nomadic tribes known as "Hebrews", and particularly the early Israelites, who sought to appropriate the fertile region for themselves. The term may also include other related peoples such as the [[Moabites]], [[Ammonites]] and [[Edomites]], or may not be an [[ethnonym]] at all; see the [[Habiru]] article for details.

In the El [[Amarna letters]](~1350 BC), we meet with the Habiri in northern Syria. Itakkama wrote thus to the Pharaoh, "Behold, Namyawaza has surrendered all the cities of the king, my lord to the SA-GAZ in the land of [[Kadesh]] and in [[Ubi]]. But I will go, and if thy gods and thy sun go before me, I will bring back the cities to the king, my lord, from the Habiri, to show myself subject to him; and I will expel the SA-GAZ." Similarly Zimrida, king of [[Sidon]], declared, "All my cities which the king has given into my hand, have come into the hand of the Habiri." The king of [[Jerusalem]], [[Abdi-heba]], reported to the Pharaoh, "If (Egyptian) troops come this year, lands and princes will remain to the king, my lord; but if troops come not, these lands and princes will not remain to the king, my lord." Abdi-heba's principle trouble arose from persons called [[Iilkili]] and the sons of [[Labaya]], who are said to have entered into a treasonable league with the Habiri. Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of [[Gina]].  All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Itakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh, "Behold, I and my warriors and my chariots, together with my brethren and my SA-GAZ, and my Suti ?9 are at the disposal of the (royal) troops to go whithersoever the king, my lord, commands".<ref name = "EA189">El Amarna letter, EA 189.</ref>

==Early Development of Canaanite civilisation==

The urban development of Canaan lagged considerably behind that of Egypt and Mesopotamia and even that of Syria, where from 3,500 BCE a sizable city developed at Hamoukar. This city, which was conquered, probably by people coming from the Southern Iraqi city of Uruk, saw the first connections between Syria and Southern Iraq that some[1][2] have suggested lie behind the patriarchal traditions. Urban development again began culminating in the Early Bronze Age development of sites like Ebla, which by 2,300 BCE was incorporated once again into an Empire of Sargon, and then Naram-Sin of Akkad (Biblical Accad). The archives of Ebla show reference to a number of Biblical sites, including Hazor, Jerusalem, and a number of people have claimed, also to Sodom and Gomorrah, mentioned in the patriarchal records. The collapse of the Akkadian Empire, saw the arrival of peoples using Khirbet Kerak Ware pottery,[3] coming originally from the Zagros Mountains, east of the Tigris. It is suspected by some [1] that this event marks the arrival in Syria and Palestine of the Hurrians, people later known in the Biblical tradition possibly as Horites.

==Biblical Canaanites==
Ultimately, the [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies Canaan ({{lang-he|<U+05DB><U+05B0><U+05BC><U+05E0><U+05B7><U+05E2><U+05B7><U+05DF>}}, ''Knaan'') with the coastal city of [[Sidon]], in modern Lebanon. This city dominated the Mediterranean coast and enjoyed wide hegemony over a number of ethnic groups, who are said to belong to the "Land of Canaan". The part of the book of [[Genesis]] often called the [[Table of Nations]] describes the Canaanites as being descended from a personifying ancestor called Canaan, saying ({{Niv|Genesis|10:15-19|Genesis 10:15<U+2013>19}}):

<blockquote>Canaan is the father of Sidon, his firstborn; and of the [[Hittites]], [[Jebusites]], [[Amorites]], [[Girgashites]], [[Hivites]], [[Arkites]], [[Sinites]], [[Arvadites]], [[Zemarites]], and [[Hamathites]]. Later the Canaanite clans scattered, and the borders of Canaan reached [across the Mediterranean coast] from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then [inland around the Jordan Valley] toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.</blockquote>

Similarly, Canaanite populations are said to inhabit:
*the [[Mediterranean]] coastlands ({{Niv|Joshua|5:1|Joshua 5:1}}), including [[Lebanon]] corresponding to [[Phoenicia]] ({{Niv|Isaiah|23:11|Isaiah 23:11}}) and the [[Gaza Strip]] corresponding to [[Philistia]] ({{Niv|Zephaniah|2:5|Zephania 2:5}}).
*the [[Jordan Valley]] ({{Niv|Joshua|11:3|Joshua 11:3}}, {{Niv|Numbers|13:29|Numbers 13:29}}, {{Niv|Genesis|13:12|Genesis 13:12}}).

During the Canaanite Period of the [[Archaeology of Israel]], the cities of Canaan were ruled by vassals of the [[Egyptian Empire]]. The Table of Nations recognizes Egypt's regional influence and calls Canaan himself the "son of Ham", whose ethnicities, e.g. Egypt ("Mitzrayim"), are associated with Africa ({{Niv|Genesis|10:6|Genesis 10:6}}).

A biblical story involving Canaan seems to refer to the ancient discovery of the [[agriculture#history|cultivation]] of [[grapes]] around 4000 BC around the area of [[Ararat]], which is associated with [[Noah]].<ref>http://www.savoreachglass.com/articles.php/13</ref> After the Flood, [[Noah]] planted a vineyard, made wine but became drunk. While intoxicated, an [[Curse of Ham|incident]] occurred involving him and his youngest son, [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]]. Afterward, Noah cursed Ham's son Canaan (but not Ham, for reasons that are not stated) to a life of servitude.  He is to serve his brothers (who were not cursed either) and also his uncles [[Shem]] and [[Japheth]] ({{Niv |Genesis|9:20-27|Genesis 9:20<U+2013>27}}). Noah's curse is typically interpreted to apply to the descendants of the mentioned figures. "Shem" refers the [[Israelites]], [[Moabites]], and [[Ammonites]], who dominated the Canaanite inland areas around the Jordan Valley.

The Canaanites ({{lang-he|<U+05DB><U+05E0><U+05E2><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05DD> }}, [[Standard Hebrew]] ''Knaanim'', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] ''K<U+0259>na<U+2018>an<U+00EE>m'') are said to have been one of seven regional ethnic divisions or "nations" driven out before the [[Israelites]]. Specifically, the other nations include the [[Hittites in the Bible|Hittites]], the  [[Girgashites]], the [[Amorites]], the [[Perizzites]], the [[Hivites]], and the [[Jebusites]] ({{Niv|Deuteronomy|7:1|Deuteronomy 7:1}}).

The Bible describes God cautioning the Israelites against the sexual idolatry of the Canaanites and their [[fertility cult]] ({{Niv|Leviticus|18:27| Leviticus 18:27}}). Thus the Land of the Canaanites, as defined by these seven groups was deemed suitable for conquest by the Israelites partly on moral grounds ({{Niv|Deuteronomy|20:16-17| Deuteronomy 20:16<U+2013>17}}). One of the [[613 mitzvot]] (precisely n. 596) prescribes that no inhabitants of the cities of six Canaanite nations, the same as mentioned in 7:1, minus the Girgashites, were to be left alive.

==Phoenician Canaanites==
Early on the Canaanites acquired fame as traders across a wide area beyond the [[Near East]].  There are occasional instances in the Hebrew Bible where "Canaanite" is used as a synonym for "[[merchant]]" <U+2014> presumably indicating the aspect of Canaanite culture that the authors found most familiar. The term was derived from the place name, because so many merchants described themselves as Canaanites. 

One of Canaan's most famous exports was a much sought-after purple dye, derived from two species of [[Trunculus Murex|sea snails]] found along the east [[Mediterranean]] coast and worn proudly by figures from ancient kings to modern popes. 

Between ca. [[1200 BC|1200]]<U+2013>[[1100 BC]], most of southern Canaan was conquered by [[Ancient Israel|Israelites]], while the northern areas were taken over by [[Arameans]]. The remaining area still under clear Canaanite control, is referred to by its Greek name, "[[Phoenicia]]" (meaning "purple", in reference to the land's famous dye). 

Much later, in the [[6th century BC]], [[Hecataeus]] affirms that Phoenicia was formerly called '''<U+03C7><U+03BD><U+03B1>''', a name that [[Philo of Byblos]] subsequently adopted into his mythology as his eponym for the Phoenicians: "Khna who was afterwards called [[Phoenicians|Phoinix]]".  Quoting fragments attributed to [[Sanchuniathon]], he relates that [[Byblos]], [[Berytus]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] were among the first cities ever built, under the rule of the mythical [[Cronus]], and credits the inhabitants with developing fishing, hunting, agriculture, shipbuiding and writing.

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] also mentions that one of the terms the seafaring Phoenicians called their homeland was "Canaan." This is further confirmed by coins of the city of [[Latakia|Laodicea]] by the [[Lebanon]], that bear the legend, "Of Laodicea, a metropolis in Canaan"; these coins are dated to the reign of [[Antiochus IV of Syria|Antiochus IV]] ([[175 BC|175]]<U+2013>[[164 BC]]) and his successors. 

The first of many Canaanites who emigrated seaward finally settled in [[Carthage]], and St. Augustine adds that the country people near [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]], presumably [[Punic]] in origin, still called themselves ''Chanani'' in his day.

===Genetics===
{{Merge|Phoenicians|date=November 2006}}
<!-- The Phoenicians are the Canaanites proper.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} -->Genetic research using Y-chromosome haploid analysis has identified a Phoenician genetic marker (a so-to-speak "Canaanite gene") among modern Lebanese populations, including among Maronite Christians and Shiite Muslims, especially near the coast.<ref name = "Ph<U+0153>nicia">[http://www.phoenicia.org/genetics.html#Macedonians  Genetics] of Ph<U+0153>nicians.</ref> Initial findings evidence the modern Lebanese gene pools comprise indigenous Canaanites, followed by immigration waves from [[Arabs]], [[Crusade|Crusader Europeans]], and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]]. The [[American University of Beirut]] launched the Phoenician genographic project to precisely map the genetic makeup of the Lebanese population and even the Mediterranean populations where ancient Canaanites colonized. A high-frequency of the Canaanite gene has even been detected in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as well as in [[Malta]], an island that Phoenicians colonized.
