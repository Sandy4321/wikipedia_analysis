'''St. John's Lutheran Church (German Evangelical Lutheran Church)''' is a historic church in [[Isanti, Minnesota]], United States.  The church was built by German immigrants, who were among the earliest settlers in [[Isanti County, Minnesota]].  Although there were many more Swedish immigrants than Germans coming to the county, German settlers in the southeastern portion of [[Bradford Township, Isanti County, Minnesota|Bradford Township]] wanted their own church with services in their own language.  Church services were held in members' homes until the church was formally organized in 1882 and a building was built on donated land.<ref name="isanti">{{cite web|url=http://www.ichs.ws/st-johns-church.html|title=St. John's Church|publisher=Isanti County Historical Society|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>

The building is one story high, built in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival style]], with white [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] siding on the exterior.  The interior was heated with a simple wood stove at the back of the church, and lit with kerosene lamps and Coleman Quick-Lite chandeliers.  It also did not have running water or inside bathrooms.  The [[chancel]] and [[pulpit]] were donated by a church in [[Osseo, Minnesota]] that was doing its own renovations.  The community never had a congregation large enough to justify having a full-time pastor.  The church relied on lay people to do readings, as well as sharing a pastor with St. John's of [[Weber, Minnesota]].  Pastor F.J. Mack, who served from 1924 through 1945, began offering services in English and stopped offering services in German.  In 1959, the congregation decided to merge with St. John's of Weber after facing declining membership.<ref name="isanti"/>

In 1976, a restoration project saved the church from destruction, and around this time, the church and its grounds were deeded to the Isanti County Historical Society.  The church was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980, but not much was done with the building until 2004, when a group, The Friends of St. John's, was formed to support the renovation.  With the help of over 300 volunteers, major renovations were completed.  The building is now used for traditional German cultural programs, weddings, christenings, and memorial services.<ref name="isanti"/>
