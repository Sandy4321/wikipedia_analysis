Fort Lauderdale is named after a series of forts built by the [[United States]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. The forts took their name from Major William Lauderdale, who was the commander of the detachment of soldiers who built the first fort.<ref name=name/> However, development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned at the end of the conflict. Three forts named "Fort Lauderdale" were constructed; the first was at the fork of the [[New River (Broward County, Florida)|New River]], the second at Tarpon Bend, in what is now known as the Sailboat Bend neighborhood, and the third near the site of the Bahia Mar Marina.<ref name=name>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldfortlauderdale.org/history/preview.html |title=Old Fort Lauderdale Museum-Sneak Preview |publisher=Fort Lauderdale Historical Society |accessdate=2007-07-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704042340/http://www.oldfortlauderdale.org/history/preview.html |archivedate = July 4, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Fort Lauderdale, Florida}}

The area in which the city of Fort Lauderdale would later be founded was inhabited for more than a thousand years by the [[Tequesta]] Indians.<ref name=Hughes>{{Cite news |url=http://fulltext.fcla.edu//DLData/SN/SN01480340/0016_003/file5.pdf |title=Three Tequesta and Seminole hunting camps on the edge of the Everglades |last=Hughes |first=Kenneth J |periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission). |volume=16 |year=1993 |pages=31<U+2013>42 |accessdate=2007-07-01. |format=PDF |issue=3 and 4 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Contact with Spanish explorers in the 16th century proved disastrous for the Tequesta, as the Europeans unwittingly brought with them diseases to which the native populations possessed no resistance, such as smallpox. For the Tequesta, disease, coupled with continuing conflict with their [[Calusa]] neighbors, contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries.<ref name=McGoun>{{Cite news |url=http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/DLData/SN/SN01480340/0002_003/file66.pdf |title=A History of Broward County |last=McGoun |first=Bill |periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission) |year=1978 |volume=2 |pages=15<U+2013>22 |accessdate=2007-07-03|format=PDF |issue=3 and 4 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> By 1763, there were only a few Tequesta left in Florida, and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref name=Hughes /> Although control of the area changed between [[Spain]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and the [[Confederate States of America]], it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century.

The Fort Lauderdale area was known as the "New River Settlement" before the 20th century. In the 1830s there were approximately 70 settlers living along the New River. [[William Cooley]], the local [[Justice of the Peace]], was a farmer and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecker]], who traded with the [[Seminole Indians]]. On January 6, 1836, while Cooley was leading an attempt to salvage a wrecked ship, a band of Seminoles attacked his farm, killing his wife and children, and the children's [[tutor]]. The other farms in the settlement were not attacked, but all the white residents in the area abandoned the settlement, fleeing first to the [[Cape Florida Light]]house on [[Key Biscayne]], and then to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voneresearch.org/HistoryB.htm |title=Coastal History - The Seminole War Period |publisher=Vone Research |accessdate=2007-07-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928014231/http://www.voneresearch.org/HistoryB.htm |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

The first United States stockade named Fort Lauderdale was built in 1838,<ref name=fort>{{Cite news |url=http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/DLData/SN/SN01480340/0004_001/file29.pdf |title=Records in the Military Archives Division Which Relate to South Florida |last=Butler |first=Stuart |volume=4 |pages=11<U+2013>20 |year=1981 |periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission). |accessdate=2007-07-15. |format=PDF |issue=1 and 2 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> and subsequently was a site of fighting during the Second Seminole War. The fort was abandoned in 1842, after the end of the war, and the area remained virtually unpopulated until the 1890s. It was not until Frank Stranahan arrived in the area in 1893 to operate a ferry across the New River, and the [[Florida East Coast Railroad]]'s completion of a route through the area in 1896, that any organized development began. The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1911, and in 1915 was designated the county seat of newly formed [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]].<ref name=BrowardCreation>{{Cite news

After the war ended, service members returned to the area, spurring an enormous population explosion which dwarfed the 1920s boom.<ref name=McGoun/> The 1960 Census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 figure.<ref name=1960census>{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/11085788v1p11ch2.pdf |title=Census of Population:1960 Florida-Volume I Part 11 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |pages=11<U+2013>9 |accessdate=2007-07-01|format=PDF}}</ref> A 1967 report estimated that the city was approximately 85% developed,<ref name=george>{{Cite news |url=http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/DLData/SN/SN01480340/0014_003/file4.pdf |title=Downtown Fort Lauderdale: Its Demise and Renaissance in the Post-War Era |last=George |first=Paul S. |periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission) |year=1991 |volume=14 |pages=9<U+2013>19 |accessdate=2007-07-17 |format=PDF |issue=3 and 4 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> and the 1970 population figure was 139,590.<ref name=1970census>{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_fl1-01.pdf |title=1970 Census of Population |publisher=United States Census Bureau |pages=11<U+2013>12 |accessdate=2007-07-01 |format=PDF}}</ref>

The northwestern section of Fort Lauderdale is separate from the remainder of the city, connected only by the Cypress Creek Canal as it flows under I-95. This section of Fort Lauderdale borders the cities of Tamarac and Oakland Park on its south side. Oakland Park also borders Fort Lauderdale on the west side of its northeastern portion. The greater portion of Fort Lauderdale in the south is bordered, along its north side by Wilton Manors.

Off the coast of Fort Lauderdale is the [[Osborne Reef]], an [[artificial reef]] made of discarded tires that has proven to be an ecological disaster.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17189132/ | title=Tire reef off Florida proves a disaster | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=February 16, 2007 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.<ref name=enn>{{cite web |url=http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=13101&ref=rss |title=Florida Raises Ill-Fated Artificial Reefs |author=Loney, Jim |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref>

=== Neighborhoods ===
{{See also|List of neighborhoods in Fort Lauderdale}}

Fort Lauderdale, unlike many cities, has an official program for designating and recognizing neighborhoods. Under the Neighborhood Organization Recognition Program,<ref name=norp>{{cite web

  |title=Neighborhood Organization Recognition Program
  |publisher=City of Fort Lauderdale
  |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref> more than 60 distinct neighborhoods have received official recognition from the city. An additional 25<U+2013>30 neighborhoods exist without official recognition, although the city's neighborhood map displays them as well.<ref>{{cite web

=== Climate ===
[[File:Fort Lauderdale beach night.jpeg|right|thumb|Sunrise at Fort Lauderdale Beach]]

Despite the fact that it is both far removed from the [[equator]] and located just outside the [[tropics]], Fort Lauderdale features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') <ref>{{cite web
  | url=http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/Koppen/North_America.jpg
  | title=K<U+00F6>ppen<U+2212>Geiger Climate Classification Map of North America}}</ref> with little seasonal variation in temperature. Typically, tropical rainforest climates are found near the equator, but Fort Lauderdale is an exceptional case. Average monthly temperatures are always above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} and average monthly precipitation is above {{convert|60|mm|in|2}}.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/fitness/wxclimatology/monthly/USFL0149 Monthly Averages for Fort Lauderdale, FL]</ref><ref>[http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/kottek_et_al_2006_A1.pdf World Map of K<U+00F6>ppen-Geiger Climate Classification]</ref> This qualifies the city's climate as a tropical rainforest climate, as the city does not have a true [[dry season]]. While significant rain does fall in winter, the majority of precipitation is received during the summer months (see climate chart below). 

Summers ("wet season") from May through October are hot, humid, and wet with average high temperatures of {{convert|86|-|90|F|C|0}} and lows of {{convert|71|-|76|F|C|0}}. During this period, more than half of summer days may bring afternoon or evening thunderstorms.<ref name="weatherbase.com">http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=048537&refer=</ref>

Winter ("dry season") from November through April are warm and mostly dry with average high temperatures of {{convert|75|-|82|F|C|0}} and lows of {{convert|59|-|67|F|C|0}}. However, the city experiences occasional cold fronts during this period, bringing high temperatures in the 60s <U+00B0>F (16-21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) and lows in the 40s <U+00B0>F (4-10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), lasting only for a few days.<ref name="weatherbase.com"/> Temperatures very rarely fall any lower than {{convert|40|F|1}}. Like Miami further to the south, rare freezes do occur which are devastating to the tropical plants.   Fort Lauderdale has on very rare occasions recorded snow flurries.  The last snow was on January 19, 1977 with a trace being reported.<ref>South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, FL)  Article date: January 19, 2007</ref>

Annual average precipitation is {{convert|64.2|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, with most of it occurring during the wet season from May through October. However, rainfall occurs in all months, mainly as short-lived heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Fort Lauderdale has an average of 143 precipitation days and 250 sunshine days annually. The [[hurricane season]] is between June 1 and November 30 with major hurricanes most likely to affect Florida in September and October.<ref name=major>{{cite web
