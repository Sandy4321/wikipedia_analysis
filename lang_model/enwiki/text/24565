'''M-11''' is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the US state of Michigan in the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] metropolitan area. The highway runs through the western and southern sides of the metro area, starting over the border in [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]] at an interchange with [[Interstate 96]] (I-96). It runs through both rural woodlands and busy commercial areas before it terminates at another interchange with I-96 in [[Cascade Township, Michigan|Cascade Township]]. Locally known as Wilson Avenue and 28th Street, the trunkline is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], M-11 carries between 8,000 and 42,000&nbsp;vehicles on average each day.

When the original state trunklines were designated, an M-11 ran the length of the [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline from the Indiana state line to [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]]. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created [[United States Numbered Highways|US Highways]]. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the [[Saline, Michigan|Saline]] area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US Highway 16]] (US&nbsp;16) in Michigan.

==Route description==
The western terminus is at exit&nbsp;24 on I-96, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) east of [[Marne, Michigan|Marne]]. In Ottawa County, the road is called Ironwood Drive. Beginning at the [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]] border, the street is called Remembrance Road (in honor of those who died in battle). From its western terminus, the road angles southeast<U+2013>northwest for about a mile and a half (2.4&nbsp;km). Then M-11 turns south on Wilson Avenue to run north<U+2013>south through Walker. Wilson Avenue intersects [[M-45 (Michigan highway)|M-45]] (Lake Michigan Drive) in the Standale Business District. South of Lake Michigan Drive, the trunkline continues on Wilson Avenue through the edge of a rural area. The highway runs through forest land near [[Millennium_Park_(Grand_Rapids)|Millennium Park]] until it crosses the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] at [[Interstate 196|I-196]].<ref name=MDOT11/><ref name=UGR/><ref name=google/>

[[File:28th & East Beltline.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Intersection of 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue in Kentwood looking southwest]]
Past I-196, M-11 curves to run east<U+2013>west and becomes 28th Street. Wilson continues southwards as a local road and 28th Street is the route through [[Grandville, Michigan|Grandville]] and [[Wyoming, Michigan|Wyoming]]. [[Chicago Drive]] runs under 28th Street in Grandville; there is a ramp from eastbound Chicago Drive to eastbound 28th Street, but all other connections are through the "28th Street Cutoff" to the east of the [[grade-separated]] junction. Continuing eastward through Wyoming, M-11 passes through that city's central business district. The highway intersects [[U.S. Route 131|US Highway 131]] and crosses into [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] at Division Avenue. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, 28th Street passes the Indian Hills Golf Course. From Breton Avenue eastward, 28th Street is dominated by retail establishments as it continues into [[Kentwood, Michigan|Kentwood]]. M-11 meets an intersection with East Beltline Avenue near the [[Woodland Mall]]. East Beltline carries [[M-37 (Michigan highway)|M-37]] through the eastern side of the Grand Rapids metro area, and [[M-44 (Michigan highway)|M-44]] north of 28th Street.  M-11 continues eastward to its terminus at exit&nbsp;44 on I-96 while 28th Street continues farther east to Cascade Road.<ref name="MDOT11">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=State Transportation Map |year=2011 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |cartography=MDOT |inset= Grand Rapids}}</ref><ref name=UGR>{{cite map |publisher=[[Universal Map]] |cartography= Universal Map |title=Grand Rapids Greater Area Street Map |year=2010 |section=F7<U+2013>F13, F13<U+2013>P13 |isbn=0-7625-5247-6}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=M-11+E%2FIronwood+Dr+NW&daddr=43.01278,-85.78278+to:42.91359,-85.7484+to:M-11+W%2F28th+St+SE&hl=en&sll=43.012179,-85.6707&sspn=0.483502,0.465546&geocode=FWySkAId6Lfi-g%3BFaxSkAIdBA_j-ilPdRAu56UZiDFBiHUli8W08A%3BFTbPjgIdUJXj-ikPouL6aLAZiDEaCOkJJpK9Tw%3BFe7LjgIddsbm-g&vpsrc=0&mra=dpe&mrsp=2&sz=11&via=1,2&t=h&z=11 |title= Overview Map of M-11 |accessdate= August 27, 2011}}</ref>

M-11 is maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called [[annual average daily traffic]], which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-11 were the 41,214&nbsp;vehicles daily between Kalamazoo and Breton avenues in Grand Rapids; the lowest counts were the 8,153&nbsp;vehicles per day in Ottawa County.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author= Bureau of Transportation Planning<U+200E> |url=http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |date=2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> All of M-11 has been listed on the National Highway System,<ref name=NHS-BCMI>{{cite map |title=National Highway System: Grand Rapids Urbanized Area |year= 2005 |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Grand_Rapids_150613_7.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}</ref> a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |first= Kevin |last= Adderly |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/ |title= The National Highway System |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date= August 26, 2010 |accessdate= January 1, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
===Previous designations===
The first M-11 originally ran along Lake Michigan between the Indiana state line near [[New Buffalo, Michigan|New Buffalo]] and Mackinaw City on July 1, 1919.<ref name=MSHD19LP>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=State of Michigan: Lower Peninsula |date= July 1, 1919 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> On November 11, 1926, the New Buffalo<U+2013>[[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]] segment was used for [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] and the Watervliet<U+2013>Mackinaw City section was used for [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]]; between Benton Harbor and Watervliet, M-11 was used for a [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] US&nbsp;12/US&nbsp;31.<ref name="USH">{{cite map| publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=United States System of Highways |url=http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/misc-maps/1926us.pdf |date= November 11, 1926 |accessdate=May 10, 2008 |format=PDF}}</ref> Streets are still designated as Old M-11 in places such as [[Chikaming Township, Michigan|Chikaming Township]].<ref>{{cite map |cartography= BCRC |url= http://www.bcroad.org/Chikaming.pdf |format= PDF |title= Chikaming Township |accessdate= August 27, 2011  |date= January 2011 |publisher=[[Berrien County, Michigan|Berrien County]] Road Commission |section=10, T7S R20W |scale= 1&nbsp;in:2000&nbsp;ft  }}</ref>

Immediately after the debut of the [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highway System]] in 1926, M-11 was designated from [[M-50 (Michigan highway)|M-50]] at [[Napoleon, Michigan|Napoleon]] to [[U.S. Route 112|US&nbsp;112]] in Saline.<ref name=MSHD26-12>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=December 1, 1926 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> The last section of this highway was fully paved between [[Bridgewater, Michigan|Bridgewater]] and Saline in late 1948 or early 1949.<ref name=MSHD48-07>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1948 Official Highway Map |year=July 1, 1948 |section= M12}}</ref><ref name=MSHD49-04>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Michigan Official Highway Map |year=April 15, 1949 |section= M12}}</ref> In the middle of 1954, [[M-92 (Michigan highway)|M-92]] was extended southward from [[Chelsea, Michigan|Chelsea]] to [[Manchester, Michigan|Manchester]]. From there, that highway replaced M-11 west to Bridgewater before turning south to [[Clinton, Michigan|Clinton]]; at the same time, the remainder of M-11 was removed from the state highway system and the designation was decommissioned.<ref name=MSHD54-04>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1954 Official Highway Map |year=April 15, 1954 |section=M12}}</ref><ref name=MSHD54-10>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1954 Official Highway Map |year=October 1, 1954 |section=M12}}</ref>

===Memorial designations===
The current M-11 follows Remembrance Road, Wilson Avenue and 28th Street. The first two of these names were chosen to memorialize the roadway in honor of local people. Remembrance Road was dedicated in 1923 on the initiative of the local chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. They planted 231&nbsp;[[elm]]s in a double row on each side of the highway and erected a boulder bearing a bronze plaque dedicated to the veterans of Kent County. Wilson Avenue was named for Samuel H. Wilson, a local realtor. He had developed a series of local residential subdivisions in the area up until his 1931 death, In 1942, the county road commission named Wilson Avenue in his honor to comply with a state law requiring roads that benefitted from state funds to have proper names.<ref name=barnett>{{cite book |last= Barnett |first= LeRoy |year= 2004 |title= A Drive Down Memory Lane: The Named State and Federal Highways of Michigan |location= Allegan Forest, MI |publisher= Priscilla Press |pages=185, 242 |isbn= 1-886167-24-9}}</ref>
