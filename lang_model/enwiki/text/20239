Her paternal great-grandfather, Bogi<U+0107> Cami<U+0107> Jovovi<U+0107>, was a flag-bearer of the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin Serb]] [[Vasojevi<U+0107>i]] clan and an officer in the guard of the King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]]; his wife's name was Milica.

He was punished for refusing to convict a friend of the crime. Later, the [[communist]] government imprisoned him in [[Goli Otok]]. When he feared that he could be [[arrest]]ed again, he escaped to [[Albania]] and later moved to [[Kiev]]. A different   version of the story claims that he was the one who took the gold.

[[Image:Resident Evil Milla.jpg|thumb|225px|Jovovich, in a scene from ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'', in which she battles a [[Licker]].]]
In 2002, Jovovich starred in the horror/action film ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'', released in the United States on [[March 15]], [[2002]]. Based on the [[Capcom|CAPCOM]] video game series of [[Resident Evil|same name]], she portrayed [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], the film's heroine who fights a legion of [[zombies]] created by the evil [[Umbrella Corporation]]. Jovovich had accepted the role of Alice because she and her brother had been fans of the video game franchise, saying "it was exciting for me just watching him play, I could sit for 5 hours and we would sit all day and play this game".<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil (2002)| publisher= millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/film/resident.shtml| accessdate= 2007-10-20}}</ref> Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, save for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, in which her management deemed too dangerous,<ref>''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' DVD commentary (2002)</ref> and had trained in karate, kick-boxing and combat-training.<ref>{{citation| last= Bradberry| first= Grace| title= Modern Milla| magazine= [[In Style|In Style (UK)]]| year= 2002| date= July 2002| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/instyleuk0702.shtml| accessdate= 2007-12-29}}</ref> The film was commercially successful, grossing [[USD|$]]17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining [[USD|$]]40 million domestically and [[USD|$]]102 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil| publisher= [[Box Office Mojo]]| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevil.htm| accessdate= 2007-10-20}}</ref> Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in ''[[No Good Deed]]'' (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy ''[[You Stupid Man]]'' (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in ''[[Dummy (film)|Dummy]]'' (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series ''[[King of the Hill]]''. The role of Fangora in ''Dummy'', allowed Jovovich to act in film with [[Oscar Award|Oscar]]-winning [[Adrien Brody]], who was a friend prior to filming.

In 2004, Jovovich reprised the role of Alice in the sequel to ''Resident Evil'', ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''.

Following the release of the film, Jovovich was unhappy with the results and director [[Alexander Witt]]'s effort.<ref name="punk"/> he noted during an interview that year that her large action films take care of the commercial part of her career, while she acts in "independent little films that never come out" to appease her artistic side, and "It's a good balance".<ref name="Leeloo"/> The following year, she was featured in [[Gore Vidal]]'s faux trailer remake of ''[[Caligula]]'', as [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]]. In 2006, Jovovich's film, the [[science fiction]]/action thriller ''[[Ultraviolet (film)|Ultraviolet]]'', was released on [[March 3]]. She played the title role of [[Violet Song jat Shariff]], a role that also involved heavily choreographed fight sequences and [[Gun Kata]], a fictional martial art combining statistical analysis and gunplay. It was not screened for critics, but when reviewed, it was critically panned,<ref name="Tomatoes">{{cite web | title= Ultraviolet| publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10004504-ultraviolet/ | accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> grossing [[USD|$]]31 million world wide.<ref>{{cite web | title= Ultraviolet| publisher= [[Box Office Mojo]]| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ultraviolet.htm| accessdate= 2007-12-28}}</ref> That year Jovovich also starred in ''[[.45 (film)|.45]]'', as Kat, the revenge driven wife of a drug dealer.

== Music career ==
[[Image:Milladivinecomedy.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of Jovovich's debut album, ''[[The Divine Comedy (album)|The Divine Comedy]]''.]]
Jovovich had begun working on a music album as early as 1988, when she was signed by [[SBK Records]] after the company heard a demo she recorded.<ref name="music">{{cite web| title= Milla's Music| publisher= millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/tdc.shtml| accessdate= 2007-11-02}}</ref> In August 1990, she asserted in an interview that the then-forthcoming album would be "a mix between [[Kate Bush]], [[Sinead O'Connor]], [[This Mortal Coil]] and the [[Cocteau Twins]]."<ref>{{citation| title= Milla| magazine= [[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone (Australia)]] | year= 1990| date= August 1990| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/rs890.shtml| accessdate= 2007-11-02}}</ref> After it was initially presented by SBK strictly as a [[pop music|pop]] album, Jovovich protested, insisting on using her personal poetry for lyrics and recording her own instrumental material.<ref name="music"/> Jovovich had written the songs when she was fifteen, with the exception of a Ukrainian folk song, "In a Glade", that she covered. In April 1994, billed under her first name, she released ''[[The Divine Comedy (album)|The Divine Comedy]]'', a title that was a reference to the [[epic poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]] of the [[The Divine Comedy|same name]]. Jovovich had chosen the title after seeing Russian artist Alexis Steele's proposed cover artwork sketch for the then untitled album. Jovovich found that the sketch had "all the struggle that I'm singing about. It IS the divine comedy".<ref name="music"/> ''The Divine Comedy'' was well received by critics, and featured pop-infused traditional Ukrainian folk songs that led to comparisons with musicians [[Tori Amos]] and Kate Bush.<ref name="Wang"/> John McAlley of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "remarkable", "strikingly mature and rich in invention" and as featuring "angst-laced poetry with vivid melodies and arrangements that find a common spirit in synth pop, European folk and psychedelic dream rock".<ref>{{citation| last= McAlley| first= John| title= The Divine Comedy| magazine= [[Rolling Stone]]| year= 1994| date= April 1994| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/rsreview.shtml| accessdate= 2007-11-02}}</ref> Jovovich released the track "Gentleman Who Fell", with an accompanying [[music video]], as the sole single from the album. She originally filmed video directed by [[Lisa Bonet]] and featuring [[Harry Dean Stanton]], but was unsatisfied with the results and decided to film another version. The second version of "Gentleman Who Fell", a homage to [[Maya Deren]]'s short film ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), was subsequently played on [[MTV]]. Jovovich toured the [[United States]] during most of 1994 to promote the album, opening for [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] and [[Crash Test Dummies]], as well as playing smaller acoustic sets. Jovovich had opted to perform in smaller and more intimate settings, turning down a musical appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name="Oxymoron"/> Following ''The Divine Comedy'', she expressed interest in releasing a second album, having had ten songs ready for a future recording that was intended for a Summer 1996 release.<ref name="cafe"/><ref name="Europe"/> However, Jovovich has yet to release a second album.

1998 saw the release of ''[[The Peopletree Sessions]]'', a recording unauthorized by Jovovich that "she does not stand behind ... in any way, shape or form."<ref name="People Tree">{{cite web| last= Brenner| first= Chris| title= Message by CHRIS| publisher= millanews.com| url= http://www.millanews.com/milla/divinemilla/peopletree.html| accessdate= 2007-12-27}}</ref> She had met ''The Peopletree Sessions'' producer [[David Turin]] through his wife, fashion photographer [[Kate Garner]] who had shot Jovovich for various magazines. Turnin had approached Jovovich to collaborate on songs with [[Perry Farrell]], [[Steven Perkins]], and producer duo the [[Dust Brothers]], and she agreed, then recording music with Turnin. Afterwards, Jovovich received a CD from Turnin of 13 tracks, with cover art photographed by Garner, which Jovovich assumed to be for her own personal use. Turnin then released the album as Jovovich's second album, to which Jovovich attempted to stop the sale of. She has taken legal action against Turnin and Garner.<ref name="People Tree"/>

Jovovich has contributed tracks to several of her film soundtracks, as well as providing songs for film soundtracks in which she has not acted, including the soundtracks for ''The Million Dollar Hotel'' (2000), ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' (2003), and ''Dummy'' (2003) in the latter category. In 2001, Jovovich was one of many celebrities whose vocals were featured in a cover of "We are Family" to raise money for the [[American Red Cross]]. She has appeared as guest vocalist on the song "Former Lover" on [[Deepak Chopra]]'s album, ''A Gift of Love II: Oceans of Ecstasy'' (2002) and ''[[Legion of Boom]]'' (2004) by [[The Crystal Method]].
