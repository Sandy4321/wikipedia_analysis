'''''Cucurbita''''' ([[Latin]] for [[gourd]])<ref name="burrows" /> is a [[genus]] of [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[vine]] in the gourd [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cucurbitaceae]], also known as cucurbits, native to the [[Andes]] and [[Mesoamerica]]. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as '''squash''',<!--REDIRECT TARGET from "Squash plant"--> [[pumpkin]], or gourd depending on species, [[Variety (botany)|variety]], and local parlance,{{efn|Due to wide variation in how the terms squash, pumpkin, and gourd are used, even among academics, in this article, the term squash can refer to any member of the genus ''Cucurbita''. Pumpkin and gourd are used to refer to species, varieties, and cultivars commonly referred to by those terms.<ref name="Ferriol">{{cite book |last1=Ferriol |first1=Mar<U+00ED>a |last2=Pic<U+00F3> |first2=Bel<U+00E9>n |year=2007 |title=Handbook of Plant Breeding: Vegetables I |publisher=Springer |location=New York |chapter=3 |isbn=978-0-387-72291-7 |page=317 |quote=The common terms <U+201C>pumpkin<U+201D>, <U+201C>squash<U+201D>, <U+201C>gourd<U+201D>, <U+201C>cushaw<U+201D>, <U+201C>ayote<U+201D>, <U+201C>zapallo<U+201D>, <U+201C>calabaza<U+201D>, etc. are often applied indiscriminately to different cultivated species of the New World genus ''Cucurbita'' L. (Cucurbitaceae): ''C.&nbsp;pepo'' L., ''C.&nbsp; maxima'' Duchesne, ''C.&nbsp;moschata'' Duchesne, ''C.&nbsp;argyrosperma'' C.&nbsp;Huber and ''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'' Bouch<U+00E9>.}}</ref>}} and seeds. First cultivated in the Americas before being brought to Europe after the discovery of the New World, plants in the genus ''Cucurbita'' are important sources of human food, beverages, medicine, and oil. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus ''[[Lagenaria]]'', which is in the same family and subfamily as ''Cucurbita'' but in a different [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]]. These gourds are used as utensils or vessels.

Most ''Cucurbita'' species are herbaceous vines that grow several meters in length and have [[tendril]]s, but non-vining "bush" cultivars of ''C.&nbsp;pepo'' and ''C.&nbsp;maxima'' have also been developed. The yellow or orange flowers on a ''Cucurbita'' plant are of two types: female and male. The female flowers produce the fruit and the male flowers produce [[pollen]]. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist [[Apidae|bee]] [[pollinator]]s, but other insects with more general feeding habits such as [[honey bee]]s also visit. The fruits of the ''Cucurbita'' genus are good sources of several nutrients such as [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[niacin]], [[folic acid]], and [[iron]], and like all plant products are free of [[cholesterol]]. The plants contain the toxins [[cucurbitin]], [[cucurmosin]], and [[cucurbitacin]]. There is some disagreement about how to handle the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the genus; the number of species accepted by different specialists varies from 13 to 30. In addition, the ancestry of some of the species that have been cultivated for millennia is uncertain. The five [[Domestication#Plants|domesticated]] species are ''[[Cucurbita argyrosperma]]'', ''[[Cucurbita ficifolia|C.&nbsp;ficifolia]]'', ''[[Cucurbita maxima|C.&nbsp;maxima]]'', ''[[Cucurbita moschata|C.&nbsp;moschata]]'', and ''[[Cucurbita pepo|C.&nbsp;pepo]]''. All of these can be treated as [[winter squash]] because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, ''C.&nbsp;pepo'' includes some [[cultivar]]s that are better used only as [[summer squash]]. 

''Cucurbita'' fruits have played a role in human culture for at least 2,000 years. They are often represented in [[Moche culture|Moche]] ceramics from Peru. After [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in the New World, paintings of squashes started to appear in Europe early in the sixteenth century. Among other uses, ''Cucurbita'' seeds have been employed in [[traditional medicine]], and extracts are used in [[cosmetics]] for dry and sensitive skin. The fruits have many culinary uses including [[pumpkin pie]], biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, and soups. Pumpkins and other ''Cucurbita'' fruits are celebrated in festivals and in flower and vegetable shows in many countries.

Most ''Cucurbita'' species are climbing [[annual plant|annual]] vines; they are also [[mesophyte]]s, plants which require a more or less continuous water supply. The less numerous [[perennial plant|perennial species]] grow in tropical zones and are [[xerophyte]]s, plants which tolerate dry conditions. Growing {{convert|5|to|15|m|ft|sp=us}} in height or length, the plant stem produces [[tendril]]s to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is ''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'', and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial ''Cucurbita'' can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among ''Cucurbita'' fruits, and even within a single species. ''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'' is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance.<ref name="nee">{{cite jstor|4255271}}</ref> The [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] variation in the species ''C.&nbsp;pepo''<ref name="deckerwalters">{{cite jstor|3093892}}</ref> and ''C.&nbsp;maxima''<ref name="maximadiffspecies">{{cite journal|last=Mill<U+00E1>n|first=R.|title= Variaciones del Zapallito Amargo ''Cucurbita andreana'' y el Origen de ''Cucurbita maxima''|journal=Revista Argentina de Agronom<U+00ED>a|year=1945|volume= 12|pages=86<U+2013>93|language=Spanish}}</ref> is so vast that its various [[subspecies]] and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.<ref name="deckerwalters" />

[[File:Cucurbita moschata leaves.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Green ''Cucurbita moschata'' leaves with white spots|The leaves of ''[[Cucurbita moschata]]'' often have white spots near the veins.]]
The typical cultivated ''Cucurbita'' species has five-lobed or [[Leaf shape|palmately divided]] leaves with long [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]], with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with various types of [[trichome]]s, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each [[Plant stem|node]] and are branching in some species. ''C.&nbsp;argyrosperma'' has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of ''C.&nbsp;pepo'' leaves varies widely. ''C.&nbsp;moschata'' plants can have light or dense [[Leaf#Surface|pubescence]]. ''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'' leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species may or may not have white spots.<ref name="saade" />

There are male ([[stamen|staminate]]) and female ([[pistil]]late) flowers (unisexual flowers) on a single plant ([[monoecious]]), and these grow singly, appearing from the [[Axillary bud|leaf axils]]. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the [[petal#Corolla|corolla]]) and a green bell-shaped [[Sepal|calyx]]. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in ''Cucurbita'' there are only three, and their [[anther]]s are joined together so that there appears to be one.<ref name="Mabberley">{{cite book |last=Mabberley |first=D.

''Cucurbita'' fruits are large and fleshy.<ref name=Mabberley/> Botanists classify the ''Cucurbita'' fruit as a [[Berry|pepo]], which is a special type of berry derived from an inferior ovary, with a thick outer wall or rind with [[hypanthium]] tissue forming an [[exocarp]] around the ovary, and a fleshy interior composed of [[mesocarp]] and [[endocarp]]. The term "pepo" is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits, where this fruit type is common, but the fruits of ''[[Passiflora]]'' and ''[[Carica]]'' are sometimes also considered pepos.<ref name="hypanthium">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbotanical.com/fruit_types.htm |title=A Systematic Treatment of Fruit Types |publisher=Worldbotanical |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="schrager">{{cite book |last=Schrager|first=Victor |title=The Compleat Squash: A Passionate Grower's Guide to Pumpkins, Squash, and Gourds |publisher=Artisan |location=New York |year=2004 |page=25 |isbn=978-1-579-65251-7}}</ref> The seeds, which are attached to the ovary wall (parietal placentation) and not to the center, are large and fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two [[cotyledon]]s.<ref name="ucla" /> Fruit size varies considerably: wild fruit specimens can be as small as {{convert|4|cm|in|sp=us}} and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over {{convert|300|kg|lb|sp=us}}.<ref name="saade" /> The current world record was set in October 2014 by John Hawkley of [[Napa County, California]] with a {{convert|933.5|kg|lb|sp=us|adj=on}} pumpkin.<ref name="appumpkin">{{cite news |title=OH GOURD!

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:2009 Circleville Pumpkin Show champions.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Very large orange pumpkins| A festival-winning {{convert|742|kg|lb|sp=us}} pumpkin in 2009]]

Archaeological investigations have found evidence of domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America.<ref name="nee" /> Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, ''C.&nbsp;argyrosperma'', ''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'', ''C.&nbsp;moschata'', and ''C.&nbsp;pepo'', originated and were domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]]; for the fifth, ''C.&nbsp;maxima'', these events occurred in South America.<ref name="saade">{{cite web |last1=Saade |first1=R. Lira |last2=Hern<U+00E1>ndez |first2=S. Montes |title=Cucurbits |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/1492/cucurbits.html |publisher=Purdue Horticulture |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref>

Within ''C.&nbsp;pepo'', the pumpkins, the scallops, and possibly the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of ''C.&nbsp;pepo'' have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number.<ref name="paris1989" /> In a 1989 study on the origins and development of ''C.&nbsp;pepo'', botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.<ref name="paris1989" />

[[File:Cucurbita moschata Butternut 2012 G2.jpg|thumb|alt=Sliced butternut squash|''C.&nbsp;moschata'' 'Butternut']]
''C.&nbsp;argyrosperma'' is not as widespread as the other species. The wild form ''C. a.'' subsp. ''sororia'' is found from [[Mexico]] to [[Nicaragua]], and cultivated forms are used in a somewhat wider area stretching from Panama to the southeastern United States.<ref name="saade" /> It was probably bred for its seeds, which are large and high in [[Oil#Organic oils|oil]] and [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]], but its flesh is of poorer quality than that of ''C.&nbsp;moschata'' and ''C.&nbsp;pepo''. It is grown in a wide altitudinal range: from sea level to as high as {{convert|1800|m|ft|sp=us}} in dry areas, usually with the use of irrigation, or in areas with a defined rainy season, where seeds are sown in May and June.<ref name="saade" />

''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'' and ''C.&nbsp;moschata'' were originally thought to be Asiatic in origin, but this has been disproven. The origin of ''C.&nbsp;ficifolia'' is Latin America, most likely southern Mexico, Central America, or the Andes. It grows at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} to {{convert|3000|m|ft|sp=us}} in areas with heavy rainfall. It does not hybridize well with the other cultivated species as it has significantly different enzymes and chromosomes.<ref name="saade" />

''C.&nbsp;maxima'' originated in South America over 4,000 years ago,<ref name="sanjur" /> probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants are sensitive to [[Frost#Effect on plants|frost]], and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.<ref name="uwis">{{cite web |title=''Cucurbita maxima'' Origin/ Habitat |url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/herman_jaci/habitat_geography.htm |publisher=University of Wisconsin |year=2007 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref> ''C.&nbsp;maxima'' did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus.
