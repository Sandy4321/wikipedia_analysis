'''Armenia-Azerbaijan relations in the Eurovision Song Contest''' has been hostile at best since both countries entered in 2006 (Armenia) and 2008 (Azerbaijan) with the countries not voting for each other and other issues, because of the current still ongoing conflict over the area called [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] which is under Armenian military control since 1993. The countries relations became world headline news in 2009 when a series of controversies between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] unfolded throughout the semi-finals and final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]]. 

== 2006 Azeri complaint ==
In 2006 when Armenia send its first entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]], Azerbaijani mass-media complained that the official website of the Eurovision song contest showed the first [[Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Armenian]] representative [[Andr<U+00E9> (singer)|Andr<U+00E9>]]'s place of birth as "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]", despite the latter being ''[[de jure]]'' part of [[Azerbaijan]] and unquestionably so at the time of Andr<U+00E9>'s birth in 1979. As a result, the "Place of Birth" section was removed at once from the singer's profile.<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://www.day.az/news/showbiz/43927.html Abulfaz Garayev: Eurovision Governing Body Fixed Error on Website]</ref>

== Azeri bribes allegations==
After the finish of Eurovision 2009, some [[Telecommunications in Belarus#Media|Belarusian media]] reported that unknown people had allegedly paid and bribed students from [[Belarus]] to vote for Azerbaijan in the contest, and had even transported them to the Belarusian-Lithuanian border in 10 buses. The cost of this alleged action was claimed to be about 55 million [[Belarusian ruble|rubles]].<ref name="belradio.fm">[http://www.belradio.fm/en/854/reports/32828/ Did Azerbaijan "bribe" Belarus and Lithuania to vote at "Eurovision"? // European Radio for Belarus, by Zm<U+0456>tser Panyamonau, Hanna Balahov<U+0456>ch. 2009-05-19]</ref> They purportedly voted for Azerbaijan using Belarusian [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM cards]], and then received [[Lithuania]]n cards to repeat the process. The Azerbaijani entry "Always" received high votes from Belarus (10) and Lithuania (5), being even ahead of [[Russia]] in Belarus. The head of the Azerbaijani diaspora in Belarus, Natik Baghirov, said that he knew nothing about the action, and the member of the Belarusian "Eurovision" jury Syarhei Malinouski doubted that the trip to the Belarusian border took place, calling it a "stupid rumor". However, European Radio for Belarus had an unofficial confirmation from the Minsk auto parks.<ref name="belradio.fm"/><ref>[http://www.belaruspartisan.org/bp-forte/?page=100&backPage=6&news=40404&newsPage=0 <U+0410><U+0437><U+0435><U+0440><U+0431><U+0430><U+0439><U+0434><U+0436><U+0430><U+043D> "<U+043F><U+043E><U+0434><U+043A><U+0443><U+043F><U+0430><U+043B>" <U+0433><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0441><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> "<U+0415><U+0432><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438>" <U+0432> <U+0411><U+0435><U+043B><U+0430><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0438> <U+0438> <U+041B><U+0438><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435>?
