{{History of war}}
'''Network-centric warfare''' (NCW), or '''Network-centric operations''' (NCO), is a new [[military doctrine]] pioneered by the [[United States military|United States]]. It aims to exploit technical advances in [[information technology]] and [[telecommunications]] to improve [[situational awareness]] and the speed of decision-making.

[[Network Enabled Capability]] (NEC) is a term used in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere for a similar doctrine.

== Background and history ==
The doctrine of network-centric warfare for the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] draws upon the work of many military strategists and policy theorists, including that of [[Thomas Barnett]] at the [[Naval War College|US Naval War College]] and Vice-Admiral [[Arthur K. Cebrowski|Arthur Cebrowski]] and [[John J. Garstka]] of the [[Office of Force Transformation]] in the [[United States Department of Defense]] (US DoD).

See [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] for further information.

== Vision == 
The vision for NCW/NCO is to exploit the power of networking and information sharing in to improve operational effectiveness.

Tenets of Network Centric Operations:

* A Robustly Networked Force Improves Information Sharing
* Information Sharing And Collaboration Enhances the Quality of Information and Shared Situational Awareness
* Shared Situational Awareness Enables Collaboration and Self Synchronization and Enhances Sustainability and Speed of Command
* These in Turn Dramatically Increase Mission Effectiveness

Neworking has the potential to provide significantly improved access to timely and relevant information to all warfighters and decision-makers at every echelon in the military hierarchy.  A goal of improved networking is to provide ubiquitous connectivity throughout the organization, including individual infantry soldiers and ground vehicles, command centers, aircraft and naval vessels, and spacecraft.  This improved networking has the potential to enable all elements to share  information collected to be combined into a coherent, accurate picture of the battlefield, which is made available to all units. Every unit "sees" the sum of what all other units "see" and thus enjoy a greatly increased [[situation awareness]].  Evidence from ongoing military operatoins has demonstrated that having rapid access to reliable situational awareness and a relevant [[Common Operational Picture|common operational picture]] will result in improved planning and more effective tactical decisions.

== Related technologies and programs ==
The US DoD has mandated that the [[Global Information Grid]] (GIG) will be the 
primary technical framework to support NCW/NCO.  Under this directive, all 
advanced [[weapons platform|weapons platforms]], [[sensor|sensor systems]], and [[command and control|command and control centers]] are eventually to be linked
via the GIG.  The term [[system of systems]] is often used to descrbe the 
results of these types of massive integration efforts.  

The topic [[Net-Centric Enterprise Services]] addresses the applications context
of the GIG.

A number of significant U.S. military programs are taking technical steps towards supporting network-centric warfare.  These include the 
[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/cec.htm Cooperative Engagement 
Capability (CEC)] of the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Future Combat 
Systems]] (FCS) program in the [[United States Army]].

== Doctrinal tenets of network-centric warfare ==
The doctrine of NCW for the United States armed forces draws its highest level of guidance from the concept of "team warfare", meaning the integration and synchronization of all appropriate capabilities across the various services, ranging from Army to Air Force to Coast Guard.  This is part of the principle of [[joint warfare]].

== Some architectural and design challenges ==
* The complexity of the [[Joint Tactical Radio System]] (JTRS) offers insight into the challenges of integrating numerous different communications systems into a unified whole.  It is intended to be a [[software-defined radio]] for battlefield communications that will be backwards compatible with a very large number of other military and civilian radio systems. 

* The problem of coordinating [[bandwidth]] usage in a battlespace is a significant challenge, when every piece of mobile equipment and human participant becomes a potential source (or relay) of RF emissions.  

* It is difficult to efficiently transfer information between networks having different levels of security classification.  Although [[multi-level security]] systems provide part of the solution, human intervention and decision-making is still needed to determine what specific data can and cannot be transferred.  

* Accurate locational awareness is limited when maneuvering in areas where [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) coverage is weak or non-existent.  These areas include inside buildings, caves, etc. as well as built-up areas and urban canyons, which are also the settings for many modern military operations.  Much work on reliable [[sensor fusion|fusion]] of positional data from multiple sensors remains to be done.   

* Providing secure communications in NCW/NCO is difficult, since successful [[key management]] for [[encryption]] is typically the most difficult aspect of [[cryptography]], especially with mobile systems.  The problem is exacerbated with the need for speedy deployment and nimble reconfiguration of military teams, to respond to rapidly changing conditions in the modern battlespace.  

== International activities ==
There is significant need to harmonize the technical and operational aspects of net-centric warfare and net-centric operations among multiple nations, in order to support coalition activities, joint operations, etc.  [[STANAG]] is the coordinating vehicle for establishing shared technical standards among [[NATO]] nations.  

See also [[Partnership for Peace]] for information on extending coordination efforts to non-NATO nations that are keen to support MOOTW ([[military operations other than war]]) activities, such as international peacekeeping, disaster response, humanitarian aid, etc.

== Supporting comments ==
"With less than half of the [[ground forces]] and two-thirds of the military aircraft used 12 years ago in [[Desert Storm]], we have achieved a far more difficult objective ... In Desert Storm, it usually took up to two days for target planners to get a photo of a target, confirm its coordinates, plan the mission, and deliver it to the bomber crew. Now we have near real-time imaging of targets with photos and coordinates transmitted by e-mail to aircraft already in flight. In Desert Storm, [[battalion]], [[brigade]], and [[Division (military)|division]] commanders had to rely on maps, grease pencils, and radio reports to [[track]] the movements of our forces. Today, our [[commander]]s have a real-time display of our armed forces on their computer screen." <ref>[http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/2004/01/0401Raduege.html STSC Crosstalk]</ref> -- Vice President [[Richard Cheney]] .

"Net-centric warfare's effectiveness has greatly improved in 12 years. Desert Storm forces, involving more than 500,000 troops, were supported with 100 [[megabit per second]] (Mbit/s) of bandwidth. Today, OIF forces, with about 350,000 warfighters, had more than 3,000 Mbit/s of satellite [[Bandwidth]], which is 30 times more bandwidth for a force 45 percent smaller. U.S. troops essentially used the same weapon platforms used in Operation Desert Storm with significantly increased effectiveness."  {{fact}} -- Lt. Gen. Harry D. Raduege Jr., [[Defense Information Systems Agency]].

== Dissenting views ==
"Our incipient NCW plans may suffer defeat by [adversaries] using primitive but cagey techniques, inspired by an ideology we can neither match nor understand; or by an enemy who can knock out our vulnerable [[Global Positioning System]] or use [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapons on a limited scale, removing intelligence as we have construed it and have come to depend upon.  Fighting forces accustomed to relying upon downlinks for information and commands would have little to fall back upon."  -- Charles Perrow, [http://www.ndu.edu/ctnsp/IAverMay03.pdf Information Assurance, National Defense University, May 2003]

The aspiration of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) to embrace NCW is outlined in the document ''ADF Force 2020''.  This vision has been criticized by Aldo Borgu, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).  By developing interoperability with U.S. systems, in his view, the three arms of the Australian Defence Force could end up operating better with their sister United States services than with each other.
