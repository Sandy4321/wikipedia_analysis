In the speech, Krushchev criticized actions taken by the regime of [[Joseph Stalin]], particularly the purges of the military and the upper Party echelons, and the development of Stalin's [[personality cult]], while maintaining support for the ideals of Communism by invoking [[Vladimir Lenin]].

The speech was a milestone in the [[Khrushchev Thaw]].<ref>Tompson, William J. ''Khrushchev: A Political Life''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995.</ref><ref name="Taubman K Era">Taubman, William. ''Khrushchev: The Man and His Era'', London: Free Press, 2004.</ref> It was also a sign of an intense power struggle within the Soviet leadership in which Khrushchev made an effort to discredit those who had survived the long rule of Stalin, notably [[Lavrentiy Beria]].  Superficially, the speech was an attempt to draw the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] closer to [[Leninism]].  Khrushchev's aim, however, was primarily to garner public support for the arrest and execution of Beria three years earlier,<ref> Riasanovsky, Nicholas V. ''A History of Russia'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 530-31.</ref> as well as to legitimize his own recently consolidated power (seized from Stalin loyalists [[Viacheslav Molotov]] and [[Georgii Malenkov]]).

It was known as the "Secret Speech" because it was delivered at a closed session, and its actual text was printed only in 1989 (in the magazine ''<U+0418><U+0437><U+0432><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0426><U+041A> <U+041A><U+041F><U+0421><U+0421>'' (''[[Izvestiya CK KPSS]]''; ''Reports of the [[Central Committee]] of the Party''), #3, March 1989), although many Party members had already been informed of the speech as soon as a month after Khrushchev delivered it.

In April 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper (UK) included the speech in their series on "Great Speeches of the 20th Century."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/greatspeeches "Great Speeches of the 20th Century"], ''The Guardian''.</ref> 

==History==
The issue of mass repressions was recognized before the speech.

The speech itself was prepared based on the results of a special party commission ([[Pospelov]] (chairman), [[Komarov]], [[Aristov]], [[Nikolay Shvernik|Shvernik]]), known as the [[Pospelov Commission]], arranged at the session of the Presidium of the Party central committee on January 31, 1955. The direct goal of the commission was to investigate the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 XVII [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]].

The XVII congress was selected for investigations because it was known as "the Congress of Victors" in the country of "victorious [[socialism]]", and therefore the enormous number of "enemies" among the participants demanded explanation.

This commission presented evidence that during 1937<U+2013>38 (the peak of the period known as the [[Great Purge]]) over one and a half million individuals were arrested for "anti-Soviet activities", of whom over 680,000 were executed. 

While Khrushchev was not hesitant to point out the flaws in Stalinist practice in regard to the purges of the army and Party and the management of the [[Great Patriotic War]], he was very careful to avoid any criticism of Stalin<U+2019>s industrialization policy or Communist Party ideology.  When discussing mass repressions, the absence of any commentary on the haphazard arrests of ordinary citizens is notable and, it must be assumed, purposeful, since occurrences like the brutality of collectivization served the interests of the Party and the State.<ref name="K's War">Chamberlain, William Henry.

Stalin, Khrushchev argued, was the primary victim of the deleterious effect of the cult of personality,<ref name="K's War" /> which had, through his existing flaws, transformed him from a crucial part of the victories of Lenin into a paranoiac, easily influenced by the <U+201C>rabid enemy of our Party,<U+201D> Beria.<ref>Khrushchev, Nikita S. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1956khrushchev-secret1.html <U+201C>The Secret Speech<U+2013>On the Cult of Personality<U+201D>], ''Fordham University Modern History Sourcebook''.  Accessed September 12, 2007.</ref>

Despite the denouncing of political repressions, the process of rehabilitation of victims of political repressions was slow, although the release of political prisoners from labor camps started soon after Stalin's death. Still, the victims of the [[Moscow Trials]] were cleared of all charges only in 1988.

==Reports of the speech==
Khrushchev began the speech shortly after midnight; it took some four hours to deliver. Shortly thereafter, reports of it were conveyed to the West by [[Reuters]] journalist John Rettie, who had been told about the speech by Kostya Orlov a few hours before Rettie was due to leave for [[Stockholm]]; it was therefore reported in the Western media in early March. Rettie believes the information came from Khruschev himself via an intermediary.<ref> Rettie, John. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4723942.stm "The day Khrushchev denounced Stalin"], BBC, 18 February 2006.</ref>

On March 5, 1956, the Party Presidium ordered the reading of Khrushchev's Report at the meetings of all Communist and [[Komsomol]] organizations, with the invitation of non-members as well. Thus the contents of the report had become widely known in the country already in 1956, and the name "Secret Speech" is a misnomer. But as noted above, the full text was not officially released to the public until 1989.<ref name="Taubman K Era" />

However, the text of the speech was only slowly disclosed in the Eastern European countries. It was never disclosed to Western communist party members by their leaders, and most Western communists became aware of the details of the text after an American newspaper published a copy in mid-1956.

The content of the speech reached the west through a circuitous route. A few copies of the speech were sent by order of the Soviet Politburo to leaders of the Eastern Bloc countries. Shortly after the speech had been disseminated, a Polish journalist, [[Viktor Grayevsky]], visited his girlfriend, Lucia Baranowski, who worked as a junior secretary in the office of the first secretary of the Polish Communist Party, [[Edward Ochab]]. On her desk was a thick booklet with a red binding, with the words: "The 20th Party Congress, the speech of Comrade Khrushchev." Grayevsky had heard rumors of the speech and, as a journalist, was interested in reading it. Baranowski allowed him to take the document home to read.

As it happened, Grayevsky, who was [[Jew]]ish, and had made a recent trip to Israel to visit his sick father, decided to emigrate there. After he read the speech, he decided to take it to the Israeli Embassy and gave it to Yaakov Barmor who had helped Grayevsky make his trip to visit Grayevsky's sick father. Barmor was a [[Shin Bet]] representative; he photographed the document and sent the photographs to Israel.

By the afternoon of April 13, 1956, the Shin Bet in Israel had received the photographs. Israeli intelligence and United States intelligence had previously secretly agreed to cooperate on security matters. [[James Jesus Angleton]] was the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) head of counterintelligence and in charge of the clandestine liaison with Israeli intelligence. The photographs were delivered to him. On April 17, 1956, the photographs had reached the CIA chief [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]], who quickly informed U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After determining that the speech was authentic, the CIA leaked the speech to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in early June.<ref>Melman, Yossi.

==Summary==
The basic structure of the speech was as follows:

*Repudiation of Stalin's [[personality cult]]
**Quotations from the classics of [[Marxism-Leninism]], which denounced the "cult of an individual"
**[[Lenin's Testament]] and remarks by [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] about Stalin's character
**Before Stalin, the fight with the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]s was purely ideological; Stalin introduced the notion of the "[[enemy of the people]]" to be used as "heavy artillery"
**Stalin violated Party norms of collective leadership
***Repression of the majority of [[Old Bolshevik]]s and delegates of the XVII Party Congress, most of which were workers and had joined the Communist Party before 1920. Of the 1,966 delegates, 1,108 were declared "counter-revolutionaries", 848 were executed, and 98 of 139 members and candidates to the Central Committee were declared "[[enemies of the people]]".
***After this repression, Stalin ceased to even consider the opinion of the collective.
**Examples of repressions of some notable [[Bolshevik]]s are presented in detail.
**Stalin ordered that the persecution be enhanced: "[[NKVD]] is four years behind the schedule".
***Practice of falsifications followed, to cope with "plans" for numbers of enemies to be uncovered.
**Exaggerations of the role of Stalin in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] (World War II)
**[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Deportations of whole nationalities]]
**[[Doctors' plot]] and [[Mingrelian Affair]]
**Manifestations of personality cult: songs, city names, etc.<!-- to be continued -->

==Aftermath==
The speech caused such shock to the audience that, according to some reports, some of those present suffered heart attacks, and others later committed suicide.<ref>''From Our Own Correspondent'', [[BBC Radio 4]], [[22 January]] [[2009]].</ref> The ensuing confusion among many Soviet citizens, bred on the panegyrics and permanent praise of the "genius" of Stalin, was especially apparent in the [[Georgian SSR]], Stalin's homeland, where the [[1956 Georgian demonstrations|days of protests and rioting]] ended with the Soviet army crackdown on March 9, 1956.<ref name="Suny">[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]]. ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', [[Indiana University Press]], 1994, pp. 303<U+2013>05. ISBN 0253209153</ref>

Khrushchev's speech was followed by a period of liberalisation known as [[Khrushchev's Thaw]].  In 1961 the body of Stalin was removed from public view in Lenin's mausoleum and buried outside the [[Kremlin]] wall.
