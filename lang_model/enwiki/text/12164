Changi Airport is experiencing rapid growth. In 2005, the airport handled a record of 32.43 million passengers, a 7% increase over the 2004 fiscal year. This made it the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|26th busiest airport in the world]] and the sixth busiest in Asia by passenger traffic. In addition to being an important passenger traffic hub, the airport is one of [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|the busiest cargo airports in the world]], handling 1,854,610 tonnes of cargo in 2005. Incentives like the Air Hub Development Fund, first introduced in 2003, have proven effective in attracting airlines here. A new S$300 million fund to strengthen Changi's hub status will start in 2007 when the S$210 million fund expires in 2006. The new S$1.75 billion Terminal 3 is due to be opened in 2008, and Terminal 1 will be upgraded along the lines of the renovated Terminal 2, with the latter costing S$240 million. Changi has been courting both premium and budget travellers with the opening of a [[commercially important person]]s terminal by JetQuay, as well as a S$45 million Budget Terminal in 2006. 

Since its opening in 1981, the airport has made its mark in the aviation industry as a benchmark for service excellence, winning over 250 awards up to 2006.

{{TOCleft}}
==History==
Rapid growth in the global aviation transport was felt in Singapore, where [[Singapore International Airport]] at [[Paya Lebar]], Singapore's third civilian airport after [[Seletar Airport]] (from 1930 to 1937) and [[Kallang Airport]] (from 1937 to 1955), were facing congestion problems. Opened in 1955 with a single runway and a small passenger terminal, its inability to cope with the rising traffic became critical by the [[1970s]], when passenger numbers rose dramatically from 300,000 to 1,700,000 passengers annually in 1970, and then to 4,000,000 annually in 1975.

The government had two options available: expand the existing airport at Paya Lebar or build a completely new airport at another location. After extensive study, a decision was made in 1972 to keep the airport at Paya Lebar as recommended by a British aviation consultant. Plans were created for the building of a second runway and an extensive redevelopment and expansion to the passenger terminal building. A year later, however, the plans were reviewed again due to the [[1973 oil crisis]].

[[Image:Singapore Changi Airport, Control Tower 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Singapore Changi Airport control tower]]
Concerned that the existing airport was located in an area with potential for urban growth which would physically hem it in on all sides and limit its physical growth, the government subsequently decided in 1975 to build a new airport at the eastern tip of the main island at Changi on the site of the existing [[Changi Airbase]], where the new airport would be easily expandable by [[land reclamation]]. In addition, airplanes could fly over the sea, avoiding noise pollution issues within residential areas like those at Paya Lebar and helping to avoid disastrous consequences on the ground in the event of an air mishap. The existing airport in Paya Lebar was subsequently converted for military use as the [[Paya Lebar Airbase]].

[[Image:Singapore Changi Airport, Terminal 1, Departure Hall 7, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Departure hall seven, located in Terminal 1]]
===Construction===
The original master plan for Changi Airport involved constructing a dual-terminal and dual-runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the future. Phase 1 included the construction for the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and an 80&nbsp;metre (262&nbsp;ft) [[control tower]]. Construction for the second phase would commence immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 23 new aircraft parking bays in addition to the existing 45 bays, a second fire station and a third cargo agent building.

Land reclamation works involving the use of over 52,000,000&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;meters (68,000,000&nbsp;yd<sup>3</sup>) of landfill and seafill began in Changi in June 1975, even as the airport at Paya Lebar was still in the midst of expansion works. About 2&nbsp;square&nbsp;kilometers (494&nbsp;acres) of [[swamp]] land was cleared and filled with 12,000,000&nbsp;cubic&nsp;meters (15,700,000&nbsp;yd<sup>3</sup>) of earth from the nearby hills, while another 40,000,000&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;meters (52,300,000&nbsp;yd<sup>3</sup>) of sand were used to fill up the seabed. Canals were built to drain water from three existing rivers, namely Sungei Tanah Merah Besar, Sungei Ayer Gemuroh and Sungei Mata Ikan. In total, 870&nbsp;hectares (2,150&nbsp;acres) were reclaimed, raising the total site area to 1,300 hectares. Of this, landfill accounted for 200&nbsp;hectares (494&nbsp;acres) while seafill represented 670&nbsp;hectares (1,655&nbsp;acres).<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web|title = Some Facts on Changi Airport|publisher = Singapore Changi Airport|url = http://www.changiairport.com/changi/en/about_us/fact_sheets/facts_changi_ap.html|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

The first phase costing about [[S$]]1.3 billion commenced commercial operation on [[July 1]], [[1981]] with the first flight, Singapore Airlines SQ101 touching down at 0700 hours [[Coordinated Universal Time|Zulu]] with 140 passengers from [[Kuala Lumpur]].<ref name="infopedia">{{cite web|late = Muliani Tan|first = Bonny|title = Changi International Airport|work = singaporeInfopedia|publisher = National Library Board Singapore|date = 2001|url = http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_574_2004-12-23.html|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> Officially opened with much fanfare five months later on [[December 29]], [[1981]], the airport ended its first year operations with 12.1 million passengers, close to 200,000 tonnes of air freight handled and 63,100 aircraft movements. Sections of phase 2 opened progressively in the next few years, with Terminal 2 opening for passenger traffic nine years later on 1990 way ahead of traffic demand.

===Expansions===
[[Image:BudgetTerminal-Int.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The air-conditioned low-cost terminal opened in March 2006.]]
The Singapore Changi Airport has a development policy of always building years ahead of demand to help to avoid congestion problems common in major airports and maintain high service standards. While the original master plan details plans for two passenger terminals, there have been provisions to provide for long-term expansion initiatives, including the allocation of space for a third terminal planned to have a physical configuration mirroring that of Terminal 2.

Plans for Terminal 3 were reviewed, resulting in an new design concept which departs from the largely utilitarian architecture in the first two terminals. Topped by a unique roof feature designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]], the terminal is equipped with a full-service nine-story Crowne Plaza Hotel on its premises. Officials commenced construction in 1999 after receiving the green light in December of 1996. Originally planned for completion in 2006, the date was postponed by two years after global terrorism concerns delayed growth of air traffic in the airport. When completed in 2008, the expansion will increase the airport's total capacity to 64 million passengers. On [[May 30]], [[2006]], a topping out ceremony was conducted.

Changing needs in the aviation industry led to reviews in the masterplan, resulting in the decision to cater to the high-end as well as budget sectors of the air travel industry. The Budget Terminal became operational on [[23 March]], [[2006]] as the first such terminal to be conceptualised in Asia and was officially opened on [[October 31]], [[2006]]. A dedicated stand-alone CIP terminal opened by [[JetQuay]] on [[September 29]], [[2006]] was a first in Asia.

===Future plans===
Given limited land resources, Changi Airport was first conceptualised to function as the country's sole airport for the forseeable future without the need for relocation or the building of another airport when passenger figures increased. Long-term plans for the airport thus gave physical provisions in the form of reclaimed land nearly equal in size to that of the exiting airport, with enough space for two more runways and at least two new passenger terminal buildings. In 2006, a short runway was opened for [[Changi Airbase (East)]] on the site, an interim measure in preparation for its eventual expansion for passenger flights.

===Runways===
Changi Airport has two parallel runways, 02L/20R and 02C/20C. 02L/20R was completed and opened in 1981 as part of the airport's first phase. 02C/20C, formerly 02R/20L, was built completely on [[reclaimed land]] and opened with phase 2, 1.6&nbsp;kilometers (1.0&nbsp;mi) apart from 02L/20R. Both runways are equipped with four sets of Instrument Landing Systems to guide landing aircraft safely under all weather conditions. A new parallel runway 02R/20L was built 1.8&nbsp;kilometers (1.1&nbsp;mi) to the east of 02C/20C, used only for [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] aircraft as part of [[Changi Airbase (East)]]. The new runway is expected to be extended and eventually be turned into a third runway for the airport in future expansion plans.

===Passenger terminals===
Singapore Changi Airport has two terminals connected by a people mover system, with a third terminal under construction and due for completion in 2008. A terminal for low-cost carriers has been completed and started operation in late March 2006. In September 2006, JetQuay was opened for the high-end spectrum of the air traveling public, bringing the total handling capacity to 46.7 million passengers a year spread over an area of 679,100&nbsp;square&nbsp;meters (812,200&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>).

With Changi-based Singapore Airlines being the launch customer for the [[Airbus A380]], works to ensure full capability in handling the large aircraft was given priority in time for its planned introduction in October 2007. On [[August 16]], [[2005]], Changi Airport unveiled the first of eleven specially-built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to get on the upper cabin of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate holdrooms. The holdrooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater for the larger number of passengers flying the A380s. Beside the 11 new gates at Terminal 1 and 2, there will be eight more A380-capable gates at the new Terminal 3, ready in 2008.

In all, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore spent S$60 million in upgrading the terminals and airport infrastructure ahead of the arrival of the first A380. In the terminals, besides enlarged gate holdrooms and new fingers, the baggage belt carousels at the A380 gates were extended from the normal 70&nbsp;meters (230&nbsp;ft) to 90&nbsp;meters (295&nbsp;ft). With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does for the Boeing 747-400s, which carry significantly fewer passengers.

Changi Airport was the first in Asia to conceptualise and build a dedicated terminal catering to the budget traveller. In order to offer lower [[landing fee]]s, [[handling fee]]s and [[airport tax]]es, it cuts back on amenities such as [[aerobridges]], elaborate physical structures and decorations in the passenger terminal building. Still, air-conditioning, a range of [[duty-free shops]] and [[food and beverage|food & beverage]] outlets, and free internet terminals are available. There is no transfer facility at the Budget Terminal. Passengers who need to make transfers need to clear custom, collect their luggage, make their way to the main terminal by taking the free shuttle buses and re-checkin with the respective airline.

====Terminal facilities====
[[Image:Singapore_airport_pool.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Swimming pool within the transit area of Terminal 1]]
The airport has over 30,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;meters (322,900&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>) of space spread between its two terminals for shopping and eating outlets. In terms of sales, it outstrips other [[List of shopping malls in Singapore|shopping mall]] in Singapore, including those in top tourist-spot [[Orchard Road]]. The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] derives 60% of its total annual revenue (over [[US$]]500 million in the year ending March 2005) from non-aeronautical sources, with 30% from commercial space rental and a percentage of sale receipts. [[Liquor]] and [[perfume]]s are particularly popular, accounting for over half of total retail sales, followed by [[watch]]es and [[tobacco]] products. 

Extensive upgrading work on existing retail areas and their expansion since 2004 has increased sales 13.3% in the first half of 2005 year-on-year over 2004, and as much as 67% compared to the same period in 2003, with [[brand]]s such as [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Bulgari]] and [[Hermes]] opening outlets during this period. The airport enjoys "one of the highest concession revenues per passenger in the world" compared to other major international airports according to Jeffrey Loke, CAAS' assistant commercial director.

In addition to a wide array of duty-free shops and eating outlets, Changi Airport has six open-air garden areas. Open to customers of the airport, each garden represents a different group of plants: [[cactus|cacti]], [[bamboo]], [[heliconia]], [[sunflower]], [[fern]] and [[orchid]]. Changi Airport has numerous business centers located aound the airport.  Within the international transit area of the interconnected Terminals 1 and 2, internet and games facilties, prayer rooms, showers, spas, gym, swimming pool and a hotel are provided. Various lounge areas are provided, some including children's play areas or televisions showing news and movie channels.

===Airfreight===
The Air Cargo Division of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore manages the [http://www.changiairport.com/changi/en/airline_partners/facilities/changi_airfreight.html Changi Airfreight Centre] located in the north of the airport premises.<ref name="caasdivisions">{{cite web|title = Our Divisions|publisher = Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)|url = http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Divisions.html?__locale=en|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> Fueled by high economic growth in China, the airport handled 1,854,610 tonnes of air cargo in 2005, an increase of 3.3% over the 2004 fiscal year, making it the 10<sup>th</sup> busiest airfreight hub in the world and the fifth busiest in Asia. Due to Singapore's large electonics sector, electorical components constitute a singificant part of the total cargo traffic handled at the airport, although it has initiated attempts to diversify into the perishable air cargo market.

Relying on extensive use of Information Technology, the Air Cargo Division introduced various IT systems such as the Air Cargo EDI System (ACES), the Advance Clearance for Courier and Express Shipments System (ACCESS) and the Electronic Payment and Invoicing for Cargo (EPIC) to ease customs clearance procedures and movement. It pioneered the TradeNet System, allowing for traders to conduct trade declarations over the internet and speeding the approval process by controlling authorities. TradeNet will be linked to the country-wide Integrated Trade and Logistics IT platform.<ref name="flyinghigh">{{cite web|title = Flying High|work = News Room|publisher = EDB Singapore|date = [[2005-01-01]]|url = http://www.sedb.com/edb/sg/en_uk/index/news_room/publications/singapore_investment/singapore_investment01/flying_high.html|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

===Airline services===
====Ground handling====
[[Image:Singapore changi airport ground handling emirates.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ground handling of an Emirates [[Boeing 777-300]] by CIAS in Terminal 1]]
Ground handling services are handled by three companies: [[Singapore Airport Terminal Services]] (SATS), [[Changi International Airport Services]] (CIAS) and [[Swissport]]. SATS, a subsidiary of [[Singapore Airlines]], is the dominant player with close to 80% of the market in the airport. CIAS was formed in 1981 by the [[Port of Singapore Authority]] and five airlines ([[Air France]], [[China Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] and [[Lufthansa Airlines]]. It handles the remaining market share.

In the early [[2000s]], the government decided to introduce competition into the market by offering an additional license. [[Swissair]]'s [[Swissport]] successfully won the license (valid for 10 years) and commenced operations on [[March 2]], [[2005]]. As Swissair folded and was subsequently taken over by [[Swiss International Airlines]], the latter became the company's first customer. [[Adam Air]] chose Swissport as its ground handler in 2005, while [[Tiger Airways]] followed suit in 2006. Other customers of Swissport include [[Australian Airlines]], [[Swiss World Cargo]], [[Thai AirAsia]] and [[Cardig Air]].

CIAS underwent restructuring when its shareholding was bought over by [[Dubai]]'s [[Dnata]] group and [[Temasek Holdings]], being relaunched in June 2005 with a new branding. Its security services were amalgamated into the new Temasek-owned [[Aetos Security Management Private Limited]].

====Aircraft maintenance====
Five [[hangar]]s house facilities to provide aircraft maintenance support by [[SIA Engineering Company]] and [[ST Aviation Services Company]]. This includes a 20,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;meters (215,000&nbsp;ft<U+00B2>) column-free hangar which was the world's largest when opened in 1981.<ref name="infopedia"/>

==Security==
[[Image:Aetos 02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An [[Aetos Security Management|Aetos]] [[auxiliary police]] officer controlling access to the runway side of the Departure Hall at Terminal 1, Singapore Changi Airport]]

The airport's security comes under the purview of the [[Airport Police Division]] of the [[Singapore Police Force]]. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and naming of the airport as a terrorism target by the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], the airport's security has been stepped up. Roving patrol teams comprising of two soldiers and a police officer, armed with assault rifles, patrol the terminals at random intervals.<ref name="asianpoliticalnews">{{cite web|title = Singapore to Deploy Army at Changi Airport|publisher = Asian Political News|date = [[2001-10-08]]|url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2001_Oct_8/ai_80050529|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> These measures came at a cost partly bourne to the travelling public in the force of a "passenger security service charge," imposed since 2002.<ref name="straitstimes">{{cite web|title = Changi Airport to Impose Security Levy|publisher = The Straits Times|date = [[2002-01-10]]|url = http://www.traveltax.msu.edu/news/Stories/straitstimes6.htm|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> It is levied at [[S$]]6 on passengers in both main terminals and the Budget Terminal.<ref name="caasbudgetterminal">{{cite web|title = Budget Terminal|publisher = Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)|url = http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Budget_Terminal.html?__locale=en|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> In 2005, it became the first airport outside the United States to win the "Excellence in Airport Security Award".<ref name="bernama">{{cite web|last = Sawatan|first = Jackson|title = Changi Airport Wins Excellence In Security Award|publisher = Bernama Aviation News|date = [[2005-10-24]]|url = http://www.bernama.com/aviation_news/news.php?id=161938&lang=en|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

Assisting the state organizations are the security services provided by the ground handlers, namely that of the [[Singapore Airport Terminal Services]]'s [[SATS Security Services]] and [[Aetos Security Management]]. Both formed from a merger of the [[Changi International Airport Services]]'s airport security unit and that of other companies to become a single, island-wide auxiliary police company. These officers man check-in counters to screen luggage, control movements into restricted areas, and so forth.

In 2005, an upgrade in screening technology and rising security concerns led to luggage-screening processes being conducted behind closed-doors. Plans are in place to install over 400 cameras around the airport to monitor passenger activity around the clock and check on suspicious parcels and activity. Tenders to incorporate such a system was called in late September 2005.<ref name="abcradio">{{cite web|title = Singapore to Install More Security Cameras at Changi Airport|publisher = ABC Radio Australia|date = [[2005-04-10]]|url = http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1473762.htm|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> Singapore to install more security cameras at Changi airport] ''ABC Radio Australia'', April 10, 2005</ref> A second perimeter fence to prevent unauthorised persons is due for construction, to be completed by 2008.

In view of the heightened security alert at airports in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), security screening checks have been stepped up on passengers and their hand-carry luggage, as well as checked-in luggage on flights bound for destinations in the UK and the US from Singapore Changi Airport.<ref name="mediacorp">{{cite web|title = Singapore Steps Up Security at Changi Airport|work = Channel NewsAsia|publisher = Mediacorp News|date = [[2006-08-11]]|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/224300/1/.html|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

==Air transportation==
As all passenger traffic out of the airport is international in nature, the terminals in operation are equiped for international travel. Flights by Singapore Airlines, its regional subsidiary Silkair, two of its code-shared partners Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa, and some [[Southeast Asia]]-based carriers including Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines and Royal Brunei Airlines operate from the newer Terminal 2, while the majority of other airlines use Terminal 1. Two airlines, namely Tiger Airways and Cebu Pacific, utilize the Budget Terminal.

After recovering from a drop in passenger traffic as a result of the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome]] epidemic in 2003, the airport saw rapid growth in traffic which hit the 30 million mark for the first time a year later in 2004. A monthly record was set in June 2006 with 2,980,106 passengers handled, an increase of 9.1% in its first six months of operations for 2006. The Budget Terminal handled about 657,000 passengers as of [[October 26]], [[2006]], six months after its opening in March, and constituted 11.3% of total flights in October 2006 compared to 9.6% in April the same year.<ref name"changimedia">{{cite web|title = Media|publisher = Changi Airport|url = http://www.changiairport.com/changi/en/about_us/media.html|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> The terminal expects to handle its one-millionth passenger by the end of the 2006.<ref name="mediacorp2">{{cite web|title = Budget Terminal Passenger Volume to Hit One Million Mark by End-2006|date = [[2006-10-31]]|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/238617/1/.html|accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

==Ground transportation==
Changi Airport was built with ground ransportation considerations in mind from the onset, with the [[East Coast Parkway]] built and opened in tendem with the airport, providing a direct link to the city center. At a distance of about 20&nbsp;kilometers (12&nbsp;mi), the expressway was built almost entirely on [[reclaimed land]], thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.

While configured in a compact configuration such that the two main passenger terminal buildings and the upcoming Terminal 3 are sited adjacent to each other, allowing for travellers to venture between terminals on foot, a short people mover system was added to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers. This system is being replaced by a newer system which will connect the three main terminals in 2007 and will introduce greater security features by seperating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks. This rail system is not extended to the Budget Terminal, which is served by free shuttle buses to minimize operational costs.

===Inter-terminal transportation===
<b><span style="font-size:120%">Skytrain</span></b><br>
[[Image:CrystalMover-Changi-Int.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Crystal Mover Cars, similar to the ones used in the Sengkang LRT and Punggol LRT, operate on the Skytrain.]]
Skytrain services are available at the Skytrain stations located at the departure halls of both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. The system has been revamped with a new fleet of [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover Cars]], replacing the former [[Bombardier CX-100 Cars]] built in the early [[1990s]]. It runs between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 with free fares, operating between 6:00am and 1:30am daily. Plans for expansion include service to Terminal 3 and extending operation to 24 hours per day.


<b><span style="font-size:120%">Shuttle bus</span></b><br>
Shuttle busses run between Terminal 2 and the Budget Terminal. As with the Skytrain, fares are free and it operates 24 hours per day.

===Land transportation===
<b><span style="font-size:120%">Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)</span></b>
[[Image:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Changi Airport Station provides train services to the city.]]
The airport is connected to the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] network, with [[Changi Airport MRT Station|Changi Airport Station]] located underground between Terminal 2 and the future Terminal 3. It operates between [[Changi Airport MRT Station|CG2 Changi Airport Station]] and [[City Hall MRT Station|EW13 City Hall Station]] via a cross-platform transfer at [[Tanah Merah MRT Station|EW4 Tanah Merah Station]]. The stardard fare is S$1.40 on a standard ticket or adult [[EZ-Link]] card. It operates between 5:59am and 11:18pm daily, the trip taking 26 minutes, excluding waiting and transfer times.


<b><span style="font-size:120%">Bus</span></b><br>
''Main article: [[Changi Airport PTB 1 & 2 Bus Terminal]]

Buses functioned as the main transport mode for cost-conscious travellers as well as local airport staff for a large part of its history until the opening of [[Changi Airport MRT Station]] due to its relative affordability and reliability. Services operated by [[SBS Transit]] and [[SMRT Buses]] are accessible via a bus terminal located in the basement level of both terminals. Bus routes serve both terminals by first entering Terminal 1 before continuing to Terminal 2 and back to their points of origin.
