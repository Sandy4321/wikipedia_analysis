'''Maryland Route 313''' is a [[state highway]] located on the  [[Maryland Eastern Shore|Eastern Shore]] of [[Maryland]] in the United States. The {{convert|75.72|mi|km|2|adj=on}} route runs from [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]] in [[Mardela Springs, Maryland|Mardela Springs]], [[Wicomico County, Maryland|Wicomico County]] north to [[Maryland Route 213]] and [[Maryland Route 290]] in [[Galena, Maryland|Galena]], [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent County]]. It is predominantly a rural two-lane road that runs through agricultural areas a short distance west of the [[Delaware]] border, with the exception of a four-lane [[divided highway|divided]] bypass of [[Denton, Maryland|Denton]] shared with [[Maryland Route 404]]. MD 313 serves many communities, including [[Sharptown, Maryland|Sharptown]], [[Eldorado, Maryland|Eldorado]], [[Federalsburg, Maryland|Federalsburg]],  Denton, [[Greensboro, Maryland|Greensboro]], [[Goldsboro, Maryland|Goldsboro]], [[Barclay, Maryland|Barclay]], [[Sudlersville, Maryland|Sudlersville]], [[Millington, Maryland|Millington]], and [[Massey, Maryland|Massey]]. The route intersects many major roads, including [[Maryland Route 54]] in Mardela Springs, Maryland Route 404 in the Denton area, [[Maryland Route 302]] in Barclay, [[Maryland Route 300]] in Sudlersville, and [[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|U.S. Route 301]] near Massey.

The designation MD 313 was first used prior to 1927 for the road running from Eldorado to Galena, while the portion south to Mardela Springs was designated a part of [[U.S. Route 213]]. By 1940, the route was extended to Mardela Springs following a realignment of US 213. A few realignments to MD 313 had occurred by 1960 including one that moved the route to a new road between Federalsburg and Denton. In the 1980s, a four-lane divided bypass of Denton was built and the former alignment of MD 313 in the town became [[Maryland Route 619]]. This divided highway was extended further south of Denton in the early 2000s. The remaining two-lane portions of MD 313 that are concurrent with MD 404 are slated to be upgraded to a four-lane divided highway to provide relief to beach traffic along MD 404, a part of the main route between the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] and the Delaware beaches.

==Route description==

==History==
The designation MD 313 was in use by 1927 for the road running from Eldorado to Galena, while the current route between Mardela Springs and Eldorado designated as a part of [[U.S. Route 213]], which ran from [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]] to [[Elkton, Maryland|Elkton]].<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|title=Map of Maryland|year=1927|url=http://www.mdhighwaycentennial.com/images/template/gallery/maps/1927SIDE1.jpg|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> By 1940, US 213 was realigned to follow present-day US 50 between Mardela Springs and [[Easton, Maryland|Easton]], and MD 313 was extended south to end at US 213 in Mardela Springs.<ref name=1940mdmap>{{cite map|publisher=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|title=Map of Maryland|year=1940|url=http://www.mdhighwaycentennial.com/images/template/gallery/maps/1940SIDE1.jpg|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> By 1960, a few realignments of MD 313 had taken place. The route was moved to its current alignment between Federalsburg and Denton after originally following American Corner Road and MD 16 between the two towns. In addition, the route was rerouted to bypass Greensboro instead of passing through the town on Sunset Avenue (present-day MD 314) and Main Street (present-day MD 480) and a bypass of MD 313 was built east of Ingleside in place of following Roberts Station Road (present-day MD 19) and St. Paul Road.<ref name=1940mdmap/><ref name=1960mdmap>{{cite map|publisher=[[Maryland State Highway Administration]]|title=Map of Maryland|year=1960|url=http://www.mdhighwaycentennial.com/images/template/gallery/maps/1960SIDE1.jpg|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> In the early 1980s, a four-lane divided bypass of Denton was constructed for MD 313 and MD 404, with the alignment of MD 313 through Denton became MD 619.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidabrambleinc.com/history.htm|title=The History of David A.
