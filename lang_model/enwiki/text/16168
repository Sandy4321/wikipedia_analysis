{{dablink|This is an article about the single-engined amphibian Vickers Viking of 1918. For the Post [[World War II|World War Two]] twin-engined [[airliner]] see [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]].}}

The '''Vickers Viking''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] single-engined [[amphibious aircraft]] designed for military use shortly after [[World War I]].

==Design and development==
Research on [[Vickers]]' second amphibious aircraft type began in December [[1918 in aviation|1918]] with tests of alternative fuselage/hull designs occurring in an experimental tank at [[St Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. A prototype, registered G-EAOV, was a 5-seat cabin [[biplane]] with a [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] propeller driven by a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] motor. Sir [[John Alcock (aviator)|John Alcock]] died taking this aircraft or another early example to the Paris exhibition on [[18 December]] [[1919]], whilst trying to land at [[Cote d'Everard]], near [[Rouen]], [[Normandy]] in foggy weather.

The next example, G-EASC, known as the '''Viking II''', had a greater wing span and a 360 hp [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] VIII motor. The '''Viking III''' machine, piloted by Captain Cockerell, won first prize in the amphibian class in [[Air Ministry]] competitions held in September and October, [[1920 in aviation|1920]]. 

The Type 54 '''Viking IV''' incorporated further refinements and had a wider cabin above a hull one foot wider, an example being G-EBBZ in which [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross Smith]] and J.M. Bennett (partners in the 1919 [[England to Australia flight]]) died on [[13 April]] [[1922]] just outside the [[Brooklands]] racetrack near [[Weybridge]] in [[Surrey]]. Most of these Mark IV Vikings had a [[Napier Lion]] engine. 

The next version was the '''Viking V''', two were built for the [[RAF]] for service in [[Iraq]].

The last Viking amphibians were built during [[1923 in aviation|1923]], but the name was re-used for the twin-piston engined [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]] [[airliner]] some 22 years later, which saw service as the [[Vickers Valetta|Valetta]] with the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and other air arms. Some Viking amphibians were built by [[Canadian Vickers]] Limited, a subsidiary company in [[Montreal]] with no previous plane making experience.

A further development with a redesigned wing structure using the 450 hp [[Napier Lion]] would have been the '''Viking VI''' (Vickers designation '''Type 78''') but known as the '''Vulture I'''. A second with a Rolls-Royce Eagle IX (360 hp, 268 kW) was the '''Type 95 Vulture II'''. Both Vultures were used for an unsuccessful around the world attempt in 1924 after the Eagle engine of the Vulture II was replaced with a Lion. With registration G-EBHO, the first set off from [[Calshot Seaplane Base]] on [[25 March]] [[1924]], the other was shipped as a spare machine to [[Tokyo]]. After mechanical difficulties in earlier staged G-EBHO crashed at [[Akyab]] where it was replaced by G-EBGO on [[25 June]]. Encountering heavy fog on the [[Siberian]] side of the [[Bering Sea]] G-ENGO crashed. Vickers salvaged a large proportion.

The Viking Mark VII ("Type 83" in Vickers numbering) was a development of the Vulture, a three-seater open-cockpit fleet-spotter aircraft to [[Air Ministry specification]] 46/22 given the service name '''[[Vanellus]]''' when taken on for evaluation by the RAF against the [[Supermarine Seagull]] design.
