The '''2nd Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 17 June 1836.   It was the first of the [[The Boat Race| University Boat Races]] to be held in London, on a five-and-three-quarter-mile stretch between [[Westminster]] and [[Putney]]. For the first time, Cambridge sported light blue livery in the form of a ribbon on their boat while Oxford rowed in dark blue jerseys.  In a race umpired by Lord Loftus and Mr Hiceson, Cambridge won the race by 20 lengths to level the overall record at 1&ndash;1.

==Background==
[[File:Thames from Putney to Westminster 1842.jpg|right|thumb|The 1836 race took place between Westminster and Putney bridges.]]
[[The Boat Race]] is an annual [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]].  First held in 1829, no attempt was made to organise the second race until 1834.  Cambridge had initially proposed a race from [[Westminster Bridge]] to [[Hammersmith Bridge|Hammersmith]], while Oxford suggested Maidenhead.<ref>MacMichael, pp. 43&ndash;44</ref>  Although Cambridge agreed to compromise to race on any stretch of the Thames between Westminster and [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], no agreement was reached until 1836.  This year, both universities issued a challenge to one another, and arrangements for the event were made in a meeting at the Star and Garter pub in Putney on 16 June 1836.<ref name=mac47>MacMichael, p. 47</ref>  According to a journalist for ''[[The Morning Post]]'', there was disagreement over the length of the race, with Oxford preferring a short course of a mile and a half, while Cambridge opted for the same course as the previous year.<ref name= morningpost/>  It was agreed that the race was to take place the following day along the {{convert|5.75|mi|km|1|adj=on}} stretch of river between Westminster Bridge and [[Putney Bridge]],<ref name=mac47/><ref name= early>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/report/early-races | title = Boat Race &ndash; Early races| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 22 April 2014}}</ref> a championship course for professional [[Sculling|scullers]].<ref>Dodd, p. 86</ref>  It was also agreed that both boats would be steered by university men rather than professional [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxes]].<ref>Dodd, p. 87</ref>

The second Boat Race in the history of the event, it was the first to be conducted in London, with the [[The Boat Race 1829|inaugural race]] taking place at [[Henley-on-Thames]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/origins | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 28 February 2015|title = Races &ndash; Origins}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1829 race "easily".<ref name=results/>  Cambridge were coached by their [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] [[Thomas Selby Egan]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The [[Referee#Rowing|umpires]] for the race were both Oxonians: Lord Loftus, of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] and Mr Hiceson (or Mr Hickson) of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].<ref>Burnell, p. 49</ref><ref name=sportsman>{{Cite book| title = The Sportsman | volume =  1 | publisher = Joseph Rogerson| date = July 1836| pages = 49&ndash;50|  url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hJs9AAAAYAAJ}}</ref>

According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, this was the first year that Cambridge adopted light blue as their racing colours: an R. N. Phillips provided a strip of [[Eton College|Eton]] blue ribbon "which was fixed to the bows" of the boat.<ref name=drink16/>  Oxford wore white jerseys with dark blue stripes, as they had done for the 1829 race.<ref name=drink16/>

==Crews==
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 8.625&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (73.6&nbsp;kg), {{convert|0.875|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  None of the competitors had taken part in a previous Boat Race,<ref name=burn53>Burnell, p. 53</ref> while all participants were registered as British.<ref>Burnell, p. 38</ref>  George Carter followed his brother J. Carter who had rowed for Oxford in [[The Boat Race 1829|1829 race]].<ref>Burnell, p. 42</ref>

Oxford were favourites to win the race;<ref>{{Cite news | title = Grand Boat Race | work = Bradford Observer | date = 23 June 1836| page = 7}}</ref>  Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]].  Heavy rain began to fall two hours before the start of the race, yet "although the rain descended in torrents, all were gay".<ref name=morningpost>{{Cite news | title = Grand Rowing Match &ndash; Oxford and Cambridge| work = [[The Morning Post]] | date = 18 June 1836| page = 4}}</ref>  The race was started by the umpires at 4:20&nbsp;p.m., with Cambridge starting well, taking an early lead.<ref name=ross40/>  By [[Vauxhall Bridge#Old Vauxhall Bridge|Vauxhall Bridge]] Cambridge's lead was significant.<ref name=mac49>MacMichael, p. 49</ref>  Rowing "gallantly", author and former Light Blue rower William MacMichael noted that Cambridge had the race "all their own way" and passed under [[Putney Bridge]] about one minute and 20 lengths ahead of Oxford in a time of around 36 minutes.<ref name=mac49/>  The victory levelled the series at 1&ndash;1.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher= The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 26 October 2014}}</ref>

Sports writer [[Gordon Ross (writer)|Gordon Ross]] described the race as "a very hollow affair" in which Cambridge "completely outclassed their rivals".<ref name=ross40>Ross, p. 40</ref>  Drinkwater noted that the quality of rowing "was a good deal criticised by the [[Waterman (occupation)|watermen]] and amateurs of the [[Tideway]]".<ref name=drink16>Drinkwater, p. 16</ref>  According to the reporter for ''[[The Morning Post]]'', "the Oxonians never stood a shadow of a chance, although they looked bigger men".<ref name=morningpost/>  The author of ''The Sportsman'' claimed that "Cambridge had the best boat.  The one rowed by the Oxonians is too flat-bottomed for the Thames".<ref name=sportsman/>
