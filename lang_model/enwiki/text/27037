'''WUWG''' (90.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is the [[radio station]] of the [[University of West Georgia]] in [[Carrollton, Georgia]], and a part of the [[Georgia Public Broadcasting|GPB]] network. This station is one of several in the GPB system that also produces its own programming.  Licensed to the university, the station was transferred to GPB in 2004.

==History==
It has been on the air since 1973, originally with the callsign '''WWGC''', used when the school was named West Georgia College.  The station previously broadcast a very diverse [[college radio]] format, but now broadcasts the GPB radio feed from Atlanta, with some student specialty shows.  With an [[omnidirectional antenna]], it covers [[Carroll County, Georgia|Carroll County]] and somewhat beyond with 500 [[watt]]s [[effective radiated power|ERP]].

In August 1994, WWGC became an affiliate of [[Public Radio International]]. This allowed the hiring of a full-time station manager, Kevin Sanders, as well as the acquisition of new equipment such as satellite links and DAT (digital audio tape) recording machines. Also, the station began offering an even greater selection of programming, and a small staff, which is a revolving door of students, replaced annually upon the seniors' graduation. Several part-time staff members, Mass Communications students and university and community volunteers round out the station's personnel. WUWG-FM airs local news and features, as well as various popular student-produced programs.
