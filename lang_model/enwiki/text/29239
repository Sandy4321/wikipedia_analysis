"'''United States of Eurasia'''" is a song by English [[alternative rock]] band [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and is featured on their fifth studio album ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]''. The song was made available as a free [[Music download|digital download]] online on 21 July 2009 and is followed by an [[instrumental]] solo entitled "Collateral Damage", based on [[Nocturnes,_Op._9_(Chopin)#Nocturne_in_E_flat_major.2C_Op._9.2C_No._2|Nocturne In E-Flat Major, Op.9 No.2]] by [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]].

==Background and composition==
"United States of Eurasia" was the first song title to be confirmed as on ''The Resistance'', after fans worked it out from a photograph of its [[sheet music]] uploaded on the band's [[Twitter]] profile.<ref name="title">{{cite news |url=http://muse.mu/index.php?sec=news-407 |title=New Album Title |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] |accessdate=8 July 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="picture">{{cite web |url=http://www.twitpic.com/5flx3 |title=Score in Milan |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] ([[Twitpic]]) |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009 }}</ref> On 3 July 2009, the album's track listing was revealed, with "United States..." positioned fourth between "Undisclosed Desires" and "Guiding Light".<ref name="tracks">{{cite news |url=http://muse.mu/news/article/414/the-resistance-the-tracklisting/ |title=The Resistance: The Tracklisting |author=Muse management |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009 }}</ref>

In a pre-release interview featured in the August edition of music magazine ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', vocalist and guitarist [[Matthew Bellamy]] reveals the song to be inspired by "a book called ''[[The Grand Chessboard]]'' by [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]," explaining that "Brzezinski has the viewpoint that the [[Eurasia]]n landmass, ie [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], needs to be controlled by [[United States|America]] to secure the oil supply."<ref name="mojo">{{cite news |url=http://www.muselive.com/index.php?m=single&id=4709 |title=Muse in Mojo |publisher=Muselive |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009 }}</ref> Bellamy goes on to suggest that the song is also influenced by [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', in which Eurasia is one of Earth's three super-states.<ref name="mojo"/>

==Release <U+2013> "Project Eurasia"==

While initially thought to be the first single due to be released from ''The Resistance'', the band confirmed on their Twitter profile that "[[Uprising (song)|Uprising]]" would in fact be released as the [[lead single]], and that "United States..." would be the "prize" achieved by completing the "treasure hunt" activity set up by the band, "United States of Eurasia".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/musewire/status/2634252928 |title=To clarify!: Treasure hunt ... |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] ([[Twitter]]) |date=14 July 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> As of 20 July, all six sample segments of the song promised by the treasure hunt have been unlocked by the fan community; a message is currently being displayed on the project page, ordering viewers to report back soon for an "emergency flash briefing."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ununitedeurasia.muse.mu/music/ |title=Music |work=Ununited States of Eurasia |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] |date=20 June 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The main site then changed the green headline title from "Ununited States of Eurasia" to "United States of Eurasia".

On July 20 at approximately 12:00 PM (BST), the treasure hunt site "Ununited States of Eurasia" updated its map to include America and a banner reading "RECOGNITION FROM USA REQUESTED" with co-ordinates to a street in New York where the last phase is being played out. Interestingly, it is the only station that has a timed limit to it for activation and that failure in activating it will result in a Lockdown Crisis Mode which will mobilise "The Resistance".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ununitedeurasia.muse.mu/station/colossus/ |title=STATION//COLOSSUS |work=Ununited States of Eurasia |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> A subsequent Twitter post by Bellamy in reply to a fan states that US would have the grand finale and that they would have "a tough decision to make", hinting on the possibility that the final station should not be activated and that United States of Eurasia should not be recognised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/musewire/status/2704845831 |title=@Absinthe_Wolf You will have grand finale ...|publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] ([[Twitter]]) |date=18 July 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/musewire/status/2704878753 |title=US will play a vital role ... |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] ([[Twitter]]) |date=18 July 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Joe Ellis became the first DJ to air the new song on [[KXLL]] during his Sunday show on 19 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/zanelowe/ |title=ZaneLowe Radio1 |publisher=[[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]|date=20 July 2009}}</ref>

Following the conclusion of the treasure hunt on 21 July 2009, the song was made available for download<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muse.mu/news/article/429/united-states-of-eurasia---eurasia-recognised/|title=

==Reception==

The song has received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike. Music magazine ''[[NME]]'' published a pre-release interview with the band on 7 July, identifying "United States..." as one of the highlights of the album and describing how it "builds into a climax of multi-tracked [[Queen (band)|Queen]]-style vocals."<ref name="nme">{{cite news |url=http://www.muselive.com/index.php?m=single&id=4726 |title=Muse in NME |publisher=Muselive |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009 }}</ref> In a French review of the album published on MuseBootlegs.com, the song is likened to Queen's song "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", [[Maurice Jarre]]'s soundtrack for the 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and Polish composer [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]], the amalgamation of which is said to produce "A long, cinematic [[classic rock]] trip."<ref name="judebox">{{cite news |url=http://www.muselive.com/index.php?m=single&id=4737 |title=The Resistance Mini-Review |publisher=Muselive |date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009 }}</ref>

Online review magazine ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' was less receptive and granted the song a rating of 2 out of 10. Stating, "Even for a shameless group like Muse, 'United States of Eurasia' is pushing things a little too far...[with] rhetoric that'd make even the most passionate zealot roll their eyes."<ref name="Pitchforkmedia">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11417-united-states-of-eurasia-collateral-damage/ |title=Pitchfork: Track Reviews: Muse: "United States of Eurasia / Collateral Damage"|publisher=Pitchforkmedia |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009 }}</ref>
