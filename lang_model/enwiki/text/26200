'''William Edward Hanley Stanner''' (1905<U+2013>1981) was an [[Australia]]n [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who worked extensively with [[Indigenous Australians]]. Stanner had a varied career that also included journalism in the 1930s, military service in [[World War II]], and political advice on colonial policy in Africa and the South Pacific in the post-war period.

He was the [[Commanding Officer]] of the [[2/1st North Australia Observer Unit]] (NAOU) during [[World War II]], also known as the "Nackeroos" and recently{{when|date=January 2011}} coined "Curtin<U+2019>s Cowboys". The NAOU was the military predecessor to the modern [[NORFORCE]]. Formed in March 1942 and disbanded March 1945, they patrolled northern Australia for signs of enemy activity.

Stanner was an influential figure prior to the successful 1967 [[referendum]] on Aboriginal affairs which removed provisions in the [[Australian Constitution]] which discriminated against [[Indigenous Australians]]. In 1967, the [[Prime Minister]] [[Harold Holt]] invited Stanner to join [[H. C. Coombs]] and [[Barry Dexter|B.G. Dexter]] to form the Commonwealth Council for Aboriginal Affairs and advise on national policy. He subsequently played an important role in establishing the [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]].

Stanner coined the terms the ''Great Australian Silence'' and ''everywhen'' and brought them into general usage in his 1968 [[Boyer Lectures]] ''After the Dreaming'', which reflected on the silence on [[Indigenous Australians]] in [[History of Australia|Australian history]] after white settlement.

==Early career==

Stanner was born at [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watson's Bay, Sydney]] on 24 November 1905, the son of Andrew Edwin Stanner and Mary Catherine Stanner (n<U+00E9>e Hanley). He was educated at state schools and won a bursary to [[Parramatta High School]] (1919<U+2013>21), but was unable to stay on after the Intermediate Certificate. Stanner worked for two years in a bank and matriculated by private study. He worked as a journalist while studying at University. In 1927 Stanner obtained full-time work as a reporter for the Sydney ''Daily Guardian'' for [[Frank Packer]], the first of a number of posts in journalism which financed his studies in Australia and England.<ref name = "Metaphors"/>

At University, Stanner has an interest in athletics, football and was the secretary of the University's [[League of Nations]] Society. He stated afterward that his selection of anthropology as a profession was influenced by the famous anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]. Stanner worked as a journalist until 1932 by which time he was chief sub-edior of the ''Sunday Sun'' including several years in the Parliamentary Gallery. Stanner won the Frank Albert Prize in anthropology in two successive years and graduated with a BA (Honours) (Anthropology and Economics) in 1932.<ref name = "Metaphors"/>

In 1933 Stanner took up a temporary position on the personal staff of [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]], the [[Premier of NSW]], for whom he drafted parliamentary and public speeches and prepared reports. At that time he met [[H.C. Coombs]] and formed and enduring friendship with [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] who he worked with in later life. He received an MA (Class 1 Honours) in Anthropology in 1934 from the [[University of Sydney]] for which he did extensive field research in the [[Daly River]] region of Northern Australia. [[A. P. Elkin]] judged Stanner's 1934 thesis on culture-contact at the [[Daly River]] as "a work of outstanding quality". Stanner criticised the popular assumption that the main function of the anthropologist was "the naive search for uncontaminated aboriginal cultures". He presented an exposition of a method for studying contact and cultural change, insisting that this was "an important and neglected problem". Barwick, Beckett and Reay wrote in 1985 that already his lifelong concern with the practical value of anthropology to Aboriginal welfare was apparent.<ref name = "Metaphors"/>

In 1935, on his second field work, Stanner accompanied the [[Catholic priest]] Father [[Richard Docherty]] to Port Keats, now known as [[Wadeye]] on the south-western coast of the [[Northern Territory]], halfway between the mouths of the [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]] and [[Fitzmaurice River]]. Docherty was commissioned to establish a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] in the region and Stanner helped him choose the site. Over the next thirty years, the people of the two river valleys came in to the mission and eventually became permanent residents. On his appointment to the [[Australian National University]], Stanner renewed his interest in the Port Keats [[Wadeye]] area renewing old friendships. Much of his work as an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] was based on his field work with [[Indigenous Australians]] in the Port Keats [[Wadeye]] area.<ref name = "Appreciation"/>

Stanner moved to London in 1936 completed his PhD at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1938 studying under [[Bronis<U+0142>aw Malinowski]]. Compatriots included [[Phyllis Kaberry]] and Piddington. [[Jomo Kenyatta]], the first [[Prime Minister]] (1963<U+2013>1964) of [[Kenya]] and subsequently [[President]] (1964<U+2013>1978)  was a fellow student. Stanner also worked as a sub-editor in the Foreign Room at [[The Times]].<ref name = "Metaphors"/>

In March 1942 his pre-war experience in Northern Australia led to him being directed to "raise and command" to what became the 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU), otherwise known as 'Stanner's Bush Commandos'. At this time he enlisted in the 2nd AIF (1942<U+2013>1946). Known colloquially as 'Nackeroos', the men were deployed in small groups throughout the rugged north of Australia, where they observed and reported on signs of enemy activity, often patrolling on horseback. As the unit's Commander, [[Major]] Stanner made contact with many local Aboriginal groups, and employed some to assist his troops as guides and labourers. Nackeroo operations were scaled down as the threat of Japanese invasion passed, and the unit was eventually disbanded in March 1945. The history of the unit was documented in detail by Dr. Amoury Vane.<ref name = "Vane">{{cite journal

Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col) in 1943, Stanner served in Europe, Britain and then in British North Borneo (Lt-Col) as Senior Civil Affairs Officer for the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit (BBCAU) until the conclusion of the war.

==Career post WW2==

He continued his anthropological work after the war, becoming a prominent writer, lecturer and public advocate of the study and appreciation of Aboriginal society and its place in Australia.

==Referendum in 1967==

Stanner was an influential figure prior to the successful 1967 [[referendum]] on Aboriginal affairs which removed provisions in the [[Australian Constitution]] which discriminated against [[Indigenous Australians]].<ref name ="Windschuttle"/>

==Council for Aboriginal Affairs==

In 1967, the [[Prime Minister]] [[Harold Holt]] invited Stanner to join [[H. C. Coombs]] and [[Barry Dexter]] to form the Council for Aboriginal Affairs and advise on national policy. Stanner held that position through successive political regimes, including the [[Whitlam Government]], which began to implement much of the program Stanner, Coombs and Dexter endorsed: land rights, the movement to outstations, increased social welfare and community-based economies.<ref>Altman 2008, pp 274<U+2013>8</ref>

Stanner brought to this policy package an anthropologist's sensitivity to the importance of ceremony and ritual. In particular, at the handover of the first [[native title]] grant to the [[Gurindji people]]  at Wattie Creek in the [[Northern Territory]] in 1975, Stanner recommended Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] should perform the memorable symbolic act of pouring earth through the hands of Gurindji leader, [[Vincent Lingiari]].<ref>Dexter 2008, pp 83</ref>

==Boyer Lectures in 1968==

In 1968 Prof W.E.H. Stanner presented the [[Boyer Lectures]] titled "After the Dreaming". The Boyer Lectures began in 1959 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission|ABC]] (Australian Broadcasting Commission, now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation) Lectures. They were renamed in 1961 after [[Richard Boyer (broadcaster)|Richard Boyer]] (later Sir Richard), the ABC board chairman who had first suggested the lectures. The series is broadcast every year in November/December on ABC [[Radio National]]. The lectures have been delivered annually by prominent [[Australians]], selected by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Board. They have stimulated thought, discussion and debate in Australia on a wide range of subjects. Stanner's lecture has since been reprinted a number of times.<ref name ="Boyer"/>

==Family==

Stanner married Patricia Williams, a diplomat in 1962. The couple had two sons: Andrew Stanner and John Stanner.<ref name = "WW1971"/><ref name = "WW1973"/><ref name = "WW1977"/><ref name = "WW1980"/>
