'''Charles Burnham "Bud" Wilkinson''' (April 23, 1916 &ndash; February 9, 1994) was an [[American football]] player, coach, broadcaster, and politician.  He served as the head football coach at the [[University of Oklahoma]] from 1947 to 1963, compiling a record of 145&ndash;29&ndash;4. His [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] won three [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]] (1950, 1955, and 1956) and 14 conference titles.  Between 1953 and 1957, Wilkinson's Oklahoma squads won 47 straight games, a record that still stands at the highest level of [[college football]].  After retiring from coaching following the 1963 season, Wilkinson entered into politics and, in 1965, became a broadcaster with [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]].  He returned to coaching in 1978, helming the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] for two seasons.  Wilkinson was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a coach in 1969.

==Early life and playing career==
Wilkinson's mother died when he was seven, and his father sent him to the [[Shattuck Military Academy]] in [[Faribault, Minnesota]], where he excelled in five sports and graduated in 1933.  He enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], where, as a [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and [[quarterback]] for head coach [[Bernie Bierman]], Wilkinson helped lead the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Golden Gophers]] to three consecutive national championships from 1934 to 1936. He also played [[ice hockey]] for the University of Minnesota. Following his graduation in 1937 with a degree in English, he led the [[College All-Star Game|College All-Stars]] to a 6&ndash;0 victory over the defending [[National Football League|NFL]] champion [[Green Bay Packers]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] on August 31.

==Coaching career==
Wilkinson briefly worked for his father's mortgage company, then became an assistant coach at [[Syracuse University]] and later back at his alma mater, Minnesota.  In 1943, he joined the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], where he was an assistant to [[Don Faurot]] with the [[Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks football]] team and served as a hangar deck officer on the USS Enterprise. Following  [[World War II]], [[Jim Tatum]], the new head coach at the [[University of Oklahoma]], persuaded Wilkinson to join his staff in 1946. In fact, the OU Board of Regents stipulated that Tatum make Wilkinson his top assistant, or else their offer was null and void.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  After one season in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], Tatum left the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Sooners]] for the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].  The 31-year-old Wilkinson was named head football coach and athletic director of the Sooners.

===Head coach at Oklahoma===
In his first season as head coach in 1947, Wilkinson led Oklahoma to a 7&ndash;2&ndash;1 record and a share of  the conference championship, the first of 13 consecutive [[Big Eight Conference|Big Six/Seven/Eight Conference]] titles. Ultimately, Wilkinson would become one of the most celebrated college coaches of all time. His teams captured national championships in 1950, 1955, and 1956, and amassed a 145&ndash;29&ndash;4 (.826) overall record. An organized innovator, Wilkinson would post practice schedules that were broken down to the minute.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The centerpiece of his time in Norman was a 47-game winning streak from 1953 to 1957, an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] record that still stands today and has only been seriously threatened three times: by [[Toledo Rockets football|Toledo]] (35 wins, 1969&ndash;1971), [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami (FL)]] (34 wins, 2000&ndash;2003), and [[USC Trojans football|USC]] (34 wins, 2003&ndash;2005).  Earlier, the Sooners ran off 31 consecutive wins from 1948 to 1950.  Except for two losses in 1951, the Wilkinson-coached Sooners did not lose more than one game per season for 11 years between 1948 and 1958, going 107&ndash;8&ndash;2 over that period.  His teams also went 12 consecutive seasons totaling 74 games (1947&ndash;1958) without a loss in conference play, a streak which has never been seriously threatened.  Wilkinson did not suffer his first conference loss until 1959 against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], his 79th conference game.

Wilkinson's [[1955 Oklahoma Sooners football team|1955 Oklahoma team]] is widely considered to be one of the greatest teams in college football history, regardless of era.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  He was also the first collegiate football coach to host a television show, aptly named ''The Bud Wilkinson Show''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Wilkinson was also remarkable for compiling this record while showing a genuine interest and concern for the performance of his players in the classroom.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Following the 1963 season, his 17th at Oklahoma, Wilkinson retired from coaching at the age of 47.  Along with [[Bennie Owen]], [[Barry Switzer]] and [[Bob Stoops]], he is one of four football coaches to win over 100 games at the University of Oklahoma.  No other college football program has had more than three coaches to accomplish the feat.  While at Oklahoma, Wilkinson served on the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports|President's Council on Physical Fitness]] from 1961 to 1964.

==Later life and return to coaching==
[[File:Dkr-wilkinson.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Wilkinson with [[Darrell Royal]]]]
Wilkinson ran as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1964, at which point he legally changed his first name to Bud, but lost to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Fred R. Harris]].  He served as [[Republican National Committee]]man from Oklahoma, and was considered by [[Richard Nixon]] as chairman of the Committee, but was not selected.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1965, Wilkinson joined [[ABC Sports]] as their lead [[color commentator]] on college football telecasts, teaming with [[Chris Schenkel]] and, later, [[Keith Jackson]].  Wilkinson was the color analyst for three of the greatest games in college football history, each commonly referred to as a "[[Game of the Century (college football)|Game of the Century]]": [[1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game|Notre Dame vs. Michigan State in 1966]], [[1969 Texas vs. Arkansas football game|Texas vs. Arkansas in 1969]], and [[1971 Nebraska vs. Oklahoma football game|Nebraska vs. Oklahoma in 1971]].  Wilkinson is still considered one of the best color commentators of all time because of his solid analysis and in-depth insight.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Wilkinson was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969.  In 1978, Wilkinson returned to coaching with the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]]. After less than two disappointing seasons, he was fired and returned to broadcasting with [[ESPN]].

Wilkinson suffered a series of minor strokes and, on February 9, 1994, he died of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] at the age of 77.

==Personal life==
Wilkinson was married to the former Mary Schifflet in 1938, with whom he had two sons, Pat and [[Norman High School#Notable_alumni|Jay]]. They divorced in 1975.  A year later, he married Donna O'Donnahue, 33 years his junior, who survived him in death.
