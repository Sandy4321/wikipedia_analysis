{{Shia Islam}}
The '''Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism''' made [[Iran]] the spiritual bastion of [[Shia Islam]] against the onslaughts of [[Sunni Islam]], and the repository of Persian cultural traditions and self-awareness of Iranianhood, acting as a bridge to modern Iran. It also ensured the dominance of the Twelver sect within Shiism over the [[Zaydiyyah]] and [[Ismaili]] sects <U+2013> each of whom had previously experienced their own eras of dominance within Shiism. Through  their actions, the [[Safavids]] reunified Iran as an independent state in 1501 and established [[Twelver]] Shiism as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the [[history of Islam]].

==Pre-Safavid Iran==
Iran<U+2019>s population was mostly Sunni of the [[Shafi`i]]<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=cNG8MKDPVUMC&pg=PR14&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=171#v=onepage&q=&f=false The golden age of Islam, By Maurice Lombard, pg.Xiv]</ref> and [[Hanafi]] legal rites until the triumph of the Safavids (who had   initially been Shafi`i Sufis themselves).<ref name="Algar">"Iran: Safavid Period", Encyclopedia Iranica by Hamid Algar.

From 1500<U+2013>2 [[Ismail I]] conquered [[Tabriz]] in Iran, as well as [[Azerbaijan]]. He would take most of the next decade to consolidate his control over Iran, where most of the Persian population was still Sunni. His army spread out first to the central regions in 1504. He captured southwestern Iran between 1505 and 1508 before finally conquering the [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] region and the city of [[Herat]] in 1510.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8eUTLaaVOOQC&pg=PT57&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=85#v=onepage&q=&f=false Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces].  Steven R. Ward, p. 43.</ref> From the very beginning, the Safavid Dynasty was established on two foundations. One was Shia and the other was Persia, and Ismail concentrated more on the first than the second.  His hatred of the Sunnis knew no bounds: he was the most intolerant Shia ruler since the fall of the [[Fatimids]] and his persecution of Sunnis was ruthless. He aimed at no less than the complete destruction of Sunnism.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=TPbLcSlUs8cC&pg=PA191&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=58#v=onepage&q=safavid%20persia%20conversion&f=false A new introduction to Islam].  Daniel W. Brown, p. 191.</ref> Thus, the alternative for the majority of the Persians (who were Sunnis at the time), was either convert to Shiism or accept death.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=NK6_hIN8SOwC&pg=PT195&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=49#v=onepage&q=safavid%20persia%20conversion&f=false Iran and America: re-kindling a love lost].  Badi Badiozamani, pp. 174<U+2013>5.</ref>  Consequently, in the territory that came fully under his control, he was astonishingly successful in enforcing the conversion of the populace from Sunnism to Shiism.

===Reasons for Ismail<U+2019>s conversion policy===
More than most Muslim dynasties the Safavids worked for conversion to their branch of Islam and for ideological conformity. The reasons for this conversion policy included:
* One of the main reasons why Ismail and his followers pursued such a severe conversion policy was to give Iran and the Safavid lands as distinct and unique an identity as was possible compared to its two neighboring Sunni Turkish military and political enemies, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and, for a time, the [[Central Asian]] [[Uzbeks]] <U+2014> to the west and north-east respectively.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tTqPdDNgfYoC&pg=PA11&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution].

Audrey L Altstadt, p. 5.</ref>
*The Safavids were engaged in a lengthy struggle with the Ottomans <U+2014> including numerous wars between the two dynasties <U+2014> and this struggle continuously motivated the Safavids to create a more cohesive Iranian identity to counter the Ottoman threat and possibility of a fifth-column within Iran among its Sunni subjects.<ref>Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution].  Nikki R Keddie, Yann Richard, p. 11.</ref>
*The conversion was part of the process of building a territory that would be loyal to the state and its institutions, thus enabling the state and its institutions to propagate their rule throughout the whole territory.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=YEGw8S3ovaoC&pg=PA170&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=89#v=onepage&q=&f=false The failure of political Islam].  Olivier Roy, Carol Volk, p. 170.</ref>

===Methods of converting Iran===
Ismail consolidated his rule over the country and launched a thorough and at times brutal campaign to convert the majority Sunni population to Twelver Shiism and thus transform the religious landscape of Iran.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m-Hw_PFOlLsC&pg=PA29&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false The modern Middle East: a political history since the First World War].  Mehran Kamrava, p. 29.</ref> His methods of converting Iran included:
*Imposing Shiism as the state and mandatory religion for the whole nation and much forcible conversions of Iranian Sufi Sunnis to Shiism.<ref>Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution].

Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer, p. 360.</ref><ref>Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces.  Steven R Ward, pg.43</ref>
*He reintroduced the Sadr (Arabic, leader) <U+2013> an office that was responsible for supervising religious institutions and endowments. With a view to transforming Iran into a Shiite state, the Sadr was also assigned the task of disseminating Twelver doctrine.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=J7YJoty2kuIC&pg=PA77&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false Iran: a short history: from Islamization to the present].  Monika Gronke, p. 91.</ref>
*He destroyed Sunni mosques. This was even noted by [[Tom<U+00E9> Pires]], the Portuguese ambassador to China who visited Iran in 1511<U+2013>12, who when referring to Ismail noted: "He (i.e. Ismail) reforms our churches, destroys the houses of all [[Moors]] who follow (the [[Sunnah]] of) Muhammad<U+2026>"<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Yjf0bM5sFaEC&pg=PA20&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=47#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Judeo-Persian poet <U+2018>Emr<U+0101>n<U+012B> and his "Book of treasure": <U+2018>Emr<U+0101>n<U+012B>'s Gan<U+01F0><U+2026>]  <U+2018>Emr<U+0101>n<U+012B>, David Yeroushalmi, p. 20.</ref>
*He enforced the ritual and compulsory cursing of the first three Sunni Caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]]) as usurpers, from all mosques, disbanded Sunni [[Tariqah]]s and seized their assets, used state patronage to develop Shia shrines, institutions and religious art and imported Shia scholars to replace Sunni scholars.<ref>A new introduction to Islam.

*He shed Sunni blood and destroyed and desecrated the graves and mosques of Sunnis. This caused the Ottoman Sultan [[Bayezid II]] (who initially congratulated Ismail on his victories) to advise and ask the young monarch (in a <U+201C>fatherly<U+201D> manner) to stop the anti-Sunni actions. However, Ismail was strongly anti-Sunni, ignored the Sultan's warning, and continued to spread the Shia faith by the sword.<ref>Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces.  Steven R.

*With the establishment of Safavid rule, there was a very raucous and colourful, almost carnival-like holiday on 26 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] (or alternatively, 9 [[Rabi' al-awwal]]) celebrating the [[Hadith of the assassination of Umar#Eid on the day of Umar<U+2019>s assassination|murder of Caliph Umar]]. The highlight of the day was making an effigy of Umar to be cursed, insulted, and finally burned. However, as relations between Iran and Sunni countries improved, the holiday was no longer observed (at least officially).<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8ZIjyEi1pd8C&pg=PA23&dq=sunni+iran&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=54#v=onepage&q=sunni%20iran&f=false Culture and customs of Iran].

==The fate of Sunni and Shia Ulema (scholars)==

===Sunni Ulema===
The early Safavid rulers took a number of steps against the Sunni Ulema of Iran. These steps included giving the Ulema  the choice of conversion, death, or exile<ref name="Islam pg.191">A new introduction to Islam, By Daniel W. Brown, pg.191</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=srLGT3dwTogC&pg=PA42&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=safavid%20persia%20conversion&f=false The Middle East and Islamic world reader, By Marvin E.

===Arab Shia Ulema===
After the conquest, Ismail began transforming the religious landscape of Iran by imposing Twelver Shiism on the populace. Since most of the population embraced Sunni Islam and since an educated version of Shiism was scarce in Iran at the time, Ismail  imported a new Shia Ulema corps from traditional Shiite centers of the Arabic speaking lands, such as [[Jabal Amil]] (of Southern Lebanon), [[Bahrain]] and [[Southern Iraq]] in order to create a state clergy. Ismail offered them land and money in return for loyalty. These scholars taught the doctrine of Twelver Shiism and made it accessible to the population and energetically encouraged conversion to Shiism.<ref name="Islam pg.170"/><ref>The Cambridge illustrated history of the Islamic world, By Francis Robinson, pg.72</ref><ref>The Middle East and Islamic world reader, By Marvin E. Gettleman, Stuart Schaar, pg.42</ref><ref name="Peter N. Stearns pg.360">The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern ... By Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer, pg.360</ref> To emphasize how scarce Twelver Shiism was then to be found in Iran, a chronicler tells us that only one Shia text could be found in Ismail<U+2019>s capital Tabriz.<ref name="Iran pg.91">Iran: religion, politics, and society : collected essays, By Nikki R. Keddie, pg.91</ref> Thus it is questionable whether Ismail and his followers could have succeeded in forcing a whole people to adopt a new faith without the support of the Arab Shiite scholars.<ref name="Iran pg.90"/> The rulers of Safavid Persia also invited these foreign Shiite religious scholars to their court in order to provide legitimacy for their own rule over Persia.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=l1ybylkCCLAC&pg=PA13&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=66#v=onepage&q=&f=false Shi<U+2018>ite Lebanon: transnational religion and the making of national identities, By Roschanack Shaery-Eisenlohr, pg.12-13]</ref>

[[Abbas I of Persia]], during his reign, also imported more Arab Shia Ulema to Iran, built religious institutions for them, including many [[Madrasah]]s (religious schools) and successfully persuaded them to participate in the government, which they had shunned in the past (following the [[Hidden imam]] doctrine).<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=G-M3IRh22moC&pg=PT52&dq=sunni+iran&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=300#v=onepage&q=sunni%20iran&f=false Science under Islam: rise, decline and revival, By S.

==Conversions beyond Iran==

===Azerbaijan===
After conquering Tabriz in Iran, along with Azerbaijan and Armenia from 1500<U+2013>02,<ref name="Immortal pg.43"/> one of the first acts of Ismail was to declare Twelver Shiism to be the state religion, despite the predominance of Sunni Muslims in the newly acquired territories. After the declaration, a conversion campaign was launched<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tcPWhU10mGMC&pg=PA205&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=116#v=onepage&q=safavid%20persia%20conversion&f=false The evolution of middle eastern landscapes: an outline to A.D. 1840, Part 1840, By John Malcolm Wagstaff, pg.205]</ref> and Muslim [[peoples of the Caucasus]], came under heavy pressure to accept Shiism.<ref>The Azerbaijani Turks: power and identity under Russian rule, By Audrey L. Altstadt, pg.5</ref> The imposition of Shiism was especially harsh in [[Shirvan]], where a large Sunni population was massacred.<ref>[[History of Azerbaijan#Safavids and the rise of Shi'a Islam|Safavids and the rise of Shi'a Islam]]</ref> Thus, the population of Azerbaijan was forcibly converted to Shiism in the early 16th century, when the Safavids held sway over it.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=N8IKR0oqdRkC&pg=PA158&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=201#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Caspian: politics, energy and security, By Shirin Akiner, pg.158]</ref>

===Iraq===
Ismail peacefully seized [[Baghdad]] in 1508. However, his armies zealously murdered Sunnis and actively persecuted them through tribal allies of the Shah.<ref>Iraq: Old Land, New Nation in Conflict, By William Spencer, pg.51</ref> His armies also destroyed several important Sunni sites, including the tombs of [[Ab<U+016B> <U+1E24>an<U+012B>fa]] and [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]]. The Safavids even expelled the family of Gilani from [[Mesopotamia]]. After declaring Shiism the official form of Islam in [[Iraq]], Ismail forced his new Iraqi subjects to convert to Shiism and outlawed Sunni practices. He then returned to Persia. These draconian actions by the conquering Safavids caused the Mesopotamian Sunnis to seethe with resentment.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=eaZGqG2thWAC&pg=PA48&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=194#v=onepage&q=&f=false The history of Iraq, By Courtney Hunt, pg.48]</ref>
[[Image:Iraq map.png|frame|Iraq Map]]
Likewise, under [[Tahmasp I]], central and southern Iraq, including Baghdad and [[Basra]] had remained in Safavid hands and efforts were being made to establish Shiism in place of Sunnism in these lands. Sunni scholars who refused to accept Shia doctrines were executed and Sunni tombs and shrines were destroyed once again, while the main mosques were converted for Shia use only. While not extensive, some conversions did take place, and those remaining faithful to Sunnism were subjected to persecution until [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] expelled the Safavids from most of Iraq.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Xd422lS6ezgC&pg=PA95&dq=sunni+iran&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=242#v=onepage&q=sunni%20iran&f=false History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Volume 1], By Ezel Kural Shaw, pg.95]</ref>

When the [[Safavids]] returned in 1624 under the rule of [[Abbas I of Persia]] and reconquered [[Baghdad]], they once more again massacred the [[Sunni]] inhabitants.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=x92G7UqX0_cC&pg=PA17&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=138#v=onepage&q=&f=false Gulf States, By Michael Gallagher, pg.17]</ref>

==Significant figures during the conversion process==

===Ismail II===
{{further|Ismail II}}
[[Ismail II]]<U+2019>s reign (1576<U+2013>77) was marked by a pro-Sunni policy.<ref>The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern. Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer, p. 360.</ref> With the assistance of Mirza Makhdum al-Sharifi, the new Sadr, Ismail II strove to reverse the anti-Sunni practices among the populace. More specifically he strove to halt the public defamation of [[Aisha]] and the ritual cursing of [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]] and [[Uthman]], which rose during early Safavid rule. A few motives may account for his approach to the anti-Sunni propaganda. A primary one was that he was keen to comply with one of the Ottoman demands of the [[Peace of Amasya]] concluded in 1555, which called for an end to the vilification of the first three [[Sunni]] [[Caliph]]s, thus placating the Ottomans and solidifying his own personal position. Another was his attempt to weaken the clerics as he attempted to forcibly demand land grants from [[Sayyid]]s and Shia Ulema. The shah also clashed with the Ustajlu tribe and a number of [[Qizilbash]] amirs who were allied to the clerics. Thus, the public denunciation of Sunni emblems became one stage on which this power struggle between the Shah and the cleric-[[Qizilbash]] group was played out. The Shah also hoped to weaken the public appeal of the [[Jabal Amel|Amili]] clerics who administered and encouraged ritual cursing of the first three Sunni Caliphs among Iranians.  His Sunni flirtation was also intended to reach out to the still-strong Sunni sympathies among Persians. Despite their quick rejection of [[Ismail II]]<U+2019>s policies, the majority of Ulema and the military-political centre avoided a confrontation with him, even though in place of zealous Shia scholars like the [[Astarabadi]]s, the Shah appointed Ulema with Sunni leanings such as Mawlana Mirza Jan Shirazi and Mir Makhdum Lala.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=elHww0W0ZO4C&pg=PA88&dq=sunni+iran&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=202#v=onepage&q=sunni%20iran&f=false Distant relations: Iran and Lebanon in the last 500 years].

===Abbas I of Persia===

Olivier Roy, Carol Volk, p. 170.</ref> Abbas hated the Sunnis, and forced the population to accept Twelver Shiism. Thus by 1602 most of the formerly Sunnis of Iran had accepted Shiism.

[[Image:Portrait of Allamah Majlisi.jpg|thumb|225px|Portrait of [[Allamah al-Majlisi|Allamah]] [[Muhammad Baqir Majlesi]].]]

===Emergence of a clerical aristocracy===
Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia, many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so called ''vaqf''. They would thus retain the official ownership and secure their land from being confiscated by royal commissioners or local governors, as long as a percentage of the revenues from the land went to the ulama the quasi-religious organizations run by [[dervish]]es (''futuvva''). Increasingly, members of the religious class, particularly the [[mujtahid]]s and the [[seyyed]]s, gained full ownership of these lands, and, according to contemporary historian [[Iskandar Beg Munshi|Iskandar Munshi]], Persia started to witness the emergence of a new and significant group of landowners.<ref>RM Savory, Safavids, Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed page 185-6.</ref> From then on many [[seyyed]]s also further propagated the idea that Ali should have been the first caliph and that by becoming the first caliph Abu Bakr had broken the link that proved that they should have more rights.

===Sultan Husayn===
{{further|Sultan Husayn}}
During the reign of [[Sultan Husayn]] (1694<U+2013>1722) (the last effective Safavid shah), there was a lot of religious unrest and religiously motivated rebellions in the Safavid state.

When [[Sultan Husayn]] tried to forcibly convert his Afghan subjects in southern [[Afghanistan]] from Sunni to Shia, the Safavid conversion policies caused [[Mir Wais Hotak]] (chief of the [[Ghilzai]] Afghans) to start a rebellion in the [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar region]] in 1709. Mir Wais and his Sunni Afghans killed the Safavid governor [[George XI of Kartli]], including the Shah armies, and made the Afghan area free from Shia's rule.<ref>Packard Humanities Institute - Persian Literature in Translation - Chapter IV: ''An Outline Of The History Of Persia During The Last Two Centuries (A.D. 1722-1922)''...[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=90001014&ct=29 page 29]</ref> The declaration of independence at [[Kandahar]] in 1709 was a turning point that was followed by the conquest of [[Herat]] by the [[Ghilzai]] Afghans in 1715 and the invasion of Iran.

===Nader Shah===

{{further|Nader Shah}}
During the reign of [[Nader Shah]], an anti-Shiite policy was implemented. Nader made an unsuccessful attempt to return Iran to the Sunni fold by propagating the integration of Shiism into Sunnism as the fifth of the already extant four Sunni [[Madh'hab]]s (to be called the Jaafari Madh'hab).<ref>Nadir Shah and the Ja 'fari Madhhab Reconsidered, Ernest Tucker, Iranian Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1/4, Religion and Society in Islamic Iran during the Pre-Modern Era (1994), pp. 163-179, Published by: International Society for Iranian Studies [http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4310891?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21103813818403]</ref> However, the scheme to establish this form of Sunnism as the state religion failed to win support among most of the population.<ref>The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern.

The reasons for his anti-Shia policy included:
*Most of his troops were Sunni Afghan, [[Steppe]] Turkmen, Khorasan [[Kurds]] and [[Baluchis]], since his own pro-Sunni beliefs had alienated his Shiite Iranian soldiers, who included the Shia Turkmen and ethnic Persian soldiers from central and western Iran, who made up the Safavid partisans.<ref>The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern.

Steven R Ward, p. 52.</ref><ref>Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant, By Michael Axworthy, pg.165-166</ref>
*It was an original religious policy, aimed at weakening Shia power, promoting his own rule in Sunni lands outside Iran and making Shiism a 5th school of orthodox Sunni Islam <U+2014> a proposal rejected by both Sunni rulers and Shiites.<ref name = "Keddie 92">Iran: religion, politics, and society: collected essays.  Nikki R Keddie, p. 92.</ref>
*Nader made various attempts to reconcile his Persian subjects<U+2019> Shia beliefs with the Sunni creed and sought to get the Ottomans to recognize this new Persian Sunnism as its own sect with the possible motivation being to facilitate relations with the Sunni Ottomans, but possibly his real aim was to overthrow the Turks by uniting the Muslim world with him as its head.<ref>Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces.  Steven R Ward, p. 51.</ref>
*In 1736 after being chosen by an assembly of notables to be Shah, Nader agreed to accept on condition that they accept his new religious policy of restoring Sunnism in Iran. The abandonment of Shiism was necessary as the linchpin of a peace treaty he wanted to conclude with the Sunni Ottomans and was probably intended also as a way of diminishing the religious prestige of the Safavid house and of making himself a more attractive figure to the Sunni populations of areas he was planning to conquer.  However, his religious policy fueled discontent in Iran itself.<ref>Iraq: Old Land, New Nation in Conflict, By William Spencer, p. 23.</ref>

He implemented the following anti-Shia policies:
*Nader abandoned [[Shiism]] and instead founded a mixed [[Shia]]/[[Sunni]] [[Islamic theology|Islamic school of theology]], to add to the other four Sunni schools of law.<ref>Science under Islam: rise, decline and revival.  SM Deen, p. 38.</ref>
*Nader had the leading cleric in Persia strangled.<ref name = "Axwor<U+00FE>y 165-6">Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant.  Michael Axworthy, p. 165<U+2013>6.</ref>
*He relied on his army, which was increasingly recruited from Sunni Afghans, Kurds, Turkmen, Baluchis and others (who naturally were gratified by the new religious policy).<ref name = "Axwor<U+00FE>y 165-6" />
*The Persians were not simply ordered to adopt Sunnism as practiced elsewhere in the Muslim world; they were to retain their own discrete religious identity.<ref name = "Axwor<U+00FE>y 165-6" />
* Internally, he banned certain Shia practices; the more extreme ones, typical of the early Safavid period.  He issued instructions to the Ulema that [[Imam Ali]] should be venerated as before, but that the formula naming him as the deputy of God should no longer be spoken, because it had caused enmity between Shias and Sunnis. Externally he presented the policy as a wholesale conversion to Sunnism. In general, this religious policy did not provoke popular opposition within Persia because the people simply adapted.<ref name = "Axwor<U+00FE>y 165-6" />
*In 1736 from [[Qazvin]] he issued an edict that was sent throughout the country, enforcing the cessation of the traditional Shia practices that were most offensive to Sunnis.<ref>Sword of Persia: Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant].  Michael Axworthy, pp. 173, 176.</ref>
*Nader made a major effort to redefine the place of Shiism within the Islamic world by working to gain recognition from the major Sunni powers. He attempted to integrate a redefined Shiism into the Sunni tradition. He rejected the Shia condemnation of the first three Sunni Caliphs and enforced that position within his realm. In addition, he tried to secure Ottoman recognition of Twelver Shiism as a fifth Sunni school of law, to be called the Jaafari school after the 6th Imam, [[Jafar al-Sadiq]]. The whole pattern of Shiism as built on the idea of the [[Imamate]] was to be replaced. However, neither the Sunni Ottomans nor the major Shia scholars of the time accepted his redefinition.<ref>Islam, continuity and change in the modern world].  John Obert Voll, pp. 80<U+2013>1.</ref>
*Nader alienated the Shiite clergy (partly in order to destroy the influential position they held) by trying to bridge the gap between Sunni and Shia by attempting to restore Sunnism in Iran. He also confiscated large sections of the religious endowment lands ([[Waqf]]s) belonging to Shia religious institutions. Fearful for their lives and feeling threatened in Iran, many Persian clergymen sought refuge and settlement in Iraq and formed the core of the Shia religious infrastructure that has persisted until the present around the Shia shrines in Iraq, such as [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]].<ref name="Islam.

Monika Gronke, p. 95.</ref>

After Nader<U+2019>s death and the rapid disintegration of his empire, Shiism was quickly restored and religious properties were built up again in the following century.<ref name = "Keddie 92" />

Ismail<U+2019>s conversion policy had the following historical outcomes:
*Although conversion was not as rapid as Ismail<U+2019>s forcible policies might suggest, the vast majority of those who lived on the [[Iranian plateau]] did identify with Shiism by the end of the Safavid era in 1722. Hence it is no accident that today Iran<U+2019>s Sunni minorities are concentrated among the country<U+2019>s non-Persian ethnic groups that are scattered along the country<U+2019>s borders, with their Sunni co-nationals next door.<ref name="Islam pg.191"/><ref name="Iran pg.91"/><ref>Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution, By Nikki R.

*The Safavid experience largely created the clear line of political demarcation and hostility between Twelver Shiism and Sunnism, even though doctrinal differences had long been recognized. Before the Safavids the Twelvers for many centuries had mostly accommodated themselves politically to the Sunnis, and numerous religious movements combined Twelver and Sunni ideas.<ref>Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution, By Nikki R.

*Iran was a Shia country and gradually became an isolated island surrounded by a sea of Sunnism.
