'''''The Black Parade''''' is the third studio [[album]] by the [[emo music|rock]] [[quintet]] [[My Chemical Romance]]. Released in [[October 23]], [[2006]] through [[Reprise Records]], it was produced by [[Rob Cavallo]] who has also produced albums for [[Green Day]]. The album is the first for which [[Bob Bryar]] plays drums, as [[Matt Pelissier]] played drums for ''[[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]''. It is a [[concept album]] centering on a character known as "The Patient". The album presents the story of his passage out of life, and his subsequent reflection on his life.<ref name="VH1">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=My Chemical Romance Unveil Black Parade Track Listing, Album Art | date=2006-09-13 | publisher=VH1 | url =http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1540817/09132006/my_chemical_romance.jhtml | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-04 | language = }}</ref>

==Recording and production==
There was a month of pre-production for the album in January 2006 in [[New York]]. The band then went in March to Los Angeles to finish writing the album. Recording began in April at the El Dorado Recording Studios in [[Burbank, California]] with producer Rob Cavallo.<ref name="Warner Music">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Warner Music Australia Product: WELCOME TO THE BLACK PARADE | date= | publisher=[[Warner Music Australia]] | url =http://www.warnermusic.com.au/product,w_prod,9362429882AU | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-01 | language = }}</ref> While recording the band stayed at the [[Paramour Mansion]], an allegedly haunted mansion in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California]]. It was while staying here that the band went through a "dark period" according to lead singer [[Gerard Way]].<ref name="Blender">{{cite news | first=Andy | last=Greenwald | coauthors= | title=My Chemical Romance: Kings of Pain | date=December 2006 | publisher=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] | url =http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2283 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-01 | language = }}</ref> Bassist [[Mikey Way]] left the house to seek treatment after becoming depressed. He visited with psychologists four times a week but later returned to the house to record with the band. It was out of this dark period that the song "Famous Last Words" was written. The period after was described by Cavallo as "a snowball effect of contagious madness" as new songs were quickly written.<ref name="Blender"/>

==Musical and lyrical themes==
''The Black Parade'' is a concept album centering around the character "The Patient". It centers around his passage out of life and the memories he has of his life. "The Patient" dies young from cancer and death comes for him in the form of a parade.<ref name="NME"/><ref name="Stylus">{{cite news | first=Theon | last=Weber | coauthors= | title=My Chemical Romance - The Black Parade - Review | date=[[2006-10-24]] | publisher=[[Stylus]] | url =http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/my-chemical-romance/the-black-parade.htm/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-02 | language = }}</ref><ref name="Allmusic">{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Erlewine | coauthors= | title=The Black Parade Review | date= | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | url =http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wpfwxq8rldte~T1 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-02 | language = }}</ref> The album also expresses Gerard Way's belief that death comes for a person in the form of their fondest memory.<ref name="NME"/>

The album has been described as a classic rock tribute with influences and themes being made from 70s classic rock. Some reviewers such as Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and Ed Thompson of IGN went so far to say that the band moved from their old sound to a more classic rock sound.<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref name="IGN">{{cite news | first=Ed | last=Thompson | coauthors= | title=My Chemical Romance - The Black Parade | date= | publisher=IGN | url =http://music.ign.com/articles/741/741718p1.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-01 | language = }}</ref> Lead singer [[Gerard Way]] has cited the bands [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Pink Floyd]] as a major influence on the album.<ref name="alternative press magazine">{{cite web | title=Alternative Press Magazine | work= AP Article | url=http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g310/Stumpy_Patrick/My%20Chemical%20Romance/AParticle.jpg | accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Similarities have been noted between the [[guitar]] orchestration in "[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]", and the arrangements of Queen. Additionally, Pink Floyd's ''[[The Wall]]'' is noted as a major influence for the album, which is especially evident when comparing the album's opening track, "The End.", to the first track on ''The Wall'', [[In the Flesh?|"In the Flesh?"]].<ref name="EW.com">{{cite news | first=Clark | last=Collis | coauthors= | title=The Black Parade | date=[[2006-10-20]] | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1548441,00.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-03 | language = }}</ref>
Gerard Way has also stated that one of their biggest influences were [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], often giving credit for their thematic videos to the creativity of Billy Corgan.<ref name="Musicpix">{{cite news | first=Gwyn | last=Tyme | coauthors= | title=My Chemical Romance - Interview with Gerard Way | date= | publisher=[[Musicpix]] | url =http://www.musicpix.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=41&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-01 | language = }}</ref>

==Reception==
''The Black Parade'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. Some of the most positive reviews came from [[Allmusic]], ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', [[IGN]], and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="rolling stone"/> Dan Martin from ''NME'' compared the album to [[Green Day]]'s ''[[American Idiot (album)|American Idiot]]'', positing that "it's a piece of work that will challenge every preconception you ever had about the people who made it."<ref name="NME"/> Tim Karan of Alternative Press called ''The Black Parade'' "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of ''IGN'' stated, "''The Black Parade'' is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene."<ref name="IGN"/> David Fricke of ''Rolling Stone'' praised the classic rock feel of the album.<ref name="rolling stone"/> ''Rolling Stone'' went on to rank ''The Black Parade'' #20 in its "Top 50 Albums of 2006" feature.<ref name="rolling stone 2">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Rolling Stone : The Top 50 Albums of 2006 | date= | publisher=Rolling Stone | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12800635/the_top_50_albums_of_2006/4 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine named it the 5th best album of 2006.<ref name="Spin">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=SPIN.com: The 40 Best Albums of 2006 | date=2006-12-14 | publisher=SPIN.com | url =http://www.spin.com/features/magazine/2006/12/0601_40best/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}</ref>

''EW'' states that "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept <U+2014> a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption <U+2014> Parade stands as one of the most cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006." It ranks ''The Black Parade'' the third best record of the year, being surpassed only by Gnarls Barkley and TV on the Radio.<ref name="EW">{{cite news | first=Clark | last=Collis | coauthors= | title=EW Black Parade Review | date=2006-12-14 | publisher=ew.com | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20006509,00.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}</ref>

The album wasn't without its share of criticism, and was panned by such publications as ''[[The Observer]]'' and ''Aversion''. Stated Jamie Hodgson of ''The Observer'', "...it reeks of a band with ideas above its station."<ref name="The Observer"/> Matt Schild of ''Aversion'' thought the album was "over-the-top" and "lame".<ref name="Aversion"/> Theon Weber of ''Stylus'' praised the album's use of Queen influences, but went on to summarize the album as "...a goofy record of bubblegum punk, with Queen lapping at its edges and enough good tracks to justify the smattering of empty screamfests."<ref name="Stylus">{{cite news | first=Theon | last=Weber | coauthors= | title=My Chemical Romance - The Black Parade - Review | date= | publisher=Sylus | url =http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/my-chemical-romance/the-black-parade.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}</ref>

The album holds a 79/100 score based on 24 reviews at [[Metacritic]], which equates to the site's categorization of "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="metacritic">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance | date= | publisher=metacritic.com | url =http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/mychemicalromance/blackparade?q=the%20black%20parade | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}</ref>

==Versions==
There are three versions of ''The Black Parade'' that have the same tracks and album art. The difference between two is that one bears white text on a black background, while the other had black text on a white background. The third one features the same track listing but instead of the marching skeleton there is a picture of the parade drawn by James Jean. Inside the booklet there is also lyrics and photo of the band and characters from the album.

=== Limited edition ===
There is also a limited edition of the album. It contains the same track listing as the original release but it is sold in a box wrapped in black velveteen material. It also contains a 64-page book which contains concept art by Gerard Way and making of the album notes by the band.<ref name="amazon">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Black Parade [LIMITED EDITION] | date= | publisher=Amazon.com | url =http://www.amazon.com/Black-Parade-My-Chemical-Romance/dp/B000I2J5UG | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}</ref></blockquote>

=== Japanese version ===
The version of ''The Black Parade'' that was released in Japan contains more content than the other regular editions. It contains 14 tracks, but the 14th track contains the song "Heaven Help Us" (which was released with the single version of "[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]"), instead of the song "Blood". The Japanese version is also an [[Enhanced CD]] and has the music video of "Welcome to the Black Parade".<ref name="eil.com">{{cite web|title= My Chemical Romance The Black Parade Japan CD ALBUM (379256) | date=[[2007]] | publisher=eil.com | url =http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=379256 |accessdate= 2007-05-24}}</ref>
