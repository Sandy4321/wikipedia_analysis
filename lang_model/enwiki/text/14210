'''Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n''' (pronunciation similar to English ''machine'', but stressed on first syllable) is a [[Czechs|Czech]] family name, most often associated with Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n and his sons, Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n and Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n.
The former was a hero of Czech anti-Nazi resistance, the latter - often called the '''Masin-Brothers''' - started armed anti-Communist  resistance after the war. What made them really famous was their incredible escape through the [[Iron Curtain]], in the words of the Czech-american writer [[Jan Nov<U+00E1>k(Writer)|Jan Novak]] the [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/65857 Greatest story of the Cold War]: fleeing on foot through all the [[GDR]] to[[West Berlin]], thousands of East German policeman and [[Soviet]] troops  were not able to catch them.
Outside of the Czech and Slovak communities at home and abroad, this story is almost forgotten.

[[image:General_Masin.jpg|left|thumb|80px|General Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n]]
'''Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n''' ([[August 26]] [[1896]], [[Lo<U+0161>any]] near [[Kol<U+00ED>n]] <U+2013> [[June 30]] [[1942]], [[Prague]]) was an army officer of [[Czechoslovakia]] and member of the [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|underground resistance]] against the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. 

Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n was a member of the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] fighting in Russia (1916<U+2013>1921) and later an officer in the Czechoslovak Army. After the [[occupation of Czechoslovakia]] by Nazi Germany he, together with [[Josef Balab<U+00E1>n]] and [[V<U+00E1>clav Mor<U+00E1>vek]], formed a resistance group concentrated on intelligence gathering and sabotage. 
While more resistance groups existed, this one, aptly named ''[[Three Kings (Czech antinazi rezistance)|Tri Kr<U+00E1>lov<U+00E9>]]'' (''Three Kings''), is the most known among the Czech public.
Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n was captured by the [[Gestapo]] on May 13, 1941. After being tortured, he twice attempted suicide. As part of the German retaliatory measures for the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] he was executed. His wife was imprisoned for several months.

After the war, Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n was medalled and promoted to General. His sons - then 13 and 15 years old - got Medals for "personal bravery during the war" from president [[Edvard Benes]].

[[image:Josef_Masin_1950.jpg|left|thumb|80px|Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n]]
His sons '''Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n''' (b. [[August 11]], [[1930]], Prague) and '''Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n''' (b. [[March 8]], [[1932]], Prague) are known for their armed resistance against the [[Communist state|communist]] regime in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s.

=== The resistance group and its actions ===

Following World War II, Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's sons attended a high school in [[Podebrady]]. After the Communist seize of power, they witnessed how some of their families friends - opponents of the regime - were silenced, vanished without a trace or were sentenced to death on public show trials. For instance [[Milada Hor<U+00E1>kov<U+00E1>]], a famous early judicial murder victim, had been a friend of their mother's.
The Masins shared the idea that the Americans, who had helped to establish the Czechoslovakian state, would soon come and "wipe out Communism". The radio stations "[[Radio Free Europe]]" (RFE) and "[[Voice Of America]]" (VOA) seemed to promise an imminent invasion. Therefore they formed a military resistance group with a few friends. The Masin-Brothers' uncle '''Ctibor Novak''', a former Secret Service Officer, became an adviser of the group. One source says that Novak had actually put up with the fact of Communist rule and was satisfied if the Communists didn't bother him. He engaged in the group mainly because he hoped he could control his hot-tempered nephews and prevent them from doing the most dangerous actions. But that was just his defense strategy when he was on trial in 1954. Indeed he was very supportive and encouraged the brother's actions.
Except for the brothers and Novak, no member of the "group without a name" new the names of all other members of the group.
 
The following actions of the group are documented:

In 1951 the group raided two police stations in order to get weapons and ammunition. Each time a policeman was killed. Other witnesses of the assaults were chloroformed, but left alive.

Since it was becoming increasingly difficult to conduct actions, the brothers decided to go West. Their goal was to get some real training in partisan warfare techniques from the Americans. They believed a shooting war was imminent, and they wanted to return to Czechoslovakia in the vanguard of the liberating western armies. A first escape attempt failed when a CIC agent who was supposed to accompany them was arrested by the Czechoslovak Secret Service [[StB] and talked. He named Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n. Shortly after the brothers und their uncle were arrested by the StB and subjected to what is today euphemistically called "[[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation|extended interrogation techniques]]". The StB guys never found out that they had seized the men responsible for the police station raids. Josef Masin and his uncle were released after a few months. 

Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n was sentenced to 2 years slave labor for the crime of knowing about someone else's planned escape but not reporting it. He was sent to work in  an [[uranium]] mine near [[Jachymov]] ''(Joachimsthal)''. Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n states that this time in the Czechoslovak equivalent of the [[Gulag]] made him even more determined to fight the regime. 

During Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's imprisonment the others attacked a payroll transport and obtained 846,000 [[Czechoslovak Crown|Czechoslovak crowns]]. one of the car's occupants raised his pistol against Josef Masin and was shot.

After Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's release, the group stole 4 chests of altogether 100 kg of donarit explosives from a quarry. They planned to blow up a uranium train with these explosives, or possibly President Gottwald's personal train.

The last action before their escape was the "Night of Great Fires". In several [[Moravian]] villages V<U+00E1>clav <U+0160>v<U+00E9>da and Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n placed [[incendiary composition]] with [[time fuse]]s into straw stacks. They all lit up in the middle of the night. The action was a protest against the Socialist collectivization of agriculture. At that time, even straw was in short supply, so the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns intension was not only spreading "shock and awe" but really harming the economy of the agricultural collectives. A firefighter was gunned down. While one source states he died with one bullet in his eye and one in his lungs, most others mention only 3 casualties in Czechoslovakia which means he must have survived.

=== Through the courtain ===
In October, 1953 the group made a second attempt to escape to the West. Radio Free Europe broadcasts made it sound like World War III was imminent, and the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns and their friends wanted to take part in the invasion.
They stress that the police still had no leads on their actions, therefore the danger of being arrested was not a reason for their escape.
In the night from the 3rd to the 4th of October '''Zbyn<U+011B>k Janata''', '''V<U+00E1>clav <U+0160>v<U+00E9>da''', '''Milan Paumer''' and the Masin brothers crossed the border to [[East Germany]] near [[Deutschkatharinenberg]] ''([[Hora Sv. Kateriny]])'' in order to get to the western part of [[Berlin]].

West Berlin was kind of a last hole in the Iron Curtain. The [[Berlin Wall]] was not erect yet, numerous streets and footpathes, [[tram]]s and [[suburban train]]s connected the parts of the divided city. The border guards could not manage to check the identity of every passenger. So there was a chance for the five to reach their destination without being discovered - esspecially because their names and their activities where not yet known to the East German Police.
After three days of walking trough the cold they tried to highjack a car. The attempt failed, but now the police started searching for "five armed foreigners".
The fugitives made another mistake taking a train which they thought would bring them closer to Berlin. But on the train they misunderstood an announcement that the train would go back to were they started from.

[[image:Train_Station_Luckau_Uckro.jpg|thumb|right|Train Station Luckau-Uckro]]
The next time they took a train ended in a disaster: the women who sold the tickets informed the police about some "suspicious foreigners". At Uckro station (today: Luckau-Uckro) the police waited for the train and checked the passengers. The group started shooting, killing one cop and injuring to others.
The policeman in charge, hit by 6 bullets, quit his job when the head of the Volkpolizei held him responsible for the Masin brothers finally making it to the West.

Shortly after that incident Zbyn<U+011B>k Janata, separated from the others, was caught. Only after interrogating him and consulting Czech authorities the police knew who they had to do with. Now the greatest manhunt of the Volkspolizei ''(literally: People's Police)'' started. After finding and loosing the tracks of the refugees over and over again, more and more troops where ordered to support the manhunt.  
East Germany did not have an army by that time - there was only a predecessor of the East German Army, the so called "Kasernierte Volkspolizei" (''Baracked People's Police''). Therefore Soviet troops where asked for assistance. 

Eventually thousands of people hunted four anti-Communists. Right after the arrival in West Berlin, western newspapers wrote of "20,000 Vopos"  (''Vopo'' stands for "Volkspolizei cop"). '''Wolfgang Mittmann''' (1939-2006), a true crime author and former member of the Volkspolizei states that according to the final report there where only 5,000 policemen involved in the manhunt - plus troops of the Secret Service plus troops of the [[Red Army]]. Their number does not appear in the police files, but it's very unlikely that they send more troops than the authority that was actually in charge.
Barbara Masin assumes that the number of 5,000 was a first attempt by East German officialdom to minimize the manhunt and the scope of the humiliation. 

Altogether three pursuers were shot by the group. At least three more died in [[friendly fire]].

At '''Waldow''', about 100 km from Berlin, the group was encircled. They waited for the night and then managed to run through the encirclement. The next day V<U+00E1>clav <U+0160>v<U+00E9>da, hurt by a stray bullet, surrendered and was eventually found by the police.

Several times the police was called upon rumours that someone had seen the Czechs. Many of the troops where unexperienced young man who had joined the armed forces only weeks or months before. They did not get any official information from their officers, therefore rumours spread in which the Czechs became [[Rambo]]s who had killed countless pursuers. 
Therefore the troops, whenever assuming the fugitives around, shot at "anything and everything that moved" and afterwards wrote into their reports that they had fired at the Czechs but missed them. As a result, one can find gun battles at places that the fugitives never passed in the police files.
Besides the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns, after arriving in the West, consciously changed some details of their story in order to protect people who had helped them. They for instance claimed they had crossed the [[autobahn]] between [[Berlin]] and [[Dresden]] after the Waldow battle and found refuge at a family in "Sch<U+00F6>nwalde". Though there were people in Sch<U+00F6>nwalde who "remembered" the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns' visit, several researchers found out that they never made it there: the highway was under permanent surveillance, passing it was simply impossible. '''Gerald Endres''' director of a German documentary [http://de.nntp2http.com/alt/folklore/ddr/2006/08/ba9bdd169836808dc1d12d99df6a128b.html claimed] he found the place and the family where they had really stayed after the Waldow battle. Even 50 years later they wouldn't talk about that: According to them the lokal authorities were still the same and they still feared their revenge!

On 4th of November the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns and Paumer reached their destination: Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n under the floor of a suburban train, Milan Paumer and Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n somehow managed to pass the border on foot.

=== Afterwards ===

Back in Czechoslovakia people who had any association with the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns received harsh treatment. V<U+00E1>clav <U+0160>v<U+00E9>da Zbyn<U+011B>k Janata and Ctibor Novak were sentenced to death and executed. Other friends and relatives were sentenced to many years of imprisonment. The Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns' mother, '''Zdena  Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>nov<U+00E1>''' who was not involved at all in the military resistance of her sons, died in prison on June 12, 1956. Even the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns little sister - her name also '''Zdena  Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>nov<U+00E1>''' (*1933) was jailed. Today she is an [[icon]] for the Czech anti-Communist movement. 

[[image:Ctirad_Masin_USArmy.jpg|left|thumb|80px|"Ray" Masin]]
[[image:Josef_Masin_USArmy.jpg|left|thumb|80px|"Joe" Masin]]
In East Germany, whose armed forces had been humiliated, the manhunt was brushed under the carpet. 
In Czechoslovakia communist propaganda made full use of the the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's actions, describing them as looters and brutal murderers of innocent passers-by. Their actions were used to justify tight control over the society and brutal treatment of any opponents.

The fugitives moved to the United States and served in the U. S. Army Special Forces at [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]] for 5 years. Milan Paumer fought in [[Korean War|Korea]]. 
In the 60s, Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n jr settled down in [[Cologne]], [[West Germany]]. The Czechoslovak Security Service [[StB]] several times planned to kidnap or kill him. Later he moved to the USA again. Both the brothers still live there and refuse to enter Czech soil again unless the are fully rehabilitated. 
In 2001, Milan Paumer sold his home in Florida and moved back to [[Podebrady]].
<br style="clear:both" />

=== Current disputes ===
After the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of socialism]] in Czechoslovakia (1989), the oppression and crimes of communist party have been revealed and condemned and people sentenced during this era are generally seen as innocent victims. The Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns became the most disputed exceptions.

The armed resistance after 1948 was very small (compared to that of neighbouring countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]]) and killings were uncommon. Ota Rambousek's book "Jenom ne strach" (see below) was published in Czechoslovakia in 1990 and realistic descriptions of how the brothers killed a cashier or how they cut the throat of disarmed policeman disabled by [[chloroform]] didn't fit well into "velvet" mood of Czechs.

Even 15 years later the case of Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns is able to deeply divide Czech public into two groups: one seeing them as heroes, another abhorring such brutal murderers. Politicians in the Czech Republic occasionally face uneasy problem of taking a clear stand on the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns.

In contrast to the inhabitants of the Czech and Slovak Republics, the majority of the expatriates - familiar with the experience of fleeing to the West at the risk of one's life - seem to be Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n admirers: in 2005, the [[Czech and Slovak Association of Canada]] gave the Thomas-Masaryk-Award to the Masin-Brothers and Milan Paumer.

=== Versions of the Story ===
Various fictional and documentary versions of the Masin-Brothers' story exist. The authors of most of them cannot be considered as neutral. Therefore an overview of the existing literature shall be given.
According to Barbara Masin, three propaganda books on the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns were published in Czechoslovakia. The last one, "Mrtv<U+00ED> nemluv<U+00ED>" ''(Dead do not talk)'' was translated into German and published in the GDR in 1989, a few months before the end of Socialism. 
Surprisingly the book does not claim the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns where American spies. Their activities are described as a kind of personal retaliation upon the Communist government by frustrated high-society kids. The book of course doesn't mention the penalties against the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns' family and friends.

Besides the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns had to serve as culprits in one episode of the famous detective series "Major Zeman". In contrast to reality, "Major Zeman" caught them. 
The Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns theirselves, after losing the illusion that the West would wage war to end Communism in Eastern Europe, were reluctant to talk about their past. Eventually another expatriate made them tell their story again: '''Ota Rambousek''' (*1923, [[Prague]]) had been a political prisoner in Czechoslavakia. While many people sat in East European jails accused of being American spies, Rambousek was one of the few who were not innocent: He had indeed been an agent of the US [[Counter Intelligence Corps]]. First he was sentenced to death, later his death sentence was commuted to lifetime imprisonment. In jail he heard about the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns, whose story had become a kind of an Heroic Saga for the prisoners. In 1968 he cleared and moved to the USA. Only in 1984 Rambousek managed to meet the brothers in New York and wrote his novel "Jenom ne strach" ''(Just no fear)''. The Czech expatriate publishing house ''68 publishers'' in Toronto refused to publish the book. Some Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n admirers swear that [[Vaclav Havel]], former fellow student of the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns at [[Podebrady]] high school prevented the book from being printed. Eventually it was published in Prague after the [[Velvet Revolution]]. 1987 [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasted a series of interviews with Ctirad Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n by Ota Rambousek. As Eastern archives were not open yet, the book and the interviews were based only on the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns' memories and on what they read about the manhunt in the newspapers after arriving in West Berlin. They contain the "Sch<U+00F6>nwalde Fake" (see above) and wrongly claim the group shot four instead of three Volkspolizei cops: Western press had copied from East German propaganda which had added one of the friendly fire casualties to the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's victims. 

In East Germany, Wolfgang Mittmann (1939-2006), policeman and true crime writer, rediscovered the manhunt in the 80s.
He states that he found the names of four killed policemen, assassinated near the town where he lived, which were not mentioned in the official chronicle of the Volkspolizei. He - maybe after getting some hints from older colleages or hearing local rumours - started interviewing people around and found them reluctant to talk about the "Czech's War". As long as the GDR existed, the files on the manhunt were top secret. Mittmann went to Prague where he got a "pirate copy" of the [[RFE]] interviews, made by employees of Prague Broadcasting Service, studied exhibits of the Prague Police Museum, which included the Czech police records on the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's police station raids and also viewed the inheritance of the late author of "Mrtv<U+00ED> nemluv<U+00ED>" ''(Dead do not talk)''. Only after the [[Reunification of Germany]] - Mittmann had retired and writing had become his full-time job - he could read the German files as well as Rambousek's book.
For Mittmann the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns were killers. A policeman cannot be expected to honor shots at colleagues. He accused Rambousek and the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns to consciously play down the actions in the Czechoslovak Republic.
Mittmann's critics say, he never questioned police files. Whatever he found in them, he considered as the truth. Also he hardly saw political reasons for the vast number of troops involved in the manhunt. For him this overreaction was due to the ambitions of a single person, Chefinspekteur ''(Lieutentant General)'' '''Willi Seifert''', proxy of the head of the Volkspolizei, who wanted to catch the "fascist bandits", no matter what the cost.

After reading Mittmann's report, two German journalists decided to find and interview the Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>ns if possible. Their documentary "Der Luckauer Krieg" ''(The Luckau War)'' met with severe criticism because they "displayed murderers as heroes". This was probably similar to the Czech public reaction to "Jenom ne strach".

In 2004 the Czech-american writer [[Jan Novak (Writer)|Jan Novak]] (not related to '''Ctibor Novak''') wrote a biographical novel on the father's and the sons' stories. Its title: "So far so good" ''(Zatim Dobry)''. It won the coveted Magnesia Litera "book of the year" award in Czechia. Although Novak wrote in English, only the Czech Edition is available so far. The Czech film maker [[Ivan Passer]] (a former classmate of Joseph Masin's and of [[Milos Forman]]'s) announced he is going to make a movie based on the book. 

Last not least, Barbara Masin, Josef Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n's daughter researched several years in Germany, the USA and the Czech Republic to reconstruct the story of her family. The English edition of her book "Gauntlet" has just been published in the USA.
