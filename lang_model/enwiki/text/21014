Nine Inch Nails live performances have typically been accompanied by visual elements such as stage lighting, projection, video displays, and specially designed lighting fixtures.  These visual elements have been designed by Reznor and [[Rob Sheridan]] among others.

The live band lineup has tended to change drastically between major tours and releases, though band members have occasionally participated in the process of recording new material.  Aside from Reznor as lead vocals and guitar, no member of the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cites the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes.<ref>{{cite episode

The [[Nine Inch Nails discography]] includes three releases featuring the live band: ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' (1997), ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' (2002), and ''[[Beside You in Time]]'' (2007), all of which feature the live band in various incarnations and in the midst of various tours.

In the studio, most if not all of each Nine Inch Nails release is performed entirely by Trent Reznor.  On stage and on tour, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret the songs in a live form. Keyboardist [[Alessandro Cortini]] said that "If you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity."<ref name="Wigney" />

Despite first touring in 1988, Nine Inch Nails has only embarked on five major tours, typically with a long hiatus in between.  Though early tours were primarily played in North America, more recent tours, beginning with the final leg of the ''Pretty Hate Machine'' tour in 1991, have spanned the globe, including concerts in South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, and China.

During the band's earliest tours, Nine Inch Nails opened for bands such as [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]], and [[Guns N' Roses]].  More recently, Nine Inch Nails has been supported by musical acts such as [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[A Perfect Circle]], [[Atari Teenage Riot]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], and [[The Dresden Dolls]].  Since those early tours, Nine Inch Nails has headlined the majority of their concerts, including performances at [[Lollapalooza]], [[Woodstock '94]], [[Alternative Nation Festival]], and [[Big Day Out]].

The first live band was assembled to support Skinny Puppy on several dates, and was composed of what a ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'' article described as [[session musician]]s. The band was apparently poorly received, and they were asked to leave the tour after 10 dates.

In 1990, Nine Inch Nails toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] and later [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web

After the 1994 release of ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', the live band embarked on the Self-Destruct tour in support of the album.  Vrenna and Woolley returned from the previous tour on drums and keyboards respectively, [[Robin Finck]] replaced Richard Patrick on guitar, and the band added bassist [[Danny Lohner]].  The tour included a mud-drenched performance at [[Woodstock '94]], which  was broadcast on [[Pay-per-view]] and seen in as many as 24 million homes.<ref>{{cite journal

The main leg of the tour featured [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] as the supporting act, who Reznor had signed to his [[Nothing Records]] label.  At the time, Marilyn Manson featured guitarist [[Jeordie White]] (playing under the pseudonym "Twiggy Ramirez"), who would later play guitar with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.  After another tour leg supporting the remix album ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', Nine Inch Nails contributed to the [[Alternative Nation Festival]] in Australia.  Following the three-date alternative music festival, Nine Inch Nails embarked on a 26-date tour with co-headliner [[David Bowie]].  During the tour, Nine Inch Nails would perform first, and their set would segway seamlessly into Bowie's.<ref name="Dissonance 1">{{cite web

A five-year touring hiatus followed the Fragility tour, until 2005 when the band toured in support of Nine Inch Nails' newest album, ''[[With Teeth]]''.  The previous live band had almost completely dissolved: only Jerome Dillon remained.  To find replacements, Reznor held open auditions in Los Angeles.<ref name="Times Square">{{cite web

The ''Year Zero'' project also included an [[alternate reality game]] of [[Year Zero (alternate reality game)|the same name]], with much of the game revolving around a number of live performances.

===2008 and beyond===
In September 2007 the ''Honolulu Star-Bulletin'' reported that the September 18 show in Honolulu, Hawaii, would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor was quoted as stating, "at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. I don't want it to go stale."<ref name="break-up" />  In the same article, Reznor also admitted that "The idea of five guys playing loud music two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down."<ref name="break-up" />

==Live band members==
Since first touring in 1988, no member of the Nine Inch Nails live band has remained consistent except for Reznor himself.  The configuration of the band has also evolved greatly: early incarnations of the band were a three-piece band featuring [[guitar]]s, [[drum]]s, [[keyboard]]s, and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]].  Later incarnations replaced the keyboards and samplers with an additional guitarist, and still later incarnations added a [[bass guitar]]ist, until finally settling on a five-piece band during the ''Self Destruct'' tour.  In September 2007, Reznor expressed his interest in moving away from the "rock band configuration" of previous Nine Inch Nails live performances, to explore "other ways [to] present the material in concert."<ref name="break-up" />

Between major tours, live band members have on occasion contributed instrumental performances to official Nine Inch Nails releases, though creative control and direction has always been with Reznor.  Live band members who have contributed to major Nine Inch Nails releases are presented in italics below.

Since 1999, the visual design of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been created by [[Rob Sheridan]].  Nine Inch Nails shows typically feature a large amount of [[strobe light]]s,<ref name="unogateway">{{cite news

[[Bill Viola]] designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour.<ref name="Gergiev" />  The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery.  The DVD release of ''And All That Could Have Been'', a tour documentary of the Fragility tour, features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.<ref name="AATCHB DVD review" />

Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design, respectively, of the Live: With Teeth tour.<ref name="WT lighting">{{cite journal

  | publisher = ''Projection, Lights and Staging News''
  | last = Steve

  | date = [[2005-12-08]]}}</ref>  Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that the much of the lighting was done using a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LED lights]] arranged in "stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork."  Also used were [[DLP]] projectors displayed on a gauze screen in front of the stage.  Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillip, Reznor, and Sheridan devised a "gag" where they projected "a sheet of glass shattering onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell.  ... We settled on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze [and] shattering it, but with all the pieces falling up as the [screen] flew out."<ref name="WT lighting" />  This particular trick can be seen in the tour documentary ''Beside You in Time''.

In contrast to the lighting of the Live: With Teeth tour, Performance 2007 featured minimalist lighting that shadowed Reznor.<ref>{{cite news

==Guest artists and collaborations==
Through the years, Reznor has invited many prominent musicians on stage with his band to perform material outside the usual range of Nine Inch Nails songs:

*During [[Lollapalooza]] '91, one of the first exposures the band ever had to a wider audience than its previously [[underground music|underground]] following, [[Jane's Addiction]] members [[Dave Navarro]] and [[Eric Avery]] played guitars alongside [[Gibby Haynes]] and [[Ice-T]] for the last song of the band's set, "[[Head Like a Hole]]".<ref>{{cite web

* During the Dissonance tour, Nine Inch Nails co-headlined with [[David Bowie]].  Throughout the tour, Nine Inch Nails would perform first and segway into Bowie's band.  The two bands would play a mixture of Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie songs.  Nine Inch Nails would eventually leave the stage and Bowie and his band would continue with their own set.<ref name="Dissonance 1" /><ref name="Dissonance 2" />
* During the Live: With Teeth amphitheater tour, Nine Inch Nails and [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] of [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] performed the [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]] song "[[Final Solution (disambiguation)|Final Solution]]", which was also a solo hit for Murphy. For the last show they collaborated to cover [[Joy Division]]'s "Dead Souls", which Nine Inch Nails has regularly played since 1994.  Also during this tour Reznor, Murphy, and some other musicians performed four unique sets of their favorite songs on radio stations around the country.<ref>{{cite web
