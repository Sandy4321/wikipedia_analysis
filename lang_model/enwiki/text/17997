'''Quirigu<U+00E1>''' is an ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] in the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Izabal Department|Izabal]] in south-eastern [[Guatemala]]. It is a medium-sized site covering approximately {{convert|3|km2|sqmi}} along the lower [[Motagua River]],<ref>Ashmore 1980, p.24.</ref> with the ceremonial center about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from the north bank.<ref name="Sharer352"/> During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Maya Classic Period]] (AD 200&ndash;900), Quirigu<U+00E1> was situated at the point where several important [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] came together. The site was occupied by 200, construction on the [[acropolis]] had begun by about 550, and an explosion of grander construction started in the 8th century. All construction had halted by about 850, except for a brief period of reoccupation in the Early [[Postclassic]] (''c''. 900 &ndash; ''c''. 1200). Quirigu<U+00E1> shares its architectural and sculptural styles with the nearby Classic Period city of [[Cop<U+00E1>n]], with whose history it is closely entwined.<ref>Miller 1999, p.49.</ref>

Quirigu<U+00E1>'s rapid expansion in the 8th century was tied to king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]]'s military victory over Cop<U+00E1>n in 738. When the greatest king of Cop<U+00E1>n, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] or "18-Rabbit", was defeated, he was captured and then sacrificed in the Great Plaza at Quirigu<U+00E1>.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.4&ndash;5, 83.</ref> Before this, Quirigu<U+00E1> had been a [[vassal state]] of Cop<U+00E1>n, but it maintained its independence afterwards. The ceremonial [[Maya architecture|architecture]] at Quirigu<U+00E1> is quite modest, but the site's importance lies in its wealth of sculpture, including the tallest stone [[monumental sculpture|monuments]] ever erected in the [[New World]].<ref name="Coe121"/>

==Name and location==
[[Image:Larger Southern Maya area v3.svg|thumb|350px|right|alt=Map showing the locations of Quirigu<U+00E1> and Cop<U+00E1>n in the extreme east of the region, with Quirigu<U+00E1> to the north and Cop<U+00E1>n directly south.

[[Image:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|350px|thumb|right|alt=Map showing Quirigu<U+00E1>'s location at the eastern end of the Motagua drainage and showing a tight cluster of jade sources upriver to the west. The landmass is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the southwest.|The location of Quirigu<U+00E1> on the Motagua River, with relation to sources of jade]]

The archaeological site of Quirigu<U+00E1> is named after the nearby village of the same name,<ref>Looper 2003, viii.</ref> and located a little over {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Guatemala City]];<ref>Stross et al. 1983, p.333.</ref> it lies in the municipality of [[Los Amates]] in the department of Izabal and has an elevation of {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref>Inforpress.</ref>

Positioned on the north bank of the lower reaches of the [[Motagua River]], Quirigu<U+00E1> is situated at the point where the valley broadens into a [[flood plain]], which has exposed the site to periodic flooding over the centuries.<ref name="Loop1"/><ref name="Loop35">Looper 2003, p.35.</ref> Although the river passed close to the site during the period of the city's occupation, it has since changed course and now flows {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} south of the ceremonial centre.<ref name="Sharer352"/> Quirigu<U+00E1> is {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Cop<U+00E1>n,<ref name="Coe121"/> and located {{convert|15.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of the international border with [[Honduras]].

The local [[bedrock]] is a hard red [[sandstone]], which the inhabitants used in the construction of monuments and [[Mesoamerican architecture|architecture]]. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to [[Shear (geology)|shearing]] or [[Fracture (geology)|fracturing]], and allowed the sculptors at Quirigu<U+00E1> to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas.<ref>Miller 1999, p.82.</ref> Quirigu<U+00E1> was built directly over the [[Motagua Fault]] and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major [[earthquake]]s.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.507.</ref>

==Population==
Although the Quirigu<U+00E1> elite were clearly Maya in ethnicity,<ref>Looper 1999, p.264.</ref> the site lies on the southern periphery of the [[Mesoamerica]]n area and the population was at least bi-ethnic,<ref name="Sheets442">Sheets 2000, p.442.</ref> with [[Maya people|ethnic Maya]] in a minority.<ref name="Loop1"/> The majority of the population belonged ethnically to the less complex [[Intermediate Area]] lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica.<ref name="Sheets442"/> The [[population density]] of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]]<ref>Drew 1999, p.344.</ref> with an estimated peak population of 1200&ndash;1600;<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.688.</ref> surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km<sup>2</sup> (3767 per square mile) in central Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.686.</ref> The low population density indicates that Quirigu<U+00E1> served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.<ref name="Loop1">Looper 2003, p.1.</ref>

The population levels of the Quirigu<U+00E1> valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Cop<U+00E1>n in 738, although it was never a heavily populated site.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.219.</ref> In the 9th century there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the abandonment of the city.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.225.</ref>

==Economy==
The Motagua River flows down from the western [[Guatemalan Highlands|Guatemalan highlands]], and Quirigu<U+00E1> was ideally positioned to control the trade of uncut [[jade]], the majority of which was found in the middle reaches of the Motagua Valley,<ref name="Miller54">Miller 1999, p.54.</ref> as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as [[cacao]], which was produced as a local [[cash crop]].<ref name="Drew240">Drew 1999, p.240.</ref><ref name="Loop2"/> Although cacoa was produced for trade, maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the [[Maya cuisine|Maya diet]].<ref name="Ash111">Ashmore 2007, p.111.</ref> In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site's tribute payments to its overlords at Cop<U+00E1>n, a city that was exhausting its own local resources.<ref name="Ash111"/> Although little jade has actually been recovered from the site, there is evidence for [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|trade in obsidian]] originating from the [[Ixtepeque]] source situated near the upper reaches of the Motagua.<ref name="Loop2"/><ref>Stross ''et al.'' 1983, p.335.</ref>

In the Classic Period, the location of the site would have placed Quirigu<U+00E1> on a crossroads between the trading route from the highlands to the Caribbean coast and the route from Cop<U+00E1>n to the major cities of the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin]].<ref name="Loop2">Looper 2003, p.2.</ref>

==Known rulers==
{{Maya civilization}}
As recorded on hieroglyphic inscriptions at Quirigu<U+00E1>, all dates are AD. Maya inscriptions for rulers sometimes include reference to a number ("''hel''-number" or count, named after its main glyph) that are believed to specify the position of that ruler in the sequence of dynastic succession to the rulership of the site. Thus a ''hel''-number of five indicates the ruler was 5th in the line of dynastic succession.<ref>Jones 1983, p.122</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[Image:QuiriguaStelaDNorth.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A tall, narrow monument with the prominent sculpture of a king surrounded by elaborate decoration.|Stela D&nbsp;&ndash; North face]]
There is evidence that Quirigu<U+00E1> was occupied as early as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] (400 BC &ndash; AD 200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been recovered, including 63 [[figurine]]s and a [[chert]] blade.<ref name="Loop35"/> Early Classic [[Ceramic art|ceramics]] from Quirigu<U+00E1> are similar to finds at both Cop<U+00E1>n and [[Chalchuapa]] in [[El Salvador]], while jade hunchback figurines from the same period resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands. These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quirigu<U+00E1> in the wider southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards.<ref>Looper 2003, p.38.</ref>

A combination of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal, Cop<U+00E1>n and Quirigu<U+00E1>, together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the Cop<U+00E1>n dynasty all suggest that Quirigu<U+00E1> and Cop<U+00E1>n were founded by elite colonists from the great city of [[Tikal]] as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.333.</ref><ref>Sharer ''et al.'' 2005, p.196.</ref><ref>Looper 2003, pp.37<U+2013>38.</ref> The recorded history of Quirigu<U+00E1> starts in 426, in the Early Classic (''c''.200 &ndash; ''c''. 600); according to [[hieroglyph]]ic [[Maya script|inscriptions]] at other sites, on 5&nbsp;September of that year [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']] was enthroned as king of Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.192.</ref> Just three days later he installed "Tok Casper", the first known king of Quirigu<U+00E1>, upon the throne.<ref name="MG216"/> From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history Quirigu<U+00E1> was subservient to its southern neighbour, and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Cop<U+00E1>n and, indirectly, of Tikal.<ref name="MG216"/> During the next few centuries, about which little is known, the ceremonial architecture at Quirigu<U+00E1> was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor.<ref name="MG216"/> It is recorded that a [[stela]], as yet unfound, was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K'inich, the second king of Quirigu<U+00E1>.<ref name="MG217">Martin & Grube 2000, p.217.</ref> An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Cop<U+00E1>n, demonstrating Quirigu<U+00E1>'s continued status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quirigu<U+00E1> but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult.<ref name="MG217"/>

There are close parallels between the 5th-century architecture and monuments of Quirigu<U+00E1> and [[Uaxactun]] in the northern Pet<U+00E9>n, a site that fell under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century. The similarities show that Quirigu<U+00E1> remained strongly aligned with the great Tikal alliance network.<ref name="Loop50">Looper 2003, p.50.</ref>

===Hiatus and recovery===
Quirigu<U+00E1> suffered a hiatus from the turn of the 6th century that lasted through to the middle of the 7th century. This may be linked to the [[Tikal#Tikal hiatus|Tikal hiatus]] of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by [[Calakmul]]. There is evidence that Quirigu<U+00E1> suffered an attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument&nbsp;26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.<ref name="Loop50"/>

In the 6th or early 7th century a natural disaster caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried the surface of the site under a deep layer of [[silt]], completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, and it was one of the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quirigu<U+00E1>, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.<ref name="MG217"/>

A revival can be identified by the dedication of the first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king K'awiil Yopaat in 653. Continued contact with Cop<U+00E1>n is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with [[Caracol]] in [[Belize]]. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the [[acropolis]], including the building of the site's first [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].<ref>Looper 2003, pp.50<U+2013>53.</ref>

===Apogee===
Quirigu<U+00E1> had traditionally been subordinate to its southern neighbour, Cop<U+00E1>n, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Cop<U+00E1>n, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quirigu<U+00E1>'s throne as his vassal.<ref name="Drew241"/><ref name="Loop79"/> However, as early as 734, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown that he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Cop<U+00E1>n when he started to refer to himself as ''k'ul [[ajaw|ahaw]]'', holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ''ahaw'', subordinate lord; at the same time he began to use his own Quirigu<U+00E1> [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|emblem glyph]].<ref name="Drew241">Drew 1999, p.241.</ref> These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quirigu<U+00E1> had managed to form an external alliance.<ref name="Drew241"/> 

[[Image:Quirigua Stela C.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A stela with the prominent sculpture of a king surrounded by elaborate decoration. The monument is covered by a thatched roof supported on wooden poles.|Stela C, south face, representing K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat<ref>Looper 2003, pp.158, 184.</ref>]]

Indeed, this local act of rebellion appears to have been part of the larger political struggle between the two Maya "superpowers", the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul. In 736, only two years later, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat received a visit from Wamaw K'awiil, the high king of distant Calakmul, while Cop<U+00E1>n was one of Tikal's oldest allies. The timing of this visit by the king of Calakmul is highly significant, falling between the accession of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to the throne of Quirigu<U+00E1> as a vassal of Cop<U+00E1>n and the outright rebellion that was to follow. This strongly suggests that Calakmul sponsored Quirigu<U+00E1>'s rebellion in order to weaken Tikal and to gain access to the rich trade route of the Motagua Valley.<ref name="Loop79">Looper 2003, p.79.</ref><ref name="Sharer482"/> It is likely that contact with Calakmul had been initiated soon after K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat acceded to the throne, since Quirigu<U+00E1> experienced rapid growth soon after, suggesting that Quirigu<U+00E1> was already receiving external support.<ref name="Loop79"/>

In 738 the interlinked fortunes of Quirigu<U+00E1> and Cop<U+00E1>n took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quirigu<U+00E1>, captured the powerful but elderly 13th king of Cop<U+00E1>n, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil,<ref name="Web300">Webster 2002, p.300.</ref> who had installed him on his throne in 725.<ref name="Drew240"/> This coup does not seem to have physically affected either Cop<U+00E1>n or Quirigu<U+00E1>, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute.<ref>Drew 1999, p.286.</ref><ref name="Loop78"/> Quirigu<U+00E1> seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes.<ref>Drew 1999, p.286.</ref> An inscription at Quirigu<U+00E1>, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quirigu<U+00E1> seized and burned the wooden images of Cop<U+00E1>n's patron [[deity|deities]].<ref name="Loop78"/> All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|Maya deities]] were often carried into battle on [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquins]], facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Cop<U+00E1>n was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]], and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quirigu<U+00E1> warriors.<ref name="Loop78">Looper 2003, p.78.</ref>

The captured lord was taken back to Quirigu<U+00E1> and on 3 May 738 he was ritually decapitated.<ref name="Miller1345"/><ref name="Loop76"/> The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quirigu<U+00E1> and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quirigu<U+00E1> as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region.<ref name="Drew241"/><ref name="Loop76">Looper 2003, p.76.</ref> After this, Quirigu<U+00E1> engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely mimicking the sculptural style of Cop<U+00E1>n, possibly using captured Cop<U+00E1>n sculptors to carry out the work.<ref name="Miller1345">Miller 1999, pp.134&ndash;35.</ref> The population of Quirigu<U+00E1> and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although Quirigu<U+00E1> was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.219. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.688.</ref>

[[Image:Quirigua Altar M.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Stone sculpture shaped like the head of an animal looking to the left|Altar M, dating to 734. It has been identified variously as a feline, a crocodile and a snake. It may actually be a three-dimensional representation of a rare [[wikt:toponym|toponymic]] glyph<ref>Looper 2003, pp.58<U+2013>61.</ref>]]
In the Late Classic (''c''. 600 &ndash; ''c'' .900), alliance with Calakmul was frequently associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Cop<U+00E1>n, a much more powerful city than Quirigu<U+00E1>, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quirigu<U+00E1> that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Cop<U+00E1>n. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quirigu<U+00E1> gained its independence.<ref>Looper 1999, p.271.</ref><ref>Looper 2003, p.81.</ref>

In 718, the city of Xkuy&nbsp;<U+2013> an as yet undiscovered site&nbsp;<U+2013> was attacked and burned by Cop<U+00E1>n under the leadership of king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. After the king of Cop<U+00E1>n was sacrificed in 738, Xkuy seems to have become a loyal vassal of Quirigu<U+00E1> and in 762 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat supervised the accession of "Sunraiser Jaguar" to the subservient city's throne.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, pp.203, 221.</ref>

K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who had so dramatically changed the destiny of his city, died on 27 July 785. [[Zoomorph]] G is his memorial stone and describes how he was buried 10 days later in the ''13 Kawak House'', a building that has not yet been identified. The great king was succeeded by "Sky Xul", a king whose name has not yet been properly identified. "Sky Xul" became the reigning lord of Quirigu<U+00E1> 78 days after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who is thought to have been his father.<ref name="Sharer494">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.494</ref> His reign lasted from 10 to 15 years and was a period of continued activity. In most of the Maya region cities were already suffering terminal decline, engulfed by the [[Classic Maya collapse]], but in Quirigu<U+00E1> "Sky Xul" dedicated three great zoomorph sculptures and two [[altar]]s, considered marvels of Maya stoneworking. "Sky Xul" died some time between 795 and 800.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, pp.222&ndash;24.</ref>

===Decline and collapse===

Little is known of "Jade Sky", who succeeded "Sky Xul" and was the last recorded ruler of Quirigu<U+00E1>. The city's power was already waning, as evidenced by the two stunted stelae erected during his reign, which indicate that the kingdom no longer had access to the kind of resources needed to produce monuments of a similar quality to those of his predecessors. However, "Jade Sky" did build two of the largest structures in the acropolis.<ref name="MG224">Martin & Grube 2000, p.224.</ref>

[[Image:Stela H east.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Eroded and unreadable hieroglyphs forming a diagonal interlace pattern|The badly eroded east face of Stela H<ref>Looper 2003, p.93.</ref>]]

Quirigu<U+00E1> apparently retained its independence from Cop<U+00E1>n and continued to flourish until the beginning of the 9th century.<ref name="Drew242"/> Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king [[Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat]] of Cop<U+00E1>n visited Quirigu<U+00E1> in order to carry out a [[katun (Maya calendar)|''k'atun'']]-ending ritual.<ref>Webster 2002, p.303.</ref><ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.483.</ref> However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quirigu<U+00E1>, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre.<ref>Demarest ''et al.'' 2005, p.556.</ref> After this, Quirigu<U+00E1> falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the [[Classic Maya collapse]]&nbsp;<U+2013> it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua;<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.527.</ref> within a few years Quirigu<U+00E1> was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.<ref name="MG225">Martin & Grube 2000, p.225.</ref>

===Postclassic===
In the early [[Postclassic]] Period (''c''. 900 &ndash; ''c''. 1200), Quirigu<U+00E1> was occupied by peoples closely linked to the Caribbean coastal areas of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] and [[Belize]], perhaps due to [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal]] Maya control of a trade network that included the Yucat<U+00E1>n coast and the Motagua Valley.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.488.</ref> During their brief reoccupation of the site they made substantial additions to the acropolis complex. Finds associated with their occupation include a reclining [[chacmool]] sculpture and ceramics from the east coast of Yucat<U+00E1>n,<ref name="MG225"/> artifacts that demonstrate a close link with the distant city of [[Chichen Itza]].<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.579.</ref> Some [[copper]] bells and ornaments were recovered from Quirigu<U+00E1>, they are among the earliest finds of metal artifacts in the Maya area. They have been dated to either the Terminal Classic (''c''. 800 &ndash; ''c''. 950) or the Early Postclassic.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.576.</ref>

===Modern history===
[[Image:QuriguaBlockBMaudslay.jpg|thumb|alt=A man standing beside a large sculptured boulder|Zoomorph B&nbsp;<U+2013> ''photo by Maudslay'']]
The first visitor to publish an account of Quirigu<U+00E1> was English architect and artist [[Frederick Catherwood]] who reached the ruins in 1840. The previous landowner, by the surname of Pay<U+00E9>s, had related the existence of the ruins to his sons and to Carlos Meiney, a [[Jamaica]]n Englishman resident in Guatemala. The elder Pay<U+00E9>s had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Pay<U+00E9>s' sons had previously visited the land containing the ruins, they invited [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and Catherwood to join them on a trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Pay<U+00E9>s brothers to Quirigu<U+00E1>.<ref name="Kelly243">Kelly 1996, p.243.</ref> Due to adverse conditions he was only able to stay a short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens's book ''Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan'' in 1841. Quirigu<U+00E1> was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves.<ref>Drew 1999, p.65.</ref> A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer. 

Explorer and archaeologist [[Alfred Maudslay]] visited Quirigu<U+00E1> for three days in 1881; they were the first [[pre-Columbian]] ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology.<ref name="Kelly243"/> He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], made paper and plaster [[Molding (process)|molds]] of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures;<ref name="Kelly243"/><ref>Drew 1999, p.89.</ref> these molds were then shipped to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], with casts being transferred to the [[British Museum]].<ref>Trustees of the British Museum, n.d.</ref>

In 1910, the [[United Fruit Company]] bought Quirigu<U+00E1> and all the land for a large distance around the site for [[banana]] production; they set aside 75 acres around the ceremonial centre as an archaeological park, leaving an island of jungle among the plantations.<ref name="Kelly244">Kelly 1996, p.244.</ref> More archaeological work was carried out from 1910 to 1914 by [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]] for the [[School of American Archaeology]] in Santa Fe.<ref name="Sharer352"/><ref name="Kelly244"/>  Duplicates of the stelae of Quirigu<U+00E1> made from Hewitt's plaster casts of the originals were exhibited at the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego, California]] in 1915. The [[Carnegie Institution]] conducted several intermittent projects at Quirigu<U+00E1> from 1915 through 1934.<ref name="Kelly244"/>  [[Aldous Huxley]], writing after visiting the site in the early 1930s, noted that Quirigu<U+00E1>'s stelae commemorated "man's triumph over time and matter and the triumph of time and matter over man."<ref>Huxley 1934, 1950, p.42.</ref> Quirigu<U+00E1> was among the first Maya archaeological sites to be intensively studied, although little restoration was carried out and the ruins once again became overgrown with jungle.<ref name="Kelly244"/>

Quirigu<U+00E1> was declared a National Monument in 1970 under Ministerial Accord 1210, this was followed on 19 June 1974 by its declaration as an Archaeological Park under Governmental Accord 35-74.<ref name="Torres">Torres.</ref>

From 1974 through 1979, an extensive archaeological project was conducted at Quirigu<U+00E1> sponsored by the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[National Geographic Society]], and the Guatemalan [[Instituto de Antropolog<U+00ED>a e Historia]]. Directed by [[Robert Sharer]] and [[William R. Coe]], the project excavated the acropolis, cleaned the monuments and studied outlying groups.<ref name="Sharer352">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.352.</ref><ref name="Kelly244"/><ref name="MG215">Martin & Grube 2000, p.215.</ref> It was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1981, and in 1999 UNESCO approved one-off funding of US$27,248 for "emergency assistance for the rehabilitation of the archaeological site of Quirigu<U+00E1>".<ref>UNESCO World Heritage Centre.</ref> One of the site's stelae is depicted on the Guatemalan [[Guatemalan quetzal#Coins|10 centavo coin]].<ref>Banco de Guatemala.</ref>

The {{convert|34|ha|acre|adj=on}} area included within the Archaeological Park of Quirigu<U+00E1> has been developed for tourism with the construction of a car park, site museum and sanitation facilities and is open to the public on a daily basis.<ref>Torres.</ref>

==The site==
===Architecture===
[[Image:QuiriguaGreatPlaza1.jpg|thumb|alt=A flat, open grassy area bordered by trees with a few thatched rooves covering monuments and a path and drainage channel to the left|The Great Plaza of Quirigu<U+00E1>, originally laid out by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat; view is from the acropolis looking north]]
After Quirigu<U+00E1>'s pivotal victory over Cop<U+00E1>n in 738, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main group in the image of Cop<U+00E1>n itself. Thus, the [[acropolis]], palace and ballcourt all lie at the southern end of the Great Plaza.<ref name="Miller54"/> The ceremonial centre is laid out around three plazas, the northernmost is the Great Plaza. This plaza measures {{convert|325|m|ft|abbr=on}} from north to south and is the largest plaza in the whole Maya region. At the southern end of the Great Plaza is the Ballcourt Plaza, surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. The Acropolis Plaza is a fully enclosed plaza within the acropolis itself.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.236.</ref><ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.220.</ref> The area to the west of the Ballcourt Plaza was probably the riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of the Great Plaza was a marketplace.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.353, 486.</ref> A number of ceramic-lined [[Water well|wells]] have been excavated near to the site core, these were all built in the 8th century and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.<ref>Ashmore 1984, pp.149, 151.</ref>

*'''1A-1''' is an enormous platform forming the northern part of the Great Plaza. It measures {{convert|100|by|85|m|ft}} and rises {{convert|0.5|m|in}} above the level of the southern part of the plaza. It forms the northern portion of the Great Plaza, being built by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat when he extended the plaza northwards. The platform was built from river [[Cobblestone|cobbles]] and was paved with stone slabs.<ref name="Loop122">Looper 2003, p.122.</ref> Platform 1A-1 supported the stelae A, C, D, E and F and Zoomorph B.<ref name="Loop123">Looper 2003, p.123.</ref> The platform was built in two phases over about 20 years.<ref>Looper 2003, p.178.</ref>

*'''1A-3''' is a large mound marking the northern edge of the Great Plaza. It originally measured {{convert|82.5|by|20|m|ft}} and was {{convert|7|m|ft}} high. A {{convert|63|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway climbed the southern face of the structure from the plaza. The structure was later extended to the north but this second phase of construction was never finished.<ref name="Loop122"/>

*'''The acropolis''' is the largest architectural complex at Quirigu<U+00E1>, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned.<ref name="Kelly239">Kelly 1996, p.239.</ref> The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes.<ref name="Kelly241"/> The acropolis complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of [[corbel arch]]es but none are still standing.<ref name="Kelly241">Kelly 1996, p.241.</ref>

*'''1B-sub.1''' is also known as the K'inich Ahau Wall. It was a free-standing wall over {{convert|23|m|ft}} long and {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} thick, it stood on top of the western platform of the acropolis. The western side of the wall overlooked the river and bore five alternating [[mosaic]] masks representing [[Solar deity|solar deities]] and [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] with human arms. These masks were supported by a [[frieze]] consisting of two concentric ovals flanked by serpent heads. The wall was completed around 750, during the reign of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref name="Loop119">Looper 2003, p.119.</ref>

*'''1B-sub.4''' Excavations at the acropolis discovered a completely buried [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] under the structures on the west side of the Acropolis Plaza,<ref name="Sharer353"/> a rare example of a ballcourt having been built over by subsequent construction, in this case by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref>Scarborough 1991, p.130.</ref> This was the first ballcourt at the site and dates to the middle of the 7th century. It was built with blocks of [[rhyolite]].<ref name="Loop53">Looper 2003, p.53.</ref> This ballcourt is a close copy of the ballcourts at Cop<U+00E1>n, being built in the same style, to the same dimensions and with the same orientation.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.53, 55.</ref> The ballcourt was buried when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat built the massive western platform to restrict access to the acropolis.<ref name="Loop119"/>

[[Image:QuiriguaAcropolis.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A flat grassy area with low stepped structures at the far side, bordered by trees|View of the acropolis across the Ballcourt Plaza]]
*'''1B-1''' is a structure which forms the southern limit of the Acropolis Plaza, a broad stairway leads down to the plaza from the northern side of the building. The lower walls of the structure are still standing and it has three entrances, each of which opens onto a small chamber. Each of the three chambers has a hieroglyphic step on the back wall leading to another small chamber. Originally the building had an external band of hieroglyphs. Both the exterior and internal [[glyph]]s bear the last known date recorded at Quirigu<U+00E1>, falling in June 810. This building was built during the reign of "Jade Sky".<ref name="MG224"/><ref>Kelly 1996, p.240.</ref>

*'''1B-2''' also lies south of the Acropolis Plaza, in the southwest corner. It is smaller than structure 1B-1, which it adjoins, and its lower walls are also still standing. It was a small residential building that was elaborately decorated with sculptured stonework. This structure was probably the residence of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref name="Sharer353"/><ref name="Kelly236-40">Kelly 1996, pp.236, 240.</ref>

*'''1B-3''' and '''1B-4''' are structures on the west side of the Acropolis Plaza, only the lower walls remain.<ref name="Kelly239"/> Between these two structures is an older free-standing wall. This wall has a westward facing mosaic frieze that bears damaged and now headless depictions of [[Kinich Ahau]], the sun god.<ref name="Kelly239"/>

*'''1B-5''' lies to the north of the Acropolis Plaza, at the south-eastern corner of the Ballcourt Plaza. This structure was accessed via a broad stairway from the Acropolis Plaza to the south, which rises to a single entrance opening onto seven interconnected chambers. This is the largest building at Quirigu<U+00E1> and its walls are still standing.<ref name="Kelly236-41">Kelly 1996, pp.236, 241.</ref> It was built during the reign of "Jade Sky".<ref name="MG224"/>

*'''1B-6''' lies to the east of the Acropolis Plaza and contained an [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral shrine]], reflecting a long established tradition first seen at Tikal.<ref name="Sharer353">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.353.</ref> Located under the building was a tomb lined with slabs of [[schist]], which contained an elite burial. The remains probably belonged to a male, the teeth were inlaid with jade and a [[bead]] of the same material had been placed in the mouth. Associated ceramic offerings date this tomb to the Early Classic.<ref name="Loop36">Looper 2003, p.36.</ref>

*'''1B-7''' is a ballcourt, built by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to replace the ballcourt buried under his expansion of the acropolis. The ballcourt lies in the Ballcourt Plaza, to which it gives its name, to the northwest of the acropolis.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.20, 119.</ref> The ballcourt has an east-west orientation that is unusual in the Maya region, where ballcourts are traditionally aligned north-south.<ref>Scarborough 1991, p.138.</ref>

*'''3C-1''' is a broad earthen platform on the valley floor, it dates to the middle of the Classic Period and is one of the earlier constructions at the site, parts of it continuing in use after a catastrophic flood.<ref name="MG216"/><ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.217.</ref>

*'''3C-7''' is a group dating to the Early Classic. It is on the floodplain some distance to the north of the acropolis.<ref name="Loop36"/>

*'''3C-8''' is another Early Classic group located to the north of the acropolis.<ref name="Loop36"/>

*'''Locus 011''' and '''Locus 057''' may have been watchposts, they were situated at the points where the Quirigu<U+00E1> and the Jubuco rivers entered the Motagua Valley and may have been used to control passing traffic on these routes. Locus 057 was situated on one of the most probable routes to Cop<U+00E1>n and may have been a watchpost to look out for enemy warriors after the defeat of Cop<U+00E1>n by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref>Looper 2003, p.120.</ref>

*'''Locus 122''' and '''Locus 123''' are groups located on the floodplain south of the river. Locus 122, although unexcavated, is a compound consisting of a pyramidal mound and a NE-SW oriented plaza, similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands, for which reason it is presumed to date from that period.<ref name="Loop35"/>

Groups A, B and C lie at a distance of one to three miles from the site core.<ref name="Kelly241"/>
*'''Group A''' is a hilltop complex roughly dating to the early [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]].<ref name="MG216"/> A stela found in this group dates to 493.<ref name="Kelly241"/>

*'''Group B''', also known as '''Group 7A-1''', is to the north of the site core.<ref>Looper 2003, p.195.</ref> It is the location of the badly eroded Stela S, which was moved here from the Great Plaza in ancient times.<ref name="Kelly241"/><ref name="Loop88">Looper 2003, p.88.</ref>

*'''Group C''' has an unsculptured stela.<ref name="Kelly241"/>

===Monuments===

The monuments at Quirigu<U+00E1> include unusually huge [[stela]]e elaborately carved from single blocks of red sandstone, brought from quarries {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} away.<ref name="Drew241"/> The characteristics of this hard rock allowed the local sculptors to produce low-[[relief]] sculptures enhanced by three-dimensional faces, in contrast with the contemporary two-dimensional sculpture of the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin|Pet<U+00E9>n]] region.<ref>Miller 1999, pp.132&ndash;133.</ref> After the defeat and execution of the king of Cop<U+00E1>n in 738, the sculptural style of Quirigu<U+00E1> closely resembled that of its former overlord.<ref name="Miller1345"/>  The enormous stelae at Quirig<U+00E1> would originally have been visible from the Motagua River, which once flowed past the west side of the Great Plaza, announcing the new-found power of the city to passing traders.<ref name="Sharer486">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.486.</ref> The monuments include long panels of glyphic text that are considered among the most complex and beautiful of all Maya stone inscriptions. A characteristic of these texts is the use of full-figure glyphs in which the normal bar and dot number glyphs of [[Maya script]] are replaced with exquisitely carved representations of the gods.<ref name="Drew242">Drew 1999, p.242.</ref> However, by the latter part of the 8th century Quirigu<U+00E1> had developed an original style with the production of boulders elaborately sculpted into the forms of composite [[Legendary creature|mythological animals]] bearing elements of [[toad]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[crocodile]]s and [[birds of prey]]; these sculptures are referred to as ''zoomorphs'' and were completed by two later kings after the death of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785.<ref name="Miller1345"/><ref name="Drew242"/>

There are also various altars and sculptures used as decoration in the facades of buildings; most Quirigu<U+00E1> monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff compared to the naturalistic grace of the art of some other Maya sites. Traces of red [[pigment]] have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice and renewal.<ref name="Loop17">Looper 2003, p.17.</ref>

*'''Stela A''' was erected in 775 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref name="Kelly235"/> Stela A and Stela C form a pair and were both dedicated on 29 December 775.<ref name="Loop164">Looper 2003, pp.158, 164.</ref>

*'''Zoomorph B''' was dedicated in 780 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, it is a multi-ton boulder sculptured into a half-crocodile half-mountain beast. The hieroglyphic text on this monument consists entirely of full-figure glyphs.<ref name="MG222">Martin & Grube 2000, p.222.</ref> Traces of red pigment have been found on this zoomorph, which is {{convert|4|m|ft}} long.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.17, 172.</ref> A dedication cache was found buried in a pit under Zoomorph B, it included seven flint blades between {{convert|14|and|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>Looper 2003, p.237, n.12.</ref>

*'''Stela C''' was erected in 775 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref name="Kelly235">Kelly 1996, p.235.</ref> The hieroglyphic text contains references to 455 and Tutuum Yohl K'inich, an early king.<ref name="Kelly235"/><ref>Looper 2003, p.38.</ref> The stela also bears a reference to the date 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahaw 8 Kumk'u (August 13, 3114 BC).<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, pp.221&ndash;22.</ref> This date is recorded throughout the entire Maya area as the beginning of the current creation, when the gods were placed in order.<ref>Stuart 2008, pp.212<U+2013>13.</ref> Stela C forms a pair with Stela A and was dedicated on the same date.<ref name="Loop164"/>

*'''Stela D''' dates to 766, during the reign of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.<ref name="Kelly235"/> It is distinguished by the relatively rare, extravagant, full-figure [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] versions of Maya hieroglyphics on the upper parts of its sides, which are particularly well preserved.<ref name="Kelly235"/> Stela D is roughly {{convert|6|m|ft}} in height.<ref>Looper 2003, p.139.</ref>

*'''Stela E''' stands in the northern half of the Great Plaza.<ref name="Loop20">Looper 2003, p.20.</ref> This stela was dedicated on 24 January 771 by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its total shaft measures {{convert|10.6|m|ft}} in height, including the buried portion holding it in place, which measures just under {{convert|3|m|ft|0}}.<ref name="Loop147">Looper 2003, p.147.</ref> This enormous [[monolith]] is the largest stone ever quarried by the ancient Maya and weighs approximately 65 tons,<ref name="Loop147"/> it may even be the largest free-standing worked [[monolith]] in the [[New World]].<ref name="Coe121">Coe 1999, p.121.</ref> In 1917 this stela, already tilting from vertical, finally fell over completely after heavy rains, although it remained unbroken. In 1934 an attempt was made to raise the stela using a [[winch]] and steel cables, during which the cables snapped and the monolith fell and was broken into two pieces, which have since been joined back together using [[concrete]].<ref name="Loop147"/> This stela bears portraits of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its front and back.<ref name="MG221"/>

*'''Stela F''' is an enormous {{convert|7.3|m|ft|adj=on}} high monolith carved from sandstone. It bears representations of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its north and south sides and hieroglyphic inscriptions on its east and west sides. It dates to 761 and when it was raised it was the tallest monument ever erected by the Maya, it was only surpassed when Stela E was erected 10 years later.<ref name="Loop123"/><ref name="MG221"/>

*'''Zoomorph G''' is the memorial monument to K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, dedicated during the reign of "Sky Xul". It shows the face of the dead king emerging from the maw of an enormous jaguar. The text of this monument describes the death and burial of Quirigu<U+00E1>'s greatest king.<ref name="MG222"/>

*'''Stela H''' dates to 751, during the reign of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its glyphs are arranged in a rare mat pattern, copied from Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Kelly 1996, pp.235&ndash;37.</ref> The stela is executed in the wrap-around style.<ref name="MG221">Martin & Grube 2000, p.221.</ref> A flint blade was found buried under the stela butt, buried as an offering when the stela was dedicated.<ref name="Loop90"/> The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged.<ref>Looper 2003, p.101.</ref>

*'''Stela J''' was erected by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 756 and is carved in the wrap-around style.<ref name="MG221"/> It stands {{convert|5|m|ft}} high and is located in the southern part of the Great Plaza. The dedicatory cache consisted of a house-shaped clay box with unknown contents.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.100&ndash;101.</ref>

*'''Altar L''' is fairly crudely worked and dates to 653. The text bears the name of king K'awiil Yopaat and also mentions "Smoke Imix", the 12th king of Cop<U+00E1>n. The altar is a [[rhyolite]] disk {{convert|1|m|in|0}} in diameter and {{convert|0.25|m|in|0}} thick. The sculptural style of this altar is unique, and shows affinities with the distant site of Caracol in Belize.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.50&ndash;53.</ref><ref>Martin & Grube 2000, pp.201, 217.</ref>

*'''Altar M''' this modest monument is the earliest known monument dedicated by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. The importance of this monument lies in its text, in which this preeminent king of Quirgu<U+00E1> claimed the title of ''k'uhul ajaw'', holy lord, and began his bid for independence from Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref name="Sharer482">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.482.</ref> This rhyolite sculpture was dedicated on 15 September 734 and has the form of a monstrous head, possibly that of a crocodilian.<ref>Looper 2003, p.58.</ref>

*'''Altar N''' is another small rhyolite sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has the form of a [[turtle]] shell with a skeletal head with a mirror on its forehead emerging sideways from one end and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the [[bicephalic]] deity [[Pawatun]] (God N), a prominent [[underworld]] deity.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.58, 61&ndash;62.</ref>

*'''Zoomorph O''' is a crocodile-mountain hybrid monster, dedicated in 790 by king "Sky Xul". It is accompanied by an altar depicting a lightning god. It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza, just south of the ballcourt itself.<ref name="MG223"/>

*'''Zoomorph P''' (which explorer Maudslay nicknamed ''The Great Turtle'') was dedicated in 795 by "Sky Xul" and is a masterpiece of Mesoamerican art. It weighs around 20 tons. On one side it depicts a larger-than-life portrait of "Sky Xul" himself seated cross-legged in the open jaws of an enormous crocodile-mountain hybrid monster. The design of this zoomorph is incredibly intricate and the whole monument is covered with skilfully executed sculpture. It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza, just south of the ballcourt. Zoomorph P is accompanied by an altar depicting an unidentified deity leaping from a split in the earth.<ref name="MG223">Martin & Grube 2000, p.223.</ref> A hieroglyphic text on the zoomorph describes the founding of Quirigu<U+00E1> under the supervision of the king of Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.494.</ref> Traces of red pigment have been found on this monument, suggesting that it was originally painted red.<ref name="Loop17"/>

*'''Altar Q''' and '''Altar R''' are two small rhyolite disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt, the buried Structure 1B-sub.4. Together with a third stone they would have marked the central axis of the ballcourt. They both bear seated cross-legged figures carved in shallow relief.<ref name="Loop53"/>

*'''Stela S''' is the earliest surviving monument of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, it dates to 746.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, pp.220&ndash;21.</ref> It was originally located in the northern half of the Great Plaza but was moved to an outlying group in ancient times. It is heavily eroded, some of the damage may have been inflicted by the process of moving it. It was fashioned from sandstone and bears the figure of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the front, the other three sides being covered by hieroglyphic text. Unfortunately, due to the heavy erosion most of the text is illegible.<ref name="Loop88"/> Stela S is {{convert|2.8|m|ft|0}} high (not including the part of the stela buried in the ground) and the dimensions of the base are {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} by {{convert|1.2|m|ft}}, making it the earliest of the huge stelae that were to characterise Quirigu<U+00E1>, although it is significantly smaller than those that were to follow.<ref name="Loop90">Looper 2003, p.90.</ref>

*'''Stela T''' was dedicated in 692 by an unknown ruler. It is a badly eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly unreadable glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure. The stela is conservative in style, being similar to the much older Stela U.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.55&ndash;56, 207.</ref>

*'''Stela U''' comes from Group A and bears a heavily eroded portrait of a king in wrap-around style (extending over three sides of the stela). This style originated in Tikal and indicates contact with the central Pet<U+00E9>n region. This stela has an identifiable date, corresponding to 18 April 480, and a reference to a ritual taking place that was supervised by the king of Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref name="MG217"/> This stela is carved from [[schist]] and is broken in two pieces, being snapped off at the knees&nbsp;<U+2013> apparently deliberately during an attack by unknown enemies. It was originally {{convert|2.7|m|ft|0}} in height.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.39, 50.</ref>

*'''Monument 25''' is a plain round column carved from schist. It is about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|0}} long and {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0}} in diameter. It was found in Locus 011.<ref>Looper 2003, p.233, n.5.</ref>

*'''Monument 26''' is a stela in wrap-around style found close to structure 3C-1. A date corresponding to 493 is contained in the hieroglyphic text on its back, this text mentions the third and fourth rulers of Quirigu<U+00E1> but their names are currently unreadable.<ref name="MG217"/> It is carved from schist and was originally {{convert|2|m|ft}} high but the stela was broken in ancient times, apparently deliberately. It was broken off at the knees and the left eye of the ruler's portrait was scratched away, damage characteristic of that inflicted by invading warriors. Only two pieces have been recovered, an upper section measuring {{convert|1|m|ft}} and a lower section measuring {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0}}.<ref>Looper 2003, pp.40, 50.</ref>

*'''Monument 29''' and '''Monument 30''' are heavily eroded columnar sculptures fashioned from schist, each measuring a little over 1m in length. They were found together in a modern drainage ditch to the north and northwest of the ceremonial centre of Quirigu<U+00E1>. They apparently were sculptures of anthropomorphs or [[monkey]]s standing on [[pedestal]]s with their hands clasped on their chests. It is thought on stylistic grounds that these two monuments date to the Late Preclassic.<ref name="Loop35"/>
