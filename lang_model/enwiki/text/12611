The '''''Swiftsure'' class''' was a group of two [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s. Originally ordered by Chile during a period of high tension with Argentina, they were intended to defeat a pair of [[armoured cruiser]]s ordered by the latter country and were optimized for this role. This meant that they were smaller and more lightly armed than most battleships of the time. They were purchased by the United Kingdom in 1903 prior to their completion to prevent their purchase by the Russian Empire as tensions were rising between them and the Japanese Empire, a British ally. Completed the following year, ''Swiftsure'' and ''Triumph'' had roughly similar careers for the first decade of their service careers. They were initially assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] and [[Channel Fleet]]s before being transferred to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1909. Both ships rejoined Home Fleet in 1912 and were transferred abroad in 1913, ''Swiftsure'' to the [[East Indies Station]] as its [[flagship]], and ''Triumph'' to the [[China Station]].

After the beginning of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Swiftsure'' escorted troop convoys in the [[Indian Ocean]] until she was transferred to the [[Suez Canal]] Patrol in December. After defending the Canal in early 1915 from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks, the ship was then transferred to the [[Dardanelles]] in February and saw action in the [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]] bombarding Ottoman fortifications. ''Triumph'' participated in the hunt for the [[German East Asia Squadron]] of [[Maximilian Graf von Spee]] and in the campaign against the German colony at [[Tsingtao]], China. The ship was transferred to the [[Mediterranean]] in early 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign. She was torpedoed and sunk off [[Gaba Tepe]] by the German [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}} on 25 May 1915.<ref name=b274/>

''Swiftsure'' was assigned to convoy escort duties in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] from early 1916 until she was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in April 1917 to provide crews for [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] vessels. In mid-1918, the ship was disarmed and stripped in order to be used as a [[blockship]] during a proposed second raid on [[Ostend]]. ''Swiftsure'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1920.

==Design and description==
===Background===
In late 1901, [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] were on the brink of war, and Chile was concerned about its navy's ability to counter the [[armoured cruiser]]s ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'', which Argentina had ordered from [[Italy]] earlier that year. [[Edward James Reed|Sir Edward Reed]], chief designer for [[Armstrong Whitworth]], was in Chile for health reasons at the time, and met with [[Chilean Navy]] officials to discuss the idea of purchasing or building two battleships with high speed and a powerful armament on a low displacement. Purchase of existing ships was not a practical option, so the Chileans asked Reed to design the ships for construction in the [[United Kingdom]]. Chile ordered the ships, to be named ''Constituci<U+00F3>n'' and ''Libertad'', on 26 February 1902, ''Constituci<U+00F3>n'' from [[Armstrong Whitworth]] at [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] and ''Libertad'' from [[Vickers]] at [[Barrow-in-Furness]].<ref>Burt, pp. 259, 261</ref>

[[File:Swiftsure class diagrams Brasseys 1915.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1915</center>]]
The ships were considered second-class battleships, lightly constructed, armed, and armoured by British standards; ''Swiftsure'', in fact, suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening, although ''Triumph'' did not have such problems. Chile had required the ships to fit into the [[graving dock]] at [[Talcahuano]], so they had to be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards. Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell-handling rooms also were different from British standards.<ref name=b262>Burt, pp. 262, 264</ref>

After the war crisis subsided, Argentina opted to put ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' up for sale;<ref>Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 403</ref> in addition Chile began to have financial problems, so ''Constituci<U+00F3>n'' and ''Libertad'' were put up for sale in early 1903. Concerned that [[Russian Empire|Russia]] might buy them, the United Kingdom stepped in and purchased the still-incomplete ships from Chile on 3 December 1903 for <U+00A3>2,432,000.<ref name=b2/>

Their purchase by the [[Admiralty]] was organised by the London firm of Antony Gibbs and Sons, a partnership run by [[Alban Gibbs, 2nd Baron Aldenham|Alban Gibbs]] and his younger brother [[Vicary Gibbs (MP)|Vicary Gibbs]].<ref name="hansard-resign">{{cite hansard | house=House of Commons | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/feb/02/new-writs#column_74 | date = 2 February, 1904 | column_start = 74 | column_end = 75 }}</ref> Both were [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), and their role in the transaction meant that they were disqualified from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], under an old law which debarred MPs from accepting contracts from [[the Crown]]. This triggered two by-elections, in which Alban was [[City of London by-election, 1904|re-elected unopposed]],<ref>Craig, p. 11</ref> but Vicary [[St Albans by-election, 1904|lost his seat]].<ref>Craig, p. 297</ref>

Although they were designed to Chilean rather than British requirements and required some modifications during construction after their purchase, no major changes were needed to the design to render them suitable for British service. Both were completed in June 1904 and entered service with the Royal Navy, ''Constituci<U+00F3>n'' as [[HMS Swiftsure (1903)|''Swiftsure'']] and ''Libertad'' as [[HMS Triumph (1903)|HMS ''Triumph]].<ref>Burt, pp. 259, 261<U+2013>62</ref>

===General characteristics===
The ''Swiftsure''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|475|ft|3|in|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|71|ft|1|in|m|1}},<ref name=b2/> and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. They displaced {{convert|12175|LT|t}} at [[Standard displacement#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|13840|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ships were some {{convert|375|LT}} overweight compared to their designed displacement which increased their draught and reduced their [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]].<ref>Parkes, pp. 436, 438</ref>

In 1914, the crew numbered 803 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=b2/> The ''Swiftsure''s were quite manoeuvrable as a result of their balanced [[rudder]] and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective.<ref name="fighting39">Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 39</ref> They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.<ref name=b274/>

===Propulsion===
The ships were powered by two four-cylinder inverted [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving a single propeller. A dozen [[Yarrow boiler]]s provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of {{convert|280|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced a total of {{convert|12500|ihp|lk=in}} which was intended to allow the ships to reach a speed of {{convert|19.5|kn|lk=in}}. The engines proved to be more powerful than anticipated and both ships exceeded {{convert|20|kn}} during [[sea trial]]s. This made them the fastest battleships in the Royal Navy at the time of their completion, although their sustained speed in service was slightly slower than that of the older {{sclass|Duncan|battleship|4}}s.<ref>Burt, pp. 271<U+2013>72</ref> They carried a maximum of {{convert|2048|LT|t}} of coal, enough to steam {{convert|6210|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|knots}}.<ref name=b2/> In service they proved to be more economical than first thought with an estimated range of {{convert|12000|nmi}} at 10 knots.<ref>Parkes, p. 439</ref>

===Armament===
Neither ship's armament was of a standard Royal Navy type<U+2014>they had been designed to meet the requirements of the Chilean Navy and each ship was armed by its respective builder, although performance was identical. They were the first British battleships since the {{sclass|Centurion|battleship|4}} to mount a main battery of 10-inch (254&nbsp;mm) guns and the last to do so. The ships mounted slightly different types of 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] 10-inch guns, each ship using guns designed by its builder. They followed the standard British practice of the time of mounting the main battery in two twin turrets, one forward and one aft. The Royal Navy believed that the 10-inch guns were too light to be effective against modern battleships; they could penetrate the armour of the latest [[Germany|German]] and Russian battleships, but not that of the better-armoured [[France|French]] battleships.<ref>Burt, pp. 264, 266</ref> The guns had minor differences in construction, but they both fired {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2656|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this provided a maximum range of {{convert|14800|yd|m}} at the gun's maximum elevation of 13.5<U+00B0>. The firing cycle of the Mk VI guns used on ''Swiftsure'' was claimed to be 15 seconds while that of the Mk VII guns on ''Triumph'' was 20-25 seconds.<ref>Friedman, pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> Each gun was provided with 90 shells per gun.<ref name=b2>Burt, p. 262</ref>

[[File:HMS Swiftsure LOC ggbain 16800.jpg|thumb|right|''Swiftsure'' at anchor]]
They had a powerful secondary battery, being the only British battleships to mount 50-calibre [[BL 7.5 inch Mk II <U+2013> V naval gun|7.5-inch guns]]; these were of a different type than the 7.5-inch guns mounted on later British cruisers. Ten of the guns were mounted in a central [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] on the main deck, where they were criticized for taking up too much deck space; the other four were in [[casemate]]s abreast the fore- and [[mainmast]]s on the upper deck.<ref>Burt, pp. 267<U+2013>68</ref> A more serious problem was that they were mounted low in the ship<U+2014>only about {{convert|10|ft|0}} above water at deep load<U+2014>and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather as they dipped their muzzles in the sea when rolling more than 14<U+00B0>.<ref>Parkes, p. 438</ref> The two types of guns differed slightly in construction, but had identical performance. They fired {{convert|200|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2781|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of four rounds per minutes. At their maximum elevation of 15<U+00B0> they had a maximum range of about {{convert|14000|yd|m}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 77<U+2013>78</ref> The ships carried 150 rounds per gun.<ref name=b2/>

Defence against torpedo boats was provided by fourteen [[List of British ordnance terms#QF|QF (quick-firing)]] 14-pounder Mk I or Mk II guns firing {{convert|14|lb|adj=on|1}} shells, but the guns were modified to use the standard {{convert|12.5|lb|adj=on|1}} shell used by the [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12 pounder 18 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 64 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> gun in British service.<ref name=b2/> They fired {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}, 12.5-lb projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2548|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range and rate of fire is unknown.<ref>Friedman, p. 111</ref> 200 rounds per gun were carried by each ship.<ref name=b2/>

The ships were also equipped with a pair of [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (450 mm)]] submerged [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each [[broadside]]. They were provided with nine [[torpedo]]es.<ref name=b2/>

===Armour===
The ''Swiftsures''{{'}}s armour scheme was roughly comparable to that of the ''Duncan'' class. The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] was composed of [[Krupp armour|Krupp cemented armour]] (KCA) {{convert|7|in|mm|0}} thick. It was {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} high of which {{convert|5|ft|3|in|1}} was below the waterline at normal load. Fore and aft of the {{convert|2|-|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} oblique [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] that connected the belt armour to the [[barbette]]s, the belt continued, but was reduced in thickness. It was six inches thick abreast the barbettes, but was reduced to two inches fore and aft of the barbettes. It continued forward to the bow and supported the ship's spur-type [[naval ram|ram]]. It continued aft to the steering gear compartment and terminated in {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}} transverse bulkhead. The upper strake of 7-inch armour covered the ship's side between the rear of the barbettes up to the level of the upper deck. The upper deck casemates were also protected by 7-inch faces and sides, but were enclosed by rear 3-inch plates. The 7.5-inch guns on the main deck were separated by {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} screens with {{convert|.5|in|1}} plating protecting the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] uptakes to their rear. A longitudinal 1-inch bulkhead divided the [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] down its centreline.<ref name=b1>Burt, pp. 269<U+2013>71</ref>

The turret faces were {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} thick and their sides and rear were {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} thick. Their roofs were two inches thick and the sighting hood protecting the gunners was {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} thick. Above the upper deck the barbettes were {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} thick on their faces and eight inches on the rear. Below this level they thinned to three and two inches respectively. The conning tower was protected by {{convert|11|in|mm|0}} of armour on its face and eight inches on its rear. The [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armour inside the central citadel ranged from 1 to 1.5 inches in thickness. Outside the citadel, the lower deck was three inches thick and and sloped to meet the lower side of the belt armour. Naval historian R. A. Burt assessed the greatest weakness of their armour scheme as the reduction in the thickness of the barbette armour below the upper deck. He believed that this made the ships' [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s vulnerable to oblique hits near the barbettes.<ref name=b1/>

''Swiftsure'' was commissioned on 21 June 1904 for service in the Home Fleet and the Channel Fleet until 1908. She collided with ''Triumph'' 3 June 1905 and suffered damage to her propellers, [[sternwalk]] and aft hull. The ship was refitted at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in June<U+2013>July 1906. ''Swiftsure'' was briefly placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] from 7 October 1908 to 6 April 1909 when she was recommissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. The ship was reassigned to Home Fleet on 8 May 1912 until she was given a lengthy refit from September 1912 to March 1913. ''Swiftsure'' was recommissioned on 26 March and assigned as the flagship of the East Indies Station.<ref>Burt, p. 274</ref>

During World War I, the ship escorted Indian troops from [[Bombay]] to [[Aden]] from September<U+2013>November 1914. She was then transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol on 1 December to help defend the Canal. From 27 January to 4 February 1915, the ship helped to defend the Canal during the [[First Suez Offensive]] by Ottoman forces. ''Swiftsure'' was then transferred to the Dardanelles on 28 February and saw action in the Dardanelles Campaign bombarding Ottoman fortifications. She was assigned to the [[9th Cruiser Squadron]] for escort duties in the Atlantic in February 1916. On 11 April 1917, the ship arrived at Chatham where she was paid off and placed in reserve to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. ''Swiftsure'' was refitted in mid-1917 and was used as an [[accommodation ship]] from February 1918. Later that year, the ship was disarmed and stripped in order to be used as a blockship during a proposed second raid on Ostend. The war ended, however, before this was carried out and she was briefly used as a [[target ship]] before she was listed for sale in March 1920. ''Swiftsure'' was sold for scrap on 18 June 1920 to the Stanlee Shipbreaking Company.<ref name=b274>Burt, pp. 275<U+2013>76</ref>

Much like ''Swiftsure'', ''Triumph'' was commissioned on 21 June 1904 and was initially assigned to the Home Fleet, later the Channel Fleet, until 1909. On 17 September 1904 the ship was struck by {{SS|Siren}} off [[Pembroke Dock]] and was only slightly damaged. The following year, she accidentally struck her [[sister ship]] and sustained damage to her bow. ''Triumph'' received a brief refit at Chatham Dockyard in October 1908 and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet on 26 April 1909. The ship returned to the Home Fleet in May 1912. She was transferred to the China Station on 28 August 1913 and was placed in reserve at [[Hong Kong]] until mobilized in August 1914 at the beginning of World War I.<ref name=b5/>

''Triumph'' participated in the hunt for the East Asia Squadron and in the campaign against the German colony at Tsingtao, China until November when she began a refit at Hong Kong. The ship departed on 12 January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign. She was torpedoed and sunk off Gaba Tepe by the German submarine [[SM U-21 (Germany)|''U-21'']] while bombarding Ottoman fortifications in the Dardanelles on 25 May 1915.<ref name=b274/>
