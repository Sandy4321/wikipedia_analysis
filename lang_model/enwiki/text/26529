'''Antonin Gregory Scalia''' ({{IPA-en|sk<U+0259><U+02C8>li<U+02D0><U+0259>|pron|Scalia Name.ogg|}}; born March 11, 1936) is an American [[jurist]] who serves as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Appointed to the Court by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986, he has been described as the intellectual anchor of the Court's conservative wing.

Scalia was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and attended public grade school and Catholic high school in New York City, where his family had moved.  He attended [[Georgetown University]] as an undergraduate, and obtained his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]].  After spending six years in a Cleveland law firm, he became a law school professor.  In the early 1970s, he served in the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administrations, first heading minor administrative agencies, and then as an [[United States Assistant Attorney General|assistant attorney general]].  He spent most of the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] years teaching at the [[University of Chicago]], where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling [[Federalist Society]].  In 1982, he was appointed as a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].

In 1986, Judge Scalia was appointed by Reagan to the Supreme Court to fill the seat as associate justice vacated when Justice [[William Rehnquist]] was elevated to Chief Justice.  While Rehnquist's confirmation was contentious, Scalia was asked few difficult questions by the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], and faced no opposition.  Scalia was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, and took the bench on September 26, 1986.

In his near quarter-century on the Court, Justice Scalia has staked out a conservative ideology in his opinions, advocating [[textualism]] in [[statutory interpretation]] and [[originalism]] in [[constitutional interpretation]].  He is a strong defender of the powers of the Executive Branch, believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas.  He opposes [[affirmative action]] and other policies that treat minorities as groups.  He files separate opinions in large numbers of cases, and, in his minority opinions, often castigates the Court's majority in scathing language.

Though rejected from his first-choice school, [[Princeton University]], Scalia enrolled at [[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|Georgetown University]] in 1953.  He graduated valedictorian and ''[[summa cum laude]]'' with an [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in History from Georgetown in 1957.

On September 10, 1960, Scalia married Maureen McCarthy, whom he met on a blind date while he was at Harvard Law School.  Maureen Scalia had been an undergraduate at [[Radcliffe College]] when the two met, and subsequently obtained a degree in English from the school.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=30<U+2013>31.}}</ref>  The couple raised nine children, five boys and four girls.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=361.}}</ref>

==Legal career==
Scalia began his legal career at [[Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where he worked from 1961 to 1967.<ref name="hlrecord"/>   He was highly regarded at Jones, Day and would most likely have been made a partner, but later stated that he had long intended to teach.<ref name = "canteach">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=37<U+2013>38.}}</ref>  He became a Professor of Law at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1967, moving his family to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].<ref name = "canteach"/>

After four years in Charlottesville, in 1971, Scalia entered public service.  President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed him as the general counsel for the [[Office of Telecommunications Policy]], where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of [[cable television]].<ref name = "pbs"/>  From 1972 to 1974, he was the chairman of the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]], a small [[independent agency]] which sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy.<ref name = "pbs"/>  In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]].<ref name="pbs"/>  After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by the new President, [[Gerald Ford]], and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=40.}}</ref>

In the aftermath of [[Watergate]], the Ford administration was engaged in a number of conflicts with Congress.  Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of [[executive privilege]] in refusing to turn over documents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=49<U+2013>53.}}</ref>  Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the [[Freedom of Information Act]], greatly increasing its scope.  Scalia's position prevailed and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode his veto.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=45<U+2013>47.}}</ref>  In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, ''[[Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba]]''.  Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position prevailed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=63, 374.}}</ref>

Following Ford's defeat by [[Jimmy Carter]], Scalia worked for several months at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|pp=13<U+2013>14.}}</ref>  He then returned to academia, taking up residence at the [[University of Chicago]] [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]] from 1977 to 1982,<ref name = "chic"/> though he spent one year as a visiting professor at [[Stanford University]] law school.<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|p=19.}}</ref>  In 1981, he became the first faculty advisor for the University of Chicago's chapter of the newly founded Federalist Society.<ref name = "chic">{{Citation

When [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected President in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration.  He was interviewed for the position of [[Solicitor General of the United States]], but the position went to [[Rex Lee]], to Scalia's great disappointment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=73<U+2013>74.}}</ref>  Scalia was offered a seat on the Chicago-based [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] in early 1982, but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] (D.C. Circuit).  Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=80.}}</ref> He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.<ref name=FJC>{{FJC Bio|2108|inline=1}}</ref>

On the D.C. Circuit, Scalia built a conservative record, while winning applause in legal circles for powerful, witty legal writing, which was often critical of the Supreme Court precedents he was bound as a lower-court judge to follow.  Scalia's opinions drew the attention of Reagan administration officials, who, according to ''The New York Times'', "liked virtually everything they saw and&nbsp;... listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect."<ref>{{Citation

Circuit Judge [[Robert Bork]], to be considered if a justice left the Court.  In 1986, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] informed the White House of his intent to retire.  Reagan first decided to nominate Associate Justice [[William Rehnquist]] to become Chief Justice.  This choice meant that Reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill Rehnquist's seat as associate justice<ref name = "nosmoke"/>.  Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]], who advised Reagan on the choice, only seriously considered Bork and Scalia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toobin|2008|p=21.}}</ref>   Feeling that this might well be Reagan's last opportunity to pick a Supreme Court justice, the President and his advisers chose Scalia over Bork as Scalia was ten years younger, and would likely serve longer on the Court.<ref name = "nosmoke"/>  Scalia also had the advantage of not having Bork's "paper trail";<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|p=24.}}</ref> the elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights.<ref>{{Citation

When [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings on Scalia's nomination opened in August 1986, he faced a committee which had just engaged in contentious wrangling over the Rehnquist nomination.  Witnesses and Democratic senators contended that Rehnquist, before becoming a judge, had engaged in activities designed to discourage minorities from voting.  Committee members had little taste for a second battle over Scalia, and were in any event reluctant to oppose the first Italian-American Supreme Court nominee.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=100.}}</ref>  The judge was not pressed heavily on controversial issues such as abortion or civil rights.<ref>{{Citation

Scalia met no opposition in the committee.  The full Senate debated Scalia's nomination only briefly, and he was confirmed, 98<U+2013>0, following Rehnquist's confirmation as Chief Justice by a vote of 65<U+2013>33.  One committee member, Democratic Delaware Senator (and future Vice President) [[Joe Biden]] later stated that he regretted not opposing Scalia "because he was so effective".<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=121.}}</ref>

==Legal philosophy and approach==
===Judicial performance===
During oral argument before the Court, Scalia asks more questions and makes more comments than any other justice<ref name = "auf">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=304<U+2013>305.}}</ref><U+2014>and a 2005 study found that he provokes laughter more often than any of his colleagues.<ref>{{Citation

[[Kansas University]] social psychologist Lawrence Wrightsman wrote of Scalia's style, "he communicates a sense of urgency on the bench, and his style is forever forceful".<ref name = "auf"/>  Since Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] joined the Court in 2005, he has taken to questioning counsel in a manner similar to Scalia's and sometimes the two question counsel in seeming coordination.<ref name = "oral"/>  [[Dahlia Lithwick]] of ''[[Slate]]'' described Scalia's technique:
<blockquote>
Scalia doesn't come into oral argument all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on the nuances of the case before him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle. He knows what the law is. He knows what the opinion should say. And he uses the hour allocated for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement.<ref>{{Citation

</blockquote> 

Scalia has, from the start of his career on the Supreme Court, written large numbers of opinions.  During his tenure, he has written more [[concurring opinion]]s than any other justice, and only two justices have written more [[dissenting opinion|dissents]].<ref name = "frosh">{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|p=27.}}</ref>  According to Kevin Ring, who compiled a book of Scalia's dissenting and concurring opinions, "His opinions are&nbsp;... highly readable.  His entertaining writing style can make even the most mundane areas of the law interesting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=xi.}}</ref>  Conor Clarke of ''Slate'' comments on Scalia's written opinions, especially his dissents:

<blockquote>
His writing style is best described as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions<U+2014>often very funny ones<U+2014>and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.<ref>{{Citation

</blockquote>

At the Supreme Court, justices meet after the case is briefed and argued, and vote on the result.  The task of writing the opinion is assigned by the Chief Justice, or if he is in the minority or not participating, by the senior justice in the majority.  After the assignment, the justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to each others' chambers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tushnet|2006|pp=64<U+2013>65.}}</ref> In the give and take of opinion writing, Scalia does not compromise his views in order to attract five votes for a majority (unlike the late Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] who would accept less than he wanted in order to gain a partial victory).<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=132.}}</ref>  Scalia attempts to influence his colleagues by sending them "Ninograms"<U+2014>short memoranda aimed at trying to get them to include his views in their opinions.<ref name = "frosh"/>

Scalia enjoys a warm relationship with fellow Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], a liberal, with the two attending the opera together, and even appearing together onstage as extras in [[Washington National Opera]]'s 1994 production of ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.<ref name = "auf"/>  Ginsburg was a colleague of Scalia's on the D.C. Circuit, and the Scalias and Ginsburgs have dinner together every New Year's Eve.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=88.}}</ref>

===Statutory and constitutional interpretation===

Scalia is an [[originalism|originalist]], meaning that he interprets the [[Constitution of the United States]] as it would have been understood to mean when it was adopted.  According to Scalia, "It's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution."<ref name = "sixty">{{Citation

Scalia's originalist approach has come under attack from critics, who contend that he only sees in the Constitution that which supports his personal beliefs.  Those critics have stated that Scalia's true agenda is to reverse the decisions of the [[Warren Court|Warren]] and Burger Courts, which shaped the law in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name = "sixty"/>  [[Ralph Nader]] has stated that Scalia's claim to an originalist philosophy is inconsistent with the justice's acceptance of the [[Corporate personhood debate|extension of certain constitutional rights to corporations]] when at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, corporations were not commonly understood to possess constitutional rights.<ref>{{Citation

Scalia, in his concurrence in that case, traced his understanding of the rights of corporations at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.  His argument is based on the lack of an exception for corporations in the free speech guarantee in the Bill of Rights, and on several examples of corporate political speech from the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.<ref>{{Citation

==Jurisprudence in practice==
===Governmental structure and powers===
====Separation of powers====
[[File:Obamacourt.jpg|right|alt=Nine judges in black robes pose for a photograph with three other men in suits.|thumb|The justices pose with President Obama, Vice President Biden, and retiring justice [[David Souter]], with Scalia fourth from right]]
It is Scalia's view that clear lines of separation among the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches follow directly from the Constitution, with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|pp=44<U+2013>45.}}</ref>  In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful<!-- word used by source --><U+2014>and solitary<U+2014>dissent in 1988's ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]'', in which the Court's majority upheld the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel law]].  Scalia's thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice Harry Blackmun for its emotional content; Blackmun felt it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted "the screaming".<ref name = "wolf">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=136<U+2013>38.}}</ref>  Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the Executive Branch by the Legislative.  He warned, "Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep<U+2019>s clothing&nbsp;... But this wolf comes as a wolf."<ref name = "wolf"/>

The 1989 case of ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'' challenged the [[United States Sentencing Commission]], an independent body within the Judicial Branch whose members (some of whom were federal judges) were removable only for good cause.  The petitioner argued that the arrangement violated separation of powers, and that the [[United States Sentencing Guidelines]] promulgated by the Commission were invalid.  Eight justices joined in the majority opinion written by Blackmun, upholding the Guidelines as constitutional.<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|pp=74<U+2013>75.}}</ref>  Scalia dissented, stating that the issuance of the Guidelines was a lawmaking function that Congress could not delegate,<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|p=76.}}</ref> and dubbed the Commission "a sort of junior-varsity Congress".<ref name = "wolf"/>

In 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act]] which allowed the President to cancel items from an [[appropriations bill]] (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law.  The statute was challenged the following year.  The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the [[Presentment Clause]] of the Constitution, which governs what the President may do with a bill once it has passed both Houses of Congress.<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|pp=78<U+2013>79.}}</ref>  Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers.  Scalia indicated that he felt that authorizing the President to cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.<ref>{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|pp=80<U+2013>82.}}</ref>

====Detainee cases====
In 2004, in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', the Court held that federal courts had [[subject-matter jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] to hear ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petitions brought by detainees at the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]].  Scalia accused the majority of "spring<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> a trap on the Executive" by ruling that it could hear cases involving persons at Guantanamo when no federal court had ever ruled that it had the authority to hear cases involving people there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskopic|2009|pp=328<U+2013>329.}}</ref>

Scalia also dissented in the 2004 case of ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'', involving [[Yaser Hamdi]], an American citizen detained in the United States on the allegation he was an [[enemy combatant]].  The Court held that the post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] congressional [[Authorization for the Use of Military Force]] (AUMF) amounted to authorization for the suspension of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' and the Government could continue to detain Hamdi.  Scalia wrote that the AUMF could not be read to suspend ''habeas corpus'' and that the Court, faced with legislation by Congress which did not grant the President power to detain Hamdi, was trying to "Make Everything Come Out Right".<!-- caps in original --><ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=84<U+2013>85.}}</ref>

In March 2006, Scalia gave a talk at the University of Fribourg, in Switzerland, where he was asked about detainee rights.  He responded, "Give me a break&nbsp;... I had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son, and I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial.  I mean it's crazy."<ref name = "bbc">{{Citation

  | accessdate = 2010-01-27}} (fee for article)</ref>

====Federalism====
In [[federalism]] cases, pitting the powers of the federal government against those of the states, Scalia has often taken the states' positions.  In 1997, the Supreme Court considered the case of ''[[Printz v. United States]]'', a challenge to certain provisions of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] which required chief law enforcement officers of localities in states to perform certain duties.  In ''Printz'', Scalia wrote the Court's majority decision.  The Supreme Court ruled the provision which imposed those duties unconstitutional as violating the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], which reserves to the states and to the people those powers not granted to the Federal Government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=61<U+2013>63.}}</ref>

Scalia has taken a broad view of the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]], which bars certain lawsuits against states in the federal courts.  In his 1989 dissent in ''[[Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.]]'', Scalia stated that there was no intent on the part of the Framers to have the states surrender any [[sovereign immunity]], and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'' came as a surprise to them.  Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment is actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=110<U+2013>112.}}</ref>

===Individual rights===
====Abortion====
Scalia has argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion, and that if the people desire legalized abortion, that a law should be passed to accomplish it.<ref name = "sixty"/>  Scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'',
<blockquote>
The States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.<ref>{{Citation

</blockquote>

Scalia has repeatedly called upon his colleagues to strike down ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.  Scalia hoped to find five votes to strike down ''Roe'' in the 1989 case of ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', but was not successful in doing so.  Justice [[Sandra O'Connor]] authored the decision of the Court, allowing the abortion regulations at issue in the case to stand, but not overriding ''Roe''. Scalia concurred only in part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=193<U+2013>195.}}</ref>  Scalia wrote that, "Justice O'Connor's assertion, that a 'fundamental rule of judicial restraint' requires us to avoid reconsidering ''Roe'', cannot be taken seriously."<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=108.}}</ref>  He noted, "We can now look forward to at least another Term of carts full of mail from the public, and the streets full of demonstrators."<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=109.}}</ref>

The Court returned to the issue of abortion in the 2000 case of ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing [[partial-birth abortion]].  Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional as it did not allow an exception for the health of the mother.  Scalia dissented, comparing the ''Stenberg'' case with two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history:  "I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court's jurisprudence beside ''[[Korematsu v. United States|Korematsu]]'' and ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]]''.  The method of killing a human child&nbsp;... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion."<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|pp=137<U+2013>138.}}</ref>  In 2007, the Court upheld a federal statute banning partial-birth abortion in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=202<U+2013>203.}}</ref>

University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone, a former faculty colleague of Scalia's criticized the ''Gonzales'' decision, suggesting in an article that religion had influenced the outcome, as all five justices in the majority were Catholic, while the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish.  This has angered Scalia to such an extent that he has stated he will not speak at the University of Chicago so long as Stone is there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=203<U+2013>204.}}</ref>

====Race, gender, and sexual orientation====
Scalia has generally voted to strike down laws which make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation.  In 1989, he concurred with the Court's judgment in ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'', in which the Court applied [[strict scrutiny]] to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program.  Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however.  He disagreed with O'Connor's opinion, for the Court, that states and localities could institute race-based programs, if they identified past discrimination, and if the program was designed to remedy the past racism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|pp=87<U+2013>88.}}</ref>  Five years later, in ''[[Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe<U+00F1>a]]''  he concurred in the Court's judgment and in part with the opinion which extended strict scrutiny to Federal programs.  Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences,
<blockquote>
To pursue the concept of racial entitlement <U+2013> even for the most admirable and benign of purposes <U+2013> is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|pp=56<U+2013>57.}}</ref>
</blockquote>
In the 2003 case of ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', involving racial preferences in the [[University of Michigan]]'s law school, Scalia mocked<!-- so says the source --> the Court majority's finding that the school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions so as to promote diversity, and to increase "cross-racial understanding".  Scalia noted,
<blockquote>This is not, of course, an "educational benefit" on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B+) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding). For it is a lesson of life rather than law<U+2014>essentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be "taught" in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=159<U+2013>60.}}</ref></blockquote>

Scalia has argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to [[intermediate scrutiny]], requiring that the gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=194.}}</ref>  When, in 1996, the Court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in the case of ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', Scalia filed a lone, lengthy dissent.  Scalia felt that the Court, in requiring Virginia to show an "extremely persuasive justification" for the single-sex admissions policy, had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way "that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny".<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=195.}}</ref>

In one of the final decisions of the Burger Court, the Court ruled in 1986 in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' that homosexual sodomy was not protected by the [[right of privacy]] and could be criminally prosecuted by the States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|pp=279<U+2013>80.}}</ref>  In 1995, however, that ruling was effectively gutted by ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment, passed by popular vote, which forbade anti-discrimination laws being extended to sexual preference.<ref name = "as">{{Harvnb|Tushnet|2006|pp=167<U+2013>169.}}</ref>  Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy, believing that ''Bowers'' had protected the right of the states to pass such measures, and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory, but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|pp=280<U+2013>81.}}</ref>  Scalia later said of ''Romer'', "And the Supreme Court said, 'Yes, it is unconstitutional.'  On the basis of<U+2014>I don't know, the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights, presumably.  And the liberals loved it, and the conservatives gnashed their teeth."<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=283.  There is no such clause in the Bill of Rights.}}</ref>

In 2003, ''Bowers'' was formally reversed by ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', from which Scalia dissented.  During the oral argument in the case, Scalia, according to [[Mark V. Tushnet]] in his survey of the Rehnquist Court, seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened, "Maybe we should go through counsel."<ref>{{Harvnb|Tushnet|2006|pp=170<U+2013>72.}}</ref>  In his dissent, Scalia ridiculed<!-- so sayeth Biskopic --> the majority for being so ready to cast aside ''Bowers'' when many of the same justices had refused to overturn ''Roe'' in ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=225<U+2013>27.}}</ref>

====Criminal law====

[[File:Supreme_Court_building_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG|right|alt=A large white stone governmental building with a large glight of stairs leading to a pillared portico; a flagpole with a US flag at half mast is seen.|thumb|The Supreme Court building, Washington DC]]
As the Constitution contains mention of the death penalty, Scalia deems it constitutional and opposes attempts to declare it unconstitutional.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=144.}}</ref>  He also opposes efforts to declare the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups, such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense.  In ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]]'' (1988), he dissented from the Court's ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 at the time of the offense, and the following year authored the Court's opinion in ''[[Stanford v. Kentucky]]'' sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16.  However, in 2004, the Court overturned ''Stanford'' in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' and Scalia again dissented, mocking the majority's claims that a national consensus had emerged against the execution of those who killed while underage, and noting that less than half of the states which permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers.   He castigated the majority for including in their count states which had abolished the death penalty entirely, stating that doing so was "rather like including old-order Amishmen in a consumer-preference poll on the electric car.  Of course they don't like it, but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue."<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=192<U+2013>93.}}</ref>  In 2002, in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to the mentally retarded.  Scalia dissented, stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute the mildly mentally retarded at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights, and that the Court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against the practice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ring|2004|p=148.}}</ref>

Scalia strongly disfavors the Court's ruling in ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', which held that a confession by an arrested suspect who had not been [[Miranda warnings|advised of his rights]] was inadmissible in court, and voted to overrule ''Miranda'' in the 2000 case of ''[[Dickerson v. United States]]'', but was in a minority of two with Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].  Calling the ''Miranda'' decision a "milestone of judicial overreaching", Scalia stated that the Court should not fear to correct its mistakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toobin|2008|p=146.}}</ref>

While in many areas, Scalia's approach is unfavorable to criminal defendants, he has taken the side of defendants in matters involving the [[Confrontation Clause]] of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]], which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers.  In multiple cases, Scalia has written against laws which allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=182<U+2013>84.}}</ref>  In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'', holding that defendants must have the opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases; a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was drugs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=354.}}</ref>

Scalia maintains that every [[Element (criminal law)|element]] of an offense which helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury, under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee.  In the 2000 case of ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion which struck down a state statute which allowed the trial judge, upon conviction, to enhance the sentence if he found that the offense was a [[hate crime]].  Scalia, for the Court, found the procedure impermissible as the question of whether it was a hate crime had not been decided by a jury.<ref name = "coy"/>  In 2004, he wrote for the Court in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds.  The dissenters in ''Blakely'' foresaw that Scalia would use the case to next attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in ''Mistretta''), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in ''[[United States v. Booker]]'' which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained in an advisory capacity).<ref name = "coy">{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=184<U+2013>86.}}</ref>

In the 2001 case of ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', Scalia wrote the Court's opinion in a 5<U+2013>4 decision that cut across ideological lines.<ref>Scalia was joined by Justices Thomas, Souter, Breyer, and Ginsburg.</ref>  That decision found thermal imaging of a home to be a search for purposes of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.  The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the rest of the house, because of, as it proved, indoor growing lights.<ref>{{Citation

  | accessdate = 2010-01-24 }}</ref>  Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in ''[[County of Riverside v. McLaughlin]]'', allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as was practicable.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|p=175.}}</ref>  In a 1990 [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] case, ''[[R.A.V. v. St. Paul]]'', Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] [[hate speech]] ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tushnet|2006|pp=140<U+2013>42.}}</ref>  Scalia noted, "Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible.  But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire."<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|p=2.}}</ref>

===Other cases===
Scalia joined the majority ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion in the 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which effectively ended recounts of ballots in Florida following the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 US Presidential election]], and also both concurred separately and joined Rehnquist's concurrence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=243.}}</ref>  In 2007, he said of the case, "I and my court owe no apology whatever for ''Bush v.

Scalia concurred in the 1990 case of ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'' in which the family of [[Nancy Cruzan|a woman]] in a [[vegetative state]] sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die, believing that to have been her wish.  The Court found for the State of Missouri, requiring [[clear and convincing evidence]] of such a desire.  Scalia stated that the Court should have remained away from the dispute, and that the issues "are<nowiki>[not]</nowiki> better known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory".<ref name="second">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=135<U+2013>136.}}</ref>

In 2008, the Court considered a challenge to the gun laws in the [[District of Columbia]].  Scalia wrote the majority opinion in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which found an individual right to own a firearm under the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].  Scalia traced the word "militia", found in the Second Amendment, as it would have been understood at the time of its ratification, and stated that it then meant "the body of all citizens".<ref name="second"/>  The Court upheld Heller's claim to own a firearm in the District.<ref name="second"/>

Scalia's opinion for the ''Heller'' Court was widely criticized by liberals, and applauded by conservatives.<ref name="second">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=347<U+2013>351.}}</ref>  However, Seventh Circuit judge [[Richard Posner]], a conservative, disagreed with Scalia's opinion, stating that the Second Amendment "creates no right to the private possession of guns".  Posner called Scalia's opinion "faux originalism" and a "historicizing glaze on personal values and policy preferences".<ref>{{Citation

===Requests for recusals===

Scalia [[recusal|recused]] himself in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]],'' a claim brought by atheist [[Michael Newdow]] alleging the recitation of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] (including the words "under God") in school classrooms, violated the rights of his daughter, whom he said was also an atheist.  Shortly after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that there was a rights violation, Scalia, speaking at a [[Knights of Columbus]] event in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], stated that the Ninth Circuit decision was an example of how the courts were trying to excise God from public life.  The school district requested that the Supreme Court review the case, and Newdow asked that Scalia recuse himself, which he did, without comment.<ref>{{Citation

Scalia refused to recuse himself in  ''[[Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]'' (2005), a case concerning whether Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] could keep secret the membership of an advisory task force on energy policy. Scalia was asked to recuse because he had gone on a hunting trip with various persons including Cheney, during which he travelled, one way, on [[Air Force Two]].  Scalia refused to recuse himself, stating that though Cheney was a longtime friend, he was merely being sued in his official capacity, and that were justices to step aside in the cases of officials who are parties because of official capacity, the Supreme Court would cease to function.  Scalia indicated that it was far from unusual for justices to socialize with other government officials, recalling that the late Chief Justice, [[Fred M. Vinson]] played poker with President [[Harry Truman]] and that Justice [[Byron White]] went skiing with Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]].  Scalia stated that he was never alone with Cheney during the trip, the two had not discussed the case, and the justice had saved no money since he had bought round-trip tickets, the cheapest available.<ref>{{Citation

===Faith===
Scalia resides in [[McLean, Virginia]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=211.}}</ref> and is a devout, traditionalist Catholic.  Uncomfortable with the changes in the Church caused by [[Vatican II]], Scalia prefers the Latin Mass and in both Chicago and Washington, has driven long distances to parishes which he felt were more in accord with his beliefs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=40<U+2013>41, 73.}}</ref>

In 2006, Scalia, approached by a reporter upon leaving church, was asked if being a traditional Catholic had caused problems for him.  He responded by asking, "You know what I say to those people?", and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out.  The gesture, which was captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' as obscene.  Scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off.  Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning "I've had enough, go away" and noted, "It's a fairly strong gesture."<ref>{{Citation

After nearly a quarter century on the Court, and now past the age of seventy, Scalia characterizes his victories as "Damn few".<ref name = "decade">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=363.}}</ref>  His biographer, [[Joan Biskupic]], speculates that Scalia, given good health, may remain on the court for another decade.<ref name = "decade"/>

While Scalia is widely admired among conservatives, many liberals dislike his views.  In March 2009, Congressman [[Barney Frank]], who is gay, described Scalia as a "homophobe".<ref>{{Citation

<blockquote>
He's so Old School, he's Old Testament, misty over the era when military institutes did not have to accept women, when elite schools did not have to make special efforts with blacks, when a gay couple in their own bedroom could be clapped in irons, when women were packed off to Our Lady of Perpetual Abstinence Home for Unwed Mothers&nbsp;...

Rossum, writing in 2006, before the [[George W. Bush]] appointees to the Supreme Court had time to make an impact, that Scalia had failed to win converts among his conservative colleagues for his use of originalism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|p=198.}}</ref>  Bush appointees Roberts and Alito, however, are younger men who take an originalist approach, and who greatly admire Scalia and the manner in which he battles for that in which he believes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=275.}}</ref> 

Scalia's dislike of legislative history has caused Members of Congress to be more cautious in its use.<ref name = "leghist"/>  Gregory Maggs wrote in the ''Public Interest Law Review'' in 1995 that by the early 1990s, legislative history was being cited in only about forty percent of Supreme Court cases involving the interpretation of statutes, and no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome.  Maggs suggested,

<blockquote>With Justice Scalia breathing down the necks of anyone who peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, the other members of the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs. It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically. No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.<ref name = "leghist">{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|p=44.}}</ref></blockquote>
