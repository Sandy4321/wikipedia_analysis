'''Upper Clyde Shipbuilders''' (UCS) was a British [[shipbuilding]] [[consortium]] created in 1968 as a result of the amalgamation of five major shipbuilders of the [[River Clyde]] in Scotland. It entered [[liquidation]] amidst much controversy in 1971, leading to a famous "[[work-in]]" at the company's [[Shipyard]]s, led by [[shop steward]] [[Jimmy Reid]].

==History==
===Formation===
The Company was formed in February 1968 from the amalgamation of five major Upper Clyde Shipbuilding firms: [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfields]] in [[Govan]] (Govan Division), [[Alexander Stephens and Sons]] in [[Linthouse]] (Linthouse Division), [[Charles Connell and Company]] in [[Scotstoun]] (Scotstoun Division) and [[John Brown and Company]] at [[Clydebank]] (Clydebank Division), as well as an associate subsidiary, [[Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd]], in which UCS held a controlling stake of 51%.<ref name=archive>[http://cheshire.cent.gla.ac.uk/ead/search/?operation=full&rsid=15528&firstrec=1&numreq=20&highlight=1&hitposition=1 University of Glasgow Archives]</ref> 

This consolidation came about as a result of ''Geddes Report'', published in 1966 and the subsequent ''Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967'', which recommended rationalisation and [[horizontal integration]] of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom into large regional groups, aided with grants from the state Shipbuilding Industry Board, in order to achieve [[economies of scale]] and better compete in the market for increasingly large [[merchant vessel]]s like [[VLCC]]s. The creation of these groupings included [[Scott Lithgow]] on the [[Lower Clyde]], [[Swan Hunter]] on [[Tyneside]] and [[Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company|Robb Caledon]] on the east coast of Scotland.<ref>[http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/313523_906484679_758925132.pdf Strategies of Growth, Diversification and Rationalization in the Evolution of Concentration in British Shipbuilding, D. Todd, 1983]</ref> The government had a 48.4% minority holding in the consortium and provided a <U+00A3>5.5m interest free government loan over the first three years. UCS had a combined order book at the time worth <U+00A3>87m.<ref>[http://www.gcu.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/ucs_workin.html Glasgow Caledonian University Archives]</ref>

===Collapse of UCS===
In June 1971 the loss-making Upper Clyde Shipbuilders went into receivership (only one yard of the five, [[Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd]], remained profitable and had left the joint venture in April 1970). In February 1971, in the wake of the emergency nationalisation of [[Rolls-Royce Limited]], the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under [[Edward Heath]] and the [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], [[John Davies (businessman)|John Davies]], announced a policy that refused further state-support for "lame duck" industries, which led to a crisis of confidence amongst UCS [[creditors]] and resulted in severe [[cash flow]] problems for the company. After the government refused UCS a <U+00A3>6m [[working capital]] loan as a [[lender of last resort]], the company was forced to enter liquidation, despite the yards having a full orderbook and a forecasted profit in 1972.<ref>[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?Itemid=635&id=374&option=com_content&task=view Modern Shandon shipbuilding boss] Helensborough Heritage, 29 December 2008</ref>

===Union strategy===
Rather than go on strike, which was the traditional form of industrial action, the union leadership decided to have a "[[work-in]]" and complete the orders that the shipyards had in place.<ref name=archive/>  In this way they dispelled the idea of the workers being 'work-shy' and also wanted to illustrate the long-term viability of the yards and the [[Right to work]].

The work-in was led by a group of young shop stewards, including [[Jimmy Reid]], Jimmy Airlie and Sammy Barr all of whom were then members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref>http://www.gcal.ac.uk/archives/ucs/documents/UCS.pdf</ref>  They ran a well organised campaign in which the shop stewards in each yard remained firmly in charge.  Reid wanted to ensure the workers projected the best image of the yard workers he possibly could, and insisted on tight discipline.  He famously addressed the workers at the yards where he instructed them that there should be "no hooliganism, no vandalism and no bevvying (drinking)".<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/comment/There-WILL-be-bevvying-.2343785.jp There will be bevvying] The Scotsman, 16 July 2002</ref>

===Support===
Reid's tactics worked and public sympathy in the [[Glasgow]] area and beyond was on the side of the workers who took part.  This was backed up with demonstrations in Glasgow, one of which was attended by around 80,000 marchers.<ref>[http://www.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-000-467-830-C Scran database]</ref>  At one demonstration, on [[Glasgow Green]], [[Tony Benn]] addressed those in attendance, and [[Matt McGinn]] and [[Billy Connolly]] (both former shipyard workers) offered entertainment to the gathered crowd. The campaign was also well backed financially, and at one meeting for the campaign Jimmy Reid was able to announce that the campaign had received a <U+00A3>5,000 contribution from [[John Lennon|Lennon]], to which an attendee replied "but [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] deid! (dead)".<ref>[http://www.sunnygovan.com/PLACES/Clyde/FightingSpirit.html Fighting Spirit of the Clyde]</ref>

===Aftermath===
In February 1972 Heath's government relented and restructured the yards around two new companies: [[Govan Shipbuilders]] was established (formerly Fairfields) along with its subsidiary [[Scotstoun Marine Ltd]] (formerly Connells), [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]] had already withdrawn from UCS in April 1970 and regained its status as an independent company (until 1977, when it was nationalised as part of [[British Shipbuilders]], along with Govan Shipbuilders). A fourth yard at Clydebank (formerly John Brown) was sold to [[Marathon Oil]], which eventually closed in 2001.<ref name=archive/> The former [[Alexander Stephens and Sons]] yard at Linthouse was closed in 1972 after the liquidation of UCS.

Two major shipyards on the Upper Clyde (the former Yarrow and Fairfields yards) remain in operation: as [[BAE Systems Surface Ships]], owned by the defence contractor [[BAE Systems]], focusing principally upon the design and construction of technologically advanced warships for the [[Royal Navy]] and other navies around the world.

Some commentators have remarked though that the work-in was hugely successful at halting the [[laissez-faire]], [[free-market]] ideas that many in the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government wanted to implement (and which the later [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] Conservative government would go on to do).<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VxQxFMV_3IUC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=Upper+clyde+work-in+laissez-faire&source=bl&ots=vnaJ4YWzEx&sig=TLI9SPG8NxoaeVXz8Sgty0anEwE&hl=en&ei=_g3-SdHIOqG5jAf8prCZAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2 Hollowell, Jonathan, ''Britain since 1945'', Page 45]</ref>
