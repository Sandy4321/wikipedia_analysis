'''Magnum Rolle''' (born February 23, 1986) is a [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] basketball player who plays in the [[NBA]] for the [[Indiana Pacers]]. Born in [[Freeport, Bahamas]], Rolle did not play basketball until his [[freshman]] year in high school. His coach at St. George's High School, Darrel Sears, bribed him with fried chicken to teach Rolle the fundamentals of basketball. After his senior year at St. George's, Rolle transferred to the [[Laurinburg Institute]], where he was an integral part in leading the team to an undefeated record and the national prep school championship. He was considered a five-star prospect out of Laurinburg, and commited to play at [[Louisiana State University]].

At LSU, Rolle came off the bench on a team that reached the Final Four in his freshman campaign. After his [[sophomore]] year, he transferred to [[Louisiana Tech University|Louisiana Tech]] in 2007 and was forced to [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]]ing the [[2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007<U+2013>08 season]]. While a [[junior (education)|junior]], Rolle tripled his points per game average from 4.0 to 12.2. He was named to the All-[[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] (Western Athletic Conference) Defensive Team and All-WAC Newcomer Team. In his [[senior (education)|senior]] year, he led the WAC in blocks and finished fourth in career blocked shots at Louisiana Tech despite playing only two seasons. Rolle graduated from Louisiana Tech with a bachelor's degree in [[sociology]] in March 2010, becoming the first person in his family to earn a degree. He was drafted with the 51st pick of the [[2010 NBA Draft]] by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] and subsequently traded to the Indiana Pacers. 

==Early life==
Rolle was born on February 23, 1986 in [[Freeport, Bahamas]].<ref name=LSU>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=185995|title=Magnum Rolle Bio|work=[[LSU Tigers]]|publisher=[[Louisiana State University]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> His mother is Maryse Rolle, a painter, and he has three siblings.<ref name=MinCongrat>{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Lewis|url=http://www.tribune242.com/sports/07152010_MagnumCelebrated_sports|title=Ministers congratulate Magnum Rolle on NBA achievement|work=Bahamas Information Services|publisher=[[The Bahamas Tribune]]|date=July 15, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref> He was named after [[Tom Selleck]]'s TV show [[Magnum, P.I.]]<ref>{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Dufresne|coauthors=Robyn Norwood, Diane Pucin, Steve Springer|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/01/sports/sp-finalnotes1|title=Hollins Is Hurt but Will Play|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|page=D10|date=April 1, 2006|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> He can trace his ancestry to freed slaves and is a distant cousin of [[NFL]] players [[Myron Rolle|Myron]], [[Antrel Rolle|Antrel]], and [[Samari Rolle]].<ref>{{cite news|first=S.L.|last=Price|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114456/index.htm|title=Rolle Call|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|date=December 10, 2007|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> 

Originally a [[association football|soccer]] player,<ref name=LSU/> Rolle did not pick up a basketball until he was 14, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw how tall Rolle was. Sears asked if he knew how to play; Rolle said no. Sears threw him a ball and asked the young man to shoot from the foul line. His first shot, according to Rolle, completely jumped the backboard and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was disinterested in the game and only came to coach Sears's practices because he received free fried chicken out of the deal.<ref name=Freeport>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Coakley|url=http://freeport.nassauguardian.net/sports/359898352218658.php|title=Magnum Drafted in NBA|work=[[The Freeport News]]|date=June 26, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref>

==High school and prep school career==
At St. George's High School in Freeport, Rolle quickly developed his basketball skills and competed in [[track and field]] events. He shot an average of 20.3 points per game and grabbed 13.6 rebounds per game while enrolled at that school.<ref name=LSU/> Rolle first dreamed of playing in the [[NBA]] when he was 16 years old, after he came back from a basketball camp in [[Arkansas]].<ref name=Freeport/> However, he had some academic issues to work out. Rolle's [[grade point average]] was 1.0 early in his career at St. George's, forcing him to repeat ninth and tenth grade. Due to a drive to succeed academically and athletically, he eventually raised his GPA to 3.0.<ref name=destiny>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Coakley|url=http://freeport.nassauguardian.net/sports/313280423310184.php|title=When destiny and fate cross paths|work=[[The Freeport News]]|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

In 2003, following his senior year at St. George's, Rolle attended the Nike All-America Camp and convinced his mother to let him attend a [[preparatory school]] in the United States, where he could showcase his abilities and hone his talents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n38/NikeCamp-en.html|title=Nike Camp Gets International Flavor|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Puerto Rico Herald]]|date=July 7, 2003|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> They eventually settled on the [[Laurinburg Institute]], a small school in North Carolina founded in 1904. The school's gymnasium was condemned in 1997, and the basketball team was forced to play home games as far as 30 miles away.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/12098742/|title=Tiny prep school well represented at NCAAs|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=April 1, 2006|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> Despite these challenges, in Rolle's only year at the institute his team went 40<U+2013>0 and won the national prep school championship. Under head coach Chris Chaney, Rolle recorded a per-game average of 10.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 4.5 blocked shots and had a field goal and free throw percentage of 64 percent and 76 percent, respectively.<ref name=LSU/>

Rolle also played with the Arkansas Wings on the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) circuit while at the Laurinburg Institute. He received scholarship offers from [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]], [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]], and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]].

====Freshman====
On November 18, 2005, in an 84<U+2013>56 defeat of [[Southern Jaguars|Southern University]], Rolle made his collegiate debut, playing 14 minutes and scoring six points while also grabbing three rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=253220099|title=Southern University Jaguars vs. LSU Tigers -- Box Score|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=November 18, 2005|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Rolle's season high in rebounds (10) and points (8) while shooting 4-of-8 from the field helped lead LSU past [[Nicholls State University|Nicholls State]] on November 21.

Despite this performance, LSU's opponent [[2005<U+2013>06 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] ultimately prevailed, 59<U+2013>45.<ref>{{cite news|first=Fred|last=Sturrup|url=http://www.jonesbahamas.com/?c=123&a=8304|title=Magnum Rolle Comes Of Age!|work=[[The Bahama Journal]]|date=April 3, 2006|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Over the course of the [[2005-06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], Rolle averaged 2.2 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 8.7 minutes per game as a freshman, picking up 21 blocks on the year.<ref name=LSU/>

====Sophomore====
Coming into the [[2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006<U+2013>07 season]], the Tigers returned four starters, including [[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen "Big Baby" Davis]], and LSU fans hoped that Rolle would replace the shot blocking of [[Tyrus Thomas]]. As such, [[Andy Katz]] of ESPN named them the fifth best team in the nation in the preseason.<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Katz|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2491073|title=ESPN.com 2006-07 June Top 25 (1-10)|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=June 19, 2006|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Rolle's averages improved slightly to 4.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 16.7 minutes per contest, with nine starts and 31 blocks.

Rolle decided to leave the LSU program on May 23.
