'''Tbilisi''' ({{IPA2|<U+02CC>tbi<U+02C8>li<U+02D0>si}}, in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: <U+10D7><U+10D1><U+10D8><U+10DA><U+10D8><U+10E1><U+10D8>), is the [[capital city|capital]] and the largest city of [[Georgia (country)|the Republic of Georgia]], lying on the banks of the Mt'k'vari ([[Kura River|Kura]]) River. The name is derived from an early Georgian form ''Tpilisi'' and it was officially known as <U+0422><U+0438><U+0444><U+043B><U+0438><U+0441> ('''Tiflis''') in Russian, until 1936. <ref>{{cite book|first=E.M.|last= Pospelov|title=Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira|location=Moscow|year=1998|pages= 412}}.</ref> The city covers an area of 726&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (280.3 square miles) and has 1,093,000 inhabitants.

Founded in the 5th century [[AD]] by [[Vakhtang Gorgasali]], the Georgian King of [[Kartli]] ([[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]), and made into a capital in the 6th century, Tbilisi is a significant [[industry|industrial]], [[social]], and [[cultural]] center. The city is also emerging as an important transit route for global energy and trade projects. Located strategically at the crossroads between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] and lying along the historic [[Silk Road]] routes, Tbilisi has often been the point of contention between various rivaling powers and empires. The history of the city can be seen by its architecture, where the [[Baron Haussmann|Haussmannized]] Rustaveli Avenue and downtown are blended with the narrower streets of the medieval [[Narikala]] district.

The demographics of the city is diverse and historically it has been home to peoples from different cultures, religions and ethnicities. Despite being overwhelmingly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]], Tbilisi is one of the few places in the world ([[Sarajevo]] and [[Paramaribo]] being another) where a synagogue and a mosque are located next to each other, in the ancient [[Abanotubani|Bath]] district several hundred meters from the [[Metekhi]] Church. In recent times, Tbilisi has become known for the peaceful [[Rose Revolution]], which took place around [[Tavisuplebis Moedani, Tbilisi|Freedom Square]] and nearby locations after the contested [[parliamentary]] elections of 2003 led to the resignation of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[President]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze]].

Tbilisi has [[Tbilisi International Airport|one international airport]]. Notable tourist destinations include [[Tbilisi Sameba Cathedral]], [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Freedom Square]], [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral|Sioni Cathedral]], [[Metekhi]], [[Narikala]], [[Parliament of Georgia]], [[Rustaveli Avenue]], [[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre]], [[Anchiskhati Basilica]], [[Mtatsminda]] (Holy Mountain), [[Kashveti|Kashveti Church]] along with the National and Historic Museums of Georgia and numbers of art galleries. Tbilisi is the home of famous artists. The city life was immortalized in their art by [[Niko Pirosmani]] and [[Lado Gudiashvili]].

==History==
{{main|History of Tbilisi}}

===Early history===
According to an old legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458 AD. One widely accepted variant of the legend of Tbilisi's founding states that King [[Vakhtang I Gorgasali]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a [[falcon]] (sometimes the falcon is either substituted by a [[hawk]] or other small [[birds of prey]] in the legend). The King's [[falcon]] allegedly caught/injured a [[pheasant]] during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby [[hot spring]] and died (from the burns received in the hot water). King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to cut down the forest and build a city on the location. The name ''Tbilisi'' derives from the [[Georgian language|Old Georgian]] word "Tpili", meaning warm. The name ''Tbili'' or ''Tbilisi'' ("warm location") therefore was given to the city because of the area's numerous [[sulfuric]] [[hot springs]] that came out of the ground.
[[Image:Rustaveli Avenue.jpg|thumb|300px|left| Night on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] , Tbilisi]]
Archaeological studies of the region have revealed that the territory of Tbilisi was settled by humans as early as the 4th millennium B.C. The earliest actual (recorded) accounts of settlement of the location come from the second half of the 4th century AD, when a fortress was built during King [[Varaz-Bakur]]'s reign. Towards the end of the 4th century the fortress fell into the hands of the [[Persians]] after which the location fell back into the hands of the Kings of [[Kartli]] (Georgia) by the middle of the 5th century AD. King [[Vakhtang I Gorgasali]] (reigned in the middle and latter halves of the 5th century) who is largely credited for founding Tbilisi was actually responsible for reviving and building up the city and not founding it. The present-day location of the area which Gorgasali seems to have built up is spread out around the [[Metekhi]] cliff and the latter-day [[Abanot-Ubani]] neighborhood.

[[Image:Tbilisi balconies.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Balconies in Old Tbilisi are very distinctive in style]]

===Role as capital===
King [[Dachi of Iberia|Dachi I Ujarmeli]] (beginning of the 6th century AD), who was the successor of [[Vakhtang I Gorgasali]], moved the capital from [[Mtskheta]] to Tbilisi according to the will left by his father. It must be mentioned that Tbilisi was not the capital of a unified Georgian state at that time (therefore did not include the territory of [[Colchis]]) and was only the capital of [[Eastern Georgia]]/[[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. During his reign, King [[Dachi I]] was also responsible for finishing the construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. Beginning from the 6th century, Tbilisi started to grow at a steady pace due to the region's favorable and strategic location which placed the city along important trade and travel routes between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

===Foreign domination===
Tbilisi's favorable and strategic location did not necessarily bode well for its existence as [[Eastern Georgia]]'s/[[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia's]] capital. Located strategically in the heart of the [[Caucasus]] between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], Tbilisi became an object of rivalry between the region's various powers such as [[Persia]], The [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Arabia]], and the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The [[cultural]] development of the city was therefore heavily dependent on who ruled the city at various times. Even though Tbilisi (and Eastern Georgia in general) was able to maintain a certain degree of autonomy from its conquerors, the foreign domination of the city began in the latter half of the 6th century and lasted well into the 10th century AD.

From 570-580 A.D., the [[Persians]] took over Tbilisi and ruled it for about a decade. In the year 627 A.D., [[Third Perso-Turkic War|Tbilisi was sacked]] by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]/[[Khazar]] armies and later, in 736-738, Arab armies entered the town under [[Marwan II|Marwan II Ibn-Muhammad]]. After this point, the [[Arabs]] established an [[Emirate of Tbilisi|emirate]] centered in Tbilisi. It must be noted that the Arab domination brought a certain order to the region and introduced a more formal/modernized judicial system into [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 764, Tbilisi, still under [[Arab]] control was once again sacked by the [[Khazars]]. In 853 AD, the armies of Arab leader [[Bugha Al-Turki]] (Bugha the Turk) invaded Tbilisi in order to establish a [[Caliphate]].{{Clarifyme|date=August 2008}}<!-- What is meant here? Was there a "Caliphate of Tbilisi"? --> The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050 AD. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the [[Seljuk Turks]] under [[Sultan]] [[Alp Arslan]].

[[Image:Tiflis.jpg|thumb|250px|Tbilisi, ca. 1890-1900.]]

===Tbilisi as the capital of a unified Georgian state===
In 1122, after heavy fighting with the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuks]] that involved at least 60,000 [[Georgian people|Georgians]] and up to 300,000 [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], the troops of the King of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[David the Builder]] entered Tbilisi. After the battles for Tbilisi concluded, David moved his residence from [[Kutaisi]] (Western Georgia) to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State. From 12-13th centuries, Tbilisi became a dominant regional power with a thriving economy (with well-developed trade and skilled labour) and a well-established social system/structure. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 80,000. The city also became an important [[literary]] and a [[cultural]] center not only for [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] but for the larger [[civilized]] world as well. During [[Queen Tamar]]'s reign, [[Shota Rustaveli]] worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]''. This period is often referred to as "Georgia's Golden Age"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgianbiography.com/history4.html|publisher=Dictionary of Georgian National Biography|title=The Golden Age Of Georgia|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> or the Georgian [[Renaissance]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investingeorgia.info/georgia_profile/country_overview/|title=Country Overview|publisher=Invest in Georgia|accessdate=2008-02-02|quote=This early Georgian renaissance ... preceded its European analogue by several hundred years}}</ref>.
[[Image:Tbilis view11.jpg|thumb|200px|left|View of Tbilisi.]]

===Mongol domination and the following period of instability===
Tbilisi's "Golden Age" did not last for more than a century. In 1226 Tbilisi was captured by the refugee [[Khwarezmian Empire]] Khwarezmian Shah [[Mingburnu]] and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236 A.D., after suffering crushing defeats to the [[Mongols]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] came under [[Mongol invasions of Georgia|Mongol domination]]. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols were forcefully expelled from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the [[Black Death|plague]] struck the city in 1366.

From the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|invaded]] by the armies of [[Tamerlane]] (Timur). In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by [[Jahan Shah]] (the Shah of the town of [[Tabriz]] in [[Persia]]). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the [[Ak Koyunlu]] tribesmen of [[Uzun Hassan]]. In 1522 A.D., Tbilisi came under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] control but was later freed in 1524 by King [[David X of Kartli|David X]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. From the 17-18th centuries, Tbilisi once again became the object of rivalry only this time between the [[Ottoman Turks]] and [[Persia]]. King [[Erekle II]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] tried on several occasions, successfully, to free Tbilisi from Persian rule but in the end Tbilisi was burnt to the ground in 1795 by [[Agha Mohammad Khan|Shah Agha-Mohammad Khan]]. At this point, sensing that Georgia could not hold up against [[Persia]] alone, Erekle sought the help of [[Russia]].

===Tbilisi under Russian control===
[[Image:Tiflis COA.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The coat of arms of Tiflis under Russian rule.]]
In 1801, after the Georgian kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] joined the [[Russian Empire]], Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). From the beginning of the 19th century Tbilisi started to grow economically and politically. New buildings mainly of [[Europe]]an style were erected throughout the town. New roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in [[Russia]] and other parts of the [[Transcaucasus]] (locally) such as [[Batumi]], [[Poti]], [[Baku]], and [[Yerevan]]. By the 1850s Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of [[Ilia Chavchavadze]], [[Akaki Tsereteli]], [[Iakob Gogebashvili]], [[Aleksandr Griboyedov]] and many other statesmen, poets, and artists all found their home in Tbilisi.

[[Image:Red Army in Tbilisi Feb 25 1921.jpg|thumb|The 11th Red Army of the [[Russian SFSR]] occupies Tbilisi, [[25 February]] [[1921]].|250px]]
The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], the [[Romanov]] Family and others. The [[Romanov]] Family established their residence (in [[Transcaucasia]]) on [[Golovin Street]] (Present-day [[Rustaveli Avenue]]).

Throughout the century, the political, economic and cultural role of Tbilisi with its ethnic, confessional and cultural diversity ([[Armenians]], [[Georgians]] and [[Russians]] comprised 38.1, 26.3 and 24.8 percent of the population respectively in 1897<ref><U+042D><U+043D><U+0446><U+0438><U+043A><U+043B><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0434><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0411><U+0440><U+043E><U+043A><U+0433><U+0430><U+0443><U+0437><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+0415><U+0444><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430> (''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]''), <U+0422><U+0438><U+0444><U+043B><U+0438><U+0441> (''Tiflis''), 1890-1907</ref>) was significant not only for Georgia but for the whole Caucasus. Hence, Tbilisi took on a different look. It acquired different architectural monuments and the attributes of an international city, as well as its own urban folklore and language, and the specific ''Tbilisuri'' (literally, belonging to Tbilisi) culture.

===Independence: 1918<U+2013>1921===
After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the city served as a location of the [[Transcaucasus]] interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent [[Transcaucasian Federation]] with the capital in Tbilisi. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasian nations <U+2013> Georgia, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] <U+2013> was declared on May 26 to 28 1918. Since then, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] until [[25 February]] [[1921]]. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a [[German Empire|German]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] military headquarters.

Under the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian [[University City]] after the [[Tbilisi State University]] was founded in 1918, a long-time dream of the Georgians banned by the [[Imperial Russia]]n authorities for several decades.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Marshall|authorlink=David Marshall Lang|year=1962|title=History of Modern Georgia|pages=211}}.</ref> On [[25 February]] [[1921]], the [[Bolshevist Russia]]n 11th [[Red Army]] invaded <ref>{{cite book|title=Socialism in Georgian Colors|first=Stephen F. |last=Jones|location=London |year=2005}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Marshall|authorlink=David Marshall Lang|year=1962|title=History of Modern Georgia}}</ref> Tbilisi after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city and declared Soviet rule.

===Under the Communist Government===
In 1921, the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] was [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|occupied]] by the [[Soviet]] [[Bolshevik]] forces from [[Russia]], and until 1991 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] (which included [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), and later as the capital of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. During the [[Soviet]] rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more [[industrialized]] and came to be an important political, social, and cultural center of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned [[Tbilisi Rock Festival (1980)|rock festival]] in the USSR.

Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the [[March 9 Massacre in Tbilisi, 1956|March 9 Massacre]], in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of [[Khrushchev]].  [[1978 Georgian demonstrations|Peaceful protests]] occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the [[April 9 tragedy]] was a peaceful protest that turned violent.

===After the break-up of the Soviet Union===
Since the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|break-up of the Soviet Union]], Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief Civil War which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-[[Zviad Gamsakhurdia|Gamsakhurdia]] and Opposition forces clashed with each other), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations between various [[Russian mafia|mafia]] clans and illegal business entrepreneurs. Even during the [[Shevardnadze]] Era (1993-2003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling [[economics|economy]]. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified [[parliamentary election]]s forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the [[Rose Revolution]]. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with  decreasing crime rates and improving economy. {{Fact|date=February 2009}}

The Tbilisi area received multiple [[Russia]]n air attacks during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].

==Politics and Administration==
The status of Tbilisi, as the nation<U+2019>s capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]] (1995) and the ''Law on Georgia<U+2019>s Capital <U+2013> Tbilisi'' ([[February 20]], [[1998]]).<ref>{{ge icon}} [http://www.parliament.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&sec_id=69&kan_det=det&kan_id=140 <U+10E1><U+10D0><U+10E5><U+10D0><U+10E0><U+10D7><U+10D5><U+10D4><U+10DA><U+10DD><U+10E1> <U+10D3><U+10D4><U+10D3><U+10D0><U+10E5><U+10D0><U+10DA><U+10D0><U+10E5><U+10D8><U+10E1> - <U+10D7><U+10D1><U+10D8><U+10DA><U+10D8><U+10E1><U+10D8><U+10E1> <U+10E8><U+10D4><U+10E1><U+10D0><U+10EE><U+10D4><U+10D1>]. The [[Parliament of Georgia]]. Retrieved on [[May 22]], [[2007]].</ref>

Tbilisi is governed by the [[Tbilisi Assembly]] (Sakrebulo) and the [[Tbilisi City Hall]] (Meria). The City Assembly gets elected once every four years. The mayor gets elected by the City Assembly. The current [[Mayor of Tbilisi]] is [[Giorgi (Gigi) Ugulava]] and the Chairman of the Tbilisi City Assembly is Zaal Begashvili.

Administratively, the city is divided into [[raion]]s ([[district]]s), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general [[subdivision of the Soviet Union]]. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:
* [[Old Tbilisi|Dzveli Tbilisi]] (<U+10EB><U+10D5><U+10D4><U+10DA><U+10D8> <U+10D7><U+10D1><U+10D8><U+10DA><U+10D8><U+10E1><U+10D8>)
* [[Vake-Saburtalo District|Vake-Saburtalo]] (<U+10D5><U+10D0><U+10D9><U+10D4>-<U+10E1><U+10D0><U+10D1><U+10E3><U+10E0><U+10D7><U+10D0><U+10DA><U+10DD>)
* [[Didube-Chugureti District|Didube-Chugureti]] (<U+10D3><U+10D8><U+10D3><U+10E3><U+10D1><U+10D4>-<U+10E9><U+10E3><U+10E6><U+10E3><U+10E0><U+10D4><U+10D7><U+10D8>)
* [[Gldani-Nadzaladevi District|Gldani-Nadzaladevi]] (<U+10D2><U+10DA><U+10D3><U+10D0><U+10DC><U+10D8>-<U+10DC><U+10D0><U+10EB><U+10D0><U+10DA><U+10D0><U+10D3><U+10D4><U+10D5><U+10D8>)
* [[Isani-Samgori District|Isani-Samgori]] (<U+10D8><U+10E1><U+10D0><U+10DC><U+10D8>-<U+10E1><U+10D0><U+10DB><U+10D2><U+10DD><U+10E0><U+10D8>)
* [[Didgori District|Didgori]] (<U+10D3><U+10D8><U+10D3><U+10D2><U+10DD><U+10E0><U+10D8> )

Most of the raions are named after respective historical neighborhoods of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognize a system of the smaller non-formal historical neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighborhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.

In pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:<blockquote>In the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur&aacute; and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from Wurtemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab&aacute;r). On the right bank of the Kur&aacute; is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.<ref>Karl Baedeker, ''Russia: A Handbook for Travelers'' (Arno Press, 1971, reprint of 1914 ed.), p. 467.</ref></blockquote>Avlabar is considered "the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'" and is currently the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.<ref>[http://www.archistyle.ge/ JSC IBERIA Realty] Architectural Competition.</ref>

==Geography==
===Location===
[[Image:Kazbek Tbilisi Clouds.jpg|thumb|280px|View towards Northern Tbilisi, with Mt. Kazbek rising above the clouds in the distant background]]
Tbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41<U+00B0> 43' North Latitude and 44<U+00B0> 47' East Longitude. The city is situated in [[East Georgia]] on both banks of the [[Kura|Mt'k'vari River]]. The elevation of the city ranges from 380-770 meters above sea level (1246-1968 ft) and possesses the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the [[Saguramo Range]], to the east and south-east by the [[Iori Plain]], to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the [[Trialeti Range]].

The relief of Tbilisi is quite complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari ([[Kura River|Kura]]) River extends for more than 30&nbsp;km (19 miles) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. [[Image:Coordinates Tbilisi.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Tbilisi Coordinates]]The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River on the other hand is built along the foothills of the [[Trialeti Range]], the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.

North of the city is a large reservoir (commonly known as the ''Tbilisi Sea'') fed by irrigation canals.

===Climate===
[[Image:KusTba 008.jpg|thumb|275px|right|[[Turtle Lake, Tbilisi|Turtle Lake (Kus Tba)]] in January]]
The climate of Tbilisi is transitional from humid subtropical to relatively mild continental. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and humid subtropical (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Tbilisi experiences relatively cold winters and hot summers. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from [[Russia]], Tbilisi has a relatively mild micro-climate compared to other cities that possess a similar continental climate along the same latitudes.

The average annual temperature in Tbilisi is {{convert|12.7|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}. January is the coldest month with an average temperature of {{convert|0.9|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}. July is the hottest month with an average temperature of {{convert|24.4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}. The absolute minimum recorded temperature is {{convert|-23|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} and the absolute maximum is {{convert|40|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}. Average annual precipitation is 568&nbsp;mm (22.4 inches). May is the wettest month (90&nbsp;mm) while January is the driest (20&nbsp;mm). Snow may fall on average for 15-25 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.

==People and culture==
===Demographics===
[[Image:Georgian Carpets Gallery.gif|thumb|250px|right|Carpet gallery.]]
Tbilisi is a [[multicultural]] city. The city is home to more than 100 different [[ethnic]] groups. Around 80% of the population is ethnically Georgian, with significant populations of other ethnic groups which include [[Russians]], [[Armenians]], and [[Azeris]]. Along with the above mentioned groups, Tbilisi is also home to various other ethnic groups including [[Ossetians]], [[Abkhazians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Estonians]], [[Germans]], [[Kurds]], [[Assyrians]], and others. [[Image:<U+10D7><U+10D1><U+10D8><U+10DA><U+10D8><U+10E1><U+10D8> 15 Tbilisi.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sameba Cathedral.]]

===Religion===
More than 85% of the residents of Tbilisi practice various forms of [[Christianity]] (the most predominant of which is the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]). The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] as well as the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] have significant following within the city as well. [[Catholics]], [[Lutherans]], [[Baptists]], and other [[Christian]] denominations also make up the city's [[Christian]] minority. A large minority of the population (around 8%) practises [[Islam]] (mainly [[Sunni]] [[Islam]]). [[Judaism]] is also common, but to a lesser extent (about 2% of Tbilisi's population practices [[Judaism]]). Tbilisi has been historically known for [[religious tolerance]]. This is especially evident in the city's Old Town, where a [[Mosque]], [[Synagogue]], and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches]] can all be found within less than {{convert|500|m|ft|spell=us}} from each other.

===Sports===
[[Image:LocomotiveStadium.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tbilisi's Locomotive Stadium.]]
[[Image:National Inside.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Boris Paichadze National Stadium. Inside view, after reconstruction.]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Leila Meskhi Tenniss Stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|Tennis Stadium.]] -->

Tbilisi has a fairly rich sports history. Like many other towns of the [[Near East]] with strong Asian cultural influences, Tbilisi historically had a special area of town that was designated for sports competitions. The present-day districts of [[Saburtalo]] and [[Didube]] were the most common areas where such competitions were held. Up until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding ([[polo]] in particular), [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[marksmanship]] were the most popular city sports. As Tbilisi started to develop socially and economically and integrate more with the West, new sports from Europe were introduced. The [[Soviet]] period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in [[Europe]] and to a certain extent, the [[United States]]. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for various professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 [[basketball]] courts and halls, 192 [[volleyball]] facilities, 82 [[team handball|handball]] arenas, 19 [[tennis]] courts, 31 [[football (soccer)]] fields, and five stadiums. At present, the largest stadium in Tbilisi is the [[Boris Paichadze Stadium]] (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the [[Mikheil Meskhi Stadium]] (24,680 seats). The [[Sports Palace (Tbilisi)|Sports Palace]] which usually hosts [[basketball]] games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat up to approximately 11,000 people.
[[Vere Basketball Hall]] is a smaller [[Indoor arena|indoor sports arena]] with a 2,5000 [[seating capacity]].

The most popular sports in Tbilisi today are [[football (soccer)|football]], [[rugby union]], [[basketball]], and [[wrestling]]. Also popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players [[Zaza Pachulia]] and [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]] are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of inter-collegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.

Tbilisi's signature football team, [[Dinamo Tbilisi]], has not won a major European championship since 1981, when it won the European [[Cup Winners' Cup]] and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the [[Euroleague]] in [[FIBA European Champions Cup 1961-62|1962]] but also never repeated any such feat.

===Media===
The large majority of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia<U+2019>s]] media companies (including television, newspaper and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular [[Rustavi 2]] television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the [[Rose Revolution]]. In addition to ''Rustavi 2'', the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including [[Imedi Media Holding|Imedi TV]] ''Mze'' and the ''Public Broadcasting Channel'') are based in the city as well. Tbilisi<U+2019>s television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when ''Rustavi 2'' successfully bought out the ''Mze TV'' Company and [[Rupert Murdoch|Rupert Murdoch<U+2019>s]] [[News Corporation]] became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006. By taking over the Imedi Media Holding Group, News Corporation entered the [[Post-Soviet]] media market for the first time in the company's history.

Tbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily ''24 Saati'' ("24 Hours"), ''Rezonansi'' ("Resonance"), ''Alia'', the English-language daily ''The Messenger'', weekly ''FINANCIAL, Georgia Today'', and the English-language weekly ''The Georgian Times''. Out of the city<U+2019>s radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9[[FM]]), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the more influential competitors with large national audiences.

===Architecture===
The architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian), with strong influences of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Europe]]an/[[Russia]]n (neo-classical), and [[Middle Eastern]] [[architectural]] styles. The oldest parts of town, including the Abanot-Ubani, Avlabari, and to a certain extent the Sololaki districts clearly have a traditional Georgian architectural look with [[Middle Eastern]] influences. The areas of Tbilisi which were built up mainly in the 19th century (Rustaveli Avenue, Vera district, etc.) have a contrasting [[Europe]]an/[[Russia]]n ([[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]]) look.
The turn of the 20th century was marked with an architectural revival, notably, with an [[art nouveau]] style. With the establishment of the communist government the style was decreed as bourgeois and largely neglected. Architecture of the later 20th century can mainly be identified with the type of building style that was common during the [[Soviet]] Era throughout the [[Soviet Union]]. 
[[Image:Tbilisi Fountain.jpg|thumb|250px|Fountain in Tbilisi.|right]]

This included building large, concrete apartment blocks as well as social, cultural, and office facilities which did not particularly fit Tbilisi's landscape. Since the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]], Tbilisi has been the site of uncontrolled/unsanctioned building projects. Since 2004, the city government has taken new initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. In the near future, Tbilisi will have two [[skyscraper]] complexes. The [[Axis Towers]] and the new [[Ajaria Hotel/Business Complex]] (under construction) will be the tallest buildings/[[skyscrapers]] in the [[Caucasus]].

===Main sights===
Tbilisi has a number of important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The [[parliament]] and the [[government]] ([[State Chancellery]]) buildings of Georgia, as well as the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (country)|Supreme Court of Georgia]], are all located in Tbilisi. The city also has important [[cultural]] landmarks such as the [[Tbilisi State Conservatoire]], [[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre]], [[Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre]], [[Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre]], the [[Sameba Cathedral]], the [[Vorontsov]]'s Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), many state museums, the [[National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia]], the [[National Bank of Georgia]] and other important institutions. During the [[Soviet]] times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top 4 cities in the [[Soviet Union]] for the number of museums.

Out of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable locations are the [[Narikala fortress]] (4th century-17th century AD), [[Anchiskhati Church]] (6th century, built up in the 16th century), [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral|Sioni Cathedral]] (8th century, later rebuilt), [[Church of Metekhi]] (13th century), etc.

==Miscellaneous==
===Pronunciation===
Georgians pronounce Tbilisi with a barely-spoken 't', so that it almost sounds like {{IPA|/b<U+026A><U+02C8>lisi/}}, or "bill-EE-see"; English speakers often mispronounce it like {{IPA|/t<U+026A>b<U+02C8>lisi/}}, or "tib-LEE-see". The correct pronunciation is {{IPA|/<U+02CC>tbi<U+02C8>li<U+02D0>si/}}, or "tbee-LEE-see", with no vowel between the T and B, but both pronounced nonetheless.

==Education==
Universities in Tbilisi include:
* [[Georgian Institute of Public Affairs]]
* [[Tbilisi State University]]
* [[Georgian Technical University]]
* [[TULC|Ilia Chavchavadze State University]]
* [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]]
* [[Tbilisi State Medical University]]
