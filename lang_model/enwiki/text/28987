'''Ren<U+00E9> Fran<U+00E7>ois Lecomte''', born 14 May 1764 in [[Fontenay-le-Comte]] ([[Vend<U+00E9>e]]), died on 15 October 1793 in [[Bressuire]] ([[Deux-S<U+00E8>vres]]), was a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and, in particular, the [[War in the Vend<U+00E9>e]].

==Military service==
Lecomte entered military service in 1779 as an apprentice on board the "Saint-Michel"; he became a [[helmsman]] the following year, and participated in [[Pierre Andr<U+00E9> de Suffren]]'s expedition against the British in India.  In 1780, he was a soldier of the Regiment Austrasie and was appointed sergeant major of that regiment in that year.  In 1782, he among the first to enter the British entrenchments off the Island Gandelour defended by the English.<ref name=Davis>{{fr icon}}Shenandoah Davis [http://shenandoahdavis.canalblog.com/archives/2013/12/11/28641731.html ''Archives historiques de la ville de Fontenay-le-Comte''].

Back in France, he was discharged in 1785 , and became manager of Maynard goods, Baron de Langon.  In 1790 , he filled the office of head of the local administration of the Vend<U+00E9>e, and he enlisted on 19 September 1791.  The following month, he was elected lieutenant of the 3rd battalion of volunteers of Deux-S<U+00E8>vres.<ref name=Davis/>

In September 1792 , he took temporarily command the battalion and November, he received the rank of battalion chief.  He acquired his company and a legendary reputation for bravery.  On 28 June 1793 he participated in the victory at the [[Battle of Lu<U+00E7>on]] and was rewarded with patent brigade adjutant general in July 1793.<ref name=Davis/>

The 24th of the same month, he participated in the [[Battle of Pont-Charron]], and was promoted to brigadier general on 30 July 1793 .  Augustin Tuncq, his divisional general, gave him overall, but temporary, command of the division so he could receive treatment for injuries at [[La Rochelle]], but on 5 September, the division was crushed by Gigot d<U+2019>Elb<U+00E9>e's 20,000 men  at the [[Battle of Chantonnay]]. Lecomte had not taken any precautions in building the defenses and left without issuing appropriate orders.<ref name=Samariens>Samariens sous l' Empire, [http://remy-godbert80.eklablog.com/general-tuncq-augustin-a106272908 ''Augustin tuncq''], 3 February2014 version.

After the debacle at Chantonnay, Tuncq was removed from his command, probably due to a long-standing dispute with the commanding officer [[Jean Antoine Rossignol]]<ref name=Samariens/>  and Lecomte confirmed in his command. Barely recovered, he resumed his place in the army, and was proposed for the rank of major general on 8 October 1793 by the local representatives on mission.<ref name=Davis/>

On October 11, at the [[Battle of Ch<U+00E2>tillon (1793)]] he was again wounded.  Carried by soldiers to [[Bressuire]], he died 15 October 1793 , as a result of his injury.<ref name=Davis/>
