'''Tsing Yi''' ({{zh-c|c=<U+9752><U+8863>}}), or '''Tsing Yi Island''' ({{zh-t|t=<U+9752><U+8863><U+5CF6>}}) is an [[island]] of [[Hong Kong]], to the northwest of [[Hong Kong Island]]. Area: 10.67 km<U+00B2>.
The island has extended drastically by reclamation of almost all its natural shore and annexation of [[Nga Ying Chau]] and [[Chau Tsai]].  Three major bays or harbours, [[Tsing Yi Tong]] , [[Mun Tsai Tong]] and [[Tsing Yi Bay]] in the northeast, have been completely reclaimed for [[new town]]s.

The Island can be considered as four quarters [[quarter]]s, the northeast quarter is a residential area, the southeast quarter is a container port, the southwest holds heavy industry, and the northwest includes a recreation trail, a transportation interchange and some ship yards. The island is at the northwest part of [[Victoria Harbour]] and part of its  development is under the law, Chapter 531, the [[Protection of the Harbour Ordinance]].

==Name==
[[Image:Tsing_Yi_Island_in_Yuet_Tai_Kei.png|thumb|300px|right|The position of Tsing Yi Island, as Chun Fa Lok (<U+6625><U+82B1><U+843D>), in the map of Yuet Tai Kei (<U+7CB5><U+5927><U+8A18>) written by Kwok Fei (<U+90ED><U+68D0>) during Ming Dynasty. (Note: The south is on the top of the map.)]]

Tsing Yi (<U+9752><U+8863>) means green (or black) clothes.  It is also a kind of fish, probably [[Green Wrasse]], once abundant in nearby waters.  People named the island after the fish. [[Tsing Yi Tam]] (<U+9752><U+8863><U+6F6D>, ''lit.'' Tsing Yi Pool) or [[Tsing Yi Tam Shan]] (<U+9752><U+8863><U+6F6D><U+5C71>, ''lit.'' Tsing Yi Pool Hill) also appeared on some early Chinese maps.

The Island was also known as Chun Fa Lok (<U+6625><U+82B1><U+843D>) once upon a time, which means "the fall of spring flowers", or [[Chun Fa Island]], on some Western maps.  Now, '''Chun Fa Lok''' is still a place name on the southeast corner of the island.  A government document in [[Ming Dynasty]] named the water near Chun Fa Lok [[Chun Fa Yeung]] (<U+6625><U+82B1><U+6D0B>), probably now the [[Rambler Channel]].  The Ming navy defeated fleets of pirates there.

In some historical sources, '''Tsing-I Island''' is used instead of ''Tsing Yi Island'', and '''Chung-Hue Island''' instead of ''Chun Fa Island''.

==Administration==
Tsing Yi, together with [[Kwai Chung]], is part of [[Tsuen Wan New Town]] of the [[Kwai Tsing District]] in the [[New Territories]]. Though Tsing Yi is a ''de facto'' outlying island, it is not accordingly included in the [[Islands District, Hong Kong|Islands District]].

Historically, Tsing Yi Island, with Kwai Chung, were usually in the same administration unit of [[Tsuen Wan]] because of their proximity and closely-knitted neighbourhood. Unlike Kwai Chung, however, whose [[village]]s are part of [[Tsuen Wan Rural Committee]], Tsing Yi Island has its own, [[Tsing Yi Rural Committee]]. The [[rural committee]] was politically significant until the establishment of a [[District Council]] and [[Regional Council, Hong Kong|Regional Council]] (now-abolished), and even less significant since the urban population grew much larger than the rural population.

==Population==
There were about 4000 people on the island when the British took the New Territories around 1898.  From the 2001 [[Census]], there were 193432 people, i.e. 55478 [[household]]s, on the island.  In the past hundred years, the [[population]] has grown to nearly 50 times the size.  It is expected to grow to 203300 in the future.

==Geography==
Tsing Yi Island is a hilly island with [[Tsing Yi Peak]] in the south and [[Liu To Shan]] in the north east.  Small plain can be found surrounding the former [[Tsing Yi Lagoon]] in island northeast.  The rocks on the island are mainly [[granite]] and were exposed due to extensive housing, industrial and infrastructure construction.  Although the island is not fallen in the administration of [[country park]], most of the hilly area remains green.  The Tsing Yi Peak climbs to 334 metres and is a barrier separating industrial west and residential east.

==Nature==
The hilly area of the island largely remains intact and is designated as a [[green belt]].  In [[1997]] a once lost endemic plant, [[Hong Kong croton]], was found in the woodland beneath the highest peak, [[Tsing Yi Peak]], on the island.

==History==
[[Image:Tsing Yi Promenade.jpg|300px|thumb|right|float|Tsing Yi Promenade along Rambler Channel]]
In the early days, the inhabitants on the island were mostly farmers and fishermen. The major population concentrated in the northeast portion of the island. Farmers grew [[rice]], vegetables and [[pineapple]]s, while fishermen lived in huts connected by plank walkways in the small harbour of [[Tsing Yi Tong]] which stretched far back into the island. Many fishermen also lived on their [[Junk (ship)|junk]]s and boats all the time, fishing in the nearby waters.  Even as late as the 1970s, Tsing Yi Tong resembled [[Tai O]] with its characteristical [[pang uk|stilt houses]] and water vehicles. Like many other fishing villages in Hong Kong, the Tsing Yi dwellers worshipped [[Matsu (goddess)|Tin Hau]], the goddess of mercy and the sea. A [[Tin Hau Temple]] was built on the shore of Tsing Yi Tong. At the birthday of Tin Hau, fishermen of all nearby waters would come to the Temple for celebrations.  The temple was white in color and thus people call it ''Pak Miu'' (<U+767D><U+5EDF>, ''lit.'' White Temple).

From the 1920s onwards, a [[mainland China|mainland]] company built [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] factories on the present site of [[Greenfield Garden]]. It is the earliest known industry on the island.  The lime industry continued to flourish during the 1950s, and a tanning factory was also founded at the same period.  After [[World War II]], other heavy industries moved in as well. In the 1960s, several oil companies moved their oil storage depots onto the island, likewise a [[China Light and Power]] [[power station]], and a [[Green Island Cement]] cement plant.  Meanwhile, some small [[shipbuilding]] companies started their business in Tsing Yi, and remain on the north side of the Island.  In the 1970s, six large-scale companies on the island collectively built the [[Tsing Yi Bridge]] to connect Tsing Yi and [[Kwai Chung]] over the [[Rambler Channel]]. The bridge was soon transferred to the Hong Kong Government, remaining the sole road connection to the island for more than ten years. Several industrial buildings for light industries  were constructed beside the bridge afterward. Several dockyards moved to the west shore of the island at the end of the 1970s.

It is noteworthy that [[Wok Tai Wan]] on the Tsing Yi Island was once a paradise for [[nudist]]s during the 1950s, and hence  Tsing Yi was once [[synonymous]] with nudism in Hong Kong.

After the establishment of the Tsing Yi Bridge, the Hong Kong Government commenced an extensive [[new town]] project on the Island. [[Cheung Ching Estate]], [[Cheung Hong Estate]] and [[Mayfair Gardens]] were consequently built in heaps. The vicinity of the [[Mobil]]  oil storage depot to Mayfair Garden and Cheung Ching Estate once aroused enormous concern for the safety of the residents. Some social workers and residents urged the government to relocate the storage facilities.  The government decided to halt the last phase of the Mayfair Garden development scheme. The storage facility remained at the same location until [[Container Terminal 9]] was on the Government's agenda.

Later on, the tenor of town development shifted northward. Two fisherman harbours, Tsing Yi Tong and [[Mun Tsai Tong]] were [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] for residenital use. Many fishermen were relocated from their boats parked in the typhoon shelter to the Ching Tao House, a new residential block on land, of Chueng Ching Estate. The land inhabitants were put together into several designated areas so as to re-build their villages. The primary sectors had all died out owing to the drastic town development. [[Tsing Yi Estate]], [[Cheung On Estate]], [[Cheung Fat Estate]], Ching Tai Court and Tsing Yi Garden  were built after all reclamations were accomplished. [[Ching Wah Court]] was built adjoining to Cheung Hong Estate.

At the same time, Tsing Yi Bridge was seriously overburdened and its structure was unable to cope with ever-increasing traffic. There was only a one-way road in each direction on the bridge. [[Traffic congestion]] became the burning problem in the community, and subsequently aroused protest. Finally, [[Tsing Yi North Bridge]], a connection to [[Tsuen Wan]] was built to ease off the congestion, as well as to accommodate the local residential population boom.

[[Image:Northern part of new town on Tsing Yi Island.jpg|thumb|right|float|300px|Clusters of highrise residential blocks in the island northeast]]
Tsing Yi was continually under further development and [[Greenfield Garden]], [[Serene Garden]], [[Broadview Garden]], and [[Cheung Hang Estate]] were constructed.

The final decision to relocate [[Hong Kong International Airport]] spurred a new series of development: [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Railway]], [[Ting Kau Bridge]] to [[Ting Kau]] and North [[New Territories]], [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] to [[Ma Wan]] and [[Lantau Island]], [[Rambler Channel Bridge]] to [[Kowloon]] and [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Duplicate Tsing Yi South Bridge]] on the south side of Tsing Yi Bridge.

On the island, new residential projects, [[Tivoli Garden]], Grand Horizon, Mount Haven, [[Villa Esplanada]], [[Tierra Verde]], and [[Cheung Wang Estate]] were completed.  The final part of reclaimed land near the shore had been laid waste for almost a decade until [[Tsing Yi Promenade]] was built in 2004.  Local Hong Kong cultural pursuits of Chinese music and dancing, walking and Chinese exercise are in evidence in most evenings.

During 2000 to 2004 Container Terminal 9 was built on the reclaimed southwest shore of the island, together with  resident blocks, [[Rambler Crest]].  Nearby, and well within sight of Hong Kong Central, a controversial new dioxin burning plant was also put into operation during 2004, arousing much concern for the residents of Tsing Yi and Hong Kong island.

===Pier===
Before the completion of Tsing Yi Bridge, [[ferry]] was the only [[public transport]] to the mainland. [[Tsing Yi Pier]] was built near [[Tsing Yi Town]] before the reclamation.  The pier followed the change of shoreline owing after reclamation, and moved to the [[waterfront]] near [[Greenfield Garden]].

Hovercraft service between Tsuen Wan, Tsing Yi and Central was provided by the former [[Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry]]. After the franchise of the company came to an end, [[Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry]] took over the route and operated it.

All ferry services ceased with rapid development of road and rail transport, especially [[MTR]] [[Tung Chung Line]] with its station just a few hundred metres away from the ferry pier.  It no longer takes residents to [[Tsuen Wan]] and [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].  The pier is now open to the public, and continues to be used as a drop-off point for fishermen and tourists, and as a mooring site for Government boats.

==Religious buildings==
* [[Tin Hau Temple]]; the temple was originally located near Tsing Yi Tong.  Upon reclamation of Tsing Yi, it was moved to [[Ha Ko Tan]] (<U+4E0B><U+9AD8><U+7058>), near today's [[Chung Mei Lo Uk Village]].
* [[Chun Kwan Temple]]; the temple was relocated near [[Tsing Yi Police Station]].
* [[Tsing Tak Tong Tat-more Temple]]; the [[Bodhidharma]] temple in [[Tsing Yi Lutheran Village]].
* [[St. Thomas the Apostle Church]]; the [[Catholic church]] building, near [[Tsing Yi Estate]] and [[Tsing Yi Park]], was completed in July [[1999]].
* [[Tsing Yi Ward]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]; The church is near [[Maritime Square]] and [[St. Pauls Village]].
* [[Tai Yam Neong Neong Temple]] (<U+592A><U+9670><U+5A18><U+5A18><U+5EDF>); [[Taoist]] temple, worshipping the [[Goddess]] of [[Moon]], [[Chang'e (mythology)|Sheung Ngo]] (<U+5AE6><U+5A25>), located in Tsing Yi Lutheran Village.
* [[Tai Wong Temple]] (<U+5927><U+738B><U+53E4><U+5EDF>), [[Taoist]] temple in Tsing Yi Lutheran Village.
* [[Tsing Lam Church]] (<U+9752><U+9716><U+5802>), [[Protestant]] church by the side of [[Fishermen's Village]] and [[St. Paul's Village]]; the buildings were formally "[[Fish Marketing Organisation]] [[Tsing Yi Fishermen's Children's Primary School]]".

==Education==
In the early days, education on the Tsing Yi Island was largely private.  The first public school on the island is [[Tsing Yi Public School]], a primary school founded by villages and the market on the island.  In post-World War II era, [[Hong Kong Government]] provides 9-year free education to all children from primary 1 to secondary 3.  The public school is then mainly funded by the Government.  Another school for the children of fishermen, Tsing Yi Fishermen's Children's Primary School, was founded by [[Fish Marketing Organisation]].  In 1977, Cheung Ching Estate, the first public housing estates on the island, marked the beginning of the new town on the island.  To accommodate new schooling children, three primary schools and Buddhist Yip Kei Nam Memorial College, the first secondary school on the island, were built with the estate.   More schools were erected when new estates were completed. In [[1999]], a post-secondary college, [[Hong Kong Technical College (Tsing Yi)]], was completed and provides vocational training for all adults in Hong Kong.  In 2000s, the number of schooling children began to drop and the several schools are facing the fatal fate.

Numerous schools are founded on Tsing Yi Island, namely:
