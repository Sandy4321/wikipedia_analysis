The modern '''Olympic Games''' ({{lang-fr|{{noitalic|les}} Jeux olympiques}}, ''JO''<ref>"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.", [http://www.olympic.org/fr/]."(..)</ref>) is the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes participate in a [[multi-sport event|variety of competitions]]. The Olympic Games are considered to be the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.<ref name="EB" /> The Olympic Games are held quadrennially, (every four years) with the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Games]] alternating, meaning they each occur every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the [[ancient Olympic Games]], which were held in [[Olympia, Greece]], from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] founded the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the [[Olympic Movement]], with the [[Olympic Charter]] defining its structure and authority.

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Games for ice and winter sports, the [[Paralympic Games]] for athletes with a disability, and the [[Youth Olympic Games]] for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allow participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the [[Cold War]] limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.

The Olympic Movement consists of [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs), [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each celebration of the Games. The host city is responsible for organizing and funding the Games consistent with the Olympic Charter. The Olympic program, consisting of the [[Olympic sports|sports]] to be contested at the Games, is also determined by the IOC. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the [[Olympic symbols#Flag|Olympic flag]] and [[Olympic Flame#Torches|torch]], as well as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening and closing ceremonies]]. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third place finishers in each event receive [[Olympic medal]]s: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.

The Games have grown in scale to the point that nearly every nation is represented. Such growth has created numerous challenges, including [[Olympic Games scandals and controversies|boycotts]], [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games|doping]], [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery]], and [[Munich massacre|acts of terrorism]]. Every two years, the Olympics and its media exposure, provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national, and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

{{main|Ancient Olympic Games}}
[[File:Olympia-stadion.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium in [[Olympia, Greece]].]]

The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece]]. Competition was among representatives of several [[city-state]]s and kingdoms of [[Ancient Greece]]. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.{{r|Swaddling 2000 p54}} This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Truce <U+2013> Myth and Reality by Harvey Abrams|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/abrams1.html|publisher=Classics Technology Center, AbleMedia.com|accessdate=12February 2013}}</ref> The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;{{sfn|Young|2004|p=12}} one of the most popular myths identifies [[Heracles]] and his father [[Zeus]] as the progenitors of the Games.<ref name="elis1-7-9" />{{sfn|Richardson|1992|p=227}}{{sfn|Young|2004|pp=12<U+2013>13}} According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games "Olympic" and established the custom of holding them every four years.<ref name="elis1-7-7" /> The myth continues that after Heracles completed his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labors]], he built the [[Olympic Stadium]] as an honor to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a "[[stadion (unit of length)|stadion]]" ({{lang-el|<U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD>}}, [[Latin]]: ''stadium'', "stage"), which later became a [[Stadion (unit of length)|unit of distance]]. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776&nbsp;BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Games|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/59589/The-ancient-Olympic-Games|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|format=registration required|accessdate=29 April 2009}}</ref> The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, [[Discus throw|discus]] and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, [[pankration]], and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] events.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|pp=59<U+2013>61}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient Olympic Events|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/sports.html|publisher=Perseus Project of [[Tufts University]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}</ref> Tradition has it that [[Coroebus of Elis|Coroebus]], a cook from the city of [[Elis]], was the first Olympic champion.{{sfn|Golden|2009|p=24}}

The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|famous statue]] by [[Phidias]] stood in his temple at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) and [[Pelops]], divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King [[Oenomaus]] of [[Pisa, Greece|Pisatis]].{{sfn|Burkert|1983|p=95}} The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues.{{sfn|Swaddling|1999|pp=90<U+2013>93}} The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an [[Olympiad]], was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the [[Panhellenic Games]], which included the [[Pythian Games]], the [[Nemean Games]], and the [[Isthmian Games]].<ref>Olympic Museum, "The Olympic Games in Antiquity", p. 2</ref>

The Olympic Games reached their [[zenith]] in the 6th and 5th&nbsp;centuries&nbsp;BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393&nbsp;AD, when the emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.<ref>However, Theodosius' decree contains no specific reference to Olympia {{harv|Crowther|2007|p=54}}.</ref> Another date commonly cited is 426&nbsp;AD, when his successor, [[Theodosius II]], ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.{{sfn|Crowther|2007|p=54}}

== Modern Games ==

=== Forerunners ===
[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]]]]

Various uses of the term "Olympic" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the [[Cotswold Games]] or "Cotswold Olimpick Games", an annual meeting near [[Chipping Campden]], England, involving various sports. It was first organized by the lawyer [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]] between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The [[British Olympic Association]], in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as "the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings".<ref name=BOA>{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>

''L'Olympiade de la R<U+00E9>publique'', a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games.<ref name="frencholympics" /> The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the [[metric system]] into sport.<ref name="frencholympics" />

In 1850 an Olympian Class was started by Dr. [[William Penny Brookes]] at [[Much Wenlock]], in [[Shropshire]], England. In 1859, Dr. Brookes changed the name to the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Wenlock Olympian Games]]. This annual sports festival continues to this day.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=144}} The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Dr. Brookes on 15 November 1860.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=28}}

Between 1862 and 1867, [[Liverpool]] held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by [[John Hulley]] and [[Charles Melly]], these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=53<U+2013>54}}{{sfn|Weiler|2004}} The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.{{r|Girginov Parry 2005 p38}} In 1865 Hulley, Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the [[British Olympic Association]]. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the [[Olympic Charter|International Olympic Charter]].{{sfn|Young|1996|p=24}} In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized at London's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml |title= Much Wenlock & the Olympian Connection |publisher= Wenlock Olympian Society |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090123183803/http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate= 23 January 2009}}</ref>

=== Revival ===

[[File:Stamp of Greece. 1896 Olympic Games. 2l.jpg|thumb|upright|A postage stamp from the first Greek Olympic stamp set.]]

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor [[Panagiotis Soutsos]] in his poem "Dialogue of the Dead", published in 1833.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=1}} [[Evangelos Zappas]], a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}} Zappas sponsored the first [[Zappas Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1859, which was held in an [[Athens]] city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [[Panathenaic Stadium]] so that it could host all future Olympic Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=14}}

The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=2, 13<U+2013>23, 81}} Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=44}} In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] was inspired to found the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).<ref name="wenlock" /> Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.<ref name="wenlock" /> He presented these ideas during the first [[Olympic Congress]] of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the [[University of Paris]]. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games, to come under the auspices of the IOC, would take place in Athens in 1896.{{sfn|Coubertin|Philemon|Politis|Anninos|1897|p=8|loc=Part 2}} The IOC elected the Greek writer [[Demetrius Vikelas]] as its first president.{{sfn|Young|1996|pp=100<U+2013>105}}

=== 1896 Games ===

{{main|1896 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The opening ceremony in the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]].]]

The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/Athens-1896/ |title=Athens 1896 |publisher=The International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> Zappas and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]] had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=117}}<ref>Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa <U+2013> Athens 1893, by F. Martens</ref><ref>L'affaire Zappa <U+2013> Paris 1894, by G. Streit</ref> [[George Averoff]] contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=128}} The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=128}}

Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>

=== Changes and adaptations ===

{{main|Summer Olympic Games}}

After the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition in 1900]] and the [[World's fair]] at St. Louis in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] were side-shows. The Games at Paris did not have a stadium; but was notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the [[United States at the 1904 Summer Olympics|United States]]. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://proxy.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904 |title= St. Louis 1904 <U+2013> Overview |publisher= ESPN |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> The Games rebounded when the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third [[Olympiad]]) were held in Athens. These Games are not officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |title= 1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 28 May 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>

==== Winter Games ====

{{main|Winter Olympic Games}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05472, St. Moritz, Winterolympiade.jpg|upright=0.93|thumb|left|An [[ice hockey]] game during the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] at [[St. Moritz]].]]

The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Olympic Congress]], in [[Lausanne]], it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11&nbsp;days) was held in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France, in connection with the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] held three months later; this event became the first [[Winter Olympic Games]].<ref name="chamonix" /> Although the same country was originally intended to host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |title= Winter Olympics History |publisher= Utah Athletic Foundation |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> This tradition was upheld until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Games]] in [[Albertville]], France; after that, beginning with the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Games]], the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.

==== Paralympics ====

{{main|Paralympic Games}}

In 1948, [[Ludwig Guttmann|Sir Ludwig Guttmann]], determined to promote the rehabitation of soldiers after [[World War II]], organized a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]]. Guttmann's event, known then as the [[IWAS World Games|Stoke Mandeville Games]], became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]], in Rome, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the "Parallel Olympics", which became known as the [[1960 Summer Paralympics|first Paralympics]]. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year. Since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm |title= History of the Paralympics |publisher= [[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2 February 2009 | date=4 September 2008}}</ref> In 2001 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.<ref name="Parahist" /><ref>{{cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://oldwebsite.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Chairman of the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games|London organising committee]], [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]], said about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in London that,

==== Youth Games ====

{{main|Youth Olympic Games}}

In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]] in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.<ref name="Rogge introduces" /><ref>{{cite news |last= Rice |first= John |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-07-05-2774646336_x.htm |title=IOC approves Youth Olympics; first set for 2010 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= USA Today |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref> The [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|first Summer Youth Games]] were held in Singapore from 14<U+2013>26 August 2010, while the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|inaugural Winter Games]] were hosted in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, two years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Innsbruck is the host city for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games|publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|date=12 December 2008|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/61888/32574/1t8ch2t/innsbruck-is-the-host-city-for.html|accessdate=30 March 2009}}</ref> These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days.<ref name="CRIonYOG" /> The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games.<ref name="YOGisGo" /><ref name="No kidding" /> The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2007-07-05-olympic-notes_N.htm |title= IOC votes to start Youth Olympics in 2010 |first= Vicky |last= Michaelis |date= 5 July 2007 |work= USA Today |accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>

=== Recent games ===

From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="iocfactsheet" /> The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, [[Turin]] hosted 2,508 athletes from 80 nations competing in 84 events during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080822100911/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006 |archivedate= 22 August 2008 |title= Turin 2006 |publisher= International Olympic Committee |accessdate=26 August 2008}}</ref> During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the [[Olympic Village]]. This village is intended to be a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beijing to build convenient Olympic village|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref>

The IOC allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games. Examples of this include territories such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bermuda]], and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723070003/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2009|page=61|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> The current version of the Charter allows for the establishment of new National Olympic Committees to represent nation which qualify as "an independent State recognised by the international community".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Charter|url=http://www.asksam.com/ebooks/releases.asp?doc_handle=135969&file=Olympic-Charter.ask&query=recognised%20by%20the%20international%20community&search=yes|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> Therefore, it did not allow the formation of National Olympic Committees for [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] when they gained the same constitutional status as [[Aruba]] in 2010, although the IOC had recognized the [[Aruban Olympic Committee]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/executive-board-concludes-first-meeting-of-the-new-year/112731|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|title=Executive Board concludes first meeting of the new year|publisher=olympic.org ("Official website of the Olympic movement")}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/mr-jose-perurena?articleid=133159|title=Curtain comes down on 123rd IOC Session|work=Olympic.org|accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Economic and social impact on host cities and countries ===
Many economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such "mega-events" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.<ref>Rose, A. K., & Spiegel, M. M. (2011). The Olympic Effect*. ''The Economic Journal,'' 121(553), 652<U+2013>677.</ref> Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the [[Philanthropy#Modern_vernacular_uses_of_the_word|philanthropic contributions of corporations]] headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. <U+201C>Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities.<U+201D> ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 58(1): 111<U+2013>148.].</ref> The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.<ref>Glynn, M.

== International Olympic Committee ==

{{main|International Olympic Committee}}
[[File:Siege cio.jpg|thumb|The I.O.C. headquarters at [[Lausanne]].]]

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations, recognized media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.<ref name="movement" /> As the umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.<ref name="movement roles" />

The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:

* [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IFs) are the [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football ([[FIFA]]) is the IF for Association football (soccer), and the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Volleyball]] is the international governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.<ref>{{cite web |title=For the Good of the Athletes|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|date=31 October 2007|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/ioc/n214186786.shtml|accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref>
* [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country. For example, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) is the NOC of the United States. There are currently 205 NOCs recognized by the IOC.<ref name="iocfactsheet" />
* Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organization of each Olympic Games. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/ioc-governance-organising-committees|title=Organising Committees for the Olympic Games |publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>

French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=53|loc=Rule 24}}

=== Criticism ===

The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization, with several members on the committee for life. The presidential terms of [[Avery Brundage]] and [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement and the influence of advertising.{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=52<U+2013>60}} He was accused of both racism, for his handling of the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] issue with the [[South Africa at the Olympics|South African]] delegation, and [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=60<U+2013>69}} Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both [[nepotism]] and corruption.<ref>{{cite news |title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post|publisher=CBC Sports|date=18 May 2001|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html|accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> Samaranch's ties with the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] in Spain were also a source of criticism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympics:Barcelona Profile; Samaranch, Under the Gun Shoots Back|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=30 June 1992|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB173FF933A05755C0A964958260|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref>

In 1998, it was uncovered that several IOC members had [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|taken bribes]] from members of the [[Salt Lake City]] bid committee for the hosting of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge Drops Olympic Bid Case|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=6 December 2003|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/06/sports/sp-saltlakecity6|accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref>

A [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]: Buying the Games'', aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="Buying the Games" /> The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games,<ref>{{cite news|first=Lynn|last=Zinser|title=London Wins 2012 Olympics New York Lags|work=The New York Times|date=7 July 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/sports/othersports/07olympic.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> Parisian Mayor [[Bertrand Delano<U+00EB>]] specifically accused the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe) of breaking the bid rules.

The [[Turin]] [[Bids for the 2006 Winter Olympics|bid]] for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, [[Marc Hodler]], strongly connected with the rival bid of [[Sion, Switzerland]], alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.<ref>{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=National Public Radio|date=7 February 2006|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref>

In July 2012, [[The Anti-Defamation League|The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)]] called the continued refusal by the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment of silence at the opening ceremony for the eleven Israeli athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics, "a continuing stubborn insensitivity and callousness to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes."<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Committee's Refusal to Honor Munich 11 Mired in 'Stubborn Insensitivity and Callousness'|url=http://archive.adl.org/PresRele/TerrorismIntl_93/Olympic-Committee-Stubborn-Munich-11.htm|publisher=ADL|accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>

== Commercialization ==

{{main|Cost of the Olympic Games}}

The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]], in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Under the leadership of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.<ref name="television" />

=== Budget ===

During the first half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget.<ref name="television" />{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organizing committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2&nbsp;million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231}} When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}}

The [[1984 Summer Olympics]] became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organizing committee, led by [[Peter Ueberroth]], was able to generate a surplus of US$225&nbsp;million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The organizing committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209}} The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Program (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand.<ref name="television" /> Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50&nbsp;million for a four-year membership.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci}} Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the [[Olympic symbols#Olympic rings|interlocking rings]], in their publications and advertisements.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}}

=== Effect of television ===

[[File:Olympic Final 2000 (1936 cartoon).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A cartoon from the 1936 Berlin Olympics imagines the year 2000 when spectators will have been replaced by television and radio, their cheers coming from loudspeakers.]]

The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Berlin 1936|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1936|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822100804/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1936|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref> The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] were the first internationally televised Olympic Games,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cortina d'Ampezzo|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1956|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822213008/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1956|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref> and the [[1960 Winter Olympics|following Winter Games]] had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialized television broadcasting networks<U+2014>[[CBS]] paid US$394,000 for the American rights,{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) allocated US$660,000.<ref name="television" /> In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=192}} For example, CBS paid US$375&nbsp;million for the rights of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano Games]],{{sfn|Gershon|2000|p=17}} while [[NBC]] spent US$3.5&nbsp;billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.<ref name="television" />

Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of color television in 1968.<ref>Whannel, G. (1984) The television spectacular in A. Tomlinson & G. Whannel (Eds.), Five-ring circus (pp. 30<U+2013>43). London: Pluto Press</ref> Global audience estimates for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Games]] was 600&nbsp;million, whereas at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Games of 1984]], the audience numbers had increased to 900&nbsp;million; that number swelled to 3.5&nbsp;billion by the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2005|p=14}} However, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Games]] in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968.<ref>{{cite news|title=World Series TV ratings slump|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/sports/main244877.shtml|work=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=4 May 2009 | date=27 October 2000}}</ref> This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era.<ref>{{cite news|title=All fall down|last=Walters|first=Walters|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|date=2 October 2000|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429222810/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archivedate=29 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref> A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time.<ref name="ratings" /> With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=16<U+2013>18}} The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=17}} Finally, the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States.{{sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=230}} The result of these efforts was mixed: the ratings for the 2006 Winter Games, held in Torino, Italy, were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, staged in Beijing.<ref name="ratings" />{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=146}}

=== Controversy ===

The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialized sporting spectacle.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games.{{sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii}} Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.{{sfn|Slack|2004|p=194}} Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments.{{sfn|Slack|2004|pp=194<U+2013>195}} Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.<ref>[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2009/wp09-06bk.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ''The Olympic Effect'', March 2009]</ref> However, this research also finds that unsuccessful bids to host the Olympics have a similar positive impact on exports, perhaps indicating that the Olympic effect on trade is attributable to the signal a country sends when bidding to host the games, rather than the act of actually holding a mega-event.

== Symbols ==

{{main|Olympic symbols}}
[[File:Olympic-flag-Victoria.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic symbols#Flag|Olympic flag]].]]

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the [[Olympic symbols#Olympic rings|Olympic rings]], consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Oceania, Europe). The colored version of the rings<U+2014>blue, yellow, black, green, and red<U+2014>over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.<ref name="olympicsymbols" />

The [[Olympic symbols#Motto|Olympic motto]], ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'', a [[Latin]] expression meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger" was proposed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1894 and has been official since 1924.  The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Henri Didon]] OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.<ref>"Sport athl<U+00E9>tique", 14 mars 1891: "[...] dans une <U+00E9>loquente allocution il a souhait<U+00E9> que ce drapeau les conduise <U+2018>souvent <U+00E0> la victoire, <U+00E0> la lutte toujours<U+2019>. Il a dit qu<U+2019>il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d<U+2019><U+00EA>tre des sports athl<U+00E9>tiques: citius, altius, fortius, <U+2018>plus vite, plus haut, plus fort<U+2019>.", cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carri<U+00E8>re du p<U+00E8>re Didon, Dominicain. 1840 <U+2013> 1900'', Doctoral thesis, Universit<U+00E9> de Paris IV <U+2013> Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements p<U+00E9>dagogiques de la devise olympique <U+201E>citius, altius,
fortius<U+201C>''</ref>

Coubertin's Olympic ideals are expressed in the [[Olympic symbols#Motto|Olympic creed]]:

| The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.<ref name="olympicsymbols" />
}}

Months before each Games, the [[Olympic Flame]] is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony.<ref name="torch" /> Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the torch relay was introduced at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Games]], as part of the German government's attempt to promote its [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ideology.<ref name="olympicsymbols" />

The [[List of Olympic mascots|Olympic mascot]], an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. It has played an important part on the Games identity promotion since the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], when the Russian bear cub [[Misha]] reached international stardom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1279748/Londons-Olympic-2012-mascots-revealed-Wenlock-Mandeville-unveiled-faces-Games.html|title=London's Olympic 2012 mascots are revealed: Wenlock and Mandeville unveiled as the 'faces' of the Games|date=23 May 2010|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> The mascots of the Summer Olympics, in Beijing, were the [[Fuwa]], five creatures that represent the five [[feng shui]] elements important in Chinese culture.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Official Mascots of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games |url= http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214068254.shtml |publisher= The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad |accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref>

== Ceremonies ==

{{main|Olympic Games ceremony}}

=== Opening ===

[[File:2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony (15).jpg|thumb|A scene from the opening ceremony of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London]]

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred.<ref name="OCFactSheetS" /><ref name="OCFactSheetW" /> Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.<ref name="OCprotocol1" /> The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem.<ref name="OCFactSheetS" /><ref name="OCFactSheetW" /> The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture.<ref name="OCprotocol1" /> The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100&nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |title= Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 8 August 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2008}}</ref>

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], which was hosted in [[Athens|Athens, Greece]], the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier<U+2014>often a well-known and successful Olympic athlete from the host nation<U+2014>who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name="OCFactSheetS" /><ref name="OCFactSheetW" />

== Sports ==

{{main|Olympic sports}}

The [[Olympic sports|Olympic Games program]] consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and nearly 400 events. For example, [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]] is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wrestling|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/|accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref> The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports.<ref name="Sports" /> [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Athletics]], [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Fencing at the Summer Olympics|fencing]], and [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|artistic gymnastics]] are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program.

Current Olympic sports, like [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|badminton]], [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|basketball]], and [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|volleyball]], first appeared on the program as [[demonstration sport]]s, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp |title=Olympic Sports of the Past |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref>

Olympic sports are governed by [[List of international sport federations|international sports federations]] (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|pp=88<U+2013>90}} There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/index_uk.asp |title=International Sports Federations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref>{{sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=87}} During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429094118/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Factsheet: The sessions |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref> There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity, including chess and surfing.<ref name="recognizedsports" />

In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non-Olympic recognized sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] and [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Summer Olympic Games]].<ref name="newosports" />

The 114th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC Session]], in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> Three years later, at the [[117th IOC Session]], the first major program revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|baseball]] and [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|softball]] from the official program of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Games]]. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 program featured just 26 sports.<ref name="factsheetsports" /> The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.<ref name="newosports" />

=== Amateurism and professionalism ===

{{further|Amateur}}
[[File:Nagano 1998-Russia vs Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|Professional [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players were allowed to participate in [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey]] starting in 1998 (''1998 Gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic pictured'').]]

The [[ethos]] of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[public school (United Kingdom)|English public school]] greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120<U+2013>123}} The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]'', a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120<U+2013>123}} Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120<U+2013>123}}

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref> Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/garmisch-partenkirchen-1936-winter-olympics |accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref>

As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.{{sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120<U+2013>123}} The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses <U+2013> from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 September 2008}}</ref> Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs.<ref name="Amateurism" /> As of 2004, the only sports in which no professionals compete are [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]], although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers and wrestlers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees.

=== Boycotts ===

[[File:Olympic boycotts 1976 1980 1984.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing the countries that boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] (yellow), [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]] (blue) and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] (red) Summer Olympics.]]

Australia, France, Great Britain and Switzerland are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The [[Olympic Council of Ireland]] boycotted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Games]], because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the [[Irish Free State]] rather than representing the entire [[Ireland|island of Ireland]].{{r|Kr<U+00FC>ger Murray 2003 p230}} There were three boycotts of the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]]: Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] by the Soviet Union, but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the [[Suez Crisis]]; and China (the "People's Republic of China") boycotted the Games because Taiwan (the "Republic of China") was allowed to compete in the games.<ref name="Boycott 1" /> In [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their [[racial segregation|segregationist]] regimes. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because [[New Zealand national rugby union team|its national rugby union team]] had toured [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport.<ref name="CBC boycott" /> Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a Tanzania-led withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.<ref name="CBC boycott" /><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore109/ore109h.pdf |title=Africa and the XXIst Olympiad |journal=Olympic Review |issue=109<U+2013>110 |pages=584<U+2013>585 |year=1976 |month=November<U+2013>December |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2009}}</ref> Taiwan also decided to boycott these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted pressure on the Montreal organizing committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name.

In 1980 and 1984, the [[Cold War]] opponents boycotted each other's Games. Sixty-five nations refused to compete at the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics]] in 1980 because of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 81, the lowest number since 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/moscow-1980-summer-olympics |title=Moscow 1980|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> The Soviet Union and 14 of its [[Eastern Bloc]] partners (except [[Romania at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Romania]]) countered by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]] of 1984, contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes. Soviet officials defended their decision to withdraw from the Games by saying that "chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria are being whipped up in the United States".<ref>{{cite news |last=Burns |first=John F. |title=Protests are Issue: Russians Charge 'Gross Flouting' of the Ideals of the Competition |work=The New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |date=9 May 1984}}</ref> The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the [[Friendship Games]], in July and August.<ref name="1980 Boycott" /><ref name="1980 Boycott 2" />

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]], and in response to [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan disturbances]] and ongoing [[War in Darfur|conflict in Darfur]].

=== Politics ===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G00630, Sommerolympiade, Siegerehrung Weitsprung.jpg|thumb|Jesse Owens on the podium after winning the long jump at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].]]
[[File:Carlos-Smith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] giving the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the podium.]]

The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the [[Nazism|National Socialist Party]] as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]], though they used the Games to display [[Aryan]] superiority.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=107}} Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, which did much to support their allegations of [[Aryan]] supremacy, but notable victories by African American [[Jesse Owens]], who won four gold medals, and [[Hungary at the 1936 Summer Olympics|Hungarian]] Jew [[Ibolya Cs<U+00E1>k]], blunted the message.{{sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|pp=111<U+2013>112}} The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] did not participate until the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organized an international sports event called [[Spartakiad]]s. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organizations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the "bourgeois" Olympics with the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|Workers Olympics]].<ref name="GSE" />{{sfn|Roche|2000|p=106}} It was not until the [[Soviet Union at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Games]] that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf |title=The USSR and Olympism |journal=[[International Olympic Committee#Publications|Olympic Review]] |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |issue=84 |pages=530<U+2013>557 |year=1974 |month=October |format=PDF |accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref> Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], who finished first and third in the 200&nbsp;meters, performed the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] on the victory stand. The second place finisher, [[Peter Norman]] of Australia, wore an [[Olympic Project for human rights]] badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] told the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.<ref name="Black Salute" />

Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian [[Judo#Judoka (practitioner)|judoka]], [[Arash Miresmaeili]], did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iranian Judoka rewarded after snubbing Israeli |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |date=8 September 2004|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5942871/ |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref>

=== Use of performance enhancing drugs ===

{{main|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games}}
[[File:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]] running the [[marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].]]

In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve and increase their athletic abilities. In 1904, Thomas Hicks-a gold medalist for the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. The Danish cyclist,Knud Enemark Jensen fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines.<ref name="wadahistory" /> By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|work=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=27 August 2008}}</ref>

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.{{sfn|Porterfield|2008|p=15}} The most publicized doping-related disqualification was in 1988 the Canaian Olympics where the Canadian sprinter, Ben Johnson (who won the 100-metre dash) was positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was later stripped and awarded to the American runner-up Carl Lewis, who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, by forming the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified because of doping offenses. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=3 September 2008}}</ref> During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances. Several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games; only three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.<ref name="wadahistory" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Doping: 3667 athletes tested, IOC seeks action against Halkia's coach|date=19 August 2008|publisher=Express India Newspapers|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Doping-3667-athletes-tested-IOC-seeks-action-against-Halkias-coach/350677/|accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref>

=== Sex discrimination ===

{{main|Women at the Olympics}}
[[File:Charlotte Cooper.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charlotte Cooper (tennis)|Charlotte Cooper]] of the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]], first woman Olympic champion, in the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Games]].]]

Women were first allowed to compete at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris, but at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] thirty-five countries were still fielding all-male delegations.<ref name="nytimes.com" /> This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, [[Bahrain at the Olympics|Bahrain]] sent two women competitors for the first time: [[Fatema Hameed Gerashi]] and [[Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/09/23/anderson_arab_women/ "Arab women make breakthrough at Games"], CNN, 23 September 2000</ref> In 2004, [[Robina Muqimyar]] and [[Fariba Rezayee]] became the first women to compete for [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan at the Olympics]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3826673.stm "Afghan women's Olympic dream"], BBC, 22 June 2004</ref> In 2008, the [[United Arab Emirates at the Olympics|United Arab Emirates]] sent female athletes ([[Maitha bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maitha Al Maktoum]] competed in taekwondo, and [[Latifa Al Maktoum]] in equestrian) to the Olympic Games for the first time. Both athletes were from [[Al Maktoum|Dubai's ruling family]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Should Saudi Arabia be Banned from the Olympics? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-wallechinsky/should-saudi-arabia-be-ba_b_115736.html |publisher=''Huffington Post'' |date=29 July 2008 |first=David |last=Wallechinsky}}</ref>

By 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: [[Brunei at the Olympics|Brunei]], [[Saudi Arabia at the Olympics|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar at the Olympics|Qatar]]. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would "press" these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. [[Anita DeFrantz]], chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] announced that it "hoped to send up to four female athletes in [[Shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics|shooting]] and [[Fencing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|fencing]]" to the 2012 Summer Games in London.

In 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: "For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organizations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination. [...] While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion."<ref name="nytimes.com" /> In July 2010, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported: "Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012. [...] Should Saudi Arabia [...] send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games".<ref name="independent.co.uk" />

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] in [[London]], England, for the first time in Olympic history, every country competing included female athletes<ref>{{cite web|title=Saudis to send 2 women to London, make history|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one ([[Maziah Mahusin]], in the 400m hurdles).

The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no "Women's Eventing", or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the program in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8196879.stm "Women's boxing gains Olympic spot"], British Broadcasting Corporation, 13 August 2009</ref> There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete: [[synchronized swimming]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]].

=== Terrorism and Violence ===

Three [[Olympiad]]s had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916 Games]] were cancelled because of [[World War I]], and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The [[2008 South Ossetia war|South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]] erupted on the opening day of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. Both [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Vladimir Putin|Prime Minister Putin]] were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president [[Hu Jintao]].<ref name="MSNBC 2009-01-30" /> When [[Nino Salukvadze]] of Georgia won the bronze medal in the [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics|10&nbsp;meter air pistol]] competition, she stood on the medal podium with [[Natalia Paderina]], a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicized event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=10 August 2008 | date=10 August 2008}}</ref>

Terrorism has only affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] were held in [[Munich]], Germany, eleven members of the [[Israel at the Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]] were taken hostage by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] in what is now known as the [[Munich massacre]]. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and 5 terrorists also perished.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic archive|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref>

Terrorism affected the last two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 1996]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb]] was detonated at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which killed two and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by [[Eric Rudolph]], an [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|American domestic terrorist]], who is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> The [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], took place just five months after the [[September 11 attacks]], which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic games. The opening ceremonies of the games, the first to take place since that day, featured signs of the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|aftermath of that day's event]]s. They included the flag that flew at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer [[Daniel Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] singing "[[God Bless America]]", and honor guards of NYPD and [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] members. The events of that day has made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern and focus for Olympic planners to avoid a large scale terrorist attack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/05/03/ioc-bin-laden-killing-no-bearing-olympic-security|title=IOC on bin Laden killing: no bearing on Olympic security|date=3 May 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref>

== Citizenship ==

=== IOC rules for citizenship ===

The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country they compete for. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed between when the competitor competed for his former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period.{{r|Olympic Charter 2011}} This waiting period exists only for those who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, they do not have to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.{{sfn|Shachar|2011|pp=2114<U+2013>2116}}

=== Reasons for changing citizenship ===

Sometimes, athletes become citizens of new nations solely for the purpose of competing in the Olympics. This usually happens either because people are drawn to sponsorships and training facilities in places like the United States or because an athlete does not qualify in their original country. This is usually because there are many qualified athletes in an athlete<U+2019>s home country and they want to be able to participate as well as help the team of their new country. Between 1992 and 2008, there were about fifty athletes that have emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

=== Citizenship changes and disputes ===

One of the most famous cases of changing nationality for the Olympics was [[Zola Budd]], a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because there was an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa. Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born there, but British citizens accused the government of expediting the citizenship process for her.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/feb/24/athletics.rorycarroll |title=What Zola Budd did next &#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= 24 February 2003|accessdate=27 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

Other notable examples include Kenyan runner [[Bernard Lagat]] who became a United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics even though he had already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, leaving his silver medal in jeopardy. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/lagat-a-runner-without-a-.shtml |title=Lagat a runner without a country |publisher=Cool Running |date= |accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> Basketball player [[Becky Hammon]] was not being considered for the United States Olympic team but wanted to play in an Olympic Games, so she emigrated to Russia where she already played in a domestic league during the WNBA offseason. Hammon received criticism from some Americans, including the US national team coach, even being called unpatriotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3427182 |title=Olympics opportunity too much for Hammon to pass up <U+2013> Olympics <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>

== Champions and medalists ==

{{further|Lists of Olympic medalists|List of multiple Olympic gold medalists}}

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal however must contain at least six grams of pure gold.<ref name="BeijingOlymp-1" /> The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a [[single-elimination tournament]] (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics|title=St Louis 1904|publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref> From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics as a measure of success.<ref>{{cite news|last=Munro|first=James|title=Britain may aim for third in 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7579901.stm|accessdate=25 August 2008}}</ref>

== Host nations and cities ==

[[File:Summer Olympics.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Summer Olympics locations. Countries that have hosted one Summer Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue.]]

{{main|List of Olympic Games host cities}}

The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration.<ref name="bidpro" /> The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organization of the Olympic Games.<ref name="hostcity" /> In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee.<ref name="bidpro" /> The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialized group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.<ref name="hostcity" />

Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analyzed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games.<ref name="bidpro" /> After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.<ref name="bidpro" />

By 2016, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92&nbsp;years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in [[Rio de Janeiro]] will be the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded.

The United States has hosted eight Olympic Games, four Summer and four Winter, more than any other nation. The British capital London holds the distinction of hosting three Olympic Games, all Summer, more than any other city.

The other nations hosting the Summer Games twice are Germany, Australia, France and Greece. The other cities hosting the Summer Games twice are Los Angeles, Paris and Athens.

In addition to the United States, nations hosting multiple Winter Games are France with three, while Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Japan, Canada and Italy have hosted twice. Among host cities, [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[Innsbruck]] and [[St. Moritz]] have played host to the Winter Olympic Games more than once, each holding that honor twice. The most recent Winter Games were held in [[Vancouver]], Canada's third Olympics overall. The next Winter Games will be in [[Sochi]] in 2014, [[Russia]]'s first Winter Olympics and second Olympics overall.
