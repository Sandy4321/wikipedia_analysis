'''Robert Lynn Bomar''' (January 21, 1901 <U+2013> June 11, 1964) was an [[American football]] [[End (American football)|end]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  He played [[college football]], [[basketball]], and [[baseball]] for [[Vanderbilt University]], following coach [[Wallace Wade]] and classmate [[Hek Wakefield]] there from [[University-preparatory school|prep school]], and in football was a unanimous [[College Football All-Southern Team|All-Southern]] selection in 1922 and consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] selection in 1923. The latter season included a first-team All-American selection by [[Walter Camp]], a rarity for a player in the [[Southern United States|South]]. A paralyzing injury ended his college career. He quickly recovered and sat on the bench for all of his team's games. He then went on to play for the [[New York Giants]] in 1925 and 1926 until stopping abruptly due to a separate injury. Bomar was nicknamed "The Blonde Bear."<ref name=vufactbook />

He later went on to have a career in law enforcement.  Bomar once held the title of [[Tennessee]]'s Commissioner of Public Safety and Patrol chief, in which capacity he most notably supervised the ransacking of black households in the panic of the [[Columbia, Tennessee#Columbia Race Riot of 1946|Columbia Race Riot]] of 1946. Bomar was then the [[Prison warden|warden]] of [[Tennessee State Prison]], serving at the position from 1955 until his death. He oversaw the execution of several men. In 1956 he became the first [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt football]] player elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

==Prep school==
Lynn was born on January 21, 1901, in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]] to Oliver Eugene Bomar and Elizabeth May McAdams.

Avid descriptions of his play include "The Blonde Bear was one of the world's greatest football players, who never missed an open field block.

Often he started games at [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], shifted to [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] or end, and finished at tackle. In backing up the line, "he hurled back all comers with the same savage vigor." His favorite refrain to opponents? "I-hope-you-don't-like-it."'<ref name="color">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WbsOIFMpPlQC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Color of the Law: Race, Violence, and Justice in the Post-World War II South |date=1999 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |author=Gail Williams O'Brien |pages=165<U+2013>170|isbn=9780807848029 }}</ref>

{{quote|Bomar of Vanderbilt is an experienced end of 200 pounds in weight, with speed, initiative, and an uncanny perception in diagnosing plays. Bomar can back up a line when needed, can not be swept out by swinging interference and is powerful enough to hold his own even when big guards and tackles come at him.

As a receiver of a [[forward pass]], he has, besides the skill, the excellent quality of being very hard to knock off his feet, and when he and the defense both try for the pass at the same time, Bomar is far more likely to get the ball on account of the fact that he outweighs the majority of defensive players. He has been used in all sorts of positions this year, both in attack and defense and this had broadened his scope and increased his value.<ref>{{Cite news |url= |title=West and South Recognized In Camp's 1923 Selections |last=Camp |first=Walter |date=December 19, 1923 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/1937350/camp_1923_all_america/|work=Times Herald|date=December 19, 1923|page=6|title=Walter Camp's Selections For All-American Football Eleven|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=March 8, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>}}

[[File:Bomar.png|right|thumb|130px|Lynn Bomar in Vanderbilt uniform.]]
{{Main|1924 Vanderbilt Commodores football team}}
During his senior season, in which he moved to halfback, the Commodores tied the [[Quantico Marines]] 13<U+2013>13. Bomar picked up a fumble and ran 84 yards for a touchdown. A newspaper account recalls, "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up what looked like a Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as [[Frank Goettge|Goettge]] repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his [[football helmet|headgear]]. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose."<ref name="50Years" /> Captain and guard [[Everett Kelly (American football)|Tuck Kelly]] was injured during this game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later in the game against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]].<ref>Vanderbilt Yearbook, The Commodore 1925. p. 124</ref>

Known especially as a devastating blocker and superb runner,<ref name="vufactbook" /> as well as "lightning fast,"<ref name="color" /> he was the first Commodore football player selected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1956. On his induction, Bomar remarked "I just wish all the men who played with me at Vanderbilt between 1921 and 1924 could also receive this coveted award.  They deserve it more than I do. After all, they made it possible for me to be chosen."<ref name="Traughber" />

[[File:1930 9Sep 21--NashvBanner--FredRussell--p1.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Fred Russell]] on the right c. 1930.]]
Bomar was a member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity. Nashville sportswriter [[Fred Russell]] entered Vanderbilt in 1924, and told this story of Bomar in his auto-biography ''Bury Me In An Old Press Box'': "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923...I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted [[firecracker]] I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his [[BVD]]'s chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me."<ref name=press />

Vanderbilt's All-Southern halfback, and captain-elect at the end of 1924, [[Gil Reese]] once recollected: "He would never let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would threaten me, Bomar was always right there to say; "Keep your hands off that boy." They always did, too. Bomar always looked after me, and he always called back to me when we started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar."<ref name="Traughber" /> Bomar and Reese were both on an All-time Vandy team published in Vanderbilt's yearbook in 1934. Bomar was chosen for an ''Associated Press'' Southeast Area All-Time football team 1920<U+2013>1969 era.<ref name="allse">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19690727&id=2eRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_f0MAAAAIBAJ&pg=2256,3526388 |newspaper=Gadsden Times |date=July 27, 1969 |title=All-Time Football Team Lists Greats Of Past, Present}}</ref>

Bomar fully recovered from his injury and played [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] as an [[End (American football)|end]] for the inaugural [[1925 New York Giants season|1925 New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) with the likes of [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Century Milstead]], and [[Owen Reynolds]].<ref name="vufactbook" /> Bomar was signed to the Giants by [[Harry March]].<ref name=giant />

The first game of note for Bomar came in a 14<U+2013>0 loss to the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]].  After a poor first half the Yellow Jackets were up 14. In the second half the Giants recovered slightly with good passes from [[Jack McBride]] to Bomar, but with no chance of a comeback. In a 13<U+2013>0 victory over the [[Rochester Jeffersons]] McBride threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. A 13<U+2013>12 win over the [[Providence Steam Roller]] featured a Bomar score and an interesting ending. A 24-yard pass from McBride to Bomar got a touchdown. As the game's end drew near the Giants were backed up near their own end zone, faced with a fourth down up 13<U+2013>10. Providence was set for an all-out blitz on the punter. The punter upon catching the ball knelt in the end zone for a [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]], not enough for Providence to win.
