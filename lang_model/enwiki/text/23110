==Political career==
Jim Naugle started in politics as a member of Fort Lauderdale city boards in 1976. Elected city [[Commissioner#United States|commissioner]] in 1985, he ran for city mayor and was elected in 1991.<ref name=MayorBio/> 

Fort Lauderdale has a [[Council-manager government|Commission-Manager]] form of government. City policy is set by a city commission of five elected members: the [[mayor]] and four [[district]] commission members. The mayor of Fort Lauderdale serves a three-year [[term]] and cannot serve more than three consecutive terms.<ref name=municode>{{cite web |url=http://www.municode.com/resources/gateway.asp?pid=10787&sid=9 |title=Fort Lauderdale Municipal Code Sec. 3.02.

==Political views==
Naugle has been a registered Democrat since he was 18,<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/> but he frequently supports Republican candidates.<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/> He co-chaired [[George W. Bush]]'s [[president]]ial campaign in [[2000]] and [[Jeb Bush]]'s bid for [[Governor]] in [[1998]]. In past presidential elections, he supported [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bob Dole]]<U+2014>all Republicans.<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/> Described as a "renegade democrat" by ''[[The Washington Post]]'',<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/> he said in 2000 that he votes for the candidate, not just the party. Asked why he never became a Republican, he said that as a [[non-partisan]] office holder, he did not see a reason to change, but that he would have to do "some soul-searching" if he ran for other offices.<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/> He qualifies himself as very conservative and willing to limit government.<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/>

==Controversy==
Naugle has said that the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] [[acronym]] ACLU means "Atheists and Criminal Lobbying Union"<ref name=DailyPulpPolInc/> and that a proposal for reducing [[greenhouse gases]] was "hate-America stuff" concocted by "a bunch of scientists meeting in Paris who've had too much wine."<ref name=coverstory>{{cite news |publisher=Sun-Sentinel|author=City Link Staff|url=http://www.southflorida.com/sfe-cl-050907cover,0,6818724.story |title=20 reasons South Florida doesn<U+2019>t suck |date=[[May 9]], [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> His view regarding [[homosexuality]] is that it is a [[sin]] and he has defended [[sodomy laws|anti-sodomy laws]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}} He stated that he does not support gay rights,{{Fact|date=June 2008}} but noted his working relationship with gay-rights activist Robin Bodiford as an example of his tolerance of differing viewpoints.  Comments Naugle made about alleged use of a planned $250,000 robotic toilet in Fort Lauderdale's beach to prevent sexual encounters between men caused protests from the local community.<ref name=toiletprotest>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/broward/sfl-79naugletoilet,0,105095.story?track=rss|title=Gay toilet paper protest targets Lauderdale mayor's robo-john comments|publisher=Associated Press/Sun-Sentinel|date=[[July 9]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

Naugle has had a long-running dispute with his constituency's largest regional newspaper, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''; he has claimed it should be called ''Rainbow Sentinel'' because of what he perceives as a majority of gay people on its staff, or ''Scum-Sentinel'' because they are "an advertising tabloid newsblog". He has stated "the day I take advice from a company that has vagrants selling their products in the middle of the street, we're all in trouble", referring to the publication's practice of employing [[homeless]] people as street salespeople.<ref name=RainbowSentinel>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2006/04/the_rainbow_sentinel.php |title=The Rainbow Sentinel? |author=Bob Norman |publisher=New Times |accessdate=2007-06-26 |date=[[April 26]], [[2006]]}}</ref>

Naugle denounced the [[LGBT]] [[Stonewall Library & Archives]] in 2007, because it contained pornographic materials.<ref name=herald>{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/466/story/166965.html |title=Mayor takes new jab at gays as library is OK'd |author=Martinez, Ani |publisher=''[[The Miami Herald]]'' |date=[[11 July]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref> Executive Director Jack Rutland noted that the three titles singled out by Naugle were all part of the library's non-circulating archive of 7000 titles, maintained for historical and research purposes only.<ref name=advocate>{{cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid47327.asp |title=Naugle notwithstanding, Fort Lauderdale to get new LGBT library |author=Wilcox, Barbara |publisher=''[[The Advocate]]'' |date=[[12 July]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref> On [[July 10]] [[2007]], the Fort Lauderdale city commission voted to allow the library to occupy a space in a building that is city-owned, but under long-term lease to Broward county.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/broward/sfl-flbmayocol19nbjul19,0,2663209.column|title=Fort Lauderdale mayor turning into his own worst enemy|author=Michael Mayo|date=[[July 19]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> On [[August 28]], [[2007]] the Broward (County) Tourism Development Council expelled Naugle due to his controversial remarks against the gay community.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cbs4.com/local/local_story_242082552.html |title=NAACP Call Mayor's Remarks Against Gay Hateful |publisher=CBS Broadcasting, Inc. |date=[[August 30]], [[2007]] 8:30 am |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> Estimates indicate that gay visitors pump approximately $1 billion in revenue into Broward County annually.

Naugle suggested that [[Bill Clinton]] should be investigated for raping [[Monica Lewinsky]].<ref name=DailyPulpPolIncRape>{{cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-10-26/news/politically-incorrect/|title=Politically Incorrect|author=Bob Norman|publisher=New Times|accessdate=2007-06-26|date=[[October 26]], [[2000]]|quote=Reporter:What are your thoughts on Bill Clinton?;Naugle:Is there a statute of limitation on rape?;Reporter:Do you think he's guilty of rape?;Naugle:I think it should be investigated.
