'''SRI International''' ('''SRI'''), founded as '''Stanford Research Institute''', is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[research institute]] headquarted in [[Menlo Park, California]]. The trustees of [[Stanford University]] established SRI in 1946 as a center of innovation to support economic development in the region. SRI is now one of the largest contract research institutes in the world.

The institute formally separated from Stanford University in 1970 and became known as SRI International in 1977. SRI describes its mission as discovery and the application of science and technology for knowledge, commerce, prosperity, and peace.<ref name="about"/> It performs client-sponsored [[research and development]] for government agencies, commercial businesses, and private foundations. It also licenses its technologies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/engage/products-solutions#Technologies for License|title=Products + Solutions: Technologies for License|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> forms strategic partnerships, and creates [[Research spin-off|spin-off]] companies.<ref name="spin">{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/engage/ventures|title=SRI Ventures|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>

==History==
===Foundation===
In the 1920s, [[Stanford University]] professor [[Robert E. Swain]] proposed creating a research institute in the [[Western United States]]. [[Herbert Hoover]], then a trustee of Stanford University, was also an early proponent of an institute, but became less involved with the project after he was elected president of the United States. The development of the institute was delayed by the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and [[World War II]] in the 1940s,<ref name="n1-1">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. 1-1]]</ref> with three separate attempts leading to its formation in 1946.

In August 1945, [[Maurice Nelles]], Morlan A. Visel, and Ernest L. Black of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] made the first attempt to create the institute with the formation of the "Pacific Research Foundation" in Los Angeles.<ref name="nB-1">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. B-1]]</ref> A second attempt was made by [[Henry T. Heald]], then president of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].  In 1945, Heald wrote a report recommending a research institute on the West Coast and a close association with Stanford University with an initial grant of $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|500000|1945|{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}|-3}}}} today).<ref name="nB-2">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. B-2]]</ref>{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}}  A third attempt was made by [[Frederick Terman|Fred Terman]], Stanford University's dean of engineering. Terman's proposal followed Heald's, but focused on faculty and student research more than contract research.<ref name="nB-2"/>

The [[trustee]]s of Stanford University voted to create the organization in 1946.  It was structured so that its goals were aligned with the charter of the university<U+2014>to advance scientific knowledge and to benefit the public at large, not just the students of Stanford University.<ref name="nB-2"/> The trustees were named as the corporation's [[board of directors|general members]], and elected SRI's directors (later known as presidents); if the organization were dissolved, its assets would return to Stanford University.<ref name="nB-3">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. B-3]]</ref> 

Research chemist [[William F. Talbot]] became the first director of the institute.<ref name="nB-3"/> Stanford University president [[Donald Tresidder]] instructed Talbot to avoid work that would conflict with the interests of the university, particularly federal contracts that might attract political pressure.<ref name="nB-3"/> The drive to find work and the lack of support from Stanford faculty caused the new research institute to violate this directive six months later through the pursuit of a contract with the [[Office of Naval Research]].<ref name="nB-4">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. B-4]]</ref> This and other issues,  including frustration with Tresidder's micromanagement of the new organization, caused Talbot to repeatedly offer his resignation, which Tresidder eventually accepted.<ref name="f111">[[#Founding|Gibson, SRI: The Founding Years, pp. 111-112]]</ref> Talbot was replaced by [[Jesse E. Hobson|Jesse Hobson]], who had previously led the [[Armour Research Foundation]], but the pursuit of contract work remained.<ref name="exploit">{{cite news|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/1997/julaug/articles/exploit.html|title=Exploiting a Wonderful Opportunity|first=Rebecca|last=Lowen|work=Stanford Magazine|publisher=Stanford Alumni Association|date=July/August 1997|accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:SRI Air Pollution study 1949.jpg|thumb|right|225px|SRI participant [[Paul Magill]] discussing the smog on Black Friday in Los Angeles at the first air pollution conference in 1949]]
SRI's first research project investigated whether the [[guayule]] plant could be used as a source of [[natural rubber]].<ref name="f98">[[#Founding|Gibson, SRI: The Founding Years, pp. 98-99]]</ref> During [[World War II]], rubber was imported into the U.S. and was subject to shortages and strict rationing.<ref name="f98"/> From 1942 to 1946, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) supported a project to create a domestic source of natural rubber.  Once the war ended, the United States Congress cut funding for the program; in response, the [[Office of Naval Research]] created a grant for the project to continue at SRI, and the USDA staff on the project worked through SRI until Congress reauthorized funding in 1947.<ref name="f98"/>

SRI's first economic study was for the United States Air Force.  In  1947, the Air Force wanted to determine the expansion potential of the U.S. aircraft industry; SRI found that it would take too long to escalate production in an emergency.<ref name="f108">[[#Founding|Gibson, SRI: The Founding Years, p. 108]]</ref> In 1948, SRI began research and consultation with [[Chevron Corporation]] to develop an artificial substitute for [[tallow]] and [[coconut oil]] in soap production; SRI's investigation confirmed the potential of [[dodecyl benzene]] as a suitable replacement.  Later, [[Procter & Gamble]] used the substance as the basis for [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] laundry [[detergent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/tide.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061130143742/http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/tide.html|archivedate=2006-11-30|title=Tide|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>

The institute performed much of the early research on [[air pollution]] and the formation of [[ozone]] in the lower atmosphere.<ref name="n9-18">[[#Nielson|Nielson, pp. 9-18 - 9-21]]</ref> SRI sponsored the First National Air Pollution Symposium in [[Pasadena, California]], in November 1949.<ref name="n9-18"/> Experts gave presentations on pollution research, exchanged ideas and techniques, and stimulated  interest in the field.  The event was attended by 400 scientists, business executives, and civic leaders from the  U.S.<ref name="n9-18"/> SRI co-sponsored subsequent events on the subject.<ref>{{cite book | first = Weldon B. | last = Gibson | authorlink = Weldon B.

[[File:SRI ERMA MICR montage.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting|ERMA]] system, which uses [[magnetic ink character recognition]] to process checks, was one of SRI's earliest developments.]]
In the early 1950s, [[Walt Disney|Walt]] and [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] consulted with SRI on their proposal for [[Disneyland]] in [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank]], [[California]].<ref name="n14-17">[[#Nielson|Nielson, pp. 14-17 - 14-20]]</ref> SRI provided information on location, attendance patterns, and economic feasibility.

In 1952, the [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor Corporation]] contracted with SRI to develop a near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying.<ref name="mc39">[[#McLaughlin|McLaughlin, p. 39]]</ref> In 1959, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design and development of the Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry.<ref name="mc40">[[#McLaughlin|McLaughlin, p. 40]]</ref> In 1954, [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to [[William K. MacCurdy]]'s development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.<ref name="n6-1">[[#Nielson|Nielson, pp. 6-1 - 6-3]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/hydracushion.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061130143710/http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/hydracushion.html|archivedate=2006-11-30|title=Railroad Hydracushion|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2012-04-08}}</ref>

In the 1950s, SRI worked under the direction of the [[Bank of America]] to develop ERMA ([[Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting]]) and [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR).  The ERMA project was led by computer scientist [[Jerre Noe]], who was at the time SRI's assistant director of engineering.<ref name="n2-8">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. 2-8]]</ref>  As of 2011, ERMA remains the industry standard in automated check processing.<ref name="n2-1">[[#Nielson|Nielson, p. 2-1]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/work/timeline/erma-micr|title=Timeline of Innovations: Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref><ref name="MICR standardr">{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/magnetic-ink-character-recognition-line/|title=Magnetic Ink Character Recognition Line Law & Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

[[File:SRI Packet Radio Van.jpg|thumb|left|A packet radio van, site of the first three-way [[Internetworking|internetworked]] transmission]]
On October 29, 1969, the world's first electronic computer network, [[ARPANET]], was established between nodes at [[Leonard Kleinrock]]'s lab at [[UCLA]] and Douglas Engelbart's lab at SRI. [[Interface Message Processors]] at both sites served as the [[Internet backbone|backbone]] of the first [[Internet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/Internet-Began-35-Years-Ago-at-5464.aspx|title=Internet Began 35 Years Ago at UCLA with First Message Ever Sent Between Two Computers|first=Chris|last=Sutton|publisher=UCLA|date=2004-09-14|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref><ref>[[#Bridge|DARPA, pp. 79-83]]</ref> The following year, Engelbart's lab installed the first [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] system outside of [[BBN Technologies|BBN]] where it was developed.
