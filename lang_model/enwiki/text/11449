The '''Battle of Alexandretta''' was the first clash between the forces of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]]. It was fought in early 971 near [[Alexandretta]], while the main Fatimid army was besieging [[Antioch]], which the Byzantines had captured two years previously. The Fatimid defeat at Alexandretta, coupled with the [[Qarmatian]] invasion of southern Syria, forced the Fatimids to lift the siege and secured Byzantine control of Antioch and northern Syria.

==Background==
On 28 October 969, [[Antioch]] fell to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] commander [[Michael Bourtzes]].{{sfn|Honigmann|1935|p=94}} The fall of the great metropolis of northern Syria was soon followed by a treaty between the Byzantines and the [[Hamdanid]] [[Emirate of Aleppo]], which made Aleppo a tributary vassal and handed over to the Byzantine Empire the entirety of the former [[Abbasid]] frontier zones (''[[thughur]]'') in [[Cilicia]] and [[Upper Mesopotamia]], as well as the coastal strip of Syria between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Orontes River]] until the environs of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], [[Arqa]], and [[Shayzar]].{{sfn|Honigmann|1935|pp=94<U+2013>97}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=507}} Byzantine control of this area was initially only theoretical, and the murder of the Byzantine emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] in December 969 threatened to nullify Byzantine gains in the region.{{sfn|Honigmann|1935|p=97}} 

Further south, the troops of the [[Fatimids]] of [[Ifriqiya]], under the command of [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]], had just conquered [[Egypt]] from its [[Ikhshidid]] rulers. Seized with the spirit of ''[[jihad]]'' and aiming to legitimize their rule, the Fatimids used the Byzantine advance on Antioch and the "[[infidel]]" threat as a major item in their propaganda aimed towards the newly conquered region, along with promises to restore just government.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=295<U+2013>308}} The news of Antioch's fall helped to persuade the Fatimids to allow Jawhar to send [[Ja'far ibn Falah]] to invade [[Palestine]]. Ja'far defeated the last Ikhshidid remnants under [[al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj]] and took [[Ramla]] in May 970, before occupying [[Damascus]] in October.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=308, 312<U+2013>313}}

==Siege of Antioch and battle at Alexandretta==
Almost as soon as Damascus submitted, Ja'far ibn Falah entrusted one of his ''[[ghilman]]'', named Futuh ("Victories"), to carry out the promised ''jihad'' against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=313}} although the 15th-century compialtion ''Uyun al-Akhbar'' by the [[Yemen]]i historian [[Imad al-Din Idris ibn al-Hasan]] also mentions a certain Abdallah ibn Ubayd Allah al-Husayni Akhu Muslim as commander.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=433<U+2013>434}} Futuh assembled a large army of [[Kutama]] [[Berbers]], strengthened with levies from Palestine and southern Syria, and moved to besiege Antioch in December 970. The Byzantine writer [[Kedrenos]] claims that the Fatimid army numbered a clearly much exaggerated 100,000 men, but Imad al-Din records the number as 20,000 men.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=431<U+2013>439}} The Fatimids laid siege to the city, but its inhabitants offered stiff resistance, and Ibn Falah had to send "army after army" according to the 14th-century historian [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Dawadari]], apparently from the levies raised in southern Syria, to its reinforcement. According to the 15th-century Egyptian [[al-Maqrizi]], it was with these additional troops, which he puts at 4,000 men, that it became possible to completely halt the city's resupply by intercepting the caravans headed towards it.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=435<U+2013>437}}

In the meantime, Nikephoros' murderer and successor, [[John I Tzimiskes]], was unable to intervene in person in the east due to the more menacing [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|invasion of the Balkans]] by [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]].{{sfn|Honigmann|1935|p=97}}{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=432}} As a result, he sent a small force under a trusted [[eunuch]] of his household, the ''[[patrikios]]'' Nicholas, who according to the contemporary [[Leo the Deacon]] was experienced in battle, to relieve the siege.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=432<U+2013>433}} In the meantime, the siege of Antioch had continued for five months over winter and into spring, without result. At some point, a Fatimid detachment<U+2014>according to Ibn al-Dawadari 4,000 men under a Berber chieftain called Aras and a former emir of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] [[Ibn az-Zayyat]]<U+2014>moved north against [[Alexandretta]], where the Byzantine relief army had camped. Informed of their approach, the Byzantine commander vacated the camp and placed his troops in ambush. Finding the enemy encampment deserted, the Fatimid troops began to plunder it, heedless of anything else. At that moment, Nicholas launched a surprise attack from all sides and the Fatimid force disintegrated; most of the Muslim army, perished, but Aras with Ibn az-Zayyat managed to escape.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=431<U+2013>439}}

The defeat at Alexandretta was a major blow to Fatimid morale. Coupled with news of the advance of the [[Qarmatians]] against Damascus, Ibn Falah ordered Futuh to raise the siege of Antioch in early July 971. The army returned to Damascus, whence the various contingents dispersed to their home districts.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=431<U+2013>439}}

==Aftermath==
The fist clash between the eastern Mediterranean's two foremost powers{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=432}} thus ended in a Byzantine victory, which on the one hand strengthened the Byzantine position in northern Syria and on the other weakened the Fatimids, both in lives lost and in morale and reputation. As the historian Paul Walker writes, had Ibn Falah "possessed the troops and the prestige lost at Alexandretta, he might have resisted the onrush of the Qarmatians. The armies of the local districts might have aided him had they not dispersed".{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=439<U+2013>440}} In the event, Ja'far was unable to resist the Qarmatians and their Arab [[Bedouin]] allies; making the fatal choice of confronting them in the desert, he was defeated and killed in battle in August 971.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=313<U+2013>314}} It was a defeat that signalled the near total collapse of Fatimid control in southern Syria and Palestine, and the Qarmatian invasion of Egypt. The Fatimids were victorious before [[Fustat]], however, and eventually managed to drive the Qarmatians out of Syria and restore their control over the restive province.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=314<U+2013>315, 346}} The Byzantines remained quiescent until the great campaigns led by John Tzimiskes in person in 974<U+2013>975. Although the emperor advanced deep in Muslim lands and even threatened to take Jerusalem, his death in January 976 lifted the Byzantine danger for the Fatimids: the Byzantines would never again try to advance far beyond their northern Syrian possessions around Antioch.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=331, 346}}{{sfn|Honigmann|1935|pp=98<U+2013>103}}
