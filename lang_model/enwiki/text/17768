==Responsibilities==
It was the responsibility of the Board to meet semi-annually to consult and to adopt such measures as may best promote the progress of the viticultural industries of the State. It was their duty to select and appoint competent and qualified persons to deliver at least one lecture each year in each of the viticultural districts, for the purpose of illustrating practical viticultural topics, and imparting instruction in methods of culture, pruning, fertilizing, fermenting, distilling, and rectifying, treating diseases of the vine, raisin drying, and others, and to disseminate useful knowledge relating to viticulture by printed documents or correspondence. The Board devoted especial attention to the study of the phylloxera and other diseases of the vine, and made recommendations in their semi-annual reports regarding the protection of vineyards.<ref name=Commissioners1881 />
