The '''Chitpavan''' or '''Chitpawan''', also known as  '''Konkanastha Brahmins''' (<U+0915><U+094B><U+0915><U+0923><U+0938><U+094D><U+0925> <U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+093E><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E><U+0923>), are a [[Smarta]] [[Brahmin]] community of [[Konkan]], the coastal region of western [[Maharashtra]] in [[India]].

During the reign of the successive Peshwas, some of whom enjoyed status as ''de facto'' head of the [[Maratha confederacy]], the Chitpavans settled in various provinces under the Peshwa rule. The Chitpavans established themselves firmly in the social hierarchy of the Marathi-speaking region, and played a prominent role in the political history of India.<ref name="heh_nizam">{{cite book

===DNA analysis, Turko-Iranian origin===
A 2005 study conducted by Sonali Gaikwad and VK Kashyap for National DNA Analysis Center, [[Central Forensic Science Laboratory]], Kolkata, suggests that the Chitpavans may have roots outside of India, in either Iran or Turkey. The authors state that the Chitpavan were amalgamated and Brahminized at a late date in the Indian society.<ref name="gaikwad_kashyap">{{cite journal|author=Sonali Gaikwad, V.

===Jewish origin===
A link between the Chitpavan and the Bene Israel has also been suggested. The Parshuram origin of the Chitpavan is identical to the story of origins of the Bene Israel from the Kolaba district. The Bene Israel claim that they share a common origin with the Chitpavan. According to Bene Israeli legend, the Chitpavan and Bene Israel are descendants from a group of 14 people shipwrecked off the Konkan coast. One group converted to Hinduism as Chitpavan Brahmins, the other remained Jewish or Bene Israel.<ref name="lemba">{{cite journal|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/liorg/lemba.pdf| title=Genetics, History, and Identity: The Case Of The Bene Israel and the Lemba|author=T.

== History ==
=== Rise during the Maratha rule ===
[[File:Madhu Rao Narayan the Maratha Peshwa with Nana Fadnavis and attendants Poona 1792 by James Wales.jpg|Peshwa [[Madhavrao II]] with [[Nana Fadnavis]] and attendants, at Pune in 1792|thumb|left]]
{{Main|Peshwa}}

Very little is known of the Chitpavan before 1707 A.D.<ref name="cohn_singer"/> Sometime around this time, an individual of the Chitpavan community, Balaji Vishwanth Bhat arrived from Ratnagari to the Pune-Satara area. He was brought there on the basis of his reputation of being an efficient administrator. He quickly gained the attention of Chhatrapati Shahu and his work so pleased the Chhatrapati that he was appointed the Peshwa or Chief Minister in 1713. He ran a well organized administration and by the time of his death in 1720, he had laid the groundwork for the expansion of the Maratha Empire. Since this time until the fall of the Maratha Empire, the seat of the Peshwa would be held by the members of the Chitpavan family. As Peshwa became ecclesiastical head of the state, this was not consequent upon the Peshwa's social position as a Brahman, for the chitpavan sect, to which the Peshwas belonged, was not accounted of much importance by other Brahmanic sects and by some, indeed, was considered ineligible for inclusion in the Brahmanic category.<ref>{{cite book|author=H.

=== Role in the Indian politics ===
[[File:Bal G. Tilak.jpg|Bal Gangadhar Tilak|thumb|right]]
After the fall of the Maratha Empire in 1818, the Chitpavan lost their political dominance to the British. The British would not subsidize the Chitpavans on the same scale that their caste-fellow, the Peshwas had done in the past. Pay and power was now significantly reduced.  Poorer Chitpavan students adapted and started learning English because of better opportunities in the British administration.<ref name="leach_mukherjee"/> The Chitapavan Brahmins such as [[Vasudev Balwant Phadke]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] played an important role in the [[Indian independence movement]].

Some of the prominent figures in the [[Hindu reform movements]] of the 19th and 20th centuries came from the Chitapavan Brahmin community. These included [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]], Justice [[Mahadev Govind Ranade]], [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]], [[Gopal Ganesh Agarkar]] and [[Vinoba Bhave]]. These reforms preached against the Hindu caste system. Yet, some of the strongest resistance to change also came from the very same community. Jealously guarding their Brahmin stature, the orthodox among the Chitpavans were not eager to see the Shastras challenged, nor the conduct of the Brahmins becoming indistinguishable from that of the Sudras. The vanguard and the old guard clashed many times. Ranade and other reformers were forced to offer penance for breaking purity rules. D. K. Karve was ostracised. Even Tilak made a visit to Varanasi so that he may not be excommunicated.

The Chitpavan community produced two major politicians in the [[Gandhism|Gandhian tradition]]: Vinoba Bhave and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Gandhi describes Bhave as the Jewel of his disciples, and recognized Gokhale as his political guru. However, strong opposition to Gandhi also came from within the Chitpavan community. [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar|V D Savarkar]], the founder of the Hindu nationalist political ideology [[Hindutva]], was a Chitpavan Brahmin. Several members of the Chitpavan community were among the first to embrace the Hindutva ideology, which they thought was a logical extension of the legacy of the Peshwas and caste-fellow Tilak.<ref name="das_kop">{{Cite journal|accessdate=June 29, 2010|url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/03081998/cover.html|title=Godse on Trial |author=Swapan Dasgupta, Smruti Koppikar|date=August 3, 1998|journal=India Today|pages=24<U+2013>26|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> These Chitpavans felt out of place with the Indian social reform movement of Mahatama Phule and the mass politics of Mahatama Gandhi. Large numbers of the community looked to Savarkar, the Hindu Mahasabha and finally the RSS for inspiration resulting in the likes of [[Narayan Apte]] and [[Nathuram Godse]], who assassinated Gandhi on January 30, 1948.<ref name="gol_seg">{{cite book|author=Arnold P.

Many members of the Pune's closely-knit Chitpavan community supported Gandhi's murder, prompting [[Rafiq Zakaria]] to compare them with the [[neo-Nazi]]s in Europe.<ref name="zak">{{cite book|title=Gandhi and the break-up of India|author=Rafiq Zakaria|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya mBhavan|year=1999|pages=6|subject=History|isbn=}}</ref>

== Culture ==
The Chitpavan Brahmins celebrate several festivals according to the [[Hindu Calendar]].

Traditionally, the Chitpavan Brahmins were a community of priests who offer religious services to other communities. The 20th century descriptions of the Chitpavans list frugality, hard work, cleanliness and intelligence as their attributes.<ref name="kurtz">{{cite book|title=Contradictions and Conflict: A Dialectical Political Anthropology of a University in Western India|author= Donald V.

Later, Chitpavans became became prominent in various white collar jobs and business.

Chitpavans are traditionally strict vegetarians. The staple cereal is rice, while pulses include tur dal. The cooking media include groundnut oil and sunflower oil. They consume dairy products; take both tea and coffee, while consumption of tobacco products and  betel leaves is prevalent.

Monogamy is practiced by Konkanastha Brahmins. At present adult marriage is practiced, while child marriage was acceptable in the past, requiring the release of children to their marital partners at the coming of age. Marital matches arranged by parents, with the consent of the individuals, is the most widespread mode of acquiring a mate. The symbols of marriage include a spot of vermillion on the forehead, a mangal sutra and toe rings. The bride is often expected to reside at the groom's family home after marriage. Remarriage is allowed for widows, widowers and divorcee. Equigeniture is the rule, as Women also inherit paternal property. The marriage is fixed by consulting the horoscopes of the bride and groom. The marriage takes place at brides place. Haldi (turmeric paste) is applied to both the bride and groom by married women. After kanyadaan, malabadal is done where in the bride and groom put garlands around each other's neck, along with the observance of offering worship at sacred fire(hom). The groom ties the mangal sutra around the neck of the bride.

On child birth, Shastipujan is done on the sixth day. On the 12th day the name giving ceremony is performed. The 'jawal' (head shaving) is performed both for male and female children after attaining the age of one year. At eight years a male child undergoes another shaving of his head for his Upanayana, Munja or sacred thread ceremony. The shaving is done by a barber and the rituals are officiated over by a Brahmin priest. Mundan is not performed for girl child, it is a sanskar that is performed on boy child.

=== Language ===
Most of the Chitpavan Brahmins in Maharashtra have adopted Marathi as their language. Till the 1940s, most of the Chitpavans in Konkan spoke a dialect called Chitpavani Konkani in their homes. Even at that time, reports  recorded Chitpavani as a fast disappearing language.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|author=Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|year=1941|pages=286}}</ref> There are no inherently nasalized vowels in standard Marathi whereas the Chitpavani dialect of Marathi does have nasalized vowels.<ref name="wali_dhongade">{{cite book|title=Marathi|author=Rame<U+015B>a Dho<U+1E45>ga<U+1E0D>e, Kashi Wali|isbn=9789027288837|year=2009|pages=11}}</ref>

=== Society ===
The Chitpavan Brahmins have two sub-groups: the Rigvedi Konkanastha and the Yajurvedi Konkanastha. They belong to the [[Smartha]] Sect. The community comprises fourteen gotras (clans) which as one of the regulators of marriage the gotras are linked with mythical sains and sages and are not hierarchically arranged. The gotras are Atri, Kapi, Kashyap, Kondinya, Gargya, Kaushik, Jamadagni, Nityundana, Bhargava, Bharadwaj, Vatsya, Vashistha, Vishnuvruddha and Shandilya. All the fourteen gotras are clustered into seven groups which are known as the gana. A gotra belonging to a particular gana cannot be considered for marriage with another gotra of same gana. The gana are as follows:- Atri-Kapi, Gargya-Bhardwaj, Koundiya-Vashistha, Kashyap-Shandilya, Kaushik-Bhargava, Jamadagni-Vatsa, Nityundana-Vishnuvruddha. Besides gotra and gana, konkanastha brahmins observe the Tri (three) and Panch (Five) Pravara system. Chitpavans also revere deities connected with gotras known as the devakas and each family worships it's devaka at the time of marriage, while individuals with the same devaka can marry. There are four hundred and forty surnames amongst Konkanastha Brahmins.

=== Social status ===
Earlier, the [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s believed that they were the highest of all Brahmins, and looked down upon the Chitpavans as ''parvenus'' (a relative newcomer to a socioeconomic class), barely equal to the noblest of [[dvija]]s. Even the Peshwa was denied the rights to use the [[ghat]]s reserved for Deshasth priests at [[Nashik]] on the Godavari.<ref>Ravinder Kumar ''Western India in the Nineteenth Century''</ref> Most of the administrators in the Maratha kingdom of [[Shivaji]] were Deshastha Brahmins and [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu]]. However, the Deshastha influence waned during the rule of [[Nanasaheb Peshwa]], except for the post of <U+201C>Panditrao<U+201D> (Minister related to Religious issues) and Chief Justice. Other valuable posts like Phadanvis (Finance Secretary), Kotwal (Home Secretary) and various military rank were dominated by Chitpavans.

This usurping of power by Chitpavans from Deshastha Brahmins resulted in intense rivalry between the two communities in the later days. The 19th century records mention ''Gramanyas'' between the Chitpavans, the [[Daivajna]]s, and the [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus]], which lasted for about ten years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Th<U+0101>kare|first=Ke<U+015B>ava Sit<U+0101>r<U+0101>ma|title=Gr<U+0101>ma<U+1E47>y<U+0101>c<U+0101> s<U+0101>dyanta itih<U+0101>sa arth<U+0101>ta nokar<U+015B><U+0101>h<U+012B>ce ban<U+1E0D>a|location=Mumbai|year=1919|language=Mar<U+0101><U+1E6D>h<U+012B>}}</ref> Since Independence the rivalry between the groups has waned, as evident by the inter-community marriages and inter-mixing of them at social, professional and political level.
