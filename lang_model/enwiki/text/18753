'''Dylan Thomas Sprouse''' and '''Cole Mitchell Sprouse''' (born August 4, 1992) are American actors. They are twins and are collectively referred to as '''Dylan and Cole Sprouse''' or the '''Sprouse brothers''', usually abbreviated as '''Sprouse Bros'''. Their first major theatrical film role was in ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'', where they starred alongside [[Adam Sandler]]. They later appeared in several television [[sitcom]]s and starred in the straight-to-DVD films, ''[[I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus (film)|I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus]]'' and ''[[Just for Kicks (2003 film)|Just for Kicks]]''.

In 2005, they starred in the [[Disney Channel]] sitcom ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''. As a result of the series' success, the media has termed them "heartthrobs" and "overwhelming draws" among preteen and teen audiences.<ref name="early show">{{cite web | author=James M.

The majority of the Sprouses' franchise ended in 2008, except for their clothing line. ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'' was retooled in 2008 as ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'', in which the brothers reprised their roles as Zack and Cody. ''The Suite Life on Deck'' went on to become the most-watched tween/children's television show in 2008 and 2009.<ref name="early show"/>  The show ended in May 2011. They also starred in the ''The Suite Life Movie'', which aired in March of the same year. They began cultivating an adult image by starring in the independent theatrical suspense film, ''[[The Kings of Appletown]]'' in 2009.

Dylan and Cole were two of the wealthiest children alive in 2007, and in 2010, the Sprouse brothers were the highest paid teenage Disney television actors, earning $40,000 per episode combined.<ref name="richest">{{cite web| date=July 2007|work=People.com | title= Richest children |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20061420,00.html|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref><ref name="toppaid2">{{cite web| date=July, 2006|work=Popeater.com|title=TV's Highest-Paid Kid Actors (Surprise!

== Personal lives ==
Dylan Sprouse has stated that the experience of coming to fame after the success of ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'' is "kind of scary, how fast everything is moving" and that a year prior  "none of this was happening, it was just doing ''Suite Life''," and that he couldn't wait for the future.<ref name="bahney" /> While filming ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'', the two received on-set tutoring for three hours each day, and said they were getting "straight A's and honors."<ref name="early show" /><ref name="parade"/> In their last year of high school, the brothers both took [[Advanced Placement]] classes.
