'''Tyldesley''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>t<U+026A>lzli<U+02D0>}} or {{IPA-en|<U+02C8>t<U+026A>lsli<U+02D0>|}}) is a town within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2008-06-17|date= 2003-07-31}}</ref> It occupies an area north of [[Chat Moss]] near the foothills of the [[West Pennine Moors]], {{convert|7.7|mi|km|1}} east-southeast of [[Wigan]] and {{convert|8.9|mi|km|1}} west-northwest of the city of [[Manchester]]. At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]], Tyldesley, which includes the outlying areas of [[Astley, Greater Manchester|Astley]], [[Shakerley]], and [[Mosley Common]], had a population of 34,000.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Tyldesley and its surroundings have provided evidence for the remains of a [[Roman road]] passing through the area on the ancient course between ''Coccium'' (Wigan) and ''[[Mamucium]]'' (Manchester).<ref name="Council">{{citation|url=http://www.wigan.gov.uk/Services/BusinessRegeneration/RegenerationInitiatives/TownCentreManagement/Tyldesley.htm|title=Tyldesley|publisher=wigan.gov.uk|author=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=2009-07-13|date=}}</ref> Following the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]], Tyldesley was part of the manor of [[Warrington]], until the [[Norman conquest of England]], when Tyldesley constituted a [[Township (England)|township]] by the name of Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]].<ref name="GENUKI Parish map">{{cite web |title=TyldesleywithShakerley map|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/TyldesleywithShakerley/ParishMap.shtml |publisher=genuki.org.uk |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>

The [[factory system]], and [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], triggered a process of population growth and unplanned urbanisation in the area, such that by the early 20th century it was said that the newly emerged [[mill town]] was "eminently characteristic of an industrial district whose natural features have been almost entirely swept away to give place to factories, iron foundries, and collieries".<ref name=vch/> Although industrial activity declined in the late 20th century, [[land reclamation]] and [[post-war]] residential developments have continued to alter Tyldesley's landscape, and have encouraged renewed economic activity, particularly along Elliot Street<U+2014>Tyldesley's central commercial area and its main throughfare.<ref name="Council"/>

==History==
===Toponymy===
Tyldesley means "Tilwald's clearing", and is derived from the [[Old English]] (OE) [[personal name]] ''Tilwald'' (or ''T<U+012B>lwald'') and ''le<U+0103>h'' meaning "wood, clearing", suggesting that what is now open land was once covered with forest.<ref>Mills (1998), p. 355</ref> The name was recorded as ''Tildesleiha'' in about 1210. Alternative spellings include Tildeslei, Tildeslege, Tildeslegh, and Tildesley.<ref name=vch/>  Tyldesley is situated at the edge of the Lancashire Plain just to the north of [[Chat Moss]] and the Banks of Tyldesley are where the foothills of the Pennines begin. The land rises from {{convert|100|ft}} at the foot of the banks to {{convert|250|ft}} at the highest point. The banks are about one and a half miles long and gave the town its early name of Tildesley Banks. The name Tyldesley is pronounced "Til-slee", locally it is also known as "Bongs". In local pronunciation "Banks" became corrupted to "Bongs". '' Banks'' refers to the hill upon which the town was established. The old name for Mosley Common was the "Hurst" or "Tyldesleyhurst", the suffix "hyrst" being a wooded hill (OE).<ref>Mills (1998),p.404.</ref>

=== Earliest history ===

The earliest evidence of human activity in Tyldesley is the remains of a [[Roman road]] which ran through the area, serving the camps at ''Coccium'' ([[Wigan]]) and ''[[Mamucium]]'' ([[Manchester]]).<ref name="Council"/> The road ran from Keeper Delph in [[Boothstown]], north west, crossing Mort Lane in Tyldesley, north west of Cleworth Hall and south of Shakerley Old Hall which were sited closer to the Roman road than the present main road, Elliot Street.<ref name="Wigan Archaeological Society">{{cite web |title=Newsletter 71|url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/content/News_Letters/news071.htm|publisher=wiganarchsoc.co.uk |accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> 
It continued towards the Valley at Atherton where coins have been found, on towards Gibfield and hence towards Wigan.

In 1947 two urns containing about 550 Roman bronze coins, minted between AD&nbsp;259 and AD&nbsp;278, were found near the route of the ancient Roman road at Keeper Delph in Boothstown, near the old Tyldesley&ndash;Worsley border.<ref name="Council"/><ref name="Pastscape">{{cite web |title=Monument no. 44272 |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=44272 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> These coins are in the [[British Museum]].<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 7.</ref>  

After the [[Roman departure from Britain]], and into the [[history of Anglo-Saxon England]], nothing was written about Tyldesley. Evidence for the presence of [[Saxons]] in what became a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local place names that incorporate the Old English suffix of ''leah'', such as Tyldesley,<ref>Mills (1998), p. 355</ref> Shakerley, and Astley.<ref>Mills (1998), p. 17</ref>

=== Manor houses ===
The first [[Manor house]] in Tyldesley was Astley Hall or Damhouse, in 1212 the home of Hugh Tyldesley, Lord of the Manors of Astley and Tyldesley.<ref name="Tonge p5">Tonge (2002), p. 5.</ref> The hall is just inside the Tyldesley boundary but has been associated with Astley since the death of Henry Tyldesley in 1301, when the manor was divided among three of his sons. The Tyldesleys "were a family who gained a reputation for lawlessness and who had frequent disputes with their neighbours".<ref name="Tonge p5"/> One notable exception was Hugh Tyldesley or Hugh the Pious,<ref name="Lunn p10">Lunn (1995), p. 10.</ref> who before his death in 1226 endowed a monastery, [[Cockersand Abbey]] in North Lancashire, granting it the lands of [[Shakerley]], part of the Tyldesley lands. 

The new Manor of Tyldesley eventually became known as the Garrett or Garrett Hall and in 1505 was in the possession of John Tyldesley. Garrett Hall, a [[timber-framed]] structure, was first recorded in 1505 and remained in the Tyldesley family until 1652 when Lambert Tyldesley died leaving no heir.<ref name="A&W p28">Bond, Ackers & Ward (1979), p. 28.</ref> The new owners, the Stanleys, chose to live elsewhere and the hall was leased to tenant farmers. In 1732 the hall was sold to Thomas Clowes who continued leasing the property to tenants. In 1829 the hall became part of the Bridgewater Estates.<ref name="A&W p28"/><ref>{{Citation | title = Garrett Hall | url = http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=44270 | publisher = Pastscape.org.uk | accessdate = 2009-08-14}}</ref>  Generations of the Shakerley family lived in the hamlet of the same name at Shakerley Old Hall, close to the Shakerley Brook and the old road from Manchester to Wigan. They paid rent to Cockersand Abbey and dues of  "one pair of white gloves at the feast of Easter" to Adam Tyldesley.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 11.</ref> 

About half a mile from Garrett Hall, Chaddock Hall was home to a family of [[yeomen]] farmers with the same name. It was first mentioned in Lancashire Assizes Rolls from 1246, the name was spelt Chaydok, Lancashire Inquests from 1323 referred to Chaidoke and the Lancashire Lay [[Subsidy Roll]] in 1332 mentioned Chaidok. The last syllable probably is "oak". <ref name="Lunn p10">Lunn (1995), p. 10.</ref> It was central to a small hamlet of cottages that grew around it in the east of the township.  The Chaddocks, like the Tyldesleys and the Shakerleys, had a reputation for lawlessness.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 19.</ref> 

Cleworth Hall, Cluworth in 1333, an estate of {{convert|163|acre|km2}} on high ground near the centre of the township not far from the high road, was originally part of the Tyldesley lands.<ref name=vch/> In 1578 it passed into the hands of Nicholas Starkie through his marriage to Anne Parr and during his ownership in 1594 it became associated with [[witchcraft]].<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 27.</ref> Two children, John and Anne Starkie became "possessed of evil spirits". A well known "conjurer" or wise man, Edmund Hartley, was in the area and was asked to cure the children which he apparently did. Hartley demanded money but this was refused and he threatened trouble. Starkie denounced him and he was taken for trial at Lancaster Assizes in 1597 where he was tried and found guilty of witchcraft. Hartley was [[hanging|hanged]], twice, the rope broke at the first attempt.<ref>Poole (2002), p. 65.</ref> 

The tenants of the Tyldesley, Shakerley and Chaddock lands were often summoned to do military service.  [[Archer]]s from Chaddock fought at [[Cr<U+00E9>cy]] in 1346 and at [[Agincourt]] in 1415.<ref name="Lunn p20">Lunn (1995), p. 20.</ref> In 1360 William Chaddock was an archer on foot, "potens de corpore et bonis", or fit for active service in both body and accoutrements. A later muster roll shows Hugh Tyldesley to be an archer on horseback. Hugh Chaddock and Richard Tyldesley were both foot-archers serving under Herford.  They all drew daily pay for service from 22&nbsp;July to 21&nbsp;October 1391.<ref name="Lunn p20">Lunn (1995), p. 20.</ref>

Chaddock Hall and Dam House survive today, the former as a private residence and Dam House as a Heritage Centre having previously been used as the office block for Astley Hospital.<ref name="Tonge p5"/> Chaddock Hall is a Grade II [[Listed building]], as is Damhouse.<ref>{{Citation |title=Chaddock Hall |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=213509|publisher=Images of England |accessdate=2009-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Chaddock Hall |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=44271 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Damhouse |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=213512|publisher=Images of England |accessdate=2009-08-01 }}</ref>

=== Banks Estate ===

In the early 1700s Tyldesley had no clear centre, it was a collection of cottages and farms around the manor halls towards the east of the township. There was no church or inn. This was to change after 1728 when Thomas Johnson, a Bolton merchant bought land to the west of the township, the Banks Estate. He bought more land in 1742 from the Stanleys of Garrett Hall and 1752 bought Davenports Farm in the west of the township. He died in 1764 leaving the land to his grandson, also Thomas Johnson.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 57.</ref>  Thomas "Squire" Johnson began to develop the town of Tildesley Banks which became "Bongs". His name lives on in Squires Lane and Johnson Street.  The last quarter of the 18th century marked the beginning of a building boom in Tyldesley. The [[Grid plan|grid pattern]] of the present town is from this date.<ref>{{Citation |title=Historic Maps of Tyldesley|url=http://www.arnw02593.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/maps_of_tyldesley.htm|publisher=Tyldesley and District Historical Society |accessdate=2009-10-07 }}</ref>

This is how [[John Aikin]] described the area in 1795 in his book ''A Description of the Countryside from 30 to 40 Miles around Manchester'':<ref>Aikin (1795), pp. 299-300.</ref>
{{quote|The Banks of Tildesley, in the Parish of Leigh, are about one mile and a half in length, and command a most beautiful prospect into seven counties : the springs remarkably clear and most excellently adapted to the purposes of bleaching. The land is rich, but mostly in meadow and pastures, for milk butter, and the noted Leigh cheese. The estate had, in the year 1780, only two farm houses and eight or nine cottages, but now contains 162&nbsp;houses, a neat chapel, and 976&nbsp;inhabitants, who employ 325&nbsp;looms in the cotton Manufactories&nbsp;...}}

The Flaming Castle later the Castle Inn, at the top of Castle Street, was Tyldesley's first inn and dates from 1778.<ref>Lunn (1995), p.62.</ref> The Green Dragon, now the George, dates from 1781 but was rebuilt in 1904.<ref>Lunn (1995), pp. 62&ndash;63.</ref> Fullwell House was built in 1792, a substantial property at the western end of Squires Lane occupied by mill owners. It was demolished in 1935.<ref>Lunn (1995), p.63.</ref> At the same time rows of two-storey brick terraces were being built at the west end of the town to house the workers who had migrated to Tyldesley to work in the factories and mines.

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Tyldesley miners outside the Miners Hall during the 1926 General Strike.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Miners in Tyldesley during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]]. [[Coal mining]] was the dominant industry in Tyldesley for over 100&nbsp;years, until its decline following the Second World War.]]
Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], Tyldesley was broadly [[rural]] with scattered communities concentrated around the old manor halls. Agriculture and a cottage spinning and weaving industry, mainly [[muslin]] and [[fustian]],<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 28.</ref> were the chief occupations before 1800. [[Silk]] weaving became an important cottage industry in the Leigh, Astley and Tyldesley area after 1827 when silk was brought from Manchester.<ref>Holcroft (1998), p. 10.</ref>

In 1772 Thomas Johnson opened his "Little Factory" for [[carding]] and spinning [[cotton]]. He opened "The Great Leviathon", a steam driven mill on Factory Street, for woollen spinning in 1792 but this quickly became a [[cotton mill]]. More cotton mills grew up to the west of the township close to the Hindsford and Shakerley Brooks which provided them with water. New Mills was the name given to the complex owned by Messrs. J & G Jones around Factory Street. Joseph Wilson built a mill in nearby James Street which was extended and known as Hope Mill.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 71.</ref> By 1838 James Burton owned most of the mills in the west of the town. He lived in Charles Street surrounded by his workforce.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 77.</ref> His company owned 74&nbsp;cottages and 57&nbsp;cellars, a house in Elliot Street and the King's Arms public house. He died in 1868. In 1883 a fire at Burton's Mills caused <U+00A3>15,000 damage (<U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|15000|1883|r=-5}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} and by 1920 his mills were demolished.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 72.</ref>

Tyldesley's most famous millowner was [[Caleb Wright]], owner of the Barnfield Mills with a workforce of about 800. The last of Caleb Wright's mills, Barnfield No6 on Shuttle Street, was built in about 1894 on the site of an earlier mill<U+2014>Resolution Mill<U+2014>which was destroyed by fire in 1891. It was a concrete-floored multi-storey block for spinning, powered by an external engine house via a rope race.<ref>{{Citation | title = Barnfield Mill | url = http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1302494 | publisher = Pastscape.org.uk | accessdate = 2009-08-13}}</ref> It was demolished in the 1990s,<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 104.</ref> and the site is now occupied by a supermarket.

Coal had been mined in [[Shakerley]] in the 1400s. There is a record of a dispute between the Shakerleys and the Tyldesleys over the stealing of "seacoals" in 1429.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 24.</ref> Shakerley Colliery was in existence in 1798.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 67.</ref> Shakerley along with neighbouring [[Chowbent]], in [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]] was a centre for making [[nail (fastener)|nails]],<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 58.</ref> but was in decline by 1800. After 1800 Tyldesley grew to prominence, like many of its neighbours, through the [[coal]] and cotton industries.

[[Coal mining]] was the dominant industry in Tyldesley which was surrounded by collieries for over 100 years until its decline after the Second World War.<ref name=Collieries>{{cite web |title=NW Division map |url=http://www.cmhrc.co.uk/site/maps/lnw_map1.html|publisher=cmhrc.co.uk |accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Gin Pit closed in 1955, Cleworth in 1963, Nook two years later in 1965, and Mosley Common in 1968.

Another important employer in Tyldesley was Grundy's Foundry. Its founder was John Grundy a local shop keeper. His idea was a warm air heating system to heat churches and halls. He built a foundry close to the railway in Lower Elliot Street.<ref name="John Grundy">{{cite web |title=Victorian_Engineers |url=http://www.hevac-heritage.org/victorian_engineers/grundy/grundy.htm/ |publisher=hevac-heritage.org |accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref>

Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of the Leigh [[Poor Law Union]] which was established on 26 January 1837 comprising an area covering the whole of the ancient parish of Leigh and part of Winwick. There were [[workhouse]]s in existence in Pennington, Culcheth, Tyldesley and Lowton, but a central workhouse at Atherleigh replaced these in the 1850s. <ref name=Workhouses>{{cite web |title=Leigh |url= http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Leigh/Leigh.shtml|publisher=workhouses.org.uk |accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> In 1866 Tyldesley was constituted a separate [[civil parish]].<ref>Youngs (1991), p. 682.</ref> In 1863 the [[Local Government Act 1858]] was adopted for the township of Tyldesley-with-Shakerley, meaning it was governed by a [[local board of health]], a type of regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. The first Tyldesley Local Board of Health was formed after elections on 24 October 1863. Of those elected were local industrialists<U+2014>Caleb Wright and Oliver Burton, mill owners, William Ramsden and George Green, colliery owners. They were a mixture of [[Tories (political faction)|Tories]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. The local board took over the gas works in 1865, in 1876 built the first swimming baths, opened Tyldesley Cemetery in Hough Lane in 1876 and built sewage works at Morley's Hall in Astley in 1884. The offices of the local board were in Lower Elliot Street, where the council also had a fire station and depot.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 92.</ref> Under the [[Public Health Act 1875]] the local board gained additional duties and powers as an [[sanitary district|urban sanitary district]] and under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] Tyldesley-with-Shakerley became an [[urban district]] of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire, with an elected urban district council (UDC). What became Tyldesley Town Hall was originally the township's Liberal Club, opened in 1881, and was taken over by Tyldesley UDC as their headquarters in 1924. Actions of Tyldesley UDC included the opening of Tyldesley Park on Astley Street in 1902, the provision of the [[Carnegie Library]] in 1909, and council housing estates at Sale Lane, Mosley Common and Shakerley.<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 93.</ref>

In 1933, [[Lancashire County Council]] conducted a review of its political structure resulting in a reorganisation of districts in the county, with reference to the [[Local Government Act 1929]]. A new Tyldesley Urban District was formed by the amalgamation of Tyldesley with Shakerley Urban District and the parish of [[Astley, Greater Manchester|Astley]] from the abolished [[Leigh Rural District]].<ref>Youngs (1991), p. 689.</ref> The urban district was abolished in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], when the area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Local government in England and Wales: A Guide to the New System |year=1974 |publisher=[[HMSO]] |location=London |isbn=0-11-750847-0 |page=17}}</ref>

At {{coord|53|30|59|N|2|28|0|W|city}} (53.5166<U+00B0>, -2.4668<U+00B0>), and {{convert|170|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[central London]], Tyldesley is situated 7.7 miles (12.4&nbsp;km) east-southeast of Wigan and 8.9 miles (14.3&nbsp;km) west-northwest of the city of Manchester, and at the eastern end of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan. Topographically, Tyldesley is situated at the edge of the Lancashire Plain just to the north of [[Chat Moss]] and the Banks of Tyldesley are where the foothills of the Pennines begin. The land rises from about {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the foot of the banks to {{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the highest point. The banks are about one and a half miles long, they are an escarpment with the scarp slope facing south with the gentler dip to the north. The underlying rocks are largely coal measures covered with boulder clay. Streams drain the area including the Shakerley and Hindsford [[Stream|brooks]] which flow in to [[Glaze Brook]] a tributary of the [[River Mersey]].<ref name=vch/> Heavily industrialised during the 19th century, Tyldesley has become a residential area since the demise of the coal industry and closure of the cotton mills. The main road through Tyldesley is the A577 which runs along the ridge on which Tyldesley is situated.

The first section of tramway opened on 20&nbsp;October 1902 between [[Lowton]] and Four Lanes Ends via Leigh and Atherton and on 25&nbsp;October 1902 a branch from Atherton to Tyldesley was opened and Tyldesley got its first tram. This company got into financial difficulty and in turn became Lancashire United Tramways later [[Lancashire United Transport]]. In August 1931 trams were replaced by trolley buses.<ref name="Lunn p110">Lunn (1995), p. 110.</ref> Because of Tyldesley's narrow streets trams, and later trolley buses, had to follow a one-way system; eastbound trams ran along Shuttle Street and Milk Street and westbound trams used Elliot Street and Castle Street, a system now used by all traffic. Tyldesley is connected to neighbouring towns by bus services operated by [[South Lancs Travel]] of Atherton and [[First Manchester]].

== Religion ==
{{seealso|List of churches in Greater Manchester}}
[[File:Tyldesley Top Chapel.jpg|left|thumb|Tyldesley Top Chapel is a Grade II listed buildings facing the Market Square]]
Tyldesley's first place of worship, [[Tyldesley Top Chapel|Top Chapel]] was built in the Square in 1789<ref name="Lunn p65">Lunn (1995), p.65.</ref> for the [[Selina Hastings|Countess of Huntingdon]]'s sect which had broken away from the [[Church of England]].
[[John Wesley]] had preached in [[Shakerley]] laying the foundations for a place of worship in the area. Later in the 1780s [[George Whitfield]] who had worked with John Wesley earlier on in his ministry also preached in Shakerley. The local squire, Thomas Johnson, gifted land on the highest point of Tyldesley for a chapel and Lady Huntingdon, a supporter of John Wesley supplied money for the building materials. The chapel was completed in 1789 and became known as the Top Chapel due to its geographical location. The chapel has its own graveyard. <ref name="Lunn p65"/>

Before 1825 Tyldesley had no church, and for ecclesiastical purposes, lay within the ancient parish of [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]] in the [[Diocese of Chester]].<ref name="Lunn 73">Lunn (1995), p. 73.</ref>  This diocese divided in 1847, when the present [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester|Diocese of Manchester]] was created.<ref> Horn, Smith & Mussett (2004), pp. 117-118.</ref> For ritual [[baptism]]s, [[marriage]]s and [[burial]]s, the people of Tyldesley, had to travel to churches that lay outside of the township's boundaries, including Leigh Parish Church or its daughter churches at Astley St Stephen's or Atherton, St John the Baptist, Deane Parish Church or Eccles Parish Church.

The [[Parish Church of St George, Tyldesley]] a [[chapel of ease]] under the mother church of Leigh, St Mary's, was built in 1825 on land donated by Thomas Johnson. It was a [[Waterloo church]], paid for by money from the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]] raised by the Church Building Act 1818, and said to be a celebration of Britain's victory in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref name="Lunn 73"/> [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] was an official architect to the [[Office of Works]] and advised the Parliamentary Commissioners on the building of new churches from 1818 onwards, including St George, Tyldesley. The chapel was consecrated on 19 September 1825, dedicated to [[Saint George]].<ref name="Lunn 73"/>  The church could seat 1,100 people, it is {{convert|112|ft|m|0}} in length, {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} in width and its spire, a local landmark is {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} in height.<ref name="Lunn 73"/> George Ormerod gave the land for the churchyard and also six bells which were cast at [[Downham Market]], in [[Norfolk]].<ref>Lunn (1995), p. 74.</ref>

There are also chapels of the Congregational, Primitive Methodist, Wesleyan Methodist, Baptist, Welsh Congregational, Welsh Calvinistic, and Independent Methodist connexions.<ref name=vch/> The Welsh chapels served the many Welsh people who migrated to Tyldesley after the opening of the railway in 1864.<ref name="Tyldesley Town Centre Conservation Area Appraisal">{{Citation | title = Tyldesley Town Centre Conservation Area Appraisa| url = http://www.wigan.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/24F97B08-4321-4E66-A53D-876C3C24CB68/0/Tyldesleyfinaldraft1244kb.pdf  | format = PDF | page = p. 13 | publisher = wigan.gov.uk | accessdate = 2009-10-09 }}</ref>

==Sport==
===Tyldesley Swimming Club===
The idea for a public swimming baths came from [[Caleb Wright]]. The Local Board built Tyldesley Baths in Union Street at a cost of <U+00A3>1,300 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1300|1876|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} and they opened to great celebrations in 1876. Tyldesley Swimming Club was formed as soon as the Baths opened. The Union Street Baths closed on health grounds in 1960 and the old Majestic Cinema on Castle Street was converted into the present public baths in 1964.<ref>{{Citation | title = Tyldesley Swimming Club | url = http://www.tyldesleyswimming.co.uk/
