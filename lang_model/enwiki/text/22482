'''Severe Tropical Storm Halong''' (international designation: '''0804''', JTWC name: '''05W''', PAGASA name: '''Cosme''') was the fourth severe tropical storm named by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) who are the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] for the north western [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] also recognised Halong as the fifth tropical depression, the fourth tropical storm as well as the third typhoon of the [[2008 Pacific typhoon season]].

The name "Halong" was one of the 10 original names submitted by [[Vietnam]] to the [[WMO|WMO's]] Typhoon Committee for use from January 1, 2000. Halong was last used in the [[2002 Pacific typhoon season]] and is named after [[Halong Bay]], which is a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site in Vietnam. The [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) assigned the name Cosme to the tropical storm. Cosme was last used in the [[2004 Pacific typhoon season]] to name Sudal.

Later on May&nbsp;17 Halong made landfall on the Philippine region of [[Pangasinan]] and travelled towards the northeast over [[Luzon]].  Whilst over land Halong weakened in to a tropical storm with both the JTWC and the JMA downgrading Halong early the next day. <ref name="JTWC Best Track 04W"/> <ref name="JMA Halong BT"/> Later that day after reaching the [[Philippine Sea]], Halong started to re strengthen and intensified in to a severe tropical storm. <ref name="JMA Halong BT"/> However it did not intensify any further and on May&nbsp;19 weakened in to a tropical storm. <ref name="JMA Halong BT"/> Later on May&nbsp;19 PAGASA issued their final advisory on Halong as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC then issued their last advisory on Halong as it had began its extra tropical transition the JMA then reported that it had completed its extra tropical transition and issued their final advisory on the  remnant low of Halong. The remnants of Halong dissipated on May&nbsp;24. <ref name="JMA Halong BT"/>

==Preparations==
Starting May 15, PAGASA issued [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Philippines|Storm Warning Signals]] for various areas across the Philippines. At 1500 UTC that day Signal Number One was initially issued over northern [[Palawan]], [[Occidental Mindoro]] and [[Lubang Island]].<ref>http://www.webcitation.org/5XqH037NA</ref> At its maximum coverage (at 0930 UTC 17 May), Storm Signal Number 3 was issued for [[Zambales]], [[Pangasinan]], [[La Union]], [[Tarlac]], [[Benguet]] and [[Ilocos Sur]], Signal Number 2 was for [[Bataan]], [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Nueva Viscaya]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Quirino]], [[Ifugao]], [[Mt. Province]], [[Kalinga]], [[Abra Province|Abra]], [[Apayao]] and [[Ilocos Norte]] and Signal Number 1 was raised for [[Lubang Island]], [[Batangas]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna]], [[Rizal]], northern [[Quezon]], [[Isabela Province|Isabela]], [[Aurora Province|Aurora]], [[Cagayan]], [[Calayan Island]], [[Babuyan Group of Islands]], [[Batanes]] and [[Metro Manila]] <ref>http://www.webcitation.org/5Xsse18ID</ref> Further on as Cosme (Halong) razed through Northern Luzon, these storm signals were scaled back until the storm reached the [[Cagayan]]-[[Batanes]] area and the Pacific Ocean proper.<ref>http://www.webcitation.org/5Xut9j6Sd</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Manilagovt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the places in Luzon affected.]]
In Luzon, the Typhoon caused 58&nbsp;deaths and $94&nbsp;million (USD) in damage. The storm destroyed 43,365&nbsp;houses and damaged 188,830&nbsp;more. Most of the damages reported were in Northern [[Luzon]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.gmanews.tv/story/97339/Cosme-death-toll-reaches-58-damages-exceed-P4B |title = GMANews.TV - Cosme death toll reaches 58; damages exceed P4B - Nation - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News - BETA |accessdate = 2008-06-22}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Mindoro]] and [[Panay]] islands were also affected as the storm-induced southwest [[monsoon]] brought rains and floods to those areas. In particular, a ferry in Mindoro was stranded as Cosme (still a tropical depression that time) passed close enough to Mindoro Thursday night (May 15).<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95717/(Update)-Cosme-batters-parts-of-RP-300-stranded-ferry-passengers-safe</ref> The [[Subic]]-[[Olongapo]] area, one of the economic zones of the Philippines, experienced [[power outage]]s as the storm gets closer to Zambales on May 17.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95872/Blackout-hits-Olongapo-Subic-as-Cosme-nears</ref> The province of Pangasinan, where the storm made its landfall, experienced waist-high [[floods]] and power outages as well.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95908/Cosme-plunges-Pangasinan-into-darkness-warning-raised</ref> Even the city of [[Dagupan]] (in Pangasinan) suffered the same fate with even stranded persons all over the city due to flooding.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95910/(Update)-Cosme-reaches-Benguet-14-areas-under-storm-signal-3</ref> The town of [[Santa Cruz, Zambales|Sta. Cruz]] in Zambales had about 7,000 people homeless due to Cosme.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95938/Cosme-ravages-Zambales-town-7000-families-homeless</ref> Overall, the hardest hit were Pangasinan and Zambales provinces.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95943/Zambales-Pangasinan-worst-hit-by-Cosme---NDCC</ref> Because the damage caused by the storm in Zambales is extensive even in infrastracture, repair was forced to be done on schools there as that time, classes are to resume in the next few weeks.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/96730/DepEd-works-double-time-to-fix-Cosme-hit-Zambales-schools</ref> The storm also increased the prices of vegetables in Metro Manila, as the latter gets most of its vegetables from Northern Luzon.<ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/97120/Prices-of-veggies-increase-after-storm-Cosme</ref>

According to the final report on Cosme (Halong) released by the National Disaster Coordinating Council, 61 were reported killed, 33 wounded and three were left missing. People affected by Cosme numbered 1,496,635 persons in 1,510 barangays in five provinces. Damages to property totaled to PHP 4.712 billion, of PHP 3.721 billion were agricultural losses and PHP 992 million were destructed infrastructure.<ref name="Final Report on the Aftermath of Tropical Storm Cosme (Halong)">http://210.185.184.53/ndccWeb/images/ndccWeb/ndcc_update/TC_COSME/final%20report%20cosme.pdf</ref> Pangasinan was the most damaged province as indicated by the report.
