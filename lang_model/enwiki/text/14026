==Plot==
The episode opens with Ron ([[Nick Offerman]]) trying to tell Leslie ([[Amy Poehler]]) that somebody is on fire at a park saying, "Here's the situation", only to be interrupted by Leslie with her rendition of "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]" before he can fully explain.

Leslie has been doing a lot of promotions for the local Pawnee Zoo over the summer. This includes a birthday party for a parrot turning 60, a college graduation for some chimpanzees, and a marriage for two recently acquired penguins. After Leslie marries the two penguins, a man at the ceremony informs the kids and Leslie that both of the penguins are boys. Later, Leslie greets Mark ([[Paul Schneider]]) , they both clearly state for the cameras that they are only friends after the events of [[Rock Show (Parks and Recreation)|Rock Show]].

A gay bar in Pawnee, The Bulge, send Leslie a cake with two penguins on top to honor Leslie for her support of gay marriage. April ([[Aubrey Plaza]]), April's boyfriend Derek and Derek's boyfriend Ben, the latter two now regarding Leslie as a hero for her supposed stance on gay marriage want to take her to The Bulge the following night as a guest of honor at their party for her.

Marcia Langman, a member of the Society for Family Stability Foundation shows up wanting Leslie's resignation for her apparent stance on gay marriage, Leslie claims that she wasn't trying to make a stance, that she was only trying to do something cute by marrying the penguins. Ann ([[Rashida Jones]]) shows up and updates us that since Mark fell into the pit she's notices him being a lot nicer now and that she has broken up with Andy ([[Chris Pratt]]). According to Ann, Andy said he was going to [[Kansas]] to climb mountains. Mark tries to ask Ann out, but Ann declines in respect to her and Leslie's friendship.

Leslie goes to The Bulge with Tom ([[Aziz Ansari]]) to tell the gay supporters there that she wasn't trying to take a stance with the penguin marriage, but with all of them chanting her name and a couple of drinks in her, she gives in and agrees with them. The next day Leslie has to go on Pawnee Today, hosted by Joan Calimazzum ([[Mo Collins]]), to defend her supposed stance on television against Marcia Langman.

Meanwhile, Andy shows up at Ann's House. Andy tries to get back together with Ann claiming that he's changed a lot since they broke up. He wears a fancy suit and tells her he's gotten an office job. Ann tells him she doesn't want to get back together. Andy leaves Ann's house where the camera follows him, we find out he has been living in the pit.

Back on Pawnee Today Leslie and Marcia argue both of their points. Leslie proclaims that she will not be annulling the penguins' wedding, nor resign from her job. After that she visits Ann's house and tells her that it is okay with her if Ann wants to date Mark.

Leslie transfers the penguins to a zoo in [[Iowa]] where gay marriage is legal. She is shown literally driving the penguins there.

}}"Pawnee Zoo" received generally positive reviews. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writer [[James Poniewozik]] said the episode "beautifully" merged the political and personal and improved upon previous episodes by using and balancing its supporting characters. Poniewozik said, "'Pawnee Zoo' was spot-on, and had me cracking up beginning to end."<ref name="Time" /> Henning Fog of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said with "Pawnee Zoo", the series appeared to be finding its rhythm and starting to distinguish itself from its conceptual spinoff, ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', which was also created by ''Parks and Recreation'' co-creator [[Greg Daniels]]. Fog also said bringing real social issues into the show was a positive direction for the series.<ref name="EW" /> Emily Christianson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said "Pawnee Zoo" improves upon the first season by giving more attention to plot points outside the pit. Christianson also said he enjoyed the scenes with Leslie drunk in the bar, and said he liked the introduction of the Leslie and Mark romance.<ref name="LATimes" /> ''Los Angeles Times'' writer Jon Caramanica said the same-sex marriage subplot only alters thes how's dymanic "a smidge", and mainly serves as "another opportunity for misadventrue for Leslie Knope". Caramanica said Poehler is talented, but ill-suited for the goofy Leslie character.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |title="Parks and Recreation" and Amy Poehler |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-09-17 |location=[[Los Angeles]], [[California]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-monitor17-2009sep17,0,2687196.story |accessdate=2009=09-22}}</ref> 

Maureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said the episode appeared to be heading in a better direction than the first season, and said of Leslie, "You start to root for her this season, instead of wishing she would go away." She also praised the "Parent's Just Don't Understand" rap, comparing it to Poehler's acclaimed rap about the-vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] during a [[Saturday Night Live]] sketch.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |title=Comedy reigns on Thursdays |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2009-09-17 |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0917-parks-watchersep17,0,1293802.column |accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref> Matt Fowler of ''[[IGN]]'' said "Pawnee Zoo" was "more solidly entertaining" than the entire first season, and made a stronger effort to build up the supporting cast, particularly by establishing a romance between Jones and Schneider.

But Heisler said it "isn't the best thing on tonight".<ref name="AVClub" /> Not all reviews were positive. Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'' said he liked ''Parks and Recreation'', but found "Pawnee Zoo" to be "flat, forced and messagey", and did not make proper use of the supporting cast.
