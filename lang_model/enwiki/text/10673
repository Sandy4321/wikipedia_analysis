The '''A1''' is the longest numbered road in the UK at {{convert|410|mi}}. It connects [[Greater London|London]], the capital of England and the United Kingdom, with [[Edinburgh]], the capital of Scotland. It passes through and near [[Highgate]] and [[North London]], [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Stevenage]], [[Letchworth]], [[Peterborough]], [[Grantham]], [[Leeds]], [[York]], [[Gateshead]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].<ref>[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/f99/1.shtml Roadlists]{{Verify credibility|date=June 2011}}</ref>

It was designated by the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] in 1921, and for much of its route, it followed various branches of the '''Great North Road''', the main deviation being between [[Boroughbridge]] and [[Darlington]]. Since 1921, the course of the A1 has changed where towns or villages have been [[bypass (road)|bypassed]], or where new formations take a slightly different route. Several sections of the route have been upgraded to [[Motorway (United Kingdom)|motorway standard]] and numbered [[A1(M)]]. Between the [[M25 motorway|M25]] (near London) and [[A696 road|A696]] (near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]) the road is part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroute]] [[European route E15|E15]].

==Origins and history==
{{See also|Great Britain road numbering scheme|A1 road (London)}}

The modern A1 mainly follows the Great North Road coaching route used by [[mail coaches]] between London, [[York]] and Edinburgh. The many inns on the road, many of which still survive, were staging posts on the coach routes, providing accommodation, stabling for the horses and replacement mounts.<ref>Norman W. Webster (1974)'' The Great North Road''</ref>  However, virtually none of the surviving coaching inns can be seen while driving on the A1, because the modern route now bypasses the towns in which the inns are to be found.

A traditional starting point of the Great North Road was [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] in Central London. Distances on the road were computed from the now demolished [[Hicks Hall]], situated at the south end of [[St John Street, London|St John Street]], just to the north of Smithfield Market.<ref>Norman W. Webster (1974)'' The Great North Road'': 15<U+2013>16</ref> The route ran from Smithfield up St John Street to the [[Angel Islington]]. However, with the building of the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] at [[St Martin's-le-Grand]] in 1829, coaches started using an alternative route, used by the modern A1, beginning at the GPO building and following [[Aldersgate Street]] and [[Goswell Road]] before joining the old route at the Angel. The Angel was an important staging post on the route.<ref>Norman W. Webster (1974)'' The Great North Road'': 22<U+2013>23</ref> The next important stages were Highgate, Barnet, Hatfield, Baldock, Biggleswade and [[Alconbury]], all replete with traditional coaching inns.
[[File:Route A1.jpg|thumb|The A1 at South Mimms, Hertfordshire, approaching Junction 1 with the M25 and A1(M).]]
At Alconbury, the Great North Road joined the [[Old North Road]], an older route from London which follows the Roman [[Ermine Street]]. Here a milestone records mileages to London via both routes: 65 by the Old North Road and 68 by the Great North Road.<ref>Norman W. Webster (1974)'' The Great North Road'': 56-7</ref> From Alconbury the Great North Road follows the line of Ermine Street north, through [[Stilton]] and Stamford as far as [[Woolsthorpe by Colsterworth|Colsterworth]] (at the [[A151 road (England)|A151]] junction). Inns on this section include the George at Stamford and the Bell Inn at Stilton, the original sellers of [[Stilton (cheese)|Stilton]] cheese.

At Colsterworth the Great North Road diverges west of the Roman road and continues through Grantham, Newark, Retford and Bawtry to Doncaster. North of Doncaster the Great North Road again follows a short section of Ermine Street called [[Roman Ridge, South Yorkshire|Roman Rigg]] or [[Roman Ridge, South Yorkshire|Roman Ridge]]. Further north the Great North Road crossed the Roman [[Dere Street]] near [[Boroughbridge]] from where it went via [[Dishforth]] and [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]] to [[Northallerton]] and then through [[Darlington]] and [[Durham]].  A road forked off to the left at the bridge in Boroughbridge to follow Dere Street, thence from Scotch Corner to Penrith and on to Glasgow.  Part of this route was used for the original A1, with a local road from Scotch Corner via Barton to Darlington making the link back to the old Great North Road.

In the first era of [[stage coach]]es York was the terminus of the Great North Road, on the route Doncaster<U+2013>[[Selby]]<U+2013>York but was later superseded by the route Doncaster<U+2013>[[Ferrybridge]]<U+2013>Wetherby<U+2013>Boroughbridge<U+2013>Northallerton<U+2013>Darlington, the more direct way to Edinburgh, the ultimate destination. The first recorded stage coach operation running to York was in 1658. This took four days to reach its destination. Faster mail coaches began using the route in 1786, stimulating a quicker service from the other passenger coaches. In the 'Golden Age of Coaching', between 1815<U+2013>35 coaches could go from London to York in 20 hours and from London to Edinburgh in 45 and a half hours. In the mid nineteenth century coach services could not compete with the new railways. The last coach from London to Newcastle left in 1842 and the last from Newcastle to Edinburgh in July 1847.<ref>Norman W. Webster (1974)'' The Great North Road: 6<U+2013>9''</ref>

==Route==
{{See also|A1 road (London)}}
The A1 runs from the [[City of London]] at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] to the centre of Edinburgh. The road skirts the remains of [[Sherwood Forest]], and passes [[Catterick Garrison]]. It shares its London terminus with the [[A40 road|A40]], in the City area of [[Central London]]. It runs out of London through [[Islington]] (where [[A1 road (London)#Upper Street|Upper Street]] forms part of its route), up [[Holloway Road]], through [[Highgate]], [[Barnet]], [[Potters Bar]], [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Welwyn]], [[Stevenage]], [[Baldock]], [[Biggleswade]], [[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]], [[St Neots]].

Continuing north, the A1 runs on modern bypasses around [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[Grantham]], [[Newark-on-Trent]], [[Retford]], [[Bawtry]], [[Doncaster]], [[Knottingley]], [[Garforth]], [[Wetherby]], [[Knaresborough]], [[Boroughbridge]], [[Scotch Corner]], [[Darlington]], [[Newton Aycliffe]], [[Durham]], [[Chester-le-Street]], past the [[Angel of the North]] sculpture and the [[MetroCentre (shopping centre)|Metrocentre]] in [[Gateshead]], through the western suburbs of  [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], [[Alnwick]], [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], into Scotland, past [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] and [[Musselburgh]] before finally arriving in Edinburgh at the East End of [[Princes Street]] near [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley Station]] at the junction of the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]], [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8]] and [[A900 road (Great Britain)|A900]] roads.

[[Scotch Corner]], in North Yorkshire, marks the point where the traffic for [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland divides from that for Edinburgh. As well as a hotel there have been a variety of homes for the transport caf<U+00E9>, now subsumed as a motorway services. 

==Overview and post-First World War developments==
Most of the English section of the A1 is a series of alternating sections of [[dual carriageway]] and motorway.  From Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Edinburgh it is a trunk road with alternating sections of dual and single carriageway. The table below summaries the road as motorways and non-motorways sections,<ref>The table was drawn up by reading values from the AA Route Planner for the journey Bank of England, London to Waverley Station, Edinburgh via Wittering.  Adjustments were made for sections of the route that were not part of the A1.{{cite web

The original A1 was designated by the [[Department for Transport |Ministry of Transport]] in 1921. The route was modified in 1927 when bypasses were built around [[Barnet]] and [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]]. In the 1930s by-passes where added in [[Chester-le-Street]], [[Durham]] and the [[Ferryhill]] Cut was dug. In 1960 Stamford and Doncaster were bypassed, as was [[Retford]] in 1961 and [[St Neots]] in 1971.

During the early 1970s plans to widen the A1 along the [[A1_road_(London)#Archway_Road|Archway Road section]] were abandoned after considerable opposition and four public inquiries during which [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|road protesters]] disrupted proceedings.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hyg-AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=archway+road+inquiry&source=bl&ots=B6_AZ6hKAO&sig=2BWjR3iEXSh-jCrKsi0m39TcP_M&hl=en&ei=zHzmSuikEMqZjAfi4b2hBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CCcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=archway%20road&f=false|title=Transport planning, vision and practice}}</ref> The scheme was finally dropped in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadblock.org.uk/resources/roadsvictories.pdf|title=Road Victories|format=PDF|work=Road Block|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

A proposal to upgrade the whole of the A1 to motorway status was investigated by the government in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/14/a1-motorway-status|title=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/14/a1-motorway-status|publisher=Hansard}}</ref> but was then dropped in 1995 along with many other schemes in response to [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|road protests]] associated with other road schemes (including the [[Newbury Bypass]] and the M3 extension through [[Twyford Down]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=a1%20baldock&ALL=a1%20baldock&ANY=&PHRASE=&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=51220w05.html_spnew6&URL=/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo951220/text/51220w05.htm#51220w05.html_spnew6 |publisher=Hansard|date=1995-12-20|title=Column: 1180|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>
[[File:A1scotland.jpg|thumb|right|A single carriageway section of the A1 skirting the Scottish coastline just across the border from Northumberland.]]

A {{convert|13|mi}} section of the road from Walshford to Dishforth was upgraded to motorway standard which opened in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/a1mwaldish.htm|title=A1(M). Walshford to Dishforth|accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref> Neolithic remains and a Roman fort were discovered.

A {{convert|21|km}} section of the road from Alconbury to Peterborough was upgraded to motorway standard at a cost of <U+00A3>128&nbsp;million (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|128000000|1998|2011|r=-1}}}} as of 2011),{{Inflation-fn|UK}}which opened in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4442.aspx|title=A1(M) Alconbury to Peterborough|publisher=Highways Agency}}</ref> requiring the moving the memorial to Napoleonic prisoners buried at [[Norman Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lhi.org.uk/projects_directory/projects_by_region/east_of_england/city_of_peterborough/norman_cross_eagle_appeal/index.html

A number of sections from the Scottish border to Edinburgh were dualed between 1999 and 2004, including a 3&nbsp;km section from Spott Wood to Oswald Dean in 1999, 2&nbsp;km sections from Bowerhouse to Spott Road and from Howburn to Houndwood in 2002<U+2013>2003 and the 13.7&nbsp;km "A1 Expressway", from [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] and [[Dunbar]] in 2004. The total cost of these works was some <U+00A3>50&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2004/04/5377|title=A1 expressway opened}}</ref>

Plans to dual the [[single carriageway]] section of road north of Newcastle upon Tyne were shelved in 2006 as they were not considered a regional priority by central government. The intention was to dual the road between [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] and [[Felton, Northumberland|Felton]] and between [[Adderstone]] and [[Belford, Northumberland|Belford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northumberlandtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1117&ArticleID=1625204|title=Northumberland Today <U+2013> ''A1 dualling hopes dashed''|date=2006-07-13|publisher=Northumberland Today|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>

In 1999 a section of A1(M) between Bramham and Hook Moor opened to traffic along with the extension of the M1 from [[Leeds]].
The southern terminus was at an arbitrary point near [[Micklefield]] as opposed to a junction.<ref>[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/media/photo/gallery11.shtml]</ref> Under a [[Shadow Toll|DBFO]] contract,<ref name="DBFO">{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5541.aspx|title=Darrington to Dishforth|publisher=Highways Agency|pages=1|accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref>  sections from Wetherby to Walshford and Darrington to Hook Moor were opened in 2005 and 2006, taking the section to a junction.

==Recent developments==
===A1 Peterborough to Blyth grade separated junctions===
Between August 2006 and September 2009 the six roundabouts on the A1 between [[Blyth, Nottinghamshire|Blyth]] and the A1(M) section to Alconbury were replaced with grade-separated junctions. These provide a fully grade separated route between the Buckden roundabout (just north of St Neots and approximately {{convert|4|mi}} north of the Black Cat roundabout) and just north of [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4455.aspx|title=A1 Peterborough to Blyth Grade Separated Junctions Scheme|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> This project  cost <U+00A3>96&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/campaigns/climate_change/roads/pricetag|title=Bigger and bigger pricetag}}.</ref>

===A1(M) Bramham to Wetherby motorway===
Upgrade of {{convert|6.2|mi|km}} of road to dual 3-lane motorway standard between the Bramham/[[A64 road|A64]] junction to north of Wetherby to meet the section of motorway at a cost of <U+00A3>70&nbsp;million began in 2006, including a road alongside for non-motorway traffic. The scheme's [[public inquiry]] began on 18 October 2006 and the project was designed by James Poyner. Work began in May 2007, the motorway section opened in July 2009 and remaining work on side roads was still ongoing in late August and is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5526.aspx|title=A1(M) Bramham to Wetherby Improvement Scheme|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>

==Current improvements==
===A1(M) Dishforth to Leeming motorway===
Upgrade of the existing dual carriageway to dual 3-lane motorway standard, with a local road alongside for non-motorway traffic, between [[Dishforth]] (A1(M)/[[A168 road|A168]] junction) and [[Leeming Bar]], began in March 2009 and is expected to be completed by Summer 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5187.aspx|title=A1 Dishforth to Barton Improvement Scheme|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref> It had originally been proposed that the motorway would be upgraded as far as [[Barton]] (between [[Scotch Corner]] and [[Darlington]]), which is the start of current northernmost section of A1(M). However this second phase was cancelled as part of government spending cuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2010/10/21/details-emerge-of-dumped-road-schemes/|title=Details emerge of dumped road schemes|publisher=Construction Enquirer|accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> If this second stage had been implemented, this would have provided continuous motorway standard between Darrington (south of M62 junction) and [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], and would have provided the North East and North Yorkshire with full motorway access to London (via [[M62 motorway|M62]], [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]] and [[M1 motorway|M1]]).

==Legend and popular culture==
''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'' are characters in an English story adapted to the stage in 1605 which since the 19th century has become one of the most popular pantomime subjects, very loosely based on the historical [[Richard Whittington]], a medieval [[Lord Mayor of London]]. Dick, a boy from a poor family in [[Gloucestershire]], walks to London to make his fortune, accompanied by his cat. He meets with little success there. Discouraged, as Dick and Cat are making for home by way of [[Highgate Hill]], they hear the [[Bow Bells]] from distant London; Dick believes they are sending him a message to "turn again" <U+2013> and that he will become Lord Mayor of London.  They return: Dick makes his fortune and indeed becomes Lord Mayor. A large hospital on Highgate Hill is named after the story, and a statue of Dick's faithful pet stands nearby.

The [[highwayman]] [[Dick Turpin]]'s flight from London to York in less than 15 hours on his mare Black Bess is the most famous legend of the Great North Road. Various inns along the A1 claim Turpin ate lunch there that night, or stopped for a respite for his horse. [[Harrison Ainsworth]], in his 1834 romance ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'', immortalised this with a spirited account of this ride. Historians argue that Turpin never made the journey, claiming instead that the ride was by [[John Nevison]], known as "Swift Nick", born and raised at Wortley near Sheffield and a highwayman in the time of Charles II, 50 years before Turpin. It is claimed that Nevison, in order to establish an alibi, rode from Gad's Hill, near [[Rochester, Kent]], to York (some {{convert|190|mi}}) in 15 hours.

The ''Winchelsea Arms'' was an inn on a long straight section of the Great North Road near [[Stretton, Rutland|Stretton]] which was reputed to be another haunt of Dick Turpin.  It is now called the ''Ram Jam Inn'' after a story from those coaching days.  A coach passenger undertook to show the landlady the secret of drawing both mild and bitter beer from the same barrel.  Two holes were made and she was left with one thumb rammed against one and the other jammed into the other.  The trickster then made off.<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=73-BMaBm-ooC&pg=PA118 |title=Introduction to Inn Signs |author=Eric R. Delderfield}}</ref>

In literature the Great North Road features in ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]]. Part of the [[J.B. Priestley]] novel ''[[The Good Companions]]'' features the Great North Road; represented to the northerner Jess Oakroyd as the gateway to such exotic destinations as [[Nottingham]]. The [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] short story "The Fantastic Horror of the Cat in the Bag" by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] features a motorcycle chase along the Great North Road.  Similarly, Ruined City by [[Nevil Shute]] features an all night drive from Henry Warren's house in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, along the Great North Road as far as Rowley and then up to Greenhead near Hadrian's Wall, where Warren is dropped off to go walking.  His chauffeur, keen to get home for a date with the maid, is killed near Retford.

The A1 and Great North Road are also celebrated in song. The A1 is mentioned by [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] on the title track of the album ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' "Up on the A1 by Scotch Corner". "Scotch Corner," by the Welsh band [[Man (band)|Man]], on the album ''[[Rhinos, Winos, and Lunatics]]'' is about an encounter there. Near the southern end, signs saying "[[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and the North" inspired the eponymous 1970s rock band [[Hatfield and the North]]. The A1 is mentioned in The Long Blondes' song, "Separated By Motorways", along with the A14. The A1(M) is mentioned in the song "Gabadon" by [[Sheffield]] band, [[Haze (band)|Haze]], and the 'Great North Road' is mentioned in [[Mark Knopfler]]'s song, "5:15 AM", from the album ''[[Shangri-La (Knopfler album)|Shangri La]]''.

Some sections of the A1 have been upgraded to [[motorway]] standard. These are known as the A1(M) and are part of [[European route E15]]. These include:

;M25 to Stotfold

The M25 to Stotfold section is 23 miles (37 km), and was constructed between 1962 and 1986. The main destinations are Hatfield, Welwyn Garden City, Stevenage, and Letchworth  It opened in five stages: Junctions 1 to 2 opened in 1979; Junctions 2 to 4 opened in 1986; Junctions 4 to 6 opened in 1973; Junctions 6 to 8 opened in 1962; and Junctions 8 to 10 opened in 1967.

;Alconbury to Peterborough

The Alconbury to Peterborough section is 14 miles (22.5 km), and opened in 1998. 

;Doncaster bypass

The Doncaster bypass opened in 1961 and is one of the oldest sections of motorway in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/stats.htm |title=The Motorway Archive. Oldest, widest, longest, highest. |work=ciht.org.uk |year=2008 [last update] |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> It is 15 miles (24.1 km) long, and runs from [[Blyth]] to [[Carcroft]].

;Darrington to Dishforth

The Darrington to Dishforth section was constructed between 1995 and 2009. It is 34 miles (55 km), and opened in sections: 
*Walshford to 49 opened in 1995
*Junctions 43 to 44 opened in 1999
:When this section opened it ended at a temporary terminus south of the [[M1 motorway|M1]]. There was a final exit into Micklefield Village for non-motorway traffic onto what is now the access road. During the first week of June 2009, Junctions 44 and 45 were renumbered to 43 and 44.  At the same time the existing A1/A659 Grange Moor junction became A1(M) Junction 45.<ref>{{cite web

*Junction 46 to temporary junction at [[Walshford]] opened in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5523.aspx|title=A1(M) Wetherby to Walshford|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref>
*Junction 40 to south of 43 opened in 2005 & 2006
:The northern section of the upgrade, bypassing [[Fairburn, North Yorkshire|Fairburn]] village opened to traffic in April 2005 with a temporary connection with the existing A1 between Fairburn and [[Brotherton]]. The southern section, with a free-flow interchange with the [[M62 motorway]] opened to traffic on 13 January 2006.
*Junctions 44 to 46 opened in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5526.aspx|title=A1(M) Bramham to Wetherby|publisher=Highways Agency|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref>

;Dishforth to Leeming

Work began in March 2009 to upgrade the Dishforth to Leeming section to dual 3-lane motorway standard with existing connections being replaced by two new junctions. As of July 2010, work was in progress on the Dishforth to Leeming section (J49 to J51) with an estimated completion date in 2012.<ref>{{cite web
