'''Pau Claris i Casademunt''' (1 January in 1586 -  February 27 in 1641) was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] lawyer and canonist and [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|94th President of Catalonia]] at the beginning of the [[Catalan Revolt]]. On January 16, 1641 he proclaimed the [[Catalan Republic]] under the protection of [[France]]. He was born in [[Barcelona]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
His paternal family was from [[Berga]], and both his grandfather, Francesc, and his father, Joan, were prominent [[jurist|jurists]] in Barcelona. His mother was Peronella Casademunt. Pau was the youngest of four brothers, and his older brother, Francesc (most likely named for his grandfather), was a lawyer and had a strong influence on his brother's path toward politics. Pau Claris' family belonged to the Barcelonese [[bourgeois]] and had significant economic and administrative power.

While it is possible that his education may have been more extensive, it is only clear that Claris received a doctorate in [[Civil law (area)|civil law]] and [[canon law]] in the [[University of Barcelona]].

On August 28, 1612, Pau Claris was appointed to work in [[La Seu d'Urgell]], the seat of the Bishop of Catalonia. On September 25 of the same year, he was appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Diocese of Urgell]].

===Political career===
In 1626, Claris was elected as a representative of the  church at the [[Corts Catalanes|the Catalan Parliament]], which opened on March 28 amid a troublesome  political situation after the new  king  of Spain, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], would not ratify the [[Catalan constitutions]], due to tax reasons and the question if royal officers had to follow the  [[Catalan law]]. The Catalan church had been exhausted by the royal taxes and was against the practice of nominating bishops from Castile to Catalan dioceses. The refuse to pay a tax of 3,300,000 [[Duchy (currency)|duchies]], caused the immediate departure of the king to [[Madrid]].

In 1632, Claris was appointed by his arm to discuss the insaculaci<U+00F3> and July 15 The [[classes]] nominated eighteen people it [[eighteenth]] - that exercise the real role of [[Executive Board]].

The most remarkable political episode of this period of life of Claris were the [[Vic riots]]. Following a [[lease]] [[potato]] the King of Spain to the establishment of a [[decimal]] on the incomes of the [[clergy|Church]] in [[Spain]], which serve as a subsidy to the crown, popular unrest erupts in the [[Diocese of Vic]] with virulence, under the guidance of the [[archdeacon]] Vigat<U+00E0> Dr. [[Melcior Palau]] and the passionate support of two canons of Urgell: Jaume Ferran and Pau Claris. The kidnapping of Vic ecclesiastical property by the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]], led by revolutionary events [[libel]] s threats and defamatory [[subversion]] to the field during spring and summer of 1634. Despite pressure from the [[bishop of Girona]], the [[Council of Aragon]] only dared to imprison a dissident deacon, [[Pau Capfort]]. Finally, the conflict s'apaivag<U+00E0> by way of delaying payment of the tenth until November.

Claris attended, years 1630 and 1636 by [[Council]]{{dn}}s Ecclesiastical Provincial of Tarragona. In the year 1636, despite the efforts of neutralizing the [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], Spanish [[Justino Antol<U+00ED>nez]], achieved approved a provision by which all the sermons in [[Principality]] be in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

===The president of the Government===
The July 22 in 1638, Pau Claris cleric was elected to form the [[Provincial]]. The other members were elected with clear: Jaume Ferran (also canon of Urgell), [[Rafael Antic]] and [[Rafael Cerd<U+00E0>]] as [[listener account|listener]] s of the ecclesiastical arm, and Royal Military respectively, and [[Francesc Tamarit]] and [[Josep Miquel Quintana]] as members of the Royal Arms and Military.

As a member church, Claris went on to preside over meetings of the Government. According to Elliott, the Viceroy in Santa Coloma tried in vain [[bribe]] of Claris and Tamarit, people uncomfortable for their role in the service of the king.

Claris Government met with a grave economic problems, the result of many years of mismanagement and conflict that opened with the Spanish Crown concerning the prosecution of [[smuggling]] said that the Government due to rating breach of the edicts of the year 1635 and 1638, which prohibits any kind of trade with [[France]] due to [[Thirty Years' War]]. The intervention of the [[sheriff]] [[Montrod<U+00F3>n]] commissioned by the Viceroy Santa Coloma stores [[Matar<U+00F3>]] and [[Salses]], triggering the conflict, in which the lawyer again [[Joan Pere Fontanella]] plays a prominent role in favor of the theses of the Members of the Government. Although the city of Barcelona She was initially reluctant to have ended next to the Members of the 1639, especially the decision of the Crown to establish a general recovery in Catalonia for the years 1639 and 1640, 50,000 [[pound (currency)|self]] s annually.

Last recaptatori this new effort was the will of [[private]] by [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]], add all the lands of the Crown Spanish effort to contribute financially to the expenses incurred in [[Thirty Years' War]] and had already devastated [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Catalonia had never heard aa own this conflict, root expansion and that the Catalans had never expected anything. Olivares, to counteract this situation, it wanted to move the conflict (or at least, as seemed good) and so on July 19 of 1639, the French [[Siege of Salses (1649)|besieged and took]] The [[Salses Castle]], the [[Roussillon]]. Then began a severe struggle between the Conde Duque and the Government to increase its efforts in the war. Finally, Members agreed to send [[Francesc Tamarit]] in front of a new [[removed]] soldiers of the [[Siege of Salses (1640)|restore the castle]] of salses, which achieved the [[Epiphany]] of 1640. However, the cost in lives and money for the country was so great that the situation became explosive.

===The Revolt===
Although the start date of contacts with France, ending with the formation of a Catalan-French alliance in opposition to the Spanish Crown and that would give rise to the so-called [[Catalan Revolt]] or War of the separation of Catalonia remains a controversial issue among historians, it seems that may have begun in May of 1640. Pau Claris had convened the general court on September 10 of 1640, but in parallel and without consulting the cities had started contacts with the French.

The September 7 of 1640, representatives of the Catalan, [[Francis Tamarit]] [[Ramon Guimer<U+00E0>]] and [[Francesc Vilaplana]], nephew of Claris, signed a first [[Covenant Ceret]] with [[Bernard Du Plessis-Besan<U+00E7>on]] representing the [[Cardinal Richelieu|Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu]] (''the Cardinal Richelieu'') on behalf of [[Louis XIII]], which Catalonia had receive military support aimed at tackling the Castilian offensive herd by Count-Duke of Olivares who had decided to intervene in Catalonia. It is believed that before the Spanish military pressure, Clara saw progressively driven to accept a counter-chorus to French pressure which Catalonia would separate itself from the Hispanic Monarchy and would take the form to [[Catalan Republic|Free Republic]] under the protection the French king.

The assumption of power by Claris staff since September 1640, appears to be total. The [[Junta General de Bra<U+00E7>os]] call a general meeting, which set itself as the institution of the new situation, officially the commitments by France and the [[secession]] and issued debt to finance military expenditures.

The October 20 of 1640 went to Barcelona and Du Plessis Besan<U+00E7>on, a few days later, he signed the first pact Confraternit<U+00E4>t and military aid from France to Catalonia, by which France undertook to defend the principle.

===Catalonian Republic===
On November 24 a Spanish army under [[Pedro Fajardo de Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga y Requesens|Marquis of Los V<U+00E9>lez]] invaded Catalonia from the south. On 23 December, Pau Claris declared  war against Philip IV of Spain. The victorious advance of the Castilian troops to Tortosa [[Battle of Cambrils|Cambrils]] [[Tarragona]] and [[Battle of Martorell|Martorell]] forced the [[Board of arms]] and [[Consell de Cent]] cedissin to French pressure and the January 16 and the Junta General de Bra<U+00E7>os [[January 17|17]] the Council accepted the proposal form in Catalonia republic under the protection of France.

But again the pressure of the Castilians who approached in Barcelona and the French claim to have led to Claris to liquidate the republican project and having to proclaim Louis XIII, Count of Barcelona January 23 in [[1641]], three days before the [[Battle of Montju<U+00EF>c (1641)|Battle of Montju<U+00EF>c]], who defeated miserably Castilian forces halted the attack in Barcelona January 26 of 1641.

On February 20, 1641, came to Barcelona [[Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt]], substitute Du Plessis, with powers of Captain General of all the armies fighting in Catalonia. That same day, Claris fell seriously ill and the day after receiving the [[last rites]].

Ferrer died at Pau Claris and 3rd quarter of 12 the night February 27 in 1641. In spite of the fact it was at least a year had health problems, the theory of a possible poisoning circulated from the first moment (the letter [[Roger de Bossost|Baron of Espenan]] in Du Plessis) and modern investigations support this possibility. 

Claris was placed in the glass of the family chapel of Christ Church of Sant Joan de Jerusalem in Barcelona. Unfortunately, the 1888 in the context of reforms to the [[Universal Exposition of Barcelona (1888)|Barcelona Universal Exhibition]] and a Catalonia enslaved by centuries of domination and repression of their own history, the church was demolished and the remains were lost forever.
