The '''Ciani EC 38/56 Urendo''', or '''SSVV EC 38/56 Urendo''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[tandem]] seat [[training aircraft|training]] [[glider (sailplane)|glider]] from the 1950s.  Four were built, one winning the Italian National Championships in 1959. Another, restored, still flies.

==Design and development==
Like his other designs, Edgardo Ciani's Urendo was built by Sezioni Sperimentale di Volo a Vela (SSVV) of [[Milan]],<ref name=SSVV/> an off-shoot of the Aeroclub Volovelistio Milanese.  It was intended as a general purpose (including training), low cost aircraft and the necessary simplicity of its construction was apparent in its flat sided [[fuselage]].<ref name=OSTIV2/><ref name=IVS/> It is said that when Ciani saw it in the air for the first time, he exclaimed "Ma l'<U+00E9> propri Urend!" ("By God, it's really horrible!" in the Milanese dialect) and named it Urendo (horrendous).<ref name=IVS/> Nonetheless, it has an efficient [[laminar flow]] wing and though its soaring is limited with two aboard by a high [[wing loading]], it flies well cross-country as a single seater.<ref name=OSTIV2/><ref name=SimonsII/>

The flying surfaces of the Urendo are almost entirely wooden, apart from [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covered]] rear control surfaces and [[fibre-glass]] [[aileron]] nose-caps.  Its [[monoplane#Types of monoplane|high set wing]], mounted with 3.50<U+00B0> of [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], is built around a single [[spar (aviation)|spar]] and [[plywood]] skinned. In plan the wing is straight edged, with an inner panel of constant [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] and 4.50<U+00B0> of forward sweep at quarter chord, and outer, tapered panels with forward sweep of 3<U+00B0>, terminating in small, [[streamline]]d bodies known as salmons.  The three Urendo variants were distinguished by the details of the ailerons on the outer panels, the [[air brake (aircraft)|airbrakes]], also on the outer panels but at their inboard limit, and the presence or absence of centre section [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]].<ref name=OSTIV2/> 

The Urendo's fuselage is steel framed and fabric covered.<ref name=SSVV/>  Behind the wings it has a [[kite (geometry)|kite shaped]] cross-section, the longer sides reaching down to the keel.  The tail surfaces are straight edged, with a parallel chord [[tailplane]] and [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] mounted forward of the [[fin]] and on top of the fuselage. The [[fin]] and [[rudder]] are straight tapered with a squared off top, the latter extending down to the keel.<ref name=SimonsII/> Forward, the fuselage section becomes [[hexagonal]] and deeper, with the [[tandem]] seats under a starboard side hinged, long, flat sided, flat topped and multi-part [[canopy  (aircraft)|canopy]].  This hinged part ends at the wing leading edge but fixed glazing carries the canopy back further, where it merges into the dorsal fuselage.<ref name=SSVV/>  The Urendo lands on a fixed, semi-recessed [[undercarriage#Gliders|monowheel]], fitted with a brake and placed towards the rear of a substantial, rubber mounted curved main skid. There is a small tail skid.<ref name=OSTIV2/> 

The Urendo flew for the first time on 22 June 1956.<ref name=OSTIV2/>

==Operational history==

Four Urendos were built, one without flaps and the other three as types B and C.<ref name=SSVV/>  It was agreed that each modification of the ailerons provided an improvement in control.<ref name=OSTIV2/>  Opinion differed on the effectiveness of the flaps,<ref name=SSVV/> intended to help with take-offs and improve thermalling performance.<ref name=OSTIV2/> The airbrakes were generally seen as very effective, providing landing descent rates of 6-7&nbsp;m/s (20-23 ft/s).<ref name=SSVV/>

Unexpectedly, a Urendo flown solo won the Italian National Gliding Championships in 1959, achieving the longest distance cross country flight there of 297&nbsp;km (185&nbsp;mi).<ref name=SimonsII/>  It returned good performances in several other national competitions.<ref name=SSVV/> 

''I-AVMI'', a type B Urendo, was quite recently discovered stored on an Italian farm and returned to the air.<ref name=SSVV/>

==Variants==
;Type A: Airbrakes mounted close to [[trailing edge]]. No flaps. Ailerons with upper surface hinges.
;Type B: Airbrakes further forward.  Slotted flaps with deflections between +5<U+00B0> and -50<U+00B0>. Ailerons as type A but slightly lengthened (11%) and hinges sealed.
;Type C: Airbrakes further forward still, near mid-chord.  Flaps as type B. Ailerons as type A, lengthened but with lower surface shrouds.

==Specifications (Type A)==
