The exact nature of Sino-Tibetan relations during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368<U+2013>1644) of [[China]] is unclear. Some modern scholars living and working in the [[People's Republic of China]] assert that the Ming Dynasty had unquestioned [[sovereignty]] over [[Tibet]], pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within the PRC also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century, thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside the PRC say that the relationship was one of [[suzerainty]], that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|simply paid tribute]] until the [[Jiajing Emperor|reign of Jiajing]] (1521<U+2013>1566), who ceased relations with Tibet. 

Some scholars note that Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in [[civil war]] and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as [[Nepal]]. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming Dynasty's shortage of [[horses in warfare|horses for warfare]] and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant [[Chinese Buddhism|religious nature]] of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan [[lama]]s is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier [[Mongols|Mongol]] leader [[Kublai Khan]] (r.&nbsp;1260&ndash;1294) and his spiritual superior [[Drog<U+00F6>n Ch<U+00F6>gyal Phagpa]] (1235&ndash;1280) of the Tibetan [[Sakya|Sakya sect]], the Ming Chinese [[Yongle Emperor]] (r.&nbsp;1402&ndash;1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with [[Deshin Shekpa]] (1384&ndash;1415), the [[Karmapa]] of the Tibetan [[Karma Kagyu|Black Hat sect]]. However, Yongle's attempts were unsuccessful.  

The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century, but did not garrison permanent troops there. At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays. The [[Wanli Emperor]] (r.&nbsp;1572<U+2013>1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the [[History of Tibet#The origin of the title of 'Dalai Lama'|Mongol-Tibetan alliance]] initiated in 1578, which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644<U+2013>1912) of China in their support for the [[Dalai Lama]] of the [[Gelug|Yellow Hat sect]]. By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama, after increasing their presence in the [[Amdo]] region. This culminated in [[G<U+00FC>shi Khan]]'s (1582&ndash;1655) conquest of Tibet from 1637&ndash;1642.

[[Tibet]] was once a strong power contemporaneous with the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&ndash;907).

Since 1236, the Mongol prince [[Kublai Khan|Kublai]] (who later ruled as [[Khagan]] from 1260&ndash;1294) was granted a large appanage in [[Northern and southern China|North China]] by his superior <U+00D6>gedei Khan.<ref name="rossabi 14 41">Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 14&ndash;41.</ref> [[Karma Pakshi]] (1203&ndash;1283)<U+2014>the head [[lama]] and second [[Karmapa]] of the Tibetan [[Karma Kagyu|Black Hat]] sect<U+2014>rejected the invitation of Kublai to appear in his court, so instead Kublai invited [[Drog<U+00F6>n Ch<U+00F6>gyal Phagpa]] (1235&ndash;1280), successor and nephew of Sakya Pandita, who came to his court in 1253.<ref name="rossabi 40 41">Rossabi, ''Khubilai Khan'', 40&ndash;41.</ref><ref name="patterson 88">George N.

Kublai Khan did not [[History of the Song Dynasty#Mongol invasion and end of the Song Dynasty|conquer the Song Dynasty]] of China until 1279, so Tibet was a component of the early Mongol Empire before it was combined into a larger empire with the whole of China under the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279&ndash;1368).<ref name="van praag 6"/> Van Praag writes that this conquest "marked the end of independent China," which was then incorporated into the Mongol Empire that stretched from China, Tibet, [[Mongolia]], parts of [[Korea]], [[Siberia]], and [[Annam]], and Upper [[Burma]].<ref name="van praag 6 7">Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 6&ndash;7.</ref>

The Ming court appointed three Princes of Dharma (<U+6CD5><U+738B>) and five Princes (<U+738B>), and granted many other titles, such as Grand State Tutors (<U+5927><U+570B><U+5E2B>) and State Tutors (<U+570B><U+5E2B>), to the important schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including the [[Karma Kagyu|Karma Kagyu sect]], [[Sakya|Sakya sect]], and [[Gelug|Gelug sect]].<ref>''[[Mingshi]]''-Western territory III <U+00AB><U+660E><U+53F2><U+2022><U+5217><U+50B3><U+7B2C><U+4E8C><U+767E><U+5341><U+4E03><U+897F><U+57DF><U+4E09><U+00BB></ref> According to Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, leading officials of these organs were all appointed by the central government and were subject to the rule of law.<ref name="wang nyima 38"/> Yet Van Praag describes the distinct and long-lasting Tibetan law code established by the Phagmodru ruler Janchub Gyalts<U+00E4>n as one of many reforms to revive old Imperial Tibetan traditions.<ref name="van praag 7"/>

===Inheritance, reappointments, and titles===
====Transition from Yuan to Ming====
Historians disagree on what the relationship was between the Ming court and Tibet and whether or not Ming China had sovereignty over Tibet.

Wang and Nyima argue that the Ming emperor sent edicts to Tibet twice in the second year of the Ming Dynasty, and demonstrated that he viewed Tibet as a significant region to pacify by urging various Tibetan tribes to submit to the authority of the Ming court.<ref name="Wang nyima 31">Wang & Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 31.</ref> They note that at the same time, the Mongol Prince Punala, who had inherited his position as ruler of areas of Tibet, went to Nanjing in 1371 to pay tribute and show his allegiance to the Ming court, bringing with him the seal of authority issued by the Yuan court.<ref name="wang nyima 32">Wang & Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 32.</ref> They also state that since successors of lamas granted the title of "prince" had to travel to the Ming court to renew this title, and since lamas called themselves princes, the Ming court therefore had "full sovereignty over Tibet."<ref name="wang nyima 37">Wang & Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 37.</ref> They state that the Ming Dynasty, by issuing imperial edicts to invite ex-Yuan officials to the court for official positions in the early years of its founding, won submission from ex-Yuan religious and administrative leaders in the Tibetan areas, and thereby incorporated Tibetan areas into the rule of the Ming court.

Journalist and author Thomas Laird, in his book ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', writes that Wang and Nyima present the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government viewpoint of the People's Republic of China]] in their ''Historical Status of China's Tibet'', and fail to realize that China was "absorbed into a larger, non-Chinese political unit" during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, which Wang and Nyima paint as a characteristic Chinese dynasty succeeded by the Ming.<ref name="laird 106 107">Thomas Laird, ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'' (New York: Grove Press, 2006), 106&ndash;107.</ref> Laird asserts that the ruling Mongol khans never administered Tibet as part of China and instead ruled them as separate territories, comparing the Mongols with the British who colonized India and New Zealand, yet stating this does not make India part of New Zealand as a consequence.<ref name="laird 107">Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 107.</ref> Of later Mongol and Tibetan accounts interpreting the Mongol conquest of Tibet, Laird asserts that "they, like all non-Chinese historical narratives, never portray the Mongol subjugation of Tibet as a Chinese one."<ref name="laird 107"/> John Powers, in his book ''History as propaganda: Tibetan exiles versus the People's Republic of China'', states that:<ref name="powers 50"/>

<blockquote>Chinese writers assert that the territories of the Mongol empire were inherited by the succeeding Ming Dynasty&nbsp;...&nbsp;The main problem with Chinese claims that later dynasties inherited Mongol lands is that the Mongol empire included vast areas of Asia and eastern Europe which were not in fact controlled by the Ming or Qing dynasties. The Mongols conquered most of Eurasia, and their territory extended from Lithuania in the West to Persia in the south. But although contemporary Chinese histories emphatically state that Tibet became part of Chinese territory as a result of Mongol conquests, they do not attempt to claim that Lithuanians are a minority nationality of China or that the Crimea is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.<ref name="powers 50">John Powers, ''History as propaganda: Tibetan exiles versus the People's Republic of China'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 50.</ref>

Chen Qingying, Professor of History and Director of the History Studies Institute under the [[China Tibetology Research Center]] in Beijing, writes that the Ming court conferred new official positions on ex-Yuan Tibetan leaders of the Phachu Kargyu and granted them lower-ranking positions.<ref name="chen 48">Chen, ''Tibetan History'', 48.</ref> Of the county (zong or dzong) leaders of Neiwo Zong and Renbam Zong, Chen states that when "the Emperor learned the actual situation of the Phachu Kargyu, the Ming court then appointed the main Zong leaders to be senior officers of the Senior Command of Dbus and Gtsang."<ref name="chen 48"/> The official posts that the Ming court established in Tibet, such as senior and junior commanders, offices of Qianhu (in charge of 1,000 households), and offices of Wanhu (in charge of 10,000 households), were all hereditary positions according to Chen, but he asserts that "the succession of some important posts still had to be approved by the emperor," while old imperial mandates had to be returned to the Ming court for renewal.<ref name="chen 48"/>

Wang and Nyima state that after the official title "Education Minister" was granted to Janchub Gyalts<U+00E4>n (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302&ndash;1364) by the Yuan court, this title appeared frequently with his name in various Tibetan texts, while his Tibetan title "Degsi" is seldom mentioned.<ref name="wang nyima 42">Wang & Nyima, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet'', 42.</ref> Wang and Nyima take this to mean that "even in the later period of the Yuan Dynasty, the Yuan imperial court and the Pagmo Drupa regime maintained a Central-local government relation."<ref name="wang nyima 42"/> Janchub Gyalts<U+00E4>n is even supposed to have written in his will: "In the past I received loving care from the emperor in the east.

However, Lok-Ham Chan, a professor of history at the [[University of Washington]], writes that Janchub Gyalts<U+00E4>n's aims were to recreate the old Tibetan Kingdom that existed during the Chinese Tang Dynasty, to build "nationalist sentiment" amongst Tibetans, and to "remove all traces of Mongol suzerainty."<ref name="chan 262"/> Georges Dreyfus, a professor of religion at [[Williams College]], writes that it was Janchub Gyalts<U+00E4>n who adopted the old administrative system of [[Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo]] (c. 605&ndash;649)<U+2014>the first Yarlung king to establish Tibet as a strong power<U+2014>by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units.<ref name="dreyfus 504">Georges Dreyfus, "Cherished memories, cherished communities: proto-nationalism in Tibet", in ''The History of Tibet: Volume 2, The Medieval Period: c.

According to Chen, the Ming officer of Hezhou (modern day [[Linxia]]) informed the Hongwu Emperor that the general situation in Dbus and Gtsang "was under control," and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second Phagmodru ruler Sagya Gyaincain an official title.<ref name="chen 44">Chen, ''Tibetan History'', 44.</ref> According to the Records of the Founding Emperor, Hongwu issued an edict granting the title "Initiation State Master" to Sagya Gyaincain, while the latter sent envoys to the Ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira.<ref name="chen 44"/> 

Dreyfus writes that after the Phagmodru myriarchy lost its centralizing power over Tibet in 1434, several attempts by other families to establish hegemonies failed over the next two centuries until 1642 with [[Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama|Lozang Gyatso, the Fifth Dalai Lama's]] effective hegemony over Tibet.<ref name="dreyfus 504"/>

In China not only the emperor could do no wrong, but also his prestige and dignity had to be upheld at any cost.

===Contact with the Ming Dynasty===
[[Image:Wanli.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Wanli Emperor]] (r. 1572&ndash;1620)]]
Sonam Gyatso, after being granted the grandiose title by Altan Khan, departed for Tibet. Before he left, he sent a letter and gifts to the Ming Chinese official [[Zhang Juzheng]] (1525&ndash;1582), which arrived on [[March 12]], [[1579]].<ref name="dictionary of ming biography 23">''Dictionary of Ming Biography'', 23.</ref> Sometime in August or September of that year, Sonam Gyatso's representative stationed with Altan Khan received a return letter and gift from the [[Wanli Emperor]] (r.&nbsp;1572&ndash;1620), who also conferred upon Sonam Gyatso a title; this was the first official contact between a Dalai Lama and a government of China.<ref name="dictionary of ming biography 23"/> However, Laird states that when Wanli invited him to Beijing, the Dalai Lama declined the offer due to a prior commitment, even though he was only 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;miles) from Beijing.<ref name="laird 146">Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 146.</ref> Laird adds that "the power of the Ming emperor did not reach very far at the time."<ref name="laird 146"/> Although not recorded in any official Chinese records, Sonam Gyatso's biography states that Wanli again conferred titles on Sonam Gyatso in 1588, and invited him to Beijing for a second time, but Sonam Gyatso was unable to visit China as he died in [[Mongolia]] while en route to Tibet, after working since 1585 with Altan Khan's son in Mongolia to further the spread of Buddhism.<ref name="dictionary of ming biography 23"/><ref name="laird 146"/> 

Of the third Dalai Lama, ''China Daily'' states that the "Ming Dynasty showed him special favor by allowing him to pay tribute."<ref name="china daily"/> ''China Daily'' then says that Sonam Gyatso was granted the title Dorjichang or Vajradhara Dalai Lama in 1587 [sic!],<ref name="china daily"/> but ''China Daily'' does not mention who granted him the title. Without mentioning the role of the Mongols, ''China Daily'' states that it was the successive Qing Dynasty which established the title of ''Dalai Lama'' and his power in Tibet: "In 1653, the Qing emperor granted an honorific title to the fifth Dalai Lama and then did the same for the fifth Bainqen Lama in 1713, officially establishing the titles of the Dalai Lama and the Bainqen Erdeni, and their political and religious status in Tibet."<ref name="china daily"/>

Chen states that the fourth Dalai Lama Yonten Gyatso was granted the title "Master of Vajradhara" and an official seal by the Wanli Emperor in 1616.<ref name="chen reincarnation 33">Chen Qingying, ''The System of the Dalai Lama Reincarnation'' (Beijing: China Intercontinental Press, 2005), 33.</ref> This was noted in the ''Biography of the Fourth Dalai Lama'', which stated that one Soinam Lozui delivered the seal of the Emperor to the Dalai Lama.<ref name="chen reincarnation 33"/> The Wanli Emperor had invited Yonten Gyatso to Beijing in 1616, but just like his predecessor he died before being able to make the journey.<ref name="chen reincarnation 33"/>

Kolma<U+0161> writes that, as the Mongol presence in Tibet increased, culminating in the conquest of Tibet by a Mongol leader in 1642, the Ming emperors "viewed with apparent unconcern these developments in Tibet."<ref name="kolmas 31 32"/> He adds that the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet was one of the reasons why the Mongols pounced on the chance to reclaim their old vassal of Tibet and "fill once more the political vacuum in that country."<ref name="kolmas 32"/> On the mass Mongol conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under Altan Khan, Laird writes that "the Chinese watched these developments with interest, though few Chinese ever became devout Tibetan Buddhists."<ref name="laird 144">Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 144.</ref>

In 1565, the powerful Rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, who styled himself as the Tsangpa or <U+00DC>-Tsang king and established his base of power at [[Shigatse]].<ref name="kolmas 29">Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 29.</ref><ref name="laird 152">Laird, ''The Story of Tibet'', 152.</ref><ref name="karmay 3"/> The second successor of this first <U+00DC>-Tsang king, who reigned from 1611&ndash;1621, took control of the whole of Central Tibet.<ref name="karmay 2">Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'', 2.</ref> Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Yellow Hat sect, while the <U+00DC>-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa.<ref name="karmay 2"/> Tensions rose between the nationalistic <U+00DC>-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa.<ref name="karmay 3"/> The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the <U+00DC>-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Yellow Hat monasteries.<ref name="karmay 3"/> Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the <U+00DC>-Tsang king to have him murdered for "cursing" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle.<ref name="chen reincarnation 33 34">Chen, ''The System of the Dalai Lama Reincarnation'', 33&ndash;34.</ref> In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Yellow Hat sect and the Red Hat sect went to war, the Red Hats supported by the secular <U+00DC>-Tsang king.<ref name="goldstein 6">Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 6.</ref> The <U+00DC>-Tsang ruler had a large number of Yellow Hat lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]], and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama.<ref name="goldstein 6"/> In 1621, the <U+00DC>-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama.<ref name="karmay 3"/> Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new <U+00DC>-Tsang ruler, Sonam Ch<U+00F6>pel (1595&ndash;1657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the <U+00DC>-Tsang king, which led to another conflict.<ref name="karmay 3 4">Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'', 3&ndash;4.</ref> In 1633, the Yellow Hats and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the <U+00DC>-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.<ref name="goldstein 6"/> Goldstein writes that in this the "Mongols were again playing a significant role in Tibetan affairs, this time as the military arm of the Dalai Lama."<ref name="goldstein 6"/>

When an ally of the <U+00DC>-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Yellow Hats again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince [[G<U+00FC>shi Khan]] (1582&ndash;1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]], who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa.<ref name="goldstein 9">Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', 9.</ref><ref name="kolmas 31"/><ref name="van praag 10">Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 10</ref><ref name="karmay 4"/> G<U+00FC>shi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637&ndash;1640 he not only defeated the Yellow Hats' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo.<ref name="goldstein 9"/><ref name="kolmas 31"/> Sonam Ch<U+00F6>pel urged G<U+00FC>shi Khan to assault the <U+00DC>-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which G<U+00FC>shi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Yellow Hat monks and supporters.<ref name="goldstein 9"/><ref name="karmay 4"/> In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the <U+00DC>-Tsang forces surrendered.<ref name="karmay 4">Karmay, ''Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama'', 4.</ref> G<U+00FC>shi Khan then captured and summarily executed the ruler of <U+00DC>-Tsang, King of Tibet.<ref name="goldstein 9"/><ref name="van praag 10"/>

Soon after the victory in <U+00DC>-Tsang, G<U+00FC>shi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama.<ref name="karmay 4"/> In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, G<U+00FC>shi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Ch<U+00F6>pel.<ref name="goldstein 9"/><ref name="van praag 10"/><ref name="karmay 4"/> Although G<U+00FC>shi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama "supreme authority" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon G<U+00FC>shi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter.<ref name="goldstein 9"/><ref name="kolmas 31 32">Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 31&ndash;32.</ref><ref name="van praag 10 11">Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 10&ndash;11.</ref> Van Praag writes that at this point G<U+00FC>shi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama.<ref name="van praag 10 11"/> Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and G<U+00FC>shi Khan during his early secular and religious reign.<ref name="rawski 250 251">Rawski, ''The Last Emperors'', 250&ndash;251.</ref> However, Rawski states that he eventually "expanded his own authority by presenting himself as [[Avalokitesvara]] through the performance of rituals," by building the [[Potala Palace]] and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.<ref name="rawski 251">Rawski, ''The Last Emperors'', 251.</ref> Goldstein states that the government of G<U+00FC>shi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Black Hat Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Yellow Hat Gelug monasteries.<ref name="goldstein 9"/> Rawski writes that this Mongol patronage allowed the Yellow Hats to dominate the rival religious sects in Tibet.<ref name="rawski 251"/>

Meanwhile, the Chinese Ming Dynasty fell to the rebellion of [[Li Zicheng]] (1606&ndash;1645) in 1644, yet his short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]] was crushed by the [[Manchu]] invasion and the Han Chinese general [[Wu Sangui]] (1612&ndash;1678). ''China Daily'' states that when the following Qing Dynasty replaced the Ming Dynasty, it merely "strengthened administration of Tibet."<ref name="china daily"/> However, Kolma<U+0161> states that the Dalai Lama was very observant of what was going on in China and accepted a Manchu invitation in 1640 to send envoys to their capital at [[Mukden]] in 1642, before the Ming collapsed.<ref name="kolmas 34 35">Kolmas, ''Tibet and Imperial China'', 34&ndash;35.</ref><ref name="van praag 11">Van Praag, ''The Status of Tibet'', 11.</ref> Dawa Norbu, William Rockhill, and George N.

When the [[Dzungar]] Mongols attempted to spread their territory from what is now [[Xinjiang]] into Tibet, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (r.&nbsp;1661&ndash;1722) responded to Tibetan pleas for aid with his own invasion of Tibet in 1717, occupying Lhasa in 1720.<ref name="ebrey 227">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 227.</ref><ref name="kolb 368">Albert Kolb, ''East Asia: China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam: Geography of a Cultural Region'', trans.
