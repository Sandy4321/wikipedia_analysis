'''''Kadua parvula''''' (formerly ''Hedyotis parvula'') is a rare species of flowering plant in the [[Rubiaceae|coffee family]] known by the common name '''rockface star-violet'''. It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Hawaii]], where it is known only from the [[Waianae Mountains]] on the island of [[Oahu]].<ref name=tnc>[http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Hedyotis+parvula ''Kadua parvula''.] [[The Nature Conservancy]].</ref> It is a federally listed [[endangered species]] of the United States.

This is a branching [[shrub]] growing erect or spreading, the branches reaching 10 to 40 centimeters in length. The lance-shaped or pointed oval leaves are densely spaced on the branches, sometimes overlapping. Each is up to 4 centimeters long by 3 wide and leathery in texture. The flowers may be [[Plant sexuality|bisexual]] or functionally female with fleshy white lobes sometimes tinged pink at the tips. The plants grow on cliffs and ledges in moist areas of the Waianae Mountains.<ref name=tnc/>

There are only two known populations extant. One is located on the M<U+0101>kua Military Reservation, and the other is at Halona. Together they contain at least 263 individual plants.<ref name=five>USFWS. [http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc1817.pdf ''Kadua parvula'' Five-year Review.] January 2008.</ref>

Threats to the plant include habitat degradation and destruction by [[feral pig]]s and [[feral goat|goats]] and [[introduced species|non-native plants]] such as ''[[Ageratina riparia]]'', ''[[Erigeron karvinskianus]]'', ''[[Grevillea robusta]]'', ''[[Melinis minutiflora]]'', ''[[Rubus argutus]]'', and ''[[Schinus terebinthifolius]]''.<ref name=five/>
