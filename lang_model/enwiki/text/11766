The '''Grand Olympic Auditorium''' is a sports venue in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[United States]]. Located at 1801 S. Grand Avenue, the venue was built in [[1924]] specifically for the [[1932 Summer Olympic Games]], which saw the [[boxing]], [[weightlifting]], and [[wrestling]] events held there. At the time it was the largest indoor venue in the [[United States|U.S.]], originally seating 15,300. The grand opening of the Olympic Auditorium was on [[August 5]], [[1925]], and was a major media event, attended by such celebrities as [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]].

Throughout the [[1930s]], [[1940s]] and [[1950s]] it was home to some of the biggest boxing, wrestling and roller derby events and has become somewhat of a landmark for boxing history.

The [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] were a major boom period for the Olympic, as major wrestling events were held at the arena every other Friday night, as well as being the home to the roller-derby's [[Roller Games|Los Angeles T-Birds]].

Some scenes in the 1976 film [[Rocky]] were filmed at the venue.

The arena closed its doors in the mid 1980s when promoter Gene LaBell discontinued his weekly wrestling shows due to low attendance figures when the boom of the professional wrestling era began. It reopened in [[1993]], but the capacity was reduced to about 10,000.  Currently the Auditorium seats 7,030 for boxing and wrestling, 4,514 for seated concerts, and 7,007 for general admission concerts. Up to 773 seats can be put on the arena floor, which measures 12,100 square feet (110' by 110').

On [[July 16]], [[2000]], [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] held its [[ECW_Heat_Wave#2000|Heatwave]] pay-per-view at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. It was ECW's first, and only West Coast appearance. 

The Rock band [[Rage Against the Machine]] played their final show in September [[2000]] at the Olympic Auditorium before their break-up a month later for 7 years and released their DVD and CD ''[[Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium]]'' in [[2003]].

Today the Olympic Auditorium is host to many music concerts and shows, as well as boxing and wrestling.  The arena is famous for its box office number [[RI-9-5171]] which is still in use today as (213) 749-5171.  The arena is one of the last known major boxing and wrestling arenas of its respective golden eras still in existence today.

In June 2005, the [[Glory Church of Jesus Christ]], a Korean-American church purchased the entire property. It will be operated as their parish.
