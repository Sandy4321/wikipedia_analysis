The '''climate of Florida''' is humid subtropical.  There is a defined [[rainy season]] from June through September, which are the months most at risk of landfalling [[tropical cyclone]]s.  During the transition seasons, fronts regularly sweep through the state from October through May, which keeps conditions dry.  Towards the end of the [[dry season]] in the [[spring]], brush fires become common statewide.  In winters where an [[El Ni<U+00F1>o]] climate cycle exists, rainfall is greatly increased across northern Florida.  Warm waters of the nearby [[loop current]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Gulf Stream]] running through the [[Florida Straits]] keep temperatures moderate across the southern peninsula year round.

==Temperature==
On average, wintertime lows dip down to near 40&nbsp;degrees [[Fahrenheit]] at Tallahassee in January to 65&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit in Key West while daytime highs range from 64&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit at Tallahassee to 75&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit at Key West.<ref>Southeast Regional Climate Center.

The record high temperature for the state is 109&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit at Monticello in 1931.  The record low temperature was -2&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit at [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] in 1899.

==Snowfall==

==Rainfall, drought, and flood==
===Averages===
Statewide, the highest rainfall amounts occur during the summer months.  In northern Florida, there is a weak winter secondary maximum while statewide the driest months of the year are during the spring.<ref name="SR"/>  Due to the lack of the secondary maximum across the peninsula, a distinct dry season is seen in the averages from winter through spring.  This dry season provokes brush fires annually as temperatures rise during the late spring, before they fade during early June as the rainy season gets underway.

The heaviest rainfall to occur in 24 hours was measured in Yankeetown during [[Hurricane Easy (1950)]], 38.70&nbsp;inches/983&nbsp;mm.  This is also the highest known point storm total maximum related to any tropical cyclone which has impacted Florida,<ref name="DR">David Roth. [http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/tcmaxima.html Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima.] Retrieved on [[2007-06-02]].</ref> and by itself would be the highest known rainfall total for any month from any location within Florida.  This rainfall amount remained the national 24-hour rainfall record until [[Tropical Storm Claudette (1979)]].<ref>David Roth. [http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/easy1950filledrainblk.gif Hurricane Easy (1950) Rainfall Graphic.] Retrieved on [[2007-06-02]].</ref>  Heavy rainfall events have fallen due to stalled fronts near the state as well, and occur during the March through May and October through November timeframe.  The most significant drought as of late occurred began in 1989, and lasted into the beginning of the 1990 wet season.

The wettest month recorded at a Florida climate station was during May 1891 when [[Gainesville, Florida]] received 30.90&nbsp;inches/785&nbsp;mm.<ref>Florida Climate Center.

==Wind==
Over the entire year, winds average out of the north across the panhandle and near Orlando, out of the west at Gainesville and Jacksonville, and generally out of the east elsewhere.  During the summer months, the average wind pattern implies a surface ridge axis normally lies across central Florida, with easterly winds from Tampa southward and southwest winds across northern Florida, once Orlando is thrown out of the distribution.  The peak wind gust during the 1930 through 1997 period was 115&nbsp;mph/100&nbsp;knots at [[Miami International Airport]] during [[Hurricane Andrew]].<ref>[[National Climatic Data Center]].

==Tropical cyclones==
{{seealso|List of Florida hurricanes}}
The earliest a tropical cyclone has struck the sunshine state was the [[Groundhog Day Tropical Storm]] in 1952.  The latest impact was from a hurricane which struck near Tampa on December 1, 1925.  The strongest hurricane to strike Florida was the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]].  Hurricane Easy in 1950 produced the wettest known point total from any tropical cyclone.<ref name="DR"/>
