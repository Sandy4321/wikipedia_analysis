The Sennenhund are [[Working dog|farm dogs]] of the general [[molosser]] type. There are four [[dog breed|breeds]] of Sennenhund, all sharing a unique tricolour [[coat (dog)|coat]], heavy build, and a calm temperament. The breeds range from medium in size to very large.

The four Sennenhund breeds are well known in [[Switzerland]] and the rest of [[Europe]]. In the [[United States]], the Bernese Mountain Dog has become somewhat popular, while the other breeds are promoted as [[rare breed (dog)|rare]] to those seeking unique pets.

==History ==
Although said to derive from Roman [[molosser]]s,<ref name="Clark">{{cite book | last = Clark | first = Anne Rogers | authorlink = Anne Rogers Clark | title = The International Encyclopedia of Dogs | publisher = Howell Book House |coauthors= Andrew H. Brace | year = 1995 | pages = 88, 120, 214, 247 | isbn = 0-87605-624-9 |laysummary = Booklist Reviews 1996 April #2 }}</ref> the area from which the type originated never had Roman roads or towns. The dogs may have arrived much earlier than Roman times as part of the ancient [[transhumance]].  The word ''Senn'' or Senner is the term for Alpine herdsmen and dairymen<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/english-german/%5BAlpine+herdsman+and+dairyman%5D.html |title=English-German translation for: [Alpine herdsman and dairyman] |work=dict.cc English-German Dictionary |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> (an Alpine meadow is called a ''Sennelager'') who tend other farmers' cattle and sometimes sheep; Sennenhund means "dogs of the Senn".  Sennenhund were not just cattle dogs, but were kept as general farm dogs, working as [[livestock guardian dog]]s and as [[herding dog]]s when necessary, as well as [[Guard dog|guarding]] the farmers' families, homes, herds, and flocks. The guarding function was especially necessary in earlier times, when wolves and other large predators threatened livestock and people. The larger Sennenhunds were also used for [[Carting|pulling carts]].

Today, with the reintroduction of wolves, research is being done on the use of these dogs to protect livestock.<ref>[http://www.herdenschutzschweiz.ch/pdf/doc423_de.pdf The use of herd protection dogs in the Swiss Alps]{{dead link|date=April 2011}},  Jean-Marc Landry in KORA Report No. 2, August 1999, ISSN 1422-5123 (KORA: Coordinated research projects for the conservation and management of carnivores in Switzerland)</ref>

A red and white colour once found in the Sennenhunds was said to be from crosses with the St. Bernard dog, a breed from the Alps also said to be descended from Roman molossers.<ref name="Clark" />

The Sennenhund, especially the largest ones, began to disappear in the 1800s with the decline in need for butcher's dogs and carting dogs. The efforts of Alpine geologist and indigenous Swiss dog breeds advocate [[Albert Heim]] (1849-1937) brought various examples of Sennenhund to an International Dog Show in 1908. At that point Heim and other members of the Schweizerische Kynologische Gesellschaft (Swiss Kennel Club) began sorting out the dogs by what they judged to be representative [[breed type]]s, and naming the four breeds.<ref>[http://www.gssh.ch/GSClb030.htm The history of breeding and of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club (Klub f<U+00FC>r Grosse Schweizer Sennenhunde)] (in German)</ref> See individual breed articles for the history of the first [[breed club (dog)|breed clubs]] and the writing of [[breed standard (dogs)|standards]] which defined the separate breeds of the type.

== Similar breeds ==
The [[St. Bernard Dog]] was one of the first breeds of dogs to be documented and differentiated from other large farm dogs of the area. Except for colour and historical documentation, the St. Bernard is very similar to the largest  Sennenhund. Official documents from the hospice in St. Bernard Pass concerning the dogs date back to 1707, with paintings and drawings of the dog even earlier. The breed was the very first breed entered into the Swiss Stud Book in 1884, and the breed standard was finally approved in 1887.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-nmbe.unibe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1.html |title=Saint Bernard Dog |publisher=Naturhistoriches Museum der Burgergemeinde Bern |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> The Sennenhund did not begin to be divided into breeds until 1908. 

Another butcher's dog from Germany, the [[Rottweiler]], is similar in shape to the Sennenhunds, and may be related.

== Tricolour ==
A tricolour coat is a pattern of some shade of black or brown, some shade of red often called tan, and some white. [[Eumelanin#Eumelanin|Eumelanin]] and [[phaeomelanin]] pigmentation occurs on the same dog; "the back is black from eumelanin pigment being made and the belly is tan or red from phaeomelanin pigment being made".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~schmutz/agouti.html#tricolor |last=Schmutz |first=Sheila M. |title=Tricolor, Black-and-Tan, Tan Points (at) |work=Genetics of Coat Color and Type in Dogs |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref>
