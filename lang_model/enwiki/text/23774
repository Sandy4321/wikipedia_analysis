'''Terrence Vance "Terry" Gilliam''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|<U+0261>|<U+026A>|l|i|<U+0259>m}}; born 22 November 1940) is a screenwriter, film director, animator, actor and member of the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe. Gilliam is also known for directing several films, including ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), ''[[The Fisher King (film)|The Fisher King]]'' (1991), ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' (1995), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'' (2009). He is the only "Python" not born in Britain, and took British citizenship in 1968.

==Early life==
Gilliam was born in [[Medicine Lake, Minnesota]], the son of Beatrice (n<U+00E9>e Vance) and James Hall Gilliam,<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/80/Terry-Gilliam.html</ref> who was a traveling salesman for [[Folgers]] before becoming a carpenter. Gilliam has two siblings: a sister two years younger, and a brother ten years younger.

The family moved to [[Panorama City]], California, in 1952 because of his sister's bout of pneumonia. Gilliam attended [[Birmingham High School]] where he was class president and senior [[prom]] King, was voted "Most Likely to Succeed", and achieved straight A's. During high school, he discovered ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, which was then edited by [[Harvey Kurtzman]]; this later influenced his work.<ref>{{cite book

Following high school, he attended [[Occidental College]], studying physics and fine arts before finally majoring in political science. Gilliam contributed to the college magazine, ''Fang'', becoming the editor during his junior year and turning it into a tribute to Kurtzman, to whom he later sent copies. While in college, Gilliam was a member of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity. After finishing college, Gilliam worked briefly for an advertising agency before Kurtzman offered him a job at ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'' magazine.

Gilliam later spoke to [[Salman Rushdie]] about defining experiences in the 1960s that would set the foundations for his views on the world, later influencing his art and career:

{{quote|I became terrified that I was going to be a full-time, bomb-throwing terrorist if I stayed [in the U.S.] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66<U+2013>'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles. [...] In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way. [...] And I drove around this little English [[Hillman Minx]]<U+2014>top down<U+2014>and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy<U+2019>s foolish daughter. And I said, "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop. [...]<br>
And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here<U+2014>I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|"Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam"<ref name="rushdie">[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam "Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam"], ''The Believer'', March 2003</ref>}}

==Career==
===Animations===

Terry Gilliam started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. One of his early [[fumetti|photographic strips]] for ''Help!'' featured future Python cast-member [[John Cleese]]. When ''Help!'' folded, Gilliam went to Europe, jokingly announcing in the very last issue that he was "being transferred to the European branch" of the magazine,<ref name="rushdie" /> which of course did not exist. Moving to England, he animated features for ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]],'' which also featured future Pythons [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]], and [[Michael Palin]].

===Monty Python===
[[Image:Pythonsinscarf.jpg|thumb|230px|Terry Gilliam (left) with his Monty Python colleagues Eric Idle and Terry Jones in the 1970s. With glasses: [[Neil Innes]].]]
Gilliam was a part of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' from its outset, at first credited as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits), later as a full member. His cartoons linked the show's sketches together, and defined the group's visual language in other media (such as LP and book covers, and the title sequences of their films). Gilliam's [[Surrealism|surreal]] animations have a distinctive, memorable style, mixing his own art, characterized by soft gradients and odd, bulbous shapes, with backgrounds and moving cutouts from antique photographs, mostly from the [[Victorian era]].

Besides doing the animations, he also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had any main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did however have some notable sketch roles such as Cardinal Fang of the Spanish Inquisition, "I Want More Beans!" (''Most Awful Family in Britain 1974'', Episode 45) and the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask singing "Ding dong merrily on high."

More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play (generally because they required a lot of make-up or uncomfortable costumes, such as a recurring knight in armour who would end sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken) and took a number of small roles in the films, including [[Patsy (Monty Python)|Patsy]] in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (which he co-directed with [[Terry Jones]], where Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones would guide the actors' performances) and the jailer in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''.

===Directing===
With the gradual break-up of the Python troupe between ''The Life of Brian'' in 1979 and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' in 1982, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.

Gilliam says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with ''Time Bandits'' in 1981. The 1980s saw Gilliam's self-written ''Trilogy of Imagination'' about "the ages of man" in ''Time Bandits'' (1981), ''Brazil'' (1985), and ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' (1988). All are about the "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible."<ref name="essay">Matthews, Jack (1996). ''Dreaming Brazil'' (essay accompanying [[The Criterion Collection]] DVD release).</ref> All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; ''Time Bandits'', through the eyes of a child, ''Brazil'', through the eyes of a thirty-something year old, and ''Munchausen'', through the eyes of an elderly man.

Throughout the 1990s, Gilliam directed his ''Trilogy of Americana'', ''The Fisher King'' (1991), ''12 Monkeys'' (1995), and ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (1998), which were based on scripts by other people, played on North American soil, and while still being surreal, had less fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.<ref>Pirie, Chris (2002).

===Themes and philosophy===
[[Image:Terry Gilliam(CannesPhotoCall).jpg|thumb|right|Terry Gilliam at Cannes, 2001]]
{{quote|Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term [[magic realism]], whoever invented it <U+2013> I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.|Terry Gilliam: ''Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam''<ref name="rushdie" />}}

As for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show ''[[First Hand]]'' on RoundhouseTV: "There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be in the media and if you'll have to say things, you have to ''know'' things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture ''[and]'' literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can ''fly...!''"<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v7YjOCC-cM Terry Gilliam] on ''RoundhouseTV'', uploaded to YouTube by RoundhouseTV themselves</ref>

His films are usually highly imaginative [[fantasy|fantasies]]. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown comments about Gilliam's recurring interests, "the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on ''[...]'' that's very much a Terry theme."<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2008). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/parncmck.htm ''Charles McKeown on writing the ''Dr Parnassus'' script''], Dreams</ref> Most of Gilliam's movies include plot-lines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of [[Personal identity (philosophy)|identity]] and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes "higher" and "lower" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made [[Cult image|idol]], or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, [[paranoia|paranoid]] atmosphere and unusual characters who formerly were normal members of society. His scripts feature [[black comedy]] and often end with a dark [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] twist.

As Gilliam is fascinated with the [[Baroque]] due to the historical age's pronounced struggle between spirituality and logical rationality,<ref>"The clash between the baroque and the Newtonian view of the world is my message in a bottle.", [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/bmfact.htm ''Dreams: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'']</ref><ref name="hamel">"In Weber<U+2019>s view, the technological world of modernity tries to eliminate any need for magic, fantasy, or any irrational forces. Gilliam presents this idea of change 'from without' through certain aspects of his mise-en-scene.", Hamel, James Keith. [http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue06/features/brazil.htm ''Modernity and Mise-en-scene: Terry Gilliam and ''Brazil], from ''Images: Journal of Film and Popular Culture'', issue 6</ref> there is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticity about the movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with low-tech magnifying lenses in ''Brazil'', and in ''[[The Fisher King (film)|The Fisher King]]'' a red [[knight]] covered with flapping bits of cloth. He also is given to incongruous [[juxtaposition]]s of beauty and ugliness, or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliam's theme of modernity's struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]] society, film critic James Keith Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliam's movies with the writings of economic historian [[Arnold Toynbee]] and sociologist [[Max Weber]], specifically the latter's concept of the ''[[Iron cage]]'' of modern rationality.<ref name="hamel" />

===Look and style===
Gilliam's films have a distinctive look not only in mise-en-scene but even more so in photography, often recognizable from just a short clip; in order to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out-of-balance, Gilliam makes frequent use of unusual camera angles, particularly [[low-angle shot]]s, [[high-angle shot]]s, and [[Dutch angle]]s. [[Roger Ebert]] has said "his world is always [[hallucination|hallucinatory]] in its richness of detail."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050825/REVIEWS/50822002/1023 "The Brothers Grimm Review"]</ref> Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with [[rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] [[ultra wide angle lens]]es of 28&nbsp;mm [[focal length]] or less in order to achieve a distinctive signature style defined by extreme [[perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] and extremely [[deep focus]]. In fact, over the years, the 14mm lens has become informally known as "The Gilliam" among film-makers due to the director's frequent use of it since at least ''Brazil''.<ref>Stubbs, Phil: [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tidegill.htm "Terry Gilliam talks ''Tideland''," ''Dreams'']</ref>

{{quote|The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like I'm in the space of the film, I'm surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and that's what I like about it. It's actually harder to do, it's harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that I'm not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important. It's there, but there's other things to occupy, and some people don't like that because I'm not pointing things out as precisely as I could if I was to use a long lense where I'd focus just on the one thing and everything else would be out of focus. [...]<br>
[M]y films, I think, are better the second and third time, frankly, because you can now relax and go with the flow that may not have been as apparent as the first time you saw it and wallow in the details of the worlds we're creating. [...] I try to clutter [my visuals] up, they're worthy of many viewings.|Terry Gilliam, "Gilliam's 'Imaginarium': Surreal And All-Too-Real", ''[[Fresh Air]]'', [[National Public Radio]]<ref>Bianculli, David (2009).

In another interview, Gilliam also mentioned, in relation to the 9.8mm Kinoptic lens he had first used on ''Brazil'', that wide-angle lenses make small film sets "look big".<ref>Sheehan, Henry (2006).

===Production problems===
[[Image:Terry Gilliam at IFC Center 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Terry Gilliam at IFC Center. 4 October 2006.]]Gilliam has made a few extremely expensive movies beset with production problems. After the lengthy quarreling with [[Universal Studios]] over ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam's next picture, ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', cost around US$46 million,<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=adventuresofbaronmunchausen.htm Box Office Mojo]</ref> and then earned only about US$8 million in US ticket sales.  The film saw no wide domestic release from [[Columbia Pictures]], which was in the process of being sold at the time.

In the mid-1990s, Gilliam and [[Charles McKeown]] developed a script for ''Time Bandits 2'', a project that never came to be.  Several of the original actors had died.  Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and choice of lead actor.<ref>{{cite book

In 1999, Gilliam attempted to film ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]'', budgeted at US$32.1 million, among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing [[Don Quixote]] ([[Jean Rochefort]]) suffered a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]], and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an [[insurance]] claim of US$15 million.<ref>{{cite book

Gilliam has attempted twice to adapt [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' comics into a [[Watchmen (film)|film]]. Both attempts (in 1989 and 1996) were unsuccessful.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}  Most recently, unforeseeable problems again befell a Gilliam project when actor [[Heath Ledger]] died in New York City during the filming of ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]''.

On the other hand, Gilliam's first successful feature, ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), earned more than eight times its original budget in the United States alone; ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' (1988) was nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s (and won, among other European prizes, three [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]]); ''The Fisher King'' (1991) (his first film not to feature a member from Python) was nominated for five (and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]); and ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' went on to take over US$168 million worldwide; whilst ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'', despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105 million worldwide. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], his films have grossed an average of $26,009,723.

===Recurring collaborators===
Ever since his first Python-independent feature ''Jabberwocky'', Gilliam has shown a propensity to work with particular actors in numerous productions. Up until the 1990s, each of Gilliam's non-Python films was to feature at least one of his fellow [[Monty Python]] alumni (particularly Palin, Cleese, and Idle), and for his finished projects Gilliam has worked with the following actors more than once (in order of first film appearance):

*[[Derrick O'Connor]] (''Jabberwocky'', ''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'')
*[[Ian Holm]] (''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'')
*[[Peter Vaughan]] (''Time Bandits'', ''Brazil'')

*[[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] (''Brazil'', ''12 Monkeys'')
*[[Robin Williams]] (''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', ''The Fisher King''; also was to play Cavaldi in ''The Brothers Grimm'' until objections by producers [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]])
*[[Jeff Bridges]] (''The Fisher King'', ''Tideland'')
*[[Michael Jeter]] (''The Fisher King'', ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'')
*[[Tom Waits]] (''The Fisher King'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'')
*[[Christopher Plummer]] (''12 Monkeys'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'')
*[[Christopher Meloni]] (''12 Monkeys'', ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'')

*[[Verne Troyer]] (''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'')
*[[Heath Ledger]] (''The Brothers Grimm'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'')
*[[Peter Stormare]] (''The Brothers Grimm'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'')

Other recurring collaborators include Gilliam's cinematographers [[Roger Pratt (cinematographer)|Roger Pratt]] (''Brazil'', ''The Fisher King'', ''12 Monkeys'') and [[Nicola Pecorini]] (''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', ''The Brothers Grimm'', ''Tideland'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus''), and his co-writer McKeown (''Brazil'', ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'', ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'').

===Gilliam and ''Harry Potter''===
[[J. K. Rowling]], author of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, is a fan of Gilliam's work. Consequently, he was Rowling's first choice to direct ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' in 2000. [[Warner Bros.]] refused to consider Gilliam as director, instead selecting [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] for the job.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/bio IMDb: Biography for Terry Gilliam]. Accessed 22 April 2007.</ref> Recently, Gilliam stated in relation to this episode, "I was the perfect guy to do Harry Potter. I remember leaving the meeting, getting in my car, and driving for about two hours along [[Mulholland Drive]] just so angry. I mean, Chris Columbus' versions are terrible. Just dull. Pedestrian."<ref>[http://www.wizardnews.com/story.20050829.html Terry Gilliam Bitter About Potter]</ref>

Gilliam has stated that he will never direct any [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Potter'' film]]. In a 2005  interview with [[Total Film Magazine]], he stated that he would not enjoy working on such an expensive project due to interference from studio executives.<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/gilliam%20vows%20never%20to%20direct%20harry%20potter Gilliam Vows Never To Direct Harry Potter]</ref>

===Secret Tournament===
In 2002, Gilliam directed a series of television advertisements called ''[[Secret Tournament]]''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A776009 'The Secret Tournament' <U+2013> the Nike World Cup 2002 Advert]</ref> The advertisements were part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Football World Cup]] campaign, and featured a secret three-on-three tournament between the world's best football players inside a huge tanker ship, with the [[Elvis Presley]] song "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" playing during the advertisements.

===Slava's Diabolo===
[[File:Terry Gilliam KVIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Gilliam at the 41st Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, April 2006]]
In 1996, Gilliam directed the stage show ''Slava's Diabolo'' created and staged by Russian [[clown]] artist [[Slava Polunin]]. The show combines Polunin's clown style, characterized by deep non-verbal expression and interaction with the audience, with Gilliam's rich visuals and surrealistic imagery. The show premiered at the Noga hall of the Gesher theater in [[Jaffa, Israel]].

===''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus''===

===Projects in development or shelved===
Gilliam has several projects in various states of development, including an adaptation of [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Terry Pratchett]]'s comic fantasy novel ''[[Good Omens]]''. Other projects Gilliam has been trying to get off the ground since the 1990s are an adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (starring [[Mel Gibson]]), an adaptation of ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' by [[Mark Twain]] (which [[List of films based on Arthurian legend#Connecticut Yankee|has been adapted into movies several times before]]), and a script titled ''The Defective Detective'' that Gilliam has co-authored with [[Richard LaGravenese]] (who wrote Gilliam's ''[[The Fisher King (film)|The Fisher King]]'' before).

It was rumoured that Gilliam may direct <U+2013> or be involved in the production of <U+2013> the animated band [[Gorillaz]]' movie. In a September 2006 interview with [[Uncut (magazine)|''Uncut'' magazine]], [[Damon Albarn]] was reported saying "... we're making a film. We've got Terry Gilliam involved."<ref name="Uncut">{{Cite web| url = http://gorillaz-news.livejournal.com/169939.html#cutid1 | title = West London Calling | accessdate = 11 October 2006 | author = Williamson, Nigel | date = November 2006 issue, pg 88 | publisher = ''Uncut'' }}</ref> However, in a more recent interview with Gorillaz-Unofficial,  [[Jamie Hewlett]], the co-creator of the band, stated that since the time of the previous interview, Damon's and his own fixation on the film had lessened. In an August 2008 ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' interview, Gorillaz band members Albarn and Hewlett revealed the nature and title of the project, ''Journey to the West'', a movie adaptation of the [[Journey to the West|opera of the same name]] based on a 16th-century Chinese adventure story also known as [[Monkey (novel)|''Monkey'']].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/aug/10/music.classicalandopera ''Monkey magic''], The Observer, 10 August 2008</ref> In January 2008, while on set of ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', Gilliam stated that he was looking forward to the project, "But I'm still waiting to see a script!"<ref name="Dreams: 2008 News Blog"/>

''Zero Theorem'' was a planned feature film project by Gilliam. The [[science fiction film]] would have starred [[Billy Bob Thornton]].<ref name="brend01">Brendon Connelly [http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/01/26/script-review-terry-gilliams-upcoming-sci-fi-thriller-the-zero-theorem/ Script Review: Terry Gilliam<U+2019>s Upcoming Sci-Fi Thriller, The Zero Theorem] ''[[/Film|slashfilm.com]]'', January 26, 2009</ref> Participating were producer [[Richard D.

===Future projects===
After regaining the rights to the screenplay of ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]'', Gilliam restarted pre-production in 2008, with Johnny Depp still attached to the project.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pandora: Don Quixote rides again, says delighted Gilliam | author = Alica-Azania Jarvis | publisher = The Independent | date = 4 August 2008 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-don-quixote-rides-again-says-delighted-gilliam-884243.html | accessdate = 4 August 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The film will be reshot completely, and Rochefort's role will be recast. Michael Palin reportedly entered talks with Gilliam to step in for Rochefort and play Don Quixote.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Monty Python <U+2013> Palin to act alongside Depp? | publisher = Contact Music | date = 26 May 2008 | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/palin%20to%20act%20alongside%20depp_1069633 | accessdate = 25 July 2008}}</ref> However, Gilliam revealed on Canadian talk show ''[[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Hour]]'' on 17 December 2009, that [[Robert Duvall]] had been cast to play Quixote.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/ID=1362888191 | work=CBC News}}</ref>

Gilliam is to make his opera debut at London's [[English National Opera]] in May 2011, directing ''[[The Damnation of Faust]]'' by [[Hector Berlioz]].<ref>{{cite web| title = The Damnation of Faust | publisher = ENO | url = http://www.eno.org/see-whats-on/productions/production-page.php?&itemid=1087 | accessdate = 23 October 2010}}</ref>

On December 16, 2010, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Gilliam is to "godfather" a film called ''1884'' which is described as an animated [[steampunk]] parody of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', with several former Pythons lending their voice talents to the project whereas Gilliam will be credited as "creative adviser".<ref>Hopewell, John; Keslassy, Elsa (2010). [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118029166?refCatId=13 ''Gilliam to godfather '1884': Tim Ollive to helm retro sci-fi fantasy''], Variety, December 16th, 2010</ref>

==Personal life==
Gilliam has been married to the British make-up and costume designer Maggie Weston since 1973. She worked on ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', many of the Python movies, and Gilliam's movies up to ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]''. They have three children, Amy (b. 1978), Holly (b. 1980), and Harry (b. 1988), who have also appeared in several of Gilliam's films.

In 1968, Gilliam obtained British citizenship, then held dual American and British citizenship for the next 38 years. In January 2006 he renounced his American citizenship.<ref>[http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/06/movies/main2071659.shtml CBS News "ShowBUZZ": Terry Gilliam Sounds Off], 6 October 2006</ref> In an interview with ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'',<ref name="tagesspiegel">[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/;art772,2004101 oew/dpa/ddp (10 February 2006). Kopflos am Potsdamer Platz. ''tagesspiegel''] ({{de icon}}, retrieved 15 September 2007)</ref> he described the action as a protest against then President [[George W. Bush]], and in an earlier interview with The Onion AV Club,<ref name="tagonionav">[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/54008 AV Club interview]</ref> he also indicated that it was related to concerns about future tax liability for his wife and children. As a result of renouncing his citizenship, Gilliam is only permitted to spend 30 days per year in the United States, fewer than ordinary British citizens.<ref name="tagesspiegel"/> Gilliam also maintains a residence in Italy near the [[Umbria]]-[[Tuscany]] border. He has been instrumental in establishing the annual Umbria Film Festival,<ref>[http://www.umbriafilmfestival.com/ Umbria Film Festival web site]</ref> held in the nearby hill town of [[Montone]].
