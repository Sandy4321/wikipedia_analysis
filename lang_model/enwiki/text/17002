'''King's Highway 19''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 19''', is a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], connecting [[Ontario Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]] in [[Tillsonburg]] with [[Highway&nbsp;401]] southeast of [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]]. Highway 19 is {{convert|18.8|km|abbr=on}} long, which is similar to its original length in 1930, starting at Highway&nbsp;3 in the south and ending at [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]] in the north.  The highway began as the '''Plank and Gravel Road''', a toll road formed by the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company. It was first assigned in 1930. Several extensions in the early 1930s took the route north to [[Ontario Highway 86|Highway&nbsp;86]] at [[Tralee, Ontario|Tralee]]. However, a significant amount of Highway&nbsp;19 was [[decommissioned highway|decomissioned]] and turned over to local and county governments in 1997 and 1998.

== Route description ==
The southern end of Highway&nbsp;19 begins at Highway&nbsp;3 in Tillsonburg, while the northern end terminates 400&nbsp;metres north of the centreline of [[Highway&nbsp;401]], southeast of the Ingersoll town limits. Highway&nbsp;19 is situated entirely in [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]] and serves the communities of [[Ostrander, Ontario|Ostrander]], [[Mount Elgin, Ontario|Mount Elgin]] and [[Salford, Ontario|Salford]]. Prior to 1998, it began in [[Port Burwell, Ontario|Port Burwell]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]], while the northern terminus extended to [[Ontario Highway 86|Highway&nbsp;86]] east of [[Listowel, Ontario|Listowel]] in the community of Tralee.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

The route begins on the southern edge of Tillsonburg at Highway&nbsp;3 (Talbot Road), travelling north along the eastern side of Big Otter Creek. This section of the highway, known as Vienna Road, lies next to a business/industrial park. At County Road&nbsp;51 (Simcoe Street), Vienna Road ends and Highway&nbsp;19 turns west, becoming Oxford Street and crossing Big Otter Creek. At Broadway Street, Highway&nbsp;19 turns northwest and passes through the downtown strip as well as beside [[Tillsonburg Town Centre]]. It continues into residential subdivisions, eventually exiting the town into the municipality of [[South-West Oxford]] as it turns north at Quarter Town Line and becomes Plank Line.<ref name="2010 mapart" /><ref name="gmaps">{{Google maps

The route enters farmland, but bisects the hamlet of Ostrander shortly thereafter. It crosses the [[Ontario Southland Railway]], which lies roughly parallel to the entire length of the highway, before passing west of [[Tillsonburg Airport]] and curving northwest. After travelling through farmland, the route enter Mount Elgin and intersects County Road&nbsp;18 (Mt. Elgin Road). After, it continues through more farmland to the community of Salford, where it encounter County Road&nbsp;46 (Salford Road). It turns northward briefly, emerging back into agricultural surroundings for the final stretch of the route. Just southeast of Ingersoll, it encounters an interchange with Highway&nbsp;401 (Exit&nbsp;218); Highway&nbsp;19 ends immediately north of the westbound ramps. County Road&nbsp;119 (Harris Street) continues northwest into the town to meet former Highway&nbsp;2.<ref name="2010 mapart" /><ref name="gmaps" />

== History ==
The history of Highway&nbsp;19 dates back to 1849, when the Baldwin Act and the Act to Authorize Formation of Joint Stock Companies were passed.<ref name="shragge">{{cite book

George Tillson, his sons and his brother-in-law Benjamin Van Norman were the principal stockholders of the Ingersoll and [[Port Burwell, Ontario|Port Burwell]] Road Company, which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in September&nbsp;1849. Proceeding quickly, the company established eight [[toll booth]]s along the new route, which became known as the ''Plank and Gravel Road'' due to the materials with which it was constructed.<ref name="tollroad">{{cite news

However, the greed of toll road operators resulted in diminishing upkeep, which forced the province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume ownership of the roads.<ref name="shragge" /> It took until 1907 for Oxford County to assume the toll road; the proprietors were compensated with $15,500 (${{inflation|CA|15,500|1916|r=-2|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation from 1916).<ref name="tollroad" />

The gradual implementation of various legislation over the following decade allowed many counties to vastly improve roads under their jurisdiction. By the time the Department of Highways (DHO) assumed the road from Highway&nbsp;3 in Tillsonburg to Highway&nbsp;2 in Ingersoll on March&nbsp;12, 1930 as King's Highway&nbsp;19, it was once again a [[gravel road]].<ref name="assumed">{{cite report

A year later, on May&nbsp;27, 1931, the highway was extended north from [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] to [[Shakespeare, Ontario|Shakespeare]]. As a result of this, a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with Highway&nbsp;2 was created between Ingersoll and Woodstock. Several months later, on July&nbsp;1, the department assumed the remainder of the Ingersoll to Port Burwell Road, extending Highway&nbsp;19 south of Tillsonburg.<ref>{{cite report

As part of a [[Great Depression|depression]] relief program, the DHO and Department of Labour undertook several projects in 1933 and 1934, one of which included the Stratford to Tralee Road. On July&nbsp;4, 1934, the DHO assumed the road as part of Highway&nbsp;19. To remedy the discontinuity, a {{convert|12|km|adj=on}} concurrency with [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]] was established.<ref>{{cite report

At this point, Highway&nbsp;19 had grown from its original length of {{convert|25.1|km}} to {{convert|148.4|km}}.<ref name="assumed" /><ref>{{cite map

The route remained unchanged until the early 1960s, when several highways were renumbered. Highway&nbsp;19 between Woodstock and Shakespeare was redesignated as [[Ontario Highway 59|Highway&nbsp;59]], while [[Ontario Highway 100|Highway 100]] between [[Thamesford, Ontario|Thamesford]] and [[St. Marys, Ontario|St. Marys]] was redesignated as Highway&nbsp;19. The concurrencies with Highway&nbsp;2 and Highway&nbsp;7 were relocated as a result of this renumbering; Highway&nbsp;19 became concurrent with Highway&nbsp;2 between Ingersoll and Thamesford, and with Highway&nbsp;7 between St. Marys and Stratford. While the length of the route was reduced insignificantly as a result of this renumbering, it became more direct.<ref name="1961map">{{cite map

Between then and 1997, no changes were made to Highway&nbsp;19. On April&nbsp;1, 1997, the section from Highway&nbsp;3 south to Port Burwell was [[Ontario highway transfers|transferred]] to [[Elgin County]], Oxford County and [[Haldimand County|Haldimand]]<U+2013>[[Norfolk County|Norfolk]].<ref name="downloaded">{{cite report

This was followed by a second round of transfers on January&nbsp;1, 1998, which resulted in the section north of Highway&nbsp;401 being decommissioned and assumed by Oxford County and [[Perth County, Ontario|Perth County]].<ref name="WDW">{{cite report

Today, the majority of the Port Burwell to Tillsonburg segment is designated as Elgin County Road&nbsp;19. A short segment in Haldimand<U+2013>Norfolk and Oxford County immediately south of Tillsonburg is designated as ''County Highway&nbsp;19''. The Ingersoll to St. Marys segment is now known as Oxford County Road&nbsp;119, while the segment north of Stratford is designated as Perth County Road&nbsp;119 through [[Brunner, Ontario|Brunner]], then Perth County Road&nbsp;131 through [[Milverton, Ontario|Milverton]].<ref name="2010 mapart" />
