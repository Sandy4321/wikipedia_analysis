'''Florida International University''', commonly referred to as '''FIU''' or '''Florida International''', is a [[public university|public]] [[research]] [[university]] whose  main campus is located in [[University Park, Florida|University Park]] in metropolitan [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]], in the [[United States]]. Florida International University is a Comprehensive Doctoral Research University with very high research activity as determined by the [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]]. Florida International University is also the youngest university to be awarded a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter by the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], the country's oldest academic [[honor society]]. FIU is one of only 78 universities nationwide to hold both designations.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/about_fiu.htm|title=About FIU<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> 

The university comprises 26 separate colleges and schools offering 205 programs of study with more than 280 [[Academic major|majors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://government.fiu.edu/06DidYouKnow.asp|title=FIU, Did You Know?|accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> Florida International University is also the fifth-largest university in Florida and the thirteenth-largest university in the [[United States]] in terms of enrollment. For the first academic quarter of [[2007]], total enrollment was 38,290 students and 2,974 full-time faculty with more than 150,500 [[alumni]] around the world.<ref name="qf">{{cite web|url=http://w3.fiu.edu/irdata/portal/quickfacts.htm|title=Quick Facts about FIU<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Florida International University is ranked among the top 100 [[public university|public national universities]] in [[Us news|U.S. News & World Report's]] "America's Best Colleges." FIU was the youngest institution in that group. U.S. News & World Report (2007) also ranks the Landon Undergraduate School of Business 7th in the nation and the [[Florida International University College of Business Administration|Chapman Graduate School of Business]] among the top 20 [[business school]]s in the United States for international business.<ref name="qf"/> 

In [[2006]] and [[2007]], the [[Florida International University College of Law]] consistently ranked 1st in the state of [[Florida]] with bar passing rates of 94%, and 1st in the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam at 96%.<ref name="law">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunethics.com/ba-results.htm|title=FIU Law School with highest passing rate in Florida<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

This recognition comes as the academic quality of the university improves and its admissions rates become more selective. As of 2007, Florida International University attracts more valedictorians from [[South Florida]] than any other university in the country. <ref name="valedictorians">{{cite web|url=http://news.fiu.edu/releases/best_in_class/valedictorians/pdf/Virginia2.indd2.pdf|title=FIU attracts more valedictorians from South Florida than any other university in the country<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Admission standards have also increased with acceptance rates dropping greatly from 63.2% for Fall 2005 to 37% for Fall 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/oir/fb05-06/adm_data.pdf|title=Freshmen admissions data<!--INSERT TITLE-->|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> The average incoming freshmen had a [[SAT]] score of 1144, a 24 [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] score and a 3.66 high school [[GPA]].<ref name="qf"/> 

==History==
===Founding: 1943-1969===
[[Image:IHRC FIU.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Meteorologists at work at FIU's [[FIU#International_Hurricane_Research_Center|International Hurricane Research Center]] in 1970.]]The founding of Florida International University began in 1943, when state Senator [[Ernest R. Graham (politician)|Ernest 'Cap' Graham]] (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator [[Bob Graham]]) presented the state legislature with the initial proposal for the establishment of a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of [[Miami]]'s need for a state university. He is recognized for his early awareness of the necessity of a public university to serve the city's growing population.<ref name="history2">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/brief_history2|title=History from 1943 to 1979<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref>

In 1964, Senate Bill 711 was introduced by Florida Senator Robert M. Haverfield; it instructed the state Board of Education and the [[Board of Regents]] (BOR), to begin planning for the development of a state university in Miami. The bill was signed into law by then-governor [[W. Haydon Burns]] in June 1965 and FIU was officially founded.

FIU's founding president [[Chuck Perry|Charles "Chuck" Perry]] was appointed by the Board of Regents in July 1969 after a nationwide search. At 31 years old, the new president was the youngest in the history of the State University System and, at the time, the youngest [[university president]] in the country. Perry recruited the three co-founders - Butler Waugh, Donald McDowell and Nick Sileo - who came to abandoned Tamiami Airport in the summer of 1969 and launched the monumental task of creating a new university. Alvah Chapman, former [[Miami Herald]] publisher and [[Knight Ridder]] chairman, used his civic standing and media power to assist the effort. In the 1980s, Chapman became chair of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees.<ref name="history2"/>

===Opening of the Doors: 1969-1975===
In September 1972, 5,667 students finally entered the new state university. Previously, Miami had been the largest city in the country lacking a public baccalaureate-granting institution. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now [[Miami-Dade College]]). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the [[University of Miami]] and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.<ref name="history2"/>

[[Image:FIU OE.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Green Library and Owa Ehan.]]

The first commencement, held in June 1973, was held in the reading room of the ground floor of Primera Casa (today called the Perry Building) - the only place large enough on campus for the ceremony. More than 1,500 family members and friends watched FIU's first class of 191 graduates receive their diplomas.<ref name="history2"/>

By late 1975, after seven years at the helm, [[Chuck Perry|Charles Perry]] felt he had accomplished his goal and left the University to become president and publisher of the Sunday newspaper magazine ''Family Weekly'' (now ''[[USA Weekend]]''), one of the country's largest magazines. When he left, there were over 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.<ref name="history2"/>

===Crosby and Wolfe: 1976-1986===
[[Harold Crosby]], the University's second president and the founding president of the [[University of West Florida]] in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], agreed in 1976 to serve a three-year "interim" term. Under his leadership, the North Campus (which was officially renamed the Biscayne Bay Campus in February of 1977) - located on the former Interama site on Biscayne Bay - was opened in 1977. State Senator [[Jack Gordon]] was instrumental in securing funding for the development of the campus. President Crosby was also insistent that the "I" in FIU be highlighted, which prompted the launching of new programs with an international focus and the recruitment of faculty from the Caribbean and Latin America. President Crosby's resignation in January 1979, triggered the search for a "permanent" president.<ref name="history3">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/brief_history3.htm|title=History from 1979 to 1986<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref>

[[Gregory Baker Wolfe]], a former United States diplomat and then-president of [[Portland State University]] became FIU's third president, from 1979 to 1986. After stepping down as president, Wolfe went on to teach in the university's [[International Relations]] department. The [[student activity center|student union]] on the Biscayne Bay Campus is named in his honor.<ref name="history3"/>

===FIU Today===
[[Image:FIU SOA.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Paul Cejas [[Florida International University School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] Building.]]
In 1986, [[Modesto Maidique]] became the fourth president of FIU, to become the longest-serving university president in the State of Florida. Under Modesto Maidique, FIU has grown immensely, becoming the largest university in [[South Florida]], with a student enrollment of 38,290, and a budget of over $586 million, creating an economic impact of more than $1.7 billion on the South Florida economy.<ref name="about"/><ref name="qf"/>

Having begun as a two-year upper division university serving the Miami area, FIU has grown into a traditional university serving students from all over the world. To strengthen this growth, more than $600 million have been invested in construction, with the addition of new residence halls, the on-campus [[FIU Stadium]], recreation center, student center, and Greek Life mansions, as well as fielding the Division I-A [[FIU Golden Panthers football|Golden Panthers football]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/oir/approved_doc_programs_and_20_year_data.xls|title=FIU growth and expansions<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> FIU has also increased its academic prestige with the founding of the [[Florida International University School of Architecture]], [[Florida International University College of Law]] and the [[Florida International University College of Medicine]], as well as the acquisition of the historical [[Wolfsonian-FIU|Wolfsonian-FIU Museum]] in [[Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/brief_history4.htm|title=History from 1986 to Today<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref><ref name="qf"/>

Florida International University also emphasizes research as a major component of its mission and sponsored research funding (grants and contracts) from external sources for the year 2005-2006 totaled $92 million.<ref name="qf"/> FIU is ranked as a Research University in the High Research Activity category of the Carnegie Foundation<U+2019>s prestigious classification system.<ref name="about"/><ref name="qf"/> FIU's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management is collaborating with [[China]]'s [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] to work on preparations for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

===University Park===
[[Image:FIU Campus.JPG|250px|right|thumb|View of the campus from Turtle Pond.]]
The main campus, University Park, encompasses 344&nbsp;acres (1.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in [[University Park, Florida|University Park]], (from where the campus derives its name), west of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. University Park houses all of the university's colleges and schools as well as all the administrative offices and main university facilities. University Park is also home to the Ronald W. Reagan Presidential House, the home of FIU's president, the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the [[Frost Art Museum]], the International Hurricane Research Center, and the university's athletic facilities such as [[FIU Stadium]], [[University Park Stadium]], and the [[Pharmed Arena]].

Until the early-1990s, aerial pictures of the campus clearly revealed the features of the airport that used to occupy the land until 1969. [[Construction]] has obliterated all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as memory of the university's past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/docs/fiuvideos/other1.html|title=History of FIU video<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> Today, University Park is home to about 87% of the student population and 94% of housing students. University Park is a lush, heavily-vegetated campus, with many lakes and nature preserves, as well as an arboretum and has 92 buildings. Current construction at University Park includes a Molecular Biology Building, an International Studies Building, Parking Garage V, and an expansion to [[FIU Stadium]] for a seating capacity of 45,000.

Located five blocks north of University Park, is the 38&nbsp;acre (145,000m<U+00B2>) [[Engineering Center]] which houses a part of the [[Florida International University College of Engineering and Computing|College of Engineering and Computing]] and is the home of FIU's [[Motorola]] [[Nanotechnology|Nanofabrication]] Research Facility. The Engineering Center is also serviced by the Golden Panther Express, FIU's student buses, which run throughout the day on weekdays connecting the two parts of campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cec.fiu.edu/CEC_About.htm|title=FIU Engineering Center<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref>

===Biscayne Bay Campus===
[[Image:Fiuarboretum.JPG|250px|right|thumb|FIU Arboretum, home to many rare species of plants and foliage.]]
The second largest campus is the [[Biscayne Bay Campus]] in [[North Miami]]. The Biscayne Bay Campus was opened in 1977 by [[Harold Crosby]] and is about 200&nbsp;acres (809,000&nbsp;m<U+00B2>), directly on the bay and adjacent to the [[Oleta River State Park]], with which FIU has a research partnership. Access to these resources inspired the creation of a [[marine biology]] program on the Biscayne Bay Campus, which has become one of the university's most recognized programs. The Biscayne Bay Campus also houses the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, one of the nation's top programs, the Aquatic Center, Bay Vista Hall, and the Kovens Conference Center. The Golden Panther Express, FIU's student buses, connect the main campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus throughout the day on weekdays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parking.fiu.edu/bus_schedule.htm|title=Golden Panther Express schedules<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

====Superstitions and legends====
There are many other traditions at FIU that are not spirit-related. The large [[cube]] in front of Deuxieme Maison is said to give good luck in exams and tests and thus is spun by hundreds of students every semester. During [[final exams]], a line forms around the cube with people waiting to be able to spin the cube for good luck on their exams. The "Kissing Bridge" tradition in Turtle Pond in between the Ryder Business Building and Green Library. The tradition is that if you kiss someone on the bridge you will stay with them forever. The "University Seal" tradition involves the engraved [[seal]] in front of the Graham Center, the university's student union. If a student steps on the seal, it is said that they will delay their graduation for many years, or never graduate at all, and thus even on crowded days, students go around the seal to avoid stepping on it, as a [[superstition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fiualumni.com/traditions.htm|title=FIU traditions<!--INSERT TITLE-->|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref>
