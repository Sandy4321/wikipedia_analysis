== Biography ==

'''Dominique Sorrente''' was born in [[Nevers]] (central [[France]]) in 1953.
He spent his childhood in various cities and regions of France: [[Marseille]], the [[Morvan]]<U+2019>s forests and the [[Vend<U+00E9>e]], on the Atlantic coast. After receiving a [[Jesuit]] education, he moved in 1970 to Aix-en-Provence where he began to write poetry passionately. In that year, he was 17 years old, he made several crucial contacts, notably with the mystic and mad (<U+00AB> po<U+00E8>te maudit <U+00BB>) poet, [[Christian Guez-Ricord]] (1948-1988) in whom he recognised his "older brother in poetry" and who was to have a lasting influence on his work. In 1975, in Paris, he founded the journal "Avalanche" which he edited for four years with the novelist, [[Michel Orcel]]. After studying Political Sciences and European Studies in [[Paris]], then in [[Bruges]] (Belgium), he returned to Marseille where he decided to devote himself to teaching, preserving precious time for writing.

His first book (''Citadelles et Mers'', 1978) was published by the well-known Mediterranean and International Review Sud. Later on, he became an influential member of the committee of Sud, being more and more involved in the destiny of this review until it disappeared in 1997. In 1982, a young editor living in the [[Haute-Loire]] (centre of France), Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Manier (Cheyne editions), accepted his manuscript ''La Lampe allum<U+00E9>e sur Patmos''. From then on, Cheyne was to become, for over twenty years, his principal publisher. 

Dominique Sorrente was elected laureate by the Marseille Academy in 1983, and "[[Guy Levis Mano]]" laureate in 1984; he subsequently received several literary Prizes: "[[Luc B<U+00E9>rimont]]", "[[Antonin Artaud]]" and "[[Louis Guillaume]]" as well as two grants from the Centre National du Livre (French Ministry of Culture). Later on, he became a member of different boards such as the Jean Malrieu Prize. Recently (June 2008) he received the Sainte-Victoire Prize in [[Aix-en-Provence]].
Currently, Dominique Sorrente has published some twenty books and anthologies, including a bilingual poetry collection, ''A Crayon for the Rainbow'' (Publibook, 2003). 

A new book was published in March 2007, called ''Mandala des jours'' (Publibook). 
Dominique Sorrente<U+2019>s writing has also been published in several journals, both in France and abroad. Poems have been translated into English, but also in German, Romanian, Italian, Chinese, and some other languages such as Proven<U+00E7>al<U+2026>
Besides his work as a poet, Dominique Sorrente tries to make contemporary poetry better known, particularly in High School and with University students. He thus currently gives regular readings, lectures and seminars in France and internationally (Prague, Venice, Marrakech, Naples<U+2026>). He participates regularly in literary events in France, such as the Printemps des Po<U+00E8>tes. In 2007, he was invited to the first <U+201C>Primavera dei poeti<U+201D> in Turin (Italy).

Two recent dates have been marked by significant events: 

- 1999 : a retrospective exhibition "Voix, po<U+00E8>me, encre & compagnie" dedicated to Dominique Sorrente and other collaborating artists (painters, musicians, sculptors, poets<U+2026>), organized in Aix-en-Provence by the [[Saint-John Perse Foundation]] created in honour of the Nobel Prize winner. This collective experience was unforgettable.

- 2006 : Dominique Sorrente was selected for an international Residence in Lavigny Castle (Switzerland) by the [[Ledig-Rowohlt Foundation]]. During this precious time, he had opportunities to organize international links among writers (becoming friends) with origins from many countries. His international interest could be developed by making translations and founding the bases for an international network among writers. In 2007, he was selected by L&Arc (%culturel Migros) for another great time in the international artists<U+2019> residence in the site of the abbey of [[Romainm<U+00F4>tier]] (Switzerland) where he returned in May 2008. 

All this experience has convinced Dominique Sorrente to take a special role in literary and 
creative life, as a go-between linking solitary experience and collective sharing. This idea is the basis of the foundation in 1999 (a symbolic date crossing the millennium) of a new initiative in poetry, called The [[Scriptorium]]. In a small sea harbour called the Vallon des Auffes, in Marseille, Dominique Sorrente chose to set up a new meeting-place for poetry. 
This movement is based on "intuitive poetry" and the desire to stimulate creative links among artists. With the rhythm of semaphore (a time for appearing / a time for vanishing<U+2026>), it seeks to promote all the resources of poetry in the heart of the city, through conferences, lectures and original experiences called: <U+201C>intervals<U+201D>, <U+201C>poetic caravans<U+201D>, <U+201C>literary meals<U+201D>, <U+201C>transcontinental events<U+201D><U+2026> An international seminar was held in May 2002 with writers coming from all around the world. For the [[Unesco]] International Poetry Day, the Scriptorium organized in 2008 the first edition of La Transcontinentale gathering poets of different continents.

As a socially active poet, Dominique Sorrente has also held a position as Professor in Culture and Humanities at the Euromed School of Management for the last twenty years and in different Graduate Schools in France. He bases his educational research on his central concern for creative management and poetry. He has taught European studies, Ethical Issues and Cultural Management. One of his favourite research themes is cross-cultural knowledge, in particularly the dialogue between Science and Art. 

At the moment, many projects for publishing are in hand: a personal Anthology, a bilingual book (''Heroes without a story''), texts for the stage (''Ad alta voce''), literature for young people (''Silence, we<U+2019>re on''), cooperating as a member of the committee of the review Les Archers (Toursky Theatre)<U+2026> He also has a special interest in collaborative work with other artists, painters and musicians, and he is planning projects for new events over the coming years.
Recently, he has started a very specific and exciting work to produce, with the photograph and painter, Daniel Vincent, a new concept of poetical DVD, called Pictodrama. This co-production will show short sequences, based on the voice reading a poem, and including worked images and sound. The objective of this work is to trigger a new and strong sensorial perception of poetry in life. The exact opposite to the zapping attitude<U+2026>
The first prototype of this project (Entracte 1: ''Lettre <U+00E0> une habitante en chemin'' <U+2013> <U+201C>''A missive to a pioneer denizen''<U+201D>) was screened at the Salon du Livre in Paris (March 2007).
