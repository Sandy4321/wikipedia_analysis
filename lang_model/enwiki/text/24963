'''State Route&nbsp;510''' (SR&nbsp;510) is a {{convert|13.07|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] in [[Thurston County, Washington|Thurston County]], a subdivision of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington]]. The highway extends southeast from an interchange with {{nowrap|[[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]]}} (I-5) in [[Lacey, Washington|Lacey]] to {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 507|SR 507]]}} in [[Yelm, Washington|Yelm]]. SR&nbsp;510 roughly parallels the [[Nisqually River]], the border between Thurston and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce]] counties, between the [[Fort Lewis]] and [[Nisqually Indian Community, Washington|Nisqually Indian Community]] area to Yelm. Five educational institutions, including one [[community college]] and two [[high schools]], are served by the route. The roadway was built by 1916 as a connector from [[Saint Clair Lake]] to the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] station in Yelm and was designated as '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;5I''' (SSH&nbsp;5I) in 1937. The original route of SSH&nbsp;5I ran from [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]] east to Yelm, following the present-day Yelm Highway. In 1959, the highway was realigned to serve a new freeway, later I-5, in Lacey; SSH&nbsp;5I was replaced in the [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]] by SR&nbsp;510. The [[Yelm-Tenino Trail]] was built over the Northern Pacific line in 1993 and a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] is being constructed around Yelm.
