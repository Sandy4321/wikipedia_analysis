On January 1, 1873, Japan adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Before 1873, the Chinese style [[lunisolar calendar]] had been in use since 7th century.<ref>{{cite web

 }}[ National Diet Library, Japan "The Japanese Calendar"-Calendar History 2]</ref>  [[Japanese era]]s are still in use.

==Official calendar==
Japan has refused to accept some elements of the [[Gregorian calendar]] itself. The present Japanese Solar calendar does not include following events:
* March 21 as the fixed Vernal Equinox Day
* [[Epact]]
* Sunday as religious [[Sabbath]]
* The [[leap year]] calculating system based on [[Anno Domini]]
Vernal equinox day is a national holiday in Japan and an important religious holiday in both [[Japanese Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]. But this holiday is determined completely on [[astronomy]]. The date of next year's this holiday is announced by [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]] every year, so the day is not fixed on the calendar.

Japanese official calendar has no relation with [[Easter]], therefore it does not include [[Epact]].

Sunday and Saturday are not regarded as religious Sabbath, but just "Western style take-a-rest days". Many Japanese retailers do not close on Saturdays or Sundays, because many office workers and their families are expected to visit the shops during the weekend. An old Japanese imperial [[navy]] song says "We have neither Sundays nor Saturdays!" which means "We work throughout the week."

Even now leap year in the Japanese solar calendar has still been legally determined based on [[k<U+014D>ki]] since 1899<ref><U+958F><U+5E74><U+30CB><U+95DC><U+30B9><U+30EB><U+4EF6> (Japanese Imperial [[Edict]] No.90, 11 May 1899)</ref>. But this law sets the number "k<U+014D>ki-660" to be the base of calculation, so the leap year calculation in Japanese solar calendar is completely aligned with that of the Gregorian calendar.

===Years===
Since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, three different systems for counting years have been used in Japan:
*The {{nihongo|imperial year|<U+7687><U+7D00>|k<U+014D>ki}} based on the mythical founding of Japan by [[Emperor Jimmu]] in 660 BC.
*The {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|<U+5E74><U+53F7>|neng<U+014D>}} based on the reign of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], the year {{currentyear}} being Heisei {{#expr:{{currentyear}}-1988}}
*The {{nihongo|European [[Common Era]] ([[Anno Domini]])|<U+897F><U+66A6>|''seireki''}} designation

Of these three, the last two are still in current use.

The imperial year system (k<U+014D>ki) was used from 1872 to the [[Second World War]]. Imperial year 1 (K<U+014D>ki 1) was the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan - 660 BC according to the Gregorian Calendar.  In terms of nationalism, k<U+014D>ki emphasizes the long history of Japan and the imperial family because it is a larger number than the [[Anno Domini]] year (AD). K<U+014D>ki 2600 (1940) was a special year. The [[1940 Summer Olympics]] and Tokyo Expo were planned as anniversary events, but were canceled due to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese aircraft [[Zero Fighter]] was named after this year. After the Second World War, the United States occupied Japan, and stopped the use of k<U+014D>ki by officials. Today, k<U+014D>ki is rarely used, except in some judicial contexts.

===Months===
====Common names====
The modern Japanese names for the months literally translate to "first month", "second month", and so on. The corresponding number is combined with the suffix -''gatsu'' ("month"):


In addition, every month has a traditional name, still used by some in fields such as [[poetry]]; of the twelve, ''shiwasu'' is still widely used today. The opening paragraph of a letter or the greeting in a speech might borrow one of these names to convey a sense of the season. Some, such as ''[[Yayoi (given name)|yayoi]]'' and ''[[satsuki]]'', do double duty as [[given name]]s (for women). These month names also appear from time to time on [[jidaigeki]], contemporary television shows and movies set in the [[Edo period]] or earlier.

The names of the months are as follows:
* 1st month: {{nihongo|mutsuki|<U+7766><U+6708>||"Month of Affection"}}<ref name="about.com old names">{{cite web

In this name the ''na'' is actually a possessive particle, so kaminazuki  means "month of the gods", not "month without gods" ("kaminakizuki"), similarly to minatsuki, the "month of water".<ref>Entries in the standard dictionaries Daijisen <U+5927><U+8F9E><U+6CC9><U+FF08>Sh<U+014D>gakukan <U+5C0F><U+5B66><U+9928>), Daijirin <U+5927><U+8F9E><U+6797>(Sanseid<U+014D> <U+4E09><U+7701><U+5802>), Nihon Kokugo Daijiten <U+65E5><U+672C><U+56FD><U+8A9E><U+5927><U+8F9E><U+5178> (Sh<U+014D>gakukan <U+5C0F><U+5B66><U+9928>).</ref>  However, by [[false etymology]] this became commonly interpreted to mean that because in that month  all the [[Shinto]] [[kami]] gather at [[Izumo Taisha|Izumo Shrine]] shrine in [[Izumo province]] (modern-day [[Shimane Prefecture]]), there are no gods in the rest of the country.  Thus in Izumo Province, the month is called {{nihongo|'''kamiarizuki'''|<U+795E><U+6709><U+6708> or <U+795E><U+5728><U+6708>||"month with gods"}}. This interpretation is the one commonly cited in western works.<ref>For example, {{cite book|title=Practically Religious: Worldly Benefits and the Common Religion of Japan|year=1998|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-2090-8|pages=178|coauthors=Ian Reader and George J.

* 11th month: {{nihongo|[[shimotsuki]]|<U+971C><U+6708>||"Month of Frost"}}<ref name="about.com old names"/>
* 12th month: {{nihongo|shiwasu|<U+5E2B><U+8D70>||"Priests Running"}}.  This is in reference to priests being busy at the end of the year for [[Shogatsu|New Year's]] preparations and blessings.<ref name="about.com old names"/>

'''Note:'''' the old Japanese calendar was an adjusted lunar calendar based on the Chinese calendar, and the year<U+2014>and with it the months<U+2014>started anywhere from about 3 to 7 weeks later than the modern year, so it is not entirely accurate to equate the first month with January.

===Subdivisions of the month===
Japan uses a [[seven-day week]], aligned with the Western calendar. The seven day week, with names for the days corresponding directly to those used in Europe, was brought to Japan around AD 800 with [[Buddhism]] calendar.  The system was used for astrological purposes and little else until 1876. Since late 19th century, Sunday has been regarded as a "full-time holiday", and Saturday a "half-time holiday<U+FF08><U+534A><U+30C9><U+30F3><U+FF09>". These holidays have no religious meaning (except those who believe [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] or [[Islam]]). The names come from the five visible planets, which in turn are named after the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five Chinese elements]] (gold, wood, water, fire, earth), and from the moon and sun ([[yin and yang]]).  On the origin of the names of the days of the week, also see [[Week-day_names#East_Asian_Seven_Luminaries|East Asian Seven Luminaries]].

Japanese people also use 10-day periods called "Jun<U+FF08><U+65EC><U+FF09>". Each month is divided roughly into three 10-day periods. The first (from 1st to 10th day) is "j<U+014D>jun" (<U+4E0A><U+65EC> "upper Jun"); the second(from 11th to 20th), ''ch<U+016B>jun'' (<U+4E2D><U+65EC> "middle Jun"); the last(from 21st to 31st), ''gejun'' (<U+4E0B><U+65EC> "bottom Jun" ). These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, "the temperatures are typical of the ''j<U+014D>jun'' of April"; "a vote on a bill is expected during the ''gejun'' of this month."

===Days of the month===
Each day of the month has a semi-systematic but irregularly formed name:

(Note that using Arabic numerals, as 14<U+65E5>, is extremely common in everyday communication, almost the norm.)

"Tsuitachi" is a worn-down form of ''tsuki-tachi'', which means "the month beginning". The last day of the month was called "tsugomori", which means "Moon hidden". This classic word comes from the tradition of lunisolar calendar.
The 30th day of the month was also called "misoka" just as 20th day called "hatsuka". Nowadays, the terms for the numbers 28-31 plus ''nichi'' are much more common. However, ''misoka'' is much used in contracts, etc., specifying that a payment should be made on or by the last day of the month, whatever the number is. The last day of the year is <U+5927><U+6666><U+65E5> ''[[<U+014D>misoka]]'' (the ''big 30th day''), and that term is still in use.

There is a tradition to use a term ''kichijitsu'' (good day) for ceremonial events such as the preparation day of a wedding invitation letter and the build day of a memorial stone tablet. It is, however, not recognized as a legally valid date indication. So, for example, a will with ''kichijitsu'' as its preparation date is not legally valid.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}

=== National holidays ===<!-- This section is linked from November 23 -->
{{Main|Holidays of Japan}}
After WW2, names of Japanese national holidays were completely changed because of the secular state principle (Article 20, The Constitution of Japan). Although many of them are actually originated from [[Shinto]], [[Buddhism]] and some important events of Japanese imperial family, it is not easy to understand the original meaning from its superficial and vague official name.

Notes: Single days between two national holidays are taken as a bank holiday. This applies to May 4, which is a holiday each year. When a national holiday falls on a Sunday the next day that is not a holiday (usually a Monday) is  taken as a holiday.

== Customary issues in modern Japan ==
=== Gregorian months and the "One Month Delay"===
Clearly in contrast to other East Asian countries such as [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]] and [[Mongolia]], Japan has almost completely forgotten the [[Chinese calendar]]. Since 1876, January is officially regarded as the "first month" even when setting the date of every Japanese traditional [[folklore]] event (other months are the same: February as the second month, March as the third, and so on). But this system often brings strong seasonal sense of gap. The modern Japanese culture invented a kind of "compromised" calendar. This calendar, which is called "Tsuki-okure (One Month Delay)" or "Ch<U+016B>reki(The Eclectic Calendar"), regards February as "1st Month". Although this is just de facto and customary, it is broadly used when setting the dates of many folklore events and religious festivals. But [[Japanese New Year]] is the great exception. This festival is never set on February 1.

=== Seasonal days ===
Some days have special names to mark the change in seasons. The {{nihongo|[[Jieqi|24 Sekki]]|<U+4E8C><U+5341><U+56DB><U+7BC0><U+6C17>|Nij<U+016B>shi sekki}} are days that divide the solar year into twenty four equal sections. {{nihongo|Zassetsu|<U+96D1><U+7BC0>}} is a collective term for the seasonal days other than the 24 Sekki. {{nihongo|72 K<U+014D>|<U+4E03><U+5341><U+4E8C><U+5019>|Shichij<U+016B>ni k<U+014D>}} days are made from dividing the 24 Sekki of a year further by three. These were named based upon the climate of Northern [[China]], so many of the names do not fit in with the climate of Japanese archipelago. But some of these names, such as Shunbun, Rissh<U+016B> and T<U+014D>ji, are still used quite frequently in everyday life in Japan.

Shanichi days can vary as much as <U+00B1>5 days.
Ch<U+016B>gen has a fixed day. All other days can vary by <U+00B1>1 day.

Many zassetsu days occur on multiple seasons:
* {{nihongo|Setsubun|<U+7BC0><U+5206>}} refers to the day before each season, or the eves of Risshun, Rikka, Rish<U+016B>, and Ritt<U+014D>; especially the eve of Risshun.

* {{nihongo|Doy<U+014D>|<U+571F><U+7528>}} refers to the 18 days before each season, especially the one before fall which is known as the hottest period of a year.

* {{nihongo|Higan|<U+5F7C><U+5CB8>}} is the seven middle days of spring and autumn, with Shunbun at the middle of the seven days for spring, Sh<U+016B>bun for fall.

* {{nihongo|Shanichi|<U+793E><U+65E5>}} is the {{nihongo|Tsuchinoe|<U+620A>}} day closest to Shunbun (middle of spring) or Sh<U+016B>bun (middle of fall), which can be as much as  -5 to +4 days away from Shunbun/Sh<U+016B>bun.

===Seasonal festivals===
The following are known as the five seasonal festivals (<U+7BC0><U+53E5> ''sekku'', also <U+4E94><U+7BC0><U+53E5> ''go sekku''). The Sekku were made official holidays during [[Edo era]] on Chinese [[lunisolar calendar]]. The dates of these festivals are confused nowadays. Some on the Gregorian calendar, others on "Tsuki-okure".

# 7th day of the 1st Month: <U+4EBA><U+65E5> (''Jinjitsu''), <U+4E03><U+8349><U+306E><U+7BC0><U+53E5> (''[[Nanakusa no sekku]]'') held on 7 January today
# 3rd day of the 3rd Month: <U+4E0A><U+5DF3> (''J<U+014D>shi''), <U+6843><U+306E><U+7BC0><U+53E5> (''Momo no sekku'') held on 3 March in many area, but in some area on 3 April
#: <U+96DB><U+796D><U+308A> (''[[Hinamatsuri|Hina matsuri]]''), Girls' Day.
# 5th day of the 5th Month: [[Double Fifth|Tango]] (<U+7AEF><U+5348>): mostly held on 5 May
#* <U+7AEF><U+5348><U+306E><U+7BC0><U+53E5> (''[[Tango no sekku]]''), <U+83D6><U+84B2><U+306E><U+7BC0><U+53E5> (''[[Ayame no sekku]]'')
#* Boys' Day. Overlaps with the national holiday [[Children's Day]].
# 7th day of the 7th Month: <U+4E03><U+5915> (''Shichiseki'', ''[[Tanabata]]''), <U+661F><U+796D><U+308A> (''[[Hoshi matsuri]] '') held on 7 July in many areas, but in northern Japan held on 7 August(e.g. in [[Sendai]])
# 9th day of the 9th Month: <U+91CD><U+967D> (''Ch<U+014D>y<U+014D>''), <U+83CA><U+306E><U+7BC0><U+53E5> (''[[Kiku no sekku]]'') almost out of vogue today

Not Sekku:
* January 1: [[Japanese New Year]]
* August 15: [[Obon]] - the date is "Tsuki-okure". In central [[Tokyo]] Obon is held on July 15 (The local culture of Tokyo tends to dislike Tsuki-okure custom.)
* December 31: [[<U+014C>misoka]]

===''Rokuy<U+014D>''===
The {{nihongo|''rokuy<U+014D>''|<U+516D><U+66DC>}} are a series of six days calculated from the date of [[Chinese calendar]] that supposedly predict whether there will be good or bad fortune during that day.  The ''rokuy<U+014D>'' are commonly found on Japanese calendars and are often used to plan weddings and funerals, though most people ignore them in ordinary life. The ''rokuy<U+014D>'' are also known as the {{nihongo|''rokki''|<U+516D><U+8F1D>}}.  In order, they are:

{| class="wikitable"
! Kanji
! Romanization
! Meaning
|-
| <U+5148><U+52DD>
| Sensh<U+014D>
| Good luck before noon, bad luck after noon. Good day for beginnings (in the morning).
|-
| <U+53CB><U+5F15>
| Tomobiki
| Bad things will happen to your friends.  Funerals avoided on this day (''tomo'' = friend, ''biki'' = pull, thus a funeral might pull friends toward the deceased). Typically crematoriums are closed this day.
|-
| <U+5148><U+8CA0>
| Senbu
| Bad luck before noon, good luck after noon.
|-
| <U+4ECF><U+6EC5>
| Butsumetsu
| Symbolizes the day [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] died. Considered the most unlucky day{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.  Weddings are best avoided. Some [[Shinto]] shrines close their offices on this day.
|-
| <U+5927><U+5B89>
| Taian
| The most lucky day.  Good day for weddings and events like shop openings.
|-
| <U+8D64><U+53E3>
| Shakk<U+014D>
| The hour of the horse (11 am<U+2013>1 pm) is lucky.  The rest is bad luck.
|-
|}

The ''rokuy<U+014D>'' days are easily calculated from the Japanese Lunisolar calendar. Lunisolar January 1 is always ''sensh<U+014D>'', with the days following in the order given above until the end of the month. Thus, January 2 is ''tomobiki'', January 3 is ''senbu'', and so on. Lunisolar February 1 restarts the sequence at ''tomobiki''. Lunisolar March 1 restarts at ''senbu'', and so on for each month. The last six months repeat the patterns of the first six, so July 1 = ''sensh<U+014D>'', December 1 is ''shakk<U+014D>'' and the moon-viewing day of "August 15th" is always a "butsumetsu."

This system did not become popular in Japan until the end of the Edo period.

===April 1===
The first day of April has broad significance in Japan. It marks the beginning of the government's fiscal year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jircas.affrc.go.jp/english/publication/annual/2002/169.pdf |title=THE JAPANESE FISCAL YEAR AND MISCELLANEOUS DATA |accessdate=2007-10-08 |year=2003 |format=PDF |publisher=Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences }}</ref> Many corporations follow suit. In addition, corporations often form or merge on that date. In recent years, municipalities have preferred it for mergers. On this date, many new employees begin their jobs, and it is the start of many real-estate leases. The school year begins on April 1. (For more see also [[academic term]].)
