'''Cape Poge Light''' sometimes called '''Cape Pogue Light''' is at the northeast tip of [[Chappaquiddick]], an island near [[Martha's Vineyard]] off the coast of [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]]. 

At least four towers have been built at this location, with many moves. In [[1801]] the first 35-foot wooden Cape Poge Lighthouse was built for $2,000; during the [[War of 1812]] the light was extinguished for a few months and its apparatus was hidden in the cellar of a Chappaquiddick house. This first lighthouse was moved in [[1825]] and again in 1838 due to an eroding bluff. 

In [[1844]] a new tower was built for $1,600 and in [[1857]] supplied with a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]]. However, in [[1878]] it was reported that the keeper's house would probably "fall into the sea within two years." A third lighthouse was therefore built in [[1880]], and in [[1893]] a new, 35-foot, white, wooden, conical tower was added, 40 feet inland from the previous one. This 1893 tower has been moved four times (in [[1907]], [[1922]], [[1960]], and in [[1987]] when it became the first lighthouse to be moved by [[helicopter]]). The light was automated in [[1934]]. The light was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1987.

The current light is a 300mm solar powered beacon that flashes white every 6 seconds and is visible for 9 nautical miles. The light's focal plane is 65 feet above mean high water. This light is currently active and is under the auspices of the [[United States Coast Guard]], however the tower has been transferred and is now owned and operated by [[The Trustees of Reservations]]. The Trustees of Reservations provide tours during the summer season. The lighthouse can be reached via a 3.5-mile hike from the Dike Bridge or by four-wheel drive vehicle.
