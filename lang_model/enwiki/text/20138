'''''Andreacarus voalavo''''' is a [[parasitic]] [[mite]] found on the [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] rodent ''[[Voalavo gymnocaudus]]''. First described in 2007, it is closely related to ''[[Andreacarus gymnuromys]]'' and ''[[Andreacarus eliurus]]'', which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body is 630 to 670&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+03BC>m]] in females and 450 to 480&nbsp;<U+03BC>m in males. Unlike ''A.&nbsp;eliurus'', this species lacks distinct [[sternal gland]]s (secretory organs) between two [[lyrifissure]]s (sensory organs) on the lower part of the female body. The ''[[pilus dentilis]]'', a sensory organ on the [[chelicera]], is serrate, which distinguishes it from ''A.&nbsp;gymnuromys''. Females of ''A.&nbsp;gymnuromys'' also have a less ornamented [[sternal shield]] (covering part of the underparts) and shorter [[setae]] (bristles) on the upperparts.

==Taxonomy and range==
''Andreacarus voalavo'' was named in 2007 by Ashley Dowling, Andre Bochkov, and Barry OConnor on the basis of 15&nbsp;specimens found on an individual of the rodent ''[[Voalavo gymnocaudus]]'' that was collected in 1994 in the [[Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve]] in northern Madagascar. The [[specific name]] is taken from the [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] of the [[type host]].{{Sfn|Dowling|Bochkov|OConnor|2007|p=413}} ''Voalavo gymnocaudus'', the only known host, is only found in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and [[Marojejy]] massifs of the Malagasy [[Northern Highlands]].{{Sfn|Musser|Carleton|2005|p=953}} ''A.&nbsp;voalavo'' is closely related to ''[[Andreacarus gymnuromys]]'' and ''[[Andreacarus eliurus]]'', found on other Malagasy rodents.{{Sfn|Dowling|Bochkov|OConnor|2007|pp=410, 413}} They are members of the genus ''[[Andreacarus]]'', which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa.{{Sfn|Dowling|Bochkov|OConnor|2007|loc=table 1}}

==Description==
In the female, the ''[[pilus dentilis]]'', a sensory organ on the [[chelicera]] (mouthpart), is serrate, not smooth as in ''A.&nbsp;gymnuromys''. The idiosoma (main part of the body) is 630 to 670&nbsp;<U+03BC>m long and 370 to 435&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655&nbsp;<U+03BC>m long and 360 to 370&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide. The dorsal [[setae]] (bristles) are long relative to ''A.&nbsp;gymnuromys''. The [[sternal shield]] (on the lower side of the body) is 115 to 125&nbsp;<U+03BC>m long and 184 to 200&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide and is more ornamented than in ''A.&nbsp;gymnuromys''.{{Sfn|Dowling|Bochkov|OConnor|2007|p=413}} Unlike ''A.&nbsp;eliurus'', ''A.&nbsp;voalavo'' lacks distinct [[sternal gland]]s (secretory organs) between the [[lyrifissure]]s (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the [[genitoventral shield]] (232 to 253 by 170 to 182&nbsp;<U+03BC>m), the [[peritrematic shield]] (140 to 147 by 117 to 127&nbsp;<U+03BC>m), and the [[anal shield]] (140 to 147 by 117 to 127&nbsp;<U+03BC>m). On the soft part of the [[cuticle]], there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.{{Sfn|Dowling|Bochkov|OConnor|2007|p=410}}

The idiosoma of the male is 450 to 480&nbsp;<U+03BC>m long and 270 to 300&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide, the dorsal shield is 440 to 475 by 250 to 270&nbsp;<U+03BC>m, and the [[holoventral shield]] is 360 to 395&nbsp;<U+03BC>m and 189 to 207&nbsp;<U+03BC>m wide.{{Sfn|Dowling|Bochkov|OConnor|2007|p=410}}
