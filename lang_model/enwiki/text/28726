"'''I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Britney Spears]] for her third studio album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001). It was written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], with additional writing from [[Dido (singer)|Dido]]. The song was released on February 18, 2002, by [[Jive Records]]. In the United States and Canada, the song was released as the second single from her third studio album ''Britney''; internationally, it served as the third. "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" is a song which speaks about the angst and heartache of puberty. Spears considered the song inspirational and one of her favorite songs to perform.

"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" received positive reviews from [[music critics]]. The song was considered to be Spears' standout statement on ''Britney'', while comparing the song to the powerful ballads written by [[Diane Warren]]. However, it won the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song]]. While the song did not perform well in the United States, "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" reached the top ten in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Sweden and United Kingdom. An accompanying [[music video]] for the song was filmed at [[Antelope Canyon]], [[Arizona]] and directed by [[Wayne Isham]], being released along with ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002), Spears' first movie as a protagonist. Spears performed "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" as part of her [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], and on several TV shows.

==Background==
In early 2001, Spears and her team developed a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. "I talked to [Rhimes] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," Spears said. "It was my little project. When you do a movie, I think you have to be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into."<ref name="mtv">{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1450525/britneys-heart-into-crossroads.jhtml | title=Britney's heart into 'Crossroads,' outtakes from flick appear on Britney | author=Corey Moss| work=''[[MTV News]]'' | publisher=[[Viacom]] | date=November 6, 2001 | accessdate=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled [[Crossroads (2002 film)|''Crossroads'']], had the [[working title]]s of ''What Are Friends For'' and ''Not a Girl''.<ref name="mtv"/> "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by [[Dido (singer)|Dido]], [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third [[studio album]], ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001).<ref name="tsc">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626612/20091118/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Declared Her Independence With 'I'm Not A Girl' Video

"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" received positive reviews from [[music critics]].

==Music video==
The accompanying [[music video]] for the track was directed by [[Wayne Isham]], who wanted it to show Spears "out in nature". The video was filmed completely on location, with none of the scenes shot on [[green screen]]s. The video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing [[cowboy boot]]s, performing the song whilst standing on the edge of a cliff, and inside a cave: despite her "trepidation" and heavy winds which "almost dropped [her] over", she performed the scene without a [[safety harness|safety cable]].<ref name="tsc"/> Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she "had not a blink of fear" during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs.<ref name="tsc"/> Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had "nothing but positive things to say about my experience with her and what she's doing right now" and that Spears "stepped into it with positive energy. She ended up stepping out and kicking ass, There are 3 versions of the video, Version 1 and 2 has clips from the movie "Crossroads" and Version 3 is the original version."<ref name="tsc"/> The music video won the award for "International Music Video of the Year Short-Form" on the 2003 [[Japan Gold Disc Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/2003.html|year=2003|accessdate=August 21, 2011|title=The 17th Japan Gold Disc Award 2003|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050409174837/http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/2003.html|archivedate=April 9, 2005}}</ref>
