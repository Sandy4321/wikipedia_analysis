'''Pierre Emmanuel Vidal-Naquet''' ([[Paris]], [[July 23]] [[1930]] - [[Nice]], [[July 29]], [[2006]]) was a [[France|French]] [[historian]], teacher at the ''[[Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales]]'' (EHESS) since 1969. Specialized on [[Ancient Greece]], he was also concerned by contemporary history, in particular by the [[Algerian War]] (1954-62), during which he opposed the systematic use of [[torture]] by the [[French Army]], and also in [[Jewish history]]. After having participated, along with [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Marie Domenach]], in the founding of the ''[[Groupe d'information sur les prisons]]'' (GIP), one of the first French [[new social movement]]s, he criticized [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]]. Vidal-Naquet, who never abandoned his fascination for Antiquity, was also a supporter of [[:Category:Middle East peace efforts|Middle East peace efforts]].

== Biography ==

Pierre Vidal-Naquet's family came from the Jewish community living in the [[Comtat Venaissin]] ([[Carpentras]], [[Avignon]]), and he was raised in a [[Republicanism|Republican]] and [[laicit<U+00E9>|laic]] environment. His father Lucien was a "[[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfusard]]" lawyer, who quickly entered the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in order to avoid [[exile]]. In June 1940, the family escaped to [[Marseille]]. Arrested by the [[Gestapo]] on May 15, 1944, Vidal-Naquet's father was [[Holocaust|deported]], along with his wife, in [[June 1944]]. Sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], they never came back. At 14 years old, Pierre Vidal-Naquet then hid in his grand-mother's house in the [[Dr<U+00F4>me]]. There, he read a lot, including the ''[[Iliad]]'', and came to know his cousin, the philosopher [[Jacques Brunschwig]]. He later learnt that the [[Nazi]]s had made "his father dance", something he would never forget.

After his studies at the lyc<U+00E9>e Carnot in Paris, he specialized in the history of [[Ancient Greece]], as well as in contemporary subjects such as the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954-1962) or the [[Holocaust]]. He read [[Marc Bloch]]'s ''[[Strange Defeat]]'', a book attempting to explain the causes of the defeat during the 1940 [[Battle of France]], which is one of the origins of his vocation as a historian. He discovered [[surrealism]] ([[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Char]] and also [[Antonin Artaud]]), and founded a review at 18 years old, along with [[Pierre Nora]], ''Imprudence''. The 1949 [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Rajk|Rajk trial]] definitively took out his will to adhere to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF).

Pierre Vidal-Naquet first taught history at [[Orl<U+00E9>ans]]'s high school (1955), before going to [[Caen]]'s university (1956-60) and then [[Lille]] (1961-62). Reading [[Georges Dum<U+00E9>zil|Dum<U+00E9>zil]] and [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss|L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]], he would become a member of the "Paris School", composed at first of his friend [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] (with whom he wrote several books), [[Nicole Loraux]], [[Marcel Detienne]] and himself. Their work would renew the traditional vision of Ancient Greece.

He then worked at the [[CNRS]] (1962-64) and was named ''ma<U+00EE>tre de conf<U+00E9>rences'' at [[Lyon]]'s university (1964-66). He was then named professor at the ''[[Ecole pratique des hautes <U+00E9>tudes]]'', which became the EHESS. 

A friend of [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]], he wrote several books with him. However, although Vernant was a "comrade" of the PCF, Vidal-Naquet never took membership in any political party, with the exception of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU), which he considered as a "simple discussion circle" <ref> [http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060730.WWW000000033_le_dernier_des_dreyfusards.html "Le Dernier des dreyfusards"], article on Vidal-Naquet in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[September 6]], [[2004]] </ref>.

Pierre Vidal-Naquet was married and the father of three children. He was also officer of the ''[[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]'' and, in Greece, commander of the [[Phenix Order]]. His death was [http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/2006/07/0763.php announced]on the [[CLASSICS-L]] [[mailing list]] on [[July 29]], [[2006]].

== Activism ==

Pierre Vidal-Naquet defined himself as an "activist historian", and while pursuing his studies never ceased engaging in political struggles and taking part in political committees, etc. A member of the [[Comit<U+00E9> Audin]], along with [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Lindon]] (editor of the [[Editions de Minuit|Minuit publishing house]]), he was one of the best known opponents of the systematic use of torture during the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954-62). Along with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many others, he signed the ''[[Manifeste des 121]]'', a call for [[civil disobedience]] against the Algerian war. [[Anti-colonialist]], Vidal-Naquet was opposed to [[Guy Mollet]]'s [[SFIO]] (French Section of the Second International) reformist party because of Mollet's support of the colonial wars.
 
He was also opposed to the [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967-74) in Greece. He supported peace efforts in the Middle East as well as the [[Europalestine]] group. He thus declared: "I consider [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] as a criminal" <ref> [http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060730.WWW000000033_le_dernier_des_dreyfusards.html "Le Dernier des dreyfusards"], article on Vidal-Naquet in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[September 6]], [[2004]] </ref>. 

With [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Marie Domenach]], he signed on [[February 8]], [[1971]], the manifest on the ''[[Groupe d'informations sur les prisons]]'' ("Group of Information on Prison"), destined to give back discourse to the prisoners themselves, instead of talking in their name, as in the classic [[intellectual]] stance.  

Vidal-Naquet was also one of the first scholars to deconstruct [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]]'s thesis, most notably in his book ''The Assassins of Memory'' and ''Reflexions on [[Genocide]]''. He was also opposed to the [[February 23]], [[2005]] [[French law on colonialism]] voted by the conservative [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], but which was finally repealed by president [[Jacques Chirac]] himself in the beginnings of 2006; Vidal-Naquet also criticized the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] which prohibits revisionist discourse, claiming that the law shouldn't interfere in historical matters <ref> [http://www.ldh-toulon.net/article.php3?id_article=632 Interview with Vidal-Naquet] on the [[Human Rights League]] (LDH) website {{fr icon}} </ref>. Vidal-Naquet's arguments against legislation relating to historical studies is not, however, a door opened to negationist speech. He once declared that he would rather name revisionists "negationists", and that he wouldn't discuss with them for "simple and scientific reasons. An astronomer doesn't debate with an astrologer. I wouldn't discuss with someone who supports the idea that the moon is made of [[Roquefort]] [a type of French cheese]... it is impossible." <ref> [http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1990-06-07/1990-06-07-799024 "Au service du racisme"], in ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', [[June 7]], [[1990]]  </ref>
