The '''Tenth Doctor''' is the tenth [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|incarnation]] of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|protagonist]] of the long-running [[BBC]] [[Science fiction on television|television science-fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. He is played by [[David Tennant]], who appears in three series, as well as eight specials. As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' multimedia]].

In the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old [[Time Lord]] alien from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who [[Time travel in fiction|travels in time]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]]. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. Tennant portrays the tenth such incarnation. This incarnation's companions have included [[working class]] shop assistant [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), medical student [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]) and fiery [[temporary work|temp worker]] [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]);  he eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale, "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", after which he attempted to travel alone for the duration of the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Specials (2008<U+2013>10)|2008-10 specials]].

==Overview==
Executive producer [[Russell T Davies]] revived ''Doctor Who'' after a sixteen year absence with the successful premiere of "[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]", in 2005. Following the BBC's announcement of a second series being commissioned, the story broke that [[Christopher Eccleston]], who played the titular [[Ninth Doctor]], would not be returning for the second series. On 16 April 2005, the BBC announced that David Tennant had been selected for the role of the Tenth Doctor.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Tennant is tenth Doctor Who |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-04-16 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/16/tennant.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> His first appearance in the series was for 20 seconds following the Ninth Doctor's regeneration at the end of "[[The Parting of the Ways]]". His first full episode as the Doctor, barring an appearance in a "[[Doctor Who: Children in Need|mini-episode]]" during the 2005 [[Children in Need]] show, was the 2005 Christmas Special, "[[The Christmas Invasion]]". He then appeared in the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 2 (2006)|2006 series]], the second [[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|seasonal episode]], the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 3 (2007)|2007 series]], the third [[Voyage Of The Damned (Doctor Who)|Christmas special]], and the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 4 (2008) and beyond|2008 series]]. Rather than a traditional series run, 2009 features a series of five specials and a series of animated shorts, all starring Tennant as the Tenth Doctor; he also guest-starred in a [[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith|two-episode serial]] of ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' spin-off in that year. Tennant also appears in two animated serials; ''[[The Infinite Quest]]'' is counted with the third series, and ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' is counted amongst the 2008-10 specials. The 'Tenth Doctor era', in this article, refers to the period of ''Doctor Who'' in which David Tennant held the role of the Doctor. It is largely the same  as the "Russell T Davies era" of ''Doctor Who'', but excludes Christopher Eccleston stories, and places more emphasis on events within the show as opposed to those behind the scenes.

==Personality==
{{ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
The Tenth Doctor generally displays a light-hearted, talkative, easy-going, witty and cheeky manner, but repeatedly demonstrates a vengeful and unforgiving streak as well. This emerged early on when he sends the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax leader]] (who is attacking him from behind) falling to his death while commenting that, with him, there are "no second chances".<ref name="christmasinvasion">{{cite episode | title = [[The Christmas Invasion]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T. Davies]], Director [[James Hawes]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2005-12-25}}</ref> In "[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]", he acknowledges that he is less merciful than he used to be and has stuck to his "one warning" code, punishing his enemies if they persist in their hostilities. This is demonstrated in "[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]" when he drowns the Empress of [[List_of_Doctor_Who_monsters_and_aliens#Racnoss|Racnoss']] children, prompting [[Donna Noble]] to declare that he needs somebody to stop him, and in "[[The Family of Blood]]" where he gives each Family member an individual and eternal punishment. His strong personal sense of justice makes him quick to anger when he feels it is violated, as in "[[New Earth]]" when he learns of the plague farm run by the Sisters of Plenitude, and after Prime Minister [[Harriet Jones]] gives the order to destroy the retreating Sycorax ship, bringing down her government. In "[[The Waters of Mars]]", he goes so far as to declare himself above the laws of time, although there are catastrophic consequences as a result. This is coupled, however, with an intense sense of regret of the deaths of both his friends and enemies. In "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", he has a flashback of those who have died instead of/for him, including [[Astrid Peth]], [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]], [[Luke Rattigan]], [[Bad Wolf|Lynda Moss]], and the stewardess from "[[Midnight (Doctor Who)|Midnight]]". He also offers Davros the chance to escape the destruction of the Dalek mothership, but Davros spits the chance back at him, calling him the "Destroyer of Worlds". A recurring line on the part of the Tenth Doctor is his saying that he is "so sorry" for actions he takes, even as he takes them.

The Tenth Doctor has a tendency to babble, mixing apparent nonsense with vital information, sometimes acting erratically to put his enemies off guard. He is prone to making comments that to outsiders seem obtuse or rude, sometimes to his own embarrassment. In "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" and "[[Tooth and Claw]]", he is surprised at his own unintentional rudeness when making disparaging remarks, and [[Jack Harkness]], after reuniting with the Doctor, notes that his "new regeneration (is) kinda cheeky".<ref name="utopia">{{cite episode | title = [[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T. Davies]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2007-06-16}}</ref> He has a tendency to use [[technobabble]] to describe scientific concepts before substituting it with a simpler, analogous explanation, such as his description of non-linear temporal physics as "a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff".<ref name="blink">{{cite episode | title = [[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Steven Moffat]], Director [[Hettie MacDonald]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref> He is also able to rapidly switch between moods, from mania to anger to nonchalance and uses this as a form of [[reverse psychology]] on several occasions ("[[Fear Her]]", "[[Love & Monsters]]" and "[[Army of Ghosts]]"). In the latter, by switching gears suddenly after failing to dissuade Yvonne Hartman from her current activities, he is able to make her uncertain enough to get his way.

Another recurring theme in the Tenth Doctor's stories is that of his intense loneliness. In "School Reunion", he describes the ability of Time Lords to live so long as a curse, because while his human companions all someday leave him and eventually die, he continues to live. Other characters have also commented on the Tenth Doctor's loneliness. During a conversation with his nemesis, [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], he admits that since the end of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] and the loss of the other Time Lords, he has been "alone ever since". Indeed, when the Master subsequently dies, the Doctor openly weeps over his body. In "[[The End of Time]]", he ultimately ends up regenerating in the TARDIS alone despite visits to his past companions in his dying hours.

The Tenth Doctor is more extroverted and gregarious then his predecessor, quickly establishing a firmer rapport with Rose Tyler's friends and family than he ever did in his previous incarnation. He is openly fond of mankind and is apparently in awe of their tenacity and curiosity, a trait previously exhibited by his [[Fourth Doctor|fourth incarnation]]. In "[[The Impossible Planet]]", he hugs the leader of an Earth expedition for daring to explore a planet orbiting a [[black hole]] "because it's there". In "[[The Age of Steel]]", he describes human beings as both brilliant and stupid in the same sentence while arguing the necessity of emotions with the [[List of Doctor Who villains#John Lumic|Cyber-Controller]]. The Doctor even goes so far as to exclaim he's willing to battle the Master across the cosmos as long as he leaves Earth alone in "The Sound of Drums". However, he is also quick to criticise mankind when he feels it is necessary.<ref name="fortytwo">{{cite episode | title = [[42 (Doctor Who)|42]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Chris Chibnall]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> Indeed, his confidence in the human race becomes far less pronounced in later series, and at the end of "[[Midnight (Doctor Who)|Midnight]]" he is left speechless after witnessing the steps humans can become willing to take when placed in a threatening situation; almost being killed by a panicky group of people who turn on him.

The 2006 series continued the exploration of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#The Doctor and romance|Doctor's romantic aspects]], with the Tenth Doctor sharing kisses with Rose (albeit while she was possessed by [[Lady Cassandra]]) and [[Madame de Pompadour]]. In "School Reunion", [[Sarah Jane Smith]] all but confesses that she had been in love with him. In "Doomsday", during their farewell, Rose tells the Doctor she loves him; he begins to reply but only manages to say her name before the transmission is cut off, leaving him alone in the TARDIS with tears on his cheeks. After this, whenever he is reminded of Rose he sometimes becomes depressed or pensive. In the audio commentary for "Doomsday" the executive producer [[Julie Gardner]] claimed that she will confirm to the nation the Doctor was going to "say it back". In series three, the Doctor gradually learns that Martha harbours feelings for him before she leaves his company <U+2014> which he inadvertently inspires by kissing her as a distraction<ref name="smithandjones">{{cite episode | title = [[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T. Davies]], Director [[Charles Palmer (director)|Charles Palmer]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2007-03-31}}</ref> <U+2014> and also exchanged kisses with Astrid in honour of "an old tradition" from her home planet. Following the complications with Martha (for which he blames himself), the Doctor seems reluctant to embark on any other potentially romantic companionship, and makes sure that before allowing her to join him, Donna understands that all he wants is a friend. In keeping with this, when he is poisoned in "The Unicorn and the Wasp" and asks Donna to give him a shock of some kind, kissing him proves to be so out of character for her that it is sufficient to trigger the detox process.

The Tenth Doctor sometimes dons a pair of spectacles, like the [[Fifth Doctor]], whose youthful appearance he shares. In the 2007 Children In Need special, "[[Time Crash]]", the Tenth Doctor notes other inherited/inspired tendencies when meeting the Fifth Doctor aside from "the brainy specs" (which he observes were worn by the Fifth simply to look clever rather than out of necessity, therefore implying that his are used for the same reason despite the Fifth Doctor stating twice in series that he was actually near sighted in his left eye "[[Castrovalva]]" and actually needed a corrective lens for that eye) such as wearing plimsolls/trainers and both of their voices becoming high-pitched when shouting. He also exhibits a remarkable sense of taste, again similar to the Fifth Doctor, ("[[Planet of Fire]]"), able to identify the [[blood type]] of a blood sample ("The Christmas Invasion") or the presence of [[mistletoe]] oil ("[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]") just by licking. He also shares the Fifth Doctor's skill with a [[cricket]] ball, as demonstrated in "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]". The Tenth also admitted to the Fifth that he was his favourite past incarnation.

The Tenth Doctor speaks with an [[Estuary English]] accent, rather than the [[English language in England|Salford, Greater Manchester]] (Christopher Eccleston's own accent) that the Ninth Doctor used, the [[Received Pronunciation]] of most earlier Doctors, or Tennant's natural [[Scottish English]]. David Tennant told [[SFX magazine]] in 2006 that Russell T Davies had asked him to drop his natural Scottish accent, because he felt "we'd like to not go for another obvious regional accent, because I suppose they'd done that".<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/I-agreed-to-drop-Scots.2763966.jp I agreed to drop Scots accent for Doctor Who - Tennant], 3 April 2006, [[The Scotsman]]</ref> In a December 23 interview on [[BBC Radio 1]], Tennant explained that a line had been scripted for the Christmas special explaining that the newly regenerated Doctor had imprinted on [[Rose Tyler]]'s accent, "like a chick hatching from an egg", but the line was cut from the final programme. The Tenth Doctor also briefly affected a generic [[Appalachian English|American Appalachian]] accent in "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", and a Scottish accent (David Tennant's own) in "Tooth and Claw".

Like the Ninth Doctor, the Tenth Doctor used his [[Sonic Screwdriver|sonic screwdriver]] quite often. This Doctor relied heavily on the device, and chided his fifth incarnation for going "hands free" in "[[Time Crash]]", a reference to the Fifth Doctor's loss of the device in "[[The Visitation (Doctor Who)|The Visitation]]". This reliance came to a head when the screwdriver was burned out in "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]", having been pushed past its limits in order to boost the radiation output of an X-ray machine. He obtains another screwdriver by the end of the episode.

Much as the Ninth Doctor frequently declared things "Fantastic!", this Doctor has also favoured certain phrases on various occasions such as "What!?" (like the [[Fourth Doctor]], it is used to refer to something unexpected happening, however the Tenth sometimes says it three times in rapid succession), "Brilliant!", "oh yes!" (used in an exuberant fashion, often when he has successfully done something),  "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry", and the French expression "Allons-y" ("Let's go"). The latter was first used in "Army of Ghosts", where the Doctor stated that he should say it more often and that he would love to meet someone named Alonso so he could say "Allons-y, Alonso!", eventually achieving this aim in "Voyage of the Damned" with midshipman Alonso Frame. In addition, he often clarifies his own mistakes by beginning with an elongated "Well..." Like his predecessor, the Tenth Doctor shows a fondness for human popular culture<U+2014>a characteristic not all of his previous incarnations seemed to share<U+2014>but even more so, to the point where he finds himself unknowingly quoting the song "[[Circle of Life]]" from [[Disney]]'s ''[[The Lion King]]'' during a confrontation with the Sycorax leader.

===Appearance===

The Doctor complains that his tenth incarnation is not "[[Red hair|ginger]]". He wears his own dark brown hair in various ways throughout the series: unstyled in "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", a fifties-style quiff in "[[The Idiot's Lantern]]", and flattened forwards in "[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]". He is perceived by most, including companions and other characters as "slim and just a little bit foxy".<ref name="newearth">{{cite episode | title = [[New Earth]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T. Davies]], Director [[James Hawes]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-04-15}}</ref>

He generally wears either a dark brown (with blue pinstripes) or a blue (with rust red pinstripes) four-buttoned suit, a shirt and a tie, a light brown faux-suede overcoat (which he claims was given to him by [[Janis Joplin]]), and different coloured pairs of Converse All Star trainers depending on his suit. According to an interview on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', David Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit [[Jamie Oliver]] had worn on ''Parkinson'' just after Tennant had taken the role.<ref name="parkinson">{{cite episode | title = Episode 26.1 | series = [[Parkinson (TV series)]] | network = [[ITV]] | station = [[ITV1]] | city = London | airdate = 2007-05-05}}</ref> David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes.

Another part of the Doctor's costume is a pair of dark tortoise-shell rectangular frame glasses; since "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" he wears them in numerous episodes. As noted above, the Tenth Doctor credits the [[Fifth Doctor]] with inspiring his footwear and glasses. The Tenth Doctor's costume became so popular that it has spawned numerous recreations (including a BBC-licensed replica of the Tenth Doctor's overcoat by AbbyShot Clothiers<ref>"[http://uberscifigeek.com/?p=8917 Doctor Who Fashion Line from AbbyShot Clothiers]", UberSciFiGeek.com, March 12, 2010</ref>), and has been cited by costume designer Louise Page as the costume she is most proud of from her time on ''Doctor Who''.<ref>Doctor Who Magazine #418, February 2010</ref>

==Appearances==
===Television===
The Ninth Doctor ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]] into the Tenth Doctor ([[David Tennant]]) at the climax of the 2005 series finale, "[[The Parting of the Ways]];" he re-introduces himself to his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in an [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|untitled ''Children in Need'' mini-episode]]. In [[The Christmas Invasion|the Christmas special episode]], he is in a comatose state for most of the episode following his regeneration. After eventually waking up, he defeats the alien [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax]] and saves Earth; in the process, he loses a hand, which regrows owing to his recent regeneration. Amongst other [[Doctor Who (series 2)|2006 series]] adventures, the Doctor and Rose save [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] ([[Pauline Collins]]) from a [[Werewolf (Doctor Who)#Tooth and Claw|werewolf]], resulting in the creation of the anti-alien [[Torchwood Institute]]. The Doctor shares an adventure with two former companions, journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]) and robot dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] ([[John Leeson]]), before taking on Rose's boyfriend [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) as a second assistant. The series finale takes place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war between the evil alien [[Dalek]]s and parallel universe [[cyborg]]s the [[Cybermen]]; saving the Earth costs the Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a parallel universe along with Mickey and her mother, in "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]."

In the closing scene of "Doomsday," a mysterious bride (Catherine Tate), miraculously appears in his TARDIS. The [[The Runaway Bride|2006 Christmas episode]] sees the Doctor and bride-to-be Donna Noble save the Earth; Donna saves the Doctor from going too far in his revenge against the alien [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Racnoss|Racnoss]] and declines his offer of companionship. In the [[Doctor Who (series 3)|2007 series]], the Doctor takes on [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]) as his new companion. Together, they witness the mysterious [[Face of Boe]] ([[Struan Rodger]]) prophesy to the Doctor that "You Are Not Alone." They are rejoined by former companion [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) in a three-episode adventure where thought-deceased archenemy and fellow Time Lord [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]) becomes [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and enslaves the Doctor for one year. Martha's plan sees the Doctor infused with the world's psychic energies, and he easily defeats the Master, who seemingly refuses to regenerate and dies in the Doctor's arms. Following this adventure, in the [[d<U+00E9>nouement]] of series finale "[[Last of the Time Lords]]", Jack and Martha both depart the TARDIS, and the Doctor is shocked to see what appears to be the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] crash into it. Set moments prior, another ''[[Children in Need]]'' mini-episode, "[[Time Crash]]" features a brief encounter between Tennant's Tenth Doctor and the [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]), containing [[meta-joke|meta-humour]] surrounding Davison's Doctor having been a young David Tennant's favourite. In parallel with the third series, Tennant lends his voice to the animated serial ''[[The Infinite Quest]].''

The [[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|2007 Christmas special]] sees the Doctor and a waitress, Astrid ([[Kylie Minogue]]) save the Earth from the impending crash of the starship ''Titanic;'' Astrid dies heroically, and the Doctor encounters [[Wilfred Mott]] ([[Bernard Cribbins]]) for the first time. In the [[Doctor Who (series 4)|2008 series]] [[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|premi<U+00E8>re episode]], the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble, Mott's granddaughter, who becomes his regular companion. In "[[Planet of the Ood]]," the alien [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Ood|Ood]] prophesy the Tenth Doctor's demise. Martha accompanies them for three episodes; in two, the Doctor battles the alien [[Sontarans]], and last of which sees him become a father of sorts to [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] ([[Georgia Moffett]]), in "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]". He meets archaeologist and future companion [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]) for the first time from his perspective in the two-parter "[[Silence in the Library]]"/"[[Forest of the Dead]]"; she dies, but he stores her consciousness to a hard drive to live on forever, after accepting that one day she will come to mean a lot to him. After Donna encounters Rose in an alternate timeline in "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]", the Doctor realises that it must herald the end of the world. In finale episodes "[[The Stolen Earth]]" and "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" (which crossover with spin-offs ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''), the Doctor and Donna reunite with former companions Rose, Sarah Jane, Martha, Jack and Mickey to save the universe from [[Davros]] ([[Julian Bleach]]), the creator of the Daleks. A half-human clone Doctor is created from the Doctor's earlier severed hand, and Donna is given the mind of a Time Lord; the clone Doctor enjoys a happy ending with Rose in the parallel universe, though the Doctor is forced to erase Donna's memories to save her life, leaving him alone. A ''[[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|Doctor Who Prom]]'' mini-episode, "[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]" features a lone Doctor composing his musical ''Ode to the Universe'' before being interrupted by the small alien [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Graske|Graske]] ([[Jimmy Vee]]).

In lieu of a 2009 series, Tennant appears as the Tenth Doctor without a regular companion in several special episodes over the course of 2008 and 2009, the last of which airing on [[New Year's Day]] in 2010.  In Christmas special "[[The Next Doctor]]", the Doctor mistakenly believes he has met a later incarnation of himself in an amnesiac Londoner ([[David Morrissey]]), with whom he saves [[Victorian era]] London. "[[Planet of the Dead]]" (Easter 2009) features jewel thief [[Lady Christina de Souza]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) as the Doctor's one-off companion, and the Doctor is presented with a prophecy of his imminent death. Tennant makes a crossover appearance in a "The Sarah Jane Adventures" two-parter, "[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]", in which a powerful being known as [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures creatures and aliens#The Trickster|the Trickster]] ([[Paul Marc Davis]]) also alludes to the Tenth Doctor's impending demise. In "[[The Waters of Mars]]", the Doctor tries to alter history and avert the death of one-off companion Adelaide Brooke ([[Lindsay Duncan]]);  when she commits [[suicide]], he begins to feel his mortality weigh down upon him. In the animated serial ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'', the Doctor is joined by two one-off companions in [[1950s]] [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. In the two-part send-off ''[[The End of Time]]'', the Doctor confronts the Ood about their original prophecy and is led to contemporary Earth where the again-resurrected Master (Simm), in the second part restores Gallifrey and the Time Lords to existence, although redeems himself in assisting the Doctor defeat Time Lord President [[Rassilon]] ([[Timothy Dalton]]) and disappearing alongside the other Time Lords. The Doctor sacrifices his life to save Wilfred Mott, exposing himself to 500,000 [[rad (unit)|rads]] of deadly radiation in the process, and triggering his [[regeneration]]. He holds it back and visits each of his companions, though of these the audience only sees his most recent ones.{{ref label|A|a|none}} He gives Donna a winning lottery ticket on her wedding day, saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran sniper, saves Sarah Jane's son [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]] ([[Tommy Knight]]) from a car, introduces Jack to a romantic interest Alonso Frame ([[Russell Tovey]]), and before regenerating into the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]), informs Rose circa 2005 that she is about to have a "great year." At the absolute end of his endurance and aided by the song of the Ood, the Doctor barely staggers back to the TARDIS and sets a new course. Fighting the inevitable with his final breath, the Tenth Doctor says his last words; "I don't want to go" before regenerating in a violent and explosive manner.

====Spoofs====
David Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as the Doctor outside of "Doctor Who," frequently in [[Doctor Who spoofs|spoof appearances]]. Singer and actress [[Charlotte Church]] spoofs "Doctor Who" alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own "[[The Charlotte Church Show]]" (2006). In an appearance on "[[The Friday Night Project]]" in 2007, Tennant plays female companion to the Tenth Doctor ([[Justin Lee Collins]]) on the Pink Planet where they are confronted by the alien Gay Lord ([[Alan Carr]]). When the show became "The Sunday Night Project," Catherine Tate appeared in a skit playing the Tenth Doctor. Tennant starred opposite Catherine Tate in her own "[[The Catherine Tate Show]]" special (2007) as [[Lauren Cooper]]'s (Tate) teacher Mr. Logan, who Cooper teases for his resemblance to the Doctor; eventually, he reveals himself to be the Tenth Doctor and shrinks Cooper into a 5" Rose Tyler [[action figure]]. In the final episode of "[[Extras]]" (December 2007), a brief scene shows the Doctor and an unidentified [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wren]] companion attacked by Schlong, a slug-like alien played by [[Andy Millman]] ([[Ricky Gervais]]). The Tenth Doctor is also featured in political satire; in a 2007 episode of "[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]," when faced by the question of [[Gordon Brown]]'s succession, [[Tony Blair]] (impressionist [[Jon Culshaw]]) regenerates into David Tennant after promising "[[New Labour]] is all about renewal," later vowing 100 more years of power. Tennant modifies his first line in "The Parting of the Ways" ("New teeth, that's weird"), to "New Labour, that's weird" and proceeds to address the public in a Tony Blair impression resembling Culshaw's.

===Literature===
<!--If you're looking for an extensive list, go here: http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor_-_List_of_Appearances; it doesn't go on Wikipedia.-->As the face of the ''Doctor Who'' franchise for 2005-10, the Tenth Doctor appears extensively in ''Doctor Who'' spin-off media; in the majority of these series, the character simply takes after the place of the Ninth Doctor, and in turn is replaced by the Eleventh following the debut of [[Doctor Who (series 5)|the 2010 series]].
