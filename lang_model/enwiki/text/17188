'''Cho Chang''' (born [[Dates in Harry Potter#Births|1979]]) is a [[fictional character]] in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series. She is a [[Hogwarts Houses#Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw]] student and a year older than [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]]. She is described as being a short, very pretty girl with long, black hair. She appears to be very popular as she always seems to be followed by a large group of friends. Cho plays Seeker for the Ravenclaw [[Quidditch]] team, and her favourite professional Quidditch team is the Tutshill Tornadoes. Her name seems to imply [[East Asia]]n descent, very likely [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] or [[Korean people|Korean]].

Cho was played by [[Katie Leung]] in the fourth [[Harry Potter]] movie, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.  Leung will reprise the role in the fifth movie, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''.

__TOC__
==Biography==
{{spoiler}}
Cho is Harry's first [[Limerence|crush]], romantic interest, and girlfriend, although things do not work out between them.

Harry first meets Cho in his third year{{HP3}} during a [[Hogwarts Houses#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]]-Ravenclaw Quidditch match, in which they play Seeker against each other. He notices she is a "very pretty girl," which makes his stomach "feel funny." The only other notable interaction is when Cho wishes Harry good luck before the Quidditch Match against Slytherin and Harry goes bright red (although Harry is unaware that Hermione saw this).

[[Image:Cho Chang ball.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cho in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], during the Yule Ball.]]During Harry's fourth year,{{HP4}} his crush on Cho develops further. They exchange greetings at the Quidditch World Cup, and he later works up his courage and asks her to be his date to the [[Yule Ball]]. However, [[Cedric Diggory]], one of the other champions of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], has already asked Cho out, and the two of them end up [[Courtship|dating]] until Cedric is murdered by [[Peter Pettigrew]]/Wormtail on [[Lord Voldemort]]'s orders at the end of the book. Also, Cho meets Harry on the owl tower, unexpected, which is where Harry asks her to go to the Ball (in the movie only). Nonetheless, Cho is still kind to Harry: for example, she refuses to wear one of [[Draco Malfoy]]'s "Support Cedric Diggory/Potter Stinks" badges, a fact for which Harry is grateful.

At the beginning of Harry's fifth year,{{HP5}} Cho surprises him by seeking him out several times and attempting to have a conversation. Unfortunately, for Harry, these encounters do not go well. The first time, she finds him covered with Stinksap that was accidentally let off by [[Neville Longbottom]]'s ''[[Wizarding world#Mimbulus mimbletonia|mimbulus mimbletonia]]'', and the second time she tries to talk with Harry, she ends up arguing with [[Ron Weasley]] about Quidditch teams; through this we learn Cho is at least a half-blood. On the third try, when she happens to enter the Owlery while Harry is there, she defends Harry from a suspicious [[Argus Filch]], which pleases Harry.  When she and Harry are at Madam Puddifoot's teashop, she becomes jealous and storms out crying when Harry says that he is meeting Hermione later.

When invited by Harry to join [[Dumbledore's Army]], Cho (who brings along her fellow [[Ravenclaw]] friend, [[Marietta Edgecombe]]) goes against the advice of her parents who wish her to remain on [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s good side. Cho joins because she is determined to fight against Voldemort after what happened to Cedric in the previous year. As a DA student, however, she has her ups and downs. At first she gets nervous and messes up her spells when Harry is nearby; later though, she is able to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the shape of a [[swan]]. Cho also had sworn to avenge Cedric's death. It was one of the main reasons why Cho joined Dumbledore's Army.

Cho initiates a [[kiss]] with Harry under some [[mistletoe]] shortly before [[Christmas]] after a DA session, and on [[St. Valentine's Day]] they go on a date in the all-wizard village of [[Hogsmeade]], but Cho's increasing emotional instability over the death of Cedric, her unfounded [[jealousy]] over Harry's friendship with [[Hermione Granger]] (who, ironically, tried to advise Harry on how to handle other girls), and Harry's overall inexperience with girls sours the experience.

When Marietta betrays the DA, she is afflicted by the [[Curse|hex]] performed by Hermione on the piece of parchment, signed earlier by all members of the DA. The hex makes purple pimples spell "SNEAK" across her forehead and they prove very difficult to remove, perhaps impossible. When Harry scorns Marietta for the betrayal and Cho defends her, irate at what she considers Hermione's "dirty trick", Harry and Cho's relationship cools considerably.

After the death of [[Sirius Black]], Harry realizes that his feelings for Cho have ended. At the end of Harry's fifth year, [[Ginny Weasley]] reveals that Cho is dating her ex-boyfriend, [[Minor Ravenclaws#Michael Corner|Michael Corner]]. Harry's only reaction is to note that finding out she was now seeing someone else "did not hurt at all." 

Cho makes only one very brief appearance in [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]].{{HP6}} Harry catches a glimpse of her during the ride on the [[Hogwarts Express]] but she hides back in her compartment with Marietta. Harry later mentions in a conversation with Ron that the two of them just "fell apart." This was also Cho's last year of Hogwarts, which means she may or may not be back for book seven.

== Possible Etymology of the Name ==
[[Image:chochang.jpg|thumb|left|Cho exchanges a look with Harry on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.]]

Though some have criticised that "Cho Chang" is a nonsensical [[stereotype]] of an East Asian name, it is worth noting that the vast majority of J.K. Rowling's character names have stereotypical ethnic connotations, employ hidden jokes, or use [[alliteration]]. For example, "[[Igor Karkaroff]]" is a stereotypical [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name, [[Parvati Patil]] is a stereotypical [[India]]n name, "[[Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year#Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]]" is a stereotypical [[Ireland|Irish]] name, and even "Harry Potter" is a stereotypical English name. The difficulty in the case of Cho is that it is impossible to precisely pinpoint her ethnic origin from her name: even though the surname [[Zhang (surname)|Chang]] (<U+5F35>/<U+5F20>/<U+C7A5>) is most commonly found in [[China]] or [[Korea]], there are no common given names that sound like "cho" in either of these countries. In fact, "Cho" is also a common [[Korean name|Korean surname]] (<U+C870>) and it is possible that, not being very familiar with East Asian languages or traditions, Ms. Rowling simply created a character using two surnames, not realising that she was committing this mistake. 

In Chinese translations of the Harry Potter novels, Cho's given name is <U+79CB>, "Autumn", pronounced "qi<U+016B>" ("chiou") in [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] and "ch<U+0101>u" ("chow") in [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]]. Since the action takes place in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Hong Kong]] was under [[History of Hong Kong|British control]] for most of the 20th century, it would make 'historical' sense for Cho to be of Cantonese ancestry. Incidentally, the actress who portrays Cho in the movies, [[Katie Leung]], is also of Cantonese ancestry.

There is also an interesting discrepancy between the [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional Chinese]] translations of the books. In the Traditional Chinese versions, used in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]], Cho's name is written as "<U+5F35><U+79CB>" ("Chang" first), since historically Chinese names are written with the family name first, followed by given names. However, in the [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] version the name is written as "<U+79CB><U+00B7><U+5F20>" ("Chang" last), which is a peculiar translation, since the [[Interpunct|middle dot]] is normally applied to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] non-Chinese names, where it is used to separate the given names, coming first, from the surname, coming last. It is possible that the Mainland translator's goal was to emphasise the fact that Cho Chang, while [[Han Chinese|ethnically Chinese]], is nonetheless British by birth or citizenship.

The Mainland Chinese version, when read in Cantonese, sounds close to the Cantonese word for "frustrating", which somehow fits Cho Chang's character in the books. In addition, when pronounced with a different [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in Mandarin, Cho ("qi<U+016B>") sounds close to "qi<U+00FA>", which means ball (<U+7403>). This is a clever pun on Cho's role as the Ravenclaw [[Quidditch|seeker]], though it is unclear whether these puns are intentionally placed there by translators, or are just mere coincidences.


When pronounced "Chou Chang" (<U+60C6><U+6005>), it means "melancholy" in Chinese, which seems to fit her sadness of teenage love.

"Cho" also means "butterfly" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (<U+8776>), but since the surname "Chang" is not found among ethnic [[Japan|Japanese]], it is probably just a coincidence. In the translations, her name is given as "Ch<U+014D> Chan" (<U+30C1><U+30E7><U+30A6><U+30FB><U+30C1><U+30E3><U+30F3>), and the fact that her last name is not spelled as "Changu" (<U+30C1><U+30E3><U+30F3><U+30B0>), which would be more common for Western names ending in -ng (e.g. "Rowling" becomes <U+30ED><U+30FC><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30B0>, "R<U+014D>ringu"), suggests that the translator considered the name to be of Chinese or Korean origin.

"Cho Chang" is also the name of a consonant (<U+0E0A>) in the [[Thai alphabet]] (<U+0E0A><U+0E2D> <U+0E0A><U+0E49><U+0E32><U+0E07>), though the way it is pronounced is rather different from the way it is written in Latin characters, plus it is not considered a meaningful name in Thai. The meaning of the letter &ndash; "elephant" &ndash; is also doubtfully well-suited for a young girl.
