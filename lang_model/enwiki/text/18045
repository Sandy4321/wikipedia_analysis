'''Chadderton''' (pop. 33,000) is a town within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England,<ref name="Visit">{{citation |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080123075034/http://www.visitoldham.co.uk/heritage/chadderton.htm|title=Chadderton|publisher=visitoldham.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2009-09-11|work=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2008-06-17|date= 2003-07-31}}</ref> [[Historic counties of England|historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], Chadderton was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families who occupied them.<ref name="Top of England">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1848|pp=538-542.}}</ref> Its early history is marked by its status as a [[manorialism|manorial]] [[Township (England)|township]], with its own line of [[lord]]s and overlords, who included the [[Assheton Baronets|Asshetons]], Chethams, Radclyffes, and [[De Trafford Baronets|Traffords]]. Farming was the main industry of the area, with locals supplementing their incomes by [[hand-loom]] [[woollen]] weaving in the [[domestic system]].

Chadderton's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Victorian era]]. A late 19th-century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural township into a major [[mill town]]<U+2014>one of several in its region<U+2014>and the second most populous [[urban district]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Chadderton8">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1997|p=8}}.</ref><ref name="ChadRoy1932">{{citation |title=North Chadderton & SW Royton|edition=1932|publisher=Alan Godfrey Maps|cartography=[[Ordnance Survey]]|isbn=978-1-84784-157-5|section=Lancashire Sheet 97.01|year=2008}}</ref><ref name="Chad1907">{{citation |title=Chadderton|edition=1907|publisher=Alan Godfrey Maps|cartography=[[Ordnance Survey]]|isbn=978-1-84151-159-7|section=Lancashire Sheet 97.05|year=2008}}</ref> More than 50&nbsp;[[cotton mill]]s had been built in Chadderton by 1914.<ref name="Chadderton8"/>

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Chadderton derives from ''Caderton'', which is believed to be a combination of the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] word ''Cader'' or ''Cater'' (modern {{lang-cy|[[Caer]]}}), indicating a fortified place amongst the hills, and the [[Old English]] suffix ''[[List of generic forms in British place names|-ton]]'' meaning a settlement.<ref name="Chadderton7">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1997|p=7}}.</ref><ref name="Looking3">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=3}}.</ref><ref name="Plan"/> The [[University of Nottingham]]'s Institute for Name-Studies has offered a similar suggestion, that the name Chadderton means "farm or settlement at the hill called Cadeir".<ref>{{citation | author = University of Nottingham's Institute for Name-Studies| authorlink = University of Nottingham| title = Chadderton| publisher =  nottingham.ac.uk| date = | url = http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=12887 | accessdate = 2008-06-17}}</ref> This name is believed to date from the 7th century, when [[Angles]] colonised the region following the [[Battle of Chester]].<ref name="Ballard11-12">{{Harvnb|Ballard|1986|p=11-12}}.</ref> It has been suggested that the Anglian settlers found a few Brythonic Celts already inhabiting what is now called Chadderton, and borrowed their name for the hill, "Chadder", adding their own word for a settlement to the end.<ref name="Bateson3">{{Harvnb|Bateson|1949|p=3}}</ref> Archaic spellings include Chaderthon, Chaderton, Chaterton, and Chatherton.<ref name="County of Lancs">{{Harvnb|Brownbill|Farrer|1911|pp=115-121}}.</ref> The first known written record of the name Chadderton is in a legal document relating to land tenure, in about 1220.<ref name="Looking3"/>

===Early history===
[[Image:River Irk, Chadderton.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View down a small river, bending to the left, crossed by a wooden footbridge in the middle distance.|Chadderton Fold by the [[River Irk]], the ancient centre of the township of Chadderton, where [[Dark Ages|Dark Age]] and medieval relics have been discovered.]]
The [[Toponymy in Great Britain|study of place names]] in Chadderton suggests that the ancient [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] once inhabited the area.<ref name="Bateson3"/> Remains of [[Roman road]]s have been discovered running through the town,<ref name="Chadderton7"/><ref name="County of Lancs"/> and the local road name ''Streetbridge'' suggests that the Romans once marched along it on a path which may have led to [[Blackstone Edge]].<ref name="Looking3"/><ref name="Plan"/> Relics found at a [[tumulus]] in Chadderton Fold date from the Early Middle Ages, probably from the early period of [[history of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]],<ref name="Looking3"/><ref name="County of Lancs"/> when [[Angles]] settled in the area and Chadderton emerged as a [[manorialism|manor]] of the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]].

Chadderton is not recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of&nbsp;1086. Its first appearance in a written record is in a legal document from around&nbsp;1220, which states that Robert, Rector of Prestwich, gave land to Richard, son of Gilbert, in exchange for an annual fee of one silver penny.<ref name="Looking3"/> Following the [[Norman conquest of England]], Chadderton was made a constituent manor of the wider Royal Estate of [[Tottington, Greater Manchester|Tottington]], an extensive [[Fee simple|fee]] held by the [[Normans|Norman]] overlord, [[Roger de Montbegon]].<ref name="Chadderton7"/><ref name="Looking4">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=4}}.</ref> Taxation and governance continued on this basis throughout the Middle Ages, with the Barons Montbegon of [[Hornby Castle, Lancashire|Hornby Castle]] holding the estate, until it passed to the [[de Lacy|Barons Lacy]] of [[Clitheroe Castle]], and then onto local families.<ref name="Chadderton7"/> In about&nbsp;1235, the sub-manor of Chadderton and Foxdenton passed from Richard de Trafford of Trafford Park to Geoffrey de Trafford, who adopted the surname of Chadderton, thus founding the Chadderton family.<ref name="Plan"/> During the High Middle Ages, pieces of land in Chadderton were granted to religious orders and institutions, including [[Cockersand Abbey]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]].<ref name="Looking3"/> 

The [[manorialism|manorial]] system was strong in Chadderton, and this lent distinction to the township,<ref name="Chadderton7"/> in a region which otherwise had weak local lordship.<ref name="McNev2">{{Harvnb|McNeil|Nevell|2000|p=2}}.</ref> Throughout the Middle Ages, the manor of Chadderton constituted a [[Township (England)|township]], centred on the hill by the banks of the [[River Irk]], known as Chadderton Fold.<ref name="Chadderton7"/> The fold consisted of a cluster of cottages centred around Chadderton Hall [[manor house]], and a water-powered [[Gristmill|corn mill]].<ref name="Chadderton7"/> Chadderton Hall was owned and occupied by the de Chaddertons. Geoffrey de Chadderton became the [[Lord of the Manor]] of Tottington in the 13th century.<ref name="Chad1907"/><ref name="Looking5">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=5}}.</ref> The de Chaddertons' involvement in regional and national affairs gave prestige to what was otherwise an obscure and rural township. [[William Chaderton]] was [[Bishop of Chester]] from 1579 to 1595 and held distinguished academic posts such as [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]].<ref name="Looking5"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Horn|Smith|Mussett|2004|pp=37-42}}.</ref> [[Laurence Chaderton]] was the first Master of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and among the first translators of the [[King James Version of the Bible]].<ref name="Looking5"/>  Tottington was dissolved in the mid-15th century and there came a succession of distinguished families, each headed by an [[esquire]] with links to the [[monarchs of England]]. The Radclyffe, Assheton, and Horton families provided six [[High Sheriff of Lancashire|High Sheriffs of Lancashire]] and a [[Governor of the Isle of Man]].<ref name="Looking5"/> 

Apart from the dignitaries who lived in Chadderton's [[manor house]]s, Chadderton's population during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of [[Retinue|retainer]]s, most of whom were occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs, and domestic fowl.<ref name="Plan"/> Workers supplemented their incomes by [[loom|hand-loom]] spinning and weaving of wool [[Putting-out system|at home]].<ref name="Chadderton7"/><ref name="Plan"/> The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in 1646.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bateson|1949|p=41}}.</ref>

===Textiles and the Industrial Revolution===

It closed in 1998 and was demolished in 1999.]]
Until the mid-18th century, the region in and around Chadderton was dominated by dispersed agricultural settlements.<ref name="McNeil"/> During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with [[pasture]], but who supplemented their incomes by working in [[Cottage industry|cottage industries]], particularly [[fustian]] and silk weaving.<ref name="Plan"/><ref name="Looking6">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=6}}.</ref> A [[fulling mill]] at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the [[Elizabethan era]],<ref name="Looking6"/> and during the [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern period]] the weavers of Chadderton had been using [[spinning wheel]]s in makeshift [[weavers' cottage]]s to produce [[woollen]]s. Primitive early 18th-century [[industrialisation]] developed slowly in Chadderton.<ref name="Plan"/> However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of [[cotton-spinning machinery]] improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A [[Hydropower|water-powered]] cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776.<ref name="Chadderton8"/><ref name="Chad1907"/><ref name="Chadderton63"/">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1997|p=63}}.</ref> The damp climate below the [[South Pennines]] provided ideal conditions for textile production to be carried out without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of [[yarn]] and fabric for the global market. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] advanced, [[socioeconomic]] conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] in the [[factory system]], which became the dominant source of employment in the locality.<ref name="Looking6"/> The construction of multi-storey [[steam power]]ed mills followed, which initiated a process of [[urbanisation]] and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.<ref name="McNev2"/>

During this early period of change, Chadderton's parliamentary representation was limited to two [[Members of Parliament]] for [[Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancashire]]. Nationally, the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and [[unemployment]] for textile workers, and by the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the lack of [[suffrage]] in [[northern England]], had enhanced the appeal of [[Radicalism (historical)|political Radicalism]] in the region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frangopulo|1977|p=30}}.</ref> The Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, began to organise a mass public demonstration in [[Manchester]] to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. Organised preparations took place, and a spy reported that in neighbouring [[Thornham, Greater Manchester|Thornham]], "seven hundred men drilled [...] as well as any army regiment would".<ref>{{Harvnb|McPhillips|1997|p=22-23}}.</ref> A few days later, on 3&nbsp;August, a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in Manchester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|1989|p=125}}.</ref> On 16&nbsp;August 1819, Chadderton (like its neighbours) sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration now known as the [[Peterloo Massacre]] (owing to the 15 deaths and 400<U+2013>700 injuries which followed).<ref name="ChadRoy1932"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Marlow|1969|p=95}}.</ref> Two of the 15&nbsp;deceased were from the area: John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marlow|1969|pp=150<U+2013>151}}.</ref>

New markets in Europe and South America increased the demand for Britain's cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from [[plantation]]s in the United States to Manchester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aspin|1981|p=4}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1998|p=5}}.</ref> From the markets in Manchester, mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into yarn and cloth. Supplies were cut during the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine]] of 1861<U+2013>65 as a result of the [[American Civil War]], leading to the formation of the Chadderton [[Local Board of Health]] in 1873, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis.<ref name="Looking7">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=7}}.</ref> Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that the last remnants of Chadderton's plentiful cheap open land, used for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular multi-storey brick-built factories<U+2014>35 by 1891.<ref name="Looking6"/> Chadderton's former villages and hamlets [[Agglomeration|agglomerated]] as a [[mill town]] around these factories and a network of newly created roads, canals and railways.<ref name="Chadderton8"/><ref name="Chadderton27"/><ref name="McPhillips">{{Harvnb|McPhillips|1977|p=13}}</ref> The Chadderton landscape was "dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white brick".<ref>{{Harvnb|Norwich|2004|p=497}}.</ref> Neighbouring [[Oldham]] (which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world)<ref name="McNeil">{{Harvnb|McNeil|Nevell|2000|p=29}}.</ref><ref name="Cotton of Oldham">{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1998|pp=4-5.}}</ref> encroached upon Chadderton's eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds,<ref name="Top of England"/> and forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with [[Royton]], [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]] and [[Shaw and Crompton]]<U+2014>the [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]] parliamentary constituency<U+2014>which at its peak was responsible for 13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the world's cotton production.<ref>{{citation |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080203143304/http://www.visitoldham.co.uk/heritage/history.htm|title=Heritage; The History of Oldham; Oldham History |publisher=visitoldham.co.uk |work=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> These [[Victorian era]] developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road, by Chadderton's eastern boundary with Oldham.<ref name="Chad1907"/><ref name="Chadderton27">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1997|p=27}}.</ref> Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926,<ref name="Looking6"/> and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton's population, worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name="Looking44">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=44}}.</ref> Industries ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, [[coal mining]], bleaching and dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton's population were otherwise involved in the sector. [[Philip Sydney Stott, 1st Baronet|Philip Stott]] was a Chadderton-born architect, [[civil engineer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] of cotton mills. Stott's mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, multiplying the town's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity.<ref name="Cotton of Oldham">{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1998|p=17.}}</ref> 
[[Image:Colshaw Green Road, Chadderton.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View down a street of two-storey brick-built terraced houses.|A consequence of Chadderton's industrial development was its transformation from a rural manor to a densely populated [[working class]] town, with extensive areas of [[terraced house|terraced housing]].]]
The [[boomtown]] of Chadderton reached its industrial zenith in the 1910s, with over 50&nbsp;cotton mills within the town limits.<ref name="Chadderton8"/> A social consequence of this industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged [[working class]] community living in an [[urban sprawl]] of low quality [[terraced house]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aspin|1981|pp=29-31}}.</ref> However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, [[Carnegie library]], public swimming baths, and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition [[the Crown]] for honorific [[History of borough status in England and Wales|borough status]] for Chadderton in the 1930s.<ref name="Chad1907"/><ref name="Looking7"/> However, the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, and by 1997 only two mills were operational.<ref name="Chadderton8"/> In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998.<ref name="Visit"/><ref name="ChadRoy1932"/> Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.<ref name="Plan"/>

===Post-industrial history===
During the second half of the 20th&nbsp;century, Chadderton experienced accelerated [[deindustrialisation]] along with economic decline.<ref name="Chadderton8"/> Large areas of Victorian and Edwardian era [[terraced house|terraced housing]] were identified as unsuited for modern needs, and were subsequently demolished.<ref name="Chadderton33">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1997|p=3}}.</ref> However, the town's population continued to grow as a result of [[urban renewal]] and modern suburban housing developments.<ref name="Plan"/><ref name="Oldham Beyond"/> During the 1970s and 1980s, redevelopment in the form of new shopping, health and leisure facilities contributed to the growth and renewal of Chadderton.<ref name="Plan"/><ref name="Looking8">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1990|p=8}}.</ref> In&nbsp;1990, the new Firwood Park, on the west side of Chadderton, was said to be the largest private housing estate in Europe.<ref name="Looking8"/><ref name="Chadderton10">{{Harvnb|Lawson|Johnson|1997|p=10}}.</ref> Chadderton in the 21st&nbsp;century has continued to be a regional hub for the [[secondary sector of the economy]] through [[BAE Systems]] and [[Zetex Semiconductors]], all based within the town limits.<ref name="Visit"/> Other major employers include [[The Stationery Office]] and [[Trinity Mirror]].<ref name="Visit"/><ref name="Plan">{{citation |url=http://www.oldham.gov.uk/chadderton_area_plan_-_april_04b.pdf|publisher=oldham.gov.uk|title=Chadderton Area Plan|format=PDF|date=January 2004|accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref>
