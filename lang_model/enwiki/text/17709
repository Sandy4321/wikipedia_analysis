"'''Lisa the Iconoclast'''" is the sixteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February 18, 1996. In the episode, [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s bicentennial approaches, and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] writes an essay on town founder Jebediah Springfield. While doing research, she finds a confession revealing that Springfield was a murderous pirate named Hans Sprungfeld who never cared about the people of Springfield. Lisa and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] decide to get the message out, but instead anger the town council.

The episode was written by [[Jonathan Collier]] and directed by [[Mike B. Anderson]].  It was Anderson's first directing role.  The story was inspired by the real events of when President [[Zachary Taylor]] was exhumed. [[Donald Sutherland]] guest starred as the voice of Hollis Hurlbut, a part that was written specifically for him. The episode includes several references to Colonial America, including [[Gilbert Stuart]]'s unfinished 1796 painting of [[George Washington]]. The episode features two [[neologisms]]: ''[[wikt:embiggen|embiggen]]'' and ''[[wikt:cromulent|cromulent]]'' which were intended to sound like real words but play on the fact that they are completely fabricated. ''Embiggen'', coined by [[Dan Greaney]], has seen use in several scientific publications, while ''cromulent'', coined by [[David X. Cohen]], appeared in the [[Dictionary.com]]'s 21st Century Lexicon.

==Plot==
As [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] celebrates its bicentennial, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s class at [[Springfield Elementary School]] are assigned essays. Lisa goes to the [[historical society]] to research about [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Jebediah Springfield|Jebediah Springfield]], the founder of Springfield. While trying to play Jebediah Springfield's [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]], she makes the shocking discovery that the town's founder was actually a villainous [[Piracy|pirate]] and enemy of [[George Washington]] who kept his dark past hidden. He had written his confession on the back side of a portrait of Washington and hidden it in his fife. Meanwhile, upon Lisa's suggestion, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is elected the [[town crier]] after he demonstrated that he was a better town crier than [[Ned Flanders]].

Lisa conducts further research about Jebediah Springfield, and finds out that he was actually a pirate named Hans Sprungfeld who, having lost his tongue, had replaced it with a prosthetic [[silver]] tongue. The town, including Marge, does not agree with Lisa's revelations, resulting in an "F" on a report about Springfield while [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Elizabeth Hoover|Ms. Hoover]] deems her to be a "[[Political correctness|PC]] Thug." She also receives a ban from the Historical Society for three months. Lisa tries to convince the town her claims are true, but the only person who believes her is Homer. However, she convinces the municipal government to disinter Mr. Springfield's body to search for evidence of a legendary silver tongue. Despite Lisa's suspicions, when they open the coffin, the skeleton possesses no silver tongue. Lisa is forced into admitting she was wrong and [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]] strips Homer of the role of town crier and reassigns it to Flanders.

That night, Lisa has a dream wherein the ghosts of Jebediah Springfield and George Washington appear. After seeing the incomplete portrait of George Washington in her classroom, Lisa soon figures out that the piece of paper upon which the confession is written is the bottom half of the portrait. She confronts town historian, Hollis Hurlbut, with this piece of evidence. Hurlbut confesses that he stole the tongue while the dust cleared seconds after the coffin was opened and hid it in a cowboy maquette in the museum. He explained that he had done so to protect his career and the myth of Jebediah Springfield. After realizing the mistake of celebrating a pirate, the two decide to go public with their discovery. Just as Lisa is about to expose the "real Jebediah" to the parading townspeople, she realizes that Jebediah Springfield's good image means too much to the town, and decides to keep the truth a secret, knowing that town will lose hope and morale if the truth is revealed to the public. She says she was mistaken in her research of Jebediah Springfield and that he was actually a great man. At the parade Homer takes the tri-cornered hat and bell from Flanders and replaces him, marching through the parade with Lisa on his shoulder.

The episode was written by [[Jonathan Collier]] and directed by [[Mike B. Anderson]].<ref name="BBC"/> The story was inspired by the real events of when President [[Zachary Taylor]] was exhumed.<ref name="Oakley"/> In the late 1980s, college professor and author Clara Rising theorized that Taylor was murdered by poison and was able to convince Taylor's closest living relative and the [[Coroner]] of Jefferson County, Kentucky, to order an exhumation. On June 17, 1991, Taylor's remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the [[Kentucky]] Chief Medical Examiner. The remains were then returned to the cemetery and received appropriate honors at reinterment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev27-12/text/ansside6.html |title=President Zachary Taylor and the Laboratory: Presidential Visit from the Grave |accessdate=2009-03-04 |work=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]}}</ref> Then-[[show runner]] [[Bill Oakley]] said "Lisa the Iconoclast" is "essentially the same" story but with Lisa in the role as Rising.<ref name="Oakley"/> At the end of the episode there is an ode to Jebediah Springfield playing over the credits. The music and lyrics for this piece of music were all written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]].<ref name="Oakley"/>

Donald Sutherland voiced Hollis Hurlbut in this episode.<ref name="BBC"/> The script was specifically written with him in mind playing that part.<ref name="Collier"/> Sutherland wanted to do the voice recordings as one would do a film and start in the middle of the script, so that he could get to know the character, but that idea was abandoned.<ref name="Oakley"/> In the episode, Lisa joked she was getting over her "Chester A. Arthuritis", a play on the word "[[arthritis]]" and the name of [[Chester A. Arthur]]. Sutherland ad-libbed the line "you had arthritis?", and the producers liked it so much that they kept it.<ref name="Oakley"/>

The episode opens with an old documentary on Jebediah Springfield, starring [[Troy McClure]] as Springfield. The writers tried to make this documentary seem as lousy and low-budget as possible. One of these tricks was to have post-production add scratches to the animation.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Iconoclast"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The animaters added production errors that would come in a low-budget film. For example, a man in the crowd looks at the camera, some of the people have watches on,<ref name="Anderson">{{cite video | people=Anderson, Mike B.|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Iconoclast"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> McClure's stuntman does not have the same sideburns as he does, and a [[Boom operator (media)|boom microphone]] can be seen entering the frame.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Iconoclast"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In the Historical Society, the animators spent a lot of time decorating the walls. Besides numerous [[#Cultural references|historical references]], they also decorated the walls with ''The Simpsons'' characters set in the 19th century. The first painting shows [[Otto Mann]] (Springfield's schoolbus driver) driving children in a horse-drawn [[carriage]].  Another painting shows [[Marge Simpson]] in [[silhouette]]. The last one shows [[Professor Frink]] holding a kite in the manner of [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref name="Oakley"/>

==Cultural references==

The Historical Society of Springfield contains references to historical figures and facts. The episode features [[Gilbert Stuart]]'s unfinished 1796 painting of George Washington and tells a fictional backstory of how it came to be. In reality, the painting was unfinished and it did not have a part torn off.<ref name="Oakley"/> Hurlbut mentions the American revolutionaries [[William Dawes]] and [[Samuel Allyne Otis]] as equals to Jebediah Springfield.<ref name="BBC"/> When Lisa passes out the "Wanted for treason" posters, it is a reference to the ones [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] passed around, which were about [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Iconoclast"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Hurlbut claims Springfield's confessions are "just as fake" as the [[Melvin Dummar|will of Howard Hughes]] and the [[Hitler Diaries|diaries of Adolf Hitler]], both of which are genuine forgeries.<ref name="BBC"/>

The episode also contains references to popular culture. The opening couch gag shows the [[Simpson family]] in blue boxes similar to the style of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> [[Chief Wiggum]] is singing "[[Camptown Races]]" from 1850 by [[Stephen Foster]] ventriloquised with the skull of Jebediah Springfield.<ref name="BBC"/> Lisa's dream in which Washington and Springfield are fighting is a reference to ''[[Lethal Weapon]]''.<ref name="Anderson"/> When Lisa is telling the people at [[List of fictional locations in The Simpsons#Moe's Tavern|Moe's Tavern]] about the real history of Jebediah Springfield, they all sit with their mouths open. This is a reference to a scene in the film ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' from 1968.<ref name="Anderson"/> When Homer knocks over Ned Flanders in order to take over his job as town crier, it is a reference to the film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' from 1978.<ref name="Weinstein"/> In addition to these cultural references, at least one author has compared this episode to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s short work ''On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life''.<ref name='SNUH'>Boven, David (November 2003), [http://www.bovenet.com/app/download/2936929013/Nietzsche%2C+The+Simpsons%2C+and+History.pdf "Nietzsche, ''The Simpsons'', and History"], ''The SNUH Journal'' '''1''' (1).</ref>

==''Embiggen'' and ''cromulent'' {{anchor|Embiggen|Cromulent|Cromulent and embiggens}} ==
The episode features two [[neologism]]s: ''embiggen'' and ''cromulent''.<ref name="Oakley"/> The show runners asked the writers if they could come up with two words which sounded like real words, and these were what they came up with.<ref name="Collier">{{cite video | people=Collier, Jonathan |date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Iconoclast"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] town [[motto]] is "A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man." Schoolteacher [[Edna Krabappel]] comments that she never heard the word ''embiggens'' until she moved to Springfield. Miss Hoover, another teacher, replies, "I don't know why; it<U+2019>s a perfectly cromulent word." Later in the episode, while talking about Homer's audition for the role of town crier, [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] states, "He's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance."

''Embiggen''<U+2014>in the context it is used in the episode<U+2014>is a verb that was coined by [[Dan Greaney]] in 1996.<ref name="Oakley"/> The verb previously occurred in an 1884 edition of the British journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]: A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men, General Readers, Etc.'' by C. A. Ward, in the sentence "but the people magnified them, to make great or ''embiggen'', if we may invent an English parallel as ugly. After all, use is nearly everything."<ref>{{cite book |title=Notes and Queries: A Medium of Intercommunication for Literary Men, General Readers, Etc |last=Ward |first=C.

The first occurrence of the word was in the journal ''High Energy Physics'' in the article "Gauge/gravity duality and meta-stable dynamical supersymmetry breaking", which was published on January 23, 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Argurio |first=Riccardo |authorlink= |coauthors=Matteo Bertolini, Sebasti<U+00E1>n Franco, and Shamit Kachru |year=2007 |month=January |title=Gauge/gravity duality and meta-stable dynamical supersymmetry breaking |journal=Jhep0701:083,2007 |pages=24 and 26 |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1126-6708/2007/01/083/jhep012007083.pdf?request-id=lrc9b12D3BGpMQfQ2wi7Kg |accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref> For example, the article says: "For large P, the three-form fluxes are dilute, and the gradient of the Myers potential encouraging an anti-D3 to embiggen is very mild." Later this usage was noted in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', which explained that in this context, it means ''to grow or expand''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7154/full/448632a.html |title=Sidelines |accessdate=2009-03-06 |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=2007-08-08}}</ref>

''Cromulent'' is an adjective that was coined by [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]]<!--He called himself David S. Cohen while working on The Simpsons-->.<ref name="Oakley"/> Since it was coined it has appeared in Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon.<ref name="cromulent">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=cromulent |title=cromulent definition |accessdate=2011-07-24 |work=[[Reference.com]] |publisher=[[Dictionary.com, LLC]]}}</ref> The meaning of ''cromulent'' is inferred only from its usage, which indicates that it is a positive attribute. Dictionary.com defines it as meaning ''fine'' or ''acceptable''.<ref name="cromulent"/> [[Ben Macintyre]] has written that it means "valid or acceptable".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Macintyre|title=Last word: Any word that embiggens the vocabulary is cromulent with me|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=2007-08-11|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2234263.ece | location=London}}</ref>

The episode received positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson lauded it for the focus on Lisa, commenting that "Lisa-centered episodes tend to be preachy, but I suppose that<U+2019>s inevitable given her character. I like the fact Lisa takes the high road here, though, as she proves she doesn<U+2019>t always have to be right.
