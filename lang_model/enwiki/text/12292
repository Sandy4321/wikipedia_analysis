==History==
In 2008, Jonas Liepmann, at the time a student of [[Cultural Studies]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], created iversity as an LMS-alternative for students and professors. In 2011, Hannes Kl<U+00F6>pper and Jonas Liepmann founded iversity as a [[GmbH]] after receiving funding from the EXist-Founder Scholarship through the [[BMWi]] (Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology) and the [[European Union|EU]]. In 2012 iversity evolved into an online platform for MOOCs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Sara|title=American MOOC Providers Face International Competition|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/american-mooc-providers-face-international-competition/44637|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=5 July 2013}}</ref> 
Marcus Riecke joined the team and invested in the company together with the existing investors, Masoud Kamali and T-Venture, the venture arm of [[Deutsche Telekom]] AG.
In 2013, Hannes Kl<U+00F6>pper <ref>{{cite news|title=5 Questions With An EdTech Startup: Hannes Kl<U+00F6>pper of Berlin-based MOOC provider <U+2018>iversity|url=http://www.wiredacademic.com/2013/07/5-questions-with-an-edtech-startup-hannes-klopper-of-berlin-based-mooc-provider-iversity/|newspaper=Wired Academic|date=4 July 2013}}</ref> and Marcus Riecke <ref>{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=Nina|title=Online education platform Iversity raises funding from T-Venture and new CEO|url=http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-raises-funding|newspaper=Venture Village|date=16 January 2013}}</ref> served as Managing Directors of iversity. Jonas Liepmann left the company in mid-2013 and Marcus Riecke joined the newly created Advisory Board in December. [[:de:J<U+00F6>rg Dr<U+00E4>ger|J<U+00F6>rg Dr<U+00E4>ger]], PhD, the Managing Director for the Centre of Higher Education (CHE), board member of the [[Bertelsmann Foundation]] for Education and who served as the Science Senator for the city-state of [[Hamburg]], also joined the Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: iversity creates Advisory Board|url=https://iversity.org/pages/advisory-board|publisher=iversity}}</ref> Since then the company is led by Hannes Kl<U+00F6>pper.

==MOOC Production Fellowship==
iversity, in cooperation with the [[Stifterverband f<U+00FC>r die Deutsche Wissenschaft]], ran the MOOC Production Fellowship in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=Nina|title=Professors, want to teach online? Berlin<U+2019>s Iversity offers ten <U+20AC>25,000 MOOC fellowships|url=http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-stifterverband-mooc-fellowship|newspaper=Venture Village|date=11 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Blumenstyk|first=Goldie|title=Company Offers Cash Prizes to Lure Professors to Teach MOOCs|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/company-offers-cash-prizes-to-lure-professors-to-teach-moocs/43583?cid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=25 April 2013}}</ref> <U+20AC>250,000 was set aside to fund the production of 10 MOOCs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Winkler|first=Kirsten|title=MOOC Production Fellowship announces Winners|url=http://www.edukwest.com/mooc-production-fellowship-announces-winners/|newspaper=Edukwest|date=10 June 2013}}</ref> Half of the fellowship spots were reserved for courses given in German. 250 professors applied and a total of 100,000 votes were submitted from around the world. The judging panel included, among others, [[:de:J<U+00F6>rg Dr<U+00E4>ger|J<U+00F6>rg Dr<U+00E4>ger]], PhD, board member of the [[Bertelsmann Foundation]] for Education, [[:de:J<U+00FC>rgen Kluge|Prof. J<U+00FC>rgen Kluge]], expert in [[innovation management]], and [[:de:J<U+00F6>rn Loviscach|Prof. J<U+00F6>rn Loviscach]], a lecturer at [[Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences]] and - along with Christian Spannagel - the main representative of inverted learning, or [[flip teaching]], in Germany.

==Courses==
The courses offered on the iversity platform are created by the professor, with technical and didactical support from iversity. As opposed to the [[MOOC]] platforms in the US, iversity does not focus on elite universities, but rather the study field, subject and didactical qualifications of each team and professor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Winkler|first=Kirsten|title=European MOOCs Focus on Quality, US MOOCs on Cost <U+2013> Interview with iversity<U+2019>s Hannes Kl<U+00F6>pper|url=http://edukwest.eu/european-moocs-focus-on-quality-us-moocs-on-cost-interview-with-iversitys-hannes-klopper/|newspaper=Edukwest Europe|date=25 July 2013}}</ref> Current partners include, but are not limited to: [[KU Leuven]], [[Universidad Autonoma de Madrid]], the [[University of Florence]], [[RWTH Aachen University]], the [[University of Hamburg]] and the [[Pratt Institute]] in New York.

The course catalogue on iversity extends beyond the 10 MOOC Production Fellowship winners. These courses include, but are not limited to, subjects on: [[DNA]], [[Dark Matter]], [[Medicine]], [[Storytelling]], [[Internet Privacy]], [[Web Engineering]], [[Architecture]], [[Math]], [[Statistics]], [[Algorithms]], [[Finance]], [[Political Philosophy]], [[Social Entrepreneurship]], [[Business]], [[Marketing]] and [[Agricultural Science]]. Courses are free and open for anyone to enrol and participate. The courses on iversity include short online video lectures, quizzes, assignments and exams.

==Course Structure==
Courses are open and free to anyone. Course levels vary from introductory level to final year undergraduate level. Some courses may recommend previous knowledge on the subject.

Courses consist of chapters, units and assessments. A [[MOOC]] is typically made up of 8 chapters. One chapter is released per week. Each chapter contains 6-10 units. These units provide video lectures, 3<U+2013>8 minutes long, interspersed with interactive quizzes and homework. Should the instructor wish, there may be peer-to-peer reviews and group projects. There is normally an exam at the end of each course.<ref>{{cite web|title=What learning at iversity looks like: Breaking down the 90 minute lecture|url=https://iversity.org/blog/learning-iversity-looks-like-breaking-90-minute-lecture/|publisher=iversity}}</ref>

Discussion forums make up a large part of the course infrastructure. Students can fully participate and even moderate the forums by posting questions, answers and comments, as well as voting discussion items <U+201C>up<U+201D> or <U+201C>down<U+201D> in the feed. Professors can also participate and vote in the discussion feed.<ref>{{cite web|title=User Interaction: What learning at iversity looks like|url=https://iversity.org/blog/user-interaction-learning-iversity-looks-like-iii/}}</ref>

==ECTS Credits==
Based on the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS), three iversity MOOCs offer [[ECTS-credits|ECTS credits]] to those who successfully complete the course.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parr|first=Chris|title=Europe hopes for common Mooc market and single currency|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/europe-hopes-for-common-mooc-market-and-single-currency/2008213.article|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=17 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=European credits for MOOCs|url=http://www.scienceguide.nl/201309/european-credits-for-moocs.aspx|newspaper=Science Guide|date=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ECTS for MOOCs on iversity|url=https://iversity.org/blog/ects-credits-moocs-iversity/|publisher=iversity}}</ref> The MOOCs can be taken remotely, but the final examination must be taken in each respective university campus for the credits to be awarded.
