'''Tudor Vladimirescu''' (c. [[1780]] - {{OldStyleDate|June 7|1821 May 27}}) was a [[Wallachia]]n [[Romania]]n revolutionary hero, the leader of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and of the [[Pandur]] [[militia]]. He is also known as '''Tudor din Vladimiri''' (''Tudor of Vladimiri'') or - seldomly - as '''Domnul Tudor''' (''[[Voivode]] Tudor'').

==Background== 
Tudor was born in [[Vladimiri]], [[Gorj County]] (in the region of [[Oltenia]]) in a family of landed peasants (''mazili''); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to [[Craiova]], in service to [[boyar]] [[Ioan Glogoveanu]], where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the [[Greek language]]. He became administrator of the boyar's estate and, in [[1806]], was named ''[[v<U+0103>taf]]'' (leader of the local militias) at [[Clo<U+015F>ani]]. Tudor's experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped him walk the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the [[Phanariotes]]. It is argued that Vladimirescu's vitriolic outbursts against "''[[Greeks]]''" (foreign, newly arrived landowners) and "''traitorous boyars''" (the group who did not give him support) were also motivated by his ambition towards being included into the ranks of local [[Estate (house)|estate]]-holders; while leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, ruthlessly punishing any destruction of property. 

Tudor enrolled in the [[History of Russia|Russian]] army and took part in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812]]. Consequently, he was awarded the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] 3rd degree and given Russian protection and [[Immunity (legal)|immunity from prosecution]] under both [[Wallachia]]n and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] legislation (''see [[Sudi<U+0163>i]]''). This contributed to Tudor's decisions throughout the uprising, alongside his belief that Russia was backing his actions. After the war, Tudor returned to Oltenia. He traveled briefly to [[Vienna]], in [[1814]], in order to attend a [[lawsuit]] involving Glogoveanu's wife [[patrimony]]. The trip coincided with the [[Congress of Vienna|Peace Congress]], and it is believed that Vladimirescu followed the treaties' outcome.

From [[1812]] to 1821, Vladimirescu slowly built a follower base. The Pandurs respected his military skills, and many sources point out his [[charisma]] and outstanding negotiating abilities. He would also have been familiarised with the outcomes of the [[First Serbian Uprising|First]] and [[Second Serbian Uprising]].

==The uprising==
[[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexandru Su<U+0163>u]]'s death in January 1821 led to the forming of a temporary ''Comitet de Oc<U+00E2>rmuire'' ("Governing Committee"), three [[regents]] - all of them members of the most representative indigenous boyar families, of which the most prominent was ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' [[Grigore Br<U+00E2>ncoveanu]]. The ''Comitet'', motivated against competition and denied Phanariote rulers' favours, decided to quickly manoeuver anti-boyar and anti-Phanariote sentiment in Wallachia (and especially in Oltenia), acting before the newly appointed [[Scarlat Callimachi]] could claim his throne. Therefore, an agreement between it and the Pandurs was reached on the [[January 15|15th]]: [[Dimitrie Macedonski]] was awarded the post of lieutenant to Tudor.

The very same day, Vladimirescu sent a letter to the Ottoman Court of [[Mahmud II]], stating that his objective was not the rejection of Ottoman rule, but that of the Phanariote [[regime]], and showing his willingness for preservation of the traditional institutions. The statements were meant to buy Tudor time against Ottoman response, as he was already in negotiations with the Greek Anti-Ottoman revolutionary society [[Philik<U+00ED> Etaire<U+00ED>a]] (having probably been in contact with it from around [[1819]]). Together, they produced a plan for [[insurrection]], with the two Eterist representatives ([[Giorgakis Olympios]] and [[Iannis Pharmakis|Ioan Farmache]]) assuring the Wallachians of Russian support for the common cause. It is apparent that Tudor was not himself a member of the Etaire<U+00ED>a: the rigid command structure of the Brotherhood would have excluded the need for any negotiations.

After fortifying monasteries in Oltenia ([[Tismana]], [[Strehaia]]) that were to serve him in the event of Ottoman intervention, Tudor travelled to [[Pade<U+015F>]] where he issued his first proclamation ([[January 23]]). It included references to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles (notably, the [[Right of revolution|right to resist oppression]]), but was also an almost [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] appeal to peasants, promising a "spring" to follow "winter".

In February, the demands were detailed by more documents. They included: the elimination of purchased offices in the administration, with the introduction of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] promotion, the suppression of certain taxes and taxing criteria, the reduction of the main tax, the founding of a [[Wallachian Army]], and an end to internal [[customs|custom duties]]. In line with these, Tudor asked for the [[banishment]] of some Phanariote families and forbidding future Princes to hold a [[retinue]] that would compete with local boyars for offices. Calls by boyars in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]] for Tudor to cease such activities (expressed by envoy [[Nicolae V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]]) were met with a virulent refusal.

[[Image:Eteria Bucharest 1821.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Etaire<U+00ED>a and Ottomans fighting in Bucharest (August 1821).]]

The army, swelled up in numbers as it advanced, occupied [[Bucharest]] on [[March 21]] - here, Tudor issued another important proclamation, one that expressed yet again his commitment to peace with the Ottomans. Previously, the Philik<U+00ED> Etaire<U+00ED>a under [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] had emerged in [[Moldavia]], proclaiming a liberation from Ottoman rule that was backed by the then Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Mihail Su<U+0163>u]] (''see [[Greek War of Independence]]''). However, this coincided with Russian reaction against Greek rebellion, with the Russian army entering Moldavia and enforcing 
[[Holy Alliance]] policies. Ypsilanti's army headed south, reaching Pandur-occupied Bucharest.

Tudor's actions in the meanwhile had destroyed his alliance to local boyars. He had started wearing the ''kalpak'' (a tall, cylindrical, black leather hat; ''see [[Ottoman Clothing]]'') reserved for the Prince, and demanded to be addressed as ''Domn'' ("Master", "Prince"; cf. ''[[Domnitor]]'') - moving away from subordination to the landowners' cause.

The meeting between Ypsilanti and Tudor brought a new compromise. Tudor considered himself liberated from the provisions of the January agreement, as Russia was now an enemy of the Etaire<U+00ED>a; Ypsilanti tried to persuade him that Russian support was still possible. The country was divided into a Greek administration and a Wallachian one, with Tudor's declaring itself neutral in the face of large Ottoman armies preparing to cross the north of the [[Danube]]. Ottoman actions had been prompted by Russian threat of intervention in Wallachia.

Tudor's army retreated towards Oltenia in May, as the Ottomans occupied Bucharest without meeting resistance. Tudor was no longer capable of maintaining the discipline and cohesion of his own troops, and an attempt to ensure these through selective hangings only served to win him the fear of his subordinates. There was general apathy when his willingness for a compromise with the Ottoman Empire caused him to be arrested (by the same Olimpiotul and Farmache, on [[June 1]], in [[Gole<U+015F>ti]]), tried and executed by the Etaire<U+00ED>a, in [[T<U+00E2>rgovi<U+015F>te]]. He was tortured, killed, and his mutilated body was thrown into a latrine. The Etaire<U+00ED>a did not succeed in its goal to assume command of Vladimirescu's army: most of it disbanded on the spot, with only a handful opposing Ottoman presence, and only up to August.

Tudor's rebellion ensured that Wallachia would stay under military occupation. Although the situation was stabilized by August, Ottoman troops remained present until [[1826]]. However, as they could no longer trust Phanariote rule in the face of its infiltration by Greek [[nationalism]] (Ypsilanti himself came from a Phanariote family - ''see  [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1725-1805)|Alexandru Ipsilanti]], his grandfather, and [[Constantine Ypsilanti|Constantin Ipsilanti]], his father''), the Ottomans returned the two Principalities to rule by and through locals (in [[1822]]): [[Grigore IV Ghica]] in Wallachia, [[Ioan Sturdza]] (Ioni<U+0163><U+0103> Sandu Sturdza) in Moldavia. The changes in the situation were to be confirmed by the [[Treaty of Adrianople]] and Russian occupation (at the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]]).

Although the scope of his movement appealed to generations of Romanian nationalists, Tudor Vladimirescu's most favorable treatment came with the official ideology of the ''Romanian People's Republic'' (the first period of [[Communist Romania]], lasting from [[1948]] to [[1965]]). He was considered [[Progressivism|progressive]], and it also contributed that he viewed himself as an ally to the Russian cause - almost as a precursor of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] alliance. 

A [[Division (military)|Division]] bearing his name (''Divizia Tudor Vladimirescu'') was formed by the [[Red Army]] with Romanian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who had fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. They were called on to fight the [[Ion Antonescu]] pro-[[Nazi Germany]] regime, and were absorbed into the [[Romanian Army]] after [[1944]]. The Division had its precedent in an [[artillery battery]] of the same name, grouping Romanian volunteers in the [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. An [[Order of Tudor Vladmirescu]] was also created.
