==Coaching career==
Henderson served as an assistant to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven season as the coach at [[Northwestern University]]. Northwestern is not known for having the most athletic players in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. As a result, Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'': "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing that bothers me is that he's faster than all of them."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1164552/index.htm|title=The Seven-decade Itch|accessdate=2011-04-28|date=2010-01-11|author=Ballard, Chris|work=CNN}}</ref> During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the [[National Invitation Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/031709aab.html|title=Big Ten Men's Basketball Prepares for Postseason: Record-tying seven Big Ten teams selected to participate in NCAA Championship|accessdate=2011-04-28|date=2009-03-17|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/031810aaa.html|title=Men's Basketball Release: Week 19: Five teams earn NCAA Tournament berths|accessdate=2011-04-28|date=2010-03-18|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/031411aab.html|title=Big Ten Men's Basketball Postseason Release - March 14, 2011: Big Ten ties conference record with seven teams selected for NCAA Tournament|accessdate=2011-04-28|date=2011-03-14|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref>
