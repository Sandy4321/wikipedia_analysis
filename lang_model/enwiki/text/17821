{{Ancient Mesopotamia}}
'''Babylonia''' was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with [[Babylon]] as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. ca. 1728 <U+2013> 1686 BC, [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkad]]. The Amorites being a [[Semitic]] people, Babylonia adopted the written Semitic [[Akkadian language]] for official use, and retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. 

The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the [[23rd century BC]].

==History==
During [[Sumer]]ian times, the Amorites were a nomadic tribe in the Arabian desert west of the Euphrates, frequently raiding the Mesopotamian cities, and were regarded as uncivilized by the more settled, crop-growing, Mesopotamians. Nevertheless, groups of Amorites gradually settled in the area, and ultimately adopted Akkadian and Sumerian culture.

Following the collapse of the last Sumerian "[[Ur-III]]" dynasty at the hands of the [[Elam]]ites (ca. 1940 ([[short chronology|short]])), the [[Amorite]]s gained control over most of Mesopotamia, where they formed a series of small kingdoms.  During the first centuries of what is called the "Amorite period", the most powerful city states were [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]], although [[Shamshi-Adad I]] came close to uniting the more northern regions around [[Assur]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. One of these Amorite dynasties was established in the [[city-state]] of [[Babylon]], which would ultimately take over the others and form the first Babylonian empire, during what is also called the [[Old Babylonian]] Period.

===Old Babylonian period===
[[Image:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg<U+200E>|right|300px|thumb|The extent of the Babylonian Empire at the start and end of Hammurabi's reign]]
{{main|First Babylonian Dynasty}}

The city of Babylon obtained hegemony over Mesopotamia under its sixth ruler, [[Hammurabi]] (fl. ca. 1728 <U+2013> 1686 BC ([[short chronology|short]])). He was a very efficient ruler, establishing a bureaucracy, with taxation and centralized government, and giving the region stability after turbulent times, thereby transforming it into the central power of Mesopotamia. One of the most important works of this "[[First Dynasty of Babylon]]", as it was called by the native historians, was the compilation of [[Babylonian law|a code of laws]]. This was made by order of Hammurabi after the expulsion of the [[Elam]]ites and the settlement of his kingdom. In 1901, a copy of the [[Code of Hammurabi]] was discovered on a [[stele]] by [[J. De Morgan]] and [[V. Scheil]] at [[Susa]], where it had later been taken as plunder. That copy is now in the Louvre.

Babylonian beliefs held the king as an agent of [[Marduk]], and the city of Babylon as a "holy city" where any legitimate ruler of Mesopotamia had to be crowned{{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

The Babylonians, like their predecessors, engaged in regular trade with city-states to the west; with Babylonian officials or troops sometimes passing to Syria and Canaan, and Amorite merchants operating throughout Mesopotamia. The Babylonian monarchy's western connections remained strong for quite some time. An Amorite named Abi-ramu or Abram was the father of a witness to a deed dated to the reign of Hammurabi's grandfather; [[Ammi-Ditana]], great-grandson of Hammurabi, still titled himself "king of the land of the Amorites". Ammi-Ditana's father and son also bore Canaanite names: [[Abi-Eshuh]] and [[Ammi-Saduqa|Ammisaduqa]]. {{Fact|date=June 2008}}

The armies of Babylonia were well-disciplined, and conquered the city-states of [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Uruk]], and the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. But Mesopotamia had no natural, defensible boundaries, making it vulnerable to attack. Trade and culture thrived for around 150 years, until the reign of the 15th king of the first dynasty, [[Samsu-Ditana]], son of [[Ammisaduqa]]. He was overthrown following the "sack of Babylon" by the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I]], and Babylonia was turned over to the [[Kassites]], with whom [[Samsu-Iluna]] had already come into conflict in his 6th year.

====The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology====
The date of the sack of Babylon by the Hittite king [[Mursilis I]] is considered crucial to the various calculations of the early [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]], since both a solar and a lunar eclipse are said to have occurred in the month of [[Sivan]] that year, according to ancient records.

The fall of Babylon is taken as a fixed point in the discussion of the [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]]. Suggestions for its precise date vary by as much as 150 years, corresponding to the uncertainty regarding the length of the "Dark Age" of the ensuing [[Bronze Age collapse]], resulting in the shift of the entire Bronze Age chronology of Mesopotamia with regard to the [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]]. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are:
*ultra-short chronology: 1499 BC
*short chronology: 1531 BC
*middle chronology: 1595 BC
*long chronology: 1651 BC

===Kassite period===
[[Image:Kassite Babylonia EN.svg<U+200E>|right|300px|thumb|The extent of the Babylonian Empire during the Kassite dynasty]]
{{main|Kassites}}
{{Disputed|date=May 2008}}
The Kassite dynasty was founded by Kandis or Gandash of Mari. The Kassites renamed Babylon "''Kar-Duniash''", and their rule lasted for 576 years. This foreign dominion offers a striking analogy to the roughly contemporary rule of the [[Hyksos]] in [[ancient Egypt]]. Babylonia having lost its empire over western Asia, the high-priests of [[Assur|Ashur]] made themselves kings of [[Assyria]]. Most divine attributes ascribed to the Semitic kings of Babylonia disappeared at this time; the title of God was never given to a Kassite sovereign. However, Babylon continued to be the capital of the kingdom and the 'holy' city of western Asia, where the priests were all-powerful, and the only place where the right to inheritance of the old Babylonian empire could be conferred.

Despite the loss of territory, and evident reduction in literacy and culture, the Kassite dynasty was the longest-lived dynasty of Babylon, lasting until 1155 BC ([[short chronology|short]]), when Babylon was conquered by [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] of [[Elam]], and re-conquered a few years later by [[Nebuchadrezzar I]], part of the larger [[Bronze Age collapse]].

===Early Iron Age===
In the [[Early Iron Age]], from 1125 to 732 BC, Babylon was again ruled by native dynasties, beginning with [[Nebuchadrezzar I]] of [[Isin]] (Dynasty IV).

Dynasty IX begins with [[Nabonassar]], whose rule (from 748 BC) heads Ptolemy's [[Canon of Kings]].

In 729 BC, Babylon was conquered into the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] by [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] and remained under Assyrian rule for a century, until the 620s BC revolt of [[Nabopolassar]].

===Neo-Babylonian Empire (Chaldean Era)===
[[Image:Median Empire.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Middle East, c. 600 BC, showing extent of Chaldean rule.]]
{{main|Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldea}}

Through the centuries of Assyrian domination, Babylonia enjoyed a prominent status, or revolted at the slightest indication that it did not.  The Assyrians always managed to restore Babylonian loyalty, however, whether through granting of increased privileges, or militarily.  That finally changed in 627 BC with the death of the last strong Assyrian ruler, [[Ashurbanipal]], and Babylonia rebelled under [[Nabopolassar]] the [[Chaldean]] the following year.  With help from the [[Medes]], [[Nineveh]] was sacked in 612 BC, and the seat of empire was again transferred to Babylonia.

Nabopolassar was followed by his son [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar II]], whose reign of 43 years made Babylon once more the mistress of the civilized world, including the conquering of [[Phoenicia]] in 585 BC.<ref>{{cite web | title=World Wide School |work=History of Phoenicia - Part IV  | url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/ancient/HistoryofPhoenicia/chap22.html | accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref> Only a small fragment of his annals has been discovered, relating to his invasion of Egypt in 567 BC, and referring to "Phut of the Ionians".

Of the reign of the last Babylonian king, [[Nabonidus]] (''Nabu-na'id''), and the conquest of Babylonia by [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], there is a fair amount of information available. This is chiefly derived from a chronological tablet containing the annals of Nabonidus, supplemented by another inscription of Nabonidus where he recounts his restoration of the temple of the Moon-god at [[Harran]]; as well as by a proclamation of Cyrus issued shortly after his formal recognition as king of Babylonia. It was in the sixth year of Nabonidus (549 BC) that Cyrus, the Achaemenid Persian "king of [[Anshan]]" in Elam, revolted against his suzerain [[Astyages]], "king of the Manda" or [[Medes]], at [[Ecbatana]]. Astyages' army betrayed him to his enemy, and Cyrus established himself at Ecbatana, thus putting an end to the empire of the Medes. Three years later Cyrus had become king of all Persia, and was engaged in a campaign in northern Mesopotamia. Meanwhile, Nabonidus had established a camp in the desert, near the southern frontier of his kingdom, leaving his son [[Belshazzar]] (''Belsharutsur'') in command of the army.

In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was fought at [[Opis]] in the month of June, where the Babylonians were defeated; and immediately afterwards [[Sippara]] surrendered to the invader. Nabonidus fled to Babylon, where he was pursued by [[Gobryas]], and on the 16th day of ''Tammuz'', two days after the capture of Sippara, "the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting." Nabonidus was dragged from his hiding-place, where the services continued without interruption. Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of ''Marchesvan'' (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence. Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon, and a few days afterwards the son of Nabonidus died. A public mourning followed, lasting six days, and Cambyses accompanied the corpse to the tomb.

Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of [[Bel-Marduk]], who was assumed to be wrathful at the impiety of Nabonidus in removing the images of the local gods from their ancestral shrines to his capital Babylon. Nabonidus, in fact, had excited a strong feeling against himself by attempting to centralize the religion of Babylonia in the temple of Merodach (Marduk) at Babylon, and while he had thus alienated the local priesthoods, the military party despised him on account of his antiquarian tastes. He seems to have left the defense of his kingdom to others, occupying himself with the more congenial work of excavating the foundation records of the temples and determining the dates of their builders.

The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless facilitated by the existence of a disaffected party in the state, as well as by the presence of foreign forced exiles like the [[Jews]], who had been planted in the midst of the country. One of the first acts of Cyrus accordingly was to allow these exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them the images of their gods and their sacred vessels. The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation, whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne. The feeling was still strong that none had a right to rule over western Asia until he had been consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests; and accordingly, Cyrus henceforth assumed the imperial title of "King of Babylon."

===Persian Babylonia===
{{see|Persian Mesopotamia}}

Babylonia was absorbed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC. 

A year before Cyrus' death, in 529 BC, he elevated his son [[Cambyses II]] in the government, making him king of Babylon, while he reserved for himself the fuller title of "king of the (other) provinces" of the empire. It was only when [[Darius Hystaspis]] acquired the Persian throne and ruled it as a representative of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]], that the old tradition was broken and the claim of Babylon to confer legitimacy on the rulers of western Asia ceased to be acknowledged. 

Immediately after Darius seized Persia, Babylonia briefly recovered its independence under Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of [[Nebuchadnezzar|Nebuchadnezzar III]], and reigned from October 522 BC to August 520 BC, when Darius took the city by storm. A few years later, probably 514 BC, Babylon again revolted under [[Arakha]]; on this occasion, after its capture by the Persians, the walls were partly destroyed. E-Saggila, the great temple of Bel, however, still continued to be kept in repair and to be a center of Babylonian religious feelings.

It has long been maintained that the foundation of [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]] diverted the population to the new capital of Babylonia, and that the ruins of the old city became a quarry for the builders of the new seat of government, but the recent publication of the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Babylonian Chronicles of the Hellenistic Period]] has shown that urban life was still very much the same well into the Parthian age.

The name of the [[satrapy]] was changed to [[Asuristan]] in the [[Sassanid]] period. Excepting brief interludes of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest ([[Roman Assyria]], [[Roman Mesopotamia]]; AD 116 to 118), and a longer period of [[Hellenistic]] rule (the [[Seleucid Empire]], 330 to 250 BC), Mesopotamia remained under Persian control until the [[Islamic conquest of Persian Mesopotamia|Islamic conquest]] in the 630s AD.

==Achievements==
===Art and Architecture===
{{see|Art and architecture of Babylonia and Assyria}}

In Babylonia, an abundance of [[clay]], and lack of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], led to greater use of [[mudbrick]]; Babylonian temples are massive structures of crude brick, supported by [[buttress]]es, the rain being carried off by drains. One such drain at [[Ur]] was made of lead. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and column, and of [[fresco]]es and enamelled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with [[zinc]] or gold, as well as with tiles. Painted ''[[terra-cotta]]'' cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster.

In Babylonia, in place of the [[bas-relief]], there is greater use of three-dimensional figures in the round &mdash; the earliest examples being the statues from [[Telloh]], that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting.

The legendary [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and the [[Tower of Babel]] are seen as symbols of luxurious and arrogant power respectively.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

===Astronomy===
{{main|Babylonian astronomy}}

Among the sciences, [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]] occupied a conspicuous place in Babylonian society. Astronomy was of old standing in Babylonia, and the standard work on the subject, written from an astrological point of view, later translated into [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Berossus]], was believed to date from the age of [[Sargon of Akkad]]. The [[zodiac]] was a Babylonian invention of great antiquity; and [[eclipses]] of the [[sun]] and [[moon]] could be foretold. There are dozens of cuneiform records of original Mesopotamian eclipse observations (see Wikipedia's "Chronology of Babylonia and Assyria").<ref>{{cite web | title=Chronology of Babylonia and Assyria |work=Wikipedia web page  | url=http://encyclopedia-online.info/Chronology_of_Babylonia_and_Assyria}}</ref> [[Observatories]] were attached to the temples, and reports were regularly sent by astronomers to the king. The stars had been numbered and named at an early date, and we possess tables of lunar longitudes and observations of [[Venus]]. Great attention was naturally paid to the [[calendar]], and we find a [[week]] of seven days and another of five days in use.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Babylonian astrology was based on the belief that the entire [[universe]] was created in relation to the [[earth]]. Thus the ancients saw it as no accident that the [[stars]] and [[planets]] were set in a certain divine order at the time of [[Creation myth|creation]].

The first evidence of recognition that astronomical phenomena are periodic and of the application of mathematics to their prediction is Babylonian. Tablets dating back to the [[Old Babylonian period]] document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year. Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of [[cuneiform]] tablets known as the 'En<U+016B>ma Anu Enlil'. The oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet 63 of 'En<U+016B>ma Anu Enlil', the Venus tablet of [[Ammi-saduqa]], which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years and is the earliest evidence that the phenomena of a planet were recognized as periodic. The oldest rectangular [[astrolabe]] dates back to Babylonia ''ca.'' 1100 BC. The [[MUL.APIN]], contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting [[heliacal rising]]s and the settings of the planets, lengths of daylight measured by a [[water-clock]], [[gnomon]], shadows, and [[intercalation]]s. The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right-ascensions or time-intervals, and also employs the stars of the zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Pingree|1998}}<br>{{Harvtxt|Rochberg|2004}}<br>{{Harvtxt|Evans|1998}}</ref>

During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy. They began studying [[philosophy]] dealing with the ideal nature of the early [[universe]] and began empoying an [[Consistency proof|internal logic]] within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the [[philosophy of science]] and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.<ref name=Brown>D. Brown (2000), ''Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology '', Styx Publications, ISBN 9056930362.</ref> This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.

In [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid]] and [[Parthia]]n times, the astronomical reports were of a thoroughly scientific character; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain. The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the [[History of Astronomy#Mesopotamia|history of astronomy]].

The only Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of planetary motion was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. [[190 BC]]).<ref>[[Otto E. Neugebauer]] (1945). "The History of Ancient Astronomy Problems and Methods", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''4''' (1), p. 1-38.</ref><ref>[[George Sarton]] (1955). "Chaldaean Astronomy of the Last Three Centuries B. C.", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''75''' (3), p. 166-173 [169].</ref><ref>William P. D. Wightman (1951, 1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas'', Yale University Press  p.38.</ref> Seleucus is known from the writings of [[Plutarch]]. He supported the heliocentric theory where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotated]] around its own axis which in turn revolved around the [[Sun]]. According to [[Plutarch]], Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used.

Babylonian astronomy was the basis for much of what was done in [[Greek astronomy|Greek and Hellenistic astronomy]], in classical [[Indian astronomy]], in [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Syria]]n astronomy, in medieval [[Islamic astronomy]], and in [[Central Asia]]n and [[Western Europe]]an astronomy.<ref name=dp1998>{{Harvtxt|Pingree|1998}}</ref>

===Mathematics===
{{Main|Babylonian mathematics}}
The Babylonian system of mathematics was [[sexagesimal]], or a base 60 [[numeral system]] (see: [[Babylonian numerals]]). From this we derive the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle. The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. First, the number 60 has many [[divisor]]s (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30), making calculations easier.  Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as in our base-ten system: 734 = 7<U+00D7>100 + 3<U+00D7>10 + 4<U+00D7>1). Among the Babylonians' mathematical accomplishments were the determination of the [[square root of two]] correctly to seven places ([http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html YBC 7289 clay tablet]). They also demonstrated knowledge of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] well before Pythagoras, as evidenced by this tablet translated by Dennis Ramsey and dating to ca. 1900 BC:
<blockquote>
4 is the length and 5 is the diagonal.
What is the breadth?
Its size is not known.
4 times 4 is 16. And 5 times 5 is 25.
You take 16 from 25 and there remains 9.
What times what shall I take in order to get 9?
3 times 3 is 9. 3 is the breadth.
</blockquote>

The ''ner'' of 600 and the ''sar'' of 3600 were formed from the unit of 60, corresponding with a degree of the [[equator]]. Tablets of squares and cubes, calculated from 1 to 60, have been found at [[Senkera]], and a people acquainted with the sun-dial, the clepsydra, the lever and the pulley, must have had no mean knowledge of mechanics. A crystal lens, turned on the lathe, was discovered by [[Austen Henry Layard]] at [[Nimrud]] along with glass vases bearing the name of Sargon; this could explain the excessive minuteness of some of the writing on the [[Assyria]]n tablets, and a lens may also have been used in the observation of the heavens.

The Babylonians might have been familiar with the general rules for measuring the areas. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if <U+03C0> were estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used <U+03C0> as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time. (Eves, Chapter 2)

===Medicine===
The oldest Babylonian texts on [[medicine]] date back to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] in the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]]. The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by the physician [[Esagil-kin-apli]] of [[Borsippa]],<ref name=Stol-99/> during the reign of the [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian king]] [[Adad-apla-iddina]] (1069-1046 BC).<ref>Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 55, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 9072371631.</ref>

Along with contemporary [[ancient Egyptian medicine]], the Babylonians introduced the concepts of [[diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], [[physical examination]], and [[prescription]]s. In addition, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' introduced the methods of [[therapy]] and [[aetiology]] and the use of [[empiricism]], [[logic]] and [[rationality]] in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical [[symptom]]s and often detailed empirical [[observation]]s along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a [[patient]] with its diagnosis and prognosis.<ref>H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 97-98, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 9004136665.</ref>

The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as [[bandage]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]]s and [[pill]]s. If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on [[exorcism]] to cleanse the patient from any [[curse]]s. Esagil-kin-apli's ''Diagnostic Handbook'' was based on a logical set of [[axiom]]s and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and [[inspection]] of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's [[disease]], its aetiology and future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery.<ref name=Stol-99>H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 99, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 9004136665.</ref>

Esagil-kin-apli discovered a variety of [[illness]]es and diseases and described their symptoms in his ''Diagnostic Handbook''. These include the symptoms for many varieties of [[epilepsy]] and related [[ailment]]s along with their diagnosis and prognosis.<ref>Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 5, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 9072371631.</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main|Babylonian literature}}
There were libraries in most towns and temples; an old [[Sumer]]ian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn." Women as well as men learned to read and write, and in Semitic times, this involved knowledge of the extinct [[Sumerian language]], and a complicated and extensive syllabary.

A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Sumer. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists of them were drawn up.

There are many Babylonian literary works whose titles have come down to us. One of the most famous of these was the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain Sin-liqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of [[Gilgamesh]]. The whole story is a composite product, and it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure.

===Philosophy===
:''Further information: [[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]''

The origins of Babylonian [[philosophy]] can be traced back to early Mesopotamian [[wisdom]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialog]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. Babylonian [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47.</ref>

It is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], particularly [[Hellenistic philosophy]]. The Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agonist]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]].<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47 [43].</ref> The [[Milesia]]n philosopher [[Thales]] is also known to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.

===Technology===
Babylonians invented many technologies, which include [[metalwork]]ing, [[copper]]-working, [[glass]]making, [[oil lamp|lamp]] making, [[textile|textile weaving]], flood control, and water storage, as well as [[irrigation]]. Earlier on they used [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[gold]], and later they used [[iron]]. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals.  Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for [[armor]] as well as for different weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[Mace (club)|maces]].

==Babylonia in culture==
Babylonia, and particularly its capital city Babylon, has long held a place in [[Abrahamic religion]]s as a symbol of excess and dissolute power.  Many references are made to Babylon in the [[Bible]], both literally and allegorically.  The mentions in the [[Tanakh]] tend to be historical or prophetic, while [[Babylon (New Testament)|New Testament references]] are more likely figurative, or cryptic references to pagan Rome.  The legendary [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and the [[Tower of Babel]] are seen as symbols of luxurious and arrogant power respectively.
