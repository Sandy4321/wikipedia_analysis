* ''[[About.com]]'' (2011) - 4 Stars. - "Their sixth full-length release ''The Lay of Thrym'' is full of epic and majestic elements of Faroese traditional music with Nordic pride."

* ''Metal Psalter'' (June 7, 2011) - 4 Stars. - "T<U+00FD>r has done a pretty good job of remaining consistent while working in a change to a faster sound, as evidenced by ''The Lay of Thyrm''."

* ''Rockfreaks.net'' (2011) - 6.5/10 - "It is that absence of the complexity, and with it the heart, of T<U+00FD>r which now feels missing through these largely identikit, catchy-as-you-like power/folk metal numbers."

* Several weeks after its release, and for the first time in T<U+00FD>r's career, The Lay Of Thrym jumped from #31 to #1 on CMJ Loud Rock radio charts, it remained there for two weeks.<ref>[http://www.napalmrecords.com/hp_charts.php] NAPALM RECORDS CHART ENTRIES</ref>
