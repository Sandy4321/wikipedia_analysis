During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of [[chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[software architect|chief software architect]], and remains the largest individual shareholder with more than 8 percent of the [[common stock]].<ref>Gates regularly documents his share ownership through public SEC form 4 filings.</ref> He has also authored or co-authored several books.

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. Although he is admired by many, a number of industry insiders [[Criticism of Microsoft|criticize his business tactics]], which they consider anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by the courts.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=459}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Lesinski|2006|p=96}}</ref> In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], established in 2000.

Bill Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to [[Ray Ozzie]], chief software architect and [[Craig Mundie]], chief research and strategy officer. Gates' last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He remains at Microsoft as non-executive chairman.

==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], Washington, to [[William H. Gates, Sr.]] and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]], of English, German, and Scottish-Irish descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Gates |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Scottish Americans |publisher = albawest.com | url = http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html | accessdate = April 29, 2009}}</ref> His family was upper middle class; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]], and her father, J. W. Maxwell, was a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had dropped his own "III" suffix.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=15}}</ref> Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=47}}</ref>

At 13 he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School]], an exclusive preparatory school.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=24}}</ref> When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's [[rummage sale]] to buy an [[ASR-33]] teletype terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=27}}</ref> Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he commented on it and said, "There was just something neat about the machine."<ref name = "dlzsnr">{{harv|Gates|1996|p=12}}</ref> After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students<U+2014>Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans<U+2014>for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the [[operating system]] to obtain free computer time.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=34}}</ref>

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[FORTRAN]], [[LISP]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[COBOL]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with mostly female students. He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."<ref name = "dlzsnr"/> At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.<ref>{{harv|Gates|1996|p=14}}</ref> In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>[http://www.ushpaa.org/history.php "Congressional Page History"], The United States House Page Association of America. "The Page Program has produced many politicians, Members of Congress, as well as other famous men and women. Some of these include: the Honorable John Dingell, the longest serving Member of Congress, Bill Gates, founder and CEO of the Microsoft Corporation, and Donnald K. Anderson, former Clerk of the House."</ref>

[[File:Bill Gates mugshot.png|thumb|Bill Gates' mugshot from a traffic violation in 1977]]
Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the [[SAT]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | title=The new<U+2014>and improved?<U+2014>SAT | accessdate = May 23, 2006 |work=The Week Magazine|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060510205250/http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 |archivedate = May 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> and enrolled at [[Harvard College]] in the autumn of 1973.<ref name = "wzxoxv">{{harv|Gates|1996|p=15}}</ref> While at Harvard, he met [[Steve Ballmer]], who later succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft.

==Microsoft==
{{Main|History of Microsoft|Microsoft}}
===BASIC===
[[Image:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|MITS Altair 8800 Computer with {{Convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} floppy disk system]]
After reading the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], Gates contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.<ref name="keyevents">{{cite paper | title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft | format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008}}</ref> In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,<ref name="thocp1">{{cite web | title=Microsoft history|publisher=The History of Computing Project | url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm | accessdate=March 31, 2008 }}</ref> and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.<ref name=thocp1/> Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.<ref name=thocp1/> Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=81}}</ref> This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.<ref name="thocp1" /> The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]] on January 1, 1979.<ref name="keyevents">{{cite web | title=Key Events In Microsoft History | url=http://www.microsoft.com/visitorcenter/student.mspx | accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}</ref>

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.<ref name="waterloo">{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx|last=Gates|first=Bill|title=Remarks by Bill Gates|date=October 13, 2005|location=Waterloo, Ontario|accessdate = March 31, 2008}}</ref>

===IBM partnership===
In 1980, [[IBM]] approached Microsoft to write the BASIC interpreter for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]]. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=[[Forbes]]|author=Maiello, John Steele Gordon Michael |date=December 23, 2002|accessdate =March 31, 2008}}</ref>
IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[IBM PC-DOS|PC-DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000. Gates did not offer to transfer the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.<ref>{{harv|Gates|1996|p=54}}</ref> They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.<ref>{{harv|Manes|1994|p=193}}</ref>

Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates President of Microsoft and the
Chairman of the Board.<ref name="keyevents" />

===Windows===
Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences undermined the partnership. Gates distributed an internal memo on May 16, 1991, announcing that the OS/2 partnership was over and Microsoft would shift its efforts to the [[Windows NT]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bralyn.net/etext/literature/bill.gates/challenges-strategy.txt | title=May 16, 1991 internal strategies memo from Bill Gates |publisher=Bralyn|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}</ref>

===Management style===
From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it.

As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.<ref name="rensin">{{cite journal|first=David|last=Rensin|title=The Bill Gates Interview|year=1994|journal=Playboy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx | title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&nbsp;<U+2014> Church Hill Club | first=Steve|last=Ballmer | date=October 9, 1997 |publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref>
He often interrupted presentations with such comments as, "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"<ref name="time GOS">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html | first=Walter | last=Isaacson | title=The Gates Operating System |work=Time | date=January 13, 1997 | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> and, "Why don't you just give up your [[Option (finance)|options]] and join the [[Peace Corps]]?"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | title=Breaking Windows |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | author= Bank, David|date=February 1, 1999 | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.<ref name="time GOS" /> When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."<ref name="chapman"/><ref name="pdc97">{{cite speech | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx | first=Bill | last=Gates | title=Remarks by Bill Gates | location=[[San Diego, California]] | date=September 26, 1997 | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref><ref name="herbold">{{cite book|first=Robert|year=2004|last=Herbold|title=The Fiefdom Syndrome: The Turf Battles That Undermine Careers and Companies <U+2013> And How to Overcome Them|isbn=0385510675}}</ref>

Gates's role at Microsoft for most of its history was primarily a management and executive role. However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company's [[programming language]] products. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100 line]], but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products.<ref name="pdc97"/> On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing [[Ray Ozzie]] in charge of day-to-day management and [[Craig Mundie]] in charge of long-term product strategy.<ref name="mscorpnews">{{cite news | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates |publisher=Microsoft|date=June 15, 2006}}</ref>

===Antitrust litigation===
{{See|United States Microsoft antitrust case|European Union Microsoft competition case}}
[[Image:Billgates.JPG|thumb|Bill Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words like "compete", "concerned" and "we".<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html|title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court|publisher=CNN|date=November 17, 1998}}</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' reported:

{{quotation|Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail Gates both sent and received.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm|title=Microsoft's Teflon Bill|work=BusinessWeek|date=November 30, 1998}}</ref>}}

Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."<ref name="truth">{{cite journal|last=Heilemann|first=John|title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth|date=November 1, 2000|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html|accessdate = March 31, 2008|month=May|author=Chen, Hy; Wu, Js; Hyland, B; Lu, Xd; Chen, Jj|volume=46|issue=8|page=833|pmid=18509686|doi=10.1007/s11517-008-0355-6}}</ref> Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]], and blocking competition, both in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref name="truth" />

===Appearance in ads===
Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft in 2008. The first commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in [[New Mexico]] in 1977 for a traffic violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |title=The Smoking Gun mugshots |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref> As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a yes, he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a yes. Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (''[[Seinfeld]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/08/1362333.aspx |title=MSNBC adblog site |publisher=Adblog.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref> In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.

==Post-Microsoft==
Since leaving Microsoft, Gates continues his philanthropy and, among other projects, purchased the videos rights to the [[Messenger Lectures]] series titled [[The Character of Physical Law]], given at [[Cornell University]] by [[Richard Feynman]] in 1964 and recorded by the BBC. The videos are available online to the public at Microsoft's [[Project Tuva]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fried |first=Ina |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10286732-56.html |title=CNET Project Tuva |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Access-Project-Tuva-for-Free-Courtesy-of-Bill-Gates-116778.shtml |title=Softpedia |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>

In April 2010, Gates was invited to visit and speak at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he asked the students to take on the hard problems of the world in their futures.<ref>Guo, Jeff; McQueen, Rob,
[http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N21/gates.html "Gates asks students to tackle world<U+2019>s problems : Disease and education among biggest challenges"], ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'', Volume 130, Issue 21, Friday, April 23, 2010</ref><ref>Guo, Jeff, [http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N21/gates/interview.html "In interview, Gates describes philanthropic journey"], ''The Tech'', Volume 130, Issue 21, April 23, 2010.

Gates was number one on the "[[Forbes 400]]" list from 1993 through to 2007 and number one on ''Forbes'' list of "[[Lists of billionaires|The World's Richest People]]" from 1995 to 2007 and 2009. In 1999, Gates's wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, causing the media to call him a "centibillionaire".<ref>{{harv|Fridson|2001|p=113}}</ref> Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations.

Gates began to realize the expectations others had of him when public opinion mounted that he could give more of his wealth to charity. Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]] and in 1994 sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the William H. Gates Foundation. In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations into one to create the charitable [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], which is the largest transparently operated charitable foundation in the world.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6919139|title=Flat-pack accounting |work=[[The Economist]]|date=May 11, 2006 }}</ref> The foundation is set up to allow benefactors access to how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist |publisher=BBC News|date=January 25, 2005|author=Cronin, Jon }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving |publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/ |archivedate = April 4, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] has been credited as a major influence.

The foundation has also received criticism because it invests the assets that it has not yet distributed with the exclusive goal of maximizing the [[return on investment]]. As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the Foundation is attempting to relieve poverty. These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gatesx07jan07,0,6827615.story Dark cloud over good works of Gates Foundation], Los Angeles Times, January 7, 2006.</ref>

===Recognition===
In 1987 Gates was officially declared a billionaire in the pages of Forbes' 400 Richest People in America issue, just days before his 32nd birthday. As the world's youngest self-made billionaire, he was worth $1.25 billion, over $900 million more than he'd been worth the year before, when he'd debuted on the list.<ref>http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/19/young-tech-billionaire-gates-google-yahoo-wealth.html</ref>
