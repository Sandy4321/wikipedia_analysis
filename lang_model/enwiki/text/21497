'''''Mad Dogs''''' is a British [[black comedy]] and [[psychological thriller]] [[television series]] created by Cris Cole that started broadcast on [[Sky1]] on 10 February 2011. It was produced by [[Left Bank Pictures]], and co-produced by Palma Pictures. The series stars [[John Simm]], [[Marc Warren]], [[Max Beesley]] and [[Philip Glenister]], with [[Ben Chaplin]] and Mar<U+00ED>a Botto serving as additional cast. It follows four long-time, middle-aged friends getting together in a [[villa]] in [[Majorca]] to celebrate the early retirement of Alvo, a fifth friend. However, the group find themselves caught up in the world of [[crime]] and [[police corruption]] after Alvo is murdered.

The series was initially a story about a [[rock band]], but changed after feeling bands have been "done to death." After gaining interest from some terrestrial networks, the series was commissioned by [[British Sky Broadcasting]]. Filming took place on location throughout the island of Majorca starting May 2010, and took around four million [[euro]]s and 44 days to make. The main themes are friendship and growing older; Glenister said it is about ageing and "getting closer to death." Photographer [[David LaChapelle]] directed three 30-second advertisements for the series. ''Mad Dogs'' opened with 1.61 million viewers, the 17th highest rated programme ever for Sky1, and attracted generally positive reactions from critics. They noted similarities with British gangster films, more predominantly the 2000 film ''[[Sexy Beast]]''.

==Series overview and themes==
''Mad Dogs'' centres on a reunion of four friends who have known each other since [[sixth form]], now in their 40s and a mix of single, married and divorced. They have been invited by a fifth friend, Alvo, to his villa in [[Majorca]] to celebrate his early retirement, having made his fortune in property. However, their holiday soon turns into a "labyrinthine nightmare of lies, deception and murder."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leftbankpictures.co.uk/television/mad-dogs.html |title=Mad Dogs - LEFT BANK Pictures |accessdate=6 March 2011 |work=[[Left Bank Pictures]]}}</ref>

The primary theme for the series is friendship and "growing older."<ref name=pressrelease/> Philip Glenister elaborated, saying it is not about "a group of blokes hitting their 40s and having a jolly-up. That would have been boring," but "an undercurrent of something a bit darker," and "about reaching a stage in life, looking at what you've achieved and where you go next. It's about how normal people deal with a certain situation and how they can implode." Essentially, it is about ageing and "getting closer to death."<ref name=digspy2>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a302989/glenister-refused-to-go-nude-for-mad-dogs.html |title=Glenister refused to go nude for 'Mad Dogs' |first=Christian |last=Tobin |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>

==Production==
{{Rquote|right|''Mad Dogs'' has got much more of a filmic quality to it. In a way, it doesn't feel as if we're making television.|[[Philip Glenister]] describing the style of the series.<ref name=simmguardian/>}}
The idea behind ''Mad Dogs'' came from the friendship between the four main actors, who wanted to work together for a television project, as well as Cris Cole and executive producer Suzanne Mackie.<ref name=pressrelease/> The four initially wanted to make a story about a [[rock band]], but decided that making programmes about bands have been "done to death."<ref name=beesleyintv/> To write the series, Cole was influenced by the works of [[David Lynch]] and the [[Coen brothers]] as inspiration to the kind of storytelling that is "never quite what you think it is going to be."<ref name=pressrelease/>

The series initially gained interest from major terrestrial networks such as the [[BBC]] and [[ITV]]. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more people coming in and telling you what to do. We are grown up and big enough to know where the boundaries are." They ultimately settled for [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]], as the network was "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted."<ref name=guardian2>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/03/mad-dogs-turned-down-bbc-itv?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Mad Dogs stars: we turned down BBC and ITV |first=Mark |last=Sweeney |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref> Later in January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was "vindicated," as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence and language. The actor further stated that the restrictions would not make the series "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make."<ref name=simmguardian>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/22/john-simm-interview-mad-dogs?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=John Simm interview: 'I don't really do awards' |first=Gareth |last=McLean |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref> Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary and funny it is," believing it to be "the perfect show for Sky1."<ref name=pressrelease>{{cite web |url=http://www.atvnewsnetwork.co.uk/today/index.php/atv-today/2868-mad-dogs-for-sky-one |title=Mad Dogs for Sky One |first=Dominic |last=Knight |work=AVT Today |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref> In a separate interview, Beesley stated "Andy [Harries] basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said 'Bang!

[[File:DavidLaChapelle1SecondFilm.jpg|thumb|Photographer David LaChapelle directed three 30-second advertisements for the series.]]
Three 30-second films were produced to be used as on-air promotions for the programme on all Sky channels and selected third-party channels. The promotions starred the cast, directed by [[David LaChapelle]] and shot on location in Majorca. Print, outdoor and online promotions were also made. Executive creative director Clare McDonald was impressed by LaChapelle's work because the adverts were "staying true to our vision." Television promotions were first broadcast on Sky1 on 11 January 2011.<ref name=digspy1>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a297412/lachapelle-creates-sky1-mad-dogs-promo.html |title=LaChapelle creates Sky1 'Mad Dogs' promo |first=Andrew |last=Laughlin |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> On 28 January, a preview of the first two episode were screened at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) event in [[London]].

==Release and reception==

===Broadcast and ratings===
Scheduling of the series has been changed over the course of its development. The first announcement of the series in May 2010 stated it would be broadcast during the spring 2011,<ref name=guardian1/> but by August it was announced it would be moved up to the autumn schedule,<ref name=guardian2/> before it was ultimately settled to broadcast in February 2011. The series premiere received overnight ratings of 967,000 viewers and a 4 per cent audience share. It became the second largest multichannel audience of the night, behind a repeat of ''[[EastEnders]]'' on [[BBC Three]], which was seen by 1.061 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/feb/11/tv-ratings-mad-dogs |title=Mad Dogs grabs 967,000 viewers |first=Josh |last=Halliday |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref> The consolidated ratings for the first episode raised to 1.61 million viewers, which made the episode the second largest multichannel audience in its week, behind an episode of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' on [[E4 (channel)|E4]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-30? |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes (See week Feb 07-Feb 13, 2011 and scroll down to Others) |work=BARB.co.uk |publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> It also became the 17th highest rated programme ever for Sky1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leftbankpictures.co.uk/latest-news/mad-dogs-first-episode-ranks-11th-highest-rated-programme-ever-on-sky-1.html |title=Mad Dogs' first episode ranks 17th highest rated programme ever on Sky 1 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |work=[[Left Bank Pictures]]}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Overnight ratings declined steadily to 802,000 by episode two,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a304535/celebrity-juice-bursts-past-1m.html |title='Celebrity Juice' bursts past 1m |first=Andrew |last=Laughlin |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2011 |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> and 691,000 by episode three.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s127/masterchef/news/a305856/itvs-marchlands-fends-off-masterchef.html |title=ITV's 'Marchlands' fends off 'MasterChef' |first=Andrew |last=Laughlin |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2011 |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> The first series finale went up to 938,000 viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a307153/marchlands-concludes-with-59m.html |title='Marchlands' concludes with 5.9m |first=Andrew |last=Laughlin |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> The second series premiered on [[Sky1]] on 19 January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a356877/mad-dogs-series-two-air-date-confirmed-first-trailer-unveiled.html |title='Mad Dogs' series two air date confirmed, first trailer unveiled |first=Paul |last=Millar |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Michael Deacon of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reacted positively towards the series, stating "episode one was enjoyably sinister. It was also, once or twice, quite amusing, in (of course) a blokey way." Deacon liked the beginning of the pilot where the main characters record a video message, stating "this is what Mad Dogs did well <U+2013> like any competent suspense thriller, it made you ask questions throughout. The episode bubbled with foreboding, right up to the cliffhanger." Deacon also noted at the cliffhanger that "the most disturbing sight wasn't the shower of blood but the gunman's rubber mask, which was of a grinning Tony Blair."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/michael-deacon/8317167/Philip-Glenister-in-Mad-Dogs-Sky1-review.html |title=Philip Glenister in Mad Dogs, Sky1, review |first=Michael |last=Deacon |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group}}</ref> John Crace of ''[[The Guardian]]'' however, was more mixed, starting "after unsuccessfully fobbing us off with endless series of Ross Kemp looking macho, Sky is now throwing serious money at getting viewers to watch something other than sport." Crace was critical of the set up of the episode, stating "I'm all for allowing a drama time to breathe but we didn't really need a whole hour just to establish that Alvo was a bit dodgy and that the four others had complications in their lives. Rather than building menace, the snail-like pace dissipated it," However, he reacted positively towards the end, as "things did eventually look up," adding "there's hope for Mad Dogs yet."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/11/tv-review-mad-dogs |title=TV review: Mad Dogs, 30 Rock and The Culture Show |first=John |last=Crace |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref>

Jane Simon of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' believed the "setting and the gangsterish plot are both reminiscent of that great British movie ''[[Sexy Beast]]'', and this first instalment of the four part series presses all the right buttons," adding "it has naturalistic performances, an <U+00AD>effortless blend of comedy and sinister undertones plus rather more shots of Marc Warren's bum cheeks than might be considered absolutely necessary."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/columnists/todays-tv/2011/02/10/mad-dogs-sky1-9pm-115875-22910974/ |title=Mad Dogs - Sky1, 9pm |first=Jane |last=Simon |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |work=[[Daily Mirror]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]}}</ref> Ben Walsh of ''[[The Independent]]'' rated the series three stars out of five, having written "there's far too much exposition, a very daft plot, some risible dialogue and yet Sky's ripe four-parter is horribly compelling," and added "it's extremely silly, but Simm and Glenister are always compelling and they make this gamey tale of gangsters, police corruption and 'friendship' work."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/dvd-mad-dogs-15-2231470.html |title=DVD: Mad Dogs (15) |first=Ben |last=Walsh |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited}}</ref> Reviewing the first two episode, ''[[The Stage]]'' believed the first was "a slow-burning exploration" and "all very intriguing and disturbing, with a great performance by Chaplin as the smilingly psychotic host." However, the reviewer criticised the death of Alvo, as he was considered the most "compelling character" and since "sent the plot line spinning off into less original territory," adding the producers took ideas from crime capers such as ''Sexy Beast'' and ''[[Shallow Grave]]''. However, the reviewer added "what ''Mad Dogs'' lacks in originality it makes up for in energy, verve and humour. The dialogue positively crackles with great lines." In the end, the reviewer stated that ''Mad Dogs'' "may be an unapologetic crowd pleaser, but it is a finely made one, with excellent performances from a dream cast. It also offers the only opportunity I have of seeing blue skies, azure waters and sunshine in February, so I am in for the duration."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/31334/tv-review |title=TV review: Mad Dogs, Sky 1, Thursday 10 February, 9pm |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |work=[[The Stage]] |publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited}}</ref>

Ryan Lambie of ''Den of Geek'' said of the first episode; "In terms of writing and acting, ''Mad Dogs'' is good, but not perfect, and much of its knock-about banter is uncannily like any Brit gangster flick you've ever seen," like "''Sexy Beast: the series''." However Lambie noted "when events push its premise from naff lads' drama into exotic thriller, ''Mad Dogs'' gets infinitely better, and if nothing else, it keeps you guessing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/767770/mad_dogs_episode_1_review.html |title=Mad Dogs episode 1 review |first=Ryan |last=Lambie |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |work=Den of Geek}}</ref> As the series progressed, Lambie noted that ''Mad Dogs'' was "developing into a nifty TV thriller with an engaging sense of the absurd. Writer, Cris Cole, enjoys picking holes in his characters' machismo as the tension mounts, and the strange billboard posters dotted all over the sun-scorched island, which say "Yenda a ninguna parte," ("Going nowhere") are perhaps a foreshadowing of their imminent fate."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/776367/mad_dogs_episode_2_review.html |title=Mad Dogs episode 2 review |first=Ryan |last=Lambie |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |work=Den of Geek}}</ref> However, Lambie was disappointed at the ending for being "unexpectedly flat," adding "the major plot twist that the previous three-or-so hours appeared to allude to never arrives, [...] I couldn't help but feel that, as the closing credits rolled on the whole saga, the tension and intrigue that had gradually built up in previous weeks had been allowed to slip away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/795485/mad_dogs_episode_4_review_series_finale.html |title=Mad Dogs episode 4 review: series finale |first=Ryan |last=Lambie |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |work=Den of Geek}}</ref>

|ShortSummary = The episode begins with four long-time friends Baxter (Simm), Rick (Warren), Woody (Beesley) and Quinn (Glenister) recording messages to their loved ones. A week earlier, the four arrive in Majorca, [[Spain]] to celebrate the early retirement of another friend Alvo (Chaplin), who made himself wealthy in the property business. Over the course of the first three days, Rick has a [[one-night stand]] with Lottie (Joseph), a tourist from [[Barnsley]]. Also, the group become concerned with Alvo's increasingly erratic behaviour after finding a dead goat floating in his swimming pool. When they go deep sea fishing, Alvo admits he stole the boat, and at the insistence of the others, they return to the villa. As the group argue during the evening, a man wearing a [[Tony Blair]] mask (Pozzi), nicknamed "Tiny Blair" by Rick due to his height, breaks into the villa and shoots Alvo in the head for stealing the boat.

 |ShortSummary = Immediately following Alvo's murder, the killer takes steps to frame Baxter by rubbing the gun on his face and forcing him to spit into a handkerchief, which he then pockets. Before leaving, he warns them not to go to the police, claiming to be an officer himself. The four then bury Alvo's body and spend the entire night cleaning the scene. They decide that should the police get suspicious about Alvo's disappearance, they will say he went to the mainland. Rick recalls leaving his video camera on the boat they allegedly stole, containing visual evidence of their presence (he does not know that Alvo had thrown it overboard). They proceed there to clean away all evidence of their presence when two men arrive at the boat and find bags of cocaine. Thinking the four are the owners, they are paid three million euros. They return to the villa and decide to hide the money in a rental car until they leave for England at the end of their holiday. Upon returning to the villa, police arrive, headed by detective Mar<U+00ED>a (Botto). She interviews the four individually about Alvo's behaviour. In the end, Maria discovers Quinn's camera (forgotten on a shelf) and through it witnesses the five of them talking about the boat.

 |ShortSummary = Baxter comes to realise, after another visit from Mar<U+00ED>a, that he and his friends have been caught up in activities set up by the [[Serbian mafia]]. Knowing the mafia were responsible for the murder of Jesus, the owner of the boat, who had his hands and feet removed, Rick panics, and the four get into another argument. They later decide to bring Alvo's body back to the boat, cut off his arms and feet to make it look like a mob hit. When they return to the villa, "Tiny Blair" demands to know where the boat is; Rick later disarms him. The four plan to reason with the mafia by demanding safe passage back to England in return for him. They decide to bring the tape to the police, but after realising the police may not be involved in the first place, they go to the same hotel Lottie is staying to ask her to drive the car holding the drug money to the villa for the following day. When returning to the villa, they find somebody previously broke in and executed their prisoner, leaving behind the message; "we told you not to go to the police."

 |Aux4 = 1.775
 |ShortSummary = After burying "Tiny Blair", the four see [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] firing overhead, followed by a power cut in the villa, which Woody believes are scare tactics set up by the Serbians. The next morning, Mar<U+00ED>a returns to tell them the police have found the boat, and the Serbians may be after them, and gives them one last chance for protection. Woody turns it down, not believing she is a police officer. The four get into another argument, resulting in a fight, but later reconcile. Through their video cameras and footage from the boat Rick took, Baxter realises that Alvo was involved in drug smuggling, and that Mar<U+00ED>a manipulated the four; there was no Serbian mafia, only [[police corruption|corrupt police officers]]. After they record the video messages shown in the first episode, Lottie returns with the car. The four prepare to leave the money behind while they proceed to the airport, but are stopped by Mar<U+00ED>a who intends to kill them, but Quinn kills her first. He then reveals that he will stay behind with most of the money, while the other three return to England. In the end, Quinn sees an armed Dominic (Woodward), the detective who organised the drug running, approaching the villa.

 |ShortSummary = Baxter, Rick and Woody save Quinn by running over Dominic. The four then leave the island by ferry to [[Barcelona]] to drive back to England, but accidentally board one to [[Ibiza]] instead. Quinn suffers from some shock after killing Mar<U+00ED>a. Baxter reveals he took the money with them, and believes they should start a new life with it. In order to exchange the laundered notes to legitimate ones, Rick proposes they use the money to [[gambling|gamble]]. Baxter is approached by a mysterious young woman, Carmen (Dolera), who reveals she knows they are changing money, but offers to help them; the group decides to bring her on board. She will take the money to exchange, and as collateral they look after her mother. When she discovers it is drug money, she raises her commission. Later, they are instructed to meet her colleague, Hector; they are given the money, but find the group have a new nemesis; their rental car explodes soon after.

 |ShortSummary = The men hide from a man in a motorcycle, who returns to the car to ensure they are dead. When the ruse initially succeeds, the four proceed to a nearby abandoned village to stay the night, however Rick wishes to split from the group after they are done. En route they are chased and taunted by the man in the bike. By the time they arrive at the village, they hide the money in a hollowed [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] statue in the church. The next morning a local elderly woman who practices [[santer<U+00ED>a]] "protects" them by lining goat's blood around the village. Baxter and Carmen, who joined them while searching for Hector, connect and have sex, while Woody and Rick argue at the bar. Quinn has a crisis of faith, and ultimately crosses the line of goat blood, and as a consequence he is captured by Mackenzie (Warner), who reveals the money is his, and wants it returned within 24 hours or they will die. When he brings Quinn back to relay the message, they discover they are <U+20AC>114,000 short. As they plan to raise the money, they find Hector dead.

 |ShortSummary = Two weeks previously, it is revealed that Alvo wished to stop working for Mackenzie, but he, Dominic and Mar<U+00ED>a pressure him to do another job. In the present, the group decide to [[wire transfer]] their savings and Hector's commission to raise the money, but they are still <U+20AC>54,000 short. Carmen suggests they break into a safe in the [[nightclub]] where she works. After they agree however, Woody recalls Alvo left <U+20AC>50,000 in his safe (they took the safe because their [[mobile phone]]s are inside, and they were never given the combination before he was murdered). They manage to break into the safe and Quinn sells his watch. Woody and Baxter also steal from two [[living statue]]s. After recovering the hidden money from the church (as a [[wedding]] takes place), they journey to the rendezvous, but are pulled over by police and have to pay a fine. They meet with Mackenzie and admit the money is down <U+20AC>100 because of the fine.

 |ShortSummary = Mackenzie decides to assign the group a task and then they are free to go home. However, he forces Quinn to stay with him in his [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Mackenzie admits that although he is rich enough, he cannot let the three million euros go because of his reputation. The rest are instructed to pick up supplies to produce [[MDMA|ecstasy]] from a cabana and send them to the abandoned village. En route Baxter returns for Carmen. After making the ecstasy, Carmen exits the van to wait for Baxter later. They deliver the ecstasy in a nightclub. After they receive five million euros as payment, they drive back to Mackenzie's caravan in time to save Quinn. It is revealed that Mackenzie made them produce fake tablets to fool the nightclub owners. Mackenzie lets them go, instructing them to board a cargo container, which will take them back to the mainland via ferry. As an extra, he allows them to keep the money. Baxter is forced to leave Carmen behind, though he intends to contact her when they arrive in Barcelona. However, later they find that Mackenzie tricked them; the ferry arrives in [[Morocco]] and the money is confiscated by armed men.
