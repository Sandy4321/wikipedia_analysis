The '''Mus<U+00E9>e arch<U+00E9>ologique''' of [[Strasbourg]], [[France]] is the largest of the numerous [[Alsace|Alsacian]] museums displaying regional [[archeology|archeological]] findings from Prehistory to the [[Merovingian dynasty]].It is located in the basement of the [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg|Palais Rohan]].

Th museum goes back to the legacy of the historian Jean-Daniel Schoepflin (or Johann Daniel Sch<U+00F6>pflin) (1694-1771) , who bequeathed his collection to the city of Strasbourg. The ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> pour la conservation des monuments historiques d<U+2019>Alsace'' (Society for the Conservation of the Historical Monuments of Alsace), founded in 1855, expanded and publicly displayed the municipal collections, of which a large jumbre was however destroyed in 1870, during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. During the reconstruction of the cuity and its museums, the ''mus<U+00E9>e arch<U+00E9>ologique'' moved to the premises that are still currently its own. In the 20th century longtime directors Robert Forrer and Jean-Jacques Hatt worked on the systematic study of the Alsacian ground and the substantial enlargement of the collection. Betwen 1988 and 1992, the ''mus<U+00E9>e'' was thoroughly renovated. Its collections continue to grow steadily due to the numerous excavations made in and around Strasbourg since the beginning of the construction of the new [[Tramways in Strasbourg|Tramway network]].

The museum presents an overview of the [[Human habitat]] in the region beginning with the earliest traces of Human dwelling and settling. A special focus is put on [[Argentoratum]] and its outposts along the [[Rhine]] like Seltz (Saliso). The museum also displays findings from the Gallo-Roman sanctuaries on the [[Mont Donon]] and in [[Mackwiller]], as well as Merovingian findings made around [[Erstein]].
