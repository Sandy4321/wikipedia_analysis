'''James Stephen Ewing''' (December 25, 1866, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] <U+2014> May 16, 1943, [[New York City]]) was an [[USA|American]] [[Pathology|pathologist]]. He was the first Professor of [[pathology]] at [[Cornell University]] and became famous with the discovery of a form of malignant [[bone]] [[tumor]] that later became known as [[Ewing's sarcoma]].

==Life==
James Ewing, was born in 1866 to a prominent family of Pittsburgh. He first completed his M.A. in 1888 [[New International Encyclopedia]] at [[Amherst College]] and then studied [[medicine]] at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York]], from 1888 to 1891. While a student, he was tutored by [[Francis Delafield]] (1841-1915), [[Theophil Mitchell Prudden]] (1849-1924) and [[Alexander Kolisko]] (1857-1918), and developed a strong interest in pathology. He returned to the College of Physicians and Surgeons as instructor in [[histology]] (1893-1897), and clinical pathology (1897-1898). After a brief stint as a surgeon with the US Army, Ewing was appointed in 1899 the first professor of clinical pathology at the Medical College of [[Cornell University]] in New York. His research activities on experimental [[cancer]] were mostly pursued at the [[Loomis Laboratory for Research in Experimental Pathology]], together with the [[New York Memorial Hospital]]. In 1902, Dr. Ewing helped to establish one of the first funds for cancer research, endowed by P. Huntington. With his discoveries, Ewing became the most important experimental [[oncology|oncologist]] and helped to found, in 1907, the [[American Association for Cancer Research]], and in 1913, the American Society for the Control of Cancer, now the [[American Cancer Society]]. In 1931 Ewing was elected to the presidency of the Medical Board of the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases, and became also its director or research. He was also responsible for the creation of present-day [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] in New York City, one of the most important multidisciplinary centers devoted to oncology in the world. He worked at the Memorial until his retirement, in 1939.  In 1908 he was president of the [[Harvey Society]].  

James Ewing died from [[bladder cancer]] at the age of 76.

==Works==
Ewing was active in many fronts, including [[hematology]] as well as oncology. A scientific breakthrough came in 1906, when Ewing and his collaborators proved for the first time that a cancer ([[lymphosarcoma]] in dogs) could be transmitted from one animal to another. In 1920 he published his first work on a new kind of malignant [[osteoma]] (cancer of the [[bone]]), which later received his name. Ewing became known also as one of the first proponents of [[radiation therapy]] for cancer, having founded the [[National Radium Institute]] in 1913, together with [[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]], a mining engineer. This knowledge became a cornerstone of cancer treatment at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]].
In 1928 he challenged the 'seed vs soil' hypothesis of metastatic tumor dissemination, originally credited to [[Stephen Paget]] and proposed that [[metastasis]] occurs purely by anatomic and mechanical routes.
