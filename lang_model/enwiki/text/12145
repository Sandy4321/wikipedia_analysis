'''M<U+0160>K <U+017D>ilina''' is a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club, playing in the town of [[Zilina|<U+017D>ilina]].

==History==
The club was founded towards the end of [[1908]] under the Hungarian name ''Zsolnai testgyakorl<U+00F3>k k<U+00F6>re''. Between the two world wars, when for a brief time Slovakia became an independent nation, the club won Slovakian championship twice, in 1928 and 1929. The club played 31 seasons in the First Division of the Czechoslovakian League.

In 1961 <U+017D>ilina reached the final of the nationalcup, where they lost to [[Dukla Prague]], the eventual Czechoslovakian champion. In spite of the defeat <U+017D>ilina gained entry into Europe for the first time and competed in the Cup winners' cup. In their first venture into European, <U+017D>ilina made the quarter-final, but were defeated by [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. At home <U+017D>ilina won 3-2, but in [[Italy]], Fiorentina proved to be too strong and won the game 2-0. In 1969.

In 1996 <U+017D>ilina was promoted from the second division after spending just a season there. In 1997, the club gained entry to the [[Intertoto Cup]], but only came fourth in a group of five. Again they entered the Intertoto Cup in 1999 but just as last time failed to make any impression, being beaten 4-2 by [[FC Metz]] in the second round.

In the autumn of 2000, coach [[Ladislav Jurkemik]] joined the club only to depart halfway through the 2001/02 season to become coach of the Slovak national team. Nevertheless the team continued with its winning mentality and became national champions with the help of new coach, [[Leo<U+0161> Kalvoda]].

In 2002/03 the season, now under the management of Milan Le<U+0161>ick<U+00FD>, the club succeeded in retaining its national championship. The following season began in a disappointing way and coach Le<U+0161>ick<U+00FD> with Ladislav Jurkemik, for his second spell in charge. He led the club to 10 successive victories and just clinched the title due to goal difference.

One of the club's most notable players of the modern time is [[Marek Mint<U+00E1>l]], in two successive seasons he was the top goal scorer in the league with 21 and 20 goals respectively, and was a major contributor to <U+017D>ilina winning their three Slovakian titles and earning himself a move to [[1. FC N<U+00FC>rnberg|FC N<U+00FC>rnberg]] of [[Germany]].
