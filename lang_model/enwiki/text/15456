'''J<U+00E1>nos Kis''' (born [[September 17]], [[1943]]) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[philosopher]] and [[political scientist]].

Kis was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary. He graduated from [[Philosophy]] at the [[E<U+00F6>tv<U+00F6>s Lor<U+00E1>nd University]] in [[1967]].  In [[1973]] he was dismissed as a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] after co-authoring a book criticizing [[Marxist]] socialism.  Strongly opposed to the [[communist regime]] in Hungary, he helped to create the first opposition journal ''Besz<U+00E9>l<U+0151>'' which was first issued in December [[1981]]. He was the Editor-in-Chief of this underground journal until the democratization of the country in [[1989]].  He was also member of the [[democratic]] opposition party [[Alliance of Free Democrats ]](SzDSz). 

From 1988 to 1989 he was visiting professor at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]]. 

After the fall of communism in [[1989]]-[[1990]], the SzDSz entered the democratic government and Kis was elected as the party leader in February 23, 1990. He remained in this office until November 23, [[1991]], when he left active politics and returned to an academic career. In [[1992]], he became a professor at the [[Central European University]]. From 1996, he is also visiting professor at the [[New York University]].

Kis has written numerous articles and books on political science, such as ''Politics as a Moral Problem''. Despite having left the political arena years ago, he continues to take positions on controversial issues such as the war in [[Iraq]], voicing his [[liberal]] and democratic points of view.
