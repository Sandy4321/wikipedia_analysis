==Biography==
===Early years===

Joseph Freeman was born October 7, 1897 in the village of [[Piratin]], part of the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava district]] in the [[Ukraine]], which was then part of the [[Russian empire]]. Freeman's parents, Stella and Isaac Freeman, were of ethnic [[Jewish]] extraction, forced to live in the [[Pale of Settlement]] by the [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] laws of the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] regime. At the behest of his grandfather, Freeman spoke [[Yiddish (language)]] as a small boy. His parents worked as shopkeepers.<ref>Joseph Freeman, ''An American Testament: A Narrative of Rebels and Romantics.'' New York: Octagon Books, 1973; pp. 4-5.</ref>

In his memoirs, Freeman recalled a traumatic boyhood incident which had followed shortly after a [[pogrom]] of the Jewish population of a neighboring town:

<blockquote>
"Less than a week later a bearded [[peasant]] came into my mother's store drunk. He asked for tobacco in a voice that frightened me, and my mother handed him a package.<br /><br />
'I'm not going to pay you,' he said. 'You filthy Jews get too much money.'<br /><br />
'Then you can't have the tobacco.'<br /><br />
The peasant took a clasp knife from his pocket. He opened the long blade and brandished it at my mother.<br /><br />
'I'll kill you,' he growled.  Then he walked over to me and brandished the knife over my head. 'We'll have a nice little pogrom. We'll kill all the goddam Jews in this goddam town.'<br /><br />
I was terrified and clung to my mother's skirt. She held me tightly to her and I saw the tears run down her cheeks. The door creaked. I saw it open. Our clerk came in. He seized the drunk by the collar and threw him into the street. The man rolled head down into the sewer-ditch. A policeman came runing, dragged the peasant to his feet and lugged him into a carriage.... I felt sorry for the peasant, and felt guilty because I felt sorry."<ref>Freeman, ''An American Testament,'' pp. 5-6.</ref></blockquote>

Along with hundreds of thousands of others fleeing ethnic violence in Russia, the Freemans emigrated to the [[United States of America|United States]] in 1904. Joseph was naturalized as a US citizen in 1920.<ref name="Gannon">Francis X. Gannon, ''A Biographical Dictionary of The Left: Volume 4.'' Boston: Western Islands, 1973; pp. 376-378.</ref> In the new world, the Freemans managed to gain a middle class existence living in  [[Brooklyn, New York]], with Isaac Freeman earning a living in America as a [[real estate]] dealer.<ref name="ALWW">Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), ''The American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 79.</ref>

Freeman joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1914, when he was 17 years old.<ref name="Gannon" /> He worked as a telegraph clerk, a waiter, and a retail clerk during his college years.<ref name="ALWW" />

Freeman attended [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1919.<ref name="Gannon" />

===Career===

Following graduation from Columbia, Freeman went to work on the editorial staff of a book project initiated by ''[[Harper's magazine]]'' entitled ''Illustrated History of the World War.''<ref name="Gannon" /> He also worked on the editorial staff of ''[[Women's Wear Daily|Women's Wear]]'' in 1919 and 1920.<ref name="ALWW" />

Freeman went abroad in 1920 to take a position on the staff of the [[Paris]] edition of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]],'' later moving to [[London]] to work for the paper from that location.<ref name="ALWW" />

In 1922 Freeman returned to New York City, where he shortly took a position on the staff of ''Garment News,'' the New York-based publication of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union]].<ref name="ALWW" /> He became a member of editorial staff of the left wing artistic magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'' in 1922 and became Associate Editor of that publication in 1923.<ref name="ALWW" />

Freeman became a member of the [[Workers Party of America]], forerunner of the [[Communist Party USA]] during this interval.<ref>Alan Wald, ''The New York Intellectuals: The Rise and Decline of the Anti-Stalinist Left from the 1930s to the 1980s.'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1987; pg. 51.</ref> He was subsequently active in various [[mass organization|mass organizations]] of the party, including the [[American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born]] and the [[All-America Anti-Imperialist League]].<ref name="Gannon" />

In 1924, Freeman became the publicity director of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU).

Freeman was a founding editor of the magazine ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1934, a publication which touted itself as "A Bi-Monthly of Revolutionary Literature Published by the [[John Reed Clubs|John Reed Club]] of New York." The magazine was launched with the understanding that it would concentrate primarily on literary and cultural themes, thereby leaving ''The New Masses'' to pursue a heavier portion of political themes.<ref>Wald, ''The New York Intellectuals,'' pg. 78.</ref>

In 1936, Freeman published his memoirs, ''An American Testament: A Narrative of Rebels and Romantics.'' He left the Communist movement at about that time, working as a [[freelance writer]] for such publications as ''[[The Nation]],'' ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]].''<ref name="Gannon" />

In 1940, Freeman returned to the ACLU for a second stint as its publicity director, working in that capacity until 1942. He then moved into [[radio]], working on the editorial staff of a news program called "Information Please."<ref name="Gannon" />

From 1948 until 1961, Freeman worked in the private sector in the field of [[public relations]], employed by the firms of [[Edward L. Bernays]] and Executive Research, Inc.<ref name="Gannon" />
