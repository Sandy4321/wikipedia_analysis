'''Operation Deep Water''' was a 1957 [[NATO]] naval exercise held in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that also involved the first units of the [[United States Marines Corps]] to participated in a [[Air assault|helicopter-borne vertical envelopment operation]] during an overseas deployment.  Operation Deep Water and the other concurrent NATO exercises held during the fall of 1957 would be the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.<ref name="Chapter 9"/<ref>{{cite book | last=Key Jr. | first=David M. | year=2001 | month= | title=Admiral Jerauld Wright:  Warrior among Diplomats | publisher=Sunflower University Press | location=Manhattan, Kansas | isbn=0-89745-25-8 | pages=333 }}</ref><ref name=EmergencyCall>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891351,00.html |title=Emergency Call |accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] |date= 30 September 1957 }}</ref>
==Background==
Faced with the overwhelming numerical superiority of [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] military forces, NATO embraced the concept of the [[nuclear umbrella]] to protect [[Western Europe]] from a Soviet ground invasion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/3.htm |title=Chapter 3 |accessdate=2008-11-03 |work=NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/7.htm |title=Chapter 7 |accessdate=2008-11-03 |work=NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |date= }}</ref><ref name="Chapter 9">{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/9.htm |title=Chapter 9 |accessdate=2008-11-03 |work=NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/annexes/b5.htm |title=Chapter IX-B |accessdate=2008-11-03 |work=NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |date= }}</ref>  This strategy was articulated in January 1954 by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] and then-[[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] [[Alfred Gruenther]]: 
{{Quote|We have... an air-ground shield which, although still not strong enough, would force an enemy to concentrate prior to attack. In doing so, the concentrating force would be extremely vulnerable to losses from atomic weapon attacks...  We can now use atomic weapons against an aggressor, delivered not only by long-range aircraft, but also by the use of shorter range planes, and by 280 mm. artillery...  This air-ground team constitutes a very effective shield, and it would fight very well in case of attack.<ref name="Chapter 9"/>}}

This strategic concept reflected the American strategy of [[massive retaliation]] of the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] as set forth by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]]:

{{Quote|We need allies and [[collective security]]. Our purpose is to make these relations more effective, less costly. This can be done by placing more reliance on deterrent power and less dependence on local defensive power...  Local defense will always be important.  But there is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty landpower of the Communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power. A potential aggressor must know that he cannot always prescribe battle conditions that suit him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/article-dulles-retaliation_1962-01-25.htm |title=The Evolution of Foreign Policy |accessdate=2008-09-04 |author= John Foster Dulles |authorlink=John Foster Dulles |date=12 January 1954  |publisher=Department of State, Press Release No. 81 |archiveurl= http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/article-dulles-retaliation_1954-01-12.htm |archivedate= 1998 - 2011 Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |quote= }}</ref>}}

==SHAPE & AFSOUTH command structure==

On 2 April 1951, [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) was stood up as the first of the NATO<U+2019>s two principal military field commanders, with [[SACLANT|Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT)]] being established on 30 January 1952.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/7.htm |title=Chapter 7 - The Military Structure - Allied Command Europe |accessdate=2011-06-17 |work=NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |date= }}</ref>  Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) was one of two major NATO commands in the Mediterranean area, the other being Allied Forces Mediterranean based on the island of Malta, responsible for naval activities in the region. While [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Robert B. Carney]] of the [[U.S. Navy]] was appointed as Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CinCAFSOUTH) on 19 June 1951,<ref>{{cite web | title= JFC Naples/AFSOUTH, 1951-2009: Over Fifty Years Working for Peace and Stability | url= http://www.afsouth.nato.int/JFCN_Factsheets/JFC_Naples_history.html | work= Fact Sheets | publisher= [[Allied Joint Force Command Naples]] | date= 2009  | accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>  AFMED was not activated until 1953. The delay was due to negotiations and compromises between the Americans and the British, who wished to retain one of their commanders over Britain's traditional [[sea lines of communication]] stretching through the Mediterranean to the Suez Canal and beyond.

==Operational history==
Operation Deep Water involved protecting the [[Dardanelles]] from a simulated Soviet invasion. This operation was under the command of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] Charles R. Brown, [[United States Navy]], NATO's Commander Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (COMSTRIKFORSOUTH).<ref name=EmergencyCall/><ref name=AllAshore>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809962,00.html |title=All Ashore |accessdate=2008-11-07 |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] |date=1957-10-07 }}</ref>  During the operation, the amphibious task forces was repeatedly over-flown by an unidentified [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]]-based twin-engine bomber over a three-day period, prompting Admiral Brown to order two [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]] jet fighters to intercept this intruder.<ref>{{cite web | title= From All Quarters: Uninvited Observer | url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%201440.html | publisher= ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'' | date= October 4, 1957 | accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref>

On 29 September 1957, the exercise culminated in the [[Amphibious warfare|landing]] of 8,000 U.S. Marines at [[Saros Gulf]] near [[Gallipoli]], [[Turkey]], from a 38-ship amphibious task force, with air support provided by aircraft carriers from the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]] .  Operation Deep Water saw the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, become the first unit of the [[United States Marines Corps]] to participated in a [[Air assault|helicopter-borne vertical envelopment operation]] during an overseas deployment.  It was also the first time that a U.S. Marine [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force|joint air-sea-ground task force]] had been used in NATO exercise.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jones | first=William K. | coauthors= | year=1987 | month= | title=A Brief History of the 6th Marines | publisher=USMC Headquarters - Historical Division | location=Washington, DC | isbn=1900031000 (PCN) | pages=130 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first= Ralph W. |coauthors= Gabrielle M.

In addition to Operation Deep Water, NATO also conducted two other major military exercises in September 1957.  [[Operation Strikeback]] was a series of multilateral naval exercises that concentrated on NATO's eastern Atlantic/northern European flank.  [[Operation Counter Punch]] involved NATO's central flank on the European mainland.<ref name=EmergencyCall/><ref name=AllAshore/>
