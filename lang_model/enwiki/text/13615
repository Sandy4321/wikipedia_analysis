{{Freedom}}
{{Censorship}}

'''[[Freedom of speech]]''' is the concept of the inherent [[human rights|human right]] to voice one's opinion [[in public|publicly]] without fear of [[censorship]] or [[punishment]]. "Speech" is not limited to public speaking and is generally taken to include other forms of expression. The right is preserved in the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and is granted formal recognition by the laws of most nations. Nonetheless the degree to which the right is upheld in practice varies greatly from one nation to another. In many nations, particularly those with relatively [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] forms of government, overt government censorship is enforced. Censorship has also been claimed to occur in other forms (see [[propaganda model]]) and there are different approaches to issues such as [[hate speech]], [[obscenity]], and [[defamation]] laws even in countries seen as [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]].

==International law==
{{Wikisource|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
{{Main|Freedom of speech (international)}}
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, provides, in Article 19, that:
<blockquote>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/RES/217(III)&Lang=E|format=pdf|language=English/French|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=General Assembly of the United Nations|pages=4<U+2013>5|accessdate=2007-05-06|date=1948-12-10}}</ref></blockquote>

Technically, as a resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] rather than a treaty, it is not legally binding in its entirety on members of the UN. Furthermore, whilst some of its provisions are considered to form part of [[customary international law]], there is dispute as to which. Freedom of speech is granted unambiguous protection in international law by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] which is binding on around 150 nations.

In adopting the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Australia and the Netherlands insisted on reservations to Article 19 insofar as it might be held to affect their systems of regulating and licensing broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4_1.htm|title=List of Declarations and Reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|author=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2007-05-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070122093223/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4_1.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-22}}</ref>

==African continent==
[[File:VigilZimbabweEmbassyLondon20050604 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters use freedom of speech to hold a vigil in front of the Zimbabwean Embassy in London, 2005.]]
The majority of African constitutions provide legal protection for freedom of speech. However, these rights are exercised inconsistently in practice. The replacement of authoritarian regimes in Kenya and Ghana has substantially improved the situation in those countries. On the other hand, Eritrea allows no independent media and uses draft evasion as a pretext to crack down on any dissent, spoken or otherwise. One of the poorest and smallest nations in Africa, Eritrea is now the largest prison for journalists; since 2001, fourteen journalists have been imprisoned in unknown places without a trial. Sudan, Libya, and Equatorial Guinea also have repressive laws and practices. In addition, many state radio stations (which are the primary source of news for illiterate people) are under tight control and programs, especially talk shows providing a forum to complain about the government, are often censored.
Also countries like Somalia and Egypt provide legal protection for freedom of speech but it is not used publicly.

===South Africa===
South Africa is probably the most liberal in granting freedom of speech, however in light of South Africa's racial and discriminatory history, particularly the [[Apartheid]] era, the [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]] of 1996 precludes expression that is tantamount to the advocacy of hatred based on some listed grounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahrc.org.za/sahrc_cms/downloads/Freedom%20of%20Expression.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2007-05-06|title=Freedom of Expression|date=pre-1997 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614102820/http://www.sahrc.org.za/sahrc_cms/downloads/Freedom+of+Expression.doc <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> Freedom of speech and expression are both protected and limited by a section in the [[South African Bill of Rights]], chapter 2 of the Constitution. Section 16 makes the following provisions:
:<U+00A7> 16 Freedom of expression
::(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes-
:::(a) freedom of the press and other media;
:::(b) freedom to receive or impart information or ideas;
:::(c) freedom of artistic creativity; and
:::(d) academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.
::(2) The right in subsection (1) does not extend to-
:::(a) propaganda for war;
:::(b) incitement of imminent violence; or
:::(c) advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.

In 2005, the [[South African Constitutional Court]] set an international precedent in the case of ''[[Laugh It Off Promotions CC v South African Breweries International]]'' when it found that the small [[culture jamming]] company Laugh-it-Off's right to freedom of expression outweighs the protection of trademark of the world's second largest brewery.<ref>''Laugh It Off Promotions CC v South African Breweries International (Finance) BV t/a SabMark International (Freedom of Expression Institute as Amicus Curiae)'' 2006 (1) SA 144 (CC) http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/7.html</ref>

=== Sudan ===
[[Blasphemy]] against religion is illegal in Sudan under [[Blasphemy laws]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Terri Judy|title=Teacher held for teddy bear 'blasphemy'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/teacher-held-for-teddy-bear-blasphemy-760590.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=2007-11-27}}</ref>

==Australia==
{{See also|Censorship in Australia}}
Australia does not have explicit freedom of speech in any constitutional or statutory declaration of rights, with the exception of political speech which is protected from criminal prosecution at [[common law]] per ''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]]''.

In 1992 the [[High Court of Australia]] judged in the case of ''Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth'' that the [[Australian Constitution]], by providing for a system of representative and responsible government, implied the protection of political communication as an essential element of that system. This freedom of political communication is not a broad freedom of speech as in other countries, but rather a freedom whose purpose is only to protect political free speech. This freedom of political free speech is a shield against government prosecution, not a shield against private prosecution ([[civil law (common law)|civil law]]). It is also less a causal mechanism in itself, rather than simply a boundary which can be adjudged to be breached. Despite the court's ruling, however, not all political speech appears to be protected in Australia and several laws criminalise forms of speech that would be protected in other democratic countries such as the United States. 

In 1996, [[Albert Langer]] was imprisoned for advocating that voters fill out their ballot papers in a way that was invalid.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/events/election_04/albertlanger.htm | title = The story of Albert Langer | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | author = Triple J | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 2004-06-30 }}</ref> [[Amnesty International]] declared Langer to be a [[prisoner of conscience]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA120051996 | title = Australia: Political activist becomes first prisoner of conscience for over 20 years (Albert Langer) <U+2013> Amnesty International | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | author = Amnesty International | date = 1996-02-23 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The section which outlawed Langer from encouraging people to vote this way has since been repealed and the law now says only that it is an offence to print or publish material which may deceive or mislead a voter.

The [[Howard Government]] re-introduced [[Australian sedition law|sedition law]], which criminalises some forms of expression. ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' ran a series on the amendments on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC television]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1489465.htm | title = Seditious opinion?

In 2006, [[CSIRO]] senior scientist [[Graeme Pearman]] was reprimanded and encouraged to resign after he spoke out on [[climate change|global warming]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/scientists-bitter-over-interference/2006/02/12/1139679479548.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Jo | last=Chandler | title=Scientists bitter over interference | date=2006-02-13}}</ref> The Howard Government was accused of limiting the speech of Pearman and other scientists.

==Asia==
Several Asian countries provide formal legal guarantees of freedom of speech to their citizens. These are not, however, implemented in practice in some countries. Countries such as Myanmar, North Korea and some Central Asian Republics are reported to brutally repress freedom of speech.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Freedom of speech has improved somewhat in the People's Republic of China in recent years,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but the level of free expression is still far from that of Western nations. There is no clear correlation between legal and constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and actual practices among Asian nations.

{{See also|Censorship in India}}
The [[Indian Constitution]] guarantees freedom of speech to every citizen and there have been landmark cases in the [[Indian Supreme Court]] that have affirmed the nation's policy of allowing free press and freedom of expression to every citizen. In India, citizens are free to criticize politics, politicians, bureaucracy and policies. The freedoms are comparable to those in the United States and Western European democracies. Article 19 of the [[Constitution of India|Indian constitution]] states that:

<blockquote>All citizens shall have the right <U+2014>
#to freedom of speech and expression;
#to assemble peaceably and without arms;
#to form associations or unions;

Freedom of speech is restricted by the [[National Security Act (India)|National Security Act of 1980]] and in the past, by the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO) of 2001, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) from 1985 to 1995, and similar measures. Freedom of speech is also restricted by Section 124A of the [[Indian Penal Code|Indian Penal Code, 1860]] which deals with [[sedition]] and makes any speech or expression which brings contempt towards government punishable by imprisonment extending from three years to life.<ref>[http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S124A.htm "Section 124A - Sedition"], Indian Penal Code, 1860, VakilNo1.com</ref> In 1962 the Supreme Court of India held this section to be constitutionally valid in the case ''Kedar Nath Singh vs State of Bihar''.<ref>[http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/111867/ ''Kedar Nath Singh vs State Of Bihar on 20 January, 1962''], 1962 AIR 955, 1962 SCR Supl.

===Japan===
Freedom of speech is guaranteed by article 29 of the Japanese constitution. There are few exemptions to this right and a very broad spectrum of opinion is tolerated by the media and authorities.

===Malaysia===
{{See also|Censorship in Malaysia}}
In Malaysia, "God" and "[[Prophet Muhammad]]" are used by politicians to answer to the peoples and the media. In May 2008, the Prime Minister of Malaysia Datuk Seri [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] put forward a headline "Media should practice voluntary self-censorship",<ref>[http://thestaronline.tv/default.aspx?vid=1417 Thestaronline.tv]</ref> saying there is no such thing as unlimited freedom and the media should not be abashed of "voluntary self-censorship" to respect cultural norms, different societies hold different values and while it might be acceptable in secular countries to depict a caricature of Prophet Muhammad, it was clearly not the case here. "It is not a moral or media sin to respect prophets. He said the Government also wanted the media not to undermine racial and religious harmony to the extent that it could threaten national security and public order. "I do not see these laws as curbs on freedom. Rather, they are essential for a healthy society."<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/5/27/nation/20080527164857&sec=nation Thestar.com.my]</ref>

Articles 19 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] guarantees freedom of speech and expression, and freedom of the press with certain restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html|title=The Constitution of Pakistan|publisher=pakistani.org}}</ref> Blasphemy against Islam is illegal in Pakistan.<ref name="Pak2009">{{cite web | title = Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom May 2009 | work = Pakistan | publisher = [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] | date = May 2009 | url = http://www.uscirf.gov/images/AR2009/pakistan.pdf | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}</ref>

===People's Republic of China (mainland)===
{{See also|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}

Article 35 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] claims that:

<blockquote>Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |title=Chapter II. The Fundamental Rights and duties of Citizens |work=Constitution of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=2007-05-12 |date=1982-12-04}}</ref></blockquote>

Nonetheless strict censorship is widespread in mainland China. There is heavy government involvement in the media, with many of the largest media organizations being run by the Communist government. References to [[democracy]], the free Tibet movement, [[Taiwan]] as an independent country, the [[Tiananmen Square Massacre]], the [[Arab Spring]], certain religious organizations and anything questioning the legitimacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] are banned from use in public and blocked on the [[Internet]].
Web portals including [[Microsoft]]'s [[MSN]] have come under criticism for aiding in these practices, including banning the word "democracy" from its chat-rooms in China.

Due to close geographical proximity to Hong Kong, parts of southern China are able to receive broadcast signals from television channels in Hong Kong, where [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|China's censorship]] does not apply.
However, comments that the Communist Party feel uncomfortable with are cut out and replaced with TV commercials before they can reach consumers TVs in mainland China. Very few Western films are given permission to play in Chinese theatres, although widespread [[Intellectual property infringement in the People's Republic of China|unlicensed copying]] of these films makes them widely available.

=== Philippines ===

Article III Section 4 of the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] specifies that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of expression. Some laws inconsistent with a broad application of this mandate are in force, however.{{#tag:Ref|For example
*Certain sections of the Flag and Heraldic Code require particular expressions and prohibit other expressions<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071205235342/http://www.gov.ph/aboutphil/RA8491.asp Republic Act No. 8491], approved February 12, 1998, Government of the Republic of the Philippines.</ref>
*Title thirteen of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]] criminalizes libel and slander by act or deed (slander by deed is defined as "any act ... which shall cast dishonor, discredit or contempt upon another person."), providing penalties of fine or imprisonment. In 2012, acting on a complaint by an imprisoned broadcaster who dramatised a newspaper account reporting that a particular politician was seen running naked in a hotel when caught in bed by the husband of the woman with whom he was said to have spent the night, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that the criminalization of libel violates [[freedom of expression]] and is inconsistent with Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], commenting that "Defamations laws should not ... stifle freedom of expression" and that "Penal defamation laws should include defense of truth."<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/16100-libel-law-violates-freedom-of-expression--un-rights-panel Libel law violates freedom of expression <U+2013> UN rights panel], The Manila Times, January 30, 2012.</ref>}}

===South Korea===
The South Korean constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, petition and assembly. However, behaviors or speeches in favor of the North Korean regime or communism can be punished by the [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Law]], though in recent years prosecutions under this law have been rare.

There is a strict election law that takes effect a few months before elections which prohibits most speech that either supports or criticizes a particular candidate or party. One can be prosecuted for political parodies and even for wearing a particular color (usually the color of a party).<ref>[http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffreeinternet.or.kr%2Fmaybbs%2Fshowview.php%3Fdb%3Dfreeinternet%26code%3Ddecla%26n%3D32%26page%3D&hl=ko&ie=UTF8&sl=ko&tl=en Google.com]</ref>

{{See also |Censorship in Thailand |Internet censorship in Thailand}}

While the [[Constitution of Thailand|Thai constitution]] provides for freedom of expression, by law the government may restrict freedom of expression to preserve national security, maintain public order, preserve the rights of others, protect public morals, and prevent insults to Buddhism. The [[lese-majeste]] law makes it a crime, punishable by up to 15 years' imprisonment for each offense, to criticize, insult, or threaten the king, queen, royal heir apparent, or regent. Defamation is a criminal offense and parties that criticize the government or related businesses may be sued, setting the stage for self censorship.<ref name=ThaiHRR>[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dlid=186310 "Thailand"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State</ref> 

Censorship expanded considerably starting in 2003 during the [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] administration and after the [[2006 Thai coup d'<U+00E9>tat|2006 military coup]]. Prosecutions for lese-majeste offenses increased significantly starting in 2006. Journalists are generally free to comment on government activities and institutions without fear of official reprisal, but they occasionally practice self-censorship, particularly with regard to the monarchy and national security. Broadcast media are subject to government censorship, both directly and indirectly, and self-censorship is evident. Under the Emergency Decree in the three southernmost provinces, the government may restrict print and broadcast media, online news, and social media networks there.<ref name=ThaiHRR/>

{{Wikisource|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms}}
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), signed on 4 November 1950, guarantees a broad range of human rights to inhabitants of member countries of the [[Council of Europe]], which includes almost all European nations. These rights include Article 10, which entitles all citizens to free expression. Echoing the language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this provides that:

:Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.

The Convention established the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR). Any person who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court. Judgements finding violations are binding on the States concerned and they are obliged to execute them. The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] monitors the execution of judgements, particularly to ensure payment of the amounts awarded by the Court to the applicants in compensation for the damage they have sustained.

The Convention also includes some other restrictions:

:The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or the rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

For example, the Council of Europe ''Explanatory Report'' of the [[Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime]] states the "European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that the denial or revision of 'clearly established [[Fact#Fact in history|historical fact]]s <U+2013> such as the [[Holocaust]] <U+2013> [...] would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17' of the ECHR" in the ''[[Lehideux and Isorni v. France]]'' judgment of 23 September 1998.<ref name="conventions.coe.int">[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Reports/Html/189.htm Explanatory Report on the additional protocol to the convention on cybercrime]</ref>

Each party to the Convention must alter its laws and policies to conform with the Convention, some, such as the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, have expressly incorporated the Convention into their domestic laws. The guardian of the Convention is the European Court of Human Rights. This court has heard many cases relating to freedom of speech, including cases that have tested the professional obligations of confidentiality of journalists and lawyers, and the application of defamation law, a recent example being the so called "[[McLibel case]]".

{{Wikisource|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
Currently, all members of the [[European Union]] are signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights in addition to having various constitutional and legal rights to freedom of expression at the national level. The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] has been legally binding since December 1, 2009 when the Treaty of Lisbon became fully ratified and effective. Article 11 of the Charter, in part mirroring the language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, provides that

:1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.
:2. The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.

The [[European Court of Justice]] takes into account both the Charter and the Convention when making its rulings.  According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union accedes to the European Convention as an entity in its own right, making the Convention binding not only on the governments of the member states but also on the supranational institutions of the EU.

====Denmark====
{{See also|Censorship in Denmark}}
Freedom of speech in Denmark is granted by [[Constitution of Denmark|Grundloven]]:<ref>[http://legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1587/file/c57ee1ef8edd6198a252e187fdf2.htm/preview Constitution of Denmark] (English translation).</ref>

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]

The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', of constitutional value, states, in its article 11:

:The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, save [if it is necessary] to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.

In addition, France adheres to the European Convention on Human Rights and accepts the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.

The [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|Press Law of 1881]], as amended, guarantees freedom of the press, subject to several exceptions. The Pleven Act of 1972 (after [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] [[Ren<U+00E9> Pleven]]) prohibits incitement to hatred, discrimination, slander and racial insults.<ref>''{{lang|fr|Loi n<U+00B0> 72-546 du 1 juillet 1972 relative <U+00E0> la lutte contre le racisme}}'', ''[[Journal Officiel de la R<U+00E9>publique Fran<U+00E7>aise|Journal Officiel]]'' of {{date|2 July 1972}}, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=19720702&pageDebut=06803 6803].</ref><ref name="marginalised">{{cite book | title= The European Court of Human Rights and the Rights of Marginalised Individuals and Minorities in National Context | chapter= Protecting Individuals from Minorities and Vulnerable Groups in the European Court of Human Rights: Litigation and Jurisprudence in France | page= 77 | first1= Emmanuelle | last1= Bribosia | first2= Isabelle | last2= Rorive | first3= Amaya <U+00DA>beda | last3= de Torres | editor1-first= Dia | editor1-last= Anagnostou | editor2-first= Evangelia | editor2-last= Psychogiopoulou | year= 2009 | publisher= [[Brill Publishers|Koninklijke Brill]] | isbn= 978-9004-17326-2 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RltWpF-C0gsC&pg=PA77}}</ref> The [[Gayssot Act]] of 1990 prohibits any racist, [[antisemitism|anti-Semite]], or xenophobic activities, including [[Holocaust denial]].<ref name="marginalised"/> The Law of {{date|30 December 2004}} prohibits hatred against people because of their gender, [[sexual orientation]], or  disability.<ref>{{cite book | title= Extreme Speech and Democracy | chapter= Hate Speech, Extreme Speech, and Collective Defamation in French Law | first= Pascal | last= Mbongo | editor1-first= Ivan | editor1-last= Hare | editor2-first= James | editor2-last= Weinstein | page= 229 | year= 2011 | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn= 978-0-19-954878-1 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=FKCD4SgeIicC&pg=PA229}}</ref>

An addition to the Public Health Code was passed on the 31 December 1970, which punishes the "positive presentation of drugs" and the "incitement to their consumption" with up to five years in prison and fines up to <U+20AC>76,000. Newspapers such as ''[[Lib<U+00E9>ration]]'', [[Charlie Hebdo]] and associations, political parties, and various publications criticizing the current drug laws and advocating drug reform in France have been repeatedly hit with heavy fines based on this law.

France does not implement any preliminary government censorship for written publications. Any violation of law must be processed through the courts.

The government has a commission recommending [[movie classification]]s, the decisions of which can be appealed before the courts. Another commission oversees publications for the youth. The Minister of the Interior can prohibit the sale of [[pornography|pornographic]] publications to minors, and can also prevent such publications from being publicly displayed or advertised; such decisions can be challenged before administrative courts.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000878175 Loi n<U+00B0> 49-956 du 16 juillet 1949 sur les publications destin<U+00E9>es <U+00E0> la jeunesse]</ref>

The government restricts the right of broadcasting to authorized radio and television channels; the authorizations are granted by an independent administrative authority; this authority has recently removed the broadcasting authorizations of some foreign channels because of their antisemitic content.

As part of "internal security" enactments passed in 2003, it is an offense to insult the national flag or anthem, with a penalty of a maximum 9,000 euro fine or up to six months' imprisonment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Restrictions on "offending the dignity of the republic", on the other hand, include "insulting" anyone who serves the public (potentially magistrates, police, firefighters, teachers and even bus conductors).{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The legislation reflects the debate that raged after incidents such as the booing of the "[[La Marseillaise]]" at a France vs. Algeria football match in 2002.

====Germany====

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Grundgesetz cover.jpg|frame|Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] -->
{{Wikisource|Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany}}
Freedom of expression is granted by Article 5 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], which also states that there is no censorship and freedom of expression may be limited by law.

The press is regulated by the [[law of Germany]] as well as all 16 [[States of Germany]].<ref>{{cite book | title= Handbook of Election Coverage Around the World | chapter= Characteristics and Dynamics of Election News Coverage in Germany | pages= 291<U+2013>292 | first1= Frank | last1= Esser | first2= Katharina | last2= Hemmer | editor1-first= Jesper | editor1-last= Str<U+00F6>mb<U+00E4>ck | editor2-first= Lynda Lee | editor2-last= Kaid | isbn= 978-0-8058-6037-5 | url= http://books.google.ch/books?id=gv0sxHwhLHAC&pg=PA291}}</ref> The most important and sometimes controversial regulations limiting speech and the press can be found in the [[Strafgesetzbuch|Criminal code]]:

* ''[[Insult]]'' is punishable under Section 185. [[Satire]] and similar forms of art enjoy more freedom but have to respect [[human dignity]] (Article 1 of the Basic law).
* ''[[Gossip|Malicious Gossip]]'' and ''Defamation'' (Section 186 and 187). Utterances about facts (opposed to personal judgement) are allowed if they are true and can be proven. Yet journalists are free to investigate without evidence because they are justified by ''Safeguarding Legitimate Interests'' (Section 193).
* ''Hate speech'' may be punishable if against ''segments of the population'' and ''in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace'' (Section 130 ''[Agitation of the People]''), including racist agitation and antisemitism.
* ''Holocaust denial'' is punishable according to Section 130 subsection 3.
* ''Membership in or support of banned political parties'' (Section 86). Currently the only banned party is the [[Nazi Party]], but historically all non-Nazi parties have been banned (1933<U+2013>1945), as well as the [[Communist Party]] (1933<U+2013>1945, 1956<U+2013>1968).
* ''Dissemination of Means of Propaganda of Unconstitutional Organizations'' (Section 86).
* ''Use of Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations'' (Section 86a). Items such as the [[Swastika]], but also the [[hammer and sickle]] when the Communist Party is banned.
* ''Disparagement of''
** ''the Federal President'' (Section 90).
** ''the State and its Symbols'' (Section 90a).
* ''Insult to Organs and Representatives of Foreign States'' (Section 103).
* ''Rewarding and Approving Crimes'' (Section 140).
* ''Casting False Suspicion'' (Section 164).
* ''Insulting of Faiths, Religious Societies and Organizations Dedicated to a Philosophy of Life if they could disturb public peace'' (Section 166).
* ''Dissemination of Pornographic Writings'' (Section 184).

====Greece====
The 14th article of the [[Constitution of Greece]] makes it an offence for the [[News media|press]] to insult the [[President of Greece]] as well as Christianity and any other religion recognized by the state.<ref>http://www.ekloges.gr/syntagmaDetails.asp?pageid=3&langid=1&ArthroID=16</ref>

====Ireland====
{{See also|Censorship in the Republic of Ireland}}
Freedom of speech is protected by Article 40.6.1 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. However the article qualifies this right, providing that it may not be used to undermine "public order or morality or the authority of the State". Furthermore, the constitution explicitly requires that the publication of "blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" be a criminal offence, leading the government to pass a new blasphemy law on 8 July 2009.

The scope of the protection afforded by this Article has been interpreted restrictively by the judiciary, largely as a result of the wording of the Article, which qualifies the right before articulating it. Indeed, until an authoritative pronouncement on the issue by the Supreme Court, many believed that the protection was restricted to "convictions and opinions" and, as a result, a separate right to communicate was, by necessity, implied into Article 40.3.2. This judicial conservatism is at variance with the concept of speech as a democratic imperative. This, albeit trite, justification for free speech has underpinned the liberal, progressive interpretation of the First Amendment by the United States Supreme Court.

Under the [[European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003]], all of the rights afforded by the European Convention form an integral part of the Republic of Ireland's laws. The act is, however, subordinate to the constitution.

==== Italy ====
[[Vilication]] of religion is illegal in Italy under Section 403 of the Criminal code;
Defamation is illegal under section 595;
Insult is illegal under Section 594;
[[Disparagement of the President of State]] is illegal under Section 278.

==== Malta ====
Blasphemy against the [[Roman Catholic]] church is illegal in Malta.<ref>Matthew Vella. http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2009/03/08/t13.html ''Maltatoday on Sunday'', 8 March 2009. Retrieved 2009-06-15.</ref>

====The Netherlands====
[[File:De schreeuw - oosterpark.jpg|thumb|''[[De Schreeuw]]'' (The Scream) is a memorial commemorating [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] and a symbol of the freedom of speech.]]

Article 7 of the Dutch [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Grondwet]] in its first paragraph grants everybody the right to make public ideas and feelings by printing them without prior censorship, but not exonerating the author from his liabilities under the law. The second paragraph says that radio and television will be regulated by law but that there will be no prior censorship dealing with the content of broadcasts. The third paragraph grants a similar freedom of speech as in the first for other means of making ideas and feelings public but allowing censorship for reasons of decency when the public that has access may be younger than sixteen years of age. The fourth and last paragraph exempts commercial advertising from the freedoms granted in the first three paragraphs.<ref>{{cite web|title=De Grondwet|publisher=www.overheid.nl|date=2011-04-29|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001840#Hoofdstuk1/Artikel7}}</ref>

The penal code has laws however sanctioning certain types of expression. Such laws and freedom of speech are at the centre of a public debate in The Netherlands after the arrest on 16 May 2008 of cartoonist Gregorius Nekschot. Jurisprudence from the 1960s prohibits prosecution of blasphemy. Parliament has recently expressed its wish to abolish the law penalizing blasphemy. The current Christian Democrat Justice Minister would however prefer to renew it and expand it to include non-religious philosophies of life, thus making it possible to anticipate and prevent international outcry similar to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. Laws that punish discriminatory speech also exist and are being used against Gregorius Nekschot. Laws on [[l<U+00E8>se majest<U+00E9>]] exist and are occasionally used to prosecute.

The [[Dutch Criminal Code]] <U+00A7> 137(c) criminalizes:<ref name="extreme_masses"/>

====Poland====
"Statutes of Wi<U+015B>lica" introduced in 1347 by [[Casimir III of Poland]] codified freedom of speech in medieval Poland e.g. book publishers were not to be persecuted. The Constitution of the Republic of Poland, specifically forbids, the existence of "''political parties and other organizations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of nazism, fascism and communism, as well as those whose programmes or activities sanction racial or national hatred, the application of violence for the purpose of obtaining power or to influence the State policy, or provide for the secrecy of their own structure or membership''". {{As of|2005}},{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} people are sometimes convicted and/or detained for about one day for insults to religious feeling (of the Roman Catholic Church){{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} or to [[Head of state|heads of state]] who are not yet, but soon will be, on Polish territory. On 18 July 2003, During 26<U+2013>27 January 2005, about 30 human rights activists were temporarily detained by the police, allegedly for insulting [[Vladimir Putin]], a visiting head of state. The activists were released after about 30 hours and only one was actually charged with insulting a foreign head of state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/2005/01/112837.shtml |title=28 Detained for insulting Putin? |accessdate=2007-05-07 |publisher=Independent Media Center}} {{cite web|url=http://pl.indymedia.org/pl/2005/01/11431.shtml|accessdate=2007-05-07 |publisher=centrum niezalez'nych medio'w Polska (Independent Media Center, Poland)|title=Relacja z demostracji w Krakowie|language=Polish}}</ref>

====Sweden====
{{See also|Censorship in Sweden}}
Freedom of speech is regulated in three parts of the [[Constitution of Sweden]].
*''{{lang|sv|Regeringsformen}}'', Chapter 2 (Fundamental Rights and Freedoms) protects personal freedom of expression "whether orally, pictorially, in writing, or in any other way".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6319.aspx |title=Chapter 2.

* ''{{lang|sv|Tryckfrihetsf<U+00F6>rordningen}}'' (Freedom of the Press Act) protects the freedom of printed press, as well as the principle of free access to public records (''{{lang|sv|offentlighetsprincipen}}'') and the right to [[whistleblower|communicate information to the press anonymously]]. For a newspaper to be covered by this law, it must be registered and have a "responsible editor".<ref>[http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_Page____8908.aspx Summary of The Freedom of the Press Act], [[Swedish Riksdag]]</ref>
* ''{{lang|sv|Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen}}'' (Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression) extends protections similar to those of ''{{lang|sv|Tryckfrihetsf<U+00F6>rordningen}}'' to other media, including television, radio and web sites.<ref>[http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_Page____8909.aspx Summary of The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression], [[Swedish Riksdag]]</ref>

UK laws on defamation are among the strictest in the western world, imposing a high burden of proof on the defendant. However, the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 guarantees freedom of speech (within institutions of further education and institutions of higher education) as long as it is within the law (see section 43 at http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/61). UK [[defamation]] law may have recently experienced a considerable liberalising effect as a result of the ruling in Jameel v [[Wall Street Journal]] in October 2006. A ruling of the [[House of Lords]]<U+2014>the then highest court of appeal<U+2014>revived the so-called [[Reynolds v Times Newspapers|''Reynolds'' Defence]], in which journalism undertaken in the public interest shall enjoy a complete defence against a libel suit. Conditions for the defence include the right of reply for potential claimants, and that the balance of the piece was fair in view of what the writer knew at the time. The ruling removed the awkward<U+2014>and hitherto binding<U+2014>conditions of being able to describe the publisher as being under a duty to publish the material and the public as having a definite interest in receiving it. The original House of Lords judgment in Reynolds was unclear and held 3<U+2013>2; whereas Jameel was unanimous and resounding. [[Lord Hoffman]]'s words, in particular, for how the judge at first instance had applied Reynolds so narrowly, were very harsh. Hoffman LJ made seven references to [[Eady J]], none of them favorable. He twice described his thinking as unrealistic and compared his language to "the jargon of the old Soviet Union."

The [[Video Recordings Act 2010]] requires most video recordings and some [[video games]] offered for sale in the United Kingdom to display a classification supplied by the [[BBFC]]. There are no set regulations as to what cannot be depicted in order to gain a classification as each scene is considered in the context of the wider intentions of the work; however images that could aid, encourage, or are a result of the committing of a crime, along with sustained and graphic images of torture or sexual abuse are the most likely to be refused. The objectionable material may be cut by the distributor in order to receive a classification, but with some works it may be deemed that no amount of cuts would be able to make the work suitable for classification, effectively banning that title from sale in the country. Recordings refused a classification by the BBFC may still be shown in [[cinemas]] providing the local authority, from which a cinema must have a licence to operate, will permit them.

===Norway===

Article 100 of the Norwegian [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]] has granted freedom of speech since 1814 and is mostly unchanged since then. Article 142 of the penal code is a law against blasphemy, but no one has been charged since 1933, though it was upheld as late as 2004. Article 135a of the penal code is a law against hate speech, which is debated and not widely used.

Article 100 in the Constitution states:
* There shall be freedom of expression.
* No person may be held liable in law for having imparted or received information, ideas or messages unless this can be justified in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression, which are the seeking of truth, the promotion of democracy and the individual's freedom to form opinions. Such legal liability shall be prescribed by law.
* Everyone shall be free to speak his mind frankly on the administration of the State and on any other subject whatsoever. Clearly defined limitations to this right may only be imposed when particularly weighty considerations so justify in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression.
*Prior censorship and other preventive measures may not be applied unless so required in order to protect children and young persons from the harmful influence of moving pictures. Censorship of letters may only be imposed in institutions.
*Everyone has a right of access to documents of the State and municipal administration and a right to follow the proceedings of the courts and democratically elected bodies. Limitations to this right may be prescribed by law to protect the privacy of the individual or for other weighty reasons.
*It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions that facilitate open and enlightened public discourse.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss Constitution also guarantees Freedom of speech and Freedom of information for every citizen (Article 16).<ref>[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/101/a16.html Article 16 of the Swiss Constitution]</ref> But still the country makes some controversial decisions, which both Human Right Organizations and other states criticizes. The Swiss Animal Right organization "Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz" took the country to the European Court of Human Rights twice for censoring a TV-Advertisement of the organization, in which the livestock farming of pigs is shown. The organization won both lawsuits, and the Swiss state was convicted to pay compensations.<ref>[http://www.3sat.de/3sat.php?http://www.3sat.de/kulturzeit/news/113962/index.html German: 3sat TV: Switzerland's violation against Freedom of speech]</ref> Another very controversial law of Switzerland is that persons who refuse to recognize genocide like the [[Armenian Massacre]] of 1915 have to face trial. The Turkish politician [[Do<U+011F>u Perin<U+00E7>ek]] was fined CHF 12,000 for denying the existence of the Genocide in 2007. Switzerland was criticized by Turkish media and Turkish politicians for acting against the freedom of opinion. Perin<U+00E7>ek's application for a revision was rejected by the court.<ref>[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/Turkish_politician_fined_over_genocide_denial.html?siteSect=105&sid=7603245 Turkish politician fined over genocide denial]</ref> Holocaust denial is also illegal.

===Turkey===
{{See also|Censorship in Turkey}}
Article 26 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]] guarantees the right to "Freedom of Expression and Dissemination of Thought". Moreover, the Republic of Turkey is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights and submits to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The constitutional freedom of expression may be limited by provisions in other laws, such as Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, which outlaws denigration of the Turkish Nation, while also providing that "expression of thought intended to criticize shall not constitute a crime".

===Canada===
{{Further|History of free speech in Canada|Censorship in Canada}}

Freedom of expression in Canada is guaranteed by [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(b)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]:

:2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: ... (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication

[[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 1]] of the Charter, the so-called limitations clause, establishes that the guarantee of freedom of expression and other rights under the Charter are not absolute and can be limited under certain situations:
:The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it ''subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society''. (emphasis added)

This section is double-edged. First it implies that a limitation on freedom of speech prescribed in law can be permitted, if it can be justified as being a reasonable limit in a free and democratic society. Conversely, it implies that a restriction can be invalidated, if it cannot be shown to be a reasonable limit in a free and democratic society.

Other laws that protect freedom of speech in Canada, and did so, to a limited extent, before the Charter was enacted in 1982, include the [[Implied Bill of Rights]] and the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]''.

In the landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case ''[[R. v. Zundel]]'' (1992), the court struck down a provision in the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] that prohibited publication of false information or news, stating that it violated section 2(b) of the Charter.

Under section 318 of the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to promote genocide. Under section 319, it is illegal to publicly incite hatred against people based on their colour, race, religion, ethnic origin, and sexual orientation, except where the statements made are true or are made in good faith. The prohibition against inciting hatred based on sexual orientation was added to the section in 2004 with the passage of [[Bill C-250]].

Canada has had a string of high-profile court cases in which writers and publishers have been prosecuted for their writings, in both magazines and web postings:

* In February 2006, Calgary Muslim leader Syed Soharwardy filed a human rights complaint against ''[[Western Standard]]'' publisher [[Ezra Levant]]. Levant was compelled to appear before the Alberta Human Rights Commission to discuss his intention in publishing the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons]]. Levant posted a video of the hearing on [[YouTube]]. Levant questioned the competence of the Commission to take up the issue, and challenged it to convict him, "and sentence me to the apology", stating that he would then take "this junk into the real courts, where eight hundred years of common law" would come to his aid. In February 2008, Soharwardy dropped the complaint noting that "most Canadians see this as an issue of freedom of speech, that that principle is sacred and holy in our society."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=7e0d6665-0c5d-41b8-a706-d95f3b0329be |title=Imam drops rights dispute |date=13 February 2008 |publisher=Calgary Herald |accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>
* In May 2006, the [http://www.theecmc.com/ Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities] filed another Human Rights complaint against the ''Western Standard'' over the publishing of the cartoons. In August 2008, the [http://www.albertahumanrights.ab.ca/ Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship (AHRC) Commission] dismissed the complaint, stating that, <U+201C>given the full context of the republication of the cartoons, the very strong language defining hatred and contempt in the case law as well as consideration of the importance of freedom of speech and the <U+2018>admonition to balance,<U+2019> the southern director concludes that there is no reasonable basis in the information for this complaint to proceed to a panel hearing.<U+201D><ref name=complaintdismissal>[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15181&Itemid=86 Human rights complaint dismissal spurs more debate] by Paul Lungen, Canadian Jewish News, 21 August 2008. Retrieved 21 October 2008.</ref>
* In 2007, a complaint was filed with the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] related to an article "The Future Belongs to Islam," written by [[Mark Steyn]], published in ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine. The complainants alleged that the article and ''Maclean's'' refusal to provide space for a rebuttal violated their human rights. The complainants also claimed that the article was one of twenty-two ''Maclean's'' articles, many written by Steyn, about Muslims. Further complaints were filed with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] and the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]]. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the complaint in June 2008.<ref>[[Mark Steyn#Canadian Islamic Congress human rights complaint|Mark Steyn: Canadian Islamic Congress human rights complaint]], English Wikipedia, 7 March 2012</ref>
* A Montreal [[Neo-Nazism in Canada|neo-Nazi]], Jean-Sebastien Presseault, received a six-month prison sentence for willfully promoting hatred toward blacks and Jews on his website. Calling Presseault's opinions "vile" and "nauseating," Quebec Court Judge Martin Vauclair sent the heavily tattooed man back to jail. The 24 tattoos, including several [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] covering the defendant's torso, figure prominently in Vauclair's decision to give jail time, as opposed to a sentence to be served in the community, as the defence had hoped. "The violence he inflicted on his own body to leave almost-indelible marks of his convictions testify as to his unresolved frustrations but also to his deep-seated racist and hateful beliefs," Vauclair said.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=a4be478b-81fd-47fc-9f7b-1289a514435f&k=47888 "Montreal man jailed for racist website"], ''Montreal Gazette'', 24 January 2007</ref>

Historically, local communities and governments have sometimes sought to place limits upon speech that was deemed subversive or unpopular. There was a significant struggle for the right to free speech on the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] in the 1960s. And, in the period from 1906 to 1916, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], a working class union, found it necessary to engage in [[free speech fights]] intended to secure the right of union organizers to speak freely to wage workers. These free speech campaigns were sometimes quite successful, although participants often put themselves at great risk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Freedom of speech is also sometimes limited to [[free speech zone]]s, which can take the form of a wire fence enclosure, barricades, or an alternative venue designed to segregate speakers according to the content of their message. There is much controversy surrounding the creation of these areas <U+2014> the mere existence of such zones is offensive to some people, who maintain that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] makes the entire country an unrestricted free speech zone.<ref name="ACLU">[http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11423prs20030923.html Secret Service Ordered Local Police to Restrict Anti-Bush Protesters at Rallies, ACLU Charges in Unprecedented Nationwide Lawsuit].

Neither the federal nor state governments engage in preliminary censorship of movies. However, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] has a [[Motion picture rating system#United States|rating system]], and movies not rated by the MPAA cannot expect anything but a very limited release in theatres. Since the organization is private, no recourse to the courts is available. The rules implemented by the MPAA are more restrictive than the ones implemented by most First World countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} However, unlike comparable public or private institutions in other countries, the MPAA does ''not'' have the power to limit the retail sale of movies in tape or disc form based on their content, nor does it affect movie distribution in public (i.e., government-funded) libraries. Since 2000, it has become quite common for movie studios to release "unrated" DVD versions of films with MPAA-censored content put back in.

Unlike what has been called a strong international consensus that hate speech needs to be prohibited by law and that such prohibitions override, or are irrelevant to, guarantees of freedom of expression, the United States is perhaps unique among the developed world in that under law, hate speech is legal.<ref>{{cite paper|title=The Exceptional First Amendment|first=Frederick|last=Schauer|date=February 2005|work=Working Paper Series from [[Harvard University]], [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]|doi=10.2139/ssrn.668543|quote=On this cluster of interrelated topics, there appears to be a strong international consensus that the principles of freedom of expression are either overridden or irrelevant when what is being expressed is racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. ... In contrast to this international consensus that various forms of hate speech need to be prohibited by law and that such prohibition creates no or few free speech issues, the United States remains steadfastly committed to the opposite view. ... In much of the developed world, one uses racial epithets at one's legal peril, one displays Nazi regalia and the other trappings of ethnic hatred at significant legal risk and one urges discrimination against religious minorities under threat of fine or imprisonment, but in the United States, all such speech remains constitutionally protected.}}</ref> 

For instance, in July 2012 a US court ruled that advertisements with the slogan, "In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel Defeat Jihad", are constitutionally protected speech and the government must allow their display in New York subways.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19665225 "Pro-Israel 'Defeat Jihad' ads to hit New York subway"], BBC News, 20 September 2012</ref> In response on 27 September 2012 [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] approved new guidelines for subway advertisements, prohibiting those that it <U+201C>reasonably foresees would imminently incite or provoke violence or other immediate breach of the peace.<U+201D> The MTA believes the new guidelines adhere to the court<U+2019>s ruling and will withstand any potential [[First Amendment]] challenge. Under the new policy, the authority will continue to allow so-called viewpoint ads, but will require a disclaimer on each ad noting that it does not imply the authority<U+2019>s endorsement of its views.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/nyregion/mta-amends-rules-after-pro-israel-ads-draw-controversy.html?_r=1&hp "M.T.A.

==South America==
[[File:Brazilprotesters.jpg|thumb|In Brazil, [[freedom of assembly]] and expression are Constitutional rights.]]

===Brazil===
In Brazil, freedom of expression is a Constitutional right. Article Five of the [[Constitution of Brazil]] establishes that ''the expression of thought is free, anonymity being forbidden''. Furthermore, ''the expression of intellectual, artistic, scientific, and communications activities is free, independently of censorship or license''. However, there are legal provisions criminalizing the desecration of religious artifacts at the time of worship, hate speech, racism, defamation, calumny and libel. Brazilian Law also forbids "unjust and grave threats".

Historically, freedom of speech has been a right in Brazilian Law since the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Imperial Constitution (1824<U+2013>1889)|1824 Constitution]] was enacted, though it was banned by the [[Get<U+00FA>lio Vargas|Vargas dictatorship]] and severely restricted under the [[Military dictatorship (Brazil)|military dictatorship in 1964<U+2013>85]].
