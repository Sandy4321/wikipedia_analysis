'''''Asplenium scolopendrium''''' (syn. ''Phyllitis scolopendrium'', '''Hart's-tongue Fern''') is a [[fern]] in the genus ''[[Asplenium]]''. The species, with its close relative ''[[Asplenium sagittatum]]'', is sometimes placed in the segregate genus ''Phyllitis''.  ''Asplenium scolopendrium'' is a common species in [[Europe]], but in [[North America]] occurs as rare, widely scattered populations that are sometimes given varietal status, ''A. scolopendrium'' var. ''americanum''.  Morphological differences are minor but the North American populations are [[tetraploid]], whereas those occurring in Europe are [[diploid]]. Another variety occurs in southern [[Mexico]] and [[Hispaniola]], ''A. scolopendrium'' var. ''lindenii''.

The plants are unusual in being ferns with simple, undivided [[frond]]s.  The leaves are 10-60 cm long and 3-6 cm broad, with [[sori]] arranged in rows perpendicular to the rachis.  The plants grow on neutral and lime-rich substrates, including moist soil and damp crevices in old walls, most commonly in shaded situations but occasionally in full sun; plants in full sun are usually stunted and yellowish in colour, while those in full shade are dark green and luxuriant.  The tongue-shaped leaves have given rise to the common name "Hart's tongue fern".  The sori pattern is reminiscent of a centipede's legs, and ''scolopendrium'' is Latin for "centipede".

''Asplenium scolopendrium'' can form hybrids with other ''Asplenium'' species, including those species sometimes classified in the separate genus ''Camptosorus'', one reason why both ''Phyllitis'' and ''Camptosorus'' are included in ''Asplenium'' by some pteridologists. A recent phylogenetic study of Aspleniaceae (Murakami et al. 1999) suggests that ''A. scolopendrium'' is only distantly related to other ''Asplenium'' species and that the genus ''Phyllitis'' should be recognized.

===Cultivation and uses===
''Asplenium scolopendrium'' is often grown as an [[ornamental plant]], with several [[cultivar]]s selected with varying frond form, including with frilled frond margins, forked fronds and cristate forms. The [[Americas|American]] populations are reputed to be difficult to cultivate, and most, if not all, cultivated plants are derived from European forms.

This fern had use in folk medicine as a [[spleen]] tonic.
