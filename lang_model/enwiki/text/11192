{{Culture of Croatia}}
'''Television in Croatia''' was first [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1956]]. As of 2012 there are 10 nationwide and 21 regional [[DVB-T]] (Digital Video Broadcasting <U+2013> Terrestrial) television channels, and more than 30 other channels either produced in the [[Republic of Croatia]] or produced for the Croatian market and broadcast via [[IPTV]] (Internet Protocol television), [[cable television|cable]] or [[satellite television]]. The electronic communications market in Croatia is regulated by the [[Croatian Post and Electronic Communications Agency]] (HAKOM), which issues [[broadcast license]]s and monitors the market. The DVB-T and satellite transmission infrastructure is developed and maintained by the state-owned company [[Oda<U+0161>ilja<U+010D>i i veze]] (OiV).

The first television signal broadcast in Croatia occurred in 1939 during the [[Zagreb Fair]], where [[Philips]] showcased its television system. The first regular broadcasts started in 1956, when [[Radio Television Zagreb|Television Zagreb]] was established as the first TV station in the [[Yugoslav Radio Television]] system. Color broadcasts began in 1975. Coverage and number of channels grew steadily, and by the 2000s there were four channels with nationwide coverage in Croatia. DVB-T signal broadcasts began in 2002, and in 2010 a full [[digital switchover]] was completed. During that period the IPTV, cable and satellite television markets grew considerably, and by 2011 only 60.7 percent of households received DVB-T television only; the remainder were subscribed to IPTV, cable and satellite TV in addition, or as the sole source of TV reception. As of January 2012 DVB-T is broadcast in three [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexes]], while the territory of Croatia is divided into nine main allotment regions and smaller local allotments corresponding to major cities. [[High-definition television]] (HDTV) is broadcast only through IPTV, although HDTV DVB-T test programming was broadcast from 2007 to 2011. A [[DVB-T2]] test broadcast was conducted in 2011.

Television in Croatia, as all other [[Media of Croatia|media in the country]] are criticised for lack of balance of global issues and trends on one hand and national topics covered on the other. All major television networks in Croatia are generally thought to be under excessive influence of [[commercialism]]. [[State ownership|State owned]] [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] is required to produce and broadcast educational programmes, [[Television documentary|documentaries]], and programmes aimed at the [[Croatian diaspora|diaspora]] and national minorities in Croatia. The television in Croatia is considered to be important in avenue for [[non-governmental organization]]s communicating their concerns to the public and to criticising the [[Government of Croatia|authorities]]. Television is the primary source of information for 57% of the [[population of Croatia]].

Zagreb was one of the first European capitals where television pictures were broadcast. Beginning on 26 August 1939 the[[Zagreb Fair]] featured a [[Philips]] television system, operated for short periods each day of the exhibition (until 4 September). The Philips television, consisting of a transmitter and several receivers, was operated by [[History of Dutch television|Eric Klaas de Vries]] in the Dutch pavilion at the fair. The fair newspaper announced the event as the first, after television broadcasts in London and Berlin. The programming consisted of comedy, opera, music performances and the first TV news broadcast in Croatia.<ref name="JL-Philips">{{cite news|publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/1939--prva-tv-slika-u-hrvatskoj/152308/|language=Croatian|title=1939. prva TV slika u Hrvatskoj|trans_title=The first TV image in Croatia in 1939|date=26 August 2008|authors=Ivana Rimac, Ivana <U+017D>ivko|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>

The Zagreb TV centre became a member of the [[Yugoslav Radio Television]] (JRT) (an umbrella organization of television stations in Yugoslavia), acting as [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]] Technical Centre for the JRT. In 1972 Television Zagreb began broadcasting of its second channel, and switched to airing its programming in color in 1975. The third Television Zagreb channel was introduced in 1988, and [[teletext]] service was launched in 1990. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], Television Zagreb was renamed [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] (HRT) and it became a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]; however, HRT suffered significant [[Croatian War of Independence|war damage]] to its infrastructure as 80 percent of its transmitters and 30 relay stations were damaged, destroyed or occupied. In October 1999 all three nationwide HRT channels started broadcasting around the clock, but in 2002 the third HRT channel ceased operation.<ref name="HRT-Evolution"/> [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], the first privately-owned television station in Croatia, began operating in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Nova TV (Croatia)]]|url=http://novatv.hr/o_nama/|title=O nama|trans_title=About us|language=Croatian|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref> It was followed by another privately-owned broadcaster, [[RTL Televizija]], on 30 April 2004.

===End of analog broadcasting===
{{also|Digital television transition}}
The [[Government of Croatia]] decided that [[multicast]] (simultaneous [[Analog television|analog]] and [[digital]] [[DVB-T]]broadcasting of the main channels) was to cease in 2010.<ref name="DVB-Strategy"/> The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. The analog broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010.

===Multiplexes===
There are three active [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexes]] (MUX) in Croatia. MUX A and MUX B are reserved for nationwide channels, and MUX D is used for channels broadcast locally and nationwide. MUX A broadcasts HRT 1, HRT 2 , Nova TV, RTL and ''Moja uprava'' channels. MUX B broadcasts RTL2 and Doma TV. MUX D broadcasts three nationwide channels<U+2014>Sportska Televizija, Kapital Network (KN) and CMC<U+2014>in addition to local TV channels.<ref name="OIV-DVBTable"/>

A competition for two channels in MUX B was announced in July 2010, and HAKOM received offers for the following channels: RTL 2, Doma TV, OBN and KN. Finally, licenses were given to RTL 2 and Doma TV.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/na-dvije-nove-televizije-pocetku-tek-tri-nove-domace-emisije-clanak-233218|language=Croatian|title=Na dvije nove televizije u po<U+010D>etku tek tri nove doma<U+0107>e emisije|trans_title=Two new television channels with only three new nationally produced shows|date=28 December 2010|authors=Bo<U+017E>ena Matijevi<U+0107>, Antonio Mandir|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> RTL2 and Doma TV began broadcasting on 2 January 2011. Licences for broadcasting in the national segment of Mux D were given to Croatian Music Channel (CMC), Sportska Televizija (owned by the [[Croatian Olympic Committee]]) and KN in December 2010. They started broadcasting in late March and early April 2011.<ref name="OIV-DVBTable"/> KN was originally broadcast in MUX B; as holder of a [[television license|license]] for a testing period, they won an experimental 6-month period license (and later switched to MUX D, which carries both local and nationwide services simultaneously). MUX B also carries two new channels<U+2014>HRT 3 and HRT 4. The two are expected to begin broadcasting by the end of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Radiotelevision|url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=186&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=141139&cHash=6a0075ced0|language=Croatian|title=Programska mjesta HRT3 i HRT4 u mre<U+017E>i MUX B|trans_title=HRT3 and HRT4 channel slots in MUX B network|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition and the interests of service users in the field of electronic communication services and infrastructure, while contributing to the development of the internal market of the [[European Union]].<ref name="NN-HAKOM">{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne Novine]]|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2008_06_73_2420.html|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o elektroni<U+010D>kim komunikacijama|trans_title=Electronic Communications Act|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia.<ref name="HAKOM-Mission">{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Post and Electronic Communications Agency]]|title=Mission, values, goals|accessdate=1 January 2012|url=http://www.hakom.hr/default.aspx?id=203}}</ref> Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of [[Minor (law)|minors]], restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, [[profanity]], use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programme&mdash;advising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively. The restriction does not apply to educational, documentary, science or news programming.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Narodne novine]]|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_05_60_1957.html|language=Croatian|title=Pravilnik o za<U+0161>titi maloljetnika|trans_title=Regulation on protection of minors|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>

HAKOM grants, evaluates and revokes [[broadcast license]]s for all forms of electronic communications in Croatia, approves mergers of communications-industry companies, imposes fines on those who are found to be in breach of applicable regulation and conducts constant supervision of the industry.<ref name="NN-HAKOM"/>

==Language localisation==
National legislation requires that all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia are made in [[Croatian language]] or with appropriate translations either using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]]. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a [[soap opera]] was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20061207/reflektor03.asp|title=<U+0160>varci (ne)<U+0107>e "<U+0161>prehati" hrvatski|language=Croatian|trans_title=Schwarzie will (not) "sprechen" Croatian|date=7 December 2006|author=Sini<U+0161>a Pavi<U+0107>|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> The legislation does not provide for [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding [[language localisation]] of television programmes made in [[Serbian language]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|title='Ko nas bre prevodi?' <U+2013> Vije<U+0107>e zna da je zakon lo<U+0161>, ali ga ipak provodi|trans_title="Who's translating us?" - The Council knows that the legislation is poor, but it enforces it anyway|date=27 January 2012|author=Milena Zajovi<U+0107>|accessdate=5 July 2012url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/ko-nas-bre-prevodi-vijece-zna-da-je-zakon-los-ali-ga-ipak-provodi-clanak-370505}}</ref> Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using [[teletext]] service normally used for [[closed captioning]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Mozaik/tabid/80/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/163322/Default.aspx|language=Croatian|title=Eureka!

==Social impact==
Television in Croatia, as all other [[Media of Croatia|media in the country]] are criticised for lack of balance of global issues and trends on one hand and national topics covered on the other. All major television networks in Croatia are generally thought to be under excessive influence of [[commercialism]]. This is viewed through international ownership structures of the privately owned television broadcasters having little regard for promotion of national culture and social issues, as well as through efforts of the state-run HRT to attract advertisers through programming that is thought to appeal to the viewers the best in spite of regulation of programming content and restricted advertising at the HRT.<ref name="Malovi<U+0107>">{{cite journal|journal=Kolo|publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]]|issue=2|year=2005|issn=1331-0992|author=Stjepan Malovi<U+0107>|title=Odnos masovnih medija i kulture|trans_title=Relationship of mass media and culture|language=Croatian|url=http://www.matica.hr/Kolo/kolo2005_2.nsf/AllWebDocs/smalovic|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="<U+010C>erkez">{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=64293&lang=en|language=Croatian|title=Osnovna obilje<U+017E>ja medijske komunikacije u demokratskoj kulturi|trans_title=The basic characteristics of media communications in a democratic culture|author=Ivana <U+010C>erkez|volume=18|issue=1|month=March|year=2009|pages=28-45|journal=Socijalna ekologija: Journal for Environmental Thought and Sociological Research|publisher=Croatian Sociological Society, Institute of Sociology at Faculty of Philosophy, [[University of Zagreb]]|issn=1330-0113|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> The HRT is limited by a special legislation regulating that broadcaster to four minutes of advertising in [[prime time]] period between 6 and 10 in the evening.<ref name="HRT-Act">{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=48&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=96560&cHash=c7a3d3a725|title=Prihva<U+0107>en Zakon o HRT-u|trans_title=HRT Act passed|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, the HRT receives income from a fee charged to owners of [[television set]]s in Croatia in the amount of 1.5% of average monthly net [[wage]] in Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Narodne novine]]|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/304950.html|title=Zakon o Hrvatskoj radioteleviziji|language=Croatian|trans_title=Croatian Radiotelevision Act|date=19 February 2003|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> In 2012, the fee charged is 80&nbsp;[[Croatian kuna|kuna]]s ({{circa}} 10.60&nbsp;[[Euro]]s).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/167662/Default.aspx|language=Croatian|title=Odobreni ve<U+0107>i prosvjedi; Milanovi<U+0107>: Brodogradnja <U+0107>e opstati; HRT ostaje na 80 kn|trans_title=Larger protests approved; Milanovi<U+0107>: Shipbuilding shall survive; HRT remains at 80 kuna|date=15 March 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> In 2010, annual income of the HRT generated by the fee amounted to 1.2&nbsp;billion kunas ({{circa}} 160&nbsp;million Euros).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/drzava-hrt-u-dala-vise-nego-sto-su-svi-drugi-zaradili-oglasima-clanak-204368|title=Dr<U+017E>ava HRT-u dala vi<U+0161>e nego <U+0161>to su svi drugi zaradili na oglasima|trans_title=The state gave the HRT more than everyone else earned through advertising|date=17 October 2010|author=Lidija Kiseljak|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref>

Even though social impact of television in Croatia is considered to be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for [[non-governmental organization]]s to communicate their concerns to the public and to criticise the [[Government of Croatia|government]] and other aspects of [[politics of Croatia]].<ref name="<U+010C>erkez"/> Television is the most widespread source of information in Croatia&mdash;on average 57% of the [[population of Croatia]] uses television as their primary source of information. That percentage varies significantly by [[List of regions of Croatia|geographic region]]&mdash;from 43% in Zagreb and areas surrounding the capital to 79% in [[Slavonia]]&mdash;but in every region it surpasses all other sources of information, the second most widely used source of information being the [[Internet]] averaging at 19%.<ref name="Primary">{{cite web|publisher=[[Poslovni dnevnik]]|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/hrvati-najvise-koriste-televiziju-kao-izvor-informiranja-174661.aspx|language=Croatian|title=Hrvati najvi<U+0161>e koriste televiziju kao izvor informiranja|trans_title=Croats most often use television as a source of information|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> There are 1.584&nbsp;million registered television sets in the country.<ref name="yearbook">{{Croatia Yearbook 2011|page=495|chapter=Culture, arts and sprot|author=}}</ref>
