Bristol, the largest city in [[South West England]], has an [[Eclecticism#Architecture and art|eclectic]] combination of [[architectural]] styles, ranging from the [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] to 20th century [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] and beyond. During the mid-19th century, [[Bristol Byzantine]], an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived.

Buildings from most of the [[architecture of the United Kingdom|architectural periods]] of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the [[medieval era]], as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large [[Tudor period|Tudor]] mansions built for wealthy merchants. [[Almshouses]] and [[public houses]] of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it [[Conurbation|merged]] with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a [[parish church]].

The construction of the city's [[Bristol Harbour|floating harbour]], taking in the wharves on the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] and [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]], provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] designed  [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] and [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Temple Meads terminus]]; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]], but is now closed pending a planned move to London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/ |title=Empire and Us |work=British Empire & Commonwealth Museum |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref>

The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the [[University of Bristol]] and the arrival of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the [[Bristol city centre|city centre]] suffered from extensive bombing during the [[Bristol Blitz]]. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day.

===Defensive===

The city was defended in medieval times by [[Bristol Castle]], a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] fortification built on the site of a wooden predecessor. The castle played a key role in the civil wars that followed the death of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]] reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Potter |first=K. R. |authorlink= |coauthors=R.H.C.

===Religious===

The earliest surviving church in Bristol is [[St James' Priory, Bristol|St James' Priory]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St James | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380890 | accessdate=25 October 2006}}</ref> in Horsefair, Whitson Street. It was founded in 1129, as a [[Benedictine]] priory, by [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert Rufus]]. The 12th century also saw the founding of [[All Saints, Bristol|All Saints]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of All Saints  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379381 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> and [[St Philip and Jacob, Bristol|St Philip and Jacob]]<ref>{{Cite web| title= Church of St Philip and St Jacob | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380710 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> churches.<ref name="burrough"/> [[Temple Church, Bristol|Temple Church]], now in ruins, was built on the site of the oval church of the [[Knights Templar]], a Christian military order forcibly disbanded in 1312. Either just before or just after the disappearance of the Templars, the church was rebuilt on a rectangular plan and served as a parish church.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Temple Church | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380791 | accessdate=28 July 2006}}</ref>

[[St Mark's Church, Bristol|St Mark's Church]] was built around 1220.<ref>{{Cite web| title= Church of St Mark, Lord Mayor's Chapel | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379312 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> Soon after, the foundations were laid for [[Holy Trinity Church, Westbury on Trym|Holy Trinity Church]] in [[Westbury on Trym]].<ref>{{Cite web| title= Church of the Holy Trinity | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379174 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> The 12th century also saw the foundation of [[St Mary Redcliffe]],<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St Mary Redcliffe | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380316 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> renowned as one of the finest examples of the 15th century [[English Gothic architecture|Perpendicular style]], and the tallest building in the city. [[Elizabeth I]], on a visit to the city in 1574, described it as the "fairest, goodliest and most famous parish church in England".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivebeenthere.co.uk/places/united-kingdom/bristol/tips/architecture |title=Bristol / architecture  |accessdate=27 March 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> These 12th century churches were followed in the 14th century by the construction of [[Church of St John the Baptist, Bristol|Church of St John the Baptist]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St John the Baptist and St John's Gate  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379019 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> and [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St Stephen | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380504 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref>

Westbury College was a 13th century College of Priests located in [[Westbury on Trym, Bristol|Westbury-on-Trym]]. A [[Westbury College Gatehouse|gatehouse]], now a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property,<ref>{{Cite web| title=Westbury College and College House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379328 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> was added in the 15th century.

==Tudor (15th&nbsp;<U+2013> early 17th century)==
[[Image:Redlodge.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Red Lodge]].]]
The [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] architectural period, which lasted from the late 15th century into the early 17th century, saw the development of large estates such as [[Ashton Court]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Ashton Court Mansion and Stables | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=33487 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> They were built for the local merchants, who gained much of their wealth from the trade passing through [[Bristol Harbour]]. [[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Red Lodge]] was constructed in 1580 for John Yonge as the lodge for a great house that once stood on the site of the present [[Colston Hall]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Red Lodge and attached rubble walls and entrance steps  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380113 | accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> In 1615, a number of houses were demolished for the development of the new Fishmarket.<ref name = "Hovel_Tower">{{Cite web| title=Architecture:From Hovel to Tower| work=About Bristol | url=http://www.about-bristol.co.uk/arc-00.asp | accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>

During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Royal Fort]] was considered the strongest part of Bristol's defences, and it was to the fort that the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] retreated when they found themselves under siege from the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished.<ref name = "Fort_Steps">{{Cite web| title= Royal Fort and attached front step railings | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380730 | accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> [[St Nicholas's Almshouses]] were built in 1652<ref>{{Cite web| title=St Nicholas' Almshouses, Nos.1<U+2013>10 | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379882 | accessdate=21 February 2007}}</ref> to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the [[Llandoger Trow]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Llandoger Trow | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379857 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref> on [[King Street, Bristol|King Street]] and the [[Hatchet Inn, Bristol|Hatchet Inn]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=No.1 The Palace Hotel  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380829 | accessdate=15 May 2007}}</ref> More churches were built, including [[St Michael on the Mount Without]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St Michael and attached railings  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380470 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> It served the St Michaels hill area, one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre.<ref name="dbrown"/> The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls, and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs, such as the villages of  [[Horfield]] and [[Brislington]]. Both had their own churches, the [[Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380800 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> and [[St Luke's Church, Brislington|St Lukes]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St Luke  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379146 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> respectively.

[[Image:Kings Weston House crop.jpg|thumb|[[Kings Weston House]].]]
The [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] or [[English Baroque]] period (1666<U+2013>1713) saw more expansion of the city. Large mansions such as [[Kings Weston House]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Kings Weston House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379894 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> and [[Goldney Hall]]<ref name = "Goldney_House">{{Cite web| title=Goldney House and attached walls  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379240 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> were constructed. The needs of the poor and destitute became the responsibility of institutions such as [[Colstons Almshouses|Colstons]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Colstons Almshouses | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380472 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> and the [[Merchant Venturers Almshouses]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Merchant Venturers' Almshouses | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379881 | accessdate=21 February 2007}}</ref>  The [[King Street, Bristol|King Street]] area was developed outside the "Back Street Gate" of the city, home to the [[King William and Naval Volunteer Public Houses]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=King William and Naval Volunteer Public Houses | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379866 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref> The nearby [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] was planned during this era. In 1669, a series of four flights of steps, now called [[Christmas Steps (road)|Christmas Steps]], was constructed to replace a steep, muddy, and narrow street formerly known as Queene Street.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Christmas Steps | work=About Bristol | url=http://www.about-bristol.co.uk/out-02.asp | accessdate=13 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=history | work=Christmas Steps | url=http://www.christmassteps.co.uk/ | accessdate=13 May 2007}}</ref> Many of the larger houses of this period, including Queen Square, were built for merchant families who were heavily involved in the [[History of slavery|slave triangle]], importing goods from slave plantations.

In addition to evidence of the wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. Bristol's [[Hannah More]] was an influential member of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade. In the [[Seven Stars Public House, Bristol|Seven Stars Public House]] [[Thomas Clarkson]] collected evidence for [[William Wilberforce]] on the cruelty of the trade in humans.

Several residential squares with terraces of three storey houses were laid out around central gardens. An example is [[Portland Square, Bristol|Portland Square]], which was built between 1789 and 1820, and is now largely occupied by offices. In the 1830s, much of [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] was rebuilt following damage caused during the [[Bristol Riots]],<ref>Andrew Foyle, ''Bristol'', Pevsner Architectural Guides (2004) ISBN 0-300-10442-1</ref> and to the north of the city, Kings Square.

===Regency (early 19th century)===
[[Image:Victoria Rooms (750px).jpg|thumb|[[The Victoria Rooms]].]]
The term [[Regency architecture]] refers primarily to buildings of the early 19th century, when [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George&nbsp;IV]] was still [[Prince Regent]], and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style of architecture, adding an elegance and lightness of touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door<U+2014>usually coloured black<U+2014>framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, often in a setting of trees and shrubs.<ref name="dbrown"/> Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], whose most notable work in Bristol is [[Blaise Hamlet]], a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of [[Quaker]] banker and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[John Scandrett Harford]], who owned [[Blaise Castle]] House. The cottages are now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

The [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] and [[Cotham, Bristol|Cotham]] areas provide examples of the developments from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and at right angles to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic [[medieval]] [[Gothic revival|gothic]] style appeared, partially as a backlash to the [[symmetry]] of [[Palladianism]], and can be seen in buildings such as [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]],<ref>{{Cite web| title=City Museum and Art Gallery and attached front walls  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380277 | accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> [[Royal West of England Academy]],<ref>{{Cite web| title=Royal West of England Academy | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380286 | accessdate=9 May 2006}}</ref> and [[The Victoria Rooms]].<ref name = "Victoria_Rooms">{{Cite web| title=Victoria Rooms and attached railings and gates | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380288 | accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref> [[St Mary on the Quay]] church was built between 1839 and 1843, by [[Richard Shackleton Pope]], as a Catholic apostolic chapel for the [[Irvingite]] congregation: it is now a Roman Catholic church.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Church of St Mary-on-the-Quay  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379331 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref>

==Victorian (late 19th century)==
[[Image:Merchanthall.JPG|thumb|[[Merchant Hall]], [[Clifton Down]].]]
The [[Victorian era]] saw further expansion of the city, both in its industrial heartland around the docks and in the suburbs, particularly in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]].

Palatial squares were developed for the prosperous middle classes. [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] and [[Greek Revival architecture|Grecian]] villas, made with [[Bath Stone]] and sitting in their own gardens, were built in areas such as [[Clifton Down]]. At the same time, hundreds of acres of working class and artisan homes were built, especially in the south and east of the city.<ref name="dbrown"/> To support the growing population, public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital (now [[Glenside, Bristol|Glenside]]), schools such as [[Clifton College]] and public houses such as the [[Mauretania Public House]] were constructed.<ref>{{Cite web| title=The Mauretania Public House  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380114 | accessdate=19 February 2007}}</ref>

Between 1849 and 1870, five large stone buildings were erected by [[George M<U+00FC>ller]] to care for 2,050 orphans in his [[New Orphan Houses, Ashley Down, Bristol|Ashley Down orphanage]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ashley George Muller's Orphanage|url=http://www.about-bristol.co.uk/ash-01.asp|publisher=About Bristol|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>

[[Cabot Tower (Bristol)|Cabot Tower]] is situated in a public park on Brandon Hill. It was built in 1897 by [[William Venn Gough]] in memory of [[John Cabot]], 400&nbsp;years after he set sail from Bristol and landed on what is now [[Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Cabot Tower  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=378976 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref>

===Industrial===
[[Image:uk bristol granary.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bristol Byzantine|Byzantine style Granary]].]]
[[Image:Clifton.bridge.longview.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Clifton Suspension Bridge]].]]

A notable feature of Bristol's architecture is the [[Bristol Byzantine]] style.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Bristol Byzantine  | work=Looking at Buildings | url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927234936/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 | archivedate=27 September 2007 | accessdate=18 May 2007}}</ref>  Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style was used in the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the [[Victorian era]].  Surviving examples include the [[Colston Hall]],<ref>{{Cite web| title=The Colston Hall  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379355 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref> the [[Granary, Bristol|Granary on Welsh Back]], and the [[Carriage Works, Bristol|Gloucester Road Carriage Works]],<ref>{{Cite web| title=No.104 The Carriage Works  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380632 | accessdate=2 May 2007}}</ref> along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the [[Arnolfini]], which now houses an art gallery.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Bush House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380204 | accessdate=18 August 2006}}</ref> [[Clarks Wood Company warehouse]],<ref>{{Cite web| title= Clarks Wood Company warehouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380529 | accessdate=15 May 2007}}</ref> the [[St Vincent's Works]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=St Vincent's Works and attached front area railings | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380525 | accessdate=2 May 2007}}</ref> in Silverthorne Lane, and the [[Wool Hall, Bristol|Wool Hall]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=No.12 The Wool Hall, including the Fleece and Firkin Public House| work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380514 | accessdate=12 May 2007}}</ref> in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.

The local [[Sandstone|Pennant sandstone]] is frequently used as walling material, often with limestone dressings, as found on the old [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Temple Meads railway station]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Temple Meads Station | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380663 | accessdate=16 March 2007}}</ref> and [[Clifton Down railway station]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Clifton Down Station, Steam Tavern Public House and attached screen walls | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380884 | accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> Pennant sandstone is also used as large rock-faced squared blocks, described as ''Pennant rubble'', which are used alone, eked out with plain brickwork, or incorporated into the more rugged examples of Bristol Byzantine. Much of the local transport infrastructure including the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] and the original Temple Meads railway station<U+2014>now used as the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]]<U+2014>were designed or built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=Bristol Old Station, Temple Meads  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380662 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref>

In 1864, after over 100&nbsp;years of planning, the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Clifton Suspension Bridge | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379208 | accessdate=9 May 2006}}</ref> over the [[Avon Gorge]] linked the city to the [[Ashton Court]] estate. However, development to the west of the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] remained limited.

[[Former Everard's Printing Works|Edward Everard's printing works]] with its detailed ceramic frontage  was constructed in 1900.

==20th century==
[[Image:Wills Memorial Building from road during day.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wills Memorial Building]].]]
In the early part of the 20th century further expansion took place in residential districts increasingly distant from the city centre. [[Bristol Hippodrome]] was designed by [[Frank Matcham]], and opened on 16 December 1912.<ref>{{Cite web| title=The Hippodrome | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380406 | accessdate=21 March 2007}}</ref>

The [[Wills Memorial Building]] was commissioned in 1912 by [[George Alfred Wills]] and [[Henry Herbert Wills]], the magnates of the Bristol tobacco company [[W. D. & H. O. Wills]], in honour of their father, [[Henry Overton Wills III]], benefactor and first Chancellor of the [[University of Bristol]]. [[Sir George Oatley]] was chosen as architect and told to "build to last". He produced a design in the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular Gothic]] style, to evoke the famous university buildings of [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2003/257|title=New Chapter for the Wills Memorial Building|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=18 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/romanticstudies/events/willsbuilding.html|title=Wills Memorial Building|publisher=University of Bristol, Centre for Romantic Studies|accessdate=18 March 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060627041332/http://www.bris.ac.uk/romanticstudies/events/willsbuilding.html| archivedate = 27 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=University Tower and Wills Memorial Building and attached front walls and lamps | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380278 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref> The university also took over several existing houses such as [[Royal Fort]],<ref name = "Fort_Steps"/>  [[Victoria Rooms (Bristol)|Victoria Rooms]],<ref name = "Victoria_Rooms"/> [[Clifton Hill House]],<ref>{{Cite web| title= Clifton Hill House and attached front walls | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379238 | accessdate=14 March 2007}}</ref> [[Goldney Hall]],<ref name = "Goldney_House"/> [[Wills Hall]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Wills Hall  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380142 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}</ref> and buildings on [[Berkeley Square, Bristol|Berkeley Square]],<ref>{{Cite web| title=Nos.1<U+2013>8 (Consecutive) and attached railings and gates | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=378956 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title= Nos.11<U+2013>19 (Consecutive) and attached railings | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=378958 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=Nos.20<U+2013>30 (Consecutive) and attached railings and gates | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=378959 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref> [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] and the surrounding areas. Oatley was also involved in the design or restoration of other buildings in Bristol in the early part of the 20th century, including the  restoration of [[John Wesley]]'s original [[Methodist]] chapel, the [[New Room, Bristol|New Room]].<ref>{{Cite web| title=64.The New Room, Bristol | work=Methodist Conference | url=http://www.methodistconference.org.uk/Conf06_New_Room_Bristol.doc | accessdate=31 March 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009054106/http://www.methodistconference.org.uk/Conf06_New_Room_Bristol.doc| archivedate = 9 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=Wesley's New Room | work=Looking at Buildings from the Pevsner Architectural Guides | url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.2,5 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927235114/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.2,5 | archivedate=27 September 2007 | accessdate=31 March 2007}}</ref>

The 1930s saw the construction of the [[Employment Exchange, Bristol|Employment Exchange]] and the planning of the new [[Council House, Bristol|Council House]], although this was not completed until 1956.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Council House and attached railings and piers | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379313 | accessdate=21 August 2006}}</ref> As a centre of aircraft manufacturing, Bristol was a target for bombing during the [[Bristol Blitz]] of  World War II.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Overview | work=Bristol Blitzed | url=http://www.bristolblitzed.org/?page_id=5 | accessdate=7 March 2007}}</ref> Bristol's city centre suffered severe damage, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070322080553/http://weldgen.tripod.com/bristol-history/id6.html Pictoral history of Bristol], bristolhistory.com. Retrieved 14 April 2006.</ref> The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is now a [[Castle Park, Bristol|park]] featuring two bombed-out churches and fragments of the castle. A third bombed church has been given a new lease of life as the [[St Nicholas, Bristol|St Nicholas' Church Museum]]. Slightly to the north, the [[Broadmead]] shopping centre was built over bomb-damaged areas. [[Clifton Cathedral]], to the north of the city centre, was built during the early 1970s.

Like much of British post-war development, the regeneration of [[Bristol city centre]] was characterised by large cheap [[tower blocks]] such as [[Castlemead]], [[brutalist architecture]], and road expansion. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing, with the closure of main roads and the redevelopment of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006, two of the city centre's tallest post-war blocks were demolished. The transfer of the docks to [[Avonmouth]], <span style="white-space:nowrap">7&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(11&nbsp;km)</span> downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour). The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy, as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use.

In the 1990s, a harbourside concert hall designed by architects [[G<U+00FC>nter Behnisch|Behnisch & Partners]] was planned, but an [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] decision cut the funding and the project has not been revived.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blundell Jones |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |month=December |title=Harbour master&nbsp;<U+2014> design and construction of a concert hall in Bristol, England |journal=The architectural review |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1222_204/ai_54036016/pg_1 |accessdate=16 July 2007 |quote= }}</ref> This has left [[At-Bristol]], which mixes art, science and nature, with its all-reflective planetarium, as the centrepiece of the Harbourside development.<ref>[http://www.ivebeenthere.co.uk/places/united-kingdom/bristol/tips/architecture Bristol / architecture ], Guardian Unlimited.

[[Image:CabotCircus.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cabot Circus]] shopping centre, opened in 2008.]]
As of 2007, the Broadmead shopping centre is being redeveloped, and the city centre's tallest post-war blocks, including [[Tollgate House]] were demolished.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4608986.stm |title=Demolition of city tower begins |accessdate=10 March 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date= 13 January 2006}}</ref> The [[Former Bristol and West Building|former Bristol and West Tower]] was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding.  In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol, and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing urban landscape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Environment-Planning/Planning/planning-policy-documents/height-matters/height-matters.en |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930020105/http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Environment-Planning/Planning/planning-policy-documents/height-matters/height-matters.en |archivedate=30 September 2007 |title=Height Matters&nbsp;<U+2014> Consultation on tall buildings in Bristol |accessdate=15 July 2007 |work=Bristol City Council}}</ref>
