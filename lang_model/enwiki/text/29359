'''Bloody Run''' is a [[tributary]] of [[West Branch Fishing Creek]] in [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania]], in the United States. It is approximately {{convert|2.9|mi|km}} long and flows through [[Davidson Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Davidson Township]].<ref name = "nationalmap">{{Citation|author = [[United States Geological Survey]]|url = http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/|title = The National Map Viewer|accessdate = December 29, 2014}}</ref> The watershed of the stream has an area of {{convert|1.30|sqmi|km2}}. Various glacial tills and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale are found in the vicinity of the stream. The stream is designated for use by aquatic life and is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery. 

==Course==
Bloody Run begins in a valley on a [[plateau]] in Davidson Township. It flows south-southeast for a short distance before turning south-southwest. The stream then turns east-southeast for a few tenths of a mile and its valley deepens. It turns south-southeast and then south for approximately two miles (three kilometers) and its valley continues to deepen. The stream then leaves its valley and turns east-southeast for a few tenths of a mile, in the valley of West Branch Fishing Creek. It then reaches its confluence with West Branch Fishing Creek.<ref name = "nationalmap"/>

Bloody Run joins West Branch Fishing Creek {{convert|4.36|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth.<ref name = "gaz">{{Citation|url = http://www.lycoming.edu/cwi/pdfs/paGazetterOfStreams.pdf|title = Pennsylvania Gazetteer of Streams|date = November 2, 2001|accessdate = December 29, 2014}}</ref>

A [[glacial till]] known as the Wisconsinan Bouldery Till can be found in the lower reaches of Bloody Run and in its valley. The stream's upper reaches are in the vicinity of a glacial till known as the Wisconsinan Till. In the stream's middle reaches and on the edges of its valley, there is [[bedrock]] consisting of [[shale]] and [[sandstone]].<ref>{{Citation|author = Duane D.
