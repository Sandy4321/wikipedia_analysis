'''The Reverend Samson Occom''' (also spelled ''Occum'') ([[1723]] &ndash; [[1792]]) was a member of the [[Mohegan]] nation near [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Connecticut]], born to Joshua Tomacham and Sarah, believed to be a direct descendant of the famous Mohegan chief, [[Uncas]]. 

In [[1740]], at the age of sixteen, he was exposed to the teachings of Christian evangelical preachers in the [[Great Awakening]]. He began to study theology at the "Lattin School" of [[Eleazar Wheelock]] in [[1743]] and stayed with him for four years until leaving to begin his own career. He served as a missionary to Native American people in [[New England]] and [[Montauk]], Long Island where he married a local woman. It was also on Long Island where he was officially ordained a [[Presbyterian]] minister on [[August 30]], [[1759]] by the presbytery of Suffolk. Although promised otherwise by the church leaders, Occom was never paid the same salary as white preachers, and he lived in deep poverty for much of his life. 

Wheelock established an Indian charity school with a benefaction from Joshua Moor in 1754, and he persuaded Occom to go to [[England]] in [[1766]] to raise money for the school, along with the Rev. Nathaniel Whitaker. Occom preached his way across the country from [[February 16]], [[1766]], to [[July 22]], [[1767]]. He delivered in total between three and four hundred sermons, drawing large crowds wherever he went. By the end of his tour he had raised over twelve thousand pounds for Wheelock's project. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] himself donated 200 pounds, and [[William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth]] subscribed 50 guineas. The friendship between Occom and Wheelock dissolved when Occom learned that Wheelock had neglected to care for Occom's wife and children while he was away. Occom also took issue with the fact that Wheelock put the funds toward establishing [[Dartmouth College]] for the education of Englishmen rather than of Native Americans.

Upon his return from [[England]], Occom lived at [[Mohegan]], then moved in [[1786]] with some [[New England]] and [[Long Island]] Indians to [[Oneida]] territory in what is known today as [[New York]]. He then helped to found Brothertown, and  lived among the [[Brothertown Indians]]. Later Stockbridge (Mohicans) people moved to the area. In [[1768]], Occom wrote the 10-page ''A Short Narrative of My Life'', which was kept in [[Dartmouth College]]'s archive collection until publication in 1982. He also published ''Sermon at the Execution of Moses Paul'' and ''A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs'' in [[1774]]. He was the first Native American person to ever publish documents in English.

He died on [[July 14]], [[1792]] in [[New Stockbridge, New York]]. He is buried just off of Bogusville Road outside of Deansboro (formerly known as Brothertown), New York.

In the first half of the 1800's many [[Brothertown Indians]] people moved to what is now known as the [[Brothertown, Calumet County, Wisconsin|Brothertown]] township in [[Calumet County]], [[Wisconsin]]. The [[Brothertown Indians]] are currently petitioning the federal government to be [[Native Americans in the United States|federally recognized]] - in effect, re-recognized. Federal recognition was initially stripped from the Brothertown people when they accepted US citizenship in an effort to avoid being displaced yet again. Since then, US policy has changed and Native American people are, quite obviously, both American citizens - as well as citizens of their respective Nations. However the policy as implemented among the Brothertown Indians, the first Native Americans granted US citizenship, at the time stripped them of what we today call [[tribal sovereignty]].
