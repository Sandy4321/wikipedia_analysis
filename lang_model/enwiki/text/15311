The '''J.T. Murphy No. 1 Crater''' is the site of a historic oil-drilling accident near [[Norphlet, Arkansas|Norphlet]], [[Union County, Arkansas]].  The site is located about {{convert|3|mi|km}} north and west of Norphlet, off Firetower Road about 3/4 mile (1.21 km) north of its junction with Baugh Street.  On May 14, 1922, an oil drilling crew completed a {{convert|2000|ft|m}} well, dubbed J.T. Murphy No. 1, and began pumping.  The early production was entirely [[natural gas]], which began escaping from the drill collar.  Eventually it caught fire, burning for several hours, and destroying the derrick.  It also caused a series of violent underground explosions.  This resulted in the creation of a crater {{convert|450|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|50|ft|m}} deep, along with a number of other, shallower, craters.  The land, which had previously been in cotton production, was abandoned, and has gradually returned to forest.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0349.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for J.T.

The site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2008.<ref name="nris"/>
