The '''Saint Lawrence River''' (In [[French language|French]]: '' fleuve Saint-Laurent''; '''Kahnaw<U+00E1><U+02C0>kye'''<ref>Rudes, B. ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999</ref> in [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]], '''Kaniatarowanenneh''' ("big waterway") in [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]]) is a large [[river]] flowing approximately from southwest to northeast in the middle latitudes of [[North America]], connecting the [[Great Lakes]] with the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is the primary drainage of the [[Great Lakes Basin]]. It traverses the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] and forms part of the [[Canada-United States border|international boundary]] between Ontario, Canada, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. 

==Geography== 

The Saint Lawrence River originates at the outflow of [[Lake Ontario]] between [[Kingston, Ontario]] on the north bank, [[Wolfe Island]] in mid-stream, and [[Cape Vincent, New York]] on the south bank.

From there, it passes [[Gananoque, Ontario|Gananoque]], [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]], [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]], [[Massena, New York|Massena]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res]], and [[Quebec City]] before draining into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the largest [[estuary]] in the world. It runs 3,058&nbsp;kilometres (1,900&nbsp;mi) from the furthest headwater to the mouth (1,197&nbsp;kilometres or 744&nbsp;mi from the outflow of Lake Ontario). The furthest headwater is the [[North River (Minnesota)|North River]] in the [[Mesabi Range]] at [[Hibbing]], [[Minnesota]]. Its drainage area, which  includes the Great Lakes and hence the world's largest system of fresh water lakes, has a size of 1.03&nbsp;million [[Square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (390,000&nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). The average discharge at the mouth is 10,400&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m<U+00B3>]]/[[second|s]] (367,000&nbsp;[[Cubic foot|cu&nbsp;ft]]/s).

The river includes [[Lake Saint-Louis]] south of Montreal, [[Lac Saint-Fran<U+00E7>ois]] at [[Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec|Salaberry-de-Valleyfield]] and [[Lac Saint-Pierre]] east of Montreal. It encompasses three [[archipelago]]es:  the [[Thousand Islands]] chain near [[Kingston, Ontario]]; the [[Hochelaga Archipelago]], including the [[Island of Montreal]] and [[<U+00CE>le J<U+00E9>sus]] ([[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]); and the smaller [[Mingan Archipelago]]. Other islands include [[<U+00CE>le d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]] near Qu<U+00E9>bec City, and [[Anticosti Island]] north of the [[Gasp<U+00E9>]].

[[Lake Champlain]] and the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]], [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]], and [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]] rivers drain into the St. Lawrence.

The Saint Lawrence River is in a seismically active zone where [[fault (geology)|fault]] reactivation is believed to occur along late [[Proterozoic]] to early [[Paleozoic]] normal faults related to the opening of [[Iapetus Ocean]]. The faults in the area are [[rift]] related, which is called the [[Saint Lawrence rift system]].

The Saint Lawrence Valley is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic province]] of the larger [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] division, containing the [[Champlain Valley|Champlain]] and Northern physiographic section.<ref name="USGS-Water">{{cite web | title = Physiographic divisions of the conterminous U.

==History==
The St. Lawrence estuary was visited by many navigators (such as [[John Cabot]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]]) and Basque fishermen soon after the discovery of America (or perhaps even before, see [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact#Late contact claims]]). But the first known European explorer to sail the inland part of the St. Lawrence was [[Jacques Cartier]], during his second trip to Canada in 1535, with the help of Iroquoian chief Donnacona's two sons. As he arrived in the estuary on [[St. Lawrence]]' feast day, Cartier accordingly named it the '''Gulf of St. Lawrence'''.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21543/ William Henry Johnson, ''French Pathfinders in North America'' (Project Gutenberg)]</ref>  The land along the river was inhabited at the time by the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]]. 

[[Image:Dauphin Map of Canada - circa 1543 - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of 1543 showing Cartier's discoveries.]]
Until the early 1600s, the French used the name ''Rivi<U+00E8>re du Canada'' to designate the Saint Lawrence upstream to Montreal and the Ottawa River after Montreal. The Saint Lawrence River served as the main route for European exploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]].

The St. Lawrence was formerly continuously navigable only as far as Montreal because of the virtually impassible [[Lachine Rapids]]. The [[Lachine Canal]] was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids; the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], an extensive system of canals and locks, now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the way to [[Lake Superior]].  The Seaway was officially opened on 26 June 1959 by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (representing Canada) and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (representing the United States of America).

In the late 1970s, the river was the subject of a successful ecological campaign (called "Save the River"), originally responding to planned development by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].  The campaign was organized, among others, by [[Abbie Hoffman]], then on the run under the pseudonym of Barry Freed.

Occasionally, the French name '''''fleuve Saint-Laurent''''' is wrongly translated as Saint Lawrence seaway since it uses the word ''fleuve'' and not ''rivi<U+00E8>re''. However, the word ''fleuve'' means a large river, which runs to the ocean or sea. There is no word in English that distinguishes this type of a river from others, and thus is appropriately translated by ''river''. The seaway is a system of artificial canals and is called in French ''la voie maritime du Saint-Laurent''.

The source of the North River in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota is considered to be the source of the Saint Lawrence River. Because it crosses so many lakes, the water system frequently changes its name. From source to mouth, the names are:

* [[North River (Minnesota)|North River]]
* [[Saint Louis River]]
* [[Lake Superior]]
* [[St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)|Saint Marys River]]
* [[Lake Huron]]
* [[St. Clair River|Saint Clair River]]
* [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake Saint Clair]]
* [[Detroit River]]
* [[Lake Erie]]
* [[Niagara River]]
* [[Lake Ontario]]
* Saint Lawrence River

==Literature==
The St. Lawrence River is at the heart of many Quebec novels ([[Anne H<U+00E9>bert]]'s [[Kamouraska (novel)|Kamouraska]], [[R<U+00E9>jean Ducharme]]'s [[L'aval<U+00E9>e des aval<U+00E9>s]]), poems (in works of [[Pierre Morency]], [[Bernard Pozier]]), and songs ([[Leonard Cohen]]'s ''[[Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)|Suzanne]]'', Michel Rivard's ''L'oubli''). The river has also been portrayed in paintings, notably by the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. In addition, the river is the namesake of [[Saint-Laurent Herald]] at the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].
