The '''2010 United States midterm elections''' will be held on Tuesday, November 2, 2010. All 435 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and 37 of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]] will be contested in this election along with 38 state and territorial [[Governor#United States|governorships]], many <!-- Most definitely NOT 50 -->[[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], four territorial legislatures and numerous state and local races. 

The GOP lost heavily in the 2006 and 2008 elections, giving up Congress and the White House.  Congressional Republicans were almost unanimous in opposing the key elements of the Obama administration domestic policy in 2009-2010, while generally supporting its foreign policy in Afghanistan and Iraq. With the economy continuing to falter, support for Obama and the Democrats has suffered significantly. Political analysts in October 2010 predict sweeping Republican gains in the 2010 midterm elections, pointing to the swing that would be generated on current polling, and an "enthusiasm gap" that measures Republican voters to be significantly more engaged than Democratic voters.<ref>See [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303550904575562493014465942.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsTop Jonathan Weisman, "GOP in Lead in Final Lap," ''Wall Street Journal'' Oct 20, 2010]</ref> 

The election was contested against a background poor to mediocre economic news, as the national growth rate was anemic and unemployment hovered just below 10%.  The issues emphasized by the candidates and voters focused on economic malaise, the financial policies of the Obama Administration, especially regarding bailouts, health care, taxes, and deficits, as well as corruption in government and the role of "fat cats" in getting bailouts, and secretly funding the election itself.

==Issues==
{{expand section|date=October 2010}}
The issues highlighted by the candidates and voters in 2010 focus on national economic conditions and the economic policies of the Obama Administration, especially regarding bailouts, health care, taxes, and deficits, as well as corruption in government and terrorism.<ref>Jeffrey M. Jones, "Americans Give GOP Edge on Most Election Issues; Greatest Republican advantages on terrorism, immigration, federal spending," [http://www.gallup.com/poll/142730/americans-give-gop-edge-election-issues.aspx ''Gallup,'' Sept. 1, 2010]</ref>  Voters have paid relatively little attention to foreign affairs or the environment. Political analyst [[Dick Morris]] has argued that in a "fundamental change" evangelical or social issues do not dominate the Republican activists in 2010, because "economic and fiscal issues prevail. The [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] has made the Republican Party safe for libertarians."<ref>Dick Morris, [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/10/20/the_new_republican_right_107653.html "The New Republican Right," ''TheHill.com'' October 19, 2010]</ref> 

Immigration reform has become an important issue, particularly with observers outside the United States<ref>http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/10/2010102663339536685.html</ref> following [[Arizona SB 1070]].

President Obama in his campaigning denounced the secret corporate funding of the election, which was permitted by the Supreme Court [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|"Citizens United"]] decision in January, 2010.<ref>Greg Sargant, "Axelrod: We'll keep pounding outside spending and foreign money,"  [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/10/axelrod_well_keep_pounding_out.html ''Washington Post'' Oct. 12, 2010]</ref>
