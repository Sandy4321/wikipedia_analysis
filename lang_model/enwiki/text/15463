'''''Marplesornis novaezealandiae''''', also referred to as '''Harris<U+2019> Penguin''' is a [[genus]] and [[species]] of [[extinction|extinct]] [[penguin]] from New Zealand. It was a relatively large penguin, about the same size as a [[King Penguin]].

==History==
The penguin was [[scientific description|described]] by Brian Marples from [[fossil]] material (a fairly complete skeleton) collected by G. Harris from Motunau Beach in the [[Canterbury Region]] of the [[South Island]]. Although the exact age is uncertain because of the complex geology of the collection site, it is probably [[Late Pliocene]] (about three million years old). Marples placed it in ''Paleospheniscus'', a genus known from Argentina. It was subsequently moved by [[George Gaylord Simpson]] to the new, [[monotypic taxon|montypic]] genus ''Marplesornis'', named to honour the original describer. The specific [[epithet]] is a [[Latinisation of names|latinisation]] of <U+201C>New Zealand<U+201D>. The common name recognises the discoverer of the [[Type (biology)|type material]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson, G.G. |year=1972 |title= Pliocene penguins from North Canterbury, New Zealand |journal= Records of the Canterbury Museum |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=159<U+2013>182|url= |doi= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Checklist of the Birds of New Zealand, Norfolk and Macquarie Islands, and the Ross Dependency, Antarctica |author=Gill, B.J.
