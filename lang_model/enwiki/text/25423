The '''Gomaco Trolley Company''' is a manufacturer of vintage-style [[tram|streetcars]] (alternatively called ''trolleys'' in the USA, or ''trams'' in much of the world), located in [[Ida Grove, Iowa|Ida Grove]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]].  The company has supplied replica-vintage streetcars to several transit systems in the USA, and has also restored and rebuilt authentic vintage streetcars for some systems.

==History==

Established in 1982, Gomaco Trolley Company is a division of Gomaco Corporation, a major builder of equipment used in concrete paving.  Founded in 1965 by Harold Godbersen,<ref>{{cite web| title = All about Ida Grove| publisher = City of Ida Grove | url = http://www.idagroveia.com/Resources/pages/aboutig_attractions.html | accessdate = May 31, 2009 }}</ref> the parent company's name, "Gomaco", is a contraction of the words Godbersen Manufacturing Company.<ref name="TNERJ92">{{cite journal | last = Morgan | first = Steve | title = Portland's New/Old Trolleys | journal = The New Electric Railway Journal | publisher = Free Congress Foundation | date = Spring 1992 | url = http://heritagetrolley.com/TNERJPortland.htm  | issn = 1048-3845 |accessdate = May 31, 2009 }}</ref>

Gomaco Corporation first branched out into the field of trolley manufacturing in 1982, when it was the successful bidder on a contract to supply two reproductions of "turn-of-the-century"-era trolleys/streetcars for operation on a new line due to be built at the [[Lowell National Historical Park]], in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].<ref name="TY84">Saitta, Joseph P.

Brill and Company]] for the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway.<ref name="Siouxcity"/> The construction was all-new, except for their [[bogie|truck]]s, which Gomaco obtained from retired [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] streetcars and refurbished and adapted for use with the cars it was building for Lowell. These first two Gomaco streetcars were delivered in 1983/84. The Lowell streetcar line opened in May 1984, and was well-received, leading to the historical park's placing another order with Gomaco later, for one enclosed car of similar faux-vintage style, which was delivered in 1987 (car 4131).<ref name="Young">Young, Andrew D.

In the mid-1980s, Gomaco built two more 15-bench, open-style cars.  Car 1976 was a conventional streetcar with a [[trolley pole]] on its roof, while car 1977 was fitted with an on-board generator, so that it could be operated on existing tracks, on a trial basis, without need for [[overhead lines|overhead trolley wire]]s.  The  two cars were demonstrators which the company loaned to a few different operators.  Ultimately, car 1977 was acquired by the [[Platte Valley Trolley]], in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], and&mdash;many years later&mdash;car 1976 by [[Hillsborough Area Regional Transit|HART]] for the 2002-opened [[TECO Line Streetcar System]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].

==Gradual expansion, new designs==
Subsequently, Gomaco Trolley Company has won contracts from other operators to build or rebuild vintage streetcars and, unlike with the Lowell line, Gomaco's later products have mostly been used by [[public transport|public transit]] agencies, for regular service along city streets.  In 1991-92, the company provided four streetcars to [[TriMet]], in [[Portland, Oregon]], for use on the [[Portland Vintage Trolley]] service, which began operation in late 1991. Similar to the "Lowell enclosed" model, these were replicas of 1904 [[J. G. Brill and Company|Brill]]-built, double-truck cars, patterned on streetcars that had been operated locally, in Portland.  However, in this instance the replicas would be sharing the tracks with modern [[light rail]] cars of TriMet's [[MAX Light Rail|MAX]] system, so while Gomaco based the new bodies on the 1904 cars, the trucks were a younger style (1940s/'50s) which the company assembled from parts it acquired from Boston streetcars and Chicago rapid-transit cars.<ref name="TNERJ92"/>  The four Portland cars (511-514) also were equipped with modern features such as [[Automatic train stop|Automatic Train Stop]].

During the mid- and late 1990s, Gomaco restored and rebuilt several ex-Melbourne [[W class Melbourne tram|W2-type streetcar]]s for [[Memphis|Memphis']] [[MATA Trolley|Main Street Trolley]] and also sold to the [[Memphis Area Transit Authority]] a single-truck car it had built all-new in 1993 as a demonstrator.<ref name="TNERJ96">{{cite journal | last = Wilkins | first = Van | title = Heritage Trolleys in Memphis and Galveston | journal = The New Electric Railway Journal | publisher = Free Congress Foundation | date = Spring 1996 | url = http://www.heritagetrolley.org/TNERJMemphGalv.htm | issn = 1048-3845|accessdate = May 31, 2009 }}</ref>

In more recent years, the company has supplied new replica [[Birney]] streetcars to the [[TECO Line Streetcar System]], in Tampa;  to the [[River Rail Streetcar]], in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]];<ref>{{cite journal | last = Harnack | first = Leah | title = Making More with Less | journal = Mass Transit magazine | publisher = Cygnus Publishing | date = July 2006 | url = http://www.masstransitmag.com/print/Mass-Transit/Making-More-With-Less/1$1217 | issn = 0364-3484 |accessdate = May 31, 2009 }}</ref> and to the [[Charlotte Area Transit System]], in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], for use on the [[Charlotte Trolley]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Charlotte, North Carolina, Debuts New Trolley Cars, October 16, 2004| publisher = Gomaco Trolley Company | url = http://www.gomacotrolley.com/resources/charlotteopening.html | accessdate = May 31, 2009 }}</ref>  These cars used trucks taken from 1920s-vintage [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt-type streetcar]]s which Gomaco acquired from [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and refurbished.<ref>{{cite web| title = APTA Streetcar and Heritage Trolley Site: Rolling Stock| publisher = [[American Public Transportation Association]] | url = http://www.heritagetrolley.com/planRollingStock.htm | accessdate = June 7, 2009 }}</ref>

Gomaco Trolley added a new model in 2002, with the introduction of the "reconditioned Peter Witt", which is the refurbishing of a complete [[Peter Witt streetcar]], rather than only using its trucks. A large number of Peter Witt streetcars remain in regular service in Milan in 2009, but operator [[Azienda Trasporti Milanesi|ATM]] has retired some in recent years, and Gomaco purchased a number of these cars from ATM, for possible reconditioning for customers in North America.

The company also takes orders from customers who only want a replica trolley body, not a complete and functioning car.  In 2006, it built a replica of half of a Peter Witt trolley car for decorative use as a cover to the entrance to an underground trolley station (of [[SEPTA]]) at the University of Pennsylvania campus in Philadelphia.  It was patterned exactly after the particular style of Peter Witt car that served Philadelphia&mdash;in large numbers&mdash;starting in the mid-1920s.<ref>{{cite web| title = 'Trolley' Subway Entrance - October 2006| publisher = Gomaco Trolley Company | url = http://www.gomacotrolley.com/Resources/philadelphia_oct2006.html | accessdate = June 7, 2009 }}</ref> The replica was a gift to the school from its Class of 1956.<ref>{{cite web| title = Class of 1956 Trolley / 37th & Spruce @ Woodland Avenue| publisher = [[University of Pennsylvania]] | url = http://www.facilities.upenn.edu/artHistory/56trolley.php3 | accessdate = June 7, 2009 }}</ref>

Gomaco has also built at least one battery-powered streetcar. In 2008, it delivered two open cars to [[Glendale, California|Glendale, California's]] [[Americana at Brand]] shopping development: one a 33-foot-long battery-powered car and the other a 22-foot-long unpowered passenger car (trailer).<ref>{{cite web| title = Glendale, California - 'Americana at Brand' Project| publisher = Gomaco Trolley Company | url = http://www.gomacotrolley.com/Resources/glendaleindex.html | accessdate = May 31, 2009 }}</ref>  The powered car is equipped with a wheelchair lift.<ref>{{cite web| title = Property Features| publisher = [[Americana at Brand|The Americana at Brand]] | url = http://www.americanaatbrand.com/features.html | accessdate = June 7, 2009 }}</ref>
