The '''Castle of Sig<U+00FC>enza''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Castillo de Sig<U+00FC>enza'') is located in [[Sig<U+00FC>enza]] in the [[Province of Guadalajara]] in central Spain.

==History==
The origins of the fortifications in Sig<U+00FC>enza go back to the [[Celtiberians]] who inhabited the right bank of the river in the final centuries B.C. The [[Visigoths]] built a small castle in the 5th century above the town. The Moors built a large fortified castle or [[alcazaba]] in the early 8th century to defend the area against the Christian kings of Leon and Castile. It was enclosed by a defensive wall providing an area known as the medina. In 1124, the castle was retaken by [[Bernard of Agen]] allowing Sim<U+00F3>n Gir<U+00F3>n de Cisnernos to build an episcopal palace there. In 1298, the castle was taken by the troops of [[Alfonso de la Cerda]] during the battle against [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]], the boy king, but was defended by the bishop's vassals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parador.es/sites/default/files/parador/adjuntos/2013/09/siguenza_eng.pdf|title=Sig<U+00FC>enza And Its Parador|publisher=Paradores|accessdate=26 September 2014 |language=}}</ref> In the 15th century, the castle was strengthened by the bishops to protect it from attacks from [[Aragon]] and [[Navarre]].<ref name=cs>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciudadsegontia.com/castle.htm|title=Its history, its legens and its curiosities|publisher=The Castle of Sig<U+00FC>enza|accessdate=25 September 2014 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

In the late 18th century, Bishop Juan D<U+00ED>az de la Guerra changed the appearance of the castle from a fortress into an episcopal palace with additional windows, balconies and stables. However, in 1808 during the [[War of Spanish Independence]] the castle was taken by the French who seriously damaged it and looted all its riches before it was recaptured by [[El Empecinado]]. The episcopal palace was further devastated by fire in the 1830s and had to be abandoned.<ref name=cs/>

In 1972, the Ministry of Tourism gave the castle the status of a [[parador]] or luxury hotel. Restoration of the building began in 1964 and was completed in 1976 by the architect Jos<U+00E9> Luis Picardo. The official inauguration took place in 1978 with the visit of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] and [[Queen Sof<U+00ED>a of Spain|Queen Sof<U+00ED>a]].<ref name=cs/> Decorated with banners and suits of armor, the huge lounge is the castle's original dining room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paradores-spain.com/spain/psiguenza.html|title=Parador Hotel Siguenza|publisher=ParaPromotions|accessdate=26 September 2014 |language=}}</ref>
