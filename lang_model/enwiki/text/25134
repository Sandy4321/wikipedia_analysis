The '''''Hav<U+00F8>rn'' Accident''' ({{lang-no|Hav<U+00F8>yn-ulykken}}) was a [[controlled flight into terrain]] of a [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft into the mountain [[Lihesten]] in [[Hyllestad]], [[Norway]] on 16 June 1936 at 07:00. The aircraft, operated by [[Norwegian Air Lines]], was en route from [[Bergen]] to [[Troms<U+00F8>]]. The pilots were unaware that they were flying a parallel to the planned course, {{convert|15|to|20|km|sp=us}} further east. The crew of four and three passengers were all killed in what was the first fatal aviation accident in Norway. The aircraft landed on a shelf on the mountain face. A first expedition found four bodies, but attempts to reach the shelf with the main part of the aircraft and three more bodies failed. A second party was sent out two days later, coordinated by [[Bernt Balchen]] and led by [[Boye Schlytter]] and [[Henning T<U+00F8>nsberg]], saw the successful salvage of the remaining bodies.

==Accident==
The air service between Bergen and Troms<U+00F8> was started by Norwegian Air Lines on 7 June 1936.<ref name=n84>Nordstrand (2006): 84</ref> It was operated with ''Hav<U+00F8>rn'', a Junkers Ju 52, [[aircraft registration|registration]] LN-DAE, which had been bought from [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-f.kommune.no/sff/sffarkiv3.nsf/f53794c3ef3981f0c1256f230030646e/2e52ba010df23726c125766a00426524!OpenDocument |title="Hav<U+00F8>rn"-ulukka i Hyllestad |publisher=[[Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality]] |date=6 June 2008 |last=Kleppa |first=Hermund |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 July 2011 |archivedate=17 July 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zW9SQCF6}}</ref> On 16 June 1936 at 06:30 [[Central European Time]], the flight departed from the water aerodrome in [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]], Bergen. On board was a crew of four and three passengers,<ref name=n83>Nordstrand (2006): 83</ref> and a load of 13 bags of {{convert|50|kg}} of post.<ref name=n86>Nordstrand (2006): 86</ref>

The aircraft's [[captain (airlines)|captain]] was Ditlev Pentz Smith. Aged 27, he had started flying for the [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] in 1930, and later become a civilian pilot for [[Wider<U+00F8>e]]. He was considered one of the country's most renowned pilots and was active with competition flights. He was assisted by [[First Officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]] Erik Storm, aged 32, who had a background from the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]].<ref name=n94>Nordstrand (2006): 94</ref> The reserve pilot was Peter Ruth Paasche, aged 21, and the [[radio operator]] was Per Erling Hegle, aged 28 and a trained mechanic.<ref name=n95>Nordstrand (2006): 95</ref> All four had been chosen to regularly fly the Bergen<U+2013>Troms<U+00F8> route.<ref name=n94 /><ref name=n95 /> The three passengers were Inspector Sven Svensen L<U+00F8>git, Consul Wilhelm Andreas Mejdell Dall<ref>Nordstrand (2006): 96</ref> and journalist Harald Wigum of ''[[Bergens Tidende]]''.<ref>Nordstrand (2006): 97</ref>

The weather report, which had been delivered orally by meteorologist-on-duty of the [[Forecasting Division of Western Norway]] at the airport,<ref name=n88>Nordstrand (2006): 88</ref> stated wind from southeast at {{convert|5|to|15|km/h|sp=us|0}}, overcast and clouds down to {{convert|200|m|sp=us|-2}}, although it could be even lower certain places. The visibility was {{convert|4|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=n83 /> The last radio contact between the aircraft and the airport in Bergen was at 06:54, when Hegle reported clouds at {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|sp=us|-3}} elevation and between {{convert|4|and|10|km|sp=us|-0}} visibility. He reported that the  aircraft held a course towards Krakhellesundet, which was procedure during such weather conditions, and that the aircraft was south of [[Sognesj<U+00F8>en]].<ref name=n84 />

However, the aircraft was not where the pilots thought it was<U+2014>instead it was {{convert|15|to|20|km|sp=us}} further east.<ref name=n88>Nordstrand (2006): 88</ref> Eyewitnesses reported that after it had crossed [[Sognefjorden]], it had changed course westward and started to ascend. At 07:00, a loud crash was heard, although there were no eyewitnesses to the crash itself. The aircraft had followed a parallel, but more eastern, course and had hit Lihesten, a mountain rising up from Lifjorden, at {{convert|600|m|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref name=n84 /> The aircraft caught fire and was highly visible from the surrounding area. Parts of the aircraft fell to the foot of the mountain, and the wreckage was scattered across the base of the mountain.<ref name=n85>Nordstrand (2006): 85</ref> The [[controlled flight into terrain]] was the first fatal aviation accident in Norway.<ref name=n83 />

==Salvage and investigation==
[[File:Lifjellet Hyllestad.jpg|thumb|Lihesten, the location of the accident]]
Several locals rushed to the foot of the mountain, and at 08:30, Sheriff Kaare Bredvik arrived at the scene. Two corpses were found immediately, but were so scorched that they could not be identified until at hospital.<ref name=n85 /> There were rumors of survivors as movement had been spotted on the mountain side. Bredvik had difficulty communicating with his superiors in Sogn Police District, and had to contact them via Bergen. From there, the press was also alerted, and several locals became ''ad hoc'' correspondents. The home of Deputy Mayor Hans A. Risnes was used as a base of operations. However, searching was made difficult by the lack of any radio connection at the foot of the hill. Eventually a "shouting relay" was created, allowing messages to be sent effectively. A party of experienced mountaineers, who had many times succeeded at getting sheep down from shelves, attempted to reach the wreck, which was located on a shelf {{convert|100|m|sp=us|-2}} above the foot. Despite three attempts the first day, they did not succeed at reaching the aircraft.<ref name=n86 />

Chief of Police Alf Reksten arrived in the afternoon and took over responsibility. Later, the ship ''Mira'', belonging to [[Bergen Steamship Company]] (BSD), arrived with two doctors, two nurses, material from the [[Red Cross]], specialist police officers, fire fighters, representatives from the airline and [[Norway Post]], and journalists.<ref name=n86 /> The sister aircraft ''Najaden'' arrived later in the afternoon with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Wider<U+00F8>e aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.<ref name=n87>Nordstrand (2006): 87</ref>

[[File:Bernt Balchen.jpg|thumb|left|The salvage and investigation was led by [[Bernt Balchen]]]]
After Balchen had investigated the accident site from the plane, a party of five climbers started at 18:00 to climb the mountain side. When they reached the shelf, they found two bodies, a large amount of post and parts from the plane, including a wing. The bodies were sent down the mountain side. They then attempted to climb further up to the main wreck where the last three bodies were presumed to be, but this was deemed too dangerous by Balchen, and the operation terminated. ''Mira'' returned to Bergen at 02:00.<ref name=n87 /> The following day, four people attempted to climb down the mountain face to reach the wreck. Magnus Nipen was lowered {{convert|50|m|sp=us}}, but it was impossible to descend the remaining {{convert|70|to|80|m|sp=us}}. Balchen concluded that it was impossible to reach the aircraft, and returned to Oslo the same afternoon.<ref name=n88 />

However, the locals were determined to reach the aircraft. Magnus Kolgrov, along with Robert and Bernt Porten, who along with two others descended down a further {{convert|30|m|sp=us|-2}}. Although they were able to salvage two post bags, they were not able to reach the wreck.<ref name=n88 /> The operation took ten hours. From then, the police stationed an officer at the top of the mountain, both to hinder theft and to enforce a climbing ban.<ref name=n89>Nordstrand (2006): 89</ref>

In a [[letter to the editor]] in ''[[Aftenposten]]'' on 17 June, submitted by Robert M. Steen, it was suggested that reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association [[Norsk Tindeklub]].<ref>{{cite news|title=En opgave for Norsk Tindeklub|date=17 June 1936|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=5|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The newspaper contacted the club,<ref name=n89 /> and offered to cover all expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning T<U+00F8>nsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel ''Vulcanus''. [[Arne N<U+00E6>ss, Jr.]] had just used [[bolt (climbing)|bolts]] to climb the [[Dolomites]], and these had been lent to T<U+00F8>nsberg. As such, it was the first time bolts were used for climbing in Norway.<ref name=n90>Nordstrand (2006): 90</ref>

They started the ascent at 19:00 and reached the first shelf about two hours later. Here, a field radio was stationed. Later the same evening, they reached the main shelf where the aircraft body lay.<ref name=n90 /> Although finding the remaining bodies, the team only salvaged some post, concluding that it would be too difficult for them to take down the bodies. The were down again at 01:30. At 10:00 on 20 June, the team again ascended the mountain. Bernt Porten climbed half-way up at least a dozen times, taking water up and bringing down bodies wrapped in tarpaulin. All three bodies and the climbers were down again at 21:00.<ref>Nordstrand (2006): 91</ref>

==Aftermath==
The airline offered compensation to the locals, but this was rejected in a letter date 27 June, in which the locals collectively stated that they were just happy to help.<ref name=p92>Nordstrand (2006): 92</ref> In a [[Norwegian Council of State|Council of State]] on 21 August, Schlytter, T<U+00F8>nsberg, Robert Porten and Heggenes were awarded the [[Medal for Heroic Deeds]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lifjell-heltene bel<U+00F8>nnet med medaljen for edel d<U+00E5>d|date=21 August 1936|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=1|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The medals were presented in a ceremony at [[Hotel Continental, Oslo]] some days later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Redningsmannskapet i Lifjell hedres|date=23 August 1936|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=2|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In early 1937, news surfaced that the widow and father of Erik Storm filed a lawsuit against the Norwegian Air Lines. The father, Major B. Storm, stated that his goal was "rehabilitation of my son as well as compensation".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken for retten?|date=3 February 1937|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=1|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The family had received {{NOK|45,000|lk=yes}} of insurance money, but reportedly wanted more, and also desired to have the airline take the responsibility for the accident.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken skal for retten|date=22 April 1937|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=1|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The family sent a formal petition to the [[Parliament of Norway]] asking for further accident investigation,<ref>{{cite news|title=Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken innbringes for Stortinget|date=11 February 1937|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=1|language=Norwegian}}</ref> but after acquiring statements from the Chief of Police of Sogn and the [[Riksadvokaten]] and cycling the case through [[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]], the Parliament declared that no action should be taken.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ingen ny unders<U+00F8>kelseskommisjon i forbindelse med Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken|date=24 April 1937|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=3|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken|date=28 May 1937|work=[[Aftenposten]]|page=7|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In addition, the lawsuit was dropped, after the airline reached an "agreement" with Storm's family, and had a letter publicly printed in which Storm was cleared of all responsibility for the accident.<ref>{{cite news|title=S<U+00F8>ksm<U+00E5>let mot D.N.L. i forbindelse med Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken bortfaller|date=11 February 1938|work=[[Aftenposten]]|page=3|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hav<U+00F8>rn-ulykken|date=12 February 1938|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|page=5|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

On 23 May 1937, a group of four climbers descended down the face on a different route and were able to find a golden ring and a golden watch, which they sent to the airline. The found some body parts which they offered to recover for 500 [[Norwegian krone]], but this was rejected. Heggenes stated that these were parts which had been buried by the previous expedition.<ref name=p92/>

To replace the aircraft, DNL bought another Ju-52, named ''Falken'', used from Lufthansa.<ref>Nerdrum (1986): 80</ref>
Parts from the wreck are on display at [[Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/75-r-siden-frste-flytragedie-2519251.html |title=75 <U+00E5>r siden f<U+00F8>rste flytragedie |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=13 June 2011 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 July 2011 |archivedate=20 July 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60Jg4UFZl}}</ref> On 14 June 2008, a memorial was erected half-way up the mountain, with 200 people attending the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Mintes-laquoHavrnraquo-ulykken-1890320.html |title=Mintes <U+00AB>Hav<U+00F8>rn<U+00BB>-ulykken |last=Haugen |first=Erlend Langeland |date=15 June 2008 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 July 2011 |archivedate=20 July 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60JfqqU48}}</ref>
