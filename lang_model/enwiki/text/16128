'''Madonna''' (born '''Madonna Louise Ciccone''' ({{IPA-it|t<U+0283>ik<U+031A><U+02C8>ko<U+02D0>ne}} {{respell|chee-CO-nay}}); August 16, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter, actress and entrepreneur. Born in [[Bay City, Michigan]], she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums by which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", "[[Papa Don't Preach]]", "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Frozen (song)|Frozen]]", "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", "[[Hung Up]]", and "[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]". Critics have praised Madonna for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy.

Her career was further enhanced by film appearances that began in 1979, despite mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress <U+2013> Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her role in ''[[Evita (film)|Evita]]'' (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer. Madonna has been acclaimed as a businesswoman. In 1992, she founded entertainment company [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]] as a joint venture with [[Time Warner]]. In 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120&nbsp;million contract with [[Live Nation]].

Madonna has sold more than 300&nbsp;million records worldwide and is recognized as the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's top-selling female recording artist of all time]] by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second [[List of best-selling music artists in the United States|top-selling female artist in the United States]], behind [[Barbra Streisand]], with 64&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums. In 2008, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine ranked Madonna at number two, behind only [[The Beatles]], on the [[Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Charts|''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists]], making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the Billboard chart. She was also inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in the same year. Considered to be one of the "25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry.

==Life and career==
===1958<U+2013>81: Early life and career beginnings===
Madonna was born in [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], Michigan, on August 16, 1958. Her father, Silvio Anthony Ciccone, is a first-generation [[Italian American]], while her mother, Madonna Louise (n<U+00E9>e Fortin), was of [[French Canadian]] descent.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=10}}</ref> The Ciccone family originated from [[Pacentro]], Italy; her father later worked as a design engineer for [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]]. Madonna was nicknamed "Little Nonni" to distinguish her from her mother.<ref name="nowmadonna">{{cite news|first=Denise|last=Worrell|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957025,00.html |title=Now: Madonna on Madonna|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1985-05-27|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref name="thechild">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400097/The-child-who-became-a-star.html|title=The Child Who Became a Star: Madonna Timeline|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2006-07-26|accessdate=2008-06-09| location=London}}</ref> The third of six children from the same two parents, her full-blood siblings are: Martin, Anthony, Paula, [[Christopher Ciccone|Christopher]], and Melanie.<ref name="foxbio">{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,193740,00.html?sPage=fnc.entertainment/madonna |title=Madonna Biography, Discography, Filmography|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=2008-06-05|date=2008-01-03}}</ref> Madonna was raised [[Roman Catholic]]. Upon receiving confirmation, she adopted [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] as an additional [[Confirmation#Confirmation_name|confirmation name]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://absolutemadonna.com/?page_id=1907 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Absolute Madonna |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref> She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and Avon Township (now part of [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]).

Her mother died of [[breast cancer]] at the age of 30 in 1963.<ref name="foxbio"/> Months before her mother's death, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, although she did not understand the reason.<ref name="mom"/> Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. "I remember feeling stronger than she was," Madonna recalled, "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child."<ref name="mom"/> Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion. [...] I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also."<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}</ref>

Madonna eventually learned to take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her grandmother<!-- paternal or maternal? --> in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take the place of their beloved mother.<ref name="mom"/> In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody."<ref name="mom"/> Terrified that her father could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.<ref name="mom"/> Her father married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson,<!-- when? are they still married? --> and they had two children: Jennifer and Mario Ciccone.<ref name="peoplebio">{{cite news|title=Madonna Biography: Part 1| work = [[People (magazine)|People]]|url=http://www.people.com/people/madonna/biography|accessdate =2008-05-28|date=2003-09-02}}</ref> At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.<ref name="mom"/> She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and then West Middle School. She was known for her high [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], and  achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the [[jungle gym|monkey bars]] during recess, and pull up her skirt during class<U+2014>all so that the boys could see her underwear.<ref name="tarabio">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=23}}</ref>

During a late night, Madonna was returning from a rehearsal, when she was dragged up an alleyway by a pair of men and forced to perform [[fellatio]] at knifepoint. Madonna had later commented that "the episode was a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it."<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=56}}</ref> While performing as a dancer for the French disco artist [[Patrick Hernandez]] on his 1979 world tour,<ref name="tarabio"/> Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy.

In 1980 she left Breakfast Club and, with her former boyfriend [[Stephen Bray]] as drummer, formed the band Emmy.

Madonna moved in with boyfriend [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], asking his help for finishing the album's production. Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", which was her third single. The overall sound of ''Madonna'' is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of [[LinnDrum|Linn drum machine]], [[Moog Taurus|Moog bass]] and the [[synthesizer|OB-X synthesizer]].<ref name=tara1/><ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=11}}</ref> The album peaked at number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and yielded the hit singles "Holiday", "[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]" and "[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]".<ref name="bbalbums">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=madonna-p64565/charts-awards/billboard-albums|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Gradually, Madonna's look and manner of dressing, her performances and her music videos started influencing young girls and women. Her style became a female fashion trend of the 1980s.

In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft drink manufacturer [[Pepsi]]. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted her song "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]".

In 1992, Madonna had a role in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' as Mae Mordabito, a baseball player on an all-women's team. She recorded the film's theme song, "[[This Used to Be My Playground]]", which became a Hot 100 number one hit.<ref name="ach"/> The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]], consisting of a record company ([[Maverick Records]]), a film production company ([[Maverick Films]]), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with [[Time Warner]] and paid Madonna an advance of $60&nbsp;million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with [[Sony]].<ref name="NYT - $60 million"/> The first release from the venture was Madonna's book, entitled ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]''.

Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny of critics. [[Robert McQueen Grant|Robert M. Grant]], author of ''Contemporary Strategy Analysis'' (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest."<ref name=CSA>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=6}}</ref> He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.<ref name=CSA/> Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of "Find a winning formula and stick to it." Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing."<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=3}}</ref> Conversely, ''Rolling Stone'' has named Madonna "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics, and a better studio singer than her live spectacles attest."<ref name="Rolling Biography"/> [[Mark Bego]], author of ''Madonna: Blonde Ambition'', called her "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a "heavyweight talent."<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=122}}</ref> Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Chaka Khan]].<ref name="fouzvocal"/>

Throughout her career, Madonna has written and co-written most of her own materials, as well as songs of other artists such as [[Nick Kamen]]'s "[[Each Time You Break My Heart]]" and [[Gary Barlow]]'s "[[Love Won't Wait]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=2947550&search_in=c&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=25&start=1|title=Works written by Madonna L. Ciccone|publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]|accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref> According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing "incredible" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music.  As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single "[[Into the Groove]]" and its line "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine."<ref name="fouz55">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=55<U+2013>58}}</ref> From 1983 to 1986, Madonna's musical productions were often girlish and na<U+00EF>ve in nature, focusing primarily on love, romance, passion and boy-meets-girl relationships.<ref name="fouz55"/> This changed with the album ''Like a Prayer'', when the lyrics became much more personal, such as in "Promise to Try", which references Madonna's lingering pain at the loss of her mother.<ref name="fouz55"/> Madonna's lyrics often suggest an identification with the gay community. Fouz believes that when Madonna sings "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" in "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]", she is addressing both the gay audience and the heterosexual female.<ref name="fouz55"/> Even in the ''Erotica'' era, with its often adult-oriented lyrics, the songs appear free-flowing and gullible ("So won't you go down, where it's warm inside" <U+2014> "Where Life Begins" from ''Erotica''). Madonna's songwriting ability has been criticized, with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Maria Raha calling her lyrics "flighty and not sophisticated. Madonna can only bring a trunk full of trite lyrics on the long standing tradition of pop music, love; when she wasn't singing about love, she was singing about partying and dancing."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Raha|first=Maria|date=1987-09-21|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|title=Cinderella's big score: women of the punk and indie underground |volume=1078|issue=09|issn=0032-791X|ref=harv}}</ref> Her lyrics were considered banal, and her songwriting capability was largely ignored by critics until the release of ''Ray of Light'' and ''Music''. According to Jarman-Ivens, lyrics such as "You're frozen, when your heart's not open" ("[[Frozen (song)|Frozen]]", 1998) and "I can't remember, when I was young, I can't express if it was wrong" ("Paradise (Not for Me)", 2000) reflected an artistic palette, "encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics."<ref name="fouz55"/>

[[File:MadonnaVirginTour cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Madonna, seen here on [[The Virgin Tour]], had a bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] that became pass<U+00E9> in her later works.]]
She started her musical career with songs that she described as "soulful pop music". Madonna recalled in a 1983 interview with ''Island'' magazine that she had wanted to grow up as a black kid.<ref name="island">{{cite journal|title=Madonna: Virgin Pop|last=Simmons|first=Collin|date=October 1983|work=Island|publisher=Dolores Press Ltd|page=23|volume=9}}</ref> "First of all, all the black girls in my neighborhood had these dances in their yard where they had these little turntables with 45 records and they'd play all this Motown stuff and they would dance, just dance, all of them dancing together and none of the white kids I knew would ever do that. They were really boring and stiff. And I wanted to be part of the dancing. I didn<U+2019>t like my friends. I had to be beaten up so many times by these little black girls before they would accept me and finally one day they whipped me with a rubber hose till I was like, lying on the ground crying. And then they just stopped doing it all of a sudden and let me be their friend, part of their group."<ref name="island"/> On her 1983 debut album, Madonna's vocal abilities and personal artistry were not fully formed. Her vocal style was similar to other pop stars of that period like [[Paula Abdul]], [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Taylor Dayne]].<ref name="fouzvocal">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=59<U+2013>61}}</ref> The songs on ''Madonna'' reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], highly polished [[arrangement]]s and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as "Lucky Star" and "Borderline", Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to gay audiences. The bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] of the early years became pass<U+00E9> in Madonna's later works, the change being deliberate, since Madonna was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as "Minnie Mouse on helium", because of her early voice.<ref name="fouzvocal"/> Her second album, ''Like a Virgin'' (1984), foreshadowed several trends in Madonna's later works. It contained references to classical works ([[pizzicato]] synthesizer line that opens "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]"); potential negative reaction from social groups ("[[Dress You Up]]" was blacklisted by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]); and retro styles ("Shoo-Bee-Doo", Madonna's homage to [[Motown]]).<ref name="fouzvocal"/> Madonna's early style, and the change that she ushered in it, is best evident in the song "Material Girl". It opens with Madonna using a little-girl voice, but following the first verse, she switches to a richer, more mature voice in the [[chorus effect|chorus]].<ref name="fouzvocal"/> This mature artistic statement was visible in ''True Blue'' (1986). The song "Papa Don't Preach" was a significant milestone in her artistic career. The classical introduction, fast tempo and the gravity in her voice was unprecedented in Madonna's <U+0153>uvre at that time.<ref name="fouzvocal"/>

With ''Like a Prayer'' (1989), Madonna again entered a new phase, musically. The album introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and gospel music.<ref name="bookalbum"/> Madonna continued to compose ballads and [[Glossary of musical terminology|uptempo]] dance songs for ''Erotica'' (1992) and ''Bedtime Stories'' (1994). She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] into her music. Her voice grew much deeper and fuller, evident in the tracks like "Rain" and "Take a Bow".<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=44}}</ref> During the filming of ''Evita'', Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, "I studied with a vocal coach for ''Evita'' and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lamsweerde|first=Inez van|coauthors=Matadin, Vinoodh|date=April 1998|title=Madonna Chooses Dare|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|volume=14|issue=4|pages=70<U+2013>76|issn=0886-3032|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Jq-A2xEoAHIC&pg=PA70|accessdate=2010-02-26|ref=harv}}</ref> Continuing her musical evolution with ''Ray of Light'', the track "Frozen" displayed her fully formed vocal prowess and her allusions to classical music. Her vocals were restrained and she sang the songs in ''Ray of Light'' without vibrato. However, the intake of breath within the songs became more prominent.<ref name="fouzvocal"/> With the new millennium came her album ''Music'' in which Madonna sang in her normal voice in a medium range, and sometimes in a higher register for the chorus.<ref name="fouzvocal"/> A change was also noted in the content of the songs, with most of them being simple love songs, but with an underlying tone of melancholy. As she explained, "I sing about shattering an image that you have of somebody, but I also sing about loving someone that wish you didn<U+2019>t love. Because you know that you<U+2019>re doomed, but you can<U+2019>t stop yourself."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Johny|date=August 2000|issn=0263-1210|work=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|publisher=[[EMAP]]|title=It's My Love-You-But-Fuck-You Record|volume=32|issue=8|page=23}}</ref> Such melancholics continued in her next record ''American Life'', which was infused with thumping techno rhythm, liquid keyboard lines, acoustic choruses and a [[rapping|rap]] on the title track. The unconventional rock songs of the album were intermingled with dramatic lyrics about patriotism and composition, including the appearance of a gospel choir in the song "[[Nothing Fails]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Paul|date=April 2003|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|title=Madonna Attacks|volume=67|issn=0955-4955|page=31}}</ref> Musically, things changed with ''Confessions on a Dance Floor'', which returned Madonna to pure dance songs, infusing club beats and retro music, but the lyrics continued to be about [[paradox|paradoxical]] metaphors and reference to her earlier works.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew Todd|title=Madonna: Confessions of an Icon|date=November 2005|work=[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]|publisher=Vitality Publishing}}</ref> Her most recent studio album, ''Hard Candy'', saw her mixing R&B and hip hop music with dance tunes.

===Influences===
[[File:Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Marilyn Monroe]] (pictured) had a profound influence on Madonna.|alt=Bust of a blond woman in short curled hair and wearing a bright pink, sleeveless dress. Putting both her hands up, she looks to the right of the image.]]

According to Taraborrelli, "Almost certainly, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood<U+2014>the one that would have the most influence in shaping her into the woman she would become<U+2014>was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother."<ref name="mom">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=11<U+2013>13}}</ref> Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests that her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss,  the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them."<ref name="mom"/> Conversely, author [[Lucy O'Brien]] feels that the impact of the rape is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html|title=Madonna: Like an Icon, By Lucy O'Brien|last=Burston|first=Paul|date=2007-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-06|work=The Independent | location=London}}</ref>

As they grew older, Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting, farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet [[Anne Sexton]] and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry with [[Sylvia Plath]] being her favourite.<ref name="mom"/> Later, Madonna commented: "We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying<U+2014>after I got over my heartache<U+2014>I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself."<ref name="mom"/> Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. "Her death had taught her a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness<U+2014>particularly her own<U+2014>and wanted to be the queen of her own castle."<ref name="mom"/>

In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" by [[Nancy Sinatra]]; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".<ref name="hot"/> As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was [[baroque music|baroque]], and loved [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]] because she liked their "feminine quality".<ref>{{harvnb|St. Michael|2004|p=199}}</ref> Other musical influences included artists [[Karen Carpenter]], [[The Supremes]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and dancers such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9901/19/madonna.lkl/|last=King|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry King|title=Interview: Madonna reviews life on Larry King Live| publisher=CNN| date=1999-01-19|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref> Madonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents were reflected in the album ''Like a Prayer''.<ref name="laprsreview"/> It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|pp=126<U+2013>131}}</ref> Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata.

During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, "I loved [[Carole Lombard]] and [[Judy Holliday]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. They were all incredibly funny&nbsp;... and I saw myself in them&nbsp;... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence."<ref name="hot">{{cite journal|last=Worrell|first=Denise|title=Madonna, Why She's Hot|journal=Time|date=1985-05-27| accessdate=2007-12-16|issn= 0040-781X|ref=harv}}</ref> Her "Material Girl" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", from the film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]''. She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film ''Who's That Girl''. The video for "Express Yourself" (1989) was inspired by [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). The video for "Vogue" recreated the style of [[Glamour (presentation)|Hollywood glamour]] photographs, in particular those by [[Horst P. Horst]], and imitated the poses of [[Marlene Dietrich]], Carole Lombard and [[Rita Hayworth]], while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including [[Bette Davis]], described by Madonna as an idol.<ref name="carrie"/><ref>{{harvnb|Victor|2001|p=78}}</ref> Influences also came to her from the art world, most notably through the works of artist [[Frida Kahlo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=170}}</ref> The music video of the song "Bedtime Story" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and [[Remedios Varo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guralnick|Wolk|2000|p=149}}</ref> Her 2003 video for "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]" was an homage to the work of photographer [[Guy Bourdin]]; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorised use of his father's work.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Susman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,491440,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Strike a Pose|date=2003-09-30|accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref> Pop artist [[Andy Warhol]]'s use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for "Erotica" and "Deeper and Deeper".<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=69}}</ref> However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community. Stephanie Zacharek, critic for ''Time'' magazine, stated that, "[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest."<ref name="filmcareer">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=293}}</ref> According to biographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt."<ref name="filmcareer"/> After the 2002 box-office bomb ''Swept Away'', Madonna vowed that she would never act in a film, hoping that her repertoire as a bad actress will never be discussed again.<ref name="filmcareer"/>

Madonna is dedicated to [[Kabbalah]] and in 2004, she adopted the name [[Esther (given name)|Esther]] which in [[Persian language|Persian]] means "star".<ref name="kab"/> She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject.<ref name="kab">{{harvnb|Friskics-Warren|2006|p=72}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickross.com/reference/kabbalah/kabbalah88.html |title=Madonna opens her own school|work=[[The Times of India]]|last=Ross|first=Rick|date= 2004-08-05|accessdate= 2006-02-20|publisher=[[The Times Group]]}}</ref> She faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity [[wikt:dilettantism|dilettantism]].

===Music videos and performances===
[[File:Madonna wembley 1.jpg|thumb|Madonna performing at the [[Confessions Tour]] in 2006|alt=A female blond performer wearing a red top. She is holding a microphone in her brown-gloved right hand.]]
In ''The Madonna Companion'', biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.<ref name="metz2">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=161}}</ref> According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer" or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the song and their impact, rather than the song itself.<ref name="metz2"/> Morton felt that "artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos."<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=20}}</ref> Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.<ref name="metz2"/> She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=163}}</ref> The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the ''True Blue'' era.<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=145}}</ref> Author [[Douglas Kellner]] noted, "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences".<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=271}}</ref> Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of "La Isla Bonita".<ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=44}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=34}}</ref> Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.<ref>{{harvnb|Welton|1998|p=234}}</ref> This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for "Like a Prayer". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=70}}</ref> Madonna has been honored with record-breaking 20 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, including the lifetime achievement "[[MTV Video Vanguard Award|Video Vanguard Award]]" in 1986 for her contributions to the world of music video.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Who has won the most MTV Video Music Awards?|date=March 2008|accessdate=2010-06-15|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=Vibe Media Group|issn=1070-4701|volume=16|issue=2|page=58}}</ref>

Madonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV, and, according to Chris Nelson from ''[[The New York Times]]'', "with its almost exclusively [[lip sync|lip-sync]]ed videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words."<ref name="sync">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/arts/music/01NELS.html?pagewanted=1|title=Lip-Synching Gets Real|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=2004-02-01|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. Chris Nelson of ''The New York Times'' reported, "Artists like Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]] set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing."<ref name="sync"/> Thor Christensen of the ''[[The Dallas Morning News|Dallas Morning News]]'' commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by "stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe&nbsp;... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time."<ref name="lip-sync">{{Cite news| last1 = Christensen|first1 = Thor|title = Loose Lips: Pop Singers' Lip-Syncing In Concert Is An Open Secret| page = B.8|newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date = 2001-09-15| issn = 1068624X| ref = harv| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, she was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth.

Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. Thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized.<ref>{{harvnb|Diamond|1996|p=202}}</ref> Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are deemed as "extravagant show piece, a walking art show."<ref> {{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref>

Caryn Ganz from ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that "Madonna is the most media-savvy American pop star since [[Bob Dylan]] and, until she toned down her press-baiting behavior in the nineties, she was the most consistently controversial one since [[Elvis Presley]]." According to him, her self-celebrating dance music and outr<U+00E9> videos provided feminism with a makeover. Throughout the eighties Madonna broke down sexual boundaries, making eroticism a crucial pop-song element, and challenging social and religious mores. Ganz felt that one fact was rarely disputed: "At nearly every turn, Madonna has maintained firm control over her career and image."<ref name="Rolling Biography"/> Throughout her career the singer has repeatedly reinvented herself through a series of visual and musical personas, earning her the nickname "Queen of Reinvention".<ref>{{harvnb|Gallo|2006|p=67}}</ref> In doing so, "she exploited her sexuality to fashion herself into a cultural and commercial icon who, for more than a decade, was unchallenged as the reigning Queen of Pop music."<ref>{{harvnb|Axelrod|2007|p=103}}</ref> Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez agrees that these reinventions are one of her key cultural achievements.<ref name="fouz3">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=168}}</ref> Madonna reinvented herself by working with upcoming talented producers and previously unknown artists, while remaining at the center of media attention. According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, "In doing so Madonna has provided an example of how to maintain one's career in the entertainment industry."<ref name="fouz3"/> Such reinvention was noted by scholars as the main tool in surviving the musical industry, for a female artist.<ref>{{harvnb|Tetzlaff|1993|p=259}}</ref> As Ian Youngs from [[BBC News]] commented, "Her ability to follow the latest trends and adapt her style has often been credited with preserving her appeal."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2953665.stm|title=Madonna fights to keep pop crown|publisher=BBC|date=2003-04-18|author=Ian Youngs|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> Madonna's use of shocking sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism.<ref name="fouz3"/> ''The Times'' stated, "Madonna, whether you like her or not, started a revolution amongst women in music&nbsp;... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice."<ref name="fouz2"/> Rodger Streitmatter, author of ''Sex Sells!'' (2004), commented that "from the moment Madonna burst onto the nation's radar screen in the mid-1980s, she did everything in her power to shock the public, and her efforts paid off."<ref name="sex sells">{{harvnb|Streitmatter|2004|p=34}}</ref> Shmuel Boteach, author of ''Hating women'' (2005), felt that Madonna was largely responsible for erasing the line between music and pornography. He stated: "Before Madonna, it was possible for women more famous for their voices than their cleavage, to emerge as music superstars. But in the post-Madonna universe, even highly original performers such as Janet Jackson now feel the pressure to expose their bodies on national television to sell albums."<ref>{{harvnb|Boteach|2005|p=110}}</ref>

{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=Very few public figures are such wizards at manipulating the press and cultivating publicity as Madonna is. She has always been a great tease with journalists, brash and outspoken when the occasion demanded it, recalcitrant and taciturn when it came time to pull back and slow down the striptease. Madonna is a self-created woman, no question, but it was not a virgin birth: her adroit handling of the press played a major part in the consummation. Publicity is the name of the game.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Becky|title=Madonna: Changed Woman|date=May 1989|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|publisher=CNET Networks|issn=0149-8932|volume=24|issue=9|page=34}}</ref>|source=<U+2014>Becky Johnson from ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' commenting on Madonna's popularity.

Madonna has influenced numerous music artists throughout her career. Mary Cross, in her book ''Madonna: A Biography'', wrote: "Her influence on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching. New pop icons from [[Nelly Furtado]] and [[Shakira]] to [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] (not to mention [[Britney Spears]]) owe Madonna, a debt of thanks for the template she forged, combining provocative sexiness and female power in her image, music, and lyrics."<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=107}}</ref> According to Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez, female pop performers such as Spears, the [[Spice Girls]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] were like "Madonna's daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her."<ref name="fouz4">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=161}}</ref> Among them, Madonna's influence was most notable in Spears, who has been called her prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>.<ref name="fouz2">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=162}}</ref> Madonna has also been credited with the introduction of European [[electronic dance music]] into mainstream American pop culture, and for bringing European producers such as [[Stuart Price]] and [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]] into the spotlight.<ref name="fouz"/>

Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen in her industry, "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2&nbsp;billion in sales within the first decade of her career.<ref name="Routledge">{{harvnb|Kramarae|Spender|2000|p=459}}</ref> As Taraborrelli noted, she already showed strong business sensibilities early in her career when she signed Freddie de Mann, Michael Jackson's former manager, to manage her career.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=99}}</ref> As she said to ''[[Smash Hits]]'' magazine, "I thought, who<U+2019>s the most successful person in the music industry and who<U+2019>s his manager? I want him." Since it was Jackson, Madonna wanted de Mann more than anything else, and chance came when she learned that they have parted ways recently. After signing de Mann, her Madonna's associates had expressed their apprehension as to whether that was a good business decision by her. Madonna was adamant that since de Mann was free he would be able to devote all his time into his career. True to her, Madonna's popularity increased significantly, being asked to do more promotional tours and media appearances.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellen|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Ellen|title=Madonna: Queen Kajagoogoo|date=1984-06-02|work=[[Smash Hits]]|publisher=[[EMAP|EMAP Metro]]|issn=0260-3004|volume=12|page=13}}</ref> Her seriousness towards her business was also portrayed in the ''Truth or Dare'' documentary, in a scene where Madonna throws out the cameraman as she was going to have a business meeting. This led Taraborrelli to comment that "she always knew the importance of the outcomes of these discussions with her associates. And she wanted the element of surprise."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=312}}</ref> After its establishment, Maverick Records became a major commercial success from her efforts, which was unusual at that time for an artist-established label.<ref name="susmanchaos">{{cite news|title=So-called Chaos|first=Gary|last=Susman|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,652432,00.html|date=2004-06-15|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> Music journalist Robert Sandall said that while interviewing Madonna, it was clear that being "a cultural big hitter" was more important to her than pop music, a career she described as "an accident". He also saw a contrast between her anything-goes sexual public persona and a secretive and "paranoid" attitude toward her own finances; she fired her own brother when he charged her for an extra item.<ref name="sandall">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6015124.ece|last=Sandall|first=Robert|title=Why Madonna is still a Material Girl|work=The Times|date=2009-04-05|accessdate=2009-08-09| location=London}}</ref> Professor Colin Barrow of the [[Cranfield School of Management]] described Madonna as "America's smartest businesswoman... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself".

But that hardly mattered to her."<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=89}}</ref> Taraborrelli felt that this ruthlessness was visible during the shooting of the Pepsi commercial in 1989. "The fact that she didn't want to hold a Pepsi can in the commercial, clued the Pepsi executives that Madonna the pop star and Madonna the businesswoman were not going to be dictated by somebody else, she will do everything in her way<U+2014>the only way."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=167}}</ref> Conversely, reporter Michael McWilliams commented: "The gripes about Madonna<U+2013>she's cold, greedy, talentless<U+2013>conceal both bigotry and the essence of her art, which is among the warmest, the most humane, the most profoundly satisfying in all pop culture."<ref>{{cite news|last=McWilliams|first=Michael|title=Why the rock world hates Madonna|work=[[The Detroit News|Detroit News]]|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080224/ENT04/802240345/1031/POLITICS01|date=1990-04-21|accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref>
