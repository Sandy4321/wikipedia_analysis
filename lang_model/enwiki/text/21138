'''''Vampyros Lesbos''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|'''Las Vampiras'''}}) is a 1971 West German-Spanish horror film directed and co-written by [[Jes<U+00FA>s Franco]]. The film is stars [[Ewa Stroemberg]]  as Linda Westinghouse who is an American who works in a Turkish legal firm. Westinghouse has  a series of erotic dreams that involve a mysterious [[vampire]] woman who seduces her before feeding on her blood. When she travels to an island to settle an inheritance, Lucy recognizes a woman as the vampire from her dreams.

The film was a popular success in theaters in Europe on its release and was the first film to have a more psychedelic score for a Franco film and the first to have a [[lesbian]] theme as a prominent feature of the film. The film's score became popular in the mid-1990s when it was included on the compilation ''Vampyros Lesbos: Sexadelic Dance Party'', an album that became a top ten hit on the British Alternative charts.
