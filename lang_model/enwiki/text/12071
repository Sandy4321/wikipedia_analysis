'''''American Gangster''''' is a 2007 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama film|drama]] [[crime film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and written by [[Steve Zaillian]]. The film is based on the criminal career of [[Frank Lucas]], a gangster from [[La Grange, North Carolina]] who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the [[Vietnam War]] before being detained by a task force lead by detective [[Richie Roberts]]. It features [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]] in leading roles, with [[Ted Levine]], [[John Ortiz]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Norman Reedus]], [[Ruby Dee]], and [[Lymari Nadal]] in supporting roles.

Development for the film initially began in 2000, when [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story about the rise and fall of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] introduced a 170-page [[film treatment|scriptment]] to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in [[Toronto]] for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with [[Terry George]], it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout [[New York City]] and concluded in [[Thailand]].

''American Gangster'' premiered in New York on October 20, 2007, and was released in the United States and Canada on November 2. The film was well received by most film critics, and grossed over US$266.5 million worldwide, with domestic grossed standing at $130.1 million. Many of the people portrayed, including Roberts and Lucas, have stated that the film took many creative licenses with the story, and three former [[DEA]] agents sued Universal claiming the agency's portrayal was demoralizing. ''American Gangster'' was nominated for twenty-one awards, including two [[Academy Awards]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Ruby Dee), and won three including a [[14th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Dee.

==Plot==

In 1968, [[Frank Lucas]] ([[Denzel Washington]]), the limo driver-turned-right-hand man of [[Harlem]] [[gangster]] [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]] ([[Clarence Williams III]]), inherits his gang once Johnson dies of a heart attack. Frank decides to take control of Harlem's crime scene as he dislikes the new, flashy gangsters of the neighborhood. Meanwhile, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] [[detective]] [[Richie Roberts]] ([[Russell Crowe]]) is hated in his precinct for being honest. After his exiled and addicted partner ([[John Ortiz]]) dies from accidentally overdosing on a relatively low-priced but unusually potent brand of [[heroin]] called "Blue Magic", Captain Lou Toback ([[Ted Levine]]) puts Roberts in charge of a task force targeting major drug trafficking in [[Essex County, New Jersey]]. The investigation will focus the actual supplier rather than the [[Reseller|middle-men]].

Blue Magic is being supplied by Lucas, who has decided to buy his drugs directly from producers in [[Thailand]], which is then smuggled by U.S. servicemen returning from the [[Vietnam War]]. This allows Lucas to provide a higher quality product at a cheaper price than his rivals, eventually wholesaling drugs to most of the dealers in the [[New York City|New York]] area. With Blue Magic's monopoly, Lucas quickly makes a fortune, buying several nightclubs and a large estate in New Jersey for his humble mother ([[Ruby Dee]]). Lucas' five brothers are enlisted as his lieutenants in the drug trade. During his rise to becoming the biggest gang leader and drug dealer in Harlem, Lucas meets and falls in love with Eva ([[Lymari Nadal]]), a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] beauty queen. 

As Lucas' business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting the attention of the police. However, Lucas disregards this habit while attending the [[Fight of the Century]] with Eva, sporting a gaudy [[chinchilla]] fur coat and hat; Roberts attends the fight notices the previously-unknown Lucas and decides to investigate. Meanwhile, Lucas is forced to contend with [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] [[mafia]] boss Dominic Cattano ([[Armand Assante]]) and corrupt [[NYPD]] detectives such as Nick Trupo ([[Josh Brolin]]), who attempt to [[extort]] and threaten him. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure [[Nicky Barnes]] ([[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]]). Things take a turn for the worse when the [[Fall of Saigon]] cuts off Lucas' supply.

Roberts' detectives witness Frank's cousin ([[Malcolm Goodwin]]) shooting a woman, and then use his driver<U+2019>s predicament to get him to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]]. This allows Roberts and his task force to search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, eventually finding Blue Magic on the coffins of returning war dead; this evidence allows them to obtain a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to follow drugs into Newark's projects. Meanwhile, Trupo and his men break into Lucas' mansion, kill his dog, and steal his emergency cash supply.  Lucas initially sets out to kill Trupo, but his mother manages to dissuade him. Lucas is arrested when Roberts' team conducts a search of the Newark projects.

In the police station, Roberts gives Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation. With no other options, Lucas provides names of dirty cops in the NYPD. In the end, three quarters of the New York [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo shoots himself to avoid arrest. Roberts, having passed the bar exam, prosecutes Lucas, who once condemned provides evidence that leads to more than one-hundred further drug-related convictions.

In 2000, [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to "The Return of Superfly", a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story by [[Mark Jacobson]] about the rise and fall of the 1970s heroin kingpin [[Frank Lucas]].<ref name="fame">{{Cite news | author=Kleinknecht, William | title=FROM FOES TO FRIENDS AND NOW ON TO FAME | work=[[The Star-Ledger]] | date=October 5, 2006 }}</ref> In 2002, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] brought a 170-page script to director [[Ridley Scott]], who expressed interest in making two films from it.  However, Scott did not immediately pursue the project, choosing to make ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' instead.

Universal Pictures reported that it greenlit ''American Gangster'' with a budget of $80&nbsp;million, which escalated to $93&nbsp;million, with $10&nbsp;million for development costs and $3&nbsp;million for the delay of the production start date.  Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93&nbsp;million from the beginning.  The studio also sought for ''American Gangster'' to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location.  The studio's parent company [[General Electric]] received [[tax credit]]s in New York City, so production was moved to the city.  The move, however, inflated the budget to $98&nbsp;million.  Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him.  The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as [[Ray Liotta]] and [[John C. Reilly]] in minor roles.  To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process.  The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.<ref name=wrap>{{Cite news | author=Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca  | coauthors=Jeff Jensen | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,724273,00.html | title='Gangster' Wrap |work=Entertainment Weekly  | date=October 22, 2004 | accessdate=November 3, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071115130416/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,724273,00.html| archivedate= November 15, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In March 2005, ''American Gangster'' was revived as Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with [[Terry George]] to revise Zaillian's script and direct the film, which was to be financed with a target budget of US $50&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117919334.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=U's still high on 'Gangster' | work=Variety | date=March 13, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}</ref> [[Will Smith]] was approached to replace Washington as Frank Lucas, though an offer would be held off until George completed his revision of the script.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117923659.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 | title=Thesp's 'American' dream | work=Variety | date=May 30, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}</ref> George cut many key scenes, characters and Asian locations to reduce costs.

After a meeting between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided he was ready to do it.

Scott had discussed the script with Crowe as they worked on ''A Good Year'' in France, and they sought to take on the project.  The director reviewed Zaillian's script, Terry George's rewrite, and a revision by [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] during the project's incarnation with director Antoine Fuqua.  Scott preferred Zaillian's approach and chose to follow it.  In realizing the project, the director encountered a challenge in the script since the characters Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts do not encounter each other until twenty minutes before the end of the film.  The director sought to flesh out the private universes of the characters that would evolve and have scenes cut between the two characters to provide a balance.  Elements like Frank Lucas's interaction with his family and Richie Roberts' dysfunctional marriage were written to add to the characters' backgrounds.<ref name=scott>{{Cite news | author=Douglas, Edward | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=38623 | title= Ridley Scott's ''American Gangster'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=October 25, 2007 | accessdate=November 3, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071027024412/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=38623| archivedate= October 27, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The rappers [[T.I.]], [[RZA]] and [[Common (entertainer)|Common]] were added to the cast to appeal to younger audiences.<ref name=jay />

Scott chose to direct ''American Gangster'' based on the paradoxical values of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The film focuses a bit on the comparatively ethical business practices of the "wicked gangster" and the womanizing and failed marriage of the "do-gooder" police detective. Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw "the arc of the character" had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions.<ref name="fame" /> To prepare for their roles, the actors met their real-life counterparts. Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's manner of speaking and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation.<ref name="fame" /> The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for ''American Gangster''.<ref name="going" /> It was rumored that Washington got paid another $20&nbsp;million for when the project was greenlit again; that rumor proved to be false, as he signed on for his gross.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/10/american-gangst.html |title=American Gangster: A Grazer Tale|author=Thompson, Anne |work=Thompson on Hollywood |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=Oct. 17, 2007 |quote=Denzel Washington had already gotten paid his upfront guarantee pay-or-play, so he signed on just for his gross.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071107134457/http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/10/american-gangst.html| archivedate= November 07 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The budget had escalated to $100 million, which Grazer stated was unexpected given "It's not a [[high-concept]] comedy, it's not a fantasy movie, it's not a [[four-quadrant movie]]".<ref name=ew/> Grazer and Scott still had to pay back the studio $3 million for a budget overrun.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/15/business/fi-gangster15/|title='Gangster' gets a shot|date=October 15, 2007|first=Claudia|last=Eller|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Bknavyard.JPG|thumb|left|Principal photography took place in several location throughout New York, including the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].|alt=Panoramic view of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.]]

Approximately fifty to sixty locations were set in Harlem alone. While in the neighbourhood, Scott stated that he found several interiors that had been untouched since the 1940s.<ref name=scott /> According to production designer Arthur Max, exhaustive location scouting was done to find parts of New York that could still resemble the city of the early 1970s, filming Lucas' headquarters at [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] 20 blocks north, on 136th Street.<ref name=notes>{{Cite web | url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2007/american_gangster_production_details.htm| title=''American Gangster'' Production Notes| work=Universal Pictures | accessdate=November 5, 2011 }}</ref> In his interview with [[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]], Scott stated that "[he] just walked in and just shoot in the house." Several [[gas masks]] were brought by producers due to health hazards and sanitary concerns existing in the buildings. Scott found filming in Harlem to be difficult, commenting that the rapid [[gentrification]] in Harlem provided poor opportunities for shooting angles.<ref name=scott /> [[Handheld camera]]s were extensively used to depict a <U+201C>guerilla filmmaking<U+201D> style.<ref name=notes/>

Other locations for principal photography include the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], [[Old Westbury Gardens]], a segment of the [[George Washington Bridge]], and the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Brooklyn Supreme Courthouse]]. [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]] in upstate [[New York]] had the locations for both the Lucas farm and the estate Frank buys for his family.<ref name=notes/> Filming locations began setting up in [[Thailand]] in November 2006, after [[Branko Lustig]] consulted with Suvit Yodmanee, the country's tourism minister.<ref name=star>{{cite web|url=http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/1/movies/15833311&sec=movies|title=Thailand beckons|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|publisher=Star Publications|date=November 1, 2006|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Filming for ''American Gangster'' concluded in [[Chiang Mai]] the following month.<ref name=star/>

Using his experience from visiting New York in the same time period in which the film's story took place, Scott sought to downplay a "[[Beatles]]" atmosphere to the film and to instead create a shabbier atmosphere, saying that "Harlem was really, really shabby, beautiful [[brownstone]]s falling apart."<ref name=scott />  Production and costume design was emphasized, transforming the location into the rundown streets of upper Manhattan from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Denzel Washington, as Frank Lucas, went through 64 different costume changes.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Schwartz, Robert | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963680.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 | title='Gangster' puts hit on gentrification | work=Variety | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}</ref>

===Music===
In 2006, [[Greg Calloway]] was approached by producer to produce a soundtrack for the film. He presented the idea to [[Atlantic Records]] chairman [[Craig Kallman]], and one of the company's artists, [[T.I.]], got an acting role in the film; but the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures own the rights to the film - <U+201C>It was a Universal film and they were not going to give the soundtrack to [[Warner Music Group|WMG]] (Atlantic's parent company)<U+201D>.<ref name="AG">{{cite web|url=http://gregcalloway.wordpress.com/bio/|title=Who Is Who is Greg Calloway?|publisher=Greg Calloway's official website|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref> Thus Scott brought back for the music [[Marc Streitenfeld]], who had worked with him in ''A Good Year''. The composer stated that "the overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker" given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of [[blues]] and [[soul music]] to fit the 1970s setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/soundtracks/INTERVIEW-Marc-Streitenfeld-7411.html|publisher=Cinema Blend|title=INTERVIEW - Marc Streitenfeld|first=Scott|last=Gwin|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref> The musical score for ''American Gangster'' was record between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself.

Denzel Washington pressed Grazer into inviting rapper [[Jay-Z]] to write the film's score, but the producer " just didn<U+2019>t think there<U+2019>d be enough for Jay-Z to do" given the intentions to do a soundtrack filled with 1970s music.<ref name=jay /> The film's trailer was already using Jay-Z's "Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)", and the rapper was invited to a advanced screening. The film had a profound resonance on the musician, who decided to create a concept album, also entitled ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]''.<ref name=notes /> The rapper recorded tracks that were prompted by specific scenes in the film.

<blockquote>
"It was like I was watching the film, and putting it on pause, and giving a back story to the story. It immediately clicked with me. Like ''Scarface'' or any one of those films, you take the good out of it, and you can see it as an inspiring film."<ref name=jay />

{{quote box|width=35%|align=left|quote="Like many moviemakers [...], Mr. Scott loves his bad guy too much. And by turning Lucas into a figure who seduces instead of repels, an object of directorial fetishism and a token of black resistance, however hollow, he encourages us to submit as well.

Yet there<U+2019>s also a historical dimension, because when Lucas strolls down a fast-emptying Harlem street after putting a bullet into another man<U+2019>s head and the camera pulls back for the long view, you are transported into the realm of myth.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a perfect four star rating and opined, "This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well."

Paul Byrnes of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' felt that ''American Gangster'' was "one of the most intelligent gangster films in years" and expressed that the film offers "the spectacle of grand themes and two bigger-than-life characters played by two of the best actors in cinema." Concluding his review, Byrnes gave the film a four out of four stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film-reviews/american-gangster/2008/01/03/1198949939913.html|title=American Gangster|first=Paul|last=Byrnes|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=January 3, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> [[IGN]]'s  Jim "Stax" Vejvoda rated the film four out of five stars, praising the acting - particularly of the two protagonists, "both dynamic presences on-screen, with neither actor outweighing the other's importance to the story" - and declaring that despite being preceded by other gangster stories such as ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''American Gangster'' managed to justify its existance with "emphasis on the human and class elements of the story".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/01/american-gangster-review-2|title=American Gangster Blu-ray Review|last=Monfette, Pirrello|first=Christopher, Phil|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111092627/http://movies.ign.com/articles/831/831913p1.html|archivedate=November 11, 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref> Manohla Dargis of the ''[[New York Times]]'' strongly commended the film, opining that "greatness hovers just outside ''American Gangster''."

In comparison, some reviewers were more critical of ''American Gangster''. Jonathan Crocker of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'' was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can<U+2019>t touch the urban texture and deep focus of ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'' and ''[[Prince of the City]]'' <U+2013> all looming heavily in intertextual nods." In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." In conclusion, Crocker gave the film a three out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84261/american-gangster.html|title=American Gangster (2007)|last=Crocker|first=Jonathan|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]|date=November 18, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Similarly, Owen Gleiberman  of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that ''American Gangster'' is "never dull, but it could have used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue."

[[Sterling Johnson, Jr.]], a federal judge who served as a special narcotics prosecutor for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] and assisted the arrest and trial of Lucas, described the film as "one percent reality and ninety-nine percent Hollywood." In addition, Johnson described the real life Lucas as "illiterate, vicious, violent, and everything Denzel Washington was not."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Coyle, Jake|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/295102|title=Fabrications dim American Gangster's Oscar hopes|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}</ref> Former [[DEA]] agents Jack Toal, Gregory Korniloff, and Louis Diaz filed a lawsuit against Universal saying that the events in the film were fictionalized and that the film [[defamation|defamed]] them and hundreds of other agents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&nav=F8nI|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080208093858/http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&nav=F8nI|archivedate=February 8, 2008|title=DEA agents sue over 'American Gangster' |publisher=[[WPRI]]}}</ref> The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by US District Judge Colleen McMahon. While McMahon noted that the [[intertitle]] that appears at the end of the film, stating that Lucas' collaboration lead to the arrest of many corrupt DEA agents, was "wholly inaccurate", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished that "It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to "show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent".<ref name=ABC/Reuters>{{Cite news|publisher =[[ABC News]]/[[Reuters]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/american-gangster-lawsuit-dismissed/1045622|title=American Gangster lawsuit dismissed|date= February 18, 2008}}</ref>

Many of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as being the right hand man of [[Bumpy Johnson]], rising above the power of the mafia and [[Nicky Barnes]], and that he was the mastermind behind the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a biographer of Frank Lucas, deemed the story as a myth. [[Associated Press]] entertainment writer Frank Coyle noted that "this mess happened partially because journalists have been relying on secondary sources removed from the actual events."<ref>Chepesiuk, Ron (January 17, 2008).
