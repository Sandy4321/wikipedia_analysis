'''Michel Chartrand''' (December 20, 1916 &ndash; April 12, 2010) was an [[Syndicalism|union activist]] and leader from [[Quebec]]. 

Born in [[Outremont]] and trained as a [[typography]] and print worker, Chartrand become involved in union activism in the 1940s. During the ''[[Grande Noirceur]]'', he took part in major [[strike action]]s such as the [[Asbestos Strike]] in 1949, the [[Louiseville Strike]] in 1952 and the [[Murdochville Strike]] in 1957. In 1968, he become president of the Montreal central council of the [[Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des syndicats nationaux]] (CSN). In 1970, during the [[October crisis]], he was arrested without a warrant and put in jail for four months. He was president of the CSN Montreal central council until 1978.  

During the 1980s, he took action for the rights of injured workers; he created the ''Fondation pour l<U+2019>aide aux travailleuses et les travailleurs accident<U+00E9>s'' (FATA) in 1984. He promoted progressive values and [[syndicalism]] in the media until the end of his life.  He endorsed [[Qu<U+00E9>bec Solidaire]].

Chartrand is considered to have been a promoter of [[socialism]], a severe [[Criticism of capitalism|critic of capitalism]]<ref name="EC">Diane Cailhier, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Params=F1ARTF0001536 ''Chartrand, Michel''], in Encyclop<U+00E9>die canadienne online [Retrieved July 23, 2011].</ref> and a leading figure of syndicalism in Quebec.<ref name="Bilandusiecle">[http://bilan.usherbrooke.ca/bilan/pages/evenements/23921.html ''D<U+00E9>c<U+00E8>s du syndicaliste Michel Chartrand''], in Bilan du si<U+00E8>cle online [Retrieved July 23, 2011].</ref> He was married to [[feminist]] writer and union activist [[Simonne Monet-Chartrand]].

==Education==
Born in the [[Montreal]] neighborhood of [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]], he studied at [[Coll<U+00E8>ge Jean-de-Br<U+00E9>beuf]] [[secondary school]] and [[CEGEP Lionel-Groulx|coll<U+00E8>ge Sainte-Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se]]. In 1933, he trained to be a [[Trappists|Trappist monk]], but left after two years and worked with a [[Roman Catholic Church]] youth movement. In the [[Quebec general election, 1939|1939 Quebec election]], he campaigned for the [[Action lib<U+00E9>rale nationale]] (ALN) party. In 1940, he enrolled in a history course at the [[Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al]] taught by [[Lionel Groulx]], a [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] Roman Catholic priest.

Chartrand is reported to have joined the Canadian Officer Training Corps in 1941 following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939. This program, conducted across Canada, allowed university students to be credited with military service while continuing their studies without being posted to active duty. Chartrand protested that the [[Canadian Army]] documents were only in the [[English language]], and returned to the Trappists' monastery in the village of [[Oka, Quebec]].

==Opponent of conscription==
Following the federal government's 1942 announcement of a national plebiscite on military [[conscription]], Michel Chartrand became an outspoken opponent and joined the [[Bloc populaire canadien]] movement to campaign against conscription.

In February 1942, he was married to [[Simonne Monet]] by Father [[Lionel Groulx]] at the [[Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal)|Notre-Dame Basilica]]. By the time the [[Parliament of Canada]] put the [[military draft]] in place in November 1944, Chartrand was the father of seven children.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 federal election]], he was the [[Bloc Populaire]] candidate in the [[Chambly-Rouville]] riding. He lost in a landslide to his [[Liberal Party of Canada]] opponent.

==Seeking elected office==
In 1948, his fifth child was born, and the following year he went to the [[Asbestos Regional County Municipality, Quebec|Asbestos Region]] to participate in the [[Asbestos Strike]] by local mine workers. In 1950, he became active with the executive committee of the [[CNTU|Catholic Workers Confederation of Canada]] (CTCC). Involved with a number of union operations, in 1953 Chartrand became a salaried member of the union's executive committee. After internal disputes, he was fired from his job. However, after appealing the decision, a tribunal under [[Pierre Trudeau]] reinstated him.

In 1954, Chartrand stood for election to the post of secretary-general of the union but was defeated by [[Jean Marchand]]. In 1956, he joined the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), a [[social democracy|social democratic]] federal political party headed in Quebec by [[Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Casgrain]]. Chartrand was appointed a Quebec delegate to the party's convention in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. As a result, a Quebec branch of the party was organized under the name [[Parti social d<U+00E9>mocratique du Qu<U+00E9>bec]]. Chartrand was the party's candidate in the Chambly riding in the [[Quebec general election, 1956|1956 provincial election]], but was badly defeated. His union duties involved numerous high-profile strikes, and he was seen by some as a future leader of the movement and was leader of the party from 1957 until 1960.

Chartrand ran for the CCF in the [[Canadian federal election, 1958|1958 federal election]] as a candidate in the town of [[Jonqui<U+00E8>re, Quebec|Arvida, Quebec]]. Despite a strong union base, he nevertheless lost by a wide margin. In 1959, Chartrand tried again for public office, running in a Quebec provincial [[by-election]] in [[Lac Saint-Jean, Quebec]], but once again was badly defeated. His frustration became evident through his growing extremist remarks, and in 1959, the union forced him to resign from its executive committee. He was then hired to work at the printing office of the Parti social-d<U+00E9>mocratique, and was a delegate again to the CCF's convention in Winnipeg.

==Peace advocacy and socialism==
In 1960, the Confederation of Catholic Workers of Canada changed its name to the [[Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des syndicats nationaux]] (CSN). Chartrand took part in the [[Peace movement]], participating in demonstrations and marches against [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]  proliferation and other causes. An admirer of the [[communist]] revolution in [[Cuba]] and its leader [[Fidel Castro]], in 1963 Chartrand accompanied a group on a month-long visit to Cuba. On his return to Quebec, he called Cuba "a paradise" and held it out as a symbol of what Quebec should become. Chartrand then helped found the [[Parti socialiste du Qu<U+00E9>bec]] (Socialist Party of Quebec), and, as its president, soon began supporting the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], the [[Rassemblement pour l'ind<U+00E9>pendance nationale]] (RIN).

==Involvement for Quebec Independence==
In 1968, Michel Chartrand was elected president of the Montr<U+00E9>al Central Council of the [[Conf<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des syndicats nationaux]], serving in that position until 1978. By the end of the 1960s, his views became more resolved. As a member of the Quebec Independence movement, Chartrand staunchly supported the [[Front de lib<U+00E9>ration du Qu<U+00E9>bec]] (FLQ) [[terrorists]] saying, "We are going to win because there are more boys ready to shoot [[Members of Parliament]] than there are policemen."{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

During the [[October Crisis]], when asked by a reporter about the ordeal the family of kidnapped British trade commissioner [[James Cross]] was being put through, Chartrand stated: "I have no more sympathy for Mrs. Cross than for the wives of thousands of men without jobs in Quebec at the present time." Even after the murder of Quebec vice-premier [[Pierre Laporte]], Chartrand remained steadfast in his beliefs, and proved it by bailing FLQ leader Charles Gagnon out of jail, paying nearly three thousand dollars of his own money. On October 15, 1975, five years after the October Crisis, FLQ and [[Front de rassemblement d'action populaire]] members and supporters met at the Paul-Sauv<U+00E9> Centre in [[Montreal]] where Michel Chartrand addressed the crowd.

In the [[Quebec general election, 1998|1998 Quebec election]], he again ran for political office. He represented the [[Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste]] (now [[Qu<U+00E9>bec solidaire]]) against [[Lucien Bouchard]] in Jonqui<U+00E8>re, finishing third with 14% of the votes.
