'''Ipswich''' is a passenger rail station on [[MBTA Commuter Rail|MBTA Commuter Rail's]] [[Newburyport/Rockport Line]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/stations/default.asp?stopId=93&lat=42.678355&lng=-70.840024| title=Ipswich| publisher=MBTA| year=2008| accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Before service on the line was restored to [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], Ipswich was the terminus of the line. Just south of the end of the platform are two auxiliary tracks that were used to store trains during that time. In recent years, parking in the area has been expanded to accommodate the influx of people. This includes the demolition of the old Ipswich Lanes [[candlepin bowling]] alley one block east of the station, to make way for a new parking garage for use by passengers and people going downtown alike.

==Connecting Service==
[[Ipswich Essex Explorer]] provides weekend service during the summer to [[Crane Beach]], downtown [[Essex, Massachusetts|Essex]] and other nearby attractions.
