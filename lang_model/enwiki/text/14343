The '''Commodore Joshua Barney House''' is a historic home located at [[Savage, Maryland|Savage]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It is comprised of three sections: the original two and one-half story brick house built about 1760, a 2-story frame addition built in 1941, and a one-story frame addition to the west, built in 1946. The interior of the house was altered during the 1940s when it was used as a boys' school, and about 1960 when it was converted into apartments. Its significance is tied to Commodore [[Joshua Barney]], who was a hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]] and retired to his home in [[Elkridge, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marylandhistoricaltrust.net/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=488&COUNTY=Howard&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Howard|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-11-21|work= Commodore Joshua Barney House, Howard County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}</ref> It is now operated as a [[bed and breakfast inn]].
