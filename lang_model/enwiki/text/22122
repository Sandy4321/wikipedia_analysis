'''Oakwood Cemetery''' is a [[nonsectarian]] [[rural cemetery]] in northeastern [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. It operates under the direction of the Troy Cemetery Association, a [[non-profit]] [[board of directors]] that deals strictly with the operation of the cemetery.<ref name=about/> It was established in 1848 in response to the growing rural cemetery movement in [[New England]] and went into service in 1850. The cemetery was designed by architect John C. Sidney and underwent its greatest development  in the late 19th century under superintendent John Boetcher, who incorporated rare foliage and a clear landscape design strategy. Oakwood was the fourth rural cemetery opened in New York and its governing body was the first rural cemetery association created in the state.

It features four man-made lakes, two residential structures, a [[chapel]], a [[crematorium]], 24 [[mausolea]], and about 60,000 [[grave (burial)|graves]], and has about {{convert|29|mi|km}} of roads. It is known for its dense foliage and rolling lawns, and has historically been used as a [[public park]] by [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]]{{#tag:ref|Lansingburgh is the northern section of Troy, though it progressed separately from Troy. It became a village in 1790 and was annexed as part of the city of Troy in 1900.<ref name=charter216>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=UO9EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA216#v=onepage&q=&f=false Charter of and laws relating to the city of Troy]'', p. 216</ref> See the [[:File:City of Troy map 2.svg|neighborhood map of Troy]] for a graphical representation.|group="n"}}  and Troy residents. Oakwood was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984. 

Prominent Americans such as [[Samuel Wilson|Uncle Sam Wilson]], [[Russell Sage]], and [[Emma Willard]], at least fourteen members of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and the founders of both Troy and Lansingburgh are buried at Oakwood.  The cemetery has been said to be "one of New York State's most distinguished and well-preserved nineteenth-century rural cemeteries."<ref name=nrhp9/> It also offers a famous panoramic view of the [[Hudson River Valley]] that is said to be the "most concentrated and complete overview of American history anywhere in America".<ref name=history/>

==History==
The first rural cemetery in the [[United States]]<U+2014>[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]<U+2014> was developed in the 1830s.<ref name=nrhp9>Harrison (1984), p. 9</ref> Rural cemeteries are burial grounds typically located on the fringe of a city that offer a natural setting for [[interment]] of the dead. The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the [[English garden|English garden movement]] of the early 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=nrhp9/>

[[File:Oakwood Keeper's Lodge.png|thumb|left|The office lodge in 1886|alt=Engraving of a two-story house with gabled roof and Tudor accents.]]
The Troy Cemetery Association was formed on September 9, 1848; John Paine, D. Thomas Vail, Isaac McConihe, George M. Tibbits, John B. Gale, and Stephen E. Warren were elected its trustees. The trustees appointed a committee to report on an eligible location for a cemetery and on September 5, 1849, the first parcel of land was purchased.<ref name=wise54>[http://books.google.com/books?id=J1wVAAAAYAAJ&dq=vanderheyden%20oakwood&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=&f=false Weise] (1886), p. 54</ref> It was the first rural cemetery association incorporated under an [[Rural Cemetery Act|1847 law]] authorizing the incorporation of such associations.<ref name=nrhp10>Harrison (1984), p. 10</ref> On October 16, 1850, the land of the cemetery was [[consecrated]]<ref name=weise55>[http://books.google.com/books?id=J1wVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q=&f=false Weise] (1886), p. 55</ref> and Oakwood became the fourth [[rural cemetery]] founded in [[New York]].<ref name=nrhp10/> The Association is made up lot owners who are elected by fellow lot owners; the position is voluntary and receives no pay.<ref name=about/>

Oakwood was designed by John C. Sidney, a [[Philadelphia]] engineer familiar with cemetery design. His plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and rolling hills, covering about {{convert|300|acre|ha}}, including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots were laid out in a seemingly haphazard manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.<ref name=nrhp10/>
[[File:Earl Crematorium 1901.png|thumb|Earl Crematorium c. 1901|alt=Engraving of a Romanesque building with a gabled roof, a square bell tower and a tall chimney]]
Although Sidney was the architect of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the [[Troy and Boston Railroad]] on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including [[umbrella pine]]s and [[Colorado blue spruce]].<ref name=nrhp11/>

In 1869, the City of Troy bought the property of the Third Street Burying Ground for the site of a new city hall. This was the burial site for many of Troy's earliest inhabitants including the Vanderheyden family and Jacob Lansing, founders of Troy and Lansingburgh respectively. Many of the remains were reinterred at Oakwood. With these reinterments, the graves within Oakwood span the entire the history of Troy.<ref name=nrhp13/> Although it was a cemetery by definition, Oakwood quickly became a place for recreation and was used in its early days as a public park. In response to its popularity, many memorials include benches in their design to invite visitors to rest while enjoying their visit. So popular was Oakwood that in 1908 the Association began a [[stage coach|stage]] service between the Oakwood Avenue and 114th Street entrances.<ref name=nrhp13/>

A {{convert|325|acre|ha|adj=on}} section of Oakwood was nominated for the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in August 1984<ref name=nrhp19>Harrison (1984), p. 19</ref> and was added to the Register on October 10, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Register Weekly List: 1984 |publisher=[[United States National Park Service]] |page=144 |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/Weekly_Register_List_1984.pdf |date=1984-10-12 |accessdate=2009-10-11 |format=PDF}}</ref> The cemetery originally owned about {{convert|110|acre|ha}} on the east side of Oakwood Avenue, but sold the land in two transactions in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].

The cemetery has about five man-made lakes and 29 miles of meandering roads creating a web of pathways on the property.]]
Oakwood is built on an [[escarpment]] that rises east of the [[plain|fluvial plain]] surrounding the [[Hudson River]], opposite the confluence of the Hudson and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]]. It is in eastern [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]], within the northeast section of the city of Troy.{{#tag:ref|A very small portion of the eastern-most section of the cemetery (on the west side of Oakwood Avenue) resides within the town of [[Brunswick, New York|Brunswick]].<ref name=nrhp25/><ref name=nrhp22>Harrison (1984), p. 22</ref>|group="n"}} Its western edge is dominated by a steep, densely vegetated hill that descends to the city below while the central and eastern portions of the cemetery comprise rolling hills graced with trees and vegetation and even include four man-made ponds created by damming mountain streams.<ref name=nrhp4/> The property is generally long and thin, running approximately north-south along Oakwood Avenue ([[New York Route 40]]).<ref name=nrhp25>Harrison (1984), p. 25</ref>

The cemetery covers {{convert|352|acre|ha}} of which {{convert|325|acre|ha}} contribute to the listing on the National Register of Historic Places. In the east-west direction, the cemetery extends from Gurley Avenue and the bed of the old Troy and Boston Railroad{{#tag:ref|In 1972 the railroad tracks were dismantled and in 1981 the bed was transformed into a scenic bicycle path called the Uncle Sam Bikeway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Uncle Sam Bikeway |publisher=Government of [[Troy, New York]] |accessdate=2009-10-07 |url=http://www.troyny.gov/recreation/unclesambikeway.html}}</ref>|group="n"}} on the west, to Oakwood Avenue on the east. The northern boundary is Fuller Road Extension and the southern boundary is a line that extends due east from a point just south of 101st Street, to Oakwood Avenue.<ref name=nrhp4>Harrison (1984), p. 4</ref>

The cemetery is split into sections for ease of finding graves which, for the most part, follow an alphabetic (e.g. Section K) or alphanumeric (e.g. Section D-3) naming system, though there are some that follow a numeric scheme.<ref name=nrhp24>Harrison (1984), p. 24</ref> The sections are split by paved and gravel roads and pedestrian paths that total {{convert|29|mi|km}}.<ref name=nrhp4/> 

There are two operating entrances to the cemetery. The main entrance is on Oakwood Avenue at the southern tip of the property;{{#tag:ref|{{Coord|42|45|10.86|N|73|40|14.24|W|region:US}}<ref name=nrhp22/>|group="n"}} it is flanked by the keeper's house.

==Landmarks==
The large amount of space in rural cemeteries permits the use of sculpture in a way that the crowded [[churchyard]] has never allowed. Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works of well known contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased.<ref name=nrhp11>Harrison (1984), p. 11</ref> Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea.<ref name=nrhp4/> Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.<ref name=nrhp13>Harrison (1984), p. 13</ref>

[[File:Giles Memorial Oakwood.JPG|thumb|left|The Giles Memorial, like many at Oakwood, incorporates benches for visitors.|alt=Short, wide memorial lined by a bench with angel statue sitting on the bench. Material is grey and central pillar depicts the name Giles.]]
Many historically important sculptors are represented on the grounds of Oakwood. [[Robert E. Launitz]], creator of the [[:File:Andrew Jackson Downing urn.jpg|memorial urn]] for [[A. J. Downing]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.&nbsp;C.]], sculpted the memorial for Major General [[George H. Thomas]] which incorporates a white marble [[sarcophagus]] topped with a [[bald eagle]].<ref name=nrhp11/> [[William Rinehart]]'s final work, a life-size sculpture of Julia Taylor Paine, resides in Oakwood.<ref name=nrhp11/> [[J.

One of the most significant monuments is that to Major General [[John E.

In 1862 the Troy Cemetery Association set aside an area in Section P, called the Soldiers' Plot, for deceased [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] officers and soldiers from [[Rensselaer County]].<ref name=nrhp13/>

===Gardner Earl Memorial Chapel and Crematorium===
[[File:OakwoodChapel.jpg|thumb|Gardner Earl Memorial Chapel and Crematorium|alt=Dark stone-faced building with tall bell tower at left. Arches connect to the main receiving rooms and chapel; roof is a slate blue color.]]
The most significant building on the property is the Gardner Earl Memorial Chapel and Crematorium, a [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] structure built between 1887 and 1889, which sits near the edge of the escarpment about {{convert|300|ft|m}} above the Hudson. The building was financed by William S. Earl, a successful Troy manufacturer, as a memorial to his son who became ill and died on a trip to [[Europe]] in March 1887.<ref name=bliss398>[http://books.google.com/books?id=HL_64rinz-EC&dq=earl%20crematorium&lr=&as_brr=1&pg=PA398#v=onepage&q=&f=false Bliss] (1897), p. 398</ref> The deceased son was an early promoter of [[cremation]]<ref name=bliss398/> and was himself cremated in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref name=cobb93>[http://books.google.com/books?id=b2kPAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22oakwood%20cemetery%22%20troy&lr=&as_brr=1&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q=&f=false Cobb] (1901), p. 93</ref> 

The building consists of a {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} [[bell tower]] with an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} square base on the south side, connected by a triple-arched [[loggia]] to a [[chapel]] and [[crematorium]] on the north side. The floor plan of the entire building measures {{convert|136|by|70|ft|m}}. The exterior is covered by a pink-tinted [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]] [[granite]] and the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] sits completely on [[bedrock]].<ref name=cobb94>[http://books.google.com/books?id=b2kPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=&f=false Cobb] (1901), p. 94</ref>

The interior is noted for its sumptuous and intricate design. The original furnace room was transformed into an elaborately designed reception room in 1889, the furnaces having been moved into a separate room. This features significant use of marble, from [[Siena]], [[Japan]], and [[Africa]], on its walls, floors, and even molding.<ref name=cobb96>[http://books.google.com/books?id=b2kPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96#v=onepage&q=&f=false Cobb] (1901), p. 96</ref> ''The Troy Daily Times'' stated on November 7, 1889, that, "the chapel is a model of architectural and mechanical skill,"<ref name=cobb94/> and that the chapel's reception room "is certainly the equal, and possibly in respect to artistic detail and elaborateness of execution, the superior of any church interior in the land."<ref name=cobb9495>[http://books.google.com/books?id=b2kPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=&f=false Cobb] (1901), pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref>

The interior of the chapel is marked by quartered oak ceilings, bluestone floors, and five original [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] [[stained glass window]]s. The [[chancel]] contains an [[onyx]] [[altar]] and [[mosaic]] floor comprised of more than twenty colors of marble.<ref name =cobb9495/>

===Warren Family Mortuary Chapel===
[[File:Warren Chapel Oakwood 2.JPG|thumb|Warren Family Mortuary Chapel|alt=Light colored, stone-faced facade with steep gabled roof and Gothic door blocked by iron gate. To the right is a tall tower topped by a cross.]]
The Warren Family Mortuary Chapel is a stone chapel built on a knoll near the center of the cemetery. It was designed by [[Henry Dudley]] of [[New York City]] and built in 1860 in the [[English Gothic architecture|English country Gothic style]], complete with a [[nave]] and [[transcept]] floor plan.<ref name=nrhp6>Harrison (1984), p. 6</ref> A tower was added in 1883, with great care placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows designed by artist [[Robert Walter Weir]] above the altar.<ref name=nrhp7>Harrison (1984), p. 7</ref> Former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] [[Joseph Mabbett Warren]] (1813<U+2013>1896) is interred in the chapel.<ref name=joewarren/>

===Vanderheyden Bell===
[[File:Earl Chapel 4.JPG|thumb|The Vanderheyden Bell seen in front of the Earl Crematorium|alt=Grassy knoll with four wood posts holding up a green copper bell to the left. Crematorium in background, with bright sun rendering much of the image shadowed.]]
The Vanderheyden Bell, a memorial itself, is located northeast of the Earl Crematorium. It is a bronze, cast bell weighing more than  {{convert|3000|lb|kg}}. Its original home was under a log shelter on the premises. At some point, it was placed into storage. In 1971 it was resurrected and hung among four [[Sequoia|redwood]] posts, becoming an additional "tower" on the property.<ref name=nrhp8>Harrison (1984), p. 8</ref>

===Mausolea===
Oakwood is home to 24 mausolea and [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vaults]] exhibiting a wide range of architectural styles including [[Greek Revival]], [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Roman Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]], and [[Palladian]].<ref name=nrhp4/> These structures are scattered throughout the grounds, some clustered, some not. They house the remains of some of Troy's wealthier and more important historical figures.

The [[:File:Oakwood Mausoleum.JPG|Cannon Mausoleum]] exemplifies a Roman temple, complete with a cross-shaped floor plan and a domed roof. The [[:File:Strope Mausoleum Oakwood.JPG|Strope Mausoleum]] is a simplified Greek Revival structure, with a bronze door in the [[Art Nouveau]] style displaying an [[angel]] surrounded by lilies. The [[:File:Tracy Mausoleum 3.JPG|Tracy Mausoleum]], incorporating the most eclectic mix of design influences on the property, has a rock-faced stone exterior covered with foliate carvings. It displays a combination of Romanesque, [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] elements, and is topped with a "[[beehive]]" roof&mdash;one of its more recognizable design features. The [[:File:Tibbits Mausoleum Oakwood.JPG|Tibbits Mausoleum]], [[:File:Oakwood 1.JPG|Vail Vault]], and [[:File:Gale Mausoleum Oakwood.JPG|Gale Mausoluem]] are all done in the Gothic Revival style. The [[:File:Kemp Mausoleum Oakwood.JPG|Kemp Mausoleum]] is the Palladian representative on site and the [[:File:Paine Mausoleum Oakwood 1.jpg|Paine Mausoleum]] is another eclectic design, octagonal in shape, and flanked by benches.<ref name=nrhp7/><ref name=nrhp15>Harrison (1984), p. 15</ref><ref name=nrhp16>Harrison (1984), p. 16</ref>

The [[:File:Russell Sage Mausoleum 3.JPG|Sage Mausoleum]], built of [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]] granite,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=8eoJAAAAIAAJ&dq=sage%20mausoleum%20oakwood&as_brr=1&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q=&f=false Richardson] (1917), p. 73</ref> exhibits obvious [[Greek architecture|Greek]] influences and is intentionally not marked. [[Russell Sage]], the wealthy financier and member of the United States House of Representatives from Troy, is interred alone; his second wife Margaret decided to be buried with her parents in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].  To the left of the memorial is a bench that contains a relief of [[Medusa]] on the center of the back, complete with snakes as hair.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oakwood Cemetery: History |publisher=Troy Cemetery Association |accessdate=2009-10-09 |url=http://www.oakwoodcemetery.org/history.php#graves}}</ref>
