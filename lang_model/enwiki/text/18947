'''Markus N<U+00E4>slund''' (born July 30, 1973) is a retired [[Sweden|Swedish]] professional [[ice hockey]] player. He previously played the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[Vancouver Canucks]] and [[New York Rangers]], as well as with [[Modo Hockey]] of [[Elitserien]] from 1990 until 2010, with the longest stretch played for the Canucks.  He is currently a member of the board for Modo Hockey.  He was nicknamed "Nazzy" by Canucks fans and is referred to as "Macke" or "Mackan" in his native Sweden.<ref>{{citeweb| url=http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article132874.ece| title=Forsberg f<U+00E5>r Flyers att lyfta 	| accessdate=2008-07-26| date=2005-12-28| language=Swedish}}</ref>

Originally drafted in the first round by the Penguins, N<U+00E4>slund was traded to Vancouver in [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1996]], where he spent twelve years, including seven as [[captain (ice hockey)|team captain]]. He was named [[Cyclone Taylor Trophy|team MVP]] five times and [[Cyrus H. McLean Trophy|led the team in scoring]] for seven consecutive seasons<U+2014>both team records<U+2014>en route to becoming the franchise leader in goals and points. In [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008]], N<U+00E4>slund signed with the Rangers, where he spent one season before announcing his retirement from the NHL on May 4, 2009.<ref name=retirement/>  In 15 NHL seasons, N<U+00E4>slund was a three-time [[NHL All-Star Team|First Team All-Star]], chosen in [[2001<U+2013>02 NHL season|2002]], [[2002<U+2013>03 NHL season|2003]] and [[2003<U+2013>04 NHL season|2004]], and a [[Lester B. Pearson Award]]-recipient, winning in 2003. He was also a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] nominee in 2003.

Internationally, N<U+00E4>slund has represented [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] on many occasions, winning two bronze medals and a silver at the [[World Ice Hockey Championships|World Championships]], as well as two silvers as a junior at the [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Championships]], where he holds the record for most goals scored in a single tournament.

==Early life==
N<U+00E4>slund was born to Ulla and Sture N<U+00E4>slund on July 30, 1973, in [[<U+00D6>rnsk<U+00F6>ldsvik]], [[Sweden]], the same town that produced childhood friend and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] star [[Peter Forsberg]], as well as N<U+00E4>slund's former Canucks teammates, [[Henrik Sedin|Henrik]] and [[Daniel Sedin]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund steps up as Canucks win fifth straight|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=221120022|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref><ref name=foe>{{cite news|last=Farber | first=Michael | title=Friend Or Foe?|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1028565/index.htm| date=2003-04-14|publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref>  

Growing up, he idolized Swedish NHL and [[Elitserien]] star [[H<U+00E5>kan Loob]].<ref name=howlong/> During his youth, he played most of his organized hockey on an outdoor rink in his neighbourhood. It is said that the team practiced as the temperature often dipped to minus-15 [[celsius]] and if it began to snow, half the team was designated to shovel, while the other half continued to play.<ref name=foe/>  By seven years old, N<U+00E4>slund and Forsberg, who were born within 10 days of each other, were well-acquainted with one another playing on separate teams. By the age of 14, the two were playing together on the same regional all-star team, helping their squad win a national championship.<ref name=foe/>  N<U+00E4>slund and Forsberg would also go on to play with each other, often on the same line, at the junior and senior level with [[Modo Hockey|Modo]] and the [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Swedish national team]].

In addition to attending the same high school together, as well, N<U+00E4>slund and Forsberg had summer jobs at the age of 18 with the same electrical company that employed N<U+00E4>slund's mother Ulla and Forsberg's father [[Kent Forsberg|Kent]].<ref name=foe/>

==Playing career==
===Early career===
N<U+00E4>slund began playing professionally at 15 years old with an <U+00D6>rnsk<U+00F6>ldsvik-based team in Sweden's third-tier league for 14 games, a stint in which he scored seven goals and 13 points. The following season, in 1989<U+2013>90, N<U+00E4>slund joined the [[Modo Hockey]] organization, playing in Sweden's highest-level junior league, the [[J20 SuperElit]], where he and [[Peter Forsberg]] formed one of the most dangerous lines in the league.<ref name=modo2005>{{citeweb |title= 2003 NHL MVP out at least eight weeks| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1971559| publisher=ESPN| date=2005-01-21| accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> After a season of junior, N<U+00E4>slund joined Modo's senior team in the Swedish [[Elitserien]] in 1990<U+2013>91. He recorded 10 goals and 19 points in his rookie season, a mark which stood as the highest points toal for a 17&nbsp;year old in the history of the league for 12 years until [[Robert Nilsson]] broke the record in 2002<U+2013>03 with 21.<ref>{{cite news|title=European prospects|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/draft/2003-06-20-euro-prospects_x.htm|accessdate=2009-08-15|date=2003-06-20|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''}}</ref>  

In the off-season, N<U+00E4>slund was drafted 16th overall in the [[1991 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Penguins general manager [[Craig Patrick]] hailed N<U+00E4>slund, along with teammate Forsberg, as the draft's two top prospects behind top selection [[Eric Lindros]]. He compared N<U+00E4>slund to [[Los Angeles Kings]] forward and fellow Swede [[Tomas Sandstr<U+00F6>m]] with the exception that "he's not as chippy,"  and claimed that he was as purer goal scorer than Penguins superstar [[Jaromir Jagr]], who had just completed his rookie year with the club.<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Penguins go European in draft for second straight year|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=au4NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b24DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6749,6357827&dq=markus+naslund|accessdate=2009-08-13|date=1991-06-24|last=McMillan|first=Tom|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''}}</ref> 

N<U+00E4>slund remained in Sweden with Modo for two more years. He recorded his first of back-to-back 39-point seasons to lead the team in scoring in 1991<U+2013>92.<ref>{{citeweb|title=1991-92 Modo Hockey Ornskoldsvik [SEL]|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0014321992.html|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=Hockeydb.com}}</ref>  The following season, he helped lead Modo to the quarter-finals of the Eliterserien playoffs.<ref name=firstgame>{{citeweb|title=Naslund comes out of retirement to join Forsberg in Sweden|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=300310|accessdate=2009-11-28|date=2009-11-28|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>  Following the 1992<U+2013>93 season with Modo, N<U+00E4>slund was set to become a free agent in the NHL. At the time, an agreement between the NHL and Swedish ice hockey officials forbade Swedish players from joining the NHL for a year unless an NHL contract was signed by July 1. With the deadline looming, N<U+00E4>slund filed a federal lawsuit in a [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] court claiming that the NHL-Swedish agreement could not override the terms of the [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) with the [[National Hockey League Players Association|NHL Players Association]] (NHLPA) that allowed him to play the upcoming season.<ref>{{cite news|title=ON PRO HOCKEY; Things Can Get Awfully Bizarre at the N.H.L.

The following season, N<U+00E4>slund only appeared in 14 games, partially due to the [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL lockout|1994<U+2013>95 labour dispute]], scoring four points.

Due to the departures of All-Star left-wingers [[Kevin Stevens]] and [[Luc Robitaille]] from the Penguins, N<U+00E4>slund was moved to left wing for the first time in his career in [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1995<U+2013>96]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Penguins hunting left-wing answers|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9VkNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=024DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6225,9486011&dq=markus+naslund|accessdate=2009-08-13|date=1995-09-14|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|last=Madden|first=Mark}}</ref>  Playing on a line with [[captain (ice hockey)|team captain]] and future [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Mario Lemieux]],<ref name=right/> N<U+00E4>slund began to improve in his third NHL season, contributing more offensively.

Near the end of the season, N<U+00E4>slund and the Canucks became the centre of attention among sports circles with the [[Todd Bertuzzi#Steve Moore incident|Steve Moore incident]].

As NHL play was set to resumed in [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06]], N<U+00E4>slund became an unrestricted free agent on August 1, 2005. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on August 3, 2005, at $6&nbsp;million per season. Vancouver newspaper ''[[The Province]]'' reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but N<U+00E4>slund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had a better chance of winning the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund staying with Canucks|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/08/03/naslund_canucks050803.html|accessdate=2009-08-16|date=2005-08-03|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> At the time, N<U+00E4>slund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.<ref name=21mil>{{citeweb|title=Agent says deal worth $21 million|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2123405|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=2005-08-03}}</ref>  

For a franchise record seventh consecutive season, he led the Canucks in scoring, with 32&nbsp;goals and 79&nbsp;points. With the new rules set in place by the NHL after the lockout, however, it was assumed by many that players like N<U+00E4>slund would thrive, especially given the Canucks' up-tempo style of play. In fact, as a line, the West Coast Express trio all suffered drops in their offensive stats in 2005<U+2013>06. Furthermore, the Canucks failed to make the playoffs for the first time in N<U+00E4>slund's tenure as team captain, finishing ninth place in the West.

As July 1 and [[free agent|free agency]] approached, N<U+00E4>slund made it clear that the style of play and the player personnel of a team would be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired.

N<U+00E4>slund had previously tried recruiting Forsberg to play for the Canucks prior to the 2007<U+2013>08 season, when Forsberg was an unrestricted free agent, without any luck.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund attempting to recruit Forsberg|url=http://www.tsn.ca/story/?id=216278|accessdate=2009-11-18|date=2007-08-16|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>  Weighing in on Forsberg's possible NHL return, N<U+00E4>slund speculated that Forsberg would remain in Sweden to continue playing for Modo.<ref name=should>{{citeweb|title=Naslund: Forsberg should play in Sweden|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/11/13/sp-naslund-forsberg-nhlpa.html|accessdate=2009-11-18|date=2009-11-13|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>  Several days later, Canucks general manager [[Mike Gillis]] confirmed N<U+00E4>slund's speculation, asserting that Forsberg intended on finishing the season with Modo.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Forsberg to play remainder of season with Modo|url=http://www.tsn.ca/story/?id=298618|accessdate=2009-11-18|date=2009-11-16|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>  The following day, on November 17, 2009, N<U+00E4>slund announced he was coming out of retirement to join Forsberg with Modo for the remainder of the [[2009<U+2013>10 Elitserien season]]. The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. A board member of the club, N<U+00E4>slund said he would play without a salary, along with Forsberg.<ref name="Rejoins Modo">{{citeweb|title=Modo<U+2019>s two musketeers back

Eleven days after the announcement, N<U+00E4>slund played in his first game back with Modo on November 28, registering an assist on the first goal of the game by Forsberg.

N<U+00E4>slund has represented [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] in numerous international hockey competitions, including two [[European Junior Ice Hockey Championships|European Junior Championships]], two [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Championships]], four [[World Ice Hockey Championships|World Championships]], two [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cups]] and one [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]], winning three silver and two bronze medals.

He made his first international appearance for Sweden at the 1990 European Junior Championships, going pointless in six games. He made a significant improvement the following year at the tournament, however, with a 14-goal and two-assist effort. N<U+00E4>slund continued to play in junior tournaments in the next two years, competing in the [[1992 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1992]] and [[1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1993 World Junior Championships]], where Sweden won back-to-back silver medals. In 1993, he set a tournament record for most goals scored with 13, to go with 11 assists, in just seven games,<ref name=worldJuniors>{{citeweb|title=Tournament records |url=http://www.worldjuniors2008.com/clanek.asp?id=2481 | accessdate=2008-06-18| work=2008 IIHF World U20 Championship| publisher=IIHF}}</ref> while playing on a line with [[Peter Forsberg]]. N<U+00E4>slund also made his senior international debut that year at the [[1993 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1993 World Championships]], where he earned another silver medal with Sweden.  

N<U+00E4>slund made his second World Championships appearance three years later at the [[1996 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1996 World Championships]]. However, he only appeared in one game for Sweden, as he was added to the team late in the tournament following the [[Vancouver Canucks]]' elimination in the [[Stanley Cup Playoffs|NHL playoffs]]. Several months later, N<U+00E4>slund competed in the inaugural [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996 World Cup]], but was again limited to one game as Sweden reached the semi-finals before falling short against Canada. Competing in his third World Championships in [[1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1999]], N<U+00E4>slund helped Sweden to a bronze medal with a 10-point effort in 10 games.  

In 2002, N<U+00E4>slund made his first and only appearance in the [[Winter Olympics|Olympics]] at the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Games]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. After going undefeated in the round-robin and heralded as gold-medal favourites, Sweden was upset by [[Belarus national men's ice hockey team|Belarus]] in the quarter-finals. The Swedish loss was widely considered one of the most stunning upsets in Olympic history, while N<U+00E4>slund described the defeat in a post-game interview as "devastating...for us and our country."<ref>{{cite news|title=Salt Lake stunner|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/20/sweden_belarus_ap/|accessdate=2009-08-15|date=2002-02-20|publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref>    Several months later, he then participated in his final World Championships in [[2002 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2002]], playing with Sweden as the host country. He was added to the roster prior to the quarterfinals following the Canucks' first-round elimination to the [[Detroit Red Wings]],<ref>{{citeweb|title=Sweden adds Naslund to world roster|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/05/03/naslund020503.html|accessdate=2009-08-15|date=2002-05-03| publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> tallying 3 points in 3 games as he earned his second consecutive bronze medal.  

Prior to the 2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout, N<U+00E4>slund participated in his final international competition at the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], where he failed to score a single goal in four games played.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/hockey/2002029510_hockey08.html | title=World Cup of Hockey: Tkachuk leads U.S. past Russia| accessdate=2008-07-25| date=2004-09-08| publisher= The Seattle Times}}</ref>  Although he was named to Team Sweden for the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/story/?id=147922 | title= Naslund, Alfredsson named to Team Sweden |date=2005-12-22| accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=TSN}}</ref> N<U+00E4>slund chose not to play due to a groin injury.<ref>{{cite news|last=The Associated Press|title=Sweden's Naslund to miss Torino Olympics|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/torino/hockey/2006-02-02-Naslund-out_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-03-10 | date=2006-02-05}}</ref>  Sweden went on to win the gold medal, defeating [[Finland national men's ice hockey team|Finland]] in the final.
