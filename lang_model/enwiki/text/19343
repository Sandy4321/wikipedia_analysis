'''Joanna of Durazzo''' (1344-20 July 1387) was the eldest daughter and eldest surviving child of [[Charles, Duke of Durazzo]] and his wife [[Maria of Calabria]], this was her first of three marriages. She succeeded as Duchess on the death of her father in 1348 when she was only a child of four years old. Joanna was a member of the [[House of Anjou]]. 

She reigned as Duchess of Durazzo<ref>[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1300.htm Women In Power (1300-1350)]</ref> from 1348-1368. She married twice firstly to [[Louis, Duke of Durazzo|Louis of Navarre]] and then on his death to [[Robert IV of Artois, Count of Eu]].

== Family ==
Joanna was the eldest daughter and second eldest child born to her parents. Her older brother Louis died in 1344, the same year Joanna was born. She had three younger siblings, all sisters: [[Agnes of Durazzo|Agnes]] wife of [[James of Baux]], Clementia who died aged seventeen in [[Naples]] and [[Margaret of Durazzo|Margaret]] who married [[Charles III of Naples]] and became consort of [[Naples]] and [[Hungary]]. Maria was born in 1329 and she gave birth to Joanna in 1344, this means Maria was only fourteen or fifteen at the birth of her daughter.

Her mother remarried twice more, her third marriage to [[Philip II, Prince of Taranto]] produced no surviving children. However her second marriage to Robert, Lord of Baux produced four children: [[Raymond III, Lord of Baux]], Francis, Lord of Aubagne, Phanette of Baux and Ettienette, Lady of Roussillon.

Joanna's maternal grandparents were [[Charles, Duke of Calabria]] and his second wife [[Marie of Valois (1309<U+2013>1332)|Marie of Valois]]. Joanna's aunt was [[Joan I of Naples]]. Her paternal grandparents were [[John, Duke of Durazzo]] and his second wife Agnes de P<U+00E9>rigord.

== Life ==
Joanna's father died in 1348 and Joanna succeeded him, being the eldest surviving child. However Joanna remained in [[Naples]] rather than going to [[Durazzo]].<ref>[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SICILY.htm#CharlesDurazzodied1348 Sicily, Medieval Lands]</ref> It was here she was betrothed to her cousin Charles Martel, son of Queen Joan. Charles Martel was heir in [[Hungary]] due to a lack of male heirs. The boy was moved to [[Hungary]], however the engagment was broken when the young boy died around 1348 in Hungary<ref>Medieval Lands</ref>.

In 1365 aged twenty one, Joanna married her first husband [[Louis, Duke of Durazzo|Louis of Navarre]], who became Duke of Durazzo in right of his wife. He was son of [[Philip III of Navarre]]. Durazzo was soon later captured by the [[Albanians]]. Joanna and her husband wished to take back Durazzo as well as the [[Kingdom of Albania]]. They received assistance from both Louis' brother and the king of France in this undertaking, for Durazzo (the remnant of the kingdom) was in the hands of [[Karl Thopia]]. In 1372, Louis brought over the Navarrese Company of mercenaries, who had fought with him during the war in [[France]], to assist them in taking Durazzo. Their ranks swelled considerably in 1375 with new recruits directly from Navarre. Many documents survive telling us of the complex nature of the military planning and engineering which was undertaken to ensure success. This they attained, taking the city in midsummer 1376. Louis died shortly after<ref>Setton, Kenneth M. (general editor) A History of the Crusades: Volume III <U+2014> The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries. Harry W. Hazard, editor. University of Wisconsin Press: Madison, 1975.</ref>. Louis and Joanna had no children. Joanna never fully regained control of Durazzo.

Around 1376 Joanna remarried to [[Robert IV of Artois, Count of Eu]]. This marriage was also childless. Robert was not Count of Eu for long, he and Joanna were not informed of his father's death in 1387. They were staying at [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in Naples where they were both poisoned<ref>[http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/kapetinger_anjou_grafen_von/neapel_linie_durazzo/johanna_von_durazzo_graefin_von_beaumont_+_1387.html Joanna of Durazzo]</ref> by their brother-in-law [[Charles III of Naples]], who had also murdered Queen Joan.

Joanna is buried in [[San Lorenzo (Naples)]]. Charles III was later murdered on the orders of [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]]. Joanna's sister Margaret had Elizabeth strangled for this act, even though Charles had murdered her own sister.
