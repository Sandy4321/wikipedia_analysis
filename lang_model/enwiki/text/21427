'''''Super Mario Bros. 2''''' (SMB2) is a [[platform game|platforming]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game console]]. It was released in North America in October [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], in Europe on [[April 28]], [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and in [[Japan]] on [[July 14]], [[1992 in video gaming|1992]]. It was re-released on the [[Wii]]'s  [[Virtual Console]] in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on [[May 25]] 2007, and in North America on [[July 2]], 2007.

''SMB2'' did not begin life as a ''Mario'' title; instead, it is a remake of the Japanese [[Famicom Disk System]] title ''[[Yume K<U+014D>j<U+014D>: Doki Doki Panic]]'' (DDP).  Nintendo's own sequel to ''Super Mario Bros.'' was released in Japan as "''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]''" in 1986. However, because of that game's extreme difficulty and its close similarity to the original game, Nintendo decided not to release it to the western world at that time, instead releasing ''DDP'' with ''Mario'' characters under the "''Super Mario Bros. 2''" label. Japan later saw the western ''SMB2'' release in 1992 under the title of {{nihongo|''"Super Mario USA"''|<U+30B9><U+30FC><U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30DE><U+30EA><U+30AA><U+FF35><U+FF33><U+FF21>(<U+30E6><U+30FC><U+30A8><U+30B9><U+30A8><U+30FC>)|S<U+016B>p<U+0101> Mario Y<U+016B> Esu <U+0112>}}. The Japanese version was released to the rest of the world as "''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels''" as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' collection for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] in 1993.

Because it was not originally a ''Mario'' title, this game differs greatly from the original ''Super Mario Bros''. However, despite its status as the [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] of the series, <ref>[http://www.gamecritics.com/review/marioadvance/main.php Super Mario Advance - GameCritics.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> many elements from ''SMB2'' have become part of the ''Mario'' series canon and the repertoire of recurring elements. The game also sold well in its own right and was critically acclaimed at the time.

==Gameplay==
Players choose from one of the four characters each time they start or restart a level: [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], and [[Princess Peach]].  ''SMB2'' is the only original ''Mario'' game, besides [[Super Paper Mario]] for the [[Wii]] where Princess Peach is not the damsel-in-distress.  She was also the first playable female character in a ''Mario'' game.  A unique ability in this game is the "power squat"; by holding Down on the control pad for a few seconds, player characters build power for higher jumps.

One of the game's most defining aspects is the ability to pluck vegetables from the ground to throw at enemies. Unlike the other ''Mario'' games, simply jumping on enemies does not accomplish anything, outside of making the player character stand on the enemy. However, enemies can also be picked up and thrown, as well as be ridden across dangerous terrain. Enemies in ''SMB2'' reappear even after being "killed"--this was changed in one of the remade versions of the game. Many enemies which first appeared in this game, such as [[Shy Guy]], would also appear in later sequels and related games.

This is the first ''Mario'' game to make use of a life meter, which allows Mario and his friends to be hit as many as four times before dying.  New power-ups and items also appear in this game. Potions, which are pulled up from the ground like vegetables, can be dropped to make a door appear. This door leads to a non-scrolling, enemy-free, and unlit "mirror-image" version of the current screen (called Sub-Space) in which the plants contain coins--used to play the [[slot machine]]-like Bonus Chance minigame at the end of each stage--rather than vegetables when uprooted.  Coins can only be collected on two visits to Sub-Space per stage; on subsequent visits pulling the plants will simply yield vegetables again.  The Super Mushrooms which add units to the player's life meter are also found in Sub-Space, and unlike in most Mario games, these super mushrooms are stationary.  Rising hearts appear after a certain number of enemies are defeated which can quickly recover a unit of depleted health to the life meter. Some vases become "warp zones" in Sub-Space, allowing the player to advance to another world (equivalent to the warp pipes in first ''SMB''.) Players can only be in Sub-Space for a limited amount of time; while in Sub-Space, the game's music changes to a reprise of the ''SMB'' theme.  [[1-up mushrooms]] may also be incidentally obtained in normal game play while plucking up vegetables, though here they appear red instead of the usual green, and "1-up" is written on their caps.

There is far more beanstalk climbing in this game than in SMB.  Additionally, new challenges are added such digging in sand for keys (guarded by a pursuing mask called "Phanto"), and bombing puzzles in which the player must drop bombs of a limited supply against multiple concrete barriers in order to complete a level.  One level forces the selected character to ascend vertically on a series of successive flying carpets which disappear after a certain amount of time.  Another requires the player to fall through a slot and then successfully avoid a series of randomly placed spikes.  Yet another relies on the player's ingenuity to ride a flying egg across the sea.

Players may obtain a Starman for invincibility as they could in SMB, but in this game they must first collect a series of five cherries (although by using a Sub-space door, it is possible a player to "collect the same cherry twice."  The fire-flower is not available, but the POW block from the game "Mario Bros" which destroyed all enemies on the screen in contact with the ground makes a reappearance, though like all other weapons, here it is thrown.  Some surfaces are guarded by electric sparks with faces, which seem to be derived from Mario's first adventure against "[[Donkey Kong]]."

Another aspect that differentiated this game from other ''Mario'' games is that there is no time limit within the stages. In addition, this was the first ''Mario'' game where players are allowed to backtrack--in the original ''SMB'', once the player had passed an area on screen, it could not be returned to.

==Story==
The plot for ''SMB2'', according to the game's manual:

<blockquote>One evening, Mario had a strange dream. He dreamed of a long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never seen before, spreading out as far as his eyes could see. When he strained his ears to listen, he heard a faint voice saying "Welcome to Sub-Con, the land of dreams. We have been cursed by [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] and we are completely under his evil spell. We have been awaiting your arrival. Please defeat Wart and return Sub-Con to its natural state. The curse Wart has put on you in the real world will not have any effect upon you here. Remember, Wart hates vegetables. Please help us!"

<p>At the same time this was heard, a bolt of lightning flashed before Mario's eyes. Stunned, Mario lost his footing and tumbled upside down. He awoke with a start to find himself sitting up in his bed. To clear his head, Mario talked to Luigi, Toad and the Princess about the strange dream he had. They decide to go to a nearby mountain for a picnic. After arriving at the picnic area and looking at the scenery, they see a small cave nearby. When they enter this cave, to their great surprise, there's a stairway leading up, up and up. It is exactly like the one Mario saw in his dream. They all walk together up the stairs and at the top, find a door just like the one in Mario's dream. When Mario and his friends, in fear, open the door, to their surprise, the world that he saw in his dream spreads out before them!</blockquote>

In the end, Mario and his friends trounce Wart and open a secret passage containing one of Sub-Con's characteristic vases. After pulling a stubborn cork from the mouth of the vase, eight red fairies spring out. The four heroes are lauded for defeating Wart, whose beaten body is passed over the crowd and tossed aside. Immediately after, the screen shows Mario snoring, indicating that the entire adventure had been a dream, making the game itself a spin-off.

===Setting===
The game takes place in a new setting, Sub-Con (derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s "[[subconscious]]"). This land is inhabited by many denizens that have since become regulars in the Mario series, such as the Shy Guys and [[Snifit]]s. [[Mario series enemies#Pidgit|Pidgit]] appears on Worlds 1-2, 3-1, and 5-3. [[Mario series enemies#Ostro|Ostro]] appears on Worlds 3 and 5 (except for 3-1 and 5-3). Cobrat and Pokey both appear in Worlds 2 and 6, and Flurry appears in World 4. This game also introduces many game-exclusive bosses, such as Pink [[Birdo]] (boss of Worlds 1-1, 1-2, and 2-1, and an appearing Birdo on World 4-3), Green Birdo (boss of Worlds 5-1, 6-1, 6-2, and 7-1), Red Birdo (boss of Worlds 2-2, 3-1, 3-2, 4-2, 5-2, 5-3, and 6-3 and an appearing Birdo on World 7-2), [[Mouser]] (boss of Worlds 1 and 3), [[Fryguy (Nintendo)|Fryguy]] (boss of World 4), [[Clawgrip]] (boss of World 5), [[Tryclyde]] (boss of Worlds 2 and 6), and most notably Wart (the final boss).  The land of Sub-Con apparently takes its name from the pixie-like inhabitants of this land (also called "Sub-Con") which have been captured by Wart.

Despite being a new land from a game not initially intended to be a ''Mario'' game, Sub-Con is not all that unlike the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Instead of brick castles and giant mushrooms, however, Sub-Con is characterized by palm trees and red-and-white vases dotting the landscape. Though it lacks any underwater stages, ''SMB2'' introduces other concepts to the series <U+2014> like grassy platforms on Worlds 1, 3, and 5 complete with [[waterfall]]s, [[desert]] stages on Worlds 2 and 6 complete with [[quicksand]] and ice stages on World 4. Level 3-1 is notable for taking place against an enormous waterfall which the heroes must ascend. Warp zone vases on World 1-3 lead to World 4, World 3-1 to World 5, World 4-2 to World 6, and World 5-3 to World 7.

''SMB2'' consists of seven "Worlds", each one containing three stages (except for World 7, which only has two). [[Level (video game)|Levels]] progress in a linear fashion, though the ability to backtrack (as mentioned above) plays a big part in some stages, including vertically-scrolling areas. Thus, many levels have sequences involving climbing or descending long distances, and the final level in particular is a large and maze-like fortress, in contrast to the linear castles found in the first ''SMB''.

This land has only been referenced once since ''SMB2''; Sub-Con is the ''Mushroom Kingdom 2'' stage in ''Super Smash Bros. Melee''.

==Playable characters==
There are four playable characters in the game, each with a score of 1-5 stars for speed, jump, and power.

*Mario - Mario is the balanced character, and thus the most user friendly of the four characters. All three stats (jump, speed, and power) are at four stars.
*Luigi - Luigi has the best jump of the lot, with a five in that category, while his speed and power are only a three. The movement control of Luigi is also very touchy.
*Toad  - Toad's speed and power are higher than anyone's, with a five in both categories. However, he is the worst jumper of the four, with only a two in that category.  Toad can also pick things up faster than anyone.  	 
*Princess (Peach) - The Princess does not excel in speed or power, with a two for both, while her jump is only a three. However, she has the ability to float in the air for a couple of seconds, making her jumping skills superior for horizontal jumps. In the remake ''Super Mario Advance'', she is called "Peach" in the character selection screen and in the credits.  She was referred to as "Princess" in the original version.

==Development==
Various Nintendo of America employees personally disliked the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', which they found to be frustratingly difficult.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Believing such a game would likely sell poorly in the United States, they wanted to release a different sequel they thought would be friendlier to western audiences. {{Fact|date=December 2007}} Although ''[[Yume K<U+014D>j<U+014D>: Doki Doki Panic]]'' was originally set in a storybook and had an Arabian theme completely unrelated to Mario, it would be modified to use [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and music that would fit with the series.

===Comparison with ''Doki Doki Panic''===
[[Image:Dokidokipanic comparison.png|right|thumb|A screenshot from ''[[Yume K<U+014D>j<U+014D>: Doki Doki Panic]]''.]][[Image:Smb2 comparison.png|right|thumb|Equivalent scene in ''Super Mario Bros. 2.'']][[Image:Dokidokimouser.png|right|thumb|Papa fighting the third version of Mouser.]]
Most of the differences between ''DDP'' and ''SMB2'' are small graphical changes, such as animation being added to the POW blocks, bomb fuses, cherries, and vegetables for the ''SMB2'' version, Super Mushrooms replacing large hearts as life-meter increases, and the characters shrinking when reduced to only one unit of health. ''DDP'' 's save feature was also taken out of ''SMB2'', due to the limitations of the NES compared to the Famicom Disk System (battery back-up was also very expensive at that time). 

Main character switches:

*Mario <U+2192> Imajin, the fearless son.
*Luigi <U+2192>  Mama.  When depicted from the side, she almost appears to be pregnant.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}Her stomach is large, and whether she is walking or jumping, she is seen with one or both arms holding and protecting her stomach.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} She doesn't, however, kick her feet when jumping as Luigi does.
*Toad <U+2192> Papa.
*Princess <U+2192> Lina, the little sister.

All abilities of the characters remain the same.

Other changes include:
*In ''DDP'', one must beat the entire game once with each character (''i.e.'' four times total) to view the ending. 
*The areas of the games referred to as Worlds in ''SMB2'' are called "Chapters" in ''DDP''.
*In ''DDP'', players cannot change characters until they defeat an end boss of a chapter. Even if they warp to a new chapter, they remain the same character until an end boss is defeated.
*Phanto (the head that chases the player's character around when holding a key) was a passive, expressionless mask in ''DDP'', whereas in ''SMB2'', he has slanted eyes with an evil, mischievous grin.  Furthermore, Phanto begins his pursuit only after the player character leaves Phanto's chamber in ''DDP'', while in ''SMB2'' he chases the character as soon as the character retrieves the key from the chamber. The "shuddering to life" sound and animation is also unique to ''SMB2''.
*Waterfalls, especially the enormous one in level 3-1, move much more quickly in ''DDP''. The animation was slowed down in ''SMB2'' to reduce the risk of seizures.
*Extra lives were originally representations of the character's face in ''DDP'' as 1-Up Mushrooms are a feature specific to the ''Mario'' series. Also, in ''DDP'', a victory jingle played when an extra life was obtained, while the "1-Up" sound was played in ''SMB2''.
*The large hawk head at level entrances and exits in ''SMB2'' was a large African tribal mask in ''DDP''.
*The mushroom blocks in ''SMB2'' were small tribal masks in ''DDP''.
*The character select and overworld music is much shorter in ''DDP''. ''SMB2'' has a new section added to where the music would originally loop.  The invincibility and Sub-Space music is different, and there are some minor differences in other songs (the ''DDP'' songs give an Arabian feel).
*Most sounds featured in ''SMB2'' use the NES' synthesizer, and a number of PCM audio samples, rather than the Famicom Disk System's synthesizer used prominently in ''DDP''. The changed audio includes the sound effects for picking up and throwing objects, grabbing hearts, receiving damage, defeating enemies, bombs exploding, the ticking of the stop watch, damaging a boss, Birdo shooting eggs, and the rocket.
*The potions in ''SMB2'' were Arabian lamps in ''DDP''.  The unused sprites for the lamp were not completely removed during the conversion and can still be found in the ''SMB2'' cartridge's memory.
*In ''DDP'', the boss of level 5-3 is a third Mouser, who requires 7 hits to defeat. In ''SMB2'', he is replaced by the rock throwing Clawgrip (whose name, incidentally, is misspelled as ''Clawglip'' in the game's credits).
*[[Albatoss]]'s animation has seven frames in ''SMB2'', but only two frames--making his flight appear much jerkier--in ''DDP''.
*As holding down the "B" button to run is a feature specific to the ''Mario'' series, there is no running in ''DDP''.
*When a bomb explodes, it says "BOM" in ''DDP'', as opposed to "BOMB" in ''SMB2''.
*The Bonus Chance minigame is similar in both versions, but has a much plainer green background in ''DDP''.
*The [[Koopa Troopa]] shell used in ''SMB2'' to kill enemies was a decapitated head in ''DDP''.
*In ''SMB2'', Wart requires 6 hits to defeat instead of the 4 required in ''DDP''.
*One of the vegetables in World 7 is different.  In ''DDP'', it's a long, slender, grouchy vegetable, while on ''SMB2'', it's a heart-shaped feminine vegetable.
*Birdo has more color variations in ''DDP''.

==Enhanced remakes==
[[Image:Smb2allstars.PNG|thumb|190px|The game experienced an enhanced remake on the SNES in ''Super Mario All-Stars''.]]

===[[Super Mario All-Stars]]===
''SMB2'' received a graphical, audio, and gameplay upgrade when it was re-released in ''Super Mario All-Stars'' for the Super NES. 

Notable changes between the original NES version and the ''Super Mario All-Stars'' version include:
*In the NES version of ''SMB2'', after losing their last life, the player can only continue twice, while in the ''Super Mario All-Stars'' version, a player can continue any number of times, because it's possible to continue from a saved game. 
*In ''Super Mario All-Stars'', the screen splits into two after the Title, Player Select, Bonus Chance, and Warp screens. 
*In the ''Super Mario All-Stars'' version of the Bonus Chance game, the icons are bigger and the player can get up to 10 extra lives (as opposed to 5 in the NES version)
*In the NES version of ''SMB2'', after the player selects a character, they must play as that character until the end of that level, while in ''Super Mario All-Stars'', the player can select a character at the beginning of each level and after losing a life. 
*When you warp to another world in the NES version, the screen changes abruptly (due to graphical restrictions), but in ''Super Mario All-Stars'', the door to exit Subspace disappears and the screen [[Pixelization|blurs]], fades to the next screen, and then refocuses.
*Super Mario Bros. USA, together with Super Mario Bros. 2, and its Super Mario All Stars counterpart reverts Birdo as Ostro, and Ostro as Birdo (This can be evidenced in the ending, where all characters appears). However, this was corrected in future versions of the games, like Super Mario Advance.

===BS Super Mario USA===
There was also a remake similar to the [[Super Mario All-Stars]] version for the [[Satellaview]] in 1997 titled ''BS Super Mario USA''. The game was released in five parts (or chapters). Like most other games released for this peripheral, this one uses a "Live Voice" feature, in which a narrator occasionally appears to give some comments and hints. This feature, as well as the game's music, could only be heard during the Satellaview's broadcasting hours.

While the game itself is largely the same, there were some new and arranged content. For instance, there is now a score. Also, at first, only Mario is playable, and depending on the time, some specific event will trigger, including the possibility to play with the other characters. Another feature is the inclusion of gold statues (ten in total for each chapter), which are hidden in several locations (including Sub-Space) that grant the player an extra life and refills the life meter. After clearing a level, the player could press "Select" to see some statistics, such as statues, coins, cherries and mushrooms collected, as well as display which bosses were defeated.

===Super Mario Advance===
[[Image:25 - Super Mario Advance (U).png|150px|right|thumb|Super Mario Advance box art.]]
''SMB2'' received another enhanced remake as ''Super Mario Advance'', the first ''Mario'' title for the [[Game Boy Advance]], which also contained a remake of ''[[Mario Bros]]''. This version was developed by [[Nintendo Research & Development 2|Nintendo R&D2]]. It included several graphic and sound enhancements in the form of enlarged sprites, multiple hit combos, and digital voice acting.  For the first time ever on Nintendo's part was a system devised to score this game. Two notable additions are the new character, [[Robirdo]], a robotic Birdo who acts as the boss of the third world, and the [[Yoshi]] Challenge, which encourages players to revisit stages and search for Yoshi eggs. 

Nintendo's decision to choose it as the Game Boy Advance launch game was seen by some as misguided; GameSpot in particular thought that ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' or ''[[Super Mario World]]'' would have been a far better choice for a launch title considering their popularity.<ref>Ahmed, Shahed. [http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/supermarioadvance/review.html Super Mario Advance for the Game Boy Advance review].  [[June 5]], [[2001]].</ref> (Both of those titles would eventually be remade as part of the ''Advance'' series.)  However, IGN praised the choice, calling it "one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era." <ref>Nix, Marc. [http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165853p1.html Super Mario Advance review].  [[June 14]], [[2001]].</ref> Nonetheless, it was a best-selling launch game, showing that the game still appealed to [[Nintendo]] fans. Recently, the game has become part of the [[Player's Choice]] lineup for Game Boy Advance as one of the system's first 3 Player's Choice games (along with ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Advance 3]]'').

====Voice Cast====
*[[Charles Martinet]] - [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Mouser]], [[Fryguy]], [[Clawgrip]], [[Tryclyde]], [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]]
*[[Jen Taylor]] - [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], [[Princess Peach]], Pink/Red/Green [[Birdo]], [[Robirdo]]

== Super Smash Bros. Melee stage ==
In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', there was a stage in which there was a waterfall in the middle, and two small parts on land to the right and left. It had the backround as the same graphics as ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' as well as a pigeon on a carpet that flies around and can transport players around the stage. There's also a Birdo that shoots eggs at players from one of the two parts of land. The waterfall doesn't pull players down, but sometimes logs travel down there which do.

==Reception==
Upon release, the game was highly successful, and currently stands as the third highest selling game ever released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, with over 10 million copies sold.  Only the original Super Mario Bros, at 40 million, and ''[[Super Mario Brothers 3]]'', at 18 million, sold more on the original NES. However, the game was deemed the ninth worst ''Mario'' game of all time by [[ScrewAttack]], citing that it wasn't actually a ''Mario'' game, but the Japanese game ''Doki Doki Panic'' "with Mario's world slapped all on it", making the whole game "feel like a lie".<ref>{{cite web |title=ScrewAttack - Top Ten Worst Mario Games |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/23547.html |date=2007-07-21| publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>  However, ScrewAttack's sensationalist opinion is shared by a very small minority of Super Mario Bros. fans.

==Impact on popular culture==
[[Image:SSBM-Mario2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|This homage to ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' appeared in ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' in the form of a playable stage.]] Because ''SMB2'' differed so much in the game mechanics and overall feel of the ''Mario'' series, some gamers and professional critics have come to regard ''SMB2'' as the black sheep of the ''Mario'' games.<ref>[http://www.gamecritics.com/review/marioadvance/main.php Super Mario Advance - GameCritics.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Even so, due to its unique style of gameplay and set in a completely different world, ''SMB2'' has made a continuous impact on the entire ''Mario'' series. Notable examples include:

*Bob-ombs (most of them tamer) were included in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros]]''.  Virtous bob-ombs appeared in ''[[Super Mario 64]].''
*Ninjis and Pokeys were included in ''[[Super Mario World]]''.  Pokeys were also included in ''[[New Super Mario Bros]]''.
*Shyguys are a major enemy in ''[[Yoshi's Story]]''.
*Birdo, Snifits, and Shyguys appear in ''[[Super Mario RPG]].''
*Pidget appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]''
*Sand-digging and vegetable-tossing would again be implemented in specially packaged e-Reader cards for the Game Boy Advance version of ''[[Super Mario Bros 3]]''.
*The concept of hiding secret passageways to useful items through quicksand pits was implemented again in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and again in ''New Super Mario Bros.''
*The concept of the "bombing puzzle" reappeared in ''New Super Mario Bros.''
*Ridable enemies such as ostros and albatosses in ''SMB2'' preceded other enemies that could be ridden, such as the para-buzzy beetles of ''SMB3.''
*The desert sun enemy from ''SMB3'' bears a striking resemblance in both appearance and movement to the key guardian Phanto from ''SMB2.''  
*Mouser and Wart were referenced in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''.
*Wart makes an appearance in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'' under his Japanese name, Mamu.
*''SMB2'' has also been referenced in a variety of non-video-game media featuring Mario:  Many elements, enemies, and sounds from the game showed up regularly on ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'' cartoon episodes. Although Wart did not make an appearance, King Koopa's character looked similar to him, and Princess Toadstool's (Peach) red hair color and lack of white gloves in the game sprites may have influenced her cartoon design.
*The game's elements were utilized generously in the Super Mario Bros. comic books, published as part of the [[Nintendo Comics System]] by [[Valiant Comics]]
*Snifits and a Bob-omb were featured in [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|the ''Super Mario Bros.'' movie]]. References to other creatures originating from ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', such as Ostro and Fryguy, can also be found in the film.
*The theme song was sampled by the ''Ambassadors of Funk'' for the song ''Supermario USA'', included on the album [[Super Mario Compact Disco]].
*In both Animal Crossing games, a possible resident in player's villages is Wart Jr, a likely reference to Wart, one of the Bosses in ''SMB2''.
*Various ROM hackers have striven and successfully created fan games that integrate the enemies and game mechanics of ''Super Mario Bros 2'' together with those of ''SMB'' and ''SMB3''.
