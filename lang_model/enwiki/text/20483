'''Jack Wall''' is an [[United States|American]] [[video game music]] [[composer]]. He has worked on video game music for over 20 games including the [[Myst (series)|''Myst'' franchise]], ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow|Splinter Cell]]'', ''[[Jade Empire]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect]]''. Wall earned a degree in [[civil engineering]] from [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and, after a brief stint working in civil engineering, transitioned into music production. He worked with musicians such as [[John Cale]], [[David Byrne]], and [[Patti Smith]], and, after performing increasingly complex production and sound engineering tasks, moved into music composition in 1995.

Wall immediately began working in the video game industry, composing the soundtrack to ''[[Vigilance (video game)|Vigilance]]''. Primarily composing in an orchestral style, by 2001 he composed the soundtrack to ''[[Myst III: Exile]]'', which was the title he says put him on the map as a video game composer. In 2002, Wall became one of around 20 co-founders of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) as well as senior director. In 2005, Wall, along with G.A.N.G. founder and fellow composer [[Tommy Tallarico]], produced the [[Video Games Live]] concert series. Wall serves as the [[conducting|conductor]] for the international concert tour. His latest released soundtrack is that of 2010's ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. His soundtracks for ''Myst III: Exile'', ''[[Myst IV: Revelation]]'', ''[[Rise of the Kasai]]'', ''Jade Empire'', and ''Mass Effect'' have been nominated for and won multiple awards.

==Early life==
Jack Wall, born in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]], earned a degree in [[civil engineering]] from [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and began a career "planning out sub-divisions and shopping malls".<ref name="born"/><ref name="IGNint"/> At the same time he was in a rock band, as he was also interested in music. After recording a demo tape with the band, he was inspired to change career paths and quit his job to work in the music industry. He initially worked as a bartender and later started working in recording studios in Philadelphia and later [[Boston]] and [[New York City]], where he worked for Skyline Studios. In 1991 Wall left Skyline, and until 1994 worked as an independent music producer and sound engineer in New York City, working with musicians such as [[John Cale]], [[David Byrne]], and [[Patti Smith]], as well as local bands. Over those three years, Wall consistently worked with Cale, eventually handling arrangement and orchestration of Cale's compositions as well as producing and working as a sound engineer. While working with Cale on the soundtrack to a movie, ''House of America'', he watched as Cale composed thirty minutes of music in almost real time, and was inspired to begin composing music.<ref name="IGNint"/>

==Career==
[[File:Video Games Live concert 2008.jpg|thumb|October 24, 2008 ''Video Games Live'' performance with Wall as the conductor]]
By late 1995, Jack Wall was living in Los Angeles and was married to singer Cindy Shapiro, who he had met in 1994.<ref name="SHAPIRO"/><ref name="IGNint"/> She knew Ron Martinez, who was starting a video game company, PostLinear Entertainment, and he asked Wall to work for it as a composer.<ref name="Postlin"/><ref name="IGNint"/> He composed the soundtracks for several games for PostLinear; the first released was ''[[Vigilance (video game)|Vigilance]]'' in 1997.<ref name="IGNint"/> His daughter Gracie was also born early in 1997.<ref name="JWGracie"/> After leaving the company, he composed the soundtrack to 2001's ''[[Myst III: Exile]]'', which was his first orchestral score and the work that he said put him on the map as a video game composer. It was also interesting to him, as it was a sequel to the first video game he had ever played, ''[[Myst]]''.<ref name="IGNint"/> ''Myst III'' was nominated for the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] "[[Interactive Achievement Award#Original Music Composition|Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition]]" award, which it lost to the ''[[Tropico]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="AIAS2002"/>

In 2002, Wall became one of around 20 co-founders of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) as well as senior director.<ref name="JWabout"/><ref name="GANGabout"/> The group works to promote the appreciation of video game music, as well as serve as a professional resource for video game music composers and musicians. It was developed and headed by [[Tommy Tallarico]].<ref name="GANGabout"/> As of 2010, Wall serves as vice chairman, after stepping down from heading the board of directors in 2007.<ref name="JWabout"/><ref name="GSGANG"/> He continued to compose soundtracks for games such as ''[[The Mark of Kri]]'' and ''[[Unreal II: The Awakening]]''. His work on ''[[Myst IV: Revelation]]'' in 2004 earned him his first three awards, those of "Best Live Performance Recording", "Best Original Vocal Song: Choral", and "Music of the Year" from the G.A.N.G. awards.<ref name="GANG2004"/>

Wall, along with Tommy Tallarico, has produced the ''[[Video Games Live]]'' concert series, which began on July 6, 2005. The two had been planning the concert series, which presents orchestrated versions of music from dozens of games, for three years.<ref name="postgazette"/> The concerts consist of segments of video game music performed by a live orchestra with video footage and synchronized lighting and effects, as well as several interactive segments with the audience, conducted by Wall.<ref name="wapo"/> ''Video Games Live'' was intended to take the idea of a symphonic video game music concert, which was popular in Japan, and combine it with a rock concert to make it appealing to western fans.<ref name="SGint"/> The series is international and ongoing, with more than 70 shows planned for 2009.<ref name="variety"/> Although Wall composed the soundtracks to four games released in 2005 including the award-winning score to ''[[Jade Empire]]'', his only works released since then have been 2007's ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and 2010's ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. ''[[Mass Effect]]''{{'}}s score earned Wall several awards and nominations.<ref name="GANG2007"/><ref name="IGN2007"/>

==Musical style and influences==
Although many of his works are orchestral, Jack Wall has worked in a wide variety of styles, including "heavy metal meets orchestral" and "tribal percussion".<ref name="TAXIint"/> For ''Jade Empire'', he focused on using Chinese instruments and [[Taiko]] drums.<ref name="IGNint3"/> When writing a video game score, Wall prefers a collaborative approach with the game designers to creating the music, as he feels that the "tug back and forth of ideas" makes the music stronger. He notes, however, that he has to be flexible, and willing to create his own vision for the music. As part of this, he prefers to be able to see illustrations and game design documents before beginning, as they provide insight into the feel of the game so that his music can mesh in with it.<ref name="IGNint2"/> He also believes that a good video game music composer needs to have a lot of technical sound production skill to be successful.<ref name="TAXIint"/> Wall has said that the ''Myst'' and ''Mass Effect'' soundtracks are his favorites that he has created. Wall stated that he was primarily interested in scoring games that are "interesting", and that his main concern was creating something original.<ref name="SGint"/> Although he has worked with live orchestras and synthetic orchestras, Wall recommends that game developers use a live one, despite the expense, as he feels they add a much more dynamic sound to the music and allow the composer more freedom than synthesizer samples.<ref name="JWOrch"/>
