The iPhone 4S was unveiled at Apple's "Let's Talk iPhone" event on October 4, 2011 in [[Cupertino, California]]. The keynote was the first in which [[Tim Cook]] led since the Verizon keynote earlier in the year. It was also Cook's first product launch without Apple co-founder, [[Steve Jobs]], whose health was deteriorating and died the day after the announcement of iPhone 4S. Tim Carmody of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' praised Cook for focusing on company achievements, calling him a "global business thinker" and a "taskmaster".<ref>{{cite news |title=Less Flash, More World Domination: Apple's Tim Cook Era Begins|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/10/keynote-tim-cook/ |author=Carmody, Tim |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]] | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 5, 2011}}</ref>

===Hardware===
[[File:IPhone4SiPhone4.png|thumb|left|250px|alt=An iPhone 4 on top of an iPhone 4S.|Comparison between iPhone 4 hardware (top) and iPhone 4S hardware (bottom). Notice the repositioned antennae (the visible stainless steel which forms the perimeter around the phone).]]

The iPhone 4S has a [[stainless steel]], dual-antenna design. Apple redesigned the antenna in the iPhone 4S so that the cellular radio in the phone can alternate between two antennas, depending on which is sending/receiving the best signal. These two antennas form part of the stainless steel band that covers the sides of the iPhone 4 and 4S.<ref name="PC World">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/241186/new_iphone_4s_antenna_death_grip_now_slightly_harder.html | title=New iPhone 4S: Antenna 'Death Grip' Now Slightly Harder | work=[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]] | publisher = [[IDG]] | author = Sullivan, Mark  | date=October 5, 2011 | accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref> The bands on the iPhone 4S are divided into four antennas, [[cellular network|cellular]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], and [[Wi-Fi]].<ref name="apple" />

In both the iPhone 4 and 4S, the cellular (GSM) antenna is divided into two. Therefore, if the iPhone 4S is gripped in such a way as to attenuate one piece of the cellular antenna, the radio will switch to the other piece that isn't being gripped.<ref name="PC World" /> The iPhone 4S can support a maximum output theoretically of up to 14.4 [[data rate units#Megabit per second|Mbps]] with [[HSDPA]] as a result of an upgraded radio chip inside the phone, in addition to being a [[world phone]], so both [[CDMA]] and [[GSM]] customers can roam internationally on GSM networks.<ref name=chaffin>{{cite web | url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_announces_iphone_4s_new_antenna_better_battery/ | title=Apple Announces iPhone 4S: New Antenna, 64GB Capacity (Update) | author = Chaffin, Bryan | work=c | date=October 5, 2011 | accessdate=October 5, 2011}}</ref> It also supports [[Bluetooth]] 4.0.<ref name="4S" />

The camera on the iPhone 4S, also known as an [[iSight]] camera, can take 8 MP photos (3264 by 2448 pixels) and record 1080p videos at up to 30 [[frames per second]] with upgraded quality<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tideart.com/?id=4e9dc842|title= iPhone 4S camera comparisons compilation|work=TideArt|author=Lambert, Patrick|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref> (30% better clarity, 26% better white balance, color accuracy) due to an additional lens, [[IR filter]], a wider f/2.4 aperture, and ''Image signal processor'' (built-in A5).<ref name="chaffin" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/why-the-improve-camera-in-the-iphone-4s-is-good-news-for-shutterbugs.ars|title=Why the improved camera in the iPhone 4S is good news for shutterbugs|publisher=Ars Technica|author=Foresman, Chris|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref>

The camera can now be accessed directly from the lock screen, and the volume up button doubles as a shutter trigger. The built-in [[gyroscope]] is able to stabilize the camera while recording video. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being able to take its first picture in 1.1&nbsp;seconds and the next half a second later.<ref name=gizmodo>{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5846504/new-apple-iphone-all-the-information|title=New Apple iPhone 4S: All the Information|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=April 24, 2012|author=Diaz, Jesus}}</ref><ref name="chaffin" />

Like the [[iPhone 4]], the {{convert|3.5|in|mm}} 960 by 640 [[pixel]] Retina display supports [[multitouch]], a technology that allows multiple simultaneous touch inputs.

The lock/power button is situated on the top right edge of the device.<ref name="apple" /> The right side of the device is devoid of inputs except for a [[SIM card]] slot. The bottom of the device features a speaker output on the right and a microphone input on the left with Apple's proprietary 30-pin dock connector in the center.<ref name="apple" /> The top left on the back of the device houses an 8 [[megapixel]] f/2.4 [[aperture]] camera with an [[LED]] flash. The iPhone 4S supports video out via [[AirPlay]] and various Apple A/V cables.<ref name="chaffin" /> Supported video formats include such as H.264 (1080p 30 fps max.), MPEG-4 video, and [[motion JPEG]] (M-JPEG).<ref name="chaffin" />

In addition to user inputs, the device also has several sensors that give the phone information about its orientation and external conditions.  These include a 3-axis gyro, an accelerometer, a proximity sensor, and an ambient light sensor.<ref name="4S" /> The iPhone 4S is stated to have 200&nbsp;hours standby time ([[iPhone 4]] 300 hours), 8&nbsp;hours talk time on 3G (iPhone 4<U+2013>7 hours), 14&nbsp;hours talk time on 2G, 6&nbsp;hours 3G browsing, and 9&nbsp;hours [[Wi-Fi]] browsing.<ref name=4S>{{cite web|title=Apple iPhone 4S|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name="chaffin" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Apple iPhone 4|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4/specs.html|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}</ref>  Additionally, it can sustain up to 10 hours of video playback or 40 hours of audio playback.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple iPhone 4S|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>

The iPhone 4S has a dual-core [[Apple A5]] processor,<ref name="chaffin" /><ref name="enbencha5">{{cite web | url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/11/benchmarks-clock-iphone-4s-a5-cpu-at-800mhz-show-major-gpu-upg/ | title=Benchmarks clock iPhone 4S' A5 CPU at 800MHz, show major GPU upgrade over iPhone 4 | publisher=[[AOL]] | work=[[Engadget]] | date=October 11, 2011 | accessdate=May 02, 2012 | author=Toor, Amar}}</ref> compared to the one-core [[Apple A4]] processor used in the [[iPhone 4]]. It has 512 MB of [[random-access memory|RAM]], the same as its predecessor.<ref name="ifixit-teardown" /> Maximum available storage size increased to 64 GB whilst the 32 GB and 16 GB model options were retained. The screen is the same as the prior generation iPhones; {{convert|3.5|in|mm}}, 640<U+00D7>960 resolution (Apple's "retina" design).<ref name="chaffin" /> The improvement in interactive multimedia applications was obvious compared to its predecessor.<ref name="gizmodo" />

===Software===
The iPhone 4S uses the Apple A5 system-on-a-chip that uses an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX graphics processing unit, which features pixel, vertex, and geometry shader hardware, supporting [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0. The SGX543 is an improved version of the GPU used in the iPhone 4S' predecessor, the iPhone 4. However, the iPhone 4S uses a dual-core model, the SGX543, that is integrated with the Apple A5 SoC in the same way as the iPad 2.<ref name="techradar 4s gaming">{{cite web

The iPhone 4S introduced a new automated voice control system called "[[Siri (software)|Siri]]", unique to the 4S,<ref name="gizmodo" /> that allows the user to give the iPhone commands, which it can execute and respond to. For example, iPhone commands such as "What is the weather going to be like?" will generate a response such as "The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54&nbsp;degrees today". These commands can vary greatly and control almost every section of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with [[natural language processing|natural language]]. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for an extra amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as pointed out by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier and/or possible for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full.<ref name="vangrove" /> It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.<ref name="vangrove" />

Siri is supported by the A5 chip and is currently a feature only available on the iPhone 4S.<ref name="gizmodo" /> Siri also needs [[Internet access]] to function.<ref name="4S" /> When used for the first time, Siri does not require setup but does adapt to a user's voice over time, and can also be taught certain things directly.<ref name="neil" /> A number of aspects of the software can be configured, such as language and its voice feedback ability (its ability to talk back).<ref name="neil" />

At launch Apple said Siri is still in [[betaware|beta]], and it has a certain set of abilities with restrictions, such as being able to dictate texts but not emails, and only controlling certain apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-what-can-you-say-to-siri/|title=iPhone 4S: What can you say to Siri?|author=Sadun, Erica|accessdate=October 5, 2011|work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|publisher=[[AOL]]}}</ref> Nevertheless one area it may be useful is driving and exercise activities.<ref name="gizmodo" /> It is integrated with Apple's [[Find My Friends]] program (which debuted at the same time as the 4S), so Siri can potentially answer questions like "Where is my wife?"<ref name=neil>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/10/inside_apples_iphone_4s_s_is_for_siri_voice_recognition.html|title=Inside Apple's iPhone 4S: 'S' is for Siri voice recognition|author=Neil Hughes|accessdate=October 10, 2011|work=[[AppleInsider]]|publisher=AppleInsider}}</ref> When it is enabled, Apple's Find My Friends lets a social group know where each other are and Siri can use this information to answer questions.<ref name="neil" /> Siri can be taught information, so it knows who a person is referring to when they use generic terminology on that device.<ref name="neil" />

On the iPhone 4S, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which allows speech-to-text.<ref name="vangrove" />  In addition to regular texting, messaging on the iPhone 4S is supported by [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. iMessages are in blue, and regular texts in green in the screen bubbles. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software as well as a spell checker, that includes many regional dialects like Swiss spoken French.<ref name="4S" /> Since Siri can send text messages, a person can text and drive without taking their eyes off the road, as shown in Apple's video ad.<ref name="vangrove" /> Another example is that a person can ask Siri for information while they are cooking and their hands are messy.<ref name="vangrove" /> It also makes it much easier for people with physical disabilities such as blindness to compose and send text messages.<ref name="vangrove" />

At announcement plans were in place for the iPhone 4S to support many languages from around the world. Different features have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell-checker, which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch.<ref name="neil" /> Since it uses a software based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different [[keyboard layout]]s without having to change physically. The iPhone 4S can display different languages and scripts at the same time.<ref name="chaffin" />

The device is a [[world phone]] and can work on both GSM & CDMA networks.<ref name="chaffin" /> On a 2G (on GSM) network it supports up to 14 hours of talk time.<ref name="chaffin" /> It can download at maximum rate of 14.4&nbsp;[[megabit per second|Mbps]] on a [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] network such as AT&T Mobility's. However, on CDMA networks, such as Verizon Wireless, it is limited to 3.1&nbsp;Mbit/s.<ref name="chaffin" />

iPhone 4S was announced with [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] iOS 5 operating system, which Apple claims as having over 200 new features compared to the prior version. On the iPhone 4S, the Apple A5 processor and iOS 5 work together to support many subsystems of the device, such as data processing for the camera. Some major tasks performed include browsing the internet with [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], voice assistance with [[Siri (software)|Siri]], cellular communications, media playback, and applications. It supports PC and Mac freedom, where updates can be downloaded by [[wireless|over-the-air]] to the device.<ref name=wiredlive>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/10/apple-iphone-5-live-blog|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]]|title=Apple iPhone 5 Live Blog|accessdate=October 4, 2011|first=Christina|last=Bonnington|date=October 4, 2011}}</ref> Another feature is the ability to have Apple send a real card in the mail with the Apple [[Cards (iOS)|Cards]] application.<ref name="wiredlive" />

Further, the iPhone 4S' ability to process 30 million [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] per second has been compared to the [[PlayStation 3]] and the Xbox 360 home [[video game console]]s that can process 275 million and 500 million polygons per second respectively.<ref name="techradar 4s gaming" />

''[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]''<nowiki />'s deputy editor Andy Robinson told [[TechRadar]] that the "[iPhone 4S] is certainly laying down some serious credibility for the iPhone as a core gaming device. Not only is it now pushing out games that simply eclipse the [Nintendo 3DS] visually, but features like [[cloud computing|cloud saving]] and [[streaming media|TV streaming]] support are really exciting for gamers."<ref name="techradar 4s gaming" /> The senior gaming analyst at Jon Peddie Research, Ted Pollak, believes the biggest improvement to gaming on the iPhone 4S is the [[Siri (software)|voice control]] features, noting that "one of the features that [[Nintendogs]] players loved was the ability to talk to it. There's no reason why a game like that couldn't be done on the iPhone 4S, and much more sophisticated given the voice control shown."<ref>{{cite web
