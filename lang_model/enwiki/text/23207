'''Peter Foster Causey''' ([[January 11]] [[1801]] &ndash; [[February 17]] [[1871]]) was an [[United States |American]] [[merchant]] and [[politician]] from [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]], in [[Sussex County, Delaware |Sussex County]], [[Delaware]]. He was a member of the [[Know-Nothing movement |American Party]], who served in the [[Delaware General Assembly]] and as [[Governor of Delaware]]. 

==Early Life and Family==
Causey was born [[January 11]] [[1801]] in [[Bridgeville, Delaware |Bridgeville]], [[Delaware]], son of Peter T. and Tamzey Causey. His family lived in [[Easton, Maryland |Easton]], [[Maryland]] for a time, but returned to [[Delaware]] in 1815, settling on North Walnut Street in [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]]. He married Maria Williams and they had six children, William F., Maria E., Sally Maria, Peter Foster, Jr., John W., and Robert H. In 1850 they bought the old Levin Crapper mansion, former home of [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]] [[Daniel Rogers]]. It was subsequently known as the ''Causey Mansion.'' The Causey family owned a large flour mill and were successful merchants, taking advantage of the many business opportunities in [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]] at the time. They were members of the First [[United Methodist Church |Methodist Church]] in [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]].

==Political career==
[[Image:PeterCausey2.jpg|left|150px]]
In the constantly shifting political combinations of the time, Causey began his career as a progressive Jacksonian [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democrat]], and was elected to the [[Delaware House of Representatives |State House]] in the 1831 session and the 1832/33 session. As the [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democrats]] lost their progressive agenda, and with the collapse of the [[Whig Party (United States) |Whig Party]], most of the energy in opposition to the increasingly conservative [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democrats]] came from the Temperance movement. In 1850 a Temperance candidate was almost elected, and in 1854 Causey signed on as their candidate under the aegis of the [[Know-Nothing movement |American Party]]. This was a unusual combination of various causes that in [[Delaware]] was headed by prohibition. He was elected [[Governor of Delaware]] in 1854, defeating [[William Burton (governor) |William Burton]], the [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democratic]] candidate and served from [[January 16]] [[1855]] until [[January 18]] [[1859]]. 

Along with Causey several "Know-Nothings," as they were known, were elected to the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]]. Proceeding with their Prohibition agenda, they passed legislation that went fully into effect by December 1855. By Election Day 1856, the effects of this legislation were detested enough by the voters that they replaced nearly all the "Know-Nothings" with [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democrats]], and leaving Causey two years to govern with a strong [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democratic]] opposition in the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]]. Needless to say, the repeal of the prohibition laws was foremost on their agenda.

Other than the prohibition matter the most important issue in [[Delaware]] at the time was the completion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad |Delaware Railroad]]. By September 1855 it was complete to [[Middletown, Delaware |Middletown]], and by January 1857 all the way to [[Delmar, Delaware |Delmar]]. On the other side of the ledger, by 1861 [[University of Delaware |Delaware College]] was forced to close due to a lack of funds, aggravated by a brutal unsolved murder on the campus.

A true reformer, Causey hammered the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] on all the same issues his predecessors had been speaking about for years. <blockquote>"The existing public schools, he said, were dilapidated and the teachers untrained. [Public education] has been the theme of much debate in our legislative halls for years, he remarked, and yet each succeeding session has ended in little or no alteration for the better. The tiny school districts run by committees elected by the residents most hostile to taxation simply were not working. [Furthermore, the insane], more than any other portion of our community, [were] dependent upon our care and protection." <ref>{{cite book |author=Hoffecker, Carol E |title=Democracy in Delaware |publisher= |year= |id=}}, p. 96; quotation from the ''Journal of the House of Representatives (1859), p. 9-22</ref></blockquote>

The 68th and 69th [[Delaware General Assembly]] sat during Causey<U+2019>s term of office. The 68th [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] met in 1855/56 and had a [[Know-Nothing movement |American Party]] majority in both houses. The 69th [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] met in 1857/58 and had a [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democratic]] majority in both houses.

==Death and Legacy==
Causey died [[February 17]] [[1871]] at [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]], [[Delaware]], and is buried at Old Methodist Episcopal Cemetery, at North and 3rd Street in [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]]. 

==Public offices==
Elections were held the first Tuesday in October until 1831, and since they have been held on the first Tuesday after November 1st. Members of the [[Delaware General Assembly]] took office in the first Tuesday of January. [[Delaware House of Representatives |State Representatives]] have a term of two years. The [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]] takes office the third Tuesday in January, and has a four year term.
