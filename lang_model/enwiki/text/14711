[[File:Pierre Monteux, Conductor of the Ballets Russes (c1911-1914) - Gallica.jpg|thumb|280px|Monteux during his conductorship of Les Ballets Russes, c. 1912]]
'''Pierre Benjamin Monteux''' ({{IPA-fr|pj<U+025B><U+0281> m<U+0254><U+0303>.t<U+00F8>|pron}}; 4 April 1875{{spaced ndash}}1 July 1964){{refn|group=n|Monteux disliked the name Benjamin and formally dropped it when he took American citizenship in 1942.<ref>Monteux (1964), p. 26</ref>}} was a French (later American) [[conducting|conductor]]. After violin and [[viola]] studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' and other prominent works including ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>]]'', and [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Jeux]]''. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century.

From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York. He led the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] (1919<U+2013>24), [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra]] (1924<U+2013>34), [[Orchestre Symphonique de Paris]] (1929<U+2013>38) and [[San Francisco Symphony]] (1936<U+2013>52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records.

Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in [[Les Baux-de-Provence|Les Baux]] in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded [[Pierre Monteux School|a school]] for conductors and orchestral musicians in [[Hancock, Maine]]. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were [[Igor Markevitch]], [[Neville Marriner]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Previn]], [[Lorin Maazel]] and [[Seiji Ozawa]]. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Pierre Monteux was born in Paris, the third son and the fifth of six children of Gustave <U+00C9>lie Monteux, a shoe salesman, and his wife, Cl<U+00E9>mence Rebecca ''n<U+00E9>e'' Brisac.<ref name=c20>Canarina, p. 20</ref> The Monteux family was descended from [[Sephardic]] Jews who settled in the south of France.<ref>Canarina, p. 19</ref> The Monteux ancestors included at least one [[rabbi]], but Gustave Monteux and his family were not religious.<ref name=m18>Monteux (1965), pp 18<U+2013>19</ref> Among Monteux's brothers were Henri, who became an actor, and Paul, who became a conductor of light music under the name Paul Monteux-Brisac.<ref>Canarina, pp. 20 (Paul) and 148 (Henri)</ref> Gustave Monteux was not musical, but his wife was a graduate of the Conservatoire de Musique de Marseille and gave piano lessons.<ref name=c20/>  Pierre took violin lessons from the age of six.<ref name=c20/>

[[File:Theatre du Conservatoire Paris CNSAD.jpg|thumb|left|The building which housed the Paris Conservatoire in Monteux's student days (21st century photograph)]]
When he was nine years old Monteux was admitted to the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. He studied the violin with [[Jules Garcin]] and Henri Berthelier, composition with Charles Lenepveu, and harmony and theory with [[Albert Lavignac]].<ref name=c21>Canarina, p. 21</ref> His fellow violin students included [[George Enescu]], [[Carl Flesch]], [[Fritz Kreisler]] and [[Jacques Thibaud]].<ref name=c21/> Among the piano students at the Conservatoire was [[Alfred Cortot]], with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. At the age of twelve, Monteux organised and conducted a small orchestra of Conservatoire students to accompany Cortot in performances of concertos in and around Paris.<ref name=grove/> He attended the world premiere of [[C<U+00E9>sar Franck]]'s [[Symphony in D minor (Franck)|Symphony]] in February 1889.<ref name=CRC34Canarina>Canarina, John. "Peerless Pierre". ''[[Classic Record Collector]]'', Autumn 2003, Number 34, pp. 9<U+2013>15</ref> From 1889 to 1892, while still a student, he played in the orchestra of the [[Folies Berg<U+00E8>re]];<ref name=c21/> he later said to [[George Gershwin]] that his rhythmic sense was formed during the experience of playing popular dance music there.<ref>Swain, Jonathan. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/September%201994/1/731989/ "Pierre Monteux Edition"], ''Gramophone'', September 1994, p. 131</ref>

At the age of fifteen, while continuing his violin studies, Monteux took up the [[viola]]. He studied privately with [[Benjamin Godard]], with whom he performed in the premiere of [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]]'s Septet, with the composer at the keyboard.<ref name=c21/> Monteux joined the Geloso Quartet as violist; he played many concerts with them, including a performance of [[Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>|Faur<U+00E9>]]'s Second Piano Quartet with the composer at the piano.<ref name=c22>Canarina, p. 22</ref> On another occasion he was the violist in a private performance of a [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] quartet given before the composer in Vienna. Monteux recalled Brahms's remark, "It takes the French to play my music properly. The Germans all play it much too heavily."<ref name=c24>Canarina, p. 24</ref> Monteux remained a member of the Geloso Quartet until 1911.<ref name=grove/> With Johannes Wolff and Joseph Hollman he also played chamber music for [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]].<ref name=CRC34Canarina/> Years later, in his seventies, Monteux deputised with the [[Budapest String Quartet|Budapest Quartet]] without rehearsal or score;<ref name="Reputations <U+2013> Pierre Monteux">Swain, Jonathan.

In 1893, when he was eighteen, Monteux married a fellow student, the pianist Victoria Barri<U+00E8>re. With her he played the complete Beethoven violin sonatas in public. Neither family approved of the marriage; although the Monteux family were not religious, both they and the Roman Catholic Barri<U+00E8>res were doubtful about an [[interfaith marriage|inter-religious marriage]]; furthermore, both families thought the couple too young to marry.<ref name=c22/> There was a son and a daughter from the union.<ref name=c22/>

During his formative years Monteux belonged to a group which toured with the [[Casadesus]] family of musicians and the pianist [[Alfredo Casella]]. The combination played supposed "ancient pieces", allegedly discovered in libraries by one or other of the Casadesus family; [[Marius Casadesus]] later revealed that he or his brother [[Henri Casadesus|Henri]] had written the music.<ref name="MMSmith"/><ref>Scheijen, p. 238</ref> While still a student, in 1893 Monteux was successful in the competition for the chair of first viola of the [[Concerts Colonne]], of which he became assistant conductor and choirmaster the following year.<ref name=grove/> This gave him a link via the orchestra's founder, [[<U+00C9>douard Colonne]], to [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. Colonne had known Berlioz, and through the older conductor Monteux was able to mark his scores with notes based on the composer's intentions.<ref>Canarina, p. 23 & 25</ref> <ref>Monteux (1965), p. 49</ref>{{refn|group=n|These scores were stolen from his Paris apartment by the Nazis in the Second World War and lost.<ref>Monteux (1965), p. 50</ref>}} He was also employed on a freelance basis at the [[Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique]], where he continued to play from time to time for several years; he led the viola section at the 1902 premiere of ''[[Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande (opera)|Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande]]'' under the baton of [[Andr<U+00E9> Messager]].<ref name=times>"Obituary <U+2013> M.

===First conducting posts===
[[File:Saint-Saens-organ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]] at the organ console]]
Monteux's first high profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's [[oratorio]] ''La lyre et la harpe'', to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of "Oui <U+2013> Monteux!". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.<ref>Monteux (1965), p. 45</ref>

Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's ''grandes <U+00E9>coles'', he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as "the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen".<ref>Monteux (1965), p. 63</ref> He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.<ref>Canarina, pp. 20 and 26</ref>

Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] invited him to lead the violas in the [[Bayreuth Festival]] orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris.<ref>"Unquenchable Mr. Monteux", ''The Times'', 4 May 1961, p. 16</ref> In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's ''[[Harold en Italie|Harold in Italy]]'', rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by [[Felix Mottl]].<ref>D'Udine, Jean. [http://archive.org/details/paraphrasesmusic00udin ''Paraphrases musicales sur les grand concerts du dimanche Colonne et Lamoureux 1900<U+2013>1903.''] A Joanin et Cie, Paris, 1904, p. 68</ref> In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the [[Dieppe]] casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation.<ref name="MMSmith"/> By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts.{{refn|group=n|The operas Monteux conducted at Dieppe included ''[[Aida]]'', ''[[La boh<U+00E8>me]]'', ''[[Carmen]]'', ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', ''[[Manon]]'', ''[[Pagliacci]]'', ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'', ''[[Tha<U+00EF>s (opera)|Tha<U+00EF>s]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''.<ref name=c29>Canarina, p. 29</ref>}} As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of [[Arthur Nikisch]], under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.{{refn|group=n|Canarina notes that among Monteux's contemporaries [[Fritz Reiner]] and [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] were also profoundly influenced by Nikisch, and, like Monteux, were known for their unshowy podium personas.<ref name=c29/> Among the other guest conductors of the Concerts Colonne during Monteux's time with the orchestra were [[Gustav Mahler]], Hans Richter, [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Felix Weingartner]].<ref>Caullier, Jo<U+00EB>lle.

===Ballets Russes===
For some time, Monteux's marriage had been under strain, exacerbated by his wife's frequent absences on concert tours. The couple were divorced in 1909; Monteux married one of her former pupils, Germaine Benedictus, the following year.<ref name=c26>Canarina, p. 26</ref>

Monteux continued to play in the Concerts Colonne through the first decade of the century. In 1910 Colonne died and was succeeded as principal conductor by [[Gabriel Piern<U+00E9>]].<ref name=c30>Canarina, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> As well as leading the violas, Monteux was assistant conductor, taking charge of early rehearsals and acting as chorus master for choral works.<ref name=c30/> In 1910 the orchestra was engaged to play for a Paris season given by [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s ballet company, the [[Ballets Russes]]. Monteux played under Piern<U+00E9> in the world premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]''. In 1911 Diaghilev engaged [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]] to conduct the premiere of Stravinsky's ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''. Monteux conducted the preliminary rehearsals before Tcherepnin arrived; Stravinsky was so impressed that he insisted that Monteux conduct the premiere.<ref>Canarina, p. 31</ref>

[[File:Stravinsky-Nijinsky-Petrouchka.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] (l) with [[Vaslav Nijinsky|Nijinsky]] as Petrushka, 1911]]
''Petrushka'' was part of a triple bill, all conducted by Monteux.  The other two pieces were ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'' and ''Scheherazade'', a balletic adaptation of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s symphonic suite of the [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|same name]]. The three works were choreographed by [[Michel Fokine|Fokine]].<ref name=c32>Canarina, p. 32</ref> In later years Monteux disapproved of the appropriation of symphonic music for ballets, but he made an exception for ''Scheherazade'', and, as his biographer John Canarina observes, at that stage in his career his views on the matter carried little weight.<ref name=c32/> ''Petrushka'' was a success with the public and with all but the most diehard conservative critics.<ref>Scheijen, p. 228</ref>

Following the Paris season Diaghilev appointed Monteux principal conductor for a tour of Europe in late 1911 and early 1912. It began with a five-week season at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London.<ref>Scheijen, pp. 236<U+2013>239</ref> The press notices concentrated on the dancers, who included [[Anna Pavlova]] as well as the regular stars of the Ballets Russes,<ref>"Music in London <U+2013> Mme. Pavlova at Covent Garden", ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 31 October 1911, p. 7</ref> but Monteux received some words of praise. ''[[The Times]]'' commented on the excellent unanimity he secured from the players, apart from "occasional uncertainty in the changes of ''tempo''."<ref>"The Russian Ballet", ''The Times'', 17 October 1911, p. 6</ref>

After its season in London the company performed in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin.<ref name=c32/> The tour was successful, artistically and financially, but was not without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down,<ref>Scheijen, pp. 238<U+2013>239</ref> and in Vienna the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra|Philharmonic]] was unequal to the difficulties of the score of ''Petrushka''.<ref>Scheijen, p. 266; and Monteux, p. 85</ref> The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, by the end of which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation.<ref>Nijinska, pp. 455<U+2013>456</ref> In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Piern<U+00E9>; his own deputy, [[D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>-<U+00C9>mile Inghelbrecht]], took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.<ref name=c33>Canarina, p. 33</ref><ref name=c34>Canarina, p. 34</ref>

In May 1912 Diaghilev's company returned to Paris. Monteux was the conductor for the two outstanding works of the season, [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]'s ballet version of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|Pr<U+00E9>lude <U+00E0> l'apr<U+00E8>s-midi d'un faune]]'', made with the composer's approval,<ref>Scheijen, p. 240</ref> and Fokine's ''[[Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>]]'' to a score commissioned from [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]].<ref>Scheijen, p. 244</ref> Monteux later recalled "Debussy was behind me when we played ''L'apr<U+00E8>s midi d'un faune'' because he did not want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when we came to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".<ref>Nichols (1992), p. 186</ref>

In February and March 1913 the Ballets Russes presented another London season. As in 1911, the local orchestra engaged was the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's founder, [[Thomas Beecham]], shared the conducting with Monteux. At the end of February Beecham had to take over ''Petrushka'' when Monteux suddenly hastened to Paris for four days to be with his wife on the birth of their daughter, Denise.{{refn|group=n|Beecham learnt the score at two days' notice, but he managed a successful performance with the help of his players, prompting Nijinsky's only known joke: "How well the orchestra is conducting Mr Beecham tonight".<ref>Reid (1961), p. 140</ref>}}

===''The Rite of Spring''===
During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was ''[[Jeux]]'', with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it "asinine",<ref name=m91/> while Debussy felt that "Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds".<ref>Scheijen, p. 269</ref> The second new work was Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' given under the French title, ''Le sacre du printemps''. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano:
{{quote | I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, "This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it." And, of course, I did.<ref name=m91/>|}}
Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought.<ref>Mousnier, p. 23; and Canarina, pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref> Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es]] to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number.<ref name=m91>Monteux (1965), p. 91</ref> Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, "I did not like ''Le Sacre'' then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now."<ref name=reid>Reid (1961), p. 145</ref> However, he told his wife in 1963 that the ''Rite'' was "now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of ''Le Sacre'' this spring".<ref>Monteux (1965), p. 93</ref>
[[File:RiteofSpringDancers.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancers in [[Nikolai Roerich]]'s costumes for ''The Rite of Spring'': "knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down"]]
The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, other musicians and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the following evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal abuse of the work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out.<ref name=c43>Canarina, p. 43</ref> Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him.<ref name=c43/> Stravinsky wrote "The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than the picture of the stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end."<ref>Buckle, p. 254</ref> The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux "at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor".<ref>Canarina, p. 44</ref> The company presented the ''Rite'' during its London season a few weeks later. ''The Times'' reported that although there was "something like a hostile reception" at the first London performance, the final performance in the season "was received with scarcely a sign of opposition".<ref>"The Fusion of Music and Dancing", ''The Times'', 26 July 1913, p. 8</ref> Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to ''The Rite of Spring''.<ref>Buckle, p. 258</ref>

Monteux believed that most of the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as "knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down".<ref>Noble, Jeremy. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/April%201961/45/795565/ "Stravinsky <U+2013> Le Sacre du Printemps"], ''The Gramophone'', April 1961, p. 45</ref> With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike. At the end Stravinsky was carried shoulder-high from the theatre after what he described as "the most beautiful performance that I have had of the ''Sacre du printemps''".<ref name=Canarina47>Canarina, p. 47</ref> That performance was part of a series of "Concerts Monteux", presented between February and April 1914, in which Monteux conducted the orchestra of the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es in a wide range of symphonic and [[concertante]] works, including the concert premiere of the orchestral version of Ravel's [[Valses nobles et sentimentales (Ravel)|''Valses Nobles et Sentimentales'']].<ref>Ravel, p. 576</ref> His last notable engagement before the outbreak of war was as conductor of the premiere of Stravinsky's opera ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' at the [[Palais Garnier]].<ref name=Canarina47/>

===The Met and Boston===
[[File:Farrar-Homer-Martinelli-Caruso.jpg|thumb|left|Singing under Monteux at the Met: clockwise from top l. [[Geraldine Farrar]], [[Louise Homer]], [[Giovanni Martinelli]] and [[Enrico Caruso]]]]
After the outbreak of the First World War Monteux was again conscripted into the army, serving as a private in the 35th Territorial Regiment,<ref>Stravinsky, p. 61</ref> with which he saw action in the trenches at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], Soissons and the Argonne. He later described much of this period as one of "filth and boredom", although he formed a scratch band to divert his fellow soldiers.<ref name="Canarina48">Canarina, p. 48</ref> After just over two years on active service he was released from military duties after Diaghilev prevailed on the French government to second Monteux to conduct the Ballets Russes on a North American tour.{{refn|group=n|Canarina speculates that Diaghilev's efforts may have been aided by the fact that Monteux's old friend Cortot was Minister of Culture in the government.<ref name="Canarina48"/>}} The tour took in fifty-four cities in the US and Canada. In New York in 1916 Monteux refused to conduct Nijinsky's new ballet ''Till Eulenspiegel'' as the music was by a German <U+2013> [[Richard Strauss]] <U+2013> so a conductor had to be engaged for those performances.<ref>Buckle, p. 316</ref> At the end of the tour Monteux was offered a three-year contract to conduct the French repertoire at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York, and received the permission of the French government to remain in the US.<ref>Canarina, p. 51</ref>

At the Met (as the Metropolitan Opera is generally called), Monteux conducted familiar French works such as ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', ''[[Carmen]]'' and ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'', with singers including [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Geraldine Farrar]], [[Louise Homer]] and [[Giovanni Martinelli]].<ref>Canarina, p. 54</ref> Of his first appearance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Mr. Monteux conducted with skill and authority. He made it evident that he had ample knowledge of the score and control of the orchestra&nbsp;<U+2013> an unmistakably rhythmic beat, a sense of dramatic values."<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=940DE3DA113AE433A2575BC1A9679D946696D6CF "'Faust' Revival is Welcomed at Opera"], ''The New York Times'', 18 November 1917</ref>

===Amsterdam and Paris===
[[File:W. Mengelberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willem Mengelberg]], Monteux's colleague at the [[Concertgebouw]]]]
In 1924, Monteux began a ten-year association with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] of Amsterdam, serving as "first conductor" ("''eerste dirigent''") alongside [[Willem Mengelberg]], its long-serving chief conductor. The two musicians liked and respected one another, despite the difference in their approach to music-making: Monteux was scrupulous in his adherence to a composer's score and straightforward in his performances, while Mengelberg was well known for his virtuoso, sometimes wilful, interpretations and his cavalier attitude to the score ("Ve vill make some changements", as an English player quoted him).<ref>Shore, p. 119</ref> Their preferred repertoire overlapped in some of the classics, but Mengelberg had his own favourites from [[J.S. Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[St. Matthew Passion]]'' to [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] symphonies, and was happy to leave Debussy and Stravinsky to Monteux. Where their choices coincided, as in Beethoven, Brahms and Richard Strauss, Mengelberg was generous in giving Monteux at least his fair share of them.<ref>Canarina, p. 85</ref>

While in Amsterdam Monteux conducted a number of operas, including ''Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande'' (its Dutch premiere), ''Carmen'', ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]'', a [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and Ravel double bill of ''[[Acis et Galat<U+00E9>e]]'' and ''[[L'heure espagnole]]'', [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphig<U+00E9>nie en Tauride]]'' (also brought to the Paris Op<U+00E9>ra<ref>Pitou, Spire. ''The Paris Op<U+00E9>ra. An Encyclopedia of Operas, Ballets, Composers, and Performers <U+2013> Rococo and Romantic, 1715-1815.'' Greenwood Press, 1985, p289.</ref>) and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Toscanini had been invited to conduct the last of these, but he told the promoters that Monteux was his dearest colleague and the best conductor for ''Falstaff''.<ref>Canarina, pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref>

During the first eight years of his association with the Concertgebouw, Monteux conducted between fifty and sixty concerts each season. In his final two years with the orchestra other conductors, notably the rising young Dutchman [[Eduard van Beinum]], were allocated concerts that would previously have been given to Monteux, who amicably withdrew from his position in Amsterdam in 1934.<ref>Canarina, pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref> He returned many times as a guest conductor.<ref name="Reputations <U+2013> Pierre Monteux"/>

[[File:Salle-Pleyel-P1000321.jpg|thumb|right|[[Salle Pleyel]], base of the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Paris]]]]
In addition to his work with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, from 1929 Monteux conducted the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Paris]] (OSP), founded the previous year.{{refn|group=n|The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' incorrectly states that Monteux founded the OSP in 1929.<ref name=grove/>}} The orchestral scene in Paris in the 1920s had been adversely affected by the "deputy" system,<ref>[[Adrian Boult|Boult, Adrian C.]] [http://www.jstor.org/stable/765663 "The Orchestral Problem of the Future"], ''Proceedings of the Musical Association'', 49th Session, (1922<U+2013>1923), pp. 39<U+2013>57 {{subscription}}</ref> whereby any contracted orchestral player was at liberty, if a better engagement became available, to send a deputy to a rehearsal or even to a concert. In most other major cities in Europe and America this practice either had never existed or had been eradicated.<ref name=c105>Canarina, p. 105</ref>  Alongside the opera orchestras, four other Paris orchestras were competing for players.<ref name=mousnier77>Mousnier, p. 77</ref> In 1928 the arts patron [[Winnaretta Singer|Princesse de Polignac]] combined with the fashion designer [[Coco Chanel]] to propose a new orchestra, well enough paid to keep its players from taking conflicting engagements.<ref name=c105/> With financial backing assured, they appointed a triumvirate of musicians <U+2013> Cortot, [[Ernest Ansermet]] and [[Louis Fourestier]] <U+2013> to assemble the OSP.<ref name=n53>Nichols (2002), p. 53</ref> The following year Cortot invited Monteux to become the orchestra's artistic director and principal conductor.<ref name=c106>Canarina, p. 106</ref> Ansermet, its initial musical director, was not pleased at being supplanted by a conductor of whom he was reportedly "ragingly jealous",<ref>Culshaw, p. 181</ref> but the composer [[Darius Milhaud]] commented on how much better the orchestra played for Monteux "since Ansermet has been sent back to his Swiss pastures".<ref name=n53/>

Monteux considered the OSP one of the finest with which he worked.<ref>Monteux (1965), p. 158</ref> He conducted it until 1938, premiering many pieces, including [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Prokofiev)|Third Symphony]] in 1929.<ref name=grove/> The orchestra's generous funding in the first years allowed for ample rehearsals and adventurous programming, presenting contemporary music and the lesser-known works of earlier composers as well as the classic repertoire.<ref name=c105/> In his first season Monteux conducted an all-Stravinsky concert, consisting of the suite from ''The Firebird'' and complete performances of ''Petrushka'' and ''The Rite of Spring''.<ref>Mousnier, p. 76</ref>  The orchestra made European tours in 1930 and 1931, receiving enthusiastic receptions in the Netherlands and Germany. In Berlin the audience could not contain its applause until the end of the ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', and in Monteux's words "went wild" after the slow movement, the "Sc<U+00E8>ne aux champs".<ref>Monteux (1965), p. 160</ref> He approved of spontaneous applause, unlike [[Artur Schnabel]], Sir Henry Wood and [[Leopold Stokowski]], who did all they could to stamp out the practice of clapping between movements.<ref>Canarina, p. 270 (Monteux); Reid (1968), p. 181 (Schnabel); Jacobs, p. 82 (Wood); and Judkins, Jennifer.

After 1931 the OSP suffered the effects of the [[Great Depression]]; much of its funding ceased, and the orchestra reformed itself into a co-operative, pooling such meagre profits as it made.<ref>Canarina, pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref> To give the players some extra work Monteux started a series of conducting classes in 1932. From 1936 he held the classes at his summer home in [[Les Baux-de-Provence|Les Baux]] in Provence, the forerunner of the school he later set up in the US.<ref>Canarina, p. 114</ref>

===San Francisco and the Monteux School===
Monteux first conducted the [[San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]] (SFSO) in 1931, and in 1935 at the age of 60 he was offered the chief conductorship. He was doubtful about accepting, both on personal and on professional grounds. He did not want to leave the OSP, his wife did not want to live on the west coast of America, and the orchestra was so low in funds that it had been forced to cancel an entire season in 1934.<ref>Canarina, pp. 121<U+2013>122</ref> Like most orchestras the SFSO had been badly hit financially by the depression, and it suffered the further difficulty that many of its former players had left for better-paid jobs in Hollywood studios. That problem was exacerbated by the insistence of the [[American Federation of Musicians|Musicians' Union]] that only local players could be recruited.<ref>Canarina, pp. 120 and 122<U+2013>123</ref> Monteux nevertheless accepted the appointment. The SFSO concert season was never longer than five months a year, which enabled him to continue working with the OSP,<ref>Canarina, p. 124</ref> and allowed him to conduct the inaugural concert of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] on 13 November 1937.<ref name=c132>Canarina, p. 132</ref> In ''The New York Times'' Olin Downes wrote that the new orchestra was "of very high rank" and that the broadcast concert had displayed Monteux "at the height of his powers."<ref>Downes, Olin.

''The Times'' said of Monteux's time in San Francisco that it had "incalculable effect on American musical culture", and gave him "the opportunity to expand his already substantial repertory, and by gradual, natural processes to deepen his understanding of his art."<ref name=times/> Monteux consistently programmed new or recent music. He generally avoided, as he did throughout his career, [[atonality|atonal]] or [[serialism|serial]] works,<ref>Canarina p. 264</ref> but his choice of modern works nevertheless drew occasional complaints from conservative-minded members of the San Francisco audience.<ref>Canarina, pp. 146<U+2013>147</ref> Among guest conductors with the SFSO during Monteux's years were [[John Barbirolli]], Beecham, [[Otto Klemperer]], Stokowski and Stravinsky.{{refn|group=n|Monteux regularly invited Stravinsky to conduct the SFSO, giving him generous fees and ample rehearsal time.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 49</ref>}} Soloists included the pianists George Gershwin, Rachmaninoff, [[Arthur Rubinstein]] and Schnabel, the violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and the young [[Isaac Stern]], and singers such as [[Kirsten Flagstad]] and [[Alexander Kipnis]].<ref>Canarina, pp. 127 (Klemperer), 129 (Gershwin), 130 (Stern), 135 (Heifetz and Rubinstein), 136 (Schnabel), 137 (Stokowski), 141 (Barbirolli, Beecham, Flagstad and Rachmaninoff), 143 (Stravinsky), 144 (Kipnis) and 154 (Menuhin)</ref>

Monteux wished to continue his work in helping young conductors: "Conducting is not enough. I must create something. I am not a composer, so I will create fine young musicians."<ref name=history>[http://www.monteuxschool.org/history "A Distinguished History"], Pierre Monteux School, accessed 23 March 2012</ref> In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to [[Igor Markevitch]];<ref>Drew, David and No<U+00EB>l Goodwin.

Previn said that he never forgot this advice.<ref name=p11>Previn, p. 11</ref> Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the [[Pierre Monteux School]] for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer at his home in [[Hancock, Maine]] from 1943 onwards.

===Freelance in the 1950s===
Monteux appeared as guest conductor with many orchestras; he commented in 1955 "I regret they don't have symphony orchestras all over the world so I could see Burma and Samarkand".<ref>Quoted from ''Time'' 28 November 1955 in 'Pierre Monteux in his own words', ''Classic Record Collector'', Autumn 2003, Number 34, p. 18</ref> His successor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, invited many guest conductors during his twenty-five years in charge; Monteux was never among them, probably, in Canarina's view, because of Koussevitzky's jealousy.<ref>Canarina, p. 211</ref> In 1949 Koussevitzky was succeeded by [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], whose early career had been boosted by an invitation from Monteux to conduct the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris in 1933.<ref>Holoman, p. 35</ref> Munch invited Monteux to Boston as a guest conductor in the 1951 season. The engagement was greeted with enthusiasm by the critics and the public, and Munch invited Monteux to join him the following year in heading the orchestra's first European tour. The high point of the tour was a performance under Monteux of ''The Rite of Spring'' at the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Champs-Elys<U+00E9>es, in the presence of the composer.<ref>Canarina, p. 213</ref> Monteux returned annually to Boston every year until his death.<ref name=CRC34Canarina/>
[[File:Metropolitan opera 1905.jpg|left|thumb|The old Metropolitan Opera theatre on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] to which Monteux returned in 1953 after 36 years]]
For some time Monteux had felt that he should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he believed that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished to be free to accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO at the end of the 1952 season.<ref>Canarina, p. 208</ref> He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.<ref>Canarina, p. 215</ref>

After an absence of thirty-four years, Monteux was invited to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1953. The opera chosen was ''Faust'', which he had conducted at his debut at the house in 1917.<ref name=k536>Kolodin, p. 536</ref> The production had what Canarina calls "a stellar cast" headed by [[Jussi Bj<U+00F6>rling]], [[Victoria de los <U+00C1>ngeles]], [[Nicola Rossi-Lemeni]] and [[Robert Merrill]], but the critics, including [[Virgil Thomson]] and [[Irving Kolodin]], reserved their highest praise for Monteux's conducting.<ref>Canarina, pp. 244<U+2013>245</ref> Between 1953 and 1956 Monteux returned to the Met for ''Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande'', ''Carmen'', ''[[Manon]]'', ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' and ''Samson et Dalila''.<ref>Kolodin, pp. 540 (''Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande'' and ''Carmen''), 555 (''Manon''), 556 (''Orfeo ed Euridice''), 560 (''The Tales of Hoffmann)'' and 572 (''Samson et Dalila)''</ref> The Met at that time typecast conductors according to their nationality,{{refn|group=n|Kolodin notes that this policy did not extend to singers: no French singers were cast in Monteux's ''Faust'', despite which "Monteux made the orchestra speak French in a way that evoked much of the special sound in the score".<ref name=k536/>}} and, as a Frenchman, Monteux was not offered any Italian operas. When his request to be engaged for ''La traviata'' in the 1956<U+2013>57 season was refused he severed his ties with the house.<ref>Canarina, p. 247</ref>{{-}}

===London===
Since his first visit to London with the Ballets Russes in 1911, Monteux had had a "love affair with London and with British musicians".<ref name=c33/> He had conducted for the fledgling [[BBC]] in an orchestral concert at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1924,<ref>"B.B.C. Orchestral Concert", ''The Times'', 11 December 1924, p. 12</ref> where he conducted the first public performance of the BBC Wireless Orchestra<ref name="CRCTolansky">Tolansky, John. "Monteux in London", ''Classic Record Collector'', Autumn 2003, Number 34, pp. 16, 17 and 19</ref>, and for the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] at the [[Queen's Hall]] in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>"Royal Philharmonic Society <U+2013> Arthur Bliss's New Work", ''The Times'', 28 January 1927, p. 12; and "French Music", ''The Times'', 16 March 1934, p. 12</ref> In 1932 he was one of four conductors who took charge of the [[The Hall<U+00E9>|Hall<U+00E9> Orchestra]] in Manchester in the absence of its principal conductor; the other three substitutes were [[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]], Beecham and the young Barbirolli.<ref>"The 75th Season of the Hall<U+00E9> Concerts", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 15 October 1932, p. 1</ref> The Hall<U+00E9> players were immensely impressed with Monteux, and said that his orchestral technique and knowledge easily beat those of most other conductors.<ref name=cardus/> In 1951 he conducted the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in a concert of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], Beethoven and [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k|Bart<U+00F3>k]] in the new [[Royal Festival Hall]],<ref>"Royal Festival Hall", ''The Times'', 7 February 1951, p. 10</ref> and made further appearances with London orchestras during the rest of the 1950s. He would have made more but for Britain's strict quarantine laws, which prevented the Monteuxs from bringing their pet French poodle with them; Doris Monteux would not travel without the poodle, and Monteux would not travel without his wife.<ref>Canarina, p. 282</ref>

In June 1958 Monteux conducted the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in three concerts, described by the orchestra's historian Richard Morrison as "a sensation with players, press and public alike."<ref name=rm135>Morrison, p. 135</ref> The first concert included Elgar's ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', in which Cardus judged Monteux to be more faithful to Elgar's conception than English conductors generally were. Cardus added, "After the performance of the 'Enigma' Variations, the large audience cheered and clapped Monteux for several minutes. This applause, moreover, broke out just before the interval. English audiences are not as a rule inclined to waste time applauding at or during an interval: they usually have other things to do."<ref>Cardus, Neville. "'Enigma' Variations Played as Conceived by Elgar Himself: Pierre Monteux conducts the L.S.O.", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 16 June 1958, p. 5</ref> Monteux considered British concertgoers "the most attentive in the world", and British music critics "the most intelligent".<ref name=mapplebeck/> However, a disadvantage of conducting a London orchestra was having to perform at the Festival Hall, of which he shared with Beecham and other conductors an intense dislike: "from the conductor's rostrum it is impossible to hear the violins".<ref name=mapplebeck>Mapplebeck, John. "The Gentle Conductor", ''The Guardian'', 17 November 1960, p. 9</ref>

Monteux's later London performances were not only with the LSO. In 1960 he conducted Beecham's [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] performing "feats of wizardry" in works by Beethoven, Debussy and [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]].<ref>Tracey, Edmund. "Seven Lively Sins", ''[[The Observer]]'' 17 April 1960, p. 22</ref> The LSO offered him the post of principal conductor in 1961, when he was eighty-six; he accepted, on condition that he had a contract for twenty-five years, with an option of renewal.<ref>Morrison, p. 136</ref> His large and varied repertoire was displayed in his LSO concerts. In addition to the French repertoire with which, to his occasional irritation, he was generally associated, he programmed Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Wagner, as well as later composers including [[Enrique Granados|Granados]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], Richard Strauss and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]].<ref>"Success After Squalls", ''The Times'', 11 December 1961, p. 5 (Mozart, Schoenberg and Strauss); "London Orchestra's Concert Series", ''The Times'', 14 September 1961, p. 16 (Beethoven); "Divergent Views of Brahms", The Times, 8 May 1963, p. 5 (Brahms); "Monteux and the L.S.O.", ''The Times'', 11 December 1961, p. 5 (Wagner); " Miss de los Angeles Charms Audience with Berlioz", ''The Times'', 8 December 1962, p. 4 (Granados); "How Russian Composers Find our Music", ''The Times'', 22 May 1961, p. 11 (Scriabin); "Russian Music by the L.S.O.", ''The Times'', 19 May 1962, p. 8 (Shostakovich); "High Quality in Beethoven", ''The Times'', 26 November 1962, p. 14 (Sibelius); "L.S.O.

He gave them extended horizons and some of his achievements with the orchestra, both at home and abroad, gave them quite a different constitution."<ref name="CRCTolansky"/>

===Last years===
Although Monteux retained his vitality to the end of his life, in his last years he suffered occasional collapses. In 1962 he fainted during a performance of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]].<ref>"M. Monteux Continues after Collapse on Rostrum", ''The Times'', 14 December 1962, p. 15</ref> In 1963 he collapsed again after being presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Britain's highest musical honour. The presentation was made by [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]], who recalled that as they left the platform, "Monteux gave two little groans as we walked down the passage, and I suddenly found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting."<ref>Boult (1973), p. 169</ref> Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.<ref>"Monteux Pupil Unperturbed", ''The Times'', 22 April 1964, p. 10; and "Mr. Maazel instead of M. Monteux", ''The Times'', 27 April 1964, p. 6</ref>

In April 1964 Monteux conducted his last concert, which was in [[Milan]] with the orchestra of [[RAI|Radiotelevisione italiana]]. The programme consisted of the overture to ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', Brahms's [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] and Berlioz's ''Symphonie fantastique''.<ref>Canarina, p. 311</ref> Unrealised plans included his debut at [[The Proms]],<ref>"Proms to Get a Larger Audience", ''The Times'', 11 June 1964, p. 17</ref> and his 90th birthday concert, at which he intended to announce his retirement.<ref name=tribute>"Musical Tribute to Monteux", ''The Times'', 5 April 1965, p. 6</ref>{{refn|group=n|The two scheduled Prom concerts were conducted as a tribute to Monteux by [[Rudolf Kempe]].<ref>"Rudolf Kempe at the Proms", ''The Times'', 15 September 1964, p. 14</ref> The planned 90th birthday concert became a memorial concert conducted by Monteux's successor as chief conductor of the LSO, [[Istv<U+00E1>n Kert<U+00E9>sz (conductor)|Istv<U+00E1>n Kert<U+00E9>sz]]. It comprised Bach's [[Brandenburg concertos#Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048|Third Brandenburg Concerto]], Brahms's [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto]] with Isaac Stern, and Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]].<ref name=tribute/>}} In June 1964 Monteux suffered three strokes and a cerebral thrombosis at his home in Maine, where he died on 1 July at the age of 89.<ref>Canarina, p. 313</ref>

==Personal life==
Monteux had six children, two of them adopted. From his first marriage there were a son, Jean Paul, and a daughter, Suzanne. Jean Paul became a jazz musician, performing with artists such as [[Josephine Baker]] and [[Mistinguett]].<ref name=c22/> His second marriage produced a daughter, Denise, later known as a sculptress, and a son, [[Claude Monteux|Claude]], a [[flautist]].<ref>Canarina, pp. 239<U+2013>240</ref> After Monteux married Doris Hodgkins he legally adopted her two children, Donald, later a restaurateur, and Nancie, who after a career as a dancer became administrator of the Pierre Monteux School in Hancock.<ref name=history/> Monteux's brother, Henri, a successful actor, died in [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] concentration camp in 1944.<ref>Canarina, p. 148</ref>

Among Monteux's numerous honours, he was a Commandeur of the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]] and a Knight of the [[Order of Oranje-Nassau]].<ref name=grove/> In 1960 he was inducted into in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.walkoffame.com/pierre-monteux Pierre Monteux. Inducted to the Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960 with 1 star], Hollywood Chamber of Commerce (2012). Retrieved 3 October 2012</ref>  A political and social moderate, in the politics of his adopted homeland he supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]<ref name=mapplebeck/> and was a strong opponent of racial discrimination. He ignored taboos on employing black artists;<ref>Canarina, p. 71</ref> reportedly, during the days of segregation in the US, when told he could not be served in a restaurant "for colored folk" he insisted that he was coloured <U+2013> pink.<ref>Monteux (1962), pp. 13<U+2013>15</ref>

==Music making==
===Reputation and repertoire===
The record producer [[John Culshaw]] described Monteux as "that rarest of beings&nbsp;<U+2013> a conductor who was loved by his orchestras ... to call him a legend would be to understate the case."<ref>Culshaw, p. 144</ref> Toscanini observed that Monteux had the best baton technique he had ever seen.<ref name="rm135"/> Like Toscanini, Monteux insisted on the traditional orchestral layout with first and second violins to the conductor's left and right, believing that this gave a better representation of string detail than grouping all the violins together on the left.{{refn|group=n|Monteux's view on the layout of first and second violins was shared by, among others, Klemperer and Boult; the latter wrote, "I am in a small minority. However, on my side are (Bruno) [[Bruno Walter|Walter]], Monteux, Klemperer and a few others, including Toscanini..."<ref>Boult (1983), p. 146)</ref>}} On fidelity to composers' scores, Monteux's biographer John Canarina ranks him with Klemperer and above even Toscanini, whose reputation for strict adherence to the score was, in Canarina's view, less justified than Monteux's.<ref>Canarina, p. 83</ref>
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F8E0F7|salign=right| quote = Our principal work is to keep the orchestra together and carry out the composer's instructions, not to be sartorial models, cause dowagers to swoon, or distract audiences by our "interpretation".| source = Pierre Monteux <ref name=cosman>Smith (1957), p. 98</ref>|align=left|width=250px}}

According to the biographical sketch in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Monteux "was never an ostentatious conductor ... [he prepared] his orchestra in often arduous rehearsals and then [used] small but decisive gestures to obtain playing of fine texture, careful detail and powerful rhythmic energy, retaining to the last his extraordinary grasp of musical structure and a faultless ear for sound quality."<ref name=grove/> Monteux was extremely economical with words and gestures and expected a response from his smallest movement.<ref name="CRCTolansky"/> Record producer Erik Smith recalled of Monteux's rehearsals with the Vienna Philharmonic for Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]] and Brahms's [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second]], "although he could not speak to the orchestra in German, he transformed their playing from one take to the next".<ref name="MMSmith"/>

The importance of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev asked him to conduct Stravinsky's new [[Les Noces]] with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but I have to do what ze composer 'as written."<ref name="MMSmith"/> Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of ''[[The Nation]]'', [[B. H. Haggin]], while admitting that Monteux was generally regarded as one of the giants of conducting, wrote of his "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity".<ref>Haggin, p. 127</ref>  Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 [[Carleton Smith]] wrote, "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'&nbsp;<U+2013> the Boston, [[Philadelphia Orchestra|Philadelphia]] and [[New York Philharmonic]] orchestras."<ref name=cosman/> In his 1967 book ''The Great Conductors'', [[Harold C. Schonberg]] wrote of Monteux, "[A] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly."<ref>Schonberg (1967), p. 328</ref> Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's "passion and charisma".<ref>Schonberg (1981), p. 59</ref> When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, "Damned professional".<ref>Monteux (1962), p. 63</ref>

Throughout his career Monteux suffered from being thought of as a specialist in French music. The music that meant most to him was that of German composers, particularly Brahms, but this was often overlooked by concert promoters and recording companies. Of the four Brahms symphonies, he was invited by the recording companies to record only one, the Second. Recordings of his live performances of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Third]] have been released on CD, but the discography in Canarina's biography lists no recording, live or from the studio, of the [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth]].<ref name=disco>Canarina, pp. 321<U+2013>340</ref> The critic [[William Mann (critic)|William Mann]], along with many others, regarded him as a "supremely authoritative" conductor of Brahms,<ref>"Style and the Bounds of Nationalism", ''The Times'', 21 April 1961, p. 20</ref> though Cardus disagreed: "In German music Monteux, naturally enough, missed harmonic weight and the right heavily lunged tempo. His rhythm, for example, was a little too pointed for, say, Brahms or Schumann."<ref name=cardus/> ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]''{{'}}s reviewer Jonathan Swain contends that no conductor knew more than Monteux about expressive possibilities in the strings, claiming that "the conductor who doesn't play a stringed instrument simply doesn't know how to get the different sounds; and the bow has such importance in string playing that there are maybe 50 different ways of producing the same note".<ref name="gramophone.net"/>

In his 2003 biography, John Canarina lists nineteen "significant world premieres" conducted by Monteux. In addition to ''Petrushka'' and ''The Rite of Spring'' is a further Stravinsky work, ''The Nightingale''. Monteux's other premieres for Diaghilev included Ravel's ''Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>'' and Debussy's ''Jeux''. In the concert hall he premiered works by, among others, Milhaud, [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] and Prokofiev.{{refn|group=n|The works listed by Canarina are: Stravinsky, ''Petrushka'', Ballets Russes, Paris, 13 June 1911; Ravel, ''Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>'', Ballets Russes, Paris, 8 June 1912; Debussy, ''Jeux'', Ballets Russes, Paris, 15 May 1913 ; Stravinsky, ''The Rite of Spring'', Ballets Russes, Paris, 29 May 1913; [[Florent Schmitt]], ''La Trag<U+00E9>die de Salom<U+00E9>'', Paris, 12 June 1913; Stravinsky, ''The Nightingale'', Paris, 26 May 1914; [[Charles Griffes]], ''The Pleasure-Dome of Kubla Khan'', Boston, 28 November 1919; Ravel, ''[[Tzigane]]'', ([[Samuel Dushkin]], soloist), Amsterdam, 19 October 1924; [[Willem Pijper]], Symphony No 3, Amsterdam, 28 October 1926; [[Arthur Bliss|Bliss]], ''Hymn to Apollo'', Amsterdam, 28 November 1926; Poulenc, ''[[Concert champ<U+00EA>tre]]'', ([[Wanda Landowska]], soloist), Paris, 3 May 1929; Prokofiev [[Symphony No. 3 (Prokofiev)|Symphony No 3]], Paris, 17 May 1929; Milhaud, Viola Concerto ([[Paul Hindemith]], soloist) Amsterdam, 15 December 1929; [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]], Violin Concerto, (Viola Mitchell, soloist), Amsterdam, 5 March 1933; [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]], ''Evocations'', San Francisco, 11 February 1938; [[Roger Sessions]], Symphony No 2, San Francisco, 9 January 1947; [[George Antheil]], Symphony No 6, San Francisco, 10 February 1949.<ref>Canarina, p. 341</ref>}} In a letter of April 1914 Stravinsky wrote "everyone can appreciate your zeal and your probity in regard to the contemporary works of various tendencies that you have had occasion to defend."<ref>Stravinsky, p. 60</ref>

Monteux's biographer Jean-Philippe Mousnier analysed a representative sample of Monteux's programmes for more than 300 concerts. The symphonies played most frequently were C<U+00E9>sar Franck's D minor Symphony, the ''Symphonie fantastique'', Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh]], Tchaikovsky's [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Fifth]] and [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Sixth]], and the first two symphonies of Brahms. Works by Richard Strauss featured almost as often as those of Debussy, and Wagner's Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' as often as ''The Rite of Spring''.<ref>Mousnier, pp. 235<U+2013>248</ref>

Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a [[viola|violist]] in "Plus blanche que la blanche hermine" from ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] in 1903 for [[Path<U+00E9> Records|Path<U+00E9>]] with the tenor Albert Vaguet.<ref>{{cite book|last= Giroud |first= Vincent |year= 2009|title=''Liner notes to'' Meyerbeer on Record 1899<U+2013>1913 |location=Swarthmore, PA |publisher=Marston Records |oclc= 459789444}}</ref> It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906<U+2013>07.<ref>Daouste, Raoul.

Stravinsky, who also recorded ''The Rite'' in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.<ref>Walsh, Stephen.

Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964.<ref>Discographical information in booklet for: Pierre Monteux&nbsp;<U+2013> Decca and Philips Recordings 1956<U+2013>1964 (475 7798).

In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, "if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions".<ref name=times102/> Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc.<ref>Achenbach, Andrew. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/May%202006/83/857556/ "Orchestral Reissues"], ''Gramophone'', May 2006, p. 83</ref> It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings "a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line."<ref>Frank, Mortimer H. "Review of CDs 'Sunday Evenings with Pierre Monteux'". ''[[Classic Record Collector]]'', Summer 1998, Number 13, pp. 102<U+2013>105</ref>
