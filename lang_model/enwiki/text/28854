'''Dextroamphetamine''' is a powerful [[psychostimulant]] which produces increased wakefulness, energy and self-confidence in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. It is perhaps the archetypal psychostimulant, and drugs with similar psychoactive properties are often referred to as "amphetamine analogues", or described as having "amphetamine-like", or even "amphetaminergic" effects. Its stimulant properties are similar to those of [[methylphenidate]] and [[methamphetamine]], though with a slower onset of action and a duration that lies somewhere between the two.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Dextroamphetamine is the [[enantiomer|dextrorotary]] stereoisomer of the [[amphetamine]] molecule, which can take two different forms. Other common names for dextroamphetamine include '''d-amphetamine''', '''dexamphetamine''', '''(''S'')-(+)-amphetamine''', and brand names such as '''Dexedrine''' and '''Dextrostat'''. It is combined with levo-amphetamine in [[Adderall]] and other racemic amphetamines.

==History==
Amphetamine was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] under the chemical name "phenylisopropylamine" in [[Berlin]], 1887 by the Romanian chemist [[Lazar Edeleanu]]. It was not widely marketed until 1932, when the pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline, and French (currently known as [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) introduced it in the form of the [[Benzedrine]] Inhaler, for combating cold symptoms. Notably, the chemical form of Benzedrine in the inhaler was the liquid-free base, not a chloride or sulfate salt. In free-base form, amphetamine is a volatile oil, hence the efficacy of the inhalers. 

Three years later, in 1935, the medical community became aware of the stimulant properties of amphetamine, specifically dextroamphetamine, and in 1937 Smith, Kline, and French introduced Dexedrine tablets, under the tradename Dexedrine. In the United States, Dexedrine tablets were approved to treat [[narcolepsy]], [[attention deficit disorder|attention disorders]], depression, and obesity. Dextroamphetamine was marketed in various other forms in the following decades, primarily by Smith, Kline, and French, such as several combination medications including a mixture of dextroamphetamine and [[amobarbital]] (a [[barbiturate]]) sold under the tradename [[Dexamyl]] and, in the 1950s, an extended release capsule (the "Spansule").

It quickly became apparent that Dexedrine and other amphetamines had a high potential for [[substance abuse|abuse]], although they were not heavily [[controlled substances|controlled]] until 1970, when the [[Controlled Substance Act|Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act]] was passed by the United States Congress. Dexedrine, along with other sympathomimetics, was eventually classified as schedule II, the most restrictive category possible for a drug with recognized medical uses.

==Chemistry==
Dextroamphetamine is a slightly polar, weak base and is [[lipophilic]].

==Formulations==
====Dextroamphetamine sulfate====
[[Image:Dexamphetamine sulfate 5 mg tablets.jpg|250px|thumb|right|5mg dexamphetamine sulfate tablets]]
A tablet preparation of the [[salt]] dextroamphetamine sulfate (pharmaceutical names: '''Dexedrine''' or '''Dextrostat''') is available in two strengths: 5&nbsp;mg and 10&nbsp;mg. A pharmaceutical with a strength of 30mg dextroamphetamine sulfate is 22.0 mg dextroamphetamine.
[[Image:Dexedrine Spansules.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sustained-Release 15mg Dexedrine Spansules ]]
Dextroamphetamine sulfate is also available in a controlled release version (pharmaceutical name: '''Dexedrine SR''' or '''Dexedrine Spansule'''), capsulated in the strengths: 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg, and 15&nbsp;mg.

====Lisdexamfetamine====
{{main|Lisdexamfetamine}}
Dextroamphetamine is also the [[metabolite]] of the [[prodrug]] [[lisdexamfetamine]] dimesylate (pharmaceutical name: '''Vyvanse'''). Vyvanse is meant to provide once-a-day dosing because it regulates a slow release of dextroamphetamine into the brain. Vyvanse is available as [[capsules]], in three strengths: 30&nbsp;mg, 50&nbsp;mg, and 70&nbsp;mg. A 30mg-strength Vyvanse capsule is molecularly equivalent to 8.88mg dextroamphetamine. However, this molecular equivalence would only hold true as a [[bioequivalence]] ratio if: the dimesylate salt instantly dissolved resulting in the complete dissociation of lisdexamfetamine ions, and then the covalent amide bond of every lisdexamfetamine molecule immediately underwent hydrolysis. In fact, being a prodrug, lisdexamfetamine has different properties than dextroamphetamine; for instance, lisdexamfetamine is metabolised in the gastrointestinal tract, while dextroamphetamine's metabolism is hepatic.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/2007/021977s000_PharmToxR.pdf FDA Approval of Vyvanse Pharmacological Reviews Pages 18 and 19 ]</ref>

====Mixed amphetamine salts====
[[Image:Adderall 30mg small.jpg|left|250px|thumb|right|Instant Release 30mg Adderall Tablets]]
Another pharmaceutical that contains "active ingredients" in addition to dextroamphetamine is [[Adderall]]. The drug formulation of Adderall (both controlled and instant release forms) is:
::One-quarter racemic (d,l-)amphetamine [[aspartate]] [[monohydrate]]
::One-quarter dextroamphetamine [[saccharate]]
::One-quarter dextroamphetamine [[sulfate]]
::One-quarter racemic (d,l-)amphetamine sulfate
Aspartate, saccharate, and sulfate salts differ [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetically]] in the rate at which they are [[drug metabolism|metabolized]] by the body. For this and other reasons, Adderall's effects are different from pharmaceuticals with dextroamphetamine as an exclusive active ingredient. Contrary to the beliefs that Adderall is three-quarters dextroamphetamine, dextroamphetamine accounts for 72.7% of the amphetamine base in Adderall (the remaining percentage is [[amphetamine|levoamphetamine]]). Adderall<U+2019>s inclusion of levoamphetamine provides the pharmaceutical with a quicker onset and longer clinical effect compared to pharmaceuticals exclusively formulated of dextroamphetamine<!--

==Uses==
===Clinical===
*Primarily used to treat [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). In some localities it has replaced [[methylphenidate]] as the first-choice medication for ADHD, a role in which it is considered highly effective.
*Treatment of [[Narcolepsy]], generally where non-pharmacological measures have proved insufficient.
*Occasionally prescribed for weight-loss in cases of extreme obesity.

====Experimental====
Though such use remains out of the mainstream, dextroamphetamine has been successfully applied in the treatment of certain categories of depression as well as other psychiatric syndromes.<!--

===Military===
The U.S. Air Force uses dextroamphetamine as its "go-pill,", given to pilots on long missions to help them remain focused and alert.<ref>http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0801-06.htm</ref><ref>Emonson DL, Vanderbeek RD. (1995) ''The use of amphetamines in U.S. Air Force tactical operations during Desert Shield and Storm.'' 66(8):802</ref> Other branches of the U.S. military (as well as the armed forces of other nations{{Fact|date=June 2007}}) commonly use or have dispensed dextroamphetamine to troops to prevent or treat fatigue in combat situations{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Because of the propensity of dextroamphetamine to cause behavioral side effects, this use is viewed as controversial; (Friendly Fire incidents are linked sometimes to the use of this drug and its effects on long term fatigued pilots; e.g. [[Tarnak Farm incident]]) newer stimulant medications with fewer side effects, like [[modafinil]] are being investigated for this reason. [[NASA]] has also used dextroamphetamine to combat fatigue in astronauts near the end of a mission.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Illicit===
Along with Ritalin, illicit use of dextroamphetamine has been reported among students, both as a study aid, social aid, and for purely recreational purposes. According to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], 4% of American college students reported non-prescription stimulant use in 2004.<ref>[http://www.nida.nih.gov/NIDA_notes/NNvol20N4/Studies.html NIDA Notes Volume 20, Number 4 (March 2006)]</ref>

==Overdose==
[[Image:Dexedrine doj.jpg|frame|right]]
The ''Physician's 1991 Drug Handbook'' reports: "Symptoms of overdose include restlessness, tremor, [[hyperreflexia]], [[tachypnea]], confusion, aggressiveness, [[hallucinations]], and panic." [[Dilated pupils]] are common with high doses.

The fatal dose in humans is not precisely known, but in various species of rat generally ranges between 50 and 100 mg/kg, or a factor of 100 over what is required to produce noticeable psychological effects.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Miczek K | title = A new test for aggression in rats without aversive stimulation: differential effects of d-amphetamine and cocaine. | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl) | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 253-9 | year = 1979 | id = PMID 108702 | doi=10.1007/BF00426664 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v11jj22163t30326/ | format=Abstract}}</ref><!--

This suggests a wide therapeutic range, in contrast to such drugs as [[morphine]] and [[heroin]], where effective doses may be as much as 50% of a fatal dose. Although the symptoms seen in a fatal overdose are similar to those of methamphetamine, their mechanisms are not identical, as some substances which inhibit d-amphetamine toxicity do not do so for methamphetamine.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Derlet R, Albertson T, Rice P | title = Antagonism of cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine toxicity. | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 745-9 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2217500}}</ref><!--

An extreme symptom of overdose is [[amphetamine psychosis]], characterized by vivid visual, auditory, and sometimes tactile hallucinations. Many of its symptoms are identical to the [[psychosis]]-like state which follows long-term sleep deprivation, so it remains unclear whether these are solely the effect of the drug, or due to the long periods of sleep deprivation which are often undergone by the chronic user or abuser. "In apparently sensitive individuals, psychosis may be produced by 55 to 75 mg of dextroamphetamine. With high enough doses, psychosis can probably be induced in anyone."<!--

  -->.<ref name = "de Wit"/>
Clinically significant side effects of dextroamphetamine include sleeplessness, reduced appetite, dryness of mouth, and headaches. The ''Physician's 1991 Drug Handbook'' reports: "Symptoms of overdose include restlessness, tremor, [[hyperreflexia]], [[tachypnea]], confusion, aggressiveness, [[hallucination]]s, and [[panic]]." Note that many of the symptoms of [[Amphetamine psychosis]] are identical to the psychosis-like state which follows long-term sleep deprivation, so it remains unclear pending further studies whether or not these are solely the effect of the drug(s) themselves, or due to the long periods of sleep deprivation which is often undergone by the use of amphetamines

===Effect on neurochemistry===
Dextroamphetamine affects the dynamics [[neurotransmitter]] systems, and its mechanisms of action are continuously being investigated and discovered.

====Monoamines====
Dextroamphetamine affects dopamine and serotonin levels in the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]], and norepinephrine in the [[hippocampus]]. Because dextroamphetamine is a substrate analog at monoamine transports, at all doses, dextroamphetamine prevents the reuptake of these neurotransmitters<!--   
-->,<ref name="Kuczenski">{{cite journal | author = Kuczenski R ''et al''. | title = Hippocampus Norepinephrine, Caudate Dopamine and Serotonin, and Behavioral Responses to the Stereoisomers of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 1308<U+2013>1317 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7869099}} [http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/15/2/1308 Free full text (PDF)]</ref> causing them to remain in the synaptic cleft for a prolonged period (inhibiting monoamine reuptake in rats with ratios of about: NE:DA = 1:1, NE:5HT = 1:10<ref>Rothman, et al. "Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Stimulants Release Norepinephrine more Potently than they Release Dopamine and Serotonin." (2001): ''Synapse'' '''39''', 32<U+2013>41 (Table V. on page 37)</ref>). At some point, when doses are high, and the concentration of dextroamphetamine is high enough<!--   
-->,<ref name="Kuczenski"/> dextroamphetamine will enter nerve cells and cause release of monoamines from the cytoplasmic dopamine pool (as opposed to 'protected' vesicular stores)<!--   
-->.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Patrick, and Markowitz | title = Pharmacology of Methylphenidate, Amphetamine Enantiomers and Pemoline in Attention-Deificit Hyperacitivty Disorder | journal = Human Psychopharmacology | volume = 12 | pages = 527-546 (Page:530) | year = 1997}}</ref> In such high concentrations, dextroamphetamine will cause the [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]] and, [[serotonin]](5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse (releasing monoamines in rats with ratios of about [[Norepinephrine|NE]]:[[Dopamine|DA]] = 1:3.5, NE:[[5HT]]= 1:250), causing increased stimulation of post-synaptic receptors.

====Glutamate====
Dextroamphetamine does not alter glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex. This may be because dextroamphetamine increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex; activation of the dopamine-2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex inhibits glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex. However activation of the dopamine-1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex, increases glutamate leves in the in the nucleus accumbens. An increase of the glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens may be part of the reason that dextroamphetamine has the an ability to increase locomotor activity in rats. Serotonin may also play a role in dextroamphetamines affect on glutamate levels<!--   
-->.<ref name="Shoblock"/>

===Time course and elimination===
On average, about one half of a given dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine, while the other half is broken down into various metabolites (mostly [[benzoic acid]]).<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mofenson H, Greensher J | title = Letter: Physostigmine as an antidote: use with caution. | journal = J Pediatr | volume = 87 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1011-2 | year = 1975 | id = PMID 1185381}}</ref>
However, the drug's half-life is highly variable because the rate of excretion is very sensitive to urinary pH. Under alkaline conditions, direct excretion is negligible and 95%+ of the dose is metabolized. The main metabolic pathway is d-amphetamine <math>\rightarrow \;</math> [[phenylacetone]] <math>\rightarrow \;</math> benzoic acid <math>\rightarrow \;</math> [[hippuric acid]]. Another pathway, mediated by enzyme [[CYP2D6]], is d-amphetamine <math>\rightarrow \;</math> p-hydroxyamphetamine <math>\rightarrow \;</math> p-hydroxynorephedrine. Although p-hydroxyamphetamine is a minor metabolite (~5% of the dose), it may may have significant physiological effects as a [[norepinephrine]] analogue.<!--

Subjective effects are increased by larger doses, however, over the course of a given dose there is a noticeable divergence between such effects and drug concentration in the blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Asghar S, Tanay V, Baker G, Greenshaw A, Silverstone P |title=Relationship of plasma amphetamine levels to physiological, subjective, cognitive and biochemical measures in healthy volunteers |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=291<U+2013>9 |year=2003 |pmid=12766934}}</ref> In particular, mental effects peak before maximal blood levels are reached, and decline as blood levels remain stable or even continue to increase.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Angrist B, Corwin J, Bartlik B, Cooper T | title = Early pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of oral D-amphetamine in normal subjects. | journal = Biol Psychiatry | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = 1357-68 | year = 1987 | id = PMID 3663788}}</ref><!--

This indicates a mechanism for development of acute tolerance, perhaps distinct from that seen in chronic use. Its slower onset of action as compared to methamphetamine and methylphenidate is presumably due to a somewhat lower effectiveness in crossing the [[blood-brain barrier]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie R, Heischober B |title=Methamphetamine |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=305<U+2013>9 |year=1997 |pmid=9286149}}</ref>

===Chronic use===
{{misleading|section}}
While continuous dosing with amphetamine causes tolerance, intermittent use produces "reverse tolerance" or sensitization to its psychological effects.<!--   
--><ref>{{cite journal | author = Leith N, Kuczenski R | title = Chronic amphetamine: tolerance and reverse tolerance reflect different behavioral actions of the drug. | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 399-404 | year = 1981 | id = PMID 7291243}}</ref><!--

--><ref>http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/63/12/1386</ref> 
As a result, regular use commonly results in a quick decrease of unwanted side effects, but without an equivalent loss of its stimulant properties. Notably, the sensitization is induced more quickly, and persists far longer than withdrawal-related effects, suggesting a phenomenon more complex than a simple tolerance-induced withdrawal syndrome.
