==Description of the organization==

About AIB|publisher=America in Bloom|accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref> ([[Britain in Bloom]] and [[Communities in Bloom]]). It has grown to 180 participating cities in 38 states.

America in Bloom is a grass-roots urban renewal program which provides a framework and is a catalyst for community organizations to work together for visible improvements. It offers one-on-one mentoring to participating communities and provides an extensive written evaluation detailing recommended improvements and enhancements. Its website provides educational materials for beautification programs.

Through its national awards and mentoring program, AIB helps towns harness untapped energy, talent, and resources to champion greening, enhance environmental awareness, promote economic development, and improve quality of life.

The AIB program is designed to bring people from every demographic together to create meaningful, visible, constructive projects, by combining efforts of residents, businesses, and local government. These groups work on common goals in eight areas: floral displays, landscaped areas, urban forestry, turf and groundcover areas, environmental awareness, tidiness, heritage preservation, and community involvement.<ref>{{Cite news
