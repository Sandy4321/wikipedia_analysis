Among his more important works must be named ''The Capitulation of Sedan'', ''Proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles'', ''Moltke before Paris'', ''Moltke at Versailles'', ''The Meeting of Bismarck and Napoleon III'', ''Christ and the Tribute Money'', ''William I visiting the Tombs'', ''The Congress of Berlin'', and some decorations executed in [[mosaic]] for the Triumphal Arch at Berlin.
