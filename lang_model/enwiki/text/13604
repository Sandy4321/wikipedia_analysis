It was once among the [[List of best-selling computer and video games#Top 20|top twenty best-selling console games]] of all time, peaking at second best for the PlayStation 2 and was also voted by the readers of the Japanese video game magazine [[Famitsu]] to be the greatest video game of all-time.<ref name="top100">{{cite web | author=Campbell, Colin | year=2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2401&Itemid=2 | accessmonthday=October 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> <!-- Selling more than 7.93 million copies worldwide, it became the second best-selling title of the series.

''Final Fantasy X'' marks the ''Final Fantasy'' series' transition from entirely [[pre-rendered]] backdrops to fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] areas, achieved with the PlayStation 2<U+2019>s [[Emotion Engine]] processor. Though pre-rendered backgrounds are not entirely absent, their use has been restricted to less vibrant locations, such as building interiors.<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | author=IGN site staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Review | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/164/164008p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN] | accessmonthday=August 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy X'' is also the first game in the series to feature a wide range of realistic facial expressions, as well as other technological developments in graphical effects achieved, such as variance in lighting and shadow from one section of a character's clothing to the next.<ref name="interviews">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America site staff | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/na/ Square Enix North America] | accessmonthday=April 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy X'' is also the first in the series to feature [[voice-over]] actors, as well as the first to spawn a direct [[sequel]], ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

''Final Fantasy X'' introduces other significant advances in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. For instance, because of the implementation of voice-overs, scenes in the game are paced according to the time taken for dialogue to be spoken,<ref name="interviews" /> whereas previous games in the series incorporated scrolling subtitles. ''Final Fantasy X'' features changes in world design, with a focus placed on realism. The gameplay makes a significant departure from past games as well, incorporating several new elements.

==Gameplay==
Like previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' is presented in third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, [[Tidus]], or [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] in some cases, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike in previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] "battle area" where characters and enemies must await their turn to attack.

In line with previous titles in the series, players are given the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional [[experience point]] system was replaced by a new system called the "Sphere Grid". The game was initially going to feature [[Internet|online]] elements, but these were dropped during production, and online [[multiplayer game|multiplayer gaming]] would not become part of the ''Final Fantasy'' series until ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''.<ref name="online">{{cite web | author=Johnson, Bill | year=2000 | title=Square Looks Ahead | url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2000/111700b.html | work=[http://rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessmonthday=April 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="online2">{{cite web | author=Avistetto, Jimmy | year=2000 | title=Final Fantasy X Not Online-Capable | url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2000/112000b.html | work=[http://rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessmonthday=April 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Field map===
[[Image:Ffxfieldmapexample.jpg|thumb|left|225px|An example of navigation on the field map]]
''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay differs from that of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in its lack of an interactive [[top-down perspective]] "[[overworld|world map]]" navigation system. Previous games had featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In ''Final Fantasy X'', instead, almost all game locations are essentially contiguous and never fade out to an interactive overworld map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an [[airship (video game)|airship]] becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate the world of Spira in a matter of seconds.

Map director [[Takayoshi Nakazato]] has explained that with ''Final Fantasy X'', he wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional ''Final Fantasy'' game, in-line with the realism afforded by the mechanics of the game's dominant 3D backgrounds, as opposed to that offered by pre-rendered backgrounds (which he refers to as "pseudo 3D environments").<ref name="interviews" />

===Battle system===
[[Image:FFXbattleexample.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A typical battle with a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]]]
''Final Fantasy X'' introduces the [[Square Enix battle systems#Conditional Turn-Based|Conditional Turn-Based Battle]] (CTB) system in place of the series' traditional [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system, which was originally developed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] and was first used in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. The system was developed by battle director [[Toshiro Tsuchida]], who had ''Final Fantasy IV'' in mind when developing the CTB system. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design gives the player an indefinite period of time to select an action. The CTB system also allows characters' and enemies' attributes and actions to affect the number of turns they are allowed and the order in which they occur. The game provides a graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen, detailing who will be receiving turns next, as well as how various actions taken (such as using the magical spell ''Slow'' on the enemy) will affect the subsequent order of turns. 

Character-specific special abilities (known as "[[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Battle systems and Limit Breaks|Limit Break]]s" in some other ''Final Fantasy'' games) reappear in ''Final Fantasy X'' under the name "Overdrives". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring [[fighting game]]-style button inputs or precise timing to increase their effectiveness. Furthermore, an "Overdrive meter" was introduced to determine when such an ability could be executed. Through the use of different "Overdrive Modes", the player is allowed to designate what circumstances (such as receiving damage, slaying an enemy, or being the only living character on the field) cause the Overdrive meter to fill.

''Final Fantasy X'' allows the player to control only up to three characters in battle at once, but a "swapping system" allows the player to replace any of them with one of the (eventually) four others waiting on the sidelines.  A player may swap one character for another at any time, unless the on-field character is dead.  Swapping is encouraged by the fact that each character has a specialized application: [[Yuna]] has the greatest skill at healing with [[Final Fantasy magic#White Magic|White Magic]] and can use [[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|summon]] spells; [[Rikku]] is adept at using and stealing items; Tidus can use time-altering magic and accurately strike agile enemies; [[Wakka]] can inflict negative [[status effect]]s and accurately strike flying enemies; [[Auron]] can pierce enemies' defenses and has the greatest physical strength; [[Kimahri Ronso|Kimahri]] can use [[Final Fantasy magic#Blue Magic|enemy skills]]; and [[Lulu (Final Fantasy X)|Lulu]] has elemental [[Final Fantasy magic#Black Magic|Black Magic]] spells suited for use against elementally aligned enemies.

[[Image:FFXoverdriveexample2.JPG|thumb|left|250px|An activated Overdrive awaiting button-inputs]]''Final Fantasy X'' introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous installments of the series. Whereas in previous games a summoned creature would arrive, perform a single action, and then depart, ''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> summons (called "[[List of Final Fantasy X characters#Aeons|aeons]]") arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the enemy has been slain, the aeon itself has been defeated, or the aeon is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own stats, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives, and in addition to providing powerful attacks, they can be employed as "[[meat shield]]s" while fighting difficult bosses, as the enemy must first kill any summoned aeon before it can damage the party directly. The player acquires a minimum of five aeons over the course of the game, and three additional aeons can be unlocked by completing various sidequests.

Originally, ''Final Fantasy X'' was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters.<ref name="battleandvoice">{{cite book | author=Birlew, Dan | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide | pages=268 | publisher = BradyGAMES Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 0-7440-0140-4}}</ref> Battle art director [[Shintaro Takai]] has explained that it was his intention that battles in ''Final Fantasy X'' come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element.<ref name="interviews" /> However, due to hardware and system limitations, these ideas were not used until ''Final Fantasy XI'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field screen to battle arenas were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game.

===Sphere Grid===
[[Image:FFXspheregridexample3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A portion of the Sphere Grid]]
''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s leveling system, the Sphere Grid, was unique in the [[computer role-playing game]] genre at the time of its release; however aspects of the approach were adopted by some later titles, for example the "Mantra Grid" in the game [[Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga]].  Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after a certain number of battles, each character gains a "sphere level" after collecting enough [[experience point|Ability Points]] (AP). Sphere levels, in turn, allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a predetermined grid of several hundred interconnected nodes consisting of various stat and ability bonuses. Items called "spheres" (obtained from defeated enemies, treasure chests, and event prizes) are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character. In this way, the playable characters' development resembles a [[board game]].

Producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand.<ref name="spheregrid">{{cite book | author=Birlew, Dan | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide | pages=266 | publisher=BradyGAMES Publishing | language=English | id=ISBN 0-7440-0140-4}}</ref> The Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the magician Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman Auron into a healer. The ''International'' and [[PAL]] versions of the game include an optional "Expert" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a tradeoff, however, the Expert grid has noticeably fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.

{{main|Spira (Final Fantasy)}}
[[Image:Map23cx.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Map of Spira]]
The world of ''Final Fantasy X'' is known as "Spira". It consists of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical [[Locations in Spira#Besaid Island|Besaid]] and [[Locations in Spira#Kilika Island|Kilika]] islands to the temperate [[Locations in Spira#Mi'ihen Highroad|Mi'ihen]] region to the frigid [[Locations in Spira#Macalania|Macalania]] and [[Locations in Spira#Mount Gagazet|Mount Gagazet]].

Although it is predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the [[Races of Final Fantasy#Al Bhed|Al Bhed]], a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive spiral-green eyes and unique [[Al Bhed language|language]]. The [[Races of Final Fantasy#Guado|Guado]] are somewhat less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other subtle differences. They also have a natural propensity for magic and conjuring monsters. Still less human in appearance are the large, lion-like, one-horned [[Races of Final Fantasy#Ronso|Ronso]], and the frog-like [[Races of Final Fantasy#Hypello|Hypello]].

Spira's wildlife population introduces several new concepts into the series. Although most creatures are drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds and butterflies, a few fictional species appear, such as the gigantic, amphibious [[Final Fantasy bestiary (N-Z)#Shoopuf|shoopuf]] and the [[emu]]-like [[Chocobo#Final Fantasy X|chocobo]]. Both are used primarily for transportation purposes. Most other unusual creatures encountered in ''Final Fantasy X'' are ''[[Monsters of Final Fantasy|fiends]]''.

Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, being much more closely modeled on [[Southeast Asia]], most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names. Nomura has identified the [[Australasia|South Pacific]], [[Thailand]] and [[Japan]] as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic locations of Besaid and Kilika.<ref name="interviews" /> He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past ''Final Fantasy'' games most notably in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Though a southeast Asian theme is dominant, like other games in the franchise, ''Final Fantasy X'' borrows elements from many other cultures, featuring references to [[demonology]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Arabian mythology|Arabic]] and other [[mythology|mythologies]]. [[Psychology]] is also represented, with [[Carl Jung]] referenced by the [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Aeons and fayth|aeon Anima]].

===Spirituality and metaphysics===
[[Image:Farplane.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A screenshot of the Farplane, resting place of the [[soul]]-like pyreflies]]
The most distinctive, basic features of ''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[mythology]] are [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Pyreflies|pyreflies]], luminescent "bundles of life energy" that emerge from the newly-dead and wander the land.<ref name="ult_scen">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Scenario Ultimania | pages=59 | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | language=Japanese | id=ISBN 4-88787-010-8}}</ref> If left to their own devices, they usually cluster together and form into ''fiends'', dangerous monsters that take a variety of forms and return to balls of pyreflies when defeated. The vast majority of enemies in ''Final Fantasy X'' are fiends. In rare cases, pyreflies maintain enough cohesion and sentience to become ''[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Unsent|unsent]]'', beings that appear human but are actually the lingering remnant of a dead individual with a purpose left unfinished.

One of the tasks of a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]] in ''Final Fantasy X'' is to help guide stray pyreflies to their final resting place, a mystical domain guarded by the Guado and known as the [[Locations in Spira#Farplane|Farplane]]. They do this through a ritual dance known as "[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Death and afterlife|the sending]]". The other chief function of summoners is to summon ''[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Aeons and fayth|aeons]]'', fierce magical creatures created when people sacrifice their lives to encase their souls within statues, becoming ''[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Aeons and fayth|fayth]]''. Fayth grant summoners the ability to summon their respective aeons, which are described as "dreams of the fayth". Summoners are charged with the duty of defeating Sin, a gigantic monster that has plagued Spira for a thousand years, capable of wiping out entire towns and armies with ease.

Spira's human population is deeply religious and centered around the [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Yevon|temples of Yevon]], a millennium-old religious organization that has gained enormous influence. The Yevonite temples consider Sin a divine punishment set upon people for their pride in the use of machines (or ''machina'', as they are called in the game),<ref name="sinandrepentence">'''Tidus:''' Yuna, why does Sin always come back? / '''Yuna:''' Sin is our punishment for our vanity. And it will not go away until we've atoned. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> and forbid the use of advanced technology. However, it is eventually revealed that the highest priests, known as the ''[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Hierarchy of the temples|maesters]]'', have become increasingly corrupt and unfaithful to their own doctrine, making use of ''machina'' to increase their power.

Summoners go on [[pilgrimage]]s to gather aeons and increase their powers. They are accompanied by [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Militant factions|guardians]], trained fighters whose duty is to protect the summoners and assist them along the way. The end of the pilgrimage is in the sacred ruined city of [[Locations in Spira#Zanarkand Ruins|Zanarkand]], where summoners acquire the [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Legacy of Yevon|Final Aeon]], the only known power that can destroy Sin. It is revealed late in ''Final Fantasy X'' that the fayth for the Final Aeon is actually created from one who is personally close to a summoner, requiring a guardian of each summoner who defeats Sin to sacrifice his or her life.<ref name="sacrifice">'''Yunalesca:''' You must choose the one whom I will change... to become the fayth of the Final Summoning. There must be a bond, between chosen and summoner, for that is what the Final Summoning embodies: the bond between husband and wife, mother and child, or between friends.  If that bond is strong enough, its light will conquer Sin. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Additionally, using the Final Aeon against Sin costs the summoner's life as well.<ref name="death">'''Tidus:''' Why couldn't they trust guardians to protect summoners... The Al Bhed had no right stopping their pilgrimage! / '''Rikku:''' The pilgrimages have to stop! If they don't, and they get to Zanarkand... They might defeat Sin. Yunie could... but then she... Yunie will die, you know? You know, don't you? Summoners journey to get the Final Aeon. Yuna told you, didn't she? With the Final Aeon, she can beat Sin... but then... If she calls it, then the Final Aeon's gonna kill her.  Even if she defeats Sin, it will kill Yunie too, you know? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> However, even this measure is only temporary: after a small period of peace, known as "the Calm",<ref name="calm">'''Tidus:''' What's the calm? / '''Lulu:''' The Calm is a time of peace. It comes after a summoner defeats Sin, and lasts until Sin reappears. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Sin returns, thus requiring the process to start anew.

===Story===
[[Image:Sin2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A side image of Sin]]
''Final Fantasy X'' begins late in the story, with the main character, [[Tidus]], waiting with his allies outside the ruined city of Zanarkand.  From this ''[[in medias res]]'' beginning, Tidus proceeds to narrate the series of events leading up to his present situation, and this extended flashback sequence spans most of the game's storyline. It begins in an unruined Zanarkand, a high-tech [[metropolis]] and Tidus' home city, where he is a renowned star of the fictional underwater sport [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Blitzball|blitzball]]. When Zanarkand is suddenly attacked by Sin during a blitzball game, Tidus &mdash; along with his long-time mentor, Auron &mdash; is sucked into the creature and awakens to find himself alone in the ruins of a deserted temple.

Tidus is then rescued by Al Bhed divers in the area, and one of them, Rikku, tells him that Zanarkand had been destroyed one thousand years earlier. He has little time to dwell on the significance of this news before [[Characters of Final Fantasy X#Sin|Sin]] attacks once again, separating Tidus from the others. He eventually washes up on the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, the captain of the Besaid Aurochs, a blitzball team. Impressed by Tidus' blitzball skills, Wakka asks Tidus to join the Aurochs in an upcoming tournament in [[Locations in Spira#Luca|Luca]], suggesting that he may meet someone he knows there.

Tidus is introduced to Yuna, a young summoner who is following in the footsteps of her deceased father, the [[List of Final Fantasy X characters|High Summoner Braska]], who temporarily vanquished Sin ten years earlier. Braska's guardians were Auron and [[Jecht]], Tidus's missing father, who had been assumed dead at sea ten years earlier.<ref name="jecht">'''Zanar:''' I was in a coffee shop, running away from home when I heard the news.  Our hero, Jecht, gone, vanished into thin air! .../ '''Zanar:''' Anyway... Ten years later, the Jecht Memorial Cup tournament is today! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="jecht2">'''Tidus:''' Sounds like him, but it can't be him. / '''Yuna:''' Why not? / '''Tidus:''' My old man, he died. Ten years ago, off the coast of Zanarkand. / '''Yuna:''' I'm sorry. / '''Tidus:''' He went out to sea for training one day... and never came back. And no one's seen him since then. / '''Yuna:''' Why, that's the day that Jecht came to Spira. It's true! I first met Jecht ten years and three months ago! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Tidus also meets Lulu and Kimahri, who, along with Wakka, are to serve as Yuna's guardians, journeying with her on her pilgrimage to the ruins of Zanarkand. There, she plans to acquire the power to summon the "Final Aeon" and use it to defeat Sin.

[[Image:FFXRedCarpet.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|left|250px|A screenshot of Yuna's guardians launching a rescue attempt at her wedding with Seymour]]
The party travels by boat to [[Locations in Spira#Kilika Island|Kilika Island]] &mdash; where Sin is encountered yet again, decimating most of the town and its villagers &mdash; and then to Luca. After the blitzball tournament, the party encounters Auron, who joins them. Not long after, following another encounter with Sin where a [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Militant factions|crusader]] fleet is decimated, they are joined by Rikku, who is revealed to be Yuna's cousin.<ref name="cousins">'''Rikku:''' Hey, do I look like Yunie, you think? / '''Tidus:''' (Huh?) / '''Rikku:''' Well, my dad's sister is Yunie's mother, you get it? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

The party also encounters Seymour Guado, the leader of the Guado and a maester of Yevon, while in Luca. Although he initially presents himself as an ally, it later becomes apparent that he is an enemy who wishes to become Sin, so that he may use its power to kill everyone in Spira in what he believes to be an act of compassion. For this reason, he attempts to force Yuna to marry him, so that he may become her Final Aeon, and thus transform into Sin.<ref name="merge">'''Seymour:''' Death is a sweet slumber. All the pain of life is gently swept away... Ah, yes. So you see... if all life were to end in Spira, all suffering would end.  Don't you see? Do you not agree? That, Yuna, is why I need you. I will take from you your strength, Yuna, your life, and become the next Sin. I will destroy Spira! I will save it! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Although Seymour is killed after his first battle with Yuna's guardians, he becomes an Unsent and attacks the party again many times.

Around the same time, Tidus becomes increasingly fond of Yuna, but discovers, to his horror, that if she completes her pilgrimage and uses the Final Aeon against Sin, she will die. Aware of her fate, Yuna intends to give her life to provide the people of Spira with the Calm, the brief period of peace that follows Sin's destruction. Complicating matters further, Auron reveals to Tidus that his father Jecht is alive, but no longer human, having now himself become the unwilling embodiment of Sin.<ref name="sinisjecht">'''Tidus:''' Is he alive? / '''Auron:''' It depends on what you mean by "alive." He is no longer human. But then... I felt something of Jecht there in that shell, couldn't you? You must have felt him when you came in contact with Sin. / '''Tidus:''' It can't be... / '''Auron:''' It is. Sin is Jecht. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=2001-12-20 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Tidus resolves to find a way to free his estranged father and permanently destroy Sin without sacrificing Yuna's life.

Inside Sin, the party battles Seymour, Jecht's imprisoned spirit, and Yu Yevon, defeating each and sending their spirits to the Farplane. Thus, they are able to end Sin's cycle of rebirth forever. Auron dissipates and goes to the Farplane as well, having fulfilled his promise to Jecht and Braska to guard their children. Lastly, the spirits of all the fayth of Spira are freed from their imprisonment, dispersing the aeons, Dream Zanarkand, and Tidus in the process. Although Yuna mourns the loss of Tidus, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, she resolves to help rebuild the world now that it is free of Sin. However, she asks that they never forget the people who have been lost along the way.

==Development==
[[Image:Ffxformerlogo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The former logo of the game, as shown in 2000]]
Development for ''Final Fantasy X'' began in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]], costing approximately 4 billion [[Japanese yen]] (approximately [[United States Dollar|$]]32.3 million)<ref name="cost">{{cite web | author=Long, Andrew | year=2001 | title=Financial Fantasy X | url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/071201c.html | work=[http://rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessmonthday=April 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> with a crew of more than one hundred people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series.

As with most other games in the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise, the characters and story of ''Final Fantasy X'' are distinct from those of its predecessors. Executive producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] states that this is to maintain the novelty of each title and to show off his team's true potential. Although he had certain reservations about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, Sakaguchi believes ''Final Fantasy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things.<ref name="interviews" /> For his part, scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] has said that with this installment of the series, he was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between the player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that<U+2014>since both Tidus and the player find themselves in a new world<U+2014>the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own developing understanding and narration.<ref name="interviews" />

''Final Fantasy X'' also features innovations in the rendering of facial expressions on characters, achieved through [[motion capture]] and [[skeletal animation]] technology.<ref name="interviews" /><ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | author=Metacritic staff | title=Final Fantasy X (ps2: 2001): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/finalfantasyx?q=Final%20Fantasy%20X | work=[http://www.metacritic.com/ Metacritic] | accessmonthday=April 26 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors.

==Audio==
===Voice-overs===
Nojima also revealed that the inclusion of [[voice-over]]s had a substantial impact on the writing of the game's story. He has explained that the presence of voice actors allowed him to maintain a more simple method of storytelling, as the range of emotions that could be expressed through them was greater than that provided by text alone. Nojima has further revealed that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the story and characters themselves, so as to solidify the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying.<ref name="voices">{{cite web | author=GameSpot staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X - PlayStation 2 News at GameSpot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/news.html?sid=2829055&mode=all&page=2&q= | work=[http://gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessmonthday=April 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In some respects, however, the inclusion of voice-overs led to additional difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] voice work, ''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[English language|English]] localization team faced not only the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue, but also the added obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the previously established rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. In his words, lead localization specialist [[Alexander O. Smith]] described the process of "fitting natural-sounding English speech into [...] the high-polygon scenes and CG movies" as "something akin to writing four or five movies worth of dialogue entirely in [[haiku]] form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints". To this end, each voice actor was briefed on their character's motivations and feelings for every scene, and also shown various scenes from the game itself.<ref name="battleandvoice" />

===Musical score===
{{main|Final Fantasy X albums}}
''Final Fantasy X'' marks the first time [[Nobuo Uematsu]] has had any assistance in composing the score for a ''Final Fantasy'' game. His fellow composers for ''Final Fantasy X'' were [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]].

The game includes three songs with vocalized elements, one of which is the [[J-pop]] ballad "[[Suteki Da Ne]]". It is sung by Japanese folk singer [[RIKKI|Ritsuki Nakano]] (also known as "RIKKI"), whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere.<ref name="interviews" /> "Suteki Da Ne" is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of ''Final Fantasy X''. The song's title translates to "Isn't it Beautiful?" in English, and its lyrics were written by Nojima,<ref name="interviews" /> while Uematsu composed the instrumentals. Like the ballads from ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''IX'', "Suteki Da Ne" has an in-game version together with an orchestrated version used as part of the ending theme. The other songs featuring lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, "Otherworld", sung in English by singer Bill Muir, and the "[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Practices|Hymn of the Fayth]]", a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.

==Reception==
''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reception was largely positive, with high sales figures and critical acclaim from the gaming industry. The game sold 90% of its initial 2,140,000-unit shipment <U+2014> 1,926,000 units <U+2014> within just the first four days of release in Japan, having already sold between 1.4 million and 1.5 million copies in [[pre-order]]s.<ref name="pre-orders">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Sells Like Crazy; World Not Shocked | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/096/096716p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessmonthday=April 26 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> These figures exceeded the performances of ''Final Fantasy IX'' and ''Final Fantasy VII'' in a comparable period,<ref name="sales">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Approaches 2 Million Copies Sold | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/096/096825p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessmonthday=March 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''Final Fantasy X'' became the first PlayStation 2 game to reach sales totals of 2 million and 4 million copies.<ref name="PS22million">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=FFX Tops Sales Charts | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/100/100730p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessmonthday=April 26 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="PS24million">{{cite web | author=Varanini, Giancarlo | year=2002 | title=Final Fantasy X sales meet expectations | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/news.html?sid=2843955 | work=[http://www.gamespot.com GameSpot] | accessmonthday=May 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Once among the top twenty best-selling console games of all time, as of March 2006, the game's consistent sales have earned it the position of the second best-selling ''Final Fantasy'' game.<!--, with worldwide shipments of 7.93 million copies.

===Critical response===
Both Japanese and western critics have generally given ''Final Fantasy X'' high scores, with the game attaining a 92/100 ("universal acclaim") according to [[Metacritic]].<ref name="metacritic"/> A leading Japanese video game magazine, ''[[Famitsu]]'', awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score,<ref name="famitsuandtheplaystation">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Gets Rated in Japan | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/096/096564p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessdaymonth=26 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> while readers of the same magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006.<ref name="famitsureaders">{{cite web | author=Campbell, Colin | year=2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2401&Itemid=2 | work=[http://www.next-gen.biz Next Generation] | accessmonthday=March 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Another leading Japanese gaming magazine, ''The Play Station'', gave the game a score of 29/30.<ref name="famitsuandtheplaystation" />

As part of their reviews, ''Famitsu'' and ''The Play Station'' expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline and graphics, as did the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Video game magazine|magazine]] ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''. However, the magazine only gave the game a 6/10, describing it as "Sequential software that labels itself next-gen" without providing a next generation gaming experience, instead repeating "the mistakes ... made on the last version".<ref name="edge">{{Cite book | year=2002 | editor=Editors of Edge magazine | title=Edge February 2002; issue 107 | pages=76<U+2013>77 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> In this regard, ''Edge'' cites the game's battle and character-leveling systems, describing the former as only "fractionally more complex" than was the case in previous installments of the series, and the latter as "[no] more flexible than the straight leveling from previous games".<ref name="edge" /> ''Edge'' also dealt harsh criticism to the game's English script and voice-overs, regarding the dialogue, "both textual and verbal", as "nauseating". The magazine went on to say that it "renders the pathos comedic, the comedy dead, and ... butchers the whole game".<ref name="edge" />

Multimedia website [[IGN]] felt that the game was too linear and disliked the pacing of the story, citing the game's few puzzle-based scenarios as poorly integrated with the rest of the game. Despite these negative criticisms, the website offered extensive praise for the game's innovations in gameplay, particularly with regard to the revised battle and summon magic system, the option to change party members during battle, and what they felt were more efficient character development and inventory management systems. Offering additional praise for the game's graphics, which they suggested "improves on its predecessors in every area possible", they commented that the game as a whole was "the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well" at the time of release.<ref name="ignreview" />

===Legacy===
Due to its commercial and popular success,<ref name="connectionandsequel">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania <U+03A9> | pages=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-88787-021-3}}</ref><ref name="sequel">{{cite web | author=Jeremy Dunham | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Developer Interview | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessmonthday=April 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Square Enix released a direct sequel to ''Final Fantasy X'' in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]], entitled "''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''". This sequel<U+2014>the first direct sequel developed in the ''Final Fantasy'' series<U+2014>is set two years after the conclusion of the original story, establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Also as a result of the game's reception, Kitase and Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between ''Final Fantasy X'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', another popular ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref name="connectionandsequel" />

The advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with ''Final Fantasy X'' through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with its sequel and other subsequent titles <U+2014> such as ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' and ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'' <U+2014> also featuring this development. Additionally, traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series, as demonstrated in both ''Final Fantasy XI'' and ''Final Fantasy XII''.
<!--
Final Fantasy X also inspired the masterpiece of [[Mario Petillo]], an Italian writer, that analyzed the history of [[Tidus]] in "a Dream: a Break from the World" (un Sogno: una Pausa dal Mondo), and from the [[Omega Weapon]], monster of the game, created the figure of [http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_di_Djose Omega of Djose], that aroused more than few criticisms in Italy.
