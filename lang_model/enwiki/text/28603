The '''Church of Our Saviour''' is a historic [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] parish in the village of [[Mechanicsburg, Ohio|Mechanicsburg]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  Founded in the 1890s, it is one of the youngest congregations in the village, but its [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]-style [[church (building)|church building]] that was constructed soon after the parish's creation has been named a [[historic site]].

==Organic history==
The first settlers in [[Goshen Township, Champaign County, Ohio|Goshen Township]] arrived circa 1805,<ref name=beers>''The History of Champaign County, Ohio''.  [[Chicago]]: Beers, 1881.</ref>{{rp|586}} and Mechanicsburg was [[plat]]ted on 6 August 1814.<ref name=beers />{{rp|596}}  Organized religion was rare in the earliest years; the first churches were established by [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit-riding]] preachers from the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], who founded small religious classes that met in settlers' log cabins.<ref name=beers />{{rp|591}}  Mechanicsburg's first church was a Methodist congregation organized in 1814,<ref name=beers />{{rp|598}} and by the 1880s the village boasted four additional churches: [[Baptists|Baptist]], [[black church|black Baptist]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal]], and [[Methodist Protestant Church|Methodist Protestant]].<ref name=beers />{{rp|600}}

[[Champaign County, Ohio|Champaign County's]] first Protestant Episcopal church was the Church of the Epiphany on the [[Scioto Street Historic District|eastern side]] of the [[county seat]] of [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]]; it was created in 1847,<ref name=middleton>Middleton, Evan P., ed.  ''History of Champaign County Ohio: Its People, Industries and Institutions.''  Vol. 1.  [[Indianapolis]]: Bowen, 1917.</ref>{{rp|512}} nearly fifty years before a parish was formed in Mechanicsburg.  Under the leadership of a five-man executive committee, the Church of Our Saviour was organized in 1892; the parish saw its first church building completed in the following year,<ref name=middleton />{{rp|513}} although 1894 arrived before the building was dedicated.<ref name=ware>Ware, Joseph.  ''History of Mechanicsburg, Ohio''.  [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]: Heer, 1917.</ref>{{rp|48}}  The first priest was F.V. Baer, and by the end of the 1890s, the members had bought an additional [[land lot|lot]] and were preparing to build a new [[rectory]] upon it.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=W53VAAAAMAAJ Journal of the Twenty-fifth Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Southern Ohio, Held in All Saint's Church, Portsmouth, May 17-18, 1899]''.  [[Cincinnati]]: Carpenter, 1899, 79.</ref>  Although the early members remained loyal to their church, it was frequently weakened by deaths and movement away from the community in its early years.  Nevertheless, the parish remained active, and its presence was welcomed by Mechanicsburg's other churches;<ref name=ware />{{rp|48}} within its first quarter-century of existence, the members formed an active [[Sunday school]] and founded multiple organizations for the female members.<ref name=middleton />{{rp|513}}

==Architecture==
Constructed in 1893,<ref name=middleton />{{rp|513}} dedicated in 1894,<ref name=ware />{{rp|48}} and rededicated in 1895,<ref name=middleton />{{rp|513}} the Church of Our Saviour is a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] structure.<ref name=nris />  In its early years, its [[pipe organ]], brass [[Altar#Anglican_churches|altar]], and windows were deemed its most distinctive elements,<ref name=middleton />{{rp|513}} all of which prompted a local author to declare that "both the exterior and interior are very attractive" in 1907.<ref name=ware />{{rp|48}}  Built of brick on a stone [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and featuring elements of wood and stone,<ref>[http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/ohpo/nr/details.aspx?refnum=85001878 Church of Our Savior], [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.

The windows that attracted the attention of authors in the early twentieth century are [[stained glass]]; most are [[ogive|ogive windows]], but the center of the facade features a [[rose window]].  A square brick tower with a wooden [[Bell tower|belfry]] sits at one corner of the building; additional stained glass windows are placed in the tower, and ornamental wooden carvings adorn the belfry.<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 1.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 113-114.</ref>  Architecturally, it is not unique; three of Mechanicsburg's five historic church buildings were constructed in the 1890s,<ref name=mps>Recchie, Nancy.  ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Mechanicsburg Multiple Resource Area''.  [[National Park Service]], December 1984.</ref>{{rp|6}} and four of the five are brick buildings with stained-glass ogive windows.<ref name=mps />{{rp|2}}

==Recent history==
The Church of Our Saviour was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.  It was part of a [[multiple property submission]] of approximately twenty buildings,<ref name=nris /> scattered throughout the village in such a low concentration that a [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]] designation was not practical.<ref name=mps />{{rp|8}}  While many of the other twenty Mechanicsburg buildings were houses, four were the village's other historic churches: the [[Mechanicsburg Baptist Church]], [[St. Michael's Catholic Church (Mechanicsburg, Ohio)|St. Michael's Catholic Church]], the [[Second Baptist Church (Mechanicsburg, Ohio)|Second Baptist Church]], and the [[United Methodist Church (Mechanicsburg, Ohio)|United Methodist Church]].  Like all four of the others, the Church of Our Saviour qualified for inclusion on the Register because of its historically significant architecture.<ref name=nris />

A member parish of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the Church of Our Saviour is within the jurisdiction of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio|Diocese of Southern Ohio]].
