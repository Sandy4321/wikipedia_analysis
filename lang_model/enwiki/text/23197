'''Britt Dillmann''' (born 4 April 1963) is a [[1 point player|1.0-point]] [[wheelchair basketball]] [[Forward (basketball)|forward]], who plays for RSV Lahn-Dill in the German wheelchair basketball league. She has also played for the national team, winning a silver medal at the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]]. She retired soon afterwards, but staged a comeback in 2011, rejoining the national team, which went on to win the European championships, and then a gold medal at the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London. [[President of Germany|President]] [[Joachim Gauck]] awarded the team Germany's highest sporting honour, the ''[[Silbernes Lorbeerblatt]]'' (Silver Laurel Leaf).

==Biography==
Britt Tuna was born on 4 April 1963.<ref name="London 2012"/> She played [[wheelchair basketball]] for RSV Lahn-Dill, and the German national team which won the [[European Wheelchair Basketball Championship]] in 1987.<ref name="The History of RSV Lahn-Dill"/> At the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Seoul]], Tuna was considered to be the strongest [[wheelchair basketball]] player in her [[1 point player|1.0-point]] class. The German team went through the [[Wheelchair basketball at the 1988 Summer Paralympics|tournament]] undefeated until the final match, which they lost to the United States, 38<U+2013>31.<ref name="The 50th Anniversary of Wheelchair Basketball"/> Tuna was bitter about the defeat, which she blamed on a tactical error by the German coach.<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/> She later conceded, "''So habe ihr diese Niederlage noch <U+00FC>ber Jahre nachgehangen''" ("I indulged in this defeat for many years").<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/>

In the early 1990s, Tuna quit basketball to focus on her work. She married,<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/> changing her surname to Dillmann,<ref name="Zeltinger Premiere <U+2013> Dillmann Comeback"/> and raised three children.<ref name="Subtil benachteiligt"/> But in the summer of 2009, Dillmann felt that she had become overweight and unfit. A [[low-carbohydrate diet]] and daily exercise at the gym, in the pool, and on the [[handcycle]], saw her weight drop by {{convert|30|kg}} in a year.<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/><ref name="Alterspr<U+00E4>sidentin"/>

Dillmann then decided to try wheelchair basketball again. She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat mouldy and smelly, from the basement, and sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill. Her debut game with the [[Reserve team|seconds]] saw the [[Official (basketball)|basketball officials]] reaching for their rulebooks to see if the old chair, of a type they had never seen, was still legal.<ref name="Alterspr<U+00E4>sidentin"/>

Although RSV Lahn-Dill, eager to develop young players, would only let her play in the seconds, Dillmann caught the attention of national coach Holger Glinicki, who was looking for a top-notch 1.0-point player. In 2010, she rejoined the national team that she had played on before many of her new teammates were born. The team went on to win the European Championships in 2011.<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/><ref name="Alterspr<U+00E4>sidentin"/> Dillmann's treatment contrasted with that of national team mate [[Gesche Sch<U+00FC>nemann]]. While Sch<U+00FC>nemann received endorsements and could train in the hall of RSV Lahn-Dill's Rivers Barracks, Dillmann got none, and trained outdoors.<ref name="Subtil benachteiligt"/>

In June 2012 she was named as one of the team that competed at the [[2012 Summer Paralympic Games]] in London.<ref name="Rolling Planet 2011"/> At the age of 49, she was the oldest wheelchair basketball player there.<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/><ref name="60 Olympioniken"/> In the Gold Medal match, the team faced the [[Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team]],<ref name="Germany claim women's crown"/> a team that had beaten them 48<U+2013>46 in Sydney just a few months before.<ref name="Victory for Rollers and Gliders as London Awaits"/> They defeated the Australians 44<U+2013>58 in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the [[North Greenwich Arena]] to win the gold medal,<ref name="Germany claim women's crown"/> the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball in 28 years.<ref name="Team of the Year 2012"/> They were awarded a Silver Laurel Leaf by president [[Joachim Gauck]] in November 2012,<ref name="Silver Leaf 2012"/> and were again named Team of the Year for 2012.<ref name="Team of the Year 2012"/> For Dillmann, the gold medal victory removed the pain of the loss 24 years before.<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/> "''Das hat mich vers<U+00F6>hnt mit Seoul''" ("This has reconciled me with Seoul") she said.<ref name="Die <U+00C4>lteste z<U+00E4>hlt zu den Besten"/>
