'''Pennsylvania Route 283''' ('''PA Route 283''' or '''PA 283''', officially '''State Route 300''' or '''SR 300''' due to the presence of [[Interstate 283]]) is a {{convert|29|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. It connects [[Harrisburg (PA)|Harrisburg]] to [[Lancaster (PA)|Lancaster]] as a [[freeway]], paralleling the old [[U.S. Route 230]] (now partly [[Pennsylvania Route 230]]). The number was assigned based on the proximity of [[Interstate 283]], but [[Interstate 283]] and PA 283 are not the same roadway; the two intersect at a [[cloverleaf interchange]].  Because the road is built to [[Interstate Highway standards|Interstate Standards]], it is one of the few non-interstate designated highways in [[Pennsylvania]] with a posted [[Speed Limit]] of {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for a considerable distance.

==Route description==
===Dauphin County===
[[Image:Route 283 sign.jpg|thumb|right|250px|PA 283 [[reassurance shield]].]]
PA 283 begins at an intersection with Eisenhower Boulevard (Quadrant Route 3001) near [[Highspire, Pennsylvania|Highspire]] that connects to [[Pennsylvania Route 230]]. PA 283 is one of few Pennsylvania Highways to end at a Quadrant Route. From there, PA 283 intersects [[Interstate 283]] at exit 1 and [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] ([[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]) at exit 247 ([[Harrisburg, PA|Harrisburg]] East exit) at a [[cloverleaf interchange]]. East of I-283 and I-76, PA 283 is a {{convert|29|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[freeway]]. In [[Lower Swatara Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Swatara Township]], PA 283 has an exit to a freeway road (Quadrant Route 3032) that connects to [[Harrisburg International Airport]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 441]]. This exit has access to [[Penn State Harrisburg]]. East of PA 441, PA 283 has an exit to Union Street and Fulling Mill Road which are detours to PA 441. After crossing the [[Swatara Creek]] and entering [[Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania|Londonderry Township]], PA 283 has an exit to [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]] on Vine Street. In [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]], PA 283 passes over I-76/PA Turnpike and [[Pennsylvania Route 341]]. The next exit is an exit that leads to both PA 341 and [[Pennsylvania Route 230|PA 230]].

===Lancaster County===
[[Image:Route 283 Begin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|PA 283 begins and splits from [[U.S. Route 30]].]]
The first exit in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] is an exit to [[Pennsylvania Route 743]]. Just east of PA 743, PA 283 passes over [[Pennsylvania Route 241]]. In [[Mount Joy, Pennsylvania|Mount Joy]], PA 283 has an exit to [[Rheems (PA)|Rheems]] and [[Elizabethtown (PA)|Elizabethtown]]. In [[Rapho Township, Pennsylvania|Rapho Township]], PA 283 interchanges with [[Pennsylvania Route 772]]. The next exit is split up into two interchanges that lead to the eastern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 230|PA 230]] on the Harrisburg Pike. (East of here, PA 283 has a narrow median strip as it is using old Route 230.) In [[East Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania|East Hempfield Township]], PA 283 interchanges with Spooky Nook Road to [[Salunga (PA)|Salunga]]. The next exit is a [[diamond interchange]] with the western terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 722]]. In [[Manheim Township, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]], PA 283 interchanges with [[Pennsylvania Route 741]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 72]]. PA 283 terminates (ends) at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 30]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. The first exit is to US 30 west, then the second exit is to Fruitville Pike, and the final exit is to US 30 east.<ref name=pamap>Pennsylvania Tourism and Transportation Map</ref><ref name=rmap>Rand Mcnally 2007 Atlas</ref>
==History==
This designation has moved around southeast [[Pennsylvania]] many times.  From [[1928]] to [[1946]], the route was marked between Monacacy and Monacacy Station in [[Berks County]]. 
In [[1949]], the section from the [[Mount Joy, Pennsylvania|Mount Joy]] interchange to [[Pennsylvania Route 72|PA 72]] opened.  In 1951, construction began on the section from PA 72 to [[U.S. Route 30|US 30]], and opened in [[1952]].

In [[1971]], the designation was revived for the [[Harrisburg, PA|Harrisburg]]-to-[[Lancaster, PA|Lancaster]] expressway project.  In [[1972]], the section from Eisenhower Boulevard to [[Pennsylvania Route 743|PA 743]] opened to traffic and marked the completion of the expressway.<ref name="pamap"/>
