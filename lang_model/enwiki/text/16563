The '''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''Habsburg Empire''') covered the territories ruled by the junior [[Austria]]n branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] (1278<U+2013>1780), and then by the successor House of [[Habsburg-Lorraine]] (since 1780), between 1526 and 1867/1918. The capital was mainly [[Vienna]], except from 1583 to 1611,<ref name=HHus/> when the capital was [[Prague]]. The monarchy from 1804 to 1867 is usually referred to as the "[[Austrian Empire]]" and from 1867 to 1918 as "[[Austria-Hungary]]".

The head of the House of Habsburg was usually also the ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1440 until [[Peace of Pressburg#Fourth|its dissolution in 1806]]. However, the two entities should not be considered [[wikt:coterminous|coterminous]], as the Habsburg Empire covered many lands beyond the Holy Roman Empire, and not all of the Holy Roman Empire was ''de facto'' under direct Habsburg control at any given time. In some contexts, the term "Habsburg Empire" might also refer to extended Habsburg family possessions once ruled solely by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], or to the [[Spanish Empire]] ruled by the senior [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish branch]] of the house.

The Habsburg family originated with the ''Habsburg Castle'' in modern Switzerland and after 1278 came to rule in [[Austria]] (''the Habsburg Hereditary Lands''). The Habsburg family grew to European prominence with the marriage and adoption treaty by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] at the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515 and the subsequent death of adopted Louis II (King of Bohemia and Hungary) in 1526.<ref name="HHus">

== Terminology ==
[[File:Habsburg Map 1547b.jpg|thumb|300px|Habsburg possessions at one of her largest extends under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V.]] in 1547.]]
Names of the territory that (with some exceptions) finally became [[Austria-Hungary]]:
*'''[[Habsburg monarchy]]''' or '''[[Austrian monarchy]]''' (1526<U+2013>1867): This was an unofficial, but very frequent name <U+2013> even at that time. The entity had no [[Official#Official as an adjective|official name]]. Note that technically the term "Habsburg monarchy" can also refer to the period 1276<U+2013>1918 when the Habsburgs ruled in the monarchy ([[archduchy]]) centered in present-day Austria and "Austrian monarchy" can refer to the monarchy centered in present-day Austria 1156<U+2013>1867, but both terms are usually not used this way.
*'''[[Austrian Empire]]''' (1804<U+2013>1867): This was the official name. Note that the German version is ''Kaisertum <U+00D6>sterreich'', i.e. the English translation empire refers to a territory ruled by an [[emperor]], not just to a "widespreading domain", more accurately the "Emperordom of Austria".
*'''[[Austria-Hungary]]''' or '''Austro-Hungarian Empire''' (1867<U+2013>1918): This was the official name. An unofficial popular name was the '''Danubian Monarchy''' ({{lang-de|Donaumonarchie}}) also often used was the term ''Doppel-Monarchie'' ("Double Monarchy") meaning two states under one crowned ruler.
*'''[[Crownland]]s''' or '''[[crown land]]s''' ('''''Kronl<U+00E4>nder''''') (1849<U+2013>1918): This is the name of all the individual parts of the Austrian Empire (since 1849) and then of Austria-Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the '''Lands of the Hungarian Crown''') was not considered a "crownland" anymore after the establishment of Austria-Hungary 1867, so that the "crownlands" became identical with what was called the '''Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council''' (''Die im Reichsrate vertretenen K<U+00F6>nigreiche und L<U+00E4>nder''). 
The Hungarian parts of the Empire were called "[[Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen]]" or "Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen's Crown" (''L<U+00E4>nder der Heiligen Stephans Krone'').<br />   The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called "Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown" (''L<U+00E4>nder der Wenzels-Krone'').
{{History of Austria|marginright=0em}}
Names of some smaller territories:
*'''Austrian lands''' (''<U+00D6>sterreichische L<U+00E4>nder'') or "Archduchies of Austria" (''Erzherzogt<U+00FC>mer  von  <U+00D6>sterreich'') - Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996<U+2013>1918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day "Republic of Austria" (''Republik <U+00D6>sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl<U+00E4>nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Voralrlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]], came to Austria in 1921 by a referendum from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[prince-archbishop]]s of Salzburg as an sovereign territory). 
:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state January 1, 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into "Austria above the Enns" and "Austria below the Enns" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the "War of the Bavarian Succession" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] ("[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter"), formerly part of Bavaria.
*'''Hereditary Lands''' ('''''Erblande''''' or '''''Erbl<U+00E4>nder'''''; mostly used ''<U+00D6>sterreichische Erblande'') or '''German Hereditary Lands''' (in the Austrian monarchy) or '''Austrian Hereditary Lands''' ([[Middle Ages]] <U+2013> 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the "original" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br />   In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term "Crownlands" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br />  The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol''  etc.

== Territories ==
[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy]]
The territories ruled by the branch changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs: 
*The '''Hereditary Lands''', which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]]; and in 1803 the [[Bishopric (political)|Bishopric]]s of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the Vorlande. The Hereditary provinces included:
**[[Archduchy of Austria]] ([[Upper Austria]]);
**[[Archduchy of Austria]] ([[Lower Austria]]);
**[[Duchy of Styria]];
**[[Duchy of Carinthia]];
**[[Duchy of Carniola]];
**The Adriatic port of [[Trieste]];
**[[Istria]] (although much of Istria was [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory until 1797);
**[[Gorizia and Gradisca]];
***These lands (3<U+2013>8) were often grouped together as [[Inner Austria]].
**The [[County of Tyrol]] (although the Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen dominated what would become the South Tyrol before 1803);
**The [[Vorarlberg]] (actually a collection of provinces, only united in the 19th century);
**The Vorlande, a group of territories in [[Breisgau]] and elsewhere in southwestern Germany lost in 1797 (although the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] territories ([[Sundgau]]) which had formed a part of it had been lost as early as 1648);
***Vorarlberg and the Vorlande were often grouped together as [[Further Austria]] and mostly ruled jointly with Tyrol.
**[[Grand Duchy of Salzburg]] (only after 1805);
*The '''[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]''' <U+2013> initially consisting of the five lands: [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], [[March of Moravia]], [[Silesia]], and Upper and Lower [[Lusatia]]. Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] ({{lang-cs|zemsk<U+00FD> sn<U+011B>m}}) elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] as king in 1526.
**Lusatia was ceded to [[Saxony]] in 1635.
**Most of Silesia was conquered by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1740<U+2013>1742 and the remnants which stayed under Habsburg sovereignty were ruled as [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]] (Austrian Silesia).
[[File:Hungary in the 16th century.gif|thumb|right|250px|Hungary in the 16th century]]
*The '''[[Kingdom of Hungary]]''' <U+2013> Hungary had lost some two thirds of its territory to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Princes of [[Principality of Transylvania|Transylvania]], while the Habsburgs were restricted to the western and northern fringes of the former kingdom, called '''[[Royal Hungary]]''' at that time. In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], almost the whole former kingdom came under Austrian rule, with the rest being picked up in 1718. The Kingdom of Hungary, at its fullest extent, included modern [[Hungary]] and [[Slovakia]], [[Transylvania]]<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603323/Transylvania</ref> in what is now [[Romania]], most of [[Croatia]], the [[Vojvodina]] in what is now [[Serbia]], and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], a small trans-Carpathian region now in [[Ukraine]]. Between 1718 and 1739, various other Balkan territories, including the area around [[Belgrade]] and parts of western [[Wallachia]], were also attached, but were lost following an unsuccessful war with Turkey in 1739. Much of the area bordering the Ottoman Empire was separated out from Hungarian administration and formed into the [[Military Frontier]], which was ruled directly from Vienna. Croatia and Slavonia, later Croatia-Slavoinia was an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Hungary<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/croatia</ref><ref>http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ladislaus+I</ref><ref>http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/europe_1740.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/central_europe_1786.jpg</ref>, although Slavonia fell under [[Ottoman Empire]] in the middle of the 16th century and was retaken in the early 17th century.

Over the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundo-geniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):
*[[History of Serbia|Duchy of Serbia]] (1688<U+2013>1691; [[Serbia (1718<U+2013>1739)|1718<U+2013>1739]]; [[Ko<U+010D>ina Krajina Serb rebellion|1788<U+2013>1791]]);
*The [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713<U+2013>1792);
*The [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713<U+2013>1797);
*The [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713<U+2013>1735);
*The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713<U+2013>1720);
*The [[Banat of Temesvar]] (1718<U+2013>1918) (including [[Banat Krajina]]) (ceased to exist as a separate province in 1778);
*[[Oltenia]] (1718<U+2013>1739 (de facto, 1737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as '''Valachia Caesarea'''));
*The [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720<U+2013>1735);
*The [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735<U+2013>1748);
*The [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772<U+2013>1918)
*[[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774<U+2013>1918);
*[[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795<U+2013>1809);
*[[Venetian Republic|Venetia]] (1797<U+2013>1805);
*[[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797<U+2013>1805, 1814<U+2013>1918);
*[[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814<U+2013>1859);
*[[Krak<U+00F3>w]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846<U+2013>1918);
*[[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848-1849) [[Vojvodina of Serbia and Tami<U+0161> Banat]] (1849<U+2013>1860);
*[[Sandzak|Ra<U+0161>ka region occupation]] (1878<U+2013>1913)
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878<U+2013>1918).

The boundaries of some of these territories varied over the time period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundo-geniture) Habsburg line.  The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Flag of the Habsburg Monarchy.svg|thumb|right|75px|The [[Habsburg Flag]]]]
The various Habsburg possessions never really formed a single country - each province was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, all of the provinces were not even necessarily ruled by the same person - junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at centralization began under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the long [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] which followed.

An even greater attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary, in particular, ceased to exist as a separate entity, being divided into a series of districts. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, this policy was abandoned, and after several years of experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary was given sovereignty and a parliament, with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands, often, but erroneously, referred to as "Austria," received their own central parliament (the '''Reichsrat''', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name - the '''Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council''' - shows that they remained something less than a genuine unitary state. When Bosnia and Herzegovina were annexed (after a long period of occupation and administration), they were not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, they were governed by the joint ministry of finance.

Austria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Romania]] and [[Italy]], new republics of [[Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and [[Hungary]] (the Magyar core of the old kingdom) were created, and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].

== Habsburg territories outside the Habsburg Monarchy ==
The Habsburg monarchy should not be confused with various other territories ruled at different times by members of the Habsburg dynasty. The senior Spanish line of the Habsburgs ruled over [[Spain]] and various other territories from 1516 until it became extinct in 1700. A junior line ruled over [[Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[W<U+00FC>rzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Vorlande]] from 1803 to 1805, and [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863<U+2013>1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of [[Franz Josef II]]. The daughter of Francis II, Maria Leopoldine, was married to the first emperor of Brazil, Pedro I. The arrangement resulted in a large immigration from the various people living within the borders of the Austrian Empire to Brazil.
