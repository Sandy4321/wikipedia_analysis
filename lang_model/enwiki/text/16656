==Background==

Although public concern about fallout from nuclear testing grew in the early 1950s,<ref name="ctbto">{{cite web |publisher=The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |title=History of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) |url=http://www.ctbto.org/treaty/history.html}}</ref><ref name="ortmeyer1997">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ieer.org/latest/iodnart.html |first=Pat |last=Ortmeyer |coauthors=Makhijani, Arjun |month=November/December |year=1997 |title= Let Them Drink Milk |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}</ref> fallout was discovered after the [[Trinity Test|Trinity]] test in 1945.<ref name="ortmeyer1997" /> Photographic film manufacturers would later report 'fogged' films, these were traced both to ''Trinity'' and later tests at the [[Nevada Test Site]].<ref name="ortmeyer1997" /> Intense fallout from the 1953 ''Simon'' test was documented as far as Albany, New York.<ref name="ortmeyer1997" />

The fallout from the March 1954 ''[[Castle Bravo|Bravo]]'' test in the Pacific would have "scientific, political and social implications that have continued for more than 40 years."<ref name="eisenbud1997">{{cite journal |title=Monitoring distant fallout: The role of the Atomic Energy Commission Health and Safety Laboratory during the Pacific tests, with special attention to the events following Bravo |first=Merril |last=Eisenbud |journal=Health Physics |month=July |year=1997 |volume=73 |issue=1 |url=http://www.eh.doe.gov/health/marshall/marsh/journal/rpt-2.pdf}}</ref> The multi-megaton test caused fallout to occur on the islands of Rongerik and Rongelap, and a Japanese fishing boat known as the ''[[Daigo Fukury<U+016B> Maru]]'' (Little Dragon).<ref name="eisenbud1997" /> Prior to this test, there was "insufficient" appreciation of the dangers of fallout.<ref name="eisenbud1997" />

The test became an international incident. In a PBS interview, the historian Martha Smith argued: "In Japan, it becomes a huge issue in terms of not just the government and its protest against the United States, but all different groups and all different peoples in Japan start to protest. It becomes a big issue in the media. There are all kinds of letters and protests that come from, not surprisingly, Japanese fishermen, the fishermen's wives; there are student groups, all different types of people; the protest against the Americans' use of the Pacific for nuclear testing. They're very concerned about, first of all, why the United States even has the right to be carrying out those kinds of tests in the Pacific. They're also concerned about the health and environmental impact."<ref name="pbs_smith">{{cite web |title=Martha Smith on: The Impact of the Bravo Test |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bomb/filmmore/reference/interview/marthasmith01.html}}</ref> The Prime Minister of India "voiced the heightened international concern" when he called for the elimination of all nuclear testing worldwide.<ref name="ctbto" />

== Effects ==

The effects of an underground nuclear test may vary according to factors including the depth and yield of the explosion, as well as the nature of the surrounding rock.<ref name="McEwan"/> If the test is conducted at sufficient depth, the test is said to be ''contained'', with no venting of gases or other contaminants to the environment.<ref name="McEwan"/> In contrast, if the device is buried at insufficient depth ("underburied"), then rock may be expelled by the explosion, forming a crater surrounded by ejecta, and releasing high-pressure gases to the atmosphere (the resulting crater is usually conical in profile, circular, and may range between tens to hundreds of metres in diameter and depth<ref name="Hawkins"/>). One figure used in determining how deeply the device should be buried is the ''scaled depth of burial'', or ''-burst''.<ref name="McEwan"/> This figure is calculated as the burial depth in metres divided by the [[cube root]] of the yield in kilotons. It is estimated that, in order to ensure containment, this figure should be greater than 100.<ref name="McEwan"/><ref>Hawkins and Wohletz specify a figure of 90-125.</ref>

The energy of the nuclear explosion is released in one [[microsecond]]. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres.<ref name="McEwan">{{cite book | last=McEwan | first=A. C. | chapter=Environmental effects of underground nuclear explosions | editor=Goldblat, Jozef; Cox, David | title=Nuclear Weapon Tests: Prohibition Or Limitation? | year=1988 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0198291205 | pages=75-79}}</ref> The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to melt, creating a ''melt cavity''.<ref name="Hawkins"/> The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues until the pressure has fallen sufficiently.<ref name="Hawkins"/> Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The ''crushed zone'' consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The ''cracked zone'' consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the ''zone of irreversible strain'' consists of rock deformed by the pressure.<ref name="Hawkins">{{cite web | last=Hawkins | first=Wohletz | title=Visual Inspection for CTBT Verification | year=1996 | publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |url=http://www.ees1.lanl.gov/Wohletz/LAMS-13244-MS.pdf}}</ref>

Once the pressure in the cavity has fallen below the level needed to support the overburden, the rock above the void falls into the cavity, creating a rubble ''chimney''. Depending on various factors, including the yield and characteristics of the burial, this collapse may extend to the surface. If it does, a [[subsidence crater]] is created.<ref name="Hawkins"/> Such a crater is usually bowl-shaped, and ranges in size from a few tens of metres to over a kilometre in diameter.<ref name="Hawkins"/> At the [[Nevada Test Site]], 95 percent of tests conducted at a scaled depth of burial (SDOB) of less than 150 caused surface collapse, compared with about half of tests conducted at a SDOB of less than 180.<ref name="Hawkins"/>

Other surface features may include disturbed ground, pressure ridges, faults, water movement (including changes to the water table level), rock falls, and ground slump.<ref name="Hawkins" />

Although there were early concerns about [[earthquake|earthquakes]] arising as a result of underground tests, there is no evidence that this has occurred.<ref name="McEwan"/> However, fault movements and ground fractures have been reported, and explosions often precede a series of aftershocks, thought to be a result of cavity collapse and chimney formation. In a few cases, seismic energy released by fault movements has exceeded that of the explosion itself.<ref name="McEwan"/>

==International treaties==

Signed in Moscow on August 5, 1963 by representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the Limited Test Ban Treaty agreed to ban nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, and underwater.<ref name="jfklibrary">{{cite web |title=JFK in History: Nuclear Test Ban Treaty |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Nuclear+Test+Ban+Treaty.htm |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum}}</ref> Due to the Soviet government's concern about the need for the on-site inspections, underground tests were excluded from the ban.<ref name="jfklibrary"/> 108 countries would eventually sign the treaty, with the significant exceptions of France and China.<ref name="gwu">{{cite web |title=The Making of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1958-1963 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |publisher=The George Washington University}}</ref>

By the 1990s, technologies to monitor and detect underground tests had matured to the point that tests of one kiloton or over could be detected with high probability.<ref name="gwu"/> In 1996, negotiations began under the auspices of the United Nations to develop a comprehensive test ban.<ref name="gwu"/> The resulting [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] was signed in 1996 by the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, and China.<ref name="gwu"/>
