The '''Diamond DA50 Super Star''' and '''DA50 Magnum''' are five-place single-engine composite aircraft designed by [[Diamond Aircraft Industries]].<ref name=diamond>{{cite web|url = http://www.diamondaircraft.com/aircraft/da50/index.php?sect=spec|title = DA50 Superstar Brochure|accessdate = 2008-03-18|last =[[Diamond Aircraft]] |authorlink = |year = 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223005903/http://www.diamondaircraft.com/aircraft/da50/index.php?sect=spec|archivedate = 2008-02-23}}</ref> Introduced in 2006, the project was later put on hold and the current status of the product is unknown.

==Development==
The DA50 was unofficially presented in December 2006 at a company Christmas party and is to be able to be operated with gasoline and diesel engines up to 350hp. The new five seater will have one of the largest cabins of the new generation of general aviation airplanes.<ref name=diamond/>

The avgas powered version of the DA50 is to be equipped with a single [[FADEC]]-equipped [[Continental IO-550|Continental TSIO-550-J]] powerplant with twin turbo chargers producing {{convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The plane's wingspan is currently reported as 38', 4", with overall fuselage length of 29 feet. The maximum takeoff weight is planned to be 3,527 lbs. The Diamond DA50 Super Star will be pressurized and offer a [[Ballistic Recovery Systems]] aircraft parachute system as an option.<ref name=diamond/>

The DA50 made its maiden test flight on April 4, 2007 at the [[Wiener Neustadt East Airport]], Austria.<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.diamondair.com/news/2007_04_05.php|title = Diamond Super Star makes first flight! |accessdate = 2008-03-18|last = |authorlink = |year = undated |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080225235156/http://www.diamondair.com/news/2007_04_05.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-25}}</ref> The plane made its public debut at the AERO Friedrichshafen show in Germany on April 19, 2007.

The DA50 project was put on hold in 2009 as the economy entered an extended downturn and Diamond turned all their attention to the [[Diamond D-Jet]]. It has remained in limbo to this day.<ref>Bill Cox, [http://www.flydominion.com/dominion/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Premier-Edition-Plane-Pilot-Magazine.pdf "Diamond DA40 XLS: Premier Edition"], ''Plane and Pilot'', 21 June 2011</ref>
