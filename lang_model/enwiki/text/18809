'''Alastair Graeme Lynch''' (born 19 June 1968) is an [[Australian Football League]] full forward from [[Burnie]], [[Tasmania]] who had a highly-successful career, despite chronic illness and injury.

==Fitzroy Football Club==
Selected at pick 50 from the [[Hobart Football Club]] in the [[1986 VFL Draft]], Lynch began his senior football career at [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] in [[Australian Football League season 1988|1988]]. He signed his first contract on the 5th February. He was an intimidating player in defence, playing fullback and centre half back.  In his early years his notable abilities were strong marking (his outstanding aerial abilities recognised when he won the 1989 [[Mark of the Year]] award) and heavy tackling.  His titanic battles with key forwards such as [[Tony Lockett]] were highlights, and Lockett has commented on Lynch being one of his toughest opponents.  In 1993, Fitzroy coach Robert Shaw moved Lynch to full forward, where he lead the club's goal kicking with 68 goals and won the best and fairest award. Lynch also played fullback in the 1990 Tasmanian [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] team, the first Tasmanian team to defeat Victoria in 30 years.

==Brisbane Bears==
In 1993, Lynch transferred to the Brisbane Bears. At the time, the [[Brisbane Bears]], like the Fitzroy Football Club, were experiencing lean times, but improving somewhat under the  coaching of premiership coach [[Robert Walls]]. The term of Lynch's contract, ten years, was unprecedented and at the time considered by outsiders to be a great risk for the club.

Lynch came full of promise to the Bears.  In the early years, he became a poster boy recruit for the struggling club which lacked big name players.

In his first few games of the [[1994 AFL season]] Lynch had suffered a broken collarbone and knee surgery, making him unable deliver his best.  In 1995, he contracted a mystery virus which was later revealed that he was suffering from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] which sidelined him for the entire [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]]. Some commentators believe that if Lynch had played that season, then the Bears could have won a premiership.  Others believed that Lynch contracted chronic fatigue when overtraining during his rehabilitation from injury.  Lynch was one of the first sportspeople in Australian to experiment with the [[Cryotherapy|ice bath]] which proved to assist in his recovery, and became a public figure for the illness which was struggling for credibility at the time.

In his return the following season, the Bears, struggling for forward line talent and with an increasingly talented backline, first experimented playing Lynch up forward to relieve an ageing [[Roger Merrett]] with some success.  Successive seasons saw him interchanged between the two opposite ends of the ground.

==Brisbane Lions==
When Fitzroy merged with the Bears after the [[1996 AFL season|1996 season]] to form the [[Brisbane Lions]], Lynch was made a semi-permanent forward but was unable to perform at his peak for the next two seasons due to minor recurrence of his illness.

Lynch was appointed as club co-captain with [[Michael Voss]] in 1997, a position that he held until 2000, when Voss assumed the full captaincy.

Still struggling with intermittent lapses of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in 1998, Lynch discovered that the drug he had been prescribed at the beginning of the season, although with the permission of the [[Australian Sports Drug Agency]] (official AFL drug agents) had been added to the [[IOC]] list of banned substances.  He took it upon himself to alert the AFL and was controversially charged for taking a prohibited substance before eventually being cleared.

A new beginning for Lynch and the Lions came in [[1999 AFL season|1999]], under champion coach [[Leigh Matthews]]. He played some games in defence but usually at full forward. Improvements in his strength, kicking for goal and positioning during marking contests made him one of the most feared forwards in the competition.

Endured great success for the [[2001 AFL season|2001]], [[Australian Football League season 2002|2002]], and [[2003 AFL season|2003]] seasons becoming a multiple goal kicker against the game's most prominent fullbacks including [[Stephen Silvagni]], [[Matthew Scarlett]] and [[Shane Wakelin]] from [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], Brisbane's on-going rivals. Lynch now has played in three winning premierships. In [[2004 AFL season|2004]], he was the competition's oldest player at 36 years of age.

===Retirement===

He announced his retirement after Brisbane's loss in the 2004 AFL Grand Final. Despite this disappointing end to his career. if he were to play on he would have missed ten matches after being reported for sriking Port Adelaides [[Darryl Wakelin]]. Lynch will be remembered as a player who overcame great adversity to become one of the premier players with one of the greatest teams the game of [[Australian rules football]] has seen; whose career finished in disappointing fashion getting injured in a losing grand final side, with his only statistic for the day being one free kick against.

==Post-football career==
Lynch is now enjoying his football retirement, and is spending it as a match commentator on Brisbane Lions matches with [[Triple M]] [[radio]] as well as an occasional television commentary role with the [[Fox Footy|Fox Footy Channel]]. He has also been appointed head of a new company, Healthy Business, that works alongside Nyrstar. Lynch recently made an appearance at the 104th Smelters Picnic, a show in Port Pirie, representing Healthy Business.

He has also co-written a book with Peter Blucher titled, "Taking Nothing For Granted", which was released in 2005.
