The '''Buenos Aires [[central business district]]''' (CBD and also referred to as ''the City Porte<U+00F1>a'', ''Downtown'' and ''Microcentro''), is the main commercial centre of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], though not an official [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|city ward]].
==Overview==

The area was the site of the first [[Pedro de Mendoza|European settlement]] in what later became Buenos Aires. Its south-north axis runs along [[Leandro Alem Avenue]], from [[Belgrano Avenue]] in the south to [[Retiro railway station]] in the north, and its east-west axis runs from the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]] to [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. The district is centered around the [[San Nicol<U+00E1>s, Buenos Aires|San Nicol<U+00E1>s]] ward, and includes the northern section of [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]], the section of [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] south of [[Santa Fe Avenue]], and the section of [[Puerto Madero]] west of the [[Buenos Aires Docklands]]. 

The district is the financial, corporate, and cultural hub of Buenos Aires, and of Argentina. The economy of [[Buenos Aires]] was the 13th largest among the world's cities in 2005 at US$245 billion in [[purchasing power parity]],<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2005.html City Mayors]</ref>  which, based on the population of that year,<ref>[http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/4/EPHcont_3trim05.pdf  INDEC]</ref> translates into US$21,500 per capita. The Buenos Aires [[Human Development Index]] (0.923 in 1998) is likewise high by international standards.<ref>[http://www.desarrollohumano.org.ar/IDHArgentina/98_nac/98_nac.html 'Informe Argentino Sobre Desarrollo Humano']</ref> 
The [[Port of Buenos Aires]] is one of the busiest in South America; navigable rivers by way of the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] connect the port to [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|northeastern Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]]. As a result it serves as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the South American continent. Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past. 

==Geography==
Buenos Aires CBD lies in the [[Pampa|Pampa region]], except some zones like the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]], the [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors (football) Club]] "sports city", [[Jorge Newbery Airport]], the [[Puerto Madero]] neighborhood and the main port itself. These latter were all built on [[reclaimed land]] along the coast of the [[Rio de la Plata]] (the world's largest [[estuary]]).

The region was formerly crossed by different [[Stream|creeks]] and [[lagoon]]s, some of which were refilled and other tubed. Among the most important creeks are: Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cilda<U+00F1>ez and White. In 1908 many creeks were channeled and rectified, as floods  were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most creeks were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and currently runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue (north of this district).

Facing the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] estuary, the frontage remained flood-prone, and in 1846, Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had a contention wall six blocks long built along the existing promenade. An [[English Argentine]] investor, Edward Taylor, opened a pier along the promenade in 1855, and the flood-control walls were extended northwards to [[Recoleta]], and south to [[San Telmo]], in subsequent works completed in 1865.<ref name=bue>[http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&ide=216 Buenos Aires.gov: Paseo de Julio {{es}}]</ref>

A sudden economic and population boom led the new President of Argentina, [[Julio Roca]], to commission the development in 1881 of an ambitious port to supplement the recently-developed facilities at [[La Boca]], in Buenos Aires' southside. Approved by the [[Argentine Congress]] in 1882 and financed by the prominent [[London]]-based [[Barings Bank]] (the chief underwriter of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time), the project required the [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] of over 200 hectares (500 acres) of underwater land and was accompanied by the widening of the promenade into what became Leandro Alem Avenue.<ref name=historia>[http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm Puerto Madero: history]</ref>

==Architecture==
[[File:Buenos Aires D<U+00E9>cembre 2007 - Avenida 5 de Mayo.jpg|thumb|260px|Diagonal Norte Avenue]]

[[Italian culture|Italian]] and [[French culture|French]] influences increased  after the [[Battle of Caseros|overthrow]] of strongman [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in 1852, and particularly upon the advent of the modernizing [[Generation of '80|Generation of 1880]]. [[French architecture]] insipred the area's redevelopment during the beginning of the 20th century, and [[Eclecticist architeture|eclectic designs]] that drew from [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], [[French Academy]], and [[Second Empire architecture]] were reflected by numerous historic buildings in this districts from the era, notably the headquarters for ''[[Buenos Aires House of Culture|La Prensa]]'', [[Buenos Aires City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]], [[Buenos Aires Customs]], [[Argentine Supreme Court|Palace of Justice]], the [[Argentine Congress|National Congress]], the [[Teatro Col<U+00F3>n]], the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the [[Buenos Aires Central Post Office]], and along most of the [[Avenida de Mayo]] and [[Diagonal Norte]] Avenue.
[[File:CatalinasBuenosAires.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Partial view of the Puerto Madero docks and the district's newer section]]

Some of the most prominent conrtibutors to the district's architecture from the era included [[Francesco Tamburini]], [[Vittorio Meano]], [[Julio Dormal]], [[Virginio Colombo]], [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]], [[Mario Palanti]], and [[Francisco Gianotti]]. Later significant additions include those by [[Alejandro Christophersen]], [[Alejandro Bustillo]] (most notably the [[Banco de la Naci<U+00F3>n Argentina|National Bank]]), [[Andr<U+00E9>s Kalnay]], [[Eduardo Le Monnier]], and [[Francisco Salamone]].

The [[Alas Building]], commissioned by [[Juan Per<U+00F3>n]] and built in the early 1950s, was the tallest in Argentina until 1995, and was one of numerous commercial structures built in the [[Rationalist architecture|Rationalist]] style in this area during that time. Since the 1960s, newer, high-technology buildings were designed in the district by Argentine architects [[Clorindo Testa]], Santiago S<U+00E1>nchez El<U+00ED>a, [[C<U+00E9>sar Pelli]], and [[Mario Roberto <U+00C1>lvarez]], by firms such as [[SEPRA Arquitectos]] and [[MSGSSS]], and by [[Uruguay]]an architect [[Rafael Vi<U+00F1>oly]]. Some of the more notable commercial developments completed since then have included the [[Catalinas Norte]] [[office park]], [[Torre Bouchard]], [[Bouchard Plaza]], [[Galicia Financial Group|Galicia Tower]], the [[Repsol-YPF tower|Repsol-YPF Tower]]. 

== Districts ==
=== San Nicol<U+00E1>s===
[[File:Reconquista hacia el norte.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Reconquista Street, in the area's financial center]]
'''San Nicol<U+00E1>s''' is one of the districts that shares most of the city and national government structure with neighboring [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]], and is home of the business district's financial center. It's seldom referred to as ''San Nicol<U+00E1>s'', but usually as '''''El Centro''''' ("City Centre"), and the part east of the [[9 de Julio Avenue]] is called ''Microcentro'' ("Micro-centre").

The growing importance of the area as a financial center was highlighted by the 1854 establishment of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]]. San Nicol<U+00E1>s remains the financial center of Argentina, something underscored by the presence of the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] and the [[Banco de la Nacion Argentina|National Bank]], Argentina's largest. The rapid development of the [[Economic history of Argentina|Argentine economy]] after 1875 made itself evident in San Nicol<U+00E1>s with the reclaiming of riverfront land by businessmen [[Francisco Seeber]] and [[Eduardo Madero]], and the shore hitherto popular among washerwomen became the ''Paseo de Julio'' (today [[Leandro Alem Avenue]]). 

The construction of [[Corrientes Avenue|Corrientes]] and [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]]s in the 1930s further modernized San Nicol<U+00E1>s, which had hitherto been limited in its development by its colonial grid of narrow streets. [[Florida Street]], most of which is in San Nicol<U+00E1>s, is the city's best-known [[pedestrianized street]].<ref name=bnic>[http://www.barriada.com.ar/sannicolas.htm Barriada: San Nicol<U+00E1>s {{es}}]</ref> Its most discernible landmark is the [[Galer<U+00ED>as Pac<U+00ED>fico]] [[shopping arcade]].<ref>[http://www.buenosaires-argentina.com/neighborhoods/microcentro.html Buenos Aires Neighborhoods - Microcentro]</ref>

The district is home to the [[Argentine Supreme Court]], the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], the [[Teatro Col<U+00F3>n|Col<U+00F3>n Opera House]], headquarters of numerous leading Argentine firms, including [[Aerol<U+00ED>neas Argentinas]], the [[Bank of the City of Buenos Aires]], ''[[La Naci<U+00F3>n]]'', [[Bunge y Born]], [[P<U+00E9>rez Companc]], the [[Francisco Macri|Macri Group]], and most of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]] leaders, as well as the local offices of a number of international companies, such as [[BankBoston]], [[BBVA Banco Franc<U+00E9>s|BBVA]], [[Citibank Argentina|Citibank]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[HSBC Bank Argentina|HSBC]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Banco Santander R<U+00ED>o|Santander Bank]], and [[Techint]].<ref name=bnic/>
=== Retiro ===
[[File:Leandro Alem Buenos Aires 37.jpg|thumb|260px|Leandro Alem Avenue]]
Retiro is one of the largest hubs of transportation services in Argentina.  Local and long distance rail service heading to the north originate from [[Estaci<U+00F3>n Retiro]] (Retiro Terminal Station), and [[Retiro bus station]] is the city's main long-distance bus terminal. [[Line C (Buenos Aires)|''Subte'' line C]] of the [[Buenos Aires Metro]] system and numerous local public bus services serve Retiro, and this area is always teeming with commuters and traffic on weekdays.

The most important avenue linking Retiro and the CBD to commuters living in residential areas to the north is [[Avenida del Libertador]], which becomes [[Leandro Alem Avenue]] past the Retiro Station. Other important thoroughfares in the Retiro section of the CBD are [[Avenida C<U+00F3>rdoba|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], [[Santa Fe Avenue|Santa Fe]], and [[9 de Julio Avenue]]s. 

The high-rise business district of ''[[Catalinas Norte]]'', as well as the northern end of the Puerto Madero development, is located east of Leandro N. Alem Avenue. Opposite the Retiro train terminal, at the northern end of the CBD, is the leafy [[Plaza San Mart<U+00ED>n (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart<U+00ED>n]], surrounded by great palaces and hotels. The Retiro lowlands were once the training grounds for [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n|Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n's]] ''[[Granaderos a caballo|Granaderos]]'' corps,  and the modern-day Plaza San Mart<U+00ED>n features an [[equestrian statue]] honoring the hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], as well as a memorial for the dead in the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Facing the station is Argentine Air Force Square, where the ''[[Torre Monumental]]'' (formerly ''Torre de los Ingleses''), a monument donated by the [[Anglo-Argentine]] community for the 1910 centennial celebrations, is located.<ref name=bret>[http://www.barriada.com.ar/retiro.htm Barriada: Retiro {{es}}]</ref> 

Other significant landmarks opposite the Plaza are the [[Kavanagh Building]], a [[reinforced concrete]] structure that when completed in 1936, was the tallest building in Latin America at {{convert|120|m|ft|0}}. The nearby [[Brunetta Building]] (formerly headquarters for [[Olivetti]]'s Latin American operations) was the first in Argentina to be built in the [[International style (architecture)|International style]].<ref name=bret/>

=== Montserrat ===
'''Montserrat''' is located south of San Nicol<U+00E1>s. The section of the Montserrat ward within the business district includes some of the most important buildings in [[Argentine Government]] and [[Argentine history|history]], and was the site of the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], the colonial town hall.
[[File:Buenos Aires Subte station plaza once.JPG|left|thumb|260px|City Hall and the Avenida de Mayo]]
[[Avenida de Mayo]] runs through the Montserrat district, connecting [[Plaza de Mayo]] and [[Congressional Plaza]]. A block or two south of the Plaza de Mayo, the older section of Montserrat begins. This was the location of the [[Illuminated Block]], a [[Jesuit]] center of higher learning during the 18th century, and today home to the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]]. This is Buenos Aires' oldest neighborhood and even today, very little of the cityscape there is less than a hundred years old (except along Belgrano Avenue), thereby making a nearly seamless transition to the likewise historic [[San Telmo]] district to the south.<ref name=bmon>[http://www.barriada.com.ar/montserrat.htm Barriada: Montserrat {{es}}]</ref>

The district's led central location and its presence therein of much of Argentina's governmental structure led to monumental construction over the 1910s, notable among which are the [[Casa Rosada]], [[Buenos Aires City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]], the [[Buenos Aires Customs|Customs building]], the offices of ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' (today the [[Buenos Aires House of Culture]]), the art-deco [[NH City Hotel]] (off the Plaza de Mayo), the [[Libertador Building]] (Ministry of Defense), and South Diagonal Avenue. Montserrat's western half was partitioned from the rest by the southward expansion of the massive [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]] around 1950.

The area became a largely bohemian quarter popular with [[Argentine tango|tango]] performers and artists, as well as many who preferred the area's close proximity to the growing [[San Nicol<U+00E1>s, Buenos Aires|financial district]] to the north and its relatively low rent scale. Its rich architectural history and quiet, narrow streets have, as in neighboring [[San Telmo]], helped lead to renewed [[Tourism in Argentina|tourist]] interest in Montserrat since around 1990.<ref name=bmon/>

=== Puerto Madero===
[[File:Buenos Aires - Puerto Madero 142.jpg|thumb|260px|Puerto Madero]]
'''Puerto Madero''', occupies a significant portion of the [[Maritime dock|docklands]] and as the newest of Buenos Aires' 48 boroughs, features the latest architectural trends in Argentina.

Originally developed by local businessman [[Eduardo Madero]] and designed by British engineer Sir [[John Hawkshaw]], Puerto Madero was inaugurated in 1897. Its four docks were relegated to ancillary port functions after the 1926 completion of the New Port to the north, however, and became derelict. Beginning around 1994, however, local and foreign investment led to a massive revitalization effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side warehouses into upscale offices, [[lofts]], restaurants, private universities and luxurious hotels. State-of-the-art multiplex cinemas, theatres, cultural centres, luxurious hotels and office and corporate buildings are located mostly in the eastern side of the district.<ref name=bpm>[http://www.barriada.com.ar/pmadero.htm Barriada: Puero Madero {{es}}]</ref>

Puerto Madero has been redeveloped with international flair, drawing interest from renown architects such as [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[C<U+00E9>sar Pelli]] and [[Phillippe Starck]], among others. Today one of the trendiest boroughs in Buenos Aires, it has become the preferred address for growing numbers of young professionals and retirees, alike. Increasing property prices have also generated interest in the area as a destination for foreign buyers, particularly those in the market for premium investment properties.

The neighborhood's road network has been entirely rebuilt, especially in the east side. The layout of the east side consists currently of three wide boulevards running east-west crossed by the east side's main street, Juana Manso Avenue. The layout is completed with some other avenues and minor streets, running both east-west and north-south, and by several pedestrianised streets. All the streets of Puerto Madero are named after [[Women in Argentina|women]]. The [[Puente de la Mujer]] (Women's Bridge), designed in 2001 by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], is the newest link between the east and west docks of Puerto Madero.<ref name=bpm/>

Puerto Madero represents the largest wide-scale urban project in the city of Buenos Aires, currently. Having undergone an impressive revival in merely a decade, it is one of the most successful recent waterfront renewal projects in the world.<ref>Ann Breen and Dick Rigby, ''The New Waterfront: A Worldwide Urban Success Story'' <U+2013> McGraw-Hill Professional</ref>

Numerous new residential high-rises of up to 50 stories have been built facing on the eastern half of Puerto Madero since 2000.  These include [[El Mirador of Puerto Madero towers]], [[Renoir Towers]], [[El Faro towers]], [[Chateau Tower of Puerto Madero]], and the [[Mulieris towers]], among others. Notable non-residential structures include the [[Repsol-YPF tower]], the [[Buenos Aires Hilton]], the [[Faena Hotel+Universe]] (one of a number of refurbished former [[Molinos R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] silos), and the [[Fortabat Art Collection]] museum building. 

Additionally a [[St. Regis Hotels|St. Regis]] [[Starwood Hotels and Resorts|Starwood Hotel]] is being built along Dock 4, where the famous Opera Bay nightclub was formerly located, and is scheduled to open in 2013. An expansive [[Jumeirah (hotel chain)|Jumeirah]] Polo resort will also feature a hotel in Puerto Madero, working jointly with the [[Campo Argentino de Polo]] and other polo fields in and outside Buenos Aires.<ref>[http://www.puertomadero.com/i_index.cfm Puerto Madero: Sitio Oficial {{es}}]</ref>
