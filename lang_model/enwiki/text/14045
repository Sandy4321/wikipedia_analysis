'''Ishtar''' (<sup>[[DINGIR|D]]</sup>''I<U+0160>TAR'' [[Image:B010ellst.png|100x20px|DINGIR]] [[Image:B153ellst.png|100x20px|INANNA]] {{unicode|<U+0001202D><U+0001230B><U+0001206F>}}) is the [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate northwest [[Semitic]] [[goddess]] [[Astarte]].
[[Anunit]], Astarte, [[Atarsamain]] and [[Esther]] are alternative names for Ishtar. 

==Characteristics==
Ishtar is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war.<ref>Wilkinson, p. 24</ref> In the Bablyonian pantheon, she "was the divine personification of the planet Venus".<ref>Guirand, p. 58</ref>

Ishtar was above all associated with sexuality: her [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] involved sacred prostitution; her holy city Erech was called the "town of the sacred courtesans"; she herself as the "courtesan of the gods"; and she had many lovers.<ref>Guirand, p. 58</ref> However, as Guirand notes,
<blockquote>"woe to him whom Ishtar had honoured! The fickle goddess treated her passing lovers cruelly, and the unhappy wretches usually paid dearly for the favours heaped on them. Animals, enslaved by love, lost their native vigour: they fell into traps laid by men or were domesticated by them. 'Thou has loved the lion, mighty in strength', says the hero Gilgamesh to Ishtar, 'and thou hast dug for him seven and seven pits! Thou hast loved the steed, proud in battle, and destined him for the halter, the goad and the whip.'</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Even for the gods Ishtar's love was fatal. In her youth the goddess had loved Tammuz, god of the harvest, and -- if we are to believe Gilgamesh -- this love caused the death of Tammuz."<ref>Guirand, p. 58</ref></blockquote>

Ishtar was the daughter of Sin or Anu.<ref>Guirand, p. 58</ref> She was particularly worshiped at Nineveh and Arbela (Erbil).<ref>Guirand, p. 58</ref>

==Descent into the underworld==
One of the most famous myths<ref>Jastrow</ref> about Ishtar describes her descent to the underworld. The myth states that Ishtar approached the gates of the underworld and demanded that the gatekeeper open them. If he did not let her in, she said, she would break down the gates, so that the dead would escape and devour the living. The gatekeeper hurried to tell Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld. Ereshkigal told the gatekeeper to let Ishtar enter, but "according to the ancient decree".

The gatekeeper let Ishtar into the underworld, opening one gate at a time. At each gate, Ishtar had to shed one article of clothing. When she had finally passed the seventh gate, she was naked. In rage, Ishtar threw herself at Ereshkigal, but Ereshkigal ordered her servant Namtar to imprison Ishtar and unleash sixty diseases against her.

After Ishtar had descended to the underworld, all sexual activity ceased on earth. The god Papsukal reported the situation to Ea, the king of the gods. Ea created a eunuch called Asu-shu-namir and sent him to Ereshkigal, telling him to invoke "the name of the great gods" against her and to ask for the bag containing the waters of life. Ereshkigal was enraged when she heard Asu-shu-namir's demand, but she had to give him the water of life. Asu-shu-namir sprinkled Ishtar with this water, reviving her. Then Ishtar passed back through the seven gates, getting one article of clothing back at each gate, and was fully clothed as she exited the last gate.

Here there is a break in the text of the myth. The text resumes with the following lines:
<blockquote>"If she (Ishtar) will not grant thee her release,
To Tammuz, the lover of her youth,
Pour out pure waters, pour out fine oil;
With a festival garment deck him that he may play on the flute of lapis lazuli,
That the votaries may cheer his liver. [his spirit]
Belili [sister of Tammuz] had gathered the treasure,
With precious stones filled her bosom.
When Belili heard the lament of her brother, she dropped her treasure,
She scattered the precious stones before her,
"Oh, my only brother, do not let me perish!
On the day when Tammuz plays for me on the flute of lapis lazuli, playing it for me with the porphyry ring.
Together with him, play ye for me, ye weepers and lamenting women!
That the dead may rise up and inhale the incense."</blockquote>
Formerly, scholars<ref>Guirand, p. 58</ref><ref>Mackenzie, p. 95-98</ref> believed that the myth of Ishtar's descent took place after the death of Ishtar's lover, Tammuz: they thought Ishtar had gone to the underworld to rescue Tammuz. However, the discovery of a corresponding myth<ref>Wolkstein and Kramer, p. 52-89</ref> about Inanna, the Sumerian counterpart of Ishtar, has thrown some light on the myth of Ishtar's descent, including its somewhat enigmatic ending lines. According to the Inanna myth, Inanna could only return from the underworld if she sent someone back in her place. Demons went with her to make sure she sent someone back. However, each time Inanna ran into someone, she found him to be a friend and let him go free. When she finally reached her home, she found her husband Dumuzi (Babylonian Tammuz) seated on his throne, not mourning her at all. In anger, Inanna had the demons take Dumuzi back to the underworld as her replacement. Dumuzi's sister Geshtinanna was grief-stricken and volunteered to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time Dumuzi could go free. The Ishtar myth presumably has a comparable ending, Belili being the Bablyonian equivalent of Geshtinanna.<ref>Kirk, p. 109</ref>

==Comparisons with other deities==
Like Ishtar, the Greek [[Aphrodite]] and Northwestern Semitic [[Astarte]] were love goddesses who were "as cruel as they were wayward".<ref>Mackenzie, p. 103</ref> Mackenzie draws a parallel between the love goddess Aphrodite and her "[[life-death-rebirth deity|dying god]]" lover [[Adonis]]<ref>Mackenzie, p. 83</ref> on one hand, and the love goddess Isthar and her "dying god" lover Tammuz on the other.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 103</ref> Some scholars have suggested that
<blockquote>"the myth of Adonis was derived in post-Homeric times by the Greeks indirectly from Babylonia through the Western Semites, the Semitic title 'Adon', meaning 'lord', having been mistaken for a proper name. This theory, however, cannot be accepted without qualifications."<ref>Mackenzie, p. 84</ref></blockquote>
Joseph Campbell equates Ishtar, Inanna, and Aphrodite, and he draws a parallel between the violent yet loving [[Hindu]] goddess [[Kali]], the Egyptian goddess Isis who nurses Horus, and the Babylonian goddess Ishtar who nurses the god Tammuz.<ref>Campbell, p. 70</ref>
