{{otheruses|Buckeye}}
The '''Buckeye''' is a [[breed]] of [[chicken]] originating in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. Created in the late 19th century, Buckeyes are the only breed of American chicken known to have been created by a woman, and the only one to have a small "pea" [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]]. As of 2008, Buckeyes are extremely rare, and breed conservation organizations have recognized them as critically endangered. The breed's name is derived from Ohio's nickname of "Buckeye state", and their color is said ideally to resemble the seeds of the [[Aesculus glabra|Ohio Buckeye]] plant (''Aesculus glabra''). They are largely utilitarian birds: lacking fanciful colors, instead they have a decent laying ability and strong meat production characteristics. Buckeyes are white skinned chickens who lay brown eggs.

==History==
{{seealso|Selective breeding}}
The Buckeye was first bred and developed in 1896, by a [[Warren, Ohio]] resident named Nettie Metcalf.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heinrichs|2007| p =56}}</ref> They are the only American breed of chicken known to have been developed by a woman, despite the fact that women were customarily given charge of the household [[poultry]] flock throughout much of U.S. history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ekarius|2007| p =79}}</ref> Metcalf crossbred [[Barred Plymouth Rock]]s, [[Cochin (chicken)|Buff Cochins]], [[Rhode Island Red]]s, and some black&ndash;breasted red [[Gamecock|games]] to produce the Buckeye. Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ekarius|2007| pp =79<U+2013>80}}</ref> 

The Buckeye was admitted to the [[American Poultry Association]]'s [[Standard of Perfection]] in 1904.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ekarius|2007| pp =80}}</ref> Entrance in to the Standard of Perfection signifies official certification as a breed by the Association, and thus allows Buckeyes to be entered in to [[Livestock show|poultry shows]] and judged according to the [[breed standard]] (as outlined in the Standard of Perfection). The recognition of Buckeyes in the Standard has been a significant factor in its survival.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heinrichs|2007| p =56}}</ref> However, largely due its lack of color variations, the Buckeye has never been an especially popular exhibition breed. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today, it is listed as critically endangered by the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]],<ref name="ekarius80" >{{Harvnb|Ekarius|2007| p =80}}</ref> as there are estimated to be five or fewer flocks, with no more than 500&nbsp;breeding birds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ekarius|2007| p =19}}</ref> The breed is also included in the [[Slow Food USA]] [[Ark of Taste]], a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.<ref>{{citation |chapter=Buckeye Chicken |title=Ark of Taste |publisher=[[Slow Food USA]] |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/ark/buckeye_chicken.html |accessdate=2008-05-03 |format={{dead link|date=April 2009}} &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AArk+of+Taste&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> }}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Aesculus glabra seeds.jpg|thumb|The seeds of the Ohio Buckeye, which represent the ideal color for a Buckeye chicken]]
The Buckeye male weighs an average of 9&nbsp;lbs (4.1&nbsp;kg), and the hen 6.5&nbsp;lbs (3&nbsp;kg). The breed has [[yellow]] skin and lays brown eggs. Its primary color is a [[mahogany]] red with black tails; sometimes males have other dark feathering. According to the breed standard, a Buckeye's plumage should ideally resemble the hue of an Ohio Buckeye's seeds. Especially in the hen, the breed is very similar in appearance to the Rhode Island Red, although can be differentiated by a bar of slate color on the back feathers close to the body; the body is also much more compact, with a short, yet broad, back.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heinrichs|2007| p =57}}</ref>

The Buckeye is the only purely American breed to sport a pea [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], and this, combined with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken.<ref name="ekarius80" /> Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the [[Ameraucana]]) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character and a very good forager. Generally calm, the cock may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, and is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of a fair number of eggs, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken well&ndash;suited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heinrichs|2007| pp =56<U+2013>57}}</ref>
