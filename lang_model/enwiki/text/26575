==Construction==
The house was built in 1879 by William Palmer Southworth,<ref>{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Grant |title=19-century mansion revived as union hall for Laborers Local 860 |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2007/12/_the_hardhatted_laborers_on.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|The Plain Dealer]] |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> a Cleveland businessman who established W.P.

==After Southworth==
In August 1906, a group of Cleveland [[Baptist]]s incorporated an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a [[retirement home]] for elderly Baptists.  Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller]], who was a Baptist.  With the aid of local churches, the home was opened on October 16, 1907.<ref name=judson>[http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=JRC "Judson Retirement Community"], ''Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'', [[Case Western Reserve University]], 2006-08-29.

During the 1950s and 1960s, various businesses had offices in the house, which was then called the "Edelmar Building" or the "Accountants Building."  In 1973, the Southworth House was purchased by Pi Sigma Tau Alpha, a [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] based at the nearby [[Cleveland State University]]; it later served as the [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|fraternity house]] for Cleveland State's chapter of [[Delta Sigma Phi]].

==Preservation==
The Southworth House is recognized as a landmark both nationally and locally.  Along with many other properties along Prospect Avenue, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 1, 1984 as part of the "Upper Prospect Multiple Resource Area."<ref>Sites listed at [http://ech.cwru.edu/Resource/text/CLS.html Cleveland Landmark Structures] (from [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'', accessed 2008-12-26) with their entries at the {{cite web|url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/|title=National Register Information System|date=2008-04-15|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>  It was included both for its distinctive combination of [[Neoclassical architecture|Classical Revival]] and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] architecture and for its association with Southworth.<ref name=ohiohistory />  As the "Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity House," it has been designated a Cleveland Landmark by the city of Cleveland.<ref>[http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/around_town/city_highlights/landmarks/designatedlandmarks.html Properties Designated as Cleveland Landmarks Through 1998], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]].
