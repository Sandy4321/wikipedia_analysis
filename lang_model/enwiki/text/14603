'''Operation Chengiz Khan''' was the code name assigned to the [[pre-emptive strike]]s carried out by the [[Pakistani Air Force]] (PAF) on the forward airbases and [[radar]] installations of the [[Indian Air Force]] (IAF) on the evening of 3 December 1971, and marked the formal initiation of hostilities of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Mounted in three waves between 17:39 and 23:00 hrs, the strikes were targeted against the Indian airbases of [[Amritsar]], [[Ambala]], [[Agra]], [[Awantipur]], [[Bikaner]], [[Halwara]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Jaisalmer]], [[Pathankot]], [[Bhuj]], [[Srinagar]] and [[Uttarlai]] as well as against air defence radars at Amritsar and [[Faridkot, India|Faridkot]].<ref name= acig>{{cite web

==Background==
{{main|Bangladesh Liberation War}}

In March 1971, [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) [[Bangladesh declaration of independence|declared independence]] from [[Pakistan]], starting the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] following rising political discontent and [[cultural nationalism]] in East Pakistan and the brutal suppressive force from West Pakistan in response (see [[Operation Searchlight]] and [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]]).<ref name= genwatch>{{cite web

Pakistan came under increasing criticism<ref name= Donaldson>{{Harvnb|Donaldson|1972|p=}}</ref> from [[India]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Japan]], and [[List of countries in Europe|Europe]] as the plight of the refugees and their impact on the Indian economy were highlighted by [[Indira Gandhi]] in the UN and on a number of global tours.<ref name=Times13/> However, the [[United States]] and [[China]] showed little interest in the situation and actively opposed aid, intervention or support to the [[Mukti Bahini]]<ref name= Banglapedia>{{cite web

India's aid to the Mukti Bahini continued unabated, and fighting between the Mukti Bahini and the Pakistani forces grew increasingly vicious. On 9 August 1971, India signed a [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|twenty-year co-operation treaty]] with the Soviet Union<ref name= Kapur>{{Harvnb|Kapur|1972|p=}}</ref> which promised military support to either nation should she be attacked. This provided India cover against any possible Chinese or American intervention in aid of Pakistan if it went to war with India. To the Pakistani leadership, it became clear that armed Indian intervention and secession of East Pakistan was becoming inevitable.<ref name=TIME20/>

==The strategy of pre-emption==
By October 1971, the Mukti Bahini had started launching massive raids deep into East Pakistan with active support of the Indian Army troops.<ref name= BanglapediaMuktiBahini>{{cite web

This policy made the assumptions that an open conflict with India would not last long due to international pressure, and since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. To this end, Gen. [[Tikka Khan]] had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive.<ref name=IDS>{{cite web

}}</ref> The initial plans for the offensive called for at least a temporary cover of [[air dominance]] by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into [[Western India]] before digging in and consolidating their positions. In order to achieve air dominance, Pakistan decided to launch an [[offensive counter air]] strike codenamed ''Operation Chengiz Khan'' on Indian airbases.

A second objective for the PAF was to conduct [[air interdiction]] against the supply routes for the Indian troops opposing Khan's proposed offensive, but these were accorded as secondary targets to be engaged after the operation started.<ref name=IDS/>

==Operation Chengiz Khan==
The PAF's strikes were based on the same strategy of pre-emptive neutralization of enemy air capability used by the [[Israeli Air Force]] against [[Egypt]]ian and Arab air forces in [[Operation Focus]] during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967.<ref name=acig/><ref name= iaf>{{cite web

The decision to hit India with a pre-emptive air strike was taken on 30 November 1971 during a meeting among the Pakistani President, Gen. [[Yahya Khan]], Chief of Staff Gen. [[Abdul Hamid Khan (general)|Abdul Hamid Khan]], and the Chief of General Staff, Lt. Gen. [[Gul Hassan Khan]].

The objectives of the strike were:

*''To surprise'' the IAF by attacking its [[forward airfield]]s when it was least expected.
*''To neutralize'' these in order to obtain at least temporary battlefield [[air superiority]] in the West.
*''To counter-balance'' the Indian numerical advantage by hitting the [[forward operating base]]s of the Indian Air Force as a measure reducing the weight of expected counterattacks on PAF's own bases.

To achieve surprise, the decision was made to strike on a Friday, the day of the [[jumu'ah]] ([[Muslim]] [[sabbath]]), at 17:45 hrs when shifts in IAF control centers were changing. Emulating its operations' experience in battle against the Indian Air Force during the [[Indo-Pakistani Conflict of 1965]], the decision was made to hit the Indian bases in a two-wave [[dusk]] strike followed by a number of night-[[interdiction]] missions through the night.<ref name= acig/> The plans for the strike also anticipated the Indians securing their aircraft in [[blast pen]]s.<ref name= IDS/> Also, anticipating difficulty in target acquisition for camouflaged targets such as fuel tanks, ammunition dumps and command centers, the primary objectives set for the operation were the runways and air defense radars.<ref name=IDS/>

==The first strikes==
The final orders for the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs. The first formations were in air and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on [[Pakistan Rangers]]' outposts by regular troops of the [[Indian army]], which the Indian Air Force was providing support to.<ref name=Times13/> The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front.<ref name= Times13/> However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was the roar of the strike aircraft over their airfields,<ref name= acig/> while in [[Delhi]], the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, that something was going on.<ref name= Times13/>

The first two waves deployed 32 aircraft. Of these, 24 were [[Canadair F-86 Sabre|F-86F]] Sabres equipped with bombs, 8 [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]]s armed with bombs, and 4 [[F-104]]s armed with cannons.<ref name=Pakdefsite>{{cite web

}}</ref>  The raids were limited to one pass at a relatively high level with the pilots ordered not to operate below 300m AGL as defence against [[ack ack|ground fire]].

*'''Pathankot''' <U+2014> The first of the strikes were mounted against [[Pathankot]] AB. Led by a flight of two [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]]s (a reconnaissance craft and a strike escort) <ref name= acig/> a six ship mission of [[Canadair F-86 Sabre|F-86F]]s  flying from Murid and led by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] S N Jilani hit Pathankot with unguided rockets and dropped several 125&nbsp;kg bombs. The main target of this strike was the runway, which was damaged and took the Indian ground crew several hours to repair.<ref name=Pakdefsite/> These missions went unopposed since the IAF had not scrambled any interception, and faced only [[Ack ack|AA]]. Pathankot was covered by interceptors from Adampur following this first strike during the time it took the ground crew to repair its runway.<ref name=lal><U+201C>My Days with the IAF<U+201D> by Air Chief Marshal P C Lal</ref>

*'''Amritsar''' <U+2014> At 17:45 hrs, four Mirages flying from [[Sargodha]] and led by Wing Commander Hakimullah attacked Amritsar AB.<ref name=Pakdefsite/> Hakimullah's flight was armed with two 500&nbsp;kg bombs each, which the strike used efficiently hitting the first 300m of the runway and cratering it enough to leave it nonoperational for several hours.<ref name="Lal">{{Harvnb|Lal|1986|p=}}</ref> However, the Amritsar runway was repaired within the same night to receive detachments of [[Mig 21]]s and [[Su-7]] that flew against [[PAF Base Rafiqui|Rafiqui AB]] the next morning. A second strike of two [[F-104 Starfighter]]s, led by Wing Commander Amjad H Khan hit the P-35 radar station at Amritsar, rendering it inoperational for nearly an hour. On one remaining serviceable lane of runway, two sukhois took off moments before it got bombed by a passing B-57.<ref name=Pakdefsite/><ref name = lal />

*'''Srinagar''' <U+2014> [[Srinagar]] was hit at 17:50 hrs by a flight of six F-86Fs <ref name=Pakdefsite/> led by Wing Commander Changezi. Flying from [[Peshawar]], the strike hit a fully lit up Srinagar airport with 250&nbsp;kg bombs. However, this strike failed to cause any significant damage. Srinagar was to be attacked a second time, [[Operation Chengiz Khan#Followup counter-air strikes|during the followup strikes]] later in the evening, by a [[C-130]] commanded by [[Group Captain]] Qayyum.<ref name=Pakdefsite/> However Srinagar largely escaped unscathed.

*'''Awantipur''' <U+2014> Awantipur was hit at the same time as Srinagar, at approximately 17:50 hrs by a flight of F-86 Sabres led by Wing Commander Abdul Aziz.<ref name=Pakdefsite/> Awantipur, at this time did not have any IAF aircraft based there. The strike therefore did not achieve any significant results.

*'''Faridkot''' <U+2014> At 17:53 hrs, a two ship mission of F-104As flying from Masroor and led by Wing Commander Arif Iqbal hit the Faridkot radar station with cannon fire. This strike damaged the P-35 radar significantly. One of the pilots found it hard to resist the sight of a [[light aircraft]] parked near the runway and made an extra attack to destroy it.<ref name=Pakdefsite/>

All the Pakistani aircraft deployed in this first wave were recovered safely. However, the orders to make relatively high level passes also compromised the effectiveness of these strikes, with the result that IAF ground personnel were able to complete the repair to whatever damage was caused within the same night, hindered only by the follow-up waves.

Within forty-five minutes of these strikes, Pakistani troops had shelled India's western frontier and were reported to have crossed the border at Punch in the state of Jammu.<ref name=Times13/>

==Followup counter-air strikes==
The third wave of the PAF counter air strikes were directed to strike [[Ambala]], [[Agra]] and [[Halwara]] around 18:00 hrs and continued in single or two ship formations through the evening until at least 22:30 hrs. These strikes involved fifteen [[B-57 Canberra]]s, four [[T-33 Shooting Star|T-33]]s, and one [[C-130]]. The B-57s flew seven single ship sorties. These caused significant damage, especially in [[Operation Chengiz Khan#Uttarlai|in Uttarlai]] [[Operation Chengiz Khan#Halwara|and Halwara]] and impeded IAF's preparation [[Operation Chengiz Khan#The Indian retaliation|for retaliation]].

*'''Ambala''' <U+2014> Ambala was a hit by a two ship B-57 formation led by Wg. Cdr. Rais Rafi. The flight hit the runway with eight bombs, causing minor damage.

*'''Agra''' <U+2014> Like Ambala, Agra, which lay deepest among the PAF's targets that evening, was struck by a two ship mission of B-57 led by Wg. Cdr. Yunus and suffered minor damage. Ironically, the first Indian Counter strikes launched that very night included the [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]]s of No.5 Sqn<ref name=globsec5/> were based at Agra.

*'''Halwara''' <U+2014> Halwara was struck twice on the night of the 3rd. The first of these was by a two ship flight of B-57s led by Sqn. Ldr. Abdul Basit. This flight struck the runway with eight bombs, three of which landed on target and significantly damaged it. Halwara was attacked a second time by a single B-57 bomber just before midnight. The arrival of the aircraft was detected by radar and the anti aircraft defences were ready. The aircraft dropped some bombs on the runway and airfield. One of the bombs dropped by the aircraft was equipped with a delayed fuse. It exploded while being examined and killed a navigator from the missile squadron. Halwara was not repaired before early the next morning.<ref name=Pakdefsite />

*'''Amritsar and Bikaner''' <U+2014> [[Amritsar]] was attacked a second time at around 22:10 hrs by the flight of Flt. [[Bikaner]] was attacked by Sqn. Ldr. Haq while Pathankot was struck by Flt. Lt. Sultan Arshad. Neither of these caused any significant damage.

*'''Sirsa''' <U+2014> Sirsa was hit by Sqn. Ldr. Alvi with bombs equipped with time-delayed fuses, damaging the runway heavily and forcing the runway to be closed for the rest of the night.<ref name="Lal"/>

*'''Bhuj''' <U+2014> Was accurately bombed and IAF commanding officer found it difficult to get enough labour to repair it.<ref name=Pakdefsite />

*'''Uttarlai''' <U+2014> Four [[T-33 Shooting Star|T-33s]] from A-Flight No.2 Squadron, led by Sqn. Ldr. Qureshi, hit Uttarlai, causing damage to the runway. These were launched at the same time as the [[Operation Chengiz Khan#Srinagar|second strike over Srinagar]]. Uttarlai was attacked a second time later that night by Wg. Cdr. Akhtar. The net damage to the runway was significant enough to keep the runway closed for six days and for the taxiway to be used instead.<ref name = lal /><ref name=Pakdefsite />
*'''Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Jamnagar''' <U+2014> In the south, Sqn. Ldr. Ishtak Qureshi's bombs hit the underground power cable at [[Jaisalmer]], cutting off the power supply and telephone connection for six hours. At the same time, [[Jodhpur]] was hit by two B-57s led by Sqn. Ldr. Sohail Mansur while Jamnagar was hit by Flt. Lt. Ejaz Azam.<ref name = lal /><ref name=Pakdefsite />

The later flights were not expected to achieve any significant objectives which they miraculously did, and also aided to hamper any counter-air strike by the IAF.<ref name= acig/> The pilots were all qualified for night flying and were to continue flying such raids for the rest of the war, gaining the nickname ''"Uttarlai Night Mail"''.

==The Indian retaliation==
{{seealso|East Pakistan Air Operations}}

As Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] addressed the nation on radio shortly after midnight<ref name= BBC/> informing about the Pakistani attack, the [[Indian Air Force]] struck back. By 21:00hrs, the [[B-57 Canberra|Canberra]]s of the [[No. 35 sqn|No.35 Squadron]] and No.106 Squadron, as well as No.5 and No.16 squadron were armed and ready for their foray deep into Pakistan. These flew against eight Western Pakistani airfields of Murid, Mianwali, Sargodha, Chander, Risalewala, Rafiqui, and Masroor. In total, 23 combat [[sortie]]s were launched that night, inflicting heavy damage to Sargodha and Masroor.<ref name=acig/> The PAF units stationed on these airfields had to operate from taxiways for the following two days.

Through the night the IAF also [[East Pakistan Air Operations#3<U+2013>4 December|struck the main East Pakistani airfields]] of [[Tejgaon]], and later Kurmitolla. At the same time, the IAF was deploying additional aircraft to its forward airfields for the strikes that were to follow the next morning. Within two days, the Indian Air Force was to achieve [[East Pakistan Air Operations, 1971|complete air supremacy in the East Pakistan]].<ref name= TIME20>{{cite news

}}</ref>

On the other hand IAF Canberras which raided PAF's airfields were "bombed up" by PAF fighters ready in anticipation of the counter attack.<ref name=IDS /> <ref name=Pakdefsite />

==Analysis==

In total, the Pakistani Air Force dropped 183 bombs over 12 target runways and 120 hits were reported by the pilots.<ref name=acig/><ref name=Pakdefsite/> However, of its stated objectives, the PAF was unable to neutralize the Indian Air Force in the west although it certainly achieved surprise.<ref name= Times13/> The Indian Air Force was unable to offer any resistance to the first waves other than ground fire.<ref name=Pakdefsite/> The damage to the facilities, albeit limited, also meant that the third wave went unchallenged in the air.

Just as importantly, only a limited section of the PAF's strike capability was employed during Operation Chengiz Khan. Also, compared to the [[Israeli Air Force|Israeli Air Force's]] preparation for airstrikes against [[Egyptian Air Force|Egyptian]]s (the Israeli pilots had flown against replicas of the most important Arab airfields) and the use of [[BLU-107 Durandal|specific armament]]s, the PAF had been limited by servicability before the USA supplied spare parts in March of the year and training was limited if any.<ref name=acig/> Constraints of the fledgling Pakistani economy also meant the development of its military could not be supported. The Pakistani Air Force thus lacked ammunition for effective runway denial.<ref name=acig/> [[East Pakistan]]i personnel of the PAF who defected may have revealed some of the plans, and it appears that IAF was expecting a pre-emptive strike against its forward airfields.<ref name=acig/> A large-scale offensive was therefore doomed to fail, likely to cause heavy losses and bring the PAF in a position where it could never seriously challenge IAF operations.<ref name=Times13/>

Yet to prove the positive results of PAF's attack, the following narration comes from an Indian Mig-21 pilot taken prisoner after being shot down over Pakistan. Flight Lieutenant Harish Sinhji, who belonged to a Sirsa-based squadron, stated:<ref>Story of Pakistan Air Force <U+2013> A Saga of Courage and Honour, page 451.</ref>

<U+201C>After one of PAF<U+2019>s night bombing strikes on our airfield, we were all grounded for six hours. The runway had been cratered in many places. The following morning our CO, Wing Commander V B Sawardekar, took us all to the runway to show us the Pakistani pilot<U+2019>s bombing accuracy. Pointing to the craters on our runway he said <U+2018>this is the kind of bombing accuracy the IAF pilots should achieve against Pakistani targets.<U+2019><U+2019>
