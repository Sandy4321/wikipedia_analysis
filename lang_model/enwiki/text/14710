'''1125 China''' is a [[main belt asteroid]] orbiting the [[Sun]]. It makes a revolution around the Sun once every 5 years. It was discovered in [[Purple Mountain Observatory]], [[Nanking]], on October 30, 1957.<ref name="a"/> It was named for the [[China|country]] in which it was discovered, however, its name and number were actually taken from another asteroid that was considered a [[lost asteroid]] at the time, but was eventually recovered and given the new designation 3789 Zhongguo. What is now known as the 1125 had a provisional designation was 1957 UN<sub>1</sub>.<ref>{{cite book |last= Schmadel |first= Lutz D. |title= Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher= Springer |year= 2003 |isbn= 3540002383 }}</ref>

==First 1125 China==
While studying in Chicago in 1928, [[Zhang Yuzhe]] discovered an asteroid that was given the provisional designation 1928 UF, and later the number 1125. He named it "China" or "<U+4E2D><U+83EF>" (''Zh<U+014D>nghu<U+00E1>''). However, this asteroid was not observed beyond its initial appearance and a precise orbit could not be calculated. In 1957, the [[Purple Mountain Observatory]] in China discovered a new asteroid, and with Zhang Yuzhe's agreement the new object {{mp|1957 UN|1}} was re-assigned the official designation 1125 China in place of the lost 1928 UF. However, in 1986, the newly discovered object {{mp|1986 QK|1}} was confirmed to be a rediscovery of the original 1928 UF, and this object was named [[3789 Zhongguo]]. [[Zhongguo]] is the Chinese word for China.<ref>{{cite book | last=Schmadel | first=Lutz | authorlink=Lutz D.
