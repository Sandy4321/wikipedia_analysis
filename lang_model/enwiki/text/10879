Ayyavazhi is centered on [[Ayya Vaikundar]]'s life and preaching, and its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts ''[[Akilattirattu Ammanai]]'' and ''[[Arul Nool]]''.

==Etymology==

{{Main|Etymology of Ayyavazhi}}
The exact origin of the name ''Ayyavazhi'' is not known. The various theories on its derivation include:
* '''Ayya's path''' - from the direct synonymous derivation, which takes Ayya as a noun ''(naming word)'' of Vaikundar.<ref> R.Shanmugam's, Narayana Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram, Page:188</ref>
* '''Path of Father''' - from the local spoken-Tamil language ''Ayya'' (father) + ''vazhi'' (path). This meaning, derived from Tamil, is most commonly used as '' 'ayya' '', and means '''dear father'''.<ref>Dr. R.Ponnu's, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India, Ram Publishers, 2000, Page 68, Sub heading: ''"Reverence as Ayya"'' </ref>
* '''The ultimate truth of Master'''<ref> ''Akilathirattu ammanai Arappadanool'', First Stage, page 27, published by ''Vaikundar Seva Sangam'' </ref> - from [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''Ayya'' (Master) + ''vazhi'' (the ultimate truth) is derived from the literary usage of the words.
* '''Way of attaining the sacred feet of God''' - ''Ayya'' as (God) + ''vazhi'' (way to unify)<ref name= "Ayyavazhi belief system" /> 
The [[synonymous]] versions of the phrase are virtually unlimited, because the usage of the word ''' 'Ayya' ''' in Tamil varies widely. It is used to convey the words ''father'', ''guru'', ''the superior'' etc.<ref name= "Winslow Dictionary"> M.Winslow, (1862), ''A Comprehensive Tamil-English Dictionary'', ISBN 81-206-0001-0, American Mission Press, Madras, Pages:195 and 923 respectively </ref> The word ''' 'vazhi' ''' in Tamil can mean ''the way'', ''manner'', ''method'', ''mode'', ''antiquity'', ''religious system'' and so on.<ref name= "Winslow Dictionary" />

==History==
{{main|History of Ayyavazhi}}
Ayyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship Vaikundar ''(historically known as 'Mudisoodum Perumal' and 'Vaikunta Swami')''<ref name="Sociology of Ayyavazhi" /> ([[1809]] C.E - [[1851]] C.E)<ref>[[Vaikundar]] is a Historical as well as mythical figure. The historical Vaikundar ''(often refered to as 'Vaikunta Swami')'' refers to a person who lived between [[1809]] C.E - [[1851]] C.E. The [[Akilam]] myth says that Vaikundar was the God incarnate who incarnates in the body of ' ''[[Sampooranathevan]]'' ' alias '' 'Muthukutty' '' in [[1833]] C.E and lived upto [[1851]] C.E. So as per Akilam, [[Sampooranathevan]] lived  between [[1809]] C.E - [[1833]] C.E. and Vaikundar then incarnates in the body of Mudisoodum Perumal ([[Sampooranathevan]]) and lived between [[1833]] C.E - [[1851]] C.E.</ref> at [[Swamithoppe]], the then ''poovandanthoppe''. The [[Thuvayal thavasu]] (washing [[penance]]), of 1840 is the origin of Ayyavazhi as an alternative religio-cultural phenomena.<ref>G.

By the middle of nineteenth century, Ayyavazhi had come to be recognised as a separate religion, deep rooted in the region of South [[Travancore]] and South [[Tirunelveli]].<ref> G.Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' published by Department of Christian Studies, University of Madras, Chapter 5, page 91: ''"By the middle of nineteenth century, AV (abbreviation of Ayyavazhi) had come to be a recognisable religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in South Tiruvitankur (Travancore) and in the southern parts of Tirunelveli. From the LMS reports, one gathers the information that AV was spreading with certain 'extraordinary' speed."''</ref> The growth in its number of followers had increased significantly from 1840s.<ref name="Sociology of Ayyavazhi" /> Around the closure of the [[1800|19th century]], Swamithope began to be considered as the headquarters of Ayyavazhi.<ref>[[LMS]] [[Report]] for the year [[1872]], page 107.</ref> After the death of Vaikundar, Ayyavazhi was spread on the basis of his teachings. The five [[Seedars]], who were the disciples of Vaikundar, and their descendants traveled to several parts of the country and carried the mission of Ayyavazhi.<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 120 ''"Vaikunda cami seems to have chosen these disciples to be his close associates and to propagate his teachings and ideas to the people"'' </ref> Meanwhile the [[Payyan dynasty]] started administrating the [[Swamithoppe]] [[pathi]],<ref> N.

As a first printed work of Ayyavazhi, Arul Nool was released in 1927 followed by that of Akilam in 1933,<ref> There is another view that [[Akilam]] was first published in [[1939]] and [[Arul Nool]] in 1918.

{{Main|Ayyavazhi scriptures|Ayyavazhi holy sites}}
The holy books of Ayyavazhi are the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] (often called as '' 'Akilam' '')<ref>[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/20287371 www.worldcatlibraries.org], Akilam : vacan<U+0332>a k<U+0101>viyam, ''Publisher: K Patchaimal, C<U+0101>mit<U+014D>ppu, Kumari M<U+0101>va<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>am : s.n., 1971, Page 1''.</ref> and the [[Arul Nool]], and they are the source of [[Ayyavazhi mythology|the religion's mythology]]. The internal evidence states that the ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' was written down by [[Seedars#Sakatevan Seedar|Hari Gopalan Seedar]] in 1841<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 118-119 ''"The author claims that God woke him up during sleep and commissioned him to write it by 'telling' him what to write"'' </ref> by hearing the contents of Akilam told by [[Narayana]] to his consort [[Lakshmi]].<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 119 ''"It is presented as if Vishnu is narrating the whole story to his consort Leksmi"'' </ref>While the original text is damaged, the daughter versions such as ''Swamithope version'', ''Kottangadu version'' as well as the ''Panchalankurichi version''s are the earliest existing palm-leaf versions of Akilam.<ref name = "Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum:Akilam versions"/> Other release versions includes, [[Sentratisai Ventraperumal version|Sentrathisai Ventraperumal]], the [[Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai version|Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai]], the [[Vivekanandan Version|Vivekanandan]] as well as  the highly criticised [[Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam Version|VTV]] <ref name = "Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum:Akilam versions">''N. Vivekanandan's'' (2003), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part-1, Vivekananda Padippakam.</ref> in addition to the earliest and commonly accepted [[Palaramachandran version]].<ref name = "Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum:Akilam versions"/> Akilam contains more than 15000 verses making up seventeen sections. It is written in poetic [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in a [[ballad]] form and is composed with a unique literal-style with two sub-genres, ''Viruttam'' and ''Natai'' throughout.  

The secondary scripture Arul Nool was a composed one which includes various books which are believed to be written by Arulalarkal (one who get possessed by divine power).<ref name="Arul Nool"> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 119-120 </ref> It contains the prayers, [[hymn]]s and instructions for the way of worship in Ayyavazhi, [[rituals]], [[prophesy]] and also many acts <ref name="Arul Nool" /> It also recollects many events found in Akilam especially that are related to the life of Vaikundar.<ref>R.Ponnu, (2002), ''Vaikunda Swamigal Ore Avataram'', Ram Publications, Page 11-12</ref> But there is no definite history for it. All these texts are compiled in [[Tamil language]].<ref name=" Dr.Poulose's book">''Dr. C.

[[Image:Location of Pancha Pathi.png|180px|thumb|right|[[Pancha pathi]] - Location map]]
To the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are seven holy places, called [[Pathi]]s,<ref name="''Nadar Kulatthil Narayanar Avatara"> R.Shanmugam's, ''Nadar Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram'', Nadar Kuladeepam Pathippagam, Page:195</ref> with '[[Pancha pathi|Pancha pathis]]' being the most important.<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 117 ''" Five such patikal are believed to have emerged during the time of Vaikuntacami. "'' </ref> The temple of Swamithope pathi is the headquarters of the Ayyavazhi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsi.org.in/conference/chennai_tourism.asp#temple |title=www.tsi.org.in|accessdate=2007-10-11 |format= Tourism in Chennai|work= Temples:"Swamithoppe - Ayya Vaikundar Pathi, religious head quarters of Ayyavazhi."}}</ref><ref> N. Elango & Vijaya Shanthi Elango 1997 ''Ayya Vaikuntar - The Light of the World'' Chapter 8, Page 41 ''" The first Pathi is Swamithoppu itself. It is the head quarters of Ayyavazhi. "'' </ref>

The five [[Pathi]]s are,

# [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope Pathi]] - The venue of the great [[Tavam of Vaikundar|Tavam]]; the religious head-quarters.
# [[Ambala Pathi]] - Where Vaikundar unified six of the Seven Deities into him.
# [[Mutta Pathi]] - The venue of the Second and Third [[Vinchai]]s.
# [[Thamaraikulam Pathi]] - Where the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] is written down.  
# [[Poo Pathi]] - Where Ayya unified [[Bhuma Devi|Poomadanthai]] (Earth goddess) into himself through symbolic marriage.

[[Vakaippathi]], though not included in the [[Pancha pathi]] by the headquarters was still considered as a Pathi but with lesser importance.<ref> N. Elango & Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world'', Chapter 6, Page 31 (Thuvayal Panthy) </ref><ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 117 ''" However, there is also another list which includes Vakaipati where tuvaiyal tavacu took place "'' </ref> Apart from this there is a disagreement within the followers of Ayyavazhi as to the holiness of some other Pathis such as [[Marunthuvazh Malai|Vaikunda Pathi]] and [[Avatharappathi|Avathara Pathi]]. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include those Pathis.<ref> N. Elango & Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world'', Chapter 8, Page 41 (Panchappathi) </ref>

==Symbolism==

[[Image:Ayyavazhi Sahasrara.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The [[Sahasrara]], symbolised in Ayyavazhi as '' 'Lotus carrying Namam' '']]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi symbolism}}
The symbol of representation of Ayyavazhi is a [[nelumbo|lotus]] carrying a flame-shaped white '[[Namam]]'.<ref name= "Lotus with Namam"> Tha. Krushnanathan's ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', Thinai veliyeetagam, Page 108. </ref> The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled ''[[Sahasrara]]'' (in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''Ladam'') and the Namam represents the ''Aanma Jyothi'' or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]''.<ref name= "Lotus with Namam" /> Both of the Ayyavazhi scriptures<ref>Akilam15:39 "Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya ''Thirunama'' Pottumittu"</ref><ref>Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. (source: N.Vivekanandan's Arul Nool - Moolamum Uraiyum, page 62 </ref> refers to [[Thirunamam]]''('flame shaped symbol' present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol)'', but not the Lotus. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol is in practise from the mid 20th century.<ref> There is no written references to this but there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered older not less than 50 years. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbolism. </ref>

The mythical narration of akilam about the eight [[yuga]]s is often viewed philosophically as eight [[chakra]]s.<ref name="Yugas as Chakras"> A. Arisundara Mani's Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai (Additional) Page XII-XIII " Athara thana vilakka attavanai " . </ref> The first [[Neetiya Yukam]], is [[Bindu]] and the final state, [[Dharma Yukam]] is Sahasrara or absolute bliss. In this series energy of [[consciousness]](Namam) of oneself is raised from Bindu ([[Neetiya Yukam]]) to the final Sahasrara (lotus) to experience the absolute 'bliss'.<ref>A. Arisundara Mani's, (2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam, page 374.</ref> The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is [[Ekam]] or the supreme absolute.<ref name= "Lotus with Namam" /> Ayyavazhi's symbol seems to be derived from Akilam, and the symbol of Ayyavazhi, '' 'Lotus with Thirunamam' '' shows ''"Vaikundar's experience in Sahasrara."''

As per certain [[Hindu]] legends this Sahasrara chakra has'' '1000 petals' ''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm www.kheper.net |title= [[Sahasrara]] [[Chakra]]|accessdate=2007-02-03 |format= |work= }}</ref> But in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]] it was considered as having  '1008' petals. In Ayyavazhi there is no scriptural background to indicate the importance of '1000', but the number '1008' is commonly mentioned. Also the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. Backing these scriptural identities, 1008 petal lotus are followed in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]].<ref name="Yugas as Chakras" /> Since the Sahasrara is symbolised as [[Lotus]], no stem is drawn for the lotus. 

Also a new building architecture has been developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals where the inverted Lotus petals (as in sahasrara) is used as a design over the roof.<ref> See this Image[[:Image:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png]], a Nizhal Thangal constructed in such a way of architecture near Marthandam, [[Tamil Nadu]].</ref> The lotus may also represents the [[Human heart|heart]] and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.<ref>Pulavar. R.Shanmugam's, (2000), ''Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam'', Nadar Kulatheebam Publications, Page 207</ref>
Ayyavazhi has used other symbols including [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ' ''Triple Namam'' '(not used currently), and [[Conch]].

{{Main|Ayyavazhi beliefs}}
Followers of Ayyavazhi believe in [[reincarnation]] and the subsequent Dharma Yukam, which is the eighth and final yukam, in which Vaikundar will rule the world with [[the Santror]].<ref>Thechanathu Thuvaraga pathi's, ''Akilathirattu Akakkorvai'', page 64-65</ref> They condemn the Indian [[caste system]]<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 114 ''" Other verses from ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' like, 'cast away the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to a clear and specific rejection of the inequalities of castes."'' </ref> and reject the use of standard Hindu ''[[murti]]'' in worship. However, a non-anthropomorphic symbol had been introduced to be used as a point of devotional and meditation focus.<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 103 </ref> This symbol, the [[Elunetru]], which is placed in the [[Palliyarai]], a seat of God, rather than God himself. The same is true of the Elunetru's alternative name, ''Asanam'', which means "seat."

The way of worshipping in front of mirror is introduced to reveal this truth.") 8 - 9 - 2007. </ref> suggesting an idea about God similar to [[Advaita]]n theology.

Ayyavazhi beliefs are closely related to those of [[Smartism]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]], especially in the beliefs related to Trimurthi. Hence, Ayyavazhi's followers believe that [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Siva]] are different aspects of the same God.<ref> A.Manibharathi, (1997) ''Akilathirattu Vilakka urai'', Part - 1, 222-223 .</ref> While some claim that the beliefs of Akilattirattu are related to [[Dvaita]] and [[Vishishtadvaita]], Ayyavazhi endorses the concept of [[The Ultimate Oneness|Ultimate Oneness]].<ref> Akilam10:664 (Thiruvasakam - 2) .</ref>

Ayyavazhi's differs from other Hindus in their recognition of a [[Satan]]-like figure [[Kroni]], the primordial personification of evil who manifests in various forms such as [[Ravana]] and [[Duryodhana]] in different ages or [[yuga]]s. God, as Vishnu, becomes incarnate in his [[avatars]], including [[Rama]], [[Krishna]] and eventually Vaikundar, in order to destroy the foremost evil.<ref> Akilam10: (Thiruvasakam - 2) Source text: Akilathirattu Ammanai published by P. Thangaiyah Nadar, Page - 225 .</ref>

[[Kaliyan|Kali]], regarded as the spirit of Kroni in [[Kali Yuga]] is said to be omnipresent in this age and this is one of the reasons why the followers of Ayyavazhi, like other Hindus, believe that the current yuga, Kali Yuga, is decadent. This spirit (regarded as evil) has been destroyed by Vaikundar, who will transform the world to Dharma Yukam, the 'world of righteousness'<ref> ''It is the story of God coming to transform the world into tarmayukam and rule over it'' - Akilam one - 1:108,109 </ref> Charity is Ayyavazhi's primary mission on the social ground and [[Anna Dharmam]] (offerings of food) can be seen in Ayyavazhi centres of worship at least once a month.<ref> G.Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, page 118 "Even now charity on food is one of the primary activities conducted in these centers." </ref>

==Teachings and impact==
[[Image:Evolution of Ekam till Dwapara Yukam.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Evolution of [[Ekam]], the source of whole [[existence]] (till [[Dwapara Yuga]])]]
{{Main|Main teachings of Ayyavazhi}}
While the majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book Akilattirattu Ammanai, other teachings are collated from various books believed to be written by unknown authors whose works feature in the Arul Nool.<ref>N.Vivekanandan(2001), ''Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum'', Vivekananda Publications, Page 8</ref> Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a close relationship with God, rather than one of fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as ''Ayya'', "dear father", and thus to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.<ref>Dr. R.Ponnu(2002), ''Ayya Vaikundar Ore Avatharam'', Ram Publishers, Page 128-129</ref>

Ayyavazhi mystics highly focus on supreme oneness.<ref>''A.Ari Sundara Mani''(2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Page 384</ref> In the midst of all variations the theology always maintains this oneness sharply. The [[Kali (demon)|evil of Kali]] is the one which blocks that ultimate or supreme [[oneness]] prevailing between individual souls and the universe, giving an [[Self (spirituality)|individuality]] and [[Ego (spirituality)|extreme pride]] for them and make them departing from the quality of the oneness and motivating against it.<ref> N.Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, Vivekananda Pathippakam, Page 12</ref> Ekam <U+2014> The 'over-soul' or the supreme soul, is termed as the whole existence with change less nature and ubiquity which is viewed by individual souls as, 'one which undergoes different changes with respect to [[space and time]]' because of the evil force, [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] influencing them.<ref>''A.Ari Sundara Mani''(2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Page 103-121</ref>

All creations are evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness.<ref>N.Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, Vivekananda Pathippakam, Page 97</ref> So all the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, which evolved from it. It also says that each and every individual soul is a reflection or mirror image of the absolute Supreme, Ekam<ref>Tha. Krishnanathan, (2000), ''Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', page 60-61. </ref> which is also the spiritual synonym for the mirror-worship in Ayyavazhi. Human and all other souls are restricted to the limits by the evil Kali. This is the reason why individual souls are not able to attain the supreme bliss and so these souls are considered secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya it gets unified with Ekam. Its individuality is no more and thereby it's Ekam.<ref>N.Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, Vivekananda Pathippakam, Page 14</ref> On the other hand this supreme consciousness is personified as [[Paramatma]] (over-soul) by which, God is taught to be the 'Husband', while all other souls are his consorts<ref name= "Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai" >Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayan Urai, Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumba Pathippakam, Page 534</ref> which is symbolised by [[Thirukkalyana Ekanai]] where Vaikundar marry the individual souls.<ref name= "Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai" /> Also, the philosophy applies a common formula for the [[creationism]] of [[human beings]] and the rest of the universe, so whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.<ref>P.Sundaram Swamigal & K. Ponnumani (2000), ''Ucchippadippu'', Ayyavaikunta Nather Sidhasramam, page 32-33.</ref>

Ayyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the Hindu caste system in its social teachings.<ref> G. Patrick's ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, page 114 ''" Other verse from Akilattirattu like, 'cast away the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of Castes."'' </ref>
From inception, it has also served as an institution for social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was noted for its unusually strong caste system culture.<ref> Cf. Ward & Conner, Geographical and Statistical Memoir, page 133; V.

[[Pathi]]s which are seven in number, obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centres of worship.<ref name ="Worship Centers" /> They are seven in number.<ref name="Dr.Poulose's book" /> Since Ayyavazhi is not an organised religion the Swamithope pathi though considered as religious head-quarters, it officially does not control the rest of the religious centres. All Pathis, except itself are managed by independently formed committees.<ref>N.Elango & Vijaya Shanthi Elango, (1997) ''Ayya Vaikuntar - The Light of the World'', page 41-44</ref> The five Pathis collectively known as [[Pancha pathi]], are considered primary among Pathis. 

[[Nizhal Thangal]]s, compared with Pathis generally, were simple small structures built for the purpose of worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar.

Even now charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centres. </ref> The seven Nizhal Thangals which are mentioned in Arul Nool are considered primary among Thangals.

These centres are considered the abode of Dharma. The Nizhal Thangals formed an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centres provide [[Panividai]] at least once daily.

==Ethics==

[[Image:Flag mast of Swamithoppe.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The flag mast of [[Swamithoppe]] with Ayyavazhi symbol at the top]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi ethics}}
The 'ethics of Ayyavazhi' being integrated with the meta-narrative mythography are found throughout the primary scripture, Akilattirattu Ammanai.<ref name="Ayyavazhi ethics">T.Krushnanathan(2000), ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', Thinai Veliyeettagam, page 112.</ref> Regarding ethics,  Arul Nool as an accumulation and prophecy of the core concepts found in Akilam.<ref>G. Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', University of Madras, Chapter 5, Page 120</ref> In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as "told by God" at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, [[devas]], [[saints]] etc when ever asked by them. 

[[Neetham]] is the primary virtues of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of almighty in all their works, deeds and activities, during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and 'life in ultimate union with nature' form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, [[Vinchai to Vaikundar|Vinchai]] are the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. These were regulations provided by the Father, Narayana to the Son Vaikundar.  Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first ''Vinchai of Tiruchendur'' forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.<ref name="Ayyavazhi ethics" /> 

To an extent, the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi]] are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and 'attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness' in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for [[Devas]] also.<ref name="Dharma for devas" > ''Mani Bharathi's'',(2003), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai(Part - 2)''. </ref> Also it is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then.<ref name="Dharma for devas" /> Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force [[kalimayai]], with the weapon of love, forbearance and peace since Kaliyan as [[maya]], is ruling the minds of people.

Arul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The [[Sivakanta Athikarappatthiram|Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram]] here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially [[circumambulation]]s are told to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.

==Religiosity <U+2013> study circle ==

[[Image:The Green Lotus.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The Holy [[Symbol of Ayyavazhi]] Tradition]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi religious studies}}
It is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Akilam narrates the central themes of the scriptures regarding Ayyavazhi ethics.  Akilam is given to mankind because Kaliyan destroy the vedas and Shastras and at the beginning of Kali Yuga several additions were given to the previous scriptures.<ref>G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, ''The Religious Phenomenon of Ayyavazhi'', Page:120-121. </ref> ''These both view points give the view of Akilam on Hindu Scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.

Many of the deep-thinkable philosophical concepts are merely mentioned with their names in Akilam and the description is left to be found from somewhere so, it is unavoidable to refer Hindu scriptures for undergoing a religious study on [[Ayyavazhi theology]].<ref>P.Sundaram Swamigal & K. Ponnu Mani, ''Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram'' (Biography of Ayya Vaikunta Nathar), Page 20-21</ref> For example the 96 properties of Human body, [[Tatvas]] is just mentioned in Akilam while saying about the qualities and features of Kaliyan.<ref>N.Vivekanandan (2003), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Vivekananda Pathippakam, Page 190-191.</ref> It is essential to understand each one of the 96 tatvas to understand about Kaliyan. But since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there. How ever, to understand Akilam and its Philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the [[Hindu]] ideas and concepts. 

On [[myth]]ical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main [[Hindu mythology|mythology of Hinduism]] including [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], Kantha Purana, [[Vishnu Purana]], etc but with limited details.  It includes only the main events which are directly linked to the main-stream story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate [[Hindu scriptures]] which includes those events in detail, needed to be referred. It provides all these collectively in brief with an over-all story line, which makes it unique. Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted, some are regenerated, while others are rejected by omitting.

Generally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply have quoted and the rest is left to be found from there, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies. But when the idea of a particular notion of Akilam differs very much from Hindu scriptures, it is deeply described.<ref>''Arisundara Mani's'', Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Preface, page(additional):v </ref>

== God ==

[[Image:The Evolution of Ekam.png|180px|thumb|right|The Theological Evolution - [[Ekam]] to [[Vaikundar]]]]
{{main|Ayyavazhi theology}}
The theology of Ayyavazhi differs from other [[monism|monistic]] religions.<ref>V.T. Chellam's Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, Page - 493</ref> It speaks of Ekam, the ultimate Oneness from which all that which exists formed and also an 'oneness' that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matters as an [[absolute]] constant. So in theological terms God is, in the highest sense, one, formless, [[infinite]], genderless, beyond ''Time and space'' etc. Also notably, the term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, '' 'one', 'absolute' ''<ref>M.Winslow (1869), ''A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary'', American Mission Press ([[Madras]]),  ISBN 81-206-0001-0 , Page 185</ref> '' 'the whole which exist' '',<ref>V.T.Ramasupramaniyam (2001), ''Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi'', Thirumagal Nilayam, Page 210 </ref> '' 'the incomparable' '' <ref>''Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi'' (2004), Narmada Pathippagam, Page 173.</ref> which all give some sort of direct monistic definition about god from Ayyavazhi theology.

Narrating through mythology, The '' 'Sivam' ''(mass) and the '' 'Sakthi' ''(force) are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The '' 'Natham' ''(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. Siva, one among the Trimurthi was the supreme power till Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu is transformed to Vaikundar. Also Ekam, the supreme power take a place within Vaikundar and hence for the present age, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshipable and supreme power. But on the other hand this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is said to be created by Vaikundar, who is a personified universal power. Regarding this, Ayyavazhi is more [[monotheism|monotheistic]] rather than a monistic. But no other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana has not gained an equal or greater status than Ekam. Also it is notable that Vaikundar is a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|turine power]] who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.

In Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni was personified as a [[devil]], and was fragmented into six and was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since most of the teachings of Arul Nool is monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni is said as 'Kalimayai' (the evil spirit) it was commonly accepted that the destruction of Maya is symbolised in such a way,<ref>Arisundara Mani's, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, Page -36, "Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance." </ref> which contrast the [[Dualism|dualistic]] view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] definition to Ayyavazhi theology.

== Festivals and rituals ==

{{main|Ayyavazhi festivals|Ayyavazhi rituals}}
There are basically two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]] is celebrated on the 20th day of the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] month ''Masi'' (March - April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival, to be celebrated as per the [[Solar calendar]].<ref>Tha. Krishna Nathan's(2000), ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'' (Tamil), Chapter - 4, page 74.</ref> The mass procession conducted on this day from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithoppe]] is a popular one in this part of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp#3%20(Dinamalar)|title= Dina Malar|accessdate=2007-03-05 |format= Kanyakumari District|work= Ayya Vaikundar Avathara Dina Vizha}}</ref> The [[Thiru Edu-Vasippu]] is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November - December).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ayyavazhi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=30|title= www.ayyavazhi.org|accessdate=2007-11-11 |format= Festivals|work= Thiru Edu Vasippu 
}}</ref> This celebration of textual reciting as a festival itself, is a unique feature to Ayyavazhi. Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope, called as '' 'Nitham Thirunal' ''.<ref>Tha. Krishna Nathan's(2000), ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'' (Tamil), Chapter - 4, page 70.</ref>

In addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.<ref> G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, University of Madras, 2003, Page 19 </ref> Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt break the case based inequalities prevailed in the then society and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the physical as well as spiritual [[cleanliness]] through Thuvayal Thavasu, eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear,<ref name="Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices" >''T.Krishnanathan''(2000), ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', Thinai Veliyeettagam, Page 93-96.</ref> and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.<ref> Akilathirattu Page 252: "the eighteen castes gathered in one place and bathed from the same well."</ref> But they reveal on the other hand, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language.

The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity, and the ritual healing which are the features of  Ayyavazhi worship contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.<ref>G.Patrick(2003), ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', University of Madras, Page 137.</ref> It attempts to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is, the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#A distinct language|alternative phrases]] religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.

== Inclusiveness and exclusivity ==

{{Main|Inclusiveness and exclusivity in Ayyavazhi}}
This formula of [[Inclusivism|inclusiveness]] and [[exclusivity]] as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi is unique, since both the theories and mixed-up in Ayyavazhi. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.
[[Image:Ten Incarnation door.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The door of [[Swamithoppe]] [[Palliyarai]] with the [[Avatars|ten avatars of Vishnu as per hindu texts]] carved on it]]
Ayyavazhi accepts different God-heads of several religions such as the concept of '[[Allah]]' and almost all God-heads in Hinduism.<ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi">Tha. Krishnanathan(2000), ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', Page 61-65.</ref> It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings.<ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /> But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|cruel nature of his boons]], for the first time the supreme divine power, Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar and so all the lesser God-heads and previous scriptures had lost their substances. So after the time of Vaikunda [[avatar]], Vaikundar was said to be the only worshipable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. Also the manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. Akilam says that Vaikundar was the one who incarnates as [[Jesus]] and so it accepts Christ,<ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /> but it did not recognise The [[Bible]]. It says that the Bible was created with the intention of man and not that of God.<ref> "He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention". - Akilam5:571 </ref> Likewise, Akilam accepts that the term 'Allah',<ref name = "Gods in Ayyavazhi" /> but it rejects the religion of [[Islam]] and its ideas. 

Ayyavazhi accepts various [[incarnation]]s in Hinduism, but rejects the Hindu scriptures. Although it accepts Vedas,<ref> Akilam 12:151 - "Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal" </ref> later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as boon thy too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan and hence gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is the only '' 'Book of Perfection' ''. By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only [[Ayyavazhi scriptures|its own]]. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It also pours hatred on the variations among them<ref>Dr. R.Ponnu's, Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', 2000, page 114 -116. </ref>and points it as the foremost ''Kali mayai'' (evil of Kali). The scriptures teaches that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.<ref name= "Ayyavazhi belief system" />

== Mythology ==
[[Image:Ayyavali Vishnu.PNG|160px|thumb|right|[[Narayana]], [[Ayyavazhi Trinity#Spirit|The Father]]]]
{{main|Ayyavazhi mythology}}
The mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history - a past, a present and a future - meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.<ref> G. Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'' Chapter 6, Page 151, "A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history - a past, a present, and a future - constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts." </ref> It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely [[The Santror|Santror]], Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas which are associated also with [[Hindu mythology]]. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.<ref> G. Patrick's, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'' Chapter 6, Page 151, "It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social. " </ref>

It is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas, the evolution of [[Kroni]] through them, shares some events, mythical characters, and concepts with Hinduism, many of whom were engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, [[Kaliyan]] is unique to Ayyavazhi, and not found in Hinduism. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.<ref> Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula -6th&11th Venpaas (a species of verse).</ref>

The book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of [[Kroni]]. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well-known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,<ref> Samuel Zecharia (1826-1906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled ''The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805-1855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, Page-201. </ref> Wearing of Headgear during worship,<ref> Cf. M.S.S. Pandiyan's ''Meanings of 'Colonialism and 'Nationalism'' Page 180. </ref> Thuvayal Thavasu<ref> LMS Report for the year 1838, Page 71 says "About 70 families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the seashore of Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform." </ref> all were noted in history.

::::<small> * Chakras:- The yugas assumed as chakras above, is one of the philosophical views and is not mentioned directly so in Akilam. </small>

Though there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten Avatars of Vishnu, it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations ''(as in the table)''. It was considered secondary to the primary avatars which are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view, is not inconsistent with Hinduism as only [[Narasimha]], Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.

==Santror and dharma yukam ==

[[Image:Borassus shape.jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Borassus|Palmyra]], the tree cursed to provide [[celestial]] [[nectar]] in the form of Palm-juice for [[The Santror|Santror]] until the closure of [[Kaliyuga]].]]
{{Main|The Santror|Dharma Yukam}}
[[The Santror]] are the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.<ref> G.Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, page 151 "Canror (Santror)is a name that stands for a people who are the subject of the religious vision of AV (Ayyavazhi)</ref> There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation.<ref name="Chanar">G.Patrick(2003), Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, page 151-152.</ref> In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early 'Chanars' who were called by the Arabs as "Al Hind", and known in Biblical times as the "People of Five Rivers", and now scattered with more than 250 branches through-out the world.<ref> As noted in the site [http://nadar.kuttyjapan.com/nadar-who-are-they.asp nadar.kuttyjapan.com] Views based on the extracts of early historians including Herodotus.</ref> But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term 'Santror' in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignity<ref> Dr. R.Ponnu(2000), ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Socil Equality in South India'', page 23, line 5. </ref> and supreme knowledge,<ref>A. Arisundara Mani(2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam (Publishers), Chapter 3, Page 92.</ref> giving an inclusive character and universal reach. A quote from Akilam reads, ''"Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly."'' <ref name="Chanar" />

The Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to born in [[Ayotha Amirtha Gangai|Ayodha Amirtha Vanam]] by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by [[Thirumal]], to the Seven virgins through their instrumentality. There is also a view that these seven boys are the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term 'Santror' refers to the whole [[Human race]].<ref>A. Arisundara Mani(2002), Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, ''Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam (Publishers)'', Chapter 3, Page 90.</ref> Their lineage to be started at the end phase of [[Dvapara Yuga|Dvapara Yukam]] and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.

The Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of [[Dharma Yukam]].<ref> G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, Page - 159 says, "AV, having emerged in a context of distress, proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of tarmayukam." </ref> The basis of the belief is that [[Ayya Vaikundar]] had come to establish and rule as the everlasting king<ref> G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, Page - 109 says, "Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the account contained in it is the story of God coming into this kaliyukam to transform it into tarmayukam and to rule over it." </ref> over the Dharma Yukam in the place of [[Kali Yukam]] after sentencing Kroni to hell by the final judgment to him.<ref> G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, Page - 159 says, "The core of the proposal was that Vaikuntacami had come to establish and rule over a tarmayukam in the place of the kaliyukam." </ref> The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of Time and space,<ref> G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, Page - 161 , "Yet another point to be taken note of in the symbolic vision of AV is its conception of time. AV gives a list of seven aeons, and, at the end of it, postulates a tarmayukam that is to exist</ref> though the Akilam gives space for the beliefs over [[karma]] and rebirth. Apart from this, the Dharma Yukam is often related to [[Moksha]] <U+2014> the personal liberation, and to the state of Oneness too.<ref>Ari Sundara Mani,(2002) ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam Publications, Page 657-658</ref><ref>Mani Bharathi, (2003), Akilathirattu Vilakka Urai (Part 2), Thirunama Pukazh Publications, Page 300-301 (</ref>

== Phenomenology==

{{Main|Ayyavazhi phenomenology}}
''[[Akilam]]'' points out its basis as an ideological regeneration of Dharma (the so called Hinduism) in the form of an entirely new ideology.<ref> Akilam8:Thiruvasakam - 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.) </ref> But today most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise most of the Nizhal Thangals were called as ''Narayana Swami Pathi'' similar to Hindu, [[Vaishnavism]]. Most of the followers also worship Kali and folk deities not included the ideas based in Ayyavazhi scripture.<ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities">Vaikundar Seva Sangham's, (An organisation) (2002), ''Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition'', The activities of Nizhal Thangals, Page 2-4.</ref>
[[Image:Prajapathi Adikalar.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Bala Prajapathi Adikalar]], the present [[Pattathu Ayya]] of [[Swamithope pathi]].]]
Some followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the 10 [[avatars]] of Vishnu as [[Kalki]], and some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation though it is not stated in Akilam. Some even reject the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme Universal power.<ref> Arisundara Mani's ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, Page 1, Line 1-2, ''"Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya."'' </ref> The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Ayyavazhi is completely unknown among most of the followers today.<ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities" /> Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides ''panividais'' for other lesser gods too.<ref name= "Nizal Thangal activities" />

The Ayyavazhi's spread among the common people was mainly due to the practice of [[Shamanism]]. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is they wore Thirunamam (the sign on their forehead).<ref name= "Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai">''R.Shunmugam'', (2000), ''Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram'', Nadar Kuladeepam Publications, Page 189-191</ref> The Nizhal Thangals is identified amongst the other temples by the fact that, idols are replaced by mirrors in the [[Palliyarai]] and all the rest are the same as Hinduism, deviating from the original theme of Ayyavazhi.<ref name= "Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai" /> Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.<ref> Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, Page 3, " ...but it is questionable that how many people know that. Every one who came to know newly about Ayya wonders and... " Bala Prajapathi Adikalar writes about Vaikundar. </ref>All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi makes them hard to be [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a  religion|identified as a religion]] and instead taken as [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a  Hindu sect|a Hindu offshoot]].

==Relation with Hinduism==
[[Image:Kailash Tibet.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Kailash]], where the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boons]] were offered to [[Kaliyan]] by [[Siva]]]]
{{main|Ayyavazhi and Hinduism}}
The Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideology is closed tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism differs was, from the advent of Kali yuga. Akilam says that till Kali Yuga the Vedas and all other [[Hindu scriptures]] remain with divinity. Each of the [[Hindu gods|gods]] in Hinduism also remain with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga they and all their virtues collapsed.<ref>G.Patrick(2003), ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', University of Madras, Page 214</ref> One because Kaliyan bought all the Vedas and the powers of all God-heads as boons from Siva, the then supreme of all [[Devas]].<ref>T.Kirushnanathan(2000), ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', Thinai Publications, Page 63.</ref> So all Gods and the scriptures have to obey him. Secondly, Kaliyan performed several additions to the true scriptures for his comforts and so it could not be identified that, which parts of them are genuine. So for this time, all true scriptures had gone awry and the god-heads get bounded to Kaliyan and remain unhelpful. 

On the other hand, there in [[Kailash]], Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, he who had the responsibility to destroy the Kaliyan as per the previous deeds.<ref>T.Krushnanathan(2000), ''Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', Page 106 </ref> So Vishnu refuse to took birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.<ref>N.Vivekanandan's(2003), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, Page 315 </ref> So [[Siva]] and [[Brahma]] surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.<ref>N.Vivekanandan's(2003), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, Page 321 </ref> Till this event, Siva is the supreme power as per Akilam. This is a theological idea similar to [[Saivism]], where Siva is supreme to all. But from now onwards Vishnu was the supreme power. Here the ideology changes similar to that of Vaishnavism. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of [[Kali Yuga]] till the incarnation of Vaikundar from where it changes further.
[[Image:Kumbas is Swamithope.PNG|180px|thumb|right|The '' 'Tri-Kumbas' '' over the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope]] [[Palliyarai]], symbolizing the presence of [[Hindu trinity|Trinity]] within [[Ayya]], revealing his supremacy.]]
During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he had [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|bought as boon]], the power of Devas including Vishnu's and spread all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. So a total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc. took place and Vaikundar was given birth by intaking the power of Ekam, by [[Lekhsmi]] and Vishnu joining together inside the sea.<ref>A. Arisundara Mani(2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', Page 270-271</ref>

And from now onwards all the powers was handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. And also Siva and [[Brahma]] forms a part within Vaikundar along with Vishnu.<ref name="Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar" >A. Arisundara Mani(2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', Page 288-289</ref> This ideology about [[Trimurthi]] (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; One, within Vaikundar and other as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar.<ref name="Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar" /> Since Vaikundar is given birth, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar is supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Narayana pays the role of Father to Vaikundar. But on the other hand Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he coud not do. Vaikundar is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, he is the only worshipable universal Power<ref>A. Arisundara Mani(2002), ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', Page 290-291</ref> and so the scriptures given by him.

Regarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas which are present in Hindu scriptures.<ref name="Akilathirattu parts" >G.Patrick(2003), ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', University of Madras, Page 119</ref> The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities.<ref name="Akilathirattu parts" /> So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that Hindu scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,<ref>N.Vivekanandan's(2003), ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, Page 427</ref> and so the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharma]] was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and so the Hindu ideas was re-formed.

==Social structure==
[[Image:Swamithoppe pathi .jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Swamithoppe]] [[Pathi]], religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi.]]
{{Main|Structure of Ayyavazhi}}
Ayyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangal]]s, were other characterised Ayyavazhi worship. Though the rituals of Ayyavazhi seems as a reform or revolutionary activity highly focusing social-equality deviating from Hinduism, it was also characterised and bound by religious beliefs which give it an alternative spiritual meaning.<ref> G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, ''University of Madras'', The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali, '' "Rituals" '', Page 98. </ref> Both synonyms for the religious practices highlights the singularity of Ayyavazhi on social and religious grounds respectively. Its scriptures covers almost all basic elements and ideas through-out Hinduism. It refers to [[Shastras]], [[Agamas]], [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]].<ref> Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 180. </ref> It too refers to [[Jesus]] and the Islamic concept of '[[Allah]]'.<ref> Akilattirattu Ammanai published by T. Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 280 -281. </ref> But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar,<ref name="All previous gone awry after Vaikundar" /> from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. All these makes it to be identified separate from Hinduism on one hand and on the other, portrait it as a ''Hindu renaissance''. Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too since it reforms the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Kerala]] society and brought many social changes over there in the 19th century.

The religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and as a result it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhi's addressed their system as ''"Path of God"'' with the phrase ''"Ayya Vazhi"''. On one hand they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand as the synopsis of the whole of world's religious knowledge. On one hand they believe, that [[Vaikundar]] had unified all deities of the world and so all the so called deities within him and on the other as, all previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.<ref name="All previous gone awry after Vaikundar"> G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, ''University of Madras'', The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali, '' "Ayya Vali - A New and Singular Religious Phenomenon" '', Page 120. </ref> Apart from this, Ayyavazhi have separate [[Ayyavazhi theology|theology]], [[Ayyavazhi mythology|mythology]], [[Ayyavazhi holy sites|holy places]], [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centres]], and ethics of its own. All these views Ayyavazhi also as a separate religion.
[[Image:Avatara oorvalam.jpg|180px|thumb|right|'' 'The Great Masi Procession' '' from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithope]].]]
Though many of its followers consider it as a separate religion, there is evidence that some of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.<ref>See {{cite web
