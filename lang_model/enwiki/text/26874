He won the 2004 [[European Footballer of the Year]] award, and was named by [[Pel<U+00E9>]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in 2004.He was also named a starting striker on the 2005 [[FIFPro]] World XI team. Early in 2006, the Chelsea striker joined the SOS team, becoming FIFA/SOS Ambassador for Ukraine.He is also the second-highest goal scorer of all-time in European club competitions with 58 goals, behind only [[Gerd M<U+00FC>ller]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6201442.stm Chelsea 2-0 Levski Sofia]</ref> 

==Biography==
Andriy was nine when the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] occurred in April 1986.  His village, not far from [[Chernobyl]], was also affected by the disaster, and his family was one amongst the thousands who had to abandon their homes and relocate to the coast to escape the after effects.<ref name="FIFA">[http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/gala/0,2418,104455,00.html?articleid=104455 Andriy Shevchenko, the lethal weapon], ''[[FIFA]]'', 29 November 2004</ref> At an early age, he was a competitive [[boxing|boxer]] in the LLWI Ukrainian junior league, but due to his size, he was forced to move on to football, where he flourished.

==Club career==
===Dynamo Kyiv===
Later that year, Andriy failed a dribbling test for entrance to a specialist sports school in Kyiv. However, he happened to catch the eye of a [[Dynamo Kyiv]] scout while playing in a youth tournament, and was thus brought to the club.  He was extremely successful in the youth system at the club, honing his skills on the junior teams.  In 1990, Andriy, playing for the Dynamo Kyiv under-14 team in the [[Ian Rush]] Cup in [[Wales]], was top scorer in the tournament, and was awarded a pair of Rush's boots as a prize by the [[Liverpool F.C.]] player himself.<ref name="FIFA"/>

In 1992-93, he was the top scorer for Dynamo-2 with twelve goals, and he made an appearance in the first team list, taking Dynamo to their second successive league victory.  He scored his first international goal in May 1996, in a friendly against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], at [[Samsun]].  Shevchenko won the league again next season with Dynamo, scoring 6 goals in 20 games.  The next two seasons, 1997-98 and 1998-99, were abundantly productive for Shevchenko.  The highlight of his 1997-98 season was his first-half [[hat-trick]] against [[FC Barcelona]] in the [[UEFA Champions League 1997-98|1997-98 Champions League]], helping Dynamo produce a shock 4-0 road win.  His 19 goals in 23 league matches, 6 goals in 10 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches, and another league victory with Dynamo in 1997-98 were followed by 28 goals in all competitions in 1998-99, and the league top-scorer award for his 18 goals there.  Shevchenko's exploits in the Champions League took Dynamo to the semi-final stage of the tournament, before they lost to [[Bayern Munich]] 3-4 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]]. 

Shevchenko won the domestic league title with Dynamo in each of his five seasons with the club. Under the guidance of [[Valeri Lobanovsky]], the Dynamo manager from January 1997 to May 2002 (his third spell in the post), Shevchenko flourished into one of the team's most prominent and skillful players.

{{Expand|section|date=January 2007}}

===A.C. Milan===
In 1999, Shevchenko joined the then five-time European Cup champions [[A.C. Milan]] for <U+00A3>26 million, and instantly became one of their top players. He made his [[Serie A]] debut on [[28 August]] [[1999]] in a 2-2 away draw with [[U.S. Lecce]].  His impressive haul of 24 league goals in 32 matches earned him the Serie A scoring title, becoming the first non-Italian player to accomplish the feat in his debut season.  Over the next two seasons, Shevchenko scored 34 goals in 51 matches then 17 goals in 38 matches in all competitions, but Milan could not win any silverware in either season.

The disappointment of those two seasons was overcome in 2002-03 when Milan won the [[Coppa Italia]], as well as the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], making Shevchenko the first Ukrainian-born player ever to win a Champions League title. Though Shevchenko was not in top offensive form, netting only five times in 24 matches, he scored the winning [[penalty kick]] in the [[Penalty shoot-out|shoot out]] against arch-rivals [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the final, giving the ''Rossoneri'' their sixth title. 2003-04 was another successful season for both Milan and Shevchenko.  He was the Serie A scoring champion for the second time in his career, duplicating his previous effort of 24 goals in 32 matches en route to Milan winning the ''Scudetto'' after a four-year drought.  He also scored the winning goal in the [[UEFA Super Cup]] victory over [[F.C. Porto]], leading to Milan's second trophy of the season. In August 2004, he scored three goals against [[S.S. Lazio]] as Milan won the Italian Super Cup. He capped off the year in dramatic fashion by being named the 2004 [[Ballon D'Or|European Player of the Year]].

In 2004<U+2013>05, Milan finished runner-up to Juventus in the Serie A standings, helped in part by the seventeen goals of Shevchenko, but Milan's domestic success was promptly deflated in the wake of the 2005 Champions League final, in which they lost a 3-0 lead to [[Liverpool F.C.]] during a six-minute span in the second half. The match ended 3<U+2013>3 after extra time. Shevchenko's decisive penalty was blocked by Liverpool goalie [[Jerzy Dudek]] in the shoot-out, which gave the English side the title. 

Shevchenko scored 19 goals in the 22 games that he played in the 2005-06 Serie A campaign to go with nine goals in 12 total matches in the [[UEFA Champions League 2005-06|Champions League]], making history along the way. On [[23 November]] [[2005]], Shevchenko scored all four goals in Milan's 4-0 drubbing of [[Fenerbah<U+00E7>e SK]], becoming only the fifth player to do so in a CL match (his company includes [[Marco van Basten]], [[Simone Inzaghi]], [[Dado Pr<U+0161>o]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]). However, he scored only once in the last four matches of the quarter-final and semi-final stages as Milan eliminated [[Olympique Lyonnais]] thanks to a last-minute comeback, but were then held scoreless in both semi-final legs en route to falling to Barcelona. He ended the season as the CL's fourth-highest scorer with a total of 43 career goals, in addition to ten qualifying-round scores. 

On [[8 February]] [[2006]], he became Milan's second all-time goalscorer, behind legend [[Gunnar Nordahl]], after netting against [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso]].<ref>[http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail_popup.aspx?idNews=24158&progr=14 SHEVA 56 GOALS OFF NORDAHL], ''ACMilan.com'', February 9, 2006</ref>

During the summer of 2004, there were persistent reports that Chelsea owner [[Roman Abramovich]] offered a record sum of <U+00A3>50 million and striker [[Hern<U+00E1>n Crespo]] to A.C. Milan in exchange for Shevchenko.  Milan refused the monetary offer but took Crespo on loan. Abramovich upped his offer to <U+00A3>85 million to AC Milan, in addition to a record weekly wage of <U+00A3>225,000, to transfer him to Chelsea, but he was again refused. Chelsea chief executive [[Peter Kenyon]] was quoted as saying, "I think Shevchenko is the type of player we would like.  At the end of the day to improve what we have got, it has to be a great player and Shevchenko certainly comes into that class."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4770643.stm Mourinho set for Shevchenko fight], ''[[BBC Sport]]'', [[16 May]] [[2006]]</ref>'' 
Meanwhile, Shevchenko repeatedly denied that he wanted to leave, claiming that he wanted to become a Milan legend like [[Franco Baresi]] and [[Paolo Maldini]]. But on [[11 May]] [[2006]], Shevchenko publicly announced that he would be leaving the club after all, to join the premier league holders, which came as a surprise to Milan fans.

On May 14, 2006, during the last Serie A encounter between Milan and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], Shevchenko watched the first half in the stands with Milan supporters, many of whom cried and begged him to stay, but it was to no avail. Two weeks later, he signed for the London giant.<ref>[http://www.chelseafc.com/article.asp?hlid=391444&title=Shevchenko+transfer+completed&nav=news Shevchenko transfer completed], ''ChelseaFC.com'', [[]]May 31, [[2006]]</ref> The fee has not been officially disclosed, but most media outlets put it between <U+00A3>30 million ($58 million US, <U+20AC>45m<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/Kind=2/newsId=426507.html Shevchenko seals Chelsea switch], ''[[UEFA]]'', [[31 May]] [[2006]]</ref>) and <U+00A3>56 million, which would make it the most expensive transfer in English football and one of the top six in the world. Shevchenko joined up with his new team after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. He received the number seven shirt, as Chelsea coach [[Jos<U+00E9> Mourinho]] said that Shevchenko could continue wearing it.<ref>[http://www.chelseafc.com/article.asp?hlid=391801&m=6&y=2006&nav=news&sub=latest+news It's No. 7 for Sheva], ''ChelseaFC.com'', [[June 2]][[, 2006]]</ref>

On August 13, 2006, Shevchenko scored his first goal for Chelsea in the [[Community Shield]] match against Liverpool, but Chelsea lost 2-1. On [[August 23]], he scored his first [[FA Premier League]] goal <U+2014> and his 300th in top-flight and international football <U+2014> in a 2-1 loss to [[Middlesbrough F.C.]] He then suffered a scoring drought that lasted through six Premiership matches until he finally netted his second goal of the season in a 2-1 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on October 21. 

Shevchenko scored his first Champions League goal for Chelsea in a group phase game against [[Levski Sofia]] on December 6th, 2006. On April 10th, 2007, during the Champions League quarter-finals, Shevchenko helped Chelsea overcome [[Valencia]] to reach the semi-finals stage of the competition with a second half goal. This goal brought his tally of goals scored in the UEFA Champions League to 58, making him the second highest goalscorer of all time in European club competitions.

However, after a poor start to his first season at Chelsea, many people questioned whether he was worth such a hefty transfer fee and there was speculation about Shevchenko's return to [[AC Milan]]. In January 2007 ex-Chelsea star [[Tony Cascarino]] suggested that he might end up being the biggest flop in British football <ref>{{cite news|last=Chick|first=Alex|url=http://eurosport.com/football/premiership/2006-2007/sport_sto1031165.shtml|title=Cascarino: Sheva doomed to failure|publisher=Eurosport|date=13-12.2006}}</ref>.

Despite the constant criticism from the media, Shevchenko continued to work hard at Chelsea and has recently begun to show signs of finding his feet in England. Shevchenko scored his sixth and seventh goals for Chelsea against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in the [[Carling Cup]] semi-final and also scored in the 3-0 victory over [[Football League One|League 1]] side [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[FA Cup]]. From then he has continued his good run of form to score crucial goals in Chelsea's Champions League Match against Porto, against Sheffield united in Premier League and last in [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s FA Cup Quarter Final tie against near rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].The goal against Tottenham was a quality finish from the Ukranian when he ran down the right wing and worked the ball from his right to left foot, and drilled it from 30 yards past Robinson. His goal was the sort of strike that earned him the reputation for being one of football's most feared strikers. On 31st March 2007, he was instrumental in Chelsea's crucial 1-0 win over Watford, assisting [[Salomon Kalou|Kalou's]] headed goal with a pin point pass in injury time.

On 10th April 2007, Shevchenko scored the first goal for Chelsea against Valencia in the second leg that greatly helped in sending Chelsea through to the Champions League Semi-Final.  Michael Essien scored Chelsea's second goal to make Chelsea win the second leg match agaisnt Valencia 2-1 (3-2 on aggregate).  Chelsea will play either Liverpool or PSV in their Semi-Final with Liverpool leading PSV 3-0 going into the second leg which will be played on 11 April 2007.

==International career== 
[[Image:Ukr Stamp UEFA 50.jpg|thumb|right|Shevchenko post stamp in celebration of 50 years UEFA]]
Shevchenko has 71 caps and 33 goals for the [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine national team]], whom he represented at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

In March 2000, Dynamo manager Valeri Lobanovsky became the Ukraine coach, with the aim to qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finals. Shevchenko scored 10 goals in the qualifiers, but Ukraine failed to qualify after losing a play-off against [[Germany national football team|Germany]].
In the [[Euro Cup 2008]] qualifiers, Shevchenko has scored two goals.

==Personal life==
The Ukrainian footballer met his wife at an after party, [[model (person)|model]] [[Kristen Pazik]], whom he married in July 2004 in a private ceremony at [[Congressional Country Club]] in Potomac, Maryland. Though Pazik is [[United States|American]], they communicate with each other in Italian, though Shevchenko had previously made public his desire to learn English, which was one reason he cited for his desire to move to Chelsea.  However Shevchenko's move to Chelsea is considered to be mostly in his wife's interests. The couple has two sons, the oldest being Jordan (named after NBA legend [[Michael Jordan]]), born on [[29 October]] [[2004]], an event which Andriy commemorated by scoring against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] the following day (AC Milan won 1-0). 
 
His second son, Christian, was born on [[10 November]] [[2006]]. The next day, after scoring in a 4-0 Chelsea defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], he and several of his teammates gathered and performed the popular "rock-the-baby" goal celebration as a tribute.

==Name==
Shevchenko's name cannot be fully [[transliteration|transliterated]] from its original spelling in the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] into the [[Latin alphabet]].  His first name is spelled '''Andrii''' by ''[[World Soccer Magazine|World Soccer]]'' magazine, and '''Andrei''' by [[Sky Sports]], although '''iy''' is usually the preferred suffix to Ukrainian names in most English publications.  The correct pronunciation is {{IPA|[an.<U+02C8>drij]}}. His last name is pronounced the same in English as it is in Ukranian or Russian.

==Trivia==
{{trivia}}
*Shevchenko became the third Ukrainian player ever to win the [[European Footballer of the Year|Golden Ball]], following [[Oleg Blokhin]] in 1975 and [[Igor Belanov]] in 1986 (''latter two won the award as [[USSR national football team|Soviet internationals]])''.
*He is a close friend of fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]], and once strolled the catwalk wearing a suit for the Italian stylist, and even opened an Armani store with him in Kyiv. He has also appeared in advertisments for [[Giorgio Armani]].
*In April 2006, he appeared on a commercial for [[ESPN]], [[This is SportsCenter|advertising]] ''[[SportsCenter]]''.  He spoke with anchor [[Scott Van Pelt]] about how Americans call European football ''soccer'' and that Europeans should call [[American football]] ''soccer'' in return.
*Shevchenko was once offered to the Croatian (then Yugoslavian) club [[NK Osijek]] while he was a teenager. NK Osijek had tight relations with the former Soviet Union (now Ukraine and Belarus) teams and the players and managers at start of the 90's. [[Aleksandar Metlickiy]] and [[Alexey Shalimo]] played for the team, as many of them came to Osijek on trial spells. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
