{{History of the Philippines}}

The '''history of the Philippines''' is believed to begin with the arrival of the first humans in the [[Philippines]] by [[land bridge]]s at least [[Upper Paleolithic|30,000 years ago]]. The first recorded visit from the [[Western world|West]] is the arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] on [[Homonhon Island]], southeast of [[Samar]] on [[March 16]], [[1521]]. Permanent settlements in the island of [[Cebu]] were established with the expedition of [[Miguel L<U+00F3>pez de Legazpi]] in 1565, and more settlements continued northward with the colonizers reaching the bay of [[Manila]] on the island of [[Luzon]]. In Manila they established a new town and thus began an era of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonization that lasted for more than three centuries.

The [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain began in April of 1896, culminating two years later with a proclamation of independence and the establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], at the end of the [[Spanish-American War]], transferred control of the Philippines to the [[United States]]. U.S. colonial rule of the Philippines began in December 1899, with very limited local rule permitted beginning in 1905. Partial autonomy (commonwealth status) was granted in 1935, preparatory to a planned full independence from the United States in 1946. Preparation for a fully sovereign state was interrupted by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation of the islands during [[World War II]]. 

With a promising [[economy of the Philippines|economy]] in the 1950s and 1960s, the Philippines in the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rise of [[student activism]] and civil unrest against the corrupt dictatorship of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] who declared [[martial law]] in 1972. Because of close ties between United States and President Marcos, the U.S. government continued to support Marcos even though his administration was well-known for massive corruption and extensive human rights abuse. The peaceful and bloodless [[1986 EDSA Revolution]], however, brought about the ousting of Marcos (who fled to [[Hawaii]] on board a U.S. military helicopter, where he was exiled until his death) and a return to [[democracy]] for the country. The period since then, however, has been marked by [[politics of the Philippines|political]] instability and hampered economic productivity.

[[Fossil|Human fossil]] records indicate that the Philippines may have been inhabited for thousands of years. According to earlier archaeological findings, the first man in the Philippines came around islands with Asia which Professor H. [[Otley Beyer]], eminent [[United States|American]] authority on Philippine [[archeology]] and [[anthropology]], dubbed the "Dawn Man". Yet the oldest human fossil found in the Philippines thus far is the 22,000-year-old skull cap of a "Stone-Age Filipino" discovered by Dr. [[Robert B. Fox]], American anthropologist of the [[National Museum]], inside [[Tabon Cave]], [[Palawan]], on [[May 28]], [[1962]] and dubbed the "[[Tabon Man]]".

The Tabon caves of [[Palawan]] indicate settlement for at least 30,500 years; these hunter-gatherers used [[lithic flake|stone flake tool]]s. (In [[Mindanao]], the existence and importance of these prehistoric tools was noted by famed [[Jos<U+00E9> Rizal]] himself, because of his acquaintance with [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Germany|German]] scientific archaeologists in the 1880s, while in Europe.)

The social and political organization of the population, in the widely scattered islands, evolved into a generally common pattern. Only the permanent-field rice farmers of northern [[Luzon]] had any concept of territoriality.<ref name="uslc-3">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Early History|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/3.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> The basic unit of settlement was the [[barangay]], originally a kinship group headed by a [[datu]] (chief). Within the barangay, the broad social divisions consisted of the ''maharlika'' ([[nobility|nobles]]), including the datu; ''timawa'' ([[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]]); and a group described before the Spanish period as dependents. Dependents included several categories with differing status: landless agricultural workers; those who had lost freeman status because of indebtedness or punishment for crime; and ''alipin'' (slaves), most of whom appear to have been war captives.<ref name="uslc-3"/>

[[Islam]] was brought to the Philippines by traders and [[proselytizer]]s from the [[Indonesia|Indonesian islands]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Agoncillo |first=Teodoro C. |authorlink=Teodoro Agoncillo |title=History of the Filipino People |origyear=1960 |edition=8th edition |year=1990 |publisher=Garotech Publishing |location=Quezon City |id=ISBN 971-8711-06-6| pages=p. 22}}</ref> By the 13th century, Islam was established in the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and spread from there to [[Mindanao]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of Philippine History|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Philippine_history|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=2007}}</ref>; it had reached the [[Manila]] area by 1565.<ref name="uslc-3"/> Although Islam spread to Luzon, Animism was still the religion of the majority of the Philippine islands. Muslim immigrants introduced a political concept of territorial states ruled by [[raja]]s or [[sultan]]s who exercised [[suzerainty]] over the datu. Neither the political state concept of the Muslim rulers nor the limited territorial concept of the sedentary rice farmers of Luzon, however, spread beyond the areas where they originated.<ref name="uslc-3"/> When the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] arrived in the 16th century, the majority of the estimated 500,000 people in the islands lived in barangay settlements.<ref name="uslc-3"/>

==Spanish rule (1521<U+2013>1898)==
:''Main article: [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)]]''

===Early Spanish expeditions===
[[Image:Ferdinand Magellan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ferdinand Magellan]] arrived in the Philippines in 1521.]]
[[Image:Lapu-Lapu.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A statue of [[Lapu-Lapu]] marks the site where Magellan was purportedly killed in 1521.]]
The Philippine islands first came to the attention of [[Europe]]ans with the [[Spain|Spanish]] expedition around the world led by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521. Magellan landed on the island of [[Cebu]], claiming the lands for Spain and naming them ''Islas de San Lazaro''.<ref name="lac47">{{cite book|last=Lacsamana|first=Leodivico Cruz|title=Philippine History and Government, Second Edition|year=1990|publisher=Phoenix Publishing House, Inc.|pages=p. 47}}</ref> He established friendly relations with some of the local chieftains and converted some of them to [[Roman Catholicism]].<ref name="lac47"/> However, Magellan was killed in a dispute with indigenous tribal groups led by a chieftain named [[Lapu-Lapu]]. 

Over the next several decades, other Spanish expeditions were dispatched to the islands. In 1543, [[Ruy L<U+00F3>pez de Villalobos]] led an expedition to the islands and gave the name ''Las Islas Felipinas'' (after [[Philip II of Spain]]) to the islands of [[Samar]] and [[Leyte]].<ref>Lacsamana, Philippine History and Government, p. 52</ref> The name would later be given to the entire archipelago.

===Spanish colonization===
Permanent Spanish settlement was not established until 1565 when an expedition led by the [[Conquistador]], [[Miguel L<U+00F3>pez de Legazpi]], arrived in Cebu from [[Mexico]] ([[New Spain]]). Six years later, following the defeat of the local Muslim ruler, Rajah Solayman, Legazpi established a capital at [[Manila]], a location that offered the excellent harbor of [[Manila Bay]], a large population, and proximity to the ample food supplies of the [[central Luzon]] rice lands. Manila became the center of Spanish government, including military, religious, and commercial activities in the islands.<ref name="uslc-4">{{cite web|title=Philippines - The Early Spanish Period|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/4.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> Despite the opposition of the Portuguese, who desired to maintain their monopoly on [[East Indies]] trade, the Spanish had secured a foothold in the Philippines, which became their outpost as the [[Spanish East Indies]]. Spanish leadership was soon established over a large archipelago, including many independent communities that previously had known no central rule.<ref name="pinas">{{cite web|title=Philippine History|url=http://pinas.dlsu.edu.ph/history/history.html|publisher=DLSU-Manila|accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref>The Philippines was administered as a province of New Spain until [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican independence]] (1821).<ref name="eon">{{cite web|title=Philippines History|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Philippines-HISTORY.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of Nations|accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref>

Occupation of the islands was accomplished with relatively little bloodshed, partly because most of the population (except the Muslims) offered little armed resistance initially.<ref name="uslc-4"/> A significant problem the Spanish faced was the subjugation of the Muslims of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. The Muslims, in response to attacks on them from the Spanish and their native allies, raided areas of [[Luzon]] and the [[Visayas]] that were under Spanish colonial control. The Spanish conducted intermittent military campaigns against the Muslims, but without conclusive results until the middle of the 19th century.

[[Image:NewSpainFlag.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Flag of [[New Spain]]]]
Church and state were inseparably linked in Spanish policy, with the state assuming responsibility for religious establishments.<ref name="uslc-4"/> One of Spain's objectives in colonizing the Philippines was the conversion of the local population to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The work of conversion was facilitated by the absence of other organized religions, except for Islam, which predominated in the south. The pageantry of the church had a wide appeal, reinforced by the incorporation of Filipino social customs into religious observances.<ref name="uslc-4"/> The eventual outcome was a new [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority of the main Austronesian lowland population, from which the Muslims of Mindanao and the upland tribal peoples of Luzon remained detached and alienated (such as the Ifugaos of the Cordillera region and the Mangyans of Mindoro).<ref name="uslc-4"/>

At the lower levels of administration, the Spanish built on traditional village organization by co-opting local leaders. This system of indirect rule helped create a Filipino [[upper class]], called the ''[[principalia]]'', who had local wealth, high status, and other privileges. This perpetuated an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] system of local control. Among the most significant changes under Spanish rule was that the Filipino idea of communal use and ownership of land was replaced with the concept of private ownership and the conferring of titles on members of the principalia.<ref name="uslc-4"/>

The Philippines was not profitable as a colony, and a long war with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] in the 17th century and intermittent conflict with the Muslims nearly bankrupted the colonial treasury.<ref name="uslc-4"/> Colonial income derived mainly from [[entrep<U+00F4>t]] trade: The ''[[Manila Galleon]]s'' sailing from [[Acapulco]] on the west coast of New Spain brought shipments of [[silver bullion]] and minted coin that were exchanged for return cargoes of Chinese goods. There was no direct trade with Spain.<ref name="uslc-4"/>

===Decline of Spanish rule===
{{main|Philippine Revolution}}
Spanish rule on the Philippines was briefly interrupted in 1762, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops occupied Manila as a result of Spain's entry into the [[Seven Years' War]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris of 1763]] restored Spanish rule and in 1764 the British left the country fearing another costly war with Spain. The brief British occupation weakened Spain's grip on power and sparked rebellions and demands for independence.<ref name="uslc-5">{{cite web|title=Philippines - The Decline of Spanish Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/5.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref>

In 1781, Governor-General [[Jos<U+00E9> Basco y Vargas]] established the Economic Society of Friends of the Country. The Philippines by this time was administered directly from Spain. Developments in and out of the country helped to bring new ideas to the Philippines. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 cut travel time to Spain. This prompted the rise of the ''[[ilustrado|ilustrados]]'', an enlightened Filipino upper class, since many young Filipinos were able to study in Europe.

Enlightened by the [[Jos<U+00E9> Rizal#Legacy|Propaganda Movement]] to the injustices of the Spanish colonial government and the "frailocracy", the ''ilustrados'' originally clamored for adequate representation to the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortes]] and later for independence. [[Jos<U+00E9> Rizal]], the most celebrated intellectual and radical ''illustrado'' of the era, wrote the novels ''[[Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', which greatly inspired the movement for independence.<ref name="pinas"/> The [[Katipunan]], a [[secret society]] whose primary purpose was that of overthrowing Spanish rule in the Philippines, was founded by [[Andr<U+00E9>s Bonifacio]] who became its Supremo (leader).

[[Image:Bandera 03.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An early flag of the Filipino revolutionaries]]
The [[Philippine Revolution]] began in 1896. Rizal was implicated in the outbreak of the revolution and executed for [[treason]] in 1896. The Katipunan in [[Cavite]] split into two groups, ''[[Magdiwang]]'', led by [[Mariano Alvarez]] (a relative of Bonifacio's by marriage), and ''[[Magdalo]]'', led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Leadership conflicts between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo culminated in the execution or assassination of the former by the latter's soldiers. Aguinaldo agreed to a truce with the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] and Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were exiled to [[Hong Kong]]. Not all the revolutionary generals complied with the agreement. One, General [[Francisco Makabulos]], established a Central Executive Committee to serve as the [[interim government]] until a more suitable one was created. Armed conflicts resumed, this time coming from almost every  province in Spanish-governed Philippines. 

[[Image:Malolos congress.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A session of congress of the short-lived First Philippine Republic]]
In 1898, as conflicts continued in the Philppines, the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']], having been sent to [[Cuba]] because of [[United States|U.S.]] concerns for the safety of its citizens during an ongoing [[History_of_Cuba#Independence_from_Spain|Cuban revolution]], exploded and sank in [[Havana]] harbor.  This event precipitated the [[Spanish-American war]].<ref>{{cite web

After [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] defeated the Spanish squadron at Manila, the U.S. invited Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines, which he did on [[May 19]] [[1898]], in the hope he would rally Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government. By the time U.S. land forces had arrived, the Filipinos had taken control of the entire island of Luzon, except for the walled city of [[Intramuros]]. On [[June 12]] [[1898]], Aguinaldo declared the independence of the Philippines in [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]], [[Cavite]], establishing the [[First Philippine Republic]] under Asia's first democratic constitution.<ref name="pinas"/>

Simultaneously, a [[German Empire|German]] squadron arrived in Manila and declared that if the United States did not seize the Philippines as a colonial possession, Germany would. In the [[Battle of Manila (1898)|Battle of Manila]], the United States captured the city from the Spanish. This battle marked an end of Filipino-American collaboration, as Filipino forces were prevented from entering the captured city of Manila, an action deeply resented by the Filipinos.<ref name="lac126">Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 126</ref> Spain and the United States sent commissioners to Paris to draw up the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Spanish-American War. The Filipino representative, [[Felipe Agoncillo]], was excluded from sessions as the revolutionary government was not recognized by the family of nations.<ref name="lac126"/> Although there was substantial domestic opposition, the United States decided neither to return the Philippines to Spain, nor to allow Germany to annex the Philippines. In addition to [[Guam]] and [[Puerto Rico]], Spain was forced in the negotiations to hand over the Philippines to the U.S. in exchange for [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000,000.00,<ref name="uslc-14">{{cite web|title=Philippines - The Malolos Constitution and the Treaty of Paris|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/14.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> which the U.S. later claimed to be a "gift" from Spain.<ref>{{cite web

Filipinos initially saw their relationship with the United States as that of two nations joined in a common struggle against Spain.<ref>Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 135</ref> As allies, Filipinos had provided the American forces with valuable intelligence and military support.<ref name="uslc-13">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Spanish American War|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/13.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> However, the United States later distanced itself from the interests of the Filipino insurgents. Aguinaldo was unhappy that the United States would not commit to paper a statement of support for [[Philippine independence]].<ref name="uslc-13"/> Relations deteriorated and tensions heightened as it became clear that the Americans were in the islands to stay.<ref name="uslc-13"/>

===Philippine-American War===
:''Main article: [[Philippine-American War]]''

Hostilities broke out on [[February 4]], [[1899]], after two American privates on patrol killed three Filipino soldiers in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], a [[Manila]] suburb.<ref name="uslc-15">{{cite web|title=Philippines - War of Resistance|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/15.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> This incident sparked the [[Philippine-American War]], which would cost far more money and took far more lives than the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref name="pinas"/> Some 126,000 American soldiers would be committed to the conflict; 4,234 Americans died, as did 16,000 Filipino soldiers who were part of a nationwide [[guerrilla]] movement of indeterminate numbers.<ref name="uslc-15"/> Estimates on civilian deaths during the war range between 250,000 and 1,000,000, largely because of famine and disease. Atrocities were committed by both sides.<ref name="uslc-15"/>

The poorly-equipped Filipino troops were easily overpowered by American troops in open combat, but they were formidable opponents in guerrilla warfare.<ref name="uslc-15"/> [[Malolos City|Malolos]], the revolutionary capital, was captured on [[March 31]], [[1899]]. Aguinaldo and his government escaped however, establishing a new capital at [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija]]. [[Antonio Luna]], Aguinaldo's most capable military commander, [[Gregorio del Pilar]], was murdered in June at Tirad Pass. With his best commander dead and his troops suffering continued defeats as American forces pushed into northern [[Luzon]], Aguinaldo dissolved the regular army in November 1899 and ordered the establishment of decentralized guerrilla commands in each of several military zones. The general population, caught between Americans and rebels, suffered significantly.<ref name="uslc-15"/>

Aguinaldo was captured at [[Palanan, Isabela]] on [[March 23]], [[1901]] and was brought to Manila. Convinced of the futility of further resistance, he swore allegiance to the United States and issued a proclamation calling on his compatriots to lay down their arms, officially bringing an end to the war.<ref name="uslc-15"/> However, sporadic insurgent resistance continued in various parts of the Philippines, especially in the Muslim south, until 1913.<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 247<U+2013>260, 294<U+2013>297</ref>

===United States colony===
The United States defined its colonial mission as one of tutelage, preparing the Philippines for eventual independence.<ref name="uslc-16">{{cite web|title=Philippines - United States Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/16.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> Civil government was established by the United States in 1901, with [[William Howard Taft]] as the first American [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], replacing the military governor, [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]] The governor-general acted as head of the [[Philippine Commission]], a body appointed by the U.S. president with legislative and limited executive powers. The commission passed laws to set up the fundamentals of the new government, including a judicial system, civil service, and local government. A [[Philippine Constabulary]] was organized to deal with the remnants of the insurgent movement and gradually assume the responsibilities of the [[United States Army]]. The elected [[Philippine Assembly]] was inaugurated in 1907, becoming a lower house of a [[bicameral legislature]], with the appointed Philippine Commission as upper house.

United States policies towards the Philippines shifted with changing administrations.<ref name="pinas"/> During the early years of colonial rule, the Americans were reluctant to delegate authority to the Filipinos. However, when [[Woodrow Wilson]] became [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] in 1913, a new policy was adopted to put into motion a process that would gradually lead to Philippine independence. The [[Jones Act (Philippines)|Jones Act]], passed by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1916 to serve as the new [[organic law]] in the Philippines, promised eventual independence and instituted an elected [[Philippine senate]].

The 1920s saw alternating periods of cooperation and confrontation with American governors-general, depending on how intent the incumbent was on exercising his powers vis-<U+00E0>-vis the Philippine legislature. Members to the elected legislature lobbied for immediate and complete independence from the United States. Several independence missions were sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] A civil service was formed and was gradually taken over by Filipinos, who had effectively gained control by 1918.

Philippine politics during the American colonial era was dominated by the [[Nacionalista Party]], which was founded in 1907. Although the party's platform called for "immediate independence", their policy toward the Americans was highly accommodating.<ref name="uslc-17">{{cite web|title=Philippines - A Collaborative Philippine Leadership|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/17.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> Within the political establishment, the call for independence was spearheaded by [[Manuel L. Quezon]], who served continuously as [[Senate president]] from 1916 until 1935.

===Commonwealth===
:''Main article: [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]''
[[Image:Quezon Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] with United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In 1933, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act]] as a Philippine Independence Act over President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s veto.<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 345<U+2013>346</ref> Though the bill had been drafted with the aid of a commission from the Philippines, it was opposed by Philippine Senate President [[Manuel L. Quezon]], partially because of provisions leaving the United States in control of naval bases. Under his influence, the Philippine legislature rejected the bill.<ref name="uslc-20">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Commonwealth Politics|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/20.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> The following year, a revised act known as the [[Tydings-McDuffie Act]] was finally passed. The act provided for the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] with a ten-year period of peaceful transition to full independence. The commonwealth would have its own constitution and be self-governing, though foreign policy would be the responsibility of the United States, and certain legislation required approval of the United States president.<ref name="uslc-20"/>

A constitution was framed in 1934 and overwhelmingly approved by plebiscite the following year. On [[May 14]] [[1935]], an election to fill the newly created office of President of the Commonwealth was won by [[Manuel L. Quezon]] of the [[Nacionalista Party]], and a Filipino government was formed on the basis of principles similar to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The commonwealth was established in 1935, featuring a very strong [[executive (government)|executive]], a unicameral [[National Assembly]], and a [[Supreme Court]] composed entirely of Filipinos for the first time since 1901. During the commonwealth years, Philippines sent one elected [[Resident Commissioners from the Philippines|Resident Commissioner]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] (as [[Puerto Rico]] does today).

The new government embarked on an ambitious agenda of establishing the basis for national defense, greater control over the economy, reforms in education, improvement of transport, the colonization of the island of Mindanao, and the promotion of local capital and industrialization. The commonwealth, however, was also faced with agrarian unrest, an uncertain diplomatic and military situation in [[Southeast Asia]], and uncertainty about the level of United States commitment to the future Republic of the Philippines. In 1939<U+2013>40, the Philippine Constitution was amended to restore a bicameral congress, and permit the reelection of President Quezon, who was previously restricted to a single six-year term.

===World War II and Japanese occupation===
[[Image:Ww2 131.jpg|thumb|left|200px|As many as 10,000 people died in the [[Bataan Death March]].]]
[[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched a surprise [[Battle of the Philippines (1942)|attack on the Clark Air Base in Pampanga, Philippines]] on [[December 8]] [[1941]], just ten hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Aerial bombardment was followed by landings of ground troops on Luzon. The defending Philippine and United States troops were under the command of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Under the pressure of superior numbers, the defending forces withdrew to the [[Bataan Peninsula]] and to the island of [[Corregidor]] at the entrance to Manila Bay. The capital city, Manila, declared an [[open city]] to prevent its destruction,<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 390</ref> was occupied by the Japanese on [[January 2]] [[1942]].<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 392</ref> The Philippine defense continued until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in April 1942 and on Corregidor in May of the same year. Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese at Bataan were forced to undertake the infamous [[Bataan Death March]] to a prison camp 105&nbsp;kilometers to the north. It is estimated that about 10,000 Filipinos and 1,200 Americans died before reaching their destination.<ref>Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 168</ref>

President Quezon and Osme<U+00F1>a had accompanied the troops to Corregidor and later left for the United States, where they set up a government in exile.<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 415</ref> MacArthur was ordered to [[Australia]], where he started to plan for a return to the Philippines.

The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the [[Philippine Executive Commission]]. They initially organized a [[Philippine Council of State|Council of State]] through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored republic headed by President [[Jos<U+00E9> P. Laurel]] proved to be unpopular.<ref name="uslc-21">{{cite web|title=Philippines - World War II|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/21.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref>

Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The [[Philippine Army]] continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war and was considered an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]].<ref name="uslc-21"/> The major element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the [[Hukbalahap]] ("People's Army Against the Japanese"), which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon.<ref name="uslc-21"/>

MacArthur's [[Allied forces]] landed on Leyte on [[October 20]], [[1944]]. Landings in other parts of the country followed, and the Allies pushed toward Manila. Fighting continued until Japan's formal surrender on [[September 2]], [[1945]]. The Philippines suffered great loss of life and tremendous physical destruction by the time the war was over. An estimated 1 million Filipinos had been killed, and Manila was extensively damaged as the Japanese did not declare it an open city as the Americans had done in 1942.<ref name="uslc-21"/>

==Independent Philippines and the Third Republic (1946<U+2013>1972)==

Elections were held in April 1946, with [[Manuel Roxas]] becoming the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines. The [[United States]] receded its sovereignty over the Philippines on [[July 4]] [[1946]], as scheduled.<ref name="pinas"/> However, the [[Economy of the Philippines|Philippine economy]] remained highly dependent on [[Economy of the United States|United States markets]]&ndash; more dependent, according to United States high commissioner [[Paul McNutt]], than any single [[U.S. state]] was dependent on the rest of the country.<ref name="uslc-23">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Economic Relations with the United States|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/23.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> The [[Philippine Trade Act]], passed as a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States,<ref name="beterano">{{cite web|title=Balitang Beterano: Facts about Philippine Independence|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/tl/tl012375.htm|publisher=Philippine Headline News Online|accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref> exacerbated the dependency with provisions further tying the economies of the two countries. A military assistance pact was signed in 1947 granting the United States a 99-year lease on designated [[military base]]s in the country (the lease was later reduced to 25 years beginning 1967).

The Roxas administration granted general [[amnesty]] to those who had collaborated with the Japanese in World War II, except for those who had committed violent crimes. Roxas died suddenly of a heart attack in April 1948, and the vice president, [[Elpidio Quirino]], was elevated to the presidency. He ran for president in his own right in 1949, defeating [[Jose P. Laurel]] and winning a four-year term.

World War II had left the Philippines demoralized and severely damaged. The task of reconstruction was complicated by the activities of the [[Communism|Communist]]-supported [[Hukbalahap]] guerrillas (known as "Huks"), who had evolved into a violent resistance force against the new Philippine government. Government policy towards the Huks alternated between gestures of negotiation and harsh suppression. Secretary of Defense [[Ramon Magsaysay]] initiated a campaign to defeat the insurgents militarily and at the same time win popular support for the government. The Huk movement had waned in the early 1950s, finally ending with the unconditional surrender of Huk leader [[Luis Taruc]] in May 1954.

Supported by the United States, Magsaysay was elected president in 1953 on a [[populism|populist]] platform. He promised sweeping economic reform, and made progress in [[land reform]] by promoting the resettlement of poor people in the Catholic north into traditionally Muslim areas. Though this relieved population pressure in the north, it heightened religious hostilities.<ref name="uslc-26">{{cite web|title=Philippines - The Magsaysay, Garcia, and Macapagal Administrations|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/26.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> Nevertheless, he was extremely popular with the common people, and his death in an airplane crash in March 1957 dealt a serious blow to national morale.

[[Carlos P. Garcia]] succeeded to the presidency after Magsaysay's death, and was elected to a four-year term in the election of November that same year. His administration emphasized the nationalist theme of "Filipino first", arguing that the Filipino people should be given the chances to improve the country's economy.<ref name="cgarcia">{{cite web|title=Carlos Garcia: Unheralded nationalist|url=http://www.philippinenews.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=555a3972999c72ad3bc05bbadf8225f6|publisher=Philippine News Online|accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref> Garcia successfully negotiated for the United States' relinquishment of large military land reservations. However, his administration lost popularity on issues of government corruption as his term advanced.<ref>Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 184</ref>

[[Diosdado Macapagal]] was elected president in the 1961 election, defeating Garcia's re-election bid. Macapagal's foreign policy sought closer relations with neighboring Asian nations, particularly [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (later [[Malaysia]]) and [[Indonesia]].<ref name="uslc-26"/> Negotiations with the United States over base rights led to anti-American sentiment.<ref name="uslc-26"/> Notably, the celebration of [[Independence Day]] was changed from [[July 4]] to [[June 12]], to honor the day that [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] declared independence from [[Spain]] in 1898.

==Marcos era and martial law (1965<U+2013>1986)==
:''Main article: [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)]]''

Macapagal ran for re-election in 1965, but was defeated by his former party-mate, Senate President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who had switched to the Nacionalista Party. Early in his presidency, Marcos initiated ambitious public works projects and intensified tax collection which brought the country economic prosperity throughout the 1970s. His administration built more roads (including a substantial portion of the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]]) than all his predecessors combined, and more schools than any previous administration.<ref>Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 187</ref> Marcos was re-elected president in 1969, becoming the first president of the independent Philippines to achieve a second term.

The Philippine Legislature was corrupt and impotent. Opponents of Marcos blocked the necessary legislation to implement his ambitious plans. Because of this, optimism faded early in his second term and economic growth slowed.<ref name="uslc-27">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Marcos and the Road to Martial Law|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/27.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> Crime and civil disobedience increased. The [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] formed the [[New People's Army]]. The [[Moro National Liberation Front]] continued to fight for an independent Muslim nation in Mindanao. An explosion during the proclamation rally of the senatorial slate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] on [[August 21]], [[1971]] prompted Marcos to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]], which he restored on [[January 11]], [[1972]] after public protests.

===Martial law===
Amidst the rising wave of lawlessness and the threat of a Communist insurgency, Marcos declared [[martial law]] on [[September 21]], [[1972]] by virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081]]. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, closed down Congress and media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including his staunchest critics senators [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and [[Jose Diokno]].<ref name="uslc-28">{{cite web|title=Philippines - Proclamation 1081 and Martial Law|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/28.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> The declaration of martial law was initially well received, given the social turmoil the Philippines was experiencing.<ref>Lacsamana, ''Philippine History and Government'', p. 189</ref> Crime rates plunged dramatically after a curfew was implemented.<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 576<U+2013>577</ref> Many political opponents were forced to go into exile.

A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], which had been called for in 1970 to replace the colonial [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]], continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and allowing Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973.

Marcos claimed that martial law was the prelude to creating a "New Society" based on new social and political values.<ref>Agoncillo, ''History of the Filipino People'', p. 574<U+2013>575</ref> The economy during the 1970s was robust, with budgetary and trade surpluses. The [[Gross National Product]] rose from P55 billion in 1972 to P193 billion in 1980. Tourism rose, contributing to the economy's growth. However, Marcos, his cronies and his wife, [[Imelda Romualdez-Marcos]], wilfully engaged in rampant corruption.<ref name="uslc-pro">{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Philippines, March 2006|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref>

===Fourth Republic===
Appeasing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] before the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]],<ref>{{cite web|title=In many tongues, pope championed religious freedoms|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/03/Worldandnation/In_many_tongues__pope.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref> Marcos officially lifted martial law on [[January 17]], [[1981]]. However, he retained much of the government's power for arrest and detention. Corruption and nepotism as well as civil unrest contributed to a serious decline in economic growth and development under Marcos, whose health declined due to [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]].

The political opposition boycotted the [[Philippine general election, 1981|1981 presidential elections]], which pitted Marcos against retired general [[Alejo Santos]].<ref name="uslc-28"/> Marcos won by a margin of over 16 million votes, which constitutionally allowed him to have another six-year term. Finance Minister [[Cesar Virata]] was elected as Prime Minister by the [[Batasang Pambansa]].

In 1983, opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was assassinated at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]] upon his return to the Philippines after a long period of exile.  This coalesced popular dissatisfaction with Marcos and began a succession of events, including pressure from the United States, that culminated in [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|a snap presidential election]] in February 1986.<ref name="uslc-29">{{cite web|title=Philippines - From Aquino's Assassination to People Power|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/29.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> The opposition united under Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino]].

The official election canvasser, the [[Commission on Elections]] (Comelec), declared Marcos the winner of the election. However, there was a large discrepancy between the Comelec results and that of [[Namfrel]], an accredited poll watcher. The allegedly fraudulent result was rejected by Corazon Aquino and her supporters. International observers, including a U.S. delegation, denounced the official results.<ref name="uslc-29"/> Gen. [[Fidel Ramos]] and Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] withdrew their support for Marcos. A peaceful civilian-military uprising, now popularly called the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]], forced Marcos into exile and installed Corazon Aquino as president on [[February 25]] [[1986]].

In [[1991]], the Philippine Senate rejected a treaty that would have allowed a 10-year extension of the U.S. military bases in the country. The United States turned over [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Pampanga]] to the government in November, and [[Subic Bay Naval Base]] in [[Zambales]] in December 1992, ending almost a century of U.S. military presence in the Philippines.

In the [[Philippine general election, 1992|1992 elections]], Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]], endorsed by Aquino, won the presidency with just 23.6% of the vote in a field of seven candidates. Early in his administration, Ramos declared "national reconciliation" his highest priority and worked at building a coalition to overcome the divisiveness of the Aquino years.<ref name="usdos"/> He legalized the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Communist Party]] and laid the groundwork for talks with communist insurgents, [[Muslim]] separatists, and military rebels, attempting to convince them to cease their armed activities against the government. In June 1994, Ramos signed into law a general conditional [[amnesty]] covering all rebel groups, and Philippine military and police personnel accused of crimes committed while fighting the insurgents. In October 1995, the government signed an agreement bringing the military insurgency to an end. A peace agreement with the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF), a major separatist group fighting for an independent homeland in [[Mindanao]], was signed in 1996, ending the 24-year old struggle. However, an MNLF splinter group, the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] continued the armed struggle for an Islamic state. Efforts by Ramos supporters to gain passage of an amendment that would allow him to run for a second term were met with large-scale protests, leading Ramos to declare he would not seek re-election.<ref name="asiaweek">{{cite web|title=Showdown in Manila|url=http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1003/nat1.html|publisher=Asiaweek|accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref>

[[Joseph Estrada]], a former movie actor who had served as Ramos' vice president, was elected president by a landslide victory in 1998. His election campaign pledged to help the poor and develop the country's agricultural sector. He enjoyed widespread popularity, particularly among the poor.<ref name="bbc-erap">{{cite web|title=Profile:Joseph Estrada|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1063976.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> Under the cloud of the [[Asian financial crisis]] which began in 1997, Estrada's wayward governance took a heavy toll on the economy. Unemployment worsened, the budget deficit grew, the currency plunged. Eventually, the country's economy recovered but at a much slower pace than that of its Asian neighbors.

Within a year of his election, Estrada's popularity declined sharply amid allegations of cronyism and corruption, and failure to remedy the problems of poverty.<ref name="uslc-pro"/> In October 2000, Estrada was accused of having accepted millions of pesos in payoffs from illegal gambling businesses. He was [[impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Representatives, but his impeachment trial in the Senate broke down when the senate voted to block examination of the president's bank records. In response, massive street protests erupted demanding Estrada's resignation. Faced with street protests, cabinet resignations, and a withdrawal of support from the armed forces, Estrada was forced from office on [[January 20]] [[2001]].

Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] (the daughter of the late President [[Diosdado Macapagal]]) was sworn in as Estrada's successor on the day of his departure. Her accession to power was further legitimated by the mid-term congressional and local elections held four months later, when her coalition won an overwhelming victory.<ref name="uslc-pro"/> Arroyo's initial term in office was marked by fractious coalition politics as well as a military mutiny in Manila in July 2003 that led her to declare a month-long nationwide state of rebellion.<ref name="uslc-pro"/>

Arroyo had declared in December 2002 that she would not run in the May 2004 presidential election, but she reversed herself in October 2003 and decided to join the race.<ref name="uslc-pro"/> She was re-elected and sworn in for her own six-year term as president on [[June 30]] [[2004]]. In 2005, a tape of a wiretapped conversation surfaced bearing the voice of Arroyo apparently asking an election official if her margin of victory could be maintained.<ref name="cnn-trans">{{cite web|title=Gloria Macapagal Arroyo Talkasia Transcript|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/talkasia.arroyo.script/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-07-29}}</ref> The tape sparked protests calling for Arroyo's resignation.<ref name="cnn-trans"/> Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to an election official, but denied allegations of fraud and refused to step down.<ref name="cnn-trans"/> Attempts to impeach the president failed later that year.

Arroyo currently spearheads a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present presidential-bicameral republic into a federal parliamentary-unicameral form of government.<ref>{{cite news|first=Lira|last=Dalangin-Fernandez|url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106|title=People's support for Charter change 'nowhere to go but up'|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=[[2006-07-27]]|accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref>
