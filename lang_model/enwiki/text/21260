The '''Spanish conquest of Guatemala''' was a conflict that formed a part of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] within the territory of what became the modern country of [[Guatemala]] in [[Central America]]. Before the conquest, this territory contained a number of competing [[Mesoamerica]]n kingdoms, the majority of which were [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Many [[conquistador]]s viewed the Maya as "[[infidel]]s" who needed to be forcefully converted and pacified, disregarding the achievements of their [[Maya civilization|civilization]].<ref name="Jones00p356">Jones 2000, p. 356.</ref> The first contact between the Maya and [[European colonization of the Americas|European explorers]] came in the early 16th century when a [[Spain|Spanish]] ship sailing from [[Panama]] to [[Hispaniola|Santo Domingo]] was wrecked on the east coast of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] in 1511.<ref name="Jones00p356"/> Several Spanish expeditions followed in 1517 and 1519, making landfall on various parts of the Yucat<U+00E1>n coast.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 356<U+2013>358.</ref> The Spanish conquest of the Maya was a prolonged affair; the Maya kingdoms resisted integration into the [[Spanish Empire]] with such tenacity that their defeat took almost two centuries.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 8, 757.</ref>

[[Pedro de Alvarado]] arrived in Guatemala from the newly-conquered Mexico in early 1524, commanding a mixed force of Spanish conquistadors and native allies, mostly from [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. Placenames across Guatemala bear [[Nahuatl]] placenames owing to the influence of these Mexican allies, who translated for the Spanish.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p764"/> The [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel Maya]] initially allied themselves with the Spanish, but soon rebelled against excessive demands for tribute and did not finally surrender until 1530. In the meantime the other major highland Maya kingdoms had each been defeated in turn by the Spanish and allied warriors from Mexico and already subjugated Maya kingdoms in Guatemala. The [[Itza people|Itza Maya]] and other lowland groups in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin]] were first contacted by [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] in 1525, but remained independent and hostile to the encroaching Spanish until 1697, when a concerted Spanish assault finally defeated the last independent Maya kingdom.

Spanish and native tactics and technology differed greatly. The Spanish viewed the taking of prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. The indigenous peoples of Guatemala lacked key elements of [[Old World]] technology such as a functional [[Wheel#History|wheel]], horses, steel and [[gunpowder]]; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance. The Maya preferred raiding and ambush to large-scale [[Maya warfare|warfare]], using spears, arrows and wooden swords with inset [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] blades; the [[Xinca people|Xinca]] of the southern coastal plain used [[Arrow poison|poison]] on their arrows. In response to the use of Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes.

The sources describing the Spanish conquest of Guatemala include those written by the Spanish themselves, among them two of four letters written by conquistador Pedro de Alvarado to Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s in 1524, describing the initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands. These letters were dispatched to [[Tenochtitlan]], addressed to Cort<U+00E9>s but with a royal audience in mind; two of these letters are now lost.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 23.</ref> [[Gonzalo de Alvarado#Gonzalo de Alvarado y Ch<U+00E1>vez|Gonzalo de Alvarado y Ch<U+00E1>vez]] was Pedro de Alvarado's cousin; he accompanied him on his first campaign in Guatemala and in 1525 he became the chief constable of [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]], the newly founded Spanish capital. Gonzalo wrote an account that mostly supports that of Pedro de Alvarado. Pedro de Alvarado's brother Jorge wrote another account to the king of Spain that explained it was his own campaign of 1527<U+2013>1529 that established the Spanish colony.<ref name="Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p.49">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 49.</ref> [[Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo]] wrote a lengthy account of the conquest of Mexico and neighbouring regions, the ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa<U+00F1>a]]'' ("True History of the Conquest of New Spain"); his account of the conquest of Guatemala generally agrees with that of the Alvarados.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 49<U+2013>50.</ref> His account was finished around 1568, some 40 years after the campaigns it describes.<ref>D<U+00ED>az del Castillo 1632, 2005, p. 5.</ref> Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s described his expedition to [[Honduras]] in the fifth letter of his ''Cartas de Relaci<U+00F3>n'',<ref>Cort<U+00E9>s 1844, 2005, p. xxi.</ref> in which he details his crossing of what is now Guatemala's [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department]]. [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Bartolom<U+00E9> de las Casas]] wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 50.</ref> The ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies|Brev<U+00ED>sima Relaci<U+00F3>n de la Destrucci<U+00F3>n de las Indias]]'' ("Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies") was first published in 1552 in [[Seville]].<ref>de Las Casas 1552, 1997, p. 13.</ref>

The [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcalan]] allies of the Spanish who accompanied them in their invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included a letter to the Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 79<U+2013>81.</ref> Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the ''Lienzo de Quauhquechollan'', which was probably painted in [[Ciudad Vieja]] in the 1530s, and the ''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'', painted in Tlaxcala.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 94.</ref>

Accounts of the conquest as seen from the point of view of the defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the ''[[Annals of the Cakchiquels|Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation down through the Spanish conquest and continuing to 1619.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 103<U+2013>104.</ref> A letter from the defeated [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil Maya]] nobility of [[Santiago Atitl<U+00E1>n]] to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.<ref name="ReferenceA">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 111.</ref>

[[Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm<U+00E1>n]] was a colonial Guatemalan historian of Spanish descent who wrote ''La Recordaci<U+00F3>n Florida'', also called ''Historia de Guatemala'' (''History of Guatemala''). The book was written in 1690 and is regarded as one of the most important works of Guatemalan history, and is the first such book to have been written by a [[Criollo people|criollo]] author.<ref>Lara Figueroa 2000, p. 1.</ref> Field investigation has tended to support the estimates of indigenous population and army sizes given by Fuentes y Guzm<U+00E1>n.<ref>Lovell 2005, p. 69.</ref>

==Background to the conquest==
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the New World for the [[Kingdom of Castile and Leon]] in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. xix.</ref> In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the [[Caribbean]] and established a centre of operations on the island of [[Cuba]]. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the [[Aztec]]s on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 272.</ref> By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 276.</ref> A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying [[smallpox]] and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 279.</ref> Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. The newly conquered territory became [[New Spain]], headed by a [[List of viceroys of New Spain|viceroy]] who answered to the king of Spain via the [[Council of the Indies]].<ref>Coe and Koontz 2002, p. 229.</ref> Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s received reports of rich, populated lands to the south and dispatched Pedro de Alvarado to investigate the region.<ref name="Lovell05p58">Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref>

==Guatemala before the conquest==
[[File:Guatemala Topography.png|thumb|right|Relief map of Guatemala showing the three broad geographical areas: the southern Pacific lowlands, the highlands and the northern Pet<U+00E9>n lowlands|alt=Guatemala is situated between the Pacific Ocean to the south and the Caribbean Sea to the northeast. The broad band of the Sierra Madre mountains sweeps down from Mexico in the west, across southern and central Guatemala and into El Salvador and Honduras to the east. The north is dominated by a broad lowland plain that extends eastwards into Belize and north into Mexico. A narrower plain separates the Sierra Madre from the Pacific Ocean to the south.]]
In the early 16th century the territory that now makes up Guatemala was divided into various competing polities, each locked in continual struggle with its neighbours.<ref>Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 14.</ref> The most important were the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], the Kaqchikel, the Tz'utujil, the [[Chajoma]],<ref>Hill 1998, pp. 229, 233.</ref> the [[Mam people|Mam]], the [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]] and the [[Pipil people|Pipil]].<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p6">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 6.</ref> All were Maya groups except for the Pipil, who were a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] group related to the Aztecs; the Pipil had a number of small [[city-state]]s along the Pacific coastal plain of southern Guatemala and [[El Salvador]].<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p25">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 25.</ref> The Pipil of Guatemala had their capital at Itzcuintepec.<ref>Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 123.</ref> The [[Xinca people|Xinca]] were another non-Maya group occupying the southeastern Pacific coastal area.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 26. Jim<U+00E9>nez 2006, p. 1. n. 1.</ref> The Maya had never been unified as a single empire, but by the time the Spanish arrived Maya civilization was thousands of years old and had already seen the rise and fall of [[Maya city|great cities]].<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p4">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 4.</ref>

On the eve of the conquest the [[Guatemalan Highlands|highlands of Guatemala]] were dominated by several powerful Maya states.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 717.</ref> In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish the K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K'iche' allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with [[Iximche]] as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p5">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 5.</ref> Other highland groups included the Tz'utujil around [[Lake Atitl<U+00E1>n]], the Mam in the western highlands and the Poqomam in the eastern highlands.<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p6"/>

The kingdom of the Itza was the most powerful polity in the Pet<U+00E9>n lowlands of northern Guatemala,<ref name="Rice09p17">Rice 2009, p. 17.</ref> centred on their capital [[Tayasal|Nojpet<U+00E9>n]], on an island in [[Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]]. The second polity in importance was that of their hostile neighbours, the [[Ko'woj|Kowoj]]. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n, Lake Macanch<U+00E9>, [[Laguna Yaxh<U+00E1>|Lake Yaxh<U+00E1>]] and Lake Sacnab.<ref>Rice and Rice 2009, p. 10. Rice 2009, p. 17.</ref> Other groups are less well known and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]], the [[Mopan people|Mopan]], the Manche [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] and the Yalain.<ref>Rice 2009, p. 17. Feldman 2000, p. xxi.</ref> The Kejache occupied an area north of the lake on the route to [[Campeche]], while the Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Rice 2009, p. 19.</ref> The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. xxi.</ref> The Yalain had their territory immediately to the east of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>.<ref>Rice and Rice 2009, pp. 8, 11<U+2013>12.</ref>

===Native weapons and tactics===
[[Maya warfare]] was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.<ref name="Phillips0607p95">Phillips 2006, 2007, p. 95.</ref> The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Pet<U+00E9>n Maya as bows and arrows, [[Fire hardening|fire-sharpened]] poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]],<ref>Rice et al 2009, p. 129.</ref> similar to the Aztec ''[[macuahuitl]]''. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows.<ref name="Letona5"/> Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans.<ref name="Phillips0607p94">Phillips 2006, 2007, p. 94.</ref> In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 73, 108.</ref>

==Conquistadors==
[[File:Map of the Spanish Conquest of Guatemala.png|thumb|right|450px|Map of the principle entry routes and battle sites of the conquest of Guatemala|alt=Pedro de Alvarado entered Guatemala from the west along the southern Pacific plain in 1524, before swinging northwards and fighting a number of battles to enter the highlands. He then executed a broad loop around the north side of the highland Lake Atitl<U+00E1>n, fighting further battles along the way, before descending southwards once more into the Pacific lowlands. Two more battles were fought as his forces headed east into what is now El Salvador. In 1525 Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s entered northern Guatemala from the north, crossed to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> and continued roughly southeast to Lake Izabal before turning east to the Gulf of Honduras.]]
The conquistadors were all volunteers, the majority of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead a portion of the spoils of victory, in the form of [[precious metal]]s, land grants and provision of native labour.<ref>Polo Sifontes 1986, pp. 57<U+2013>58.</ref> Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe.<ref name="PoloSifontes86p62">Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 62.</ref> The initial incursion into Guatemala was led by Pedro de Alvarado, who earned the military title of ''[[Adelantado]]'' in 1527;<ref>Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 61. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 124.</ref> he answered to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] via Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s in Mexico.<ref name="PoloSifontes86p62"/> Other early conquistadors included Pedro de Alvarado's brothers G<U+00F3>mez de Alvarado, [[Jorge de Alvarado]] and [[Gonzalo de Alvarado#Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras|Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras]]; and his cousins Gonzalo de Alvarado y Ch<U+00E1>vez, Hernando de Alvarado and Diego de Alvarado.<ref name="Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p.49"/> Pedro de Portocarrero was a nobleman who joined the initial invasion.<ref name="PoloSifontes86p61">Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 61.</ref> Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo was a petty nobleman who accompanied Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s when he crossed the northern lowlands, and Pedro de Alvarado on his invasion of the highlands.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761.  D<U+00ED>az del Castillo 1632, 2005, p. 10. Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 8.</ref>

===Spanish weapons and tactics===
Spanish weaponry and tactics differed greatly from that of the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. This included the Spanish use of [[crossbow]]s, [[History of the firearm|firearms]] (including [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]),<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 15, 61.</ref> [[Dogs in warfare|war dogs]] and [[Horses in warfare|war horses]].<ref name="Drew99p382"/> Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory.<ref name="Drew99p382">Drew 1999, p. 382.</ref> The inhabitants of Guatemala, for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, such as the use of iron and steel and functional wheels.<ref>Webster 2002, p. 77.</ref> The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion.<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p15">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 15.</ref> The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour.<ref name="Phillips0607p94"/>

In Guatemala the Spanish routinely fielded indigenous allies; at first these were Nahua brought from the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the field of battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive.<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p16">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 16.</ref>

The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'' (also known as ''congregaciones''). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as mountains and forests.<ref name="Hinz0810p36"/>

==Impact of Old World diseases==
Epidemics accidentally introduced by the Spanish included [[History of smallpox#epidemics in the Americas|smallpox]], [[measles]] and [[influenza]]. These diseases, together with [[typhus]] and [[yellow fever]], had a major impact on Maya populations.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 363.</ref> The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous [[New World]] peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 762<U+2013>763.</ref> Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.<ref name="Coe99p231"/>

In 1519 and 1520, before the arrival of the Spanish in the region, a number of epidemics swept through southern Guatemala.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 3.</ref> At the same time as the Spanish were occupied with the overthrow of the Aztec empire, a devastating plague struck the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche, and the city of Q'umarkaj, capital of the K'iche', may also have suffered from the same epidemic.<ref>Carmack 2001b, p. 172.</ref> It is likely that the same combination of smallpox and a pulmonary plague swept across the entire Guatemalan Highlands.<ref>Lovell 2005, p. 70.</ref> Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33<U+2013>50% of the population of the highlands perished. Population levels in the Guatemalan Highlands did not recover to their pre-conquest levels until the middle of the 20th century.<ref name="Lovel05p71">Lovell 2005, p. 71.</ref> In 1666 pestilence or [[murine typhus]] swept through what is now the department of Huehuetenango. Smallpox was reported in San Pedro Saloma, in 1795.<ref name="Hinz0810p37">Hinz 2008, 2010, p. 37.</ref>  At the time of the fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 364.</ref>

==Conquest of the highlands==
[[File:Postclassicguatemalahighlands.png|thumb|right|350px|Map of the Guatemalan Highlands on the eve of the Spanish conquest|alt=The highlands of Guatemala are bordered by the Pacific plain to the south, with the coast running to the southwest. The Kaqchikel kingdom was centred on Iximche, located roughly half way between Lake Atitl<U+00E1>n to the west and modern Guatemala City to the east. The Tz'utujil kingdom was based around the south shore of the lake, extending into the Pacific lowlands. The Pipil were situated further east along the Pacific plain and the Pocomam occupied the highlands to the east of modern Guatemala City. The K'iche' kingdom extended to the north and west of the lake with principal settlements at Xelaju, Totonicapan, Q'umarkaj, Pismachi' and Jakawitz. The Mam kingdom covered the western highlands bordering modern Mexico.]]
The conquest of the highlands was made difficult by the many independent polities in the region, rather than one powerful enemy to be defeated as was the case in central Mexico.<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 59<U+2013>60.</ref> After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s to declare their allegiance to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of [[Q'umarkaj]] may also have sent a delegation.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p763">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763.</ref> In 1522 Cort<U+00E9>s sent Mexican allies to scout the [[Soconusco]] region of lowland [[Chiapas]], where they met new delegations from the Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxp<U+00E1>n;<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 3.</ref> both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|king of Spain]].<ref name="SharerTraxler06p763"/> But Cort<U+00E9>s' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were instead harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cort<U+00E9>s decided to despatch Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and hundreds of allied Mexican warriors from Tlaxcala and Cholula;<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref> they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p763"/> Pedro de Alvarado was infamous for the [[The massacre in the Main Temple|massacre of Aztec nobles]] in Tenochtitlan and, according to Bartolom<U+00E9> de las Casas, he committed further atrocities in the conquest of the Maya kingdoms in Guatemala.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 763<U+2013>764.</ref> Some groups remained loyal to the Spanish once they had submitted to the conquest, such as the Tz'utijil and the K'iche' of [[Quetzaltenango]], and provided them with warriors to assist further conquest. Other groups soon rebelled however, and by 1526 numerous rebellions had engulfed the highlands.<ref>Carmack 2001a, pp. 39<U+2013>40.</ref>

===Subjugation of the K'iche'===

Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast unopposed until they reached the [[Samal<U+00E1> River]] in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' kingdom]], and a K'iche' army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K'iche'.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p764">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764.</ref> On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitl<U+00E1>n by his Mexican allies (modern [[San Francisco Zapotitl<U+00E1>n]]). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K'iche' archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace.<ref>Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 65. Gall 1967, pp. 40<U+2013>41.</ref> Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre mountains]] towards the K'iche' heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K'iche' warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K'iche', who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K'iche' and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764. Gall 1967, p. 41.</ref> Although the common view is that the K'iche' prince [[Tec<U+00FA>n Um<U+00E1>n|Tecun Uman]] died in the later battle near [[Olintepeque]], the Spanish accounts are clear that at least one and possibly two of the lords of Q'umarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango.<ref>Gall 1967, pp. 41<U+2013>42. D<U+00ED>az del Castillo 1632, 2005, p. 510.</ref> The death of Tecun Uman is said to have taken place in the battle of El Pinar,<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p9,30">Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 9, 30.</ref> and local tradition has his death taking place on the Llanos de Urbina (Plains of Urbina), upon the approach to Quetzaltenango near the modern village of [[Cantel, Guatemala|Cantel]].<ref>Cornejo Sam 2009, pp. 269<U+2013>270.</ref> Pedro de Alvarado, in his third letter to Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s, describes the death of one of the four lords of Q'umarkaj upon the approach to Quetzaltenango. The letter was dated 11 April 1524 and was written during his stay at Q'umarkaj.<ref name="RestallAsselbergs07p9,30"/> Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524,<ref name="Gall67p41">Gall 1967, p. 41.</ref> a K'iche' army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated; many K'iche' nobles were among the dead.<ref name="Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.764-765"/> Such were the numbers of K'iche' dead that Olintepeque was given the name ''Xequiquel'', roughly meaning "bathed in blood".<ref>Fuentes y Guzm<U+00E1>n 1882, p. 49.</ref> This battle exhausted the K'iche' militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q'umarkaj, which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K'iche' intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q'umarkaj with his army.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p765">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 765.</ref>

In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q'umarkaj at the invitation of the remaining lords of the K'iche' after their catastrophic defeat,<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764<U+2013>765.

Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764<U+2013>765.</ref> As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K'iche' warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers.<ref name="Recinos 1952, 1986, p.75">Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 75.</ref> At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city.<ref>Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 74<U+2013>5. Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764<U+2013>765.</ref> After the destruction of Q'umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance. Alvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p765"/>

===Kaqchikel alliance===
On 14 April 1524, soon after the defeat of the K'iche', the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox.<ref>Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 297. Guillem<U+00ED>n 1965, p. 9.</ref><ref group="nb">Recinos places all these dates 2 days earlier (e.g. the Spanish arrival at Iximche on 12 April rather than 14 April) based on vague dating in Spanish primary records. Schele and Fahsen calculated all dates on the more securely dated Kaqchikel annals, where equivalent dates are often given in both the Kaqchikel and Spanish calendars. The Schele and Fahsen dates are used in this section. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 386. n. 15.</ref> The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K'iche' resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz'utuhil kingdom.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p297">Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 297.</ref> The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitl<U+00E1>n, [[Escuintla]] and [[Cuscatl<U+00E1>n Department|Cuscatl<U+00E1>n]]. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July (''1 Q'at'' in the Kaqchikel calendar) Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala ("St. James of the Knights of Guatemala").<ref name="autogenerated297">Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 297. Recinos 1998, p. 101. Guillem<U+00ED>n 1965, p. 10.</ref> Iximche was called Guatemala by the Spanish, from the Nahuatl ''Quauhtemallan'' meaning "forested land". Since the Spanish conquistadors founded their first capital at Iximche, they took the name of the city used by their Nahuatl-speaking Mexican allies and applied it to the new Spanish city and, by extension, to the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|kingdom]]. From this comes the modern name of the country.<ref>Schelle & Mathews 1999, p. 292.</ref>

===Conquest of the Tz'utujil===
[[File:Lago de Atitl<U+00E1>n 2009.JPG|thumb|left|The Tz'utujil kingdom had its capital on the shore of Lake Atitl<U+00E1>n.|alt=View across hills to a broad lake bathed in a light mist. The mountainous lake shore curves from the left foreground backwards and to the right, with several volcanoes rising from the far shore, framed by a clear blue sky above.]]
The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p765"/> Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 765. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 82.</ref> When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p765"/> Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled.<ref name="Recinos86p82">Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 82.</ref> The causeway was too narrow for the horses, therefore the conquistadors dismounted and crossed to the island before the inhabitants could break the bridges.<ref>Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref> The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to safety on another island. The Spanish could not pursue the survivors further because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April.<ref name="Recinos86p83">Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 83.</ref>

The following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche.<ref name="Recinos86p83"/> Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 765<U+2013>766. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 84.</ref> A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]], whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.<ref name="Recinos86p84">Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 84.</ref>

Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p298">Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 298.</ref> He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 [[peso]]s.<ref name="Guillemin67p25">Guillemin 1967 p. 25.</ref><ref group="nb">A ''peso'' was a Spanish coin.

Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/> Two years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the ''[[Iximche#Political organisation|Ahpo Xahil]]'', sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado.<ref>Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 298, 310, 386n19.</ref><ref group="nb">Recinos 1998, p. 19. gives ''sixty'' deserters.</ref> Conquistador Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo recounted how in 1526 he returned to Iximche and spent the night in the "old city of Guatemala" together with Luis Mar<U+00ED>n and other members of Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s's expedition to Honduras.

The Spanish founded a new town at nearby [[Tecp<U+00E1>n Guatemala]]; ''Tecp<U+00E1>n'' is Nahuatl for "palace", thus the name of the new town translated as "the palace among the trees".<ref name="ScheleMathews99p299"/> The Spanish abandoned Tecp<U+00E1>n in 1527, because of the continuous Kaqchikel attacks, and moved to the Almolonga Valley to the east, refounding their capital on the site of today's [[San Miguel Escobar]] district of Ciudad Vieja, near [[Antigua Guatemala]].<ref>Lutz 1997, pp. 10, 258. Ortiz Flores 2008.</ref>

The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops,<ref>Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 92.</ref> the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/> A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/> The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecp<U+00E1>n, the rest to [[Solol<U+00E1>]] and other towns around Lake Atitl<U+00E1>n.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p299">Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 299.</ref>

===Siege of Zaculeu===
[[File:Zacuelu3A.jpg|thumb|right|Zaculeu fell to Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras after a siege of several months.|alt=A cluster of squat white step pyramids, the tallest of them topped by a shrine with three doorways. In the background is a low mountain ridge.]]
Although a state of hostilities existed between the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K'iche' allies prior to European contact, when the conquistadors arrived there was a shift in the political landscape. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king [[Kayb'il B'alam]] was received with great honour in Q'umarkaj while he was there.<ref>del <U+00C1>guila Flores 2007, p. 37.</ref> The expedition against [[Zaculeu]] was apparently initiated after K'iche' bitterness at their failure to contain the Spanish at Q'umarkaj, with the plan to trap the conquistadors in the city having been suggested to them by the Mam king, Kayb'il B'alam; the resulting execution of the K'iche' kings was viewed as unjust. The K'iche' suggestion of marching on the Mam was quickly taken up by the Spanish.<ref>Lovell 2005, p. 60.</ref>

At the time of the conquest, the main Mam population was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled ''Chinabjul''), now the city of [[Huehuetenango]], but Zaculeu's fortifications led to its use as a refuge during the conquest.<ref name="Recinos86p110">Recinos 1986, p. 110.</ref> The refuge was attacked by [[Gonzalo de Alvarado|Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras]], brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado,<ref>Gall 1967, p.39.</ref> in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry,<ref name="Lovell05p61">Lovell 2005, p. 61.</ref> and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies.<ref name="Carmack01p39">Carmack 2001a, p. 39.</ref> Gonzalo de Alvarado left the Spanish camp at Tecp<U+00E1>n Guatemala in July 1525 and marched to the town of [[Totonicap<U+00E1>n]], which he used as a supply base. From Totonicap<U+00E1>n the expedition headed north to [[Momostenango]], although it was delayed by heavy rains. Momostenango quickly fell to the Spanish after a four-hour battle. The following day Gonzalo de Alvarado marched on Huehuetenango and was confronted by a Mam army of 5,000 warriors from nearby Malacat<U+00E1>n (modern [[Malacatancito]]). The Mam army advanced across the plain in battle formation and was met by a Spanish cavalry charge that threw them into disarray, with the infantry mopping up those Mam that survived the cavalry. Gonzalo de Alvarado slew the Mam leader Canil Acab with his lance, at which point the Mam army's resistance was broken, and the surviving warriors fled to the hills. Alvarado entered Malacat<U+00E1>n unopposed to find it occupied only by the sick and the elderly. Messengers from the community's leaders arrived from the hills and offered their unconditional surrender, which was accepted by Alvarado. The Spanish army rested for a few days, then continued onwards to Huehuetenango only to find it deserted. Kayb'il B'alam had received news of the Spanish advance and had withdrawn to his fortress at Zaculeu.<ref name="Lovell05p61"/> Alvarado sent a message to Zaculeu proposing terms for the peaceful surrender of the Mam king, who chose not to answer.<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 61<U+2013>62.</ref>

Zaculeu was defended by Kayb'il B'alam<ref name="Recinos86p110"/> commanding some 6,000 warriors gathered from Huehuetenango, Zaculeu, [[Cuilco]] and [[Ixtahuac<U+00E1>n]]. The fortress was surrounded on three sides by deep ravines and defended by a formidable system of walls and ditches. Gonzalo de Alvarado, although outnumbered two to one, decided to launch an assault on the weaker northern entrance. Mam warriors initially held the northern approaches against the Spanish infantry but fell back before repeated cavalry charges. The Mam defence was reinforced by an estimated 2,000 warriors from within Zaculeu but was unable to push the Spanish back. Kayb'il B'alam, seeing that outright victory on an open battlefield was impossible, withdrew his army back within the safety of the walls. As Alvarado dug in and laid siege to the fortress, an army of approximately 8,000 Mam warriors descended on Zaculeu from the Cuchumatanes mountains to the north, drawn from those towns allied with the city.<ref name="Lovell05p62">Lovell 2005, p. 62.</ref> Alvarado left [[Antonio de Salazar (conquistador)|Antonio de Salazar]] to supervise the siege and marched north to confront the Mam army.<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 62, 64.</ref> The Mam army was disorganised, and although it was a match for the Spanish and allied foot soldiers, it was vulnerable to the repeated charges of the experienced Spanish cavalry.

===Conquest of the Poqomam===
{{Maya civilization}}
In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a small company to conquer [[Mixco Viejo]] (Chinautla Viejo), the capital of the Poqomam.<ref group="nb" name="MixcoViejo">The location of the historical city of Mixco Viejo has been the source of some confusion. The archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo has been proven to be Jilotepeque Viejo, the capital of the Chajoma. The Mixco Viejo of colonial records has now been associated with the archaeological site of Chinautla Viejo, much closer to modern Mixco. Carmack 2001a, pp. 151, 158.</ref> At the Spanish approach, the inhabitants remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for most of the day but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw.<ref name="Lehmann68p11-13">Lehmann 1968, pp. 11<U+2013>13.</ref> The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to come and go.<ref>Lehmann 1968, pp. 11<U+2013>13. Recinos, Adrian 1952, 1986, p. 108.</ref>

Armed with the knowledge gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of [[Mixco]].<ref name="Lehmann68p11-13"/>

===Resettlement of the Chajoma===
There are no direct sources describing the conquest of the Chajoma by the Spanish but it appears to have been a drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory.<ref name="Hill 1998, pp.253">Hill 1998, pp. 253.</ref> The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm<U+00E1>n in the 17th century, long after the event.<ref name="Hill 1996, p.85">Hill 1996, p. 85.</ref> After the conquest, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to [[San Pedro Sacatep<U+00E9>quez, Guatemala|San Pedro Sacatep<U+00E9>quez]], including some of the inhabitants of the archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo).<ref group="nb" name="MixcoViejo"/> The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to [[San Mart<U+00ED>n Jilotepeque]].<ref name="Hill 1998, pp.253" /> The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub'il, an unidentified site somewhere near the modern towns of [[San Juan Sacatep<U+00E9>quez]] and San Pedro Sacatep<U+00E9>quez.<ref>Carmack 2001a, pp. 155<U+2013>6.</ref>

In the colonial period, most of the surviving Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatep<U+00E9>quez, San Pedro Sacatep<U+00E9>quez and San Mart<U+00ED>n Jilotepeque as a result of the Spanish policy of ''congregaciones''; the people were moved to whichever of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns.<ref>Hill 1996, pp. 65, 67.</ref> After their relocation some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.<ref name="Hill 1996, p.85"/>

===Chiquimula===
Chiquimula de la Sierra ("Chiquimula in the Highlands"), occupying the area of the modern department of [[Chiquimula Department|Chiquimula]] to the east of the Poqomam and Chajoma, was inhabited by [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] Maya at the time of the conquest.<ref name="CastroRamos03p40">Castro Ramos 2003, p. 40</ref> The first Spanish reconnaissance of this region took place in 1524 by an expedition that included [[Hernando de Ch<U+00E1>vez]], [[Juan Dur<U+00E1>n]], [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Becerra]] and [[Crist<U+00F3>bal Salvatierra]], amongst others.<ref name="DaryFuentes08p59">Dary Fuentes 2008, p. 59.</ref> In 1526 three Spanish captains, [[Juan P<U+00E9>rez Dard<U+00F3>n]], [[Sancho de Barahona]] and Bartolom<U+00E9> Becerra, invaded Chiquimula on the orders of Pedro de Alvarado. The indigenous population soon rebelled against excessive Spanish demands, but the rebellion was quickly put down in April 1530.<ref>Putzeys and Flores 2007, p. 1475.</ref> However, the region was not considered fully conquered until a campaign by [[Jorge de Bocanegra]] in 1531<U+2013>1532 that also took in parts of [[Jalapa Department|Jalapa]].<ref name="DaryFuentes08p59"/> The afflictions of Old World diseases, war and overwork in the mines and ''[[encomienda]]s'' took a heavy toll on the inhabitants of eastern Guatemala, to the extent that indigenous population levels never recovered to their pre-conquest levels.<ref>Dary Fuentes 2008, p. 60.</ref>

===Campaigns in the Cuchumatanes===
[[File:Sierra de los Cuchumatanes01.jpg|thumb|right|The difficult terrain and remoteness of the Cuchumatanes made their conquest difficult.|alt=View over a heavily forested mountain slope towards rugged peaks beyond, separated from them by a mass of low cloud.]]
In the ten years after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]] and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the [[Chuj people|Chuj]] and [[Q'anjob'al people|Q'anjob'al]].<ref>Lim<U+00F3>n Aguirre 2008, p. 10.</ref> The Spanish were attracted to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the mountains but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult.<ref>Lim<U+00F3>n Aguirre 2008, p. 11.</ref> The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because of the effects of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.<ref name="Lovel05p71"/>

====Uspant<U+00E1>n and the Ixil====
After the western portion of the Cuchumatanes fell to the Spanish, the [[Ixil people|Ixil]] and [[Uspantek people|Uspantek]] Maya were sufficiently isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, four years after the conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and [[Uspant<U+00E1>n]] was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. [[Gaspar Arias]], [[alcalde|magistrate]] of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors.<ref name="Lovell05p64"/> By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of [[Chajul]] and [[Nebaj]].<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 64<U+2013>65.</ref> The Spanish army then marched east toward Uspant<U+00E1>n itself; Arias then received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, [[Francisco de Ordu<U+00F1>a]], had deposed him as magistrate. Arias handed command over to the inexperienced [[Pedro de Olmos]] and returned to confront de Ordu<U+00F1>a. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]] on the altar of their deity [[Maya Hero Twins|Exbalamquen]]. The survivors who managed to evade capture fought their way back to the Spanish garrison at Q'umarkaj.<ref name="Lovell05p65">Lovell 2005, p. 65.</ref>

A year later [[Francisco de Castellanos]] set out from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now relocated to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at [[Chichicastenango]] and recruited further forces before marching seven [[League (unit)|leagues]] northwards to [[Sacapulas]] and climbed the steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes they clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry managed to outflank the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold and set it on fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences.<ref name="Lovell05p65"/> The victorious Spanish rounded up the surviving defenders and the next day Castellanos ordered them all to be branded as [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slaves]] as punishment for their resistance.<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 65<U+2013>66.</ref> The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspant<U+00E1>n to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from [[Cotzal]], [[Cun<U+00E9>n]], Sacapulas and Verapaz. The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of Spanish cavalry and the firearms of the Spanish infantry eventually decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspant<U+00E1>n and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.<ref name="Lovell05p66">Lovell 2005, p. 66</ref>

====Reduction of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al====
In 1529 the Chuj city of [[San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n]] (then known by the name of ''Ystapalap<U+00E1>n'') was given in ''encomienda'' to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a companion of Pedro de Alvarado, together with [[Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango|Santa Eulalia]] and [[Jacaltenango]]. In 1549, the first reduction (''reducci<U+00F3>n'' in Spanish) of San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries,<ref name="San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n at Inforpressca">INFORPRESSCA 2011. MINEDUC 2001, pp. 14<U+2013>15. Lim<U+00F3>n Aguirre 2008, p. 10.</ref> in the same year the Q'anjob'al ''reducci<U+00F3>n'' settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al ''reducciones'' were in place at [[San Pedro Soloma]], [[San Juan Ixcoy]] and [[San Miguel Acat<U+00E1>n]] by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests from the Spanish ''reducciones''. In 1586 the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian]] Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia.<ref name="Hinz0810p36">Hinz 2008, 2010, p. 36.</ref> The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lacandon to the north. The continued resistance was so determined that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.<ref>Lim<U+00F3>n Aguirre 2008, pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref>

In the late 17th century, the Spanish missionary [[Friar|Fray]] Alonso de Le<U+00F3>n reported that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n did not pay tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the [[Roman Catholic]] mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of [[pre-Columbian]] temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de Le<U+00F3>n informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were [[Christian]] in name only. Eventually, Fray de Le<U+00F3>n was chased out of San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n by the locals.<ref name="Lovell 2000, pp.416-417">Lovell 2000, pp. 416<U+2013>417.</ref>

In 1684, a council led by [[Enrique Enriquez de Guzm<U+00E1>n]], the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregimiento]] of Huehuetenango.<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, pp. 149<U+2013>150.</ref>

On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodr<U+00ED>guez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself.<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, pp. xxxiii, 153<U+2013>154.</ref> It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the [[Lacandon Jungle|Lacandon region]], which included parts of what is now the Mexican [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of Chiapas and the western part of the Pet<U+00E9>n Basin.<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. 154.</ref> To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Crist<U+00F3>bal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango.<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, pp. 154<U+2013>155.</ref> The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n on 3 February, where Captain Rodr<U+00ED>guez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepci<U+00F3>n also remained in the town.<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p.156">Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. 156.</ref> Governor Enriquez de Guzm<U+00E1>n subsequently left San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n for Comit<U+00E1>n in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via [[Ocosingo]].<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, pp. 156, 160.</ref>

In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n, [[Cob<U+00E1>n]] and Ocosingo.<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xxxiii">Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xxxiii.</ref> Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat<U+00E1>n.<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p.xxxiv"/> Followed the same route used in 1686,<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xxxiii"/> they managed on the way to recruit 200&nbsp;indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solom<U+00E1> and San Mateo itself.<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p.xxxiv">Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xxxiv.</ref> On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle.<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p.xxxiv"/>

==Pacific lowlands: Pipil and Xinca==
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the western portion of the Pacific plain was dominated by the K'iche' and Kaqchikel states,<ref>Fox 1981, p. 321.</ref> while the eastern portion was occupied by the Pipil and the Xinca.<ref>Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 111.</ref> The Pipil inhabited the area of the modern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Escuintla Department|Escuintla]] and a part of [[Jutiapa Department|Jutiapa]];<ref>Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 113.</ref> the main Xinca territory lay to the east of the main Pipil population in what is now [[Santa Rosa Department, Guatemala|Santa Rosa department]];<ref>Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 114.</ref> there were also Xinca in Jutiapa.<ref name="CastroRamos03p40"/>

In the half century preceding the arrival of the Spanish, the Kaqchikel were frequently at war with the Pipil of Izcuintepeque (modern Escuintla).<ref>Fox 1981, p. 326.</ref> By March 1524 the K'iche had been defeated, followed by a Spanish alliance with the Kaqchikel in April of the same year.<ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/> On 8 May 1524, soon after his arrival in Iximche and immediately following his subsequent conquest of the Tz'utujil around Lake Atitl<U+00E1>n, Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain, where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque (called Panatacat in the ''Annals of the Kaqchikels'') near Izcuintepeque on 9 May.<ref>Fowler 1985, p. 41. Recinos 1998, p. 29.</ref> Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day. However, Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands.<ref name="PoloSifontes81p117"/> According to Alvarado's letter to Cort<U+00E9>s, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord.<ref>Batres 2009, p. 65.</ref> The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days.<ref name="PoloSifontes81p117">Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 117.</ref> A few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.<ref>Batres 2009, p. 66.</ref>

In [[Guazacap<U+00E1>n]], now a [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca.<ref name="Letona5">Letona Zuleta et al, p. 5.</ref> At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec.<ref name="Letona6">Letona Zuleta et al, p. 6.</ref> Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the [[Taxisco]] area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population.<ref name="Letona5"/>

After the conquest of the Pacific plain, the inhabitants paid tribute to the Spanish in the form of valuable products such as [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[cotton]], [[salt]] and [[vanilla]], with an emphasis on cacao.<ref>Batres 2009, p. 84.</ref>

==Northern lowlands==
The Contact Period in Guatemala's northern Pet<U+00E9>n lowlands lasted from 1525 through to 1700.<ref>Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5.</ref> Superior Spanish weaponry and the use of cavalry, although decisive in the northern Yucat<U+00E1>n, were ill-suited to warfare in the dense forests of lowland Guatemala.<ref name="Jones00p361"/>

In 1525, after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet<U+00E9>n Department of Guatemala.<ref name="Jones00p358">Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> His aim was to subdue the rebellious [[Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid]], whom he had sent to conquer Honduras, but Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him 600 [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] carriers from [[Acalan]]. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> on 13 March 1525.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p761762">Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 761<U+2013>762.</ref>

Cort<U+00E9>s accepted an invitation from Aj Kan Ek', the king of the Itza, to visit Nojpet<U+00E9>n (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> On his departure from Nojpet<U+00E9>n, Cort<U+00E9>s left behind a cross and a lame horse. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of [[Franciscan]] priests in 1618, when Cort<U+00E9>s' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Jones00p358"/> From the lake, Cort<U+00E9>s continued south along the western slopes of the [[Maya Mountains]], a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover {{convert|32|km|mi}}, during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cort<U+00E9>s turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762.</ref>

On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of [[Lake Izabal]], where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them out to safety.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762"/> Cort<U+00E9>s found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the [[Dulce River]] to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the [[Amatique Bay]],<ref name="Feldman98p6">Feldman 1998, p. 6.</ref> with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the course of the next week.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762"/> By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cort<U+00E9>s succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cort<U+00E9>s then returned to Mexico by sea.<ref>Webster 2002, p. 83.</ref>

By 1537 the area immediately north of the new colony of Guatemala was being referred to as the ''Tierra de Guerra'' ("Land of War").<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p.xvi">Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xvi.</ref><ref group="nb">The colony of Guatemala at this time consisted only of the highlands and Pacific plain.</ref> Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as ''Verapaz'' ("True Peace").<ref name="PonsSaez97pxvii">Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xvii.</ref> The Land of War described an area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement near the edge of the jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities, especially those ''congregaciones'' that were remote from centres of colonial authority.<ref name="PonsSaez97pxviii">Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xviii.</ref> The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to [[Nito]] on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from [[Rabinal]] and [[Salam<U+00E1>]],<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xix.</ref> and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands.<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, pp. 51<U+2013>52.</ref> It includes the modern departments of [[Baja Verapaz Department|Baja Verapaz]] and [[Alta Verapaz Department|Alta Verapaz]], [[Izabal Department|Izabal]] and Pet<U+00E9>n, as well as the eastern part of [[Quich<U+00E9> Department|El Quich<U+00E9>]] and a part of the Mexican state of Chiapas.<ref>ITMB Publishing 1998.</ref> The western portion of this area was the territory of the [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi' Maya]].<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 48.</ref>

Dominican friar [[Bartolom<U+00E9> de las Casas]] arrived in the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and immediately campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work.<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xx.</ref> Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith.<ref>Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p. xxi.</ref> It was the Dominicans who promoted the use of the name Verapaz instead of the Land of War.<ref name="PonsSaez97pxvii"/> Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, [[Alonso de Maldonado]], agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new ''encomiendas'' in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and [[Cob<U+00E1>n]], and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.{{rquote|left|one could make a whole book...out of the atrocities, barbarities, murders, clearances, ravages and other foul injustices perpetrated...by those that went to Guatemala|Bartolom<U+00E9> de las Casas<ref>De las Casas 1552, 1992, p. 54.</ref>}} In this way they congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal.<ref>Wagner snd Parish 1967, pp. 86-93.</ref> Las Casas became instrumental in the introduction of the [[New Laws]] in 1542, established by the Spanish Crown to control the excesses of the conquistadors and colonists against the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous inhabitants of the Americas]].<ref name="Pons S<U+00E1>ez 1997, p.xvi"/> As a result the Dominicans met substantial resistance from the Spanish colonists, who saw their own interests threatened by the New Laws; this distracted the Dominicans from their efforts to establish peaceful control over the Land of War.<ref name="PonsSaez97pxvii"/>

In 1543 the new colonial ''reducci<U+00F3>n'' of Santo Domingo de Cob<U+00E1>n was founded at Chi Mon'a to house the relocated Q'eqchi' from Chichen, Xucaneb and Al Run Tax Aj. Santo Tom<U+00E1>s Ap<U+00F3>stol was founded nearby the same year at Chi Nim Xol, it was used in 1560 as a ''reducci<U+00F3>n'' to resettle Ch'ol communities from Topiltepeque and Lacandon in the Usumacinta Valley.<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 52.

===Lake Izabal and the lower Motagua River===
The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.<ref name="Feldman98p7">Feldman 1998, p. 7.</ref>

In 1598 [[Alfonso Criado de Castilla]] became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of [[Puerto Cort<U+00E9>s|Puerto Caballos]] on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal.<ref name="Feldman98p7"/> As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named [[Santo Tom<U+00E1>s de Castilla]], at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the [[Motagua River|Motagua Valley]] into the highlands. Indigenous guides scouting the route from the highlands would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below [[Quirigu<U+00E1>]], because the area was inhabited by the hostile [[Toquegua]].<ref name="Feldman98p8">Feldman 1998, p. 8.</ref>

The leaders of Xocolo and Amatique, backed by the threat of Spanish action, persuaded a community of 190 Toquegua to settle on the Amatique coast in April 1604. The new settlement immediately suffered a drop in population, but although the Amatique Toquegua were reported extinct before 1613 in some sources, Mercedarian friars were still attending to them in 1625.<ref name="Feldman98p10"/> In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Francisco Mor<U+00E1>n as their ecclesiastical head. Mor<U+00E1>n favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.<ref name="Feldman00pxxii">Feldman 2000, p. xxii.</ref> By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua no longer existed as a separate people because of a combination of high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians.<ref name="Feldman98p10">Feldman 1998, p. 10.</ref> At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent (or "wild" from the Spanish point of view) Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal.<ref>Feldman 1998, pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref> The north shore of the lake, although fertile, was by then largely depopulated, therefore the Spanish planned to bring the Mopan out of the forests to the north into an area where they could be more easily controlled.<ref name="Feldman98p11">Feldman 1998, p. 11.</ref>

During the campaign to conquer the Itza of Pet<U+00E9>n, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled in the Colonial ''reducci<U+00F3>n'' of [[San Antonio de las Bodegas]] on the south shore of the lake and in [[San Pedro de Amatique]]. By the latter half of the 18th century the indigenous population of these towns had disappeared; the local inhabitants now consisted entirely of Spaniards, [[mulattos]] and others of mixed race, all associated with the [[Castillo de San Felipe]] fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal.<ref name="Feldman98p11"/> The main cause of the drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta was the constant slave raids by the [[Miskito Sambu]] of the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean coast]] that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the [[Crown colony|British colony]] of [[Jamaica]].<ref name="Feldman98p12">Feldman 1998, p. 12.</ref>

===Conquest of Pet<U+00E9>n===
[[File:Contact Period lowland Guatemala.gif|thumb|right|450px|Map of the northern Guatemalan lowlands at the time of Spanish contact|alt=Northern Guatemala is a flat lowland plain dropping off from the Cuchumatanes mountain range sweeping across in an arc to the south. To the east of the mountains is the large lowland Lake Izabal, with an outlet into the Amatique Bay to the east, which itself opens onto the Gulf of Honduras. Immediately north of the mountains is the Lacandon forest, with Pet<U+00E9>n to the northeast. Ystapalap<U+00E1>n was a settlement in the western Cuchumatanes, in the territory of the Chuj. Cob<U+00E1>n was in Q'eqchi' territory, in the foothills half way between Ystapalap<U+00E1>n in the west and Lake Izabal in the east. Xocolo was at the northeastern extreme of Lake Izabal, where it flows out towards the sea. Nito, also known as Amatique, was on the coast where the river flowing out of the lake opened into the Amatique Bay. The area south of the lake was Toquegua territory. The Manche occupied the lands to the northwest of the lake, with the Acala to their west between the Manche and the Chuj. The Lacandon were northwest of the Acala, straddling the border with Mexico. Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> was in the centre of Pet<U+00E9>n, to the north. It was the location of Nojpet<U+00E9>n, with the Itza lands stretching southwards from the lake. To the east of the Itza and northeast of the Manche were the Mopan, on the border with Belize. North of the Mopan were the Yalain, east of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. The Kowoj were to the northeast of the lake and the Kejache to the northwest. The "Tierra de Guerra" ("Land of War") covers a broad northern swathe of the mountains and the southern portion of the lowlands.]]
From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, establishing a number of colonies and towns by 1544, including [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] and [[Valladolid, Yucat<U+00E1>n|Valladolid]] in what is now Mexico.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 358<U+2013>360.</ref> The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, within the modern borders of Guatemala.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 360<U+2013>361.</ref> The Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the slow Spanish advance.<ref name="Jones00p361">Jones 2000, p. 361.</ref>

Dominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Pet<U+00E9>n from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the ''encomiendas''.<ref name="Jones00p361"/> Fray Bartolom<U+00E9> de Fuensalida visited Nojpet<U+00E9>n in 1618 and 1619.<ref>Rice and Rice 2009, p. 11.</ref> The Franciscan missionaries attempted to use their own reinterpretation of the ''[[k'atun]]'' prophecies when they visited Nojpet<U+00E9>n at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek' and his [[Maya priesthood]] that the time for conversion had come.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 361<U+2013>362.</ref> But the Itza priesthood interpreted the prophecies differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucat<U+00E1>n, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the [[Lacant<U+00FA>n River]] in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon. The Franciscan friar Andr<U+00E9>s de Avenda<U+00F1>o oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year [[Maya calendar|Maya calendrical cycle]] beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. However the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avenda<U+00F1>o was fortunate to escape with his life. The Itza's continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were dispatched from Campeche to take Nojpet<U+00E9>n once and for all.<ref name="Jones00p362">Jones 2000, p. 362.</ref>

====Fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n====
[[Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a]] arrived on the western shore of lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> with his soldiers in February 1697, and once there built a ''galeota'', a large and heavily armed oar-powered attack boat.<ref name="Jones09p59">Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> The Itza capital fell in a bloody waterborne assault on 13 March 1697.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 362. Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island; many Itza Maya who fled to swim across the lake were killed in the water.<ref name="Jones09p59"/> After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town.<ref name="Jones00p362"/> The Itza and Kowoj kings (Ajaw Kan Ek' and Aj Kowoj) were soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With Nojpet<U+00E9>n safely in the hands of the Spanish, Urs<U+00FA>a returned to Campeche; he left a small garrison on the island, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. Nojpet<U+00E9>n was renamed by the Spanish as ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza'' ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ''[[ladino people|ladino]]'' civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to the colonial capital; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the capital.<ref name="Jones09p59"/>

===Final years of conquest===
In the late 17th century the small population of Ch'ol Maya in southern Pet<U+00E9>n and [[Belize]] was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] in the early 18th century.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 365.</ref> Catholic priests from Yucat<U+00E1>n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> in 1702<U+2013>1703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet<U+00E9>n, compared to ten times that number in 1697.<ref name="Jones09p59"/> Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.<ref>Jones 2009, p. 60.</ref>

==Legacy of the Spanish conquest==
The initial shock of the Spanish conquest was followed by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish ''reducciones'' created new nucleated settlements laid out in a grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ''[[ayuntamiento]]''. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the ''ladinos'') or was tightly controlled by them.<ref name="Coe99p231">Coe 1999, p. 231.</ref> The introduction of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious [[syncretism]].<ref>Coe 1999, pp. 231<U+2013>232.</ref> Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the [[marimba]], a musical instrument of African origin.<ref name="Coe99p233">Coe 1999, p. 233.</ref> The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace [[Neolithic]] tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of [[Game (food)|game]]. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and [[Coffee production in Guatemala|coffee]] led to plantations that economically exploited native labour.<ref name="Coe99p232">Coe 1999, p. 232.</ref> Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and [[hispanicization]].<ref name="Coe99p233"/> Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya [[peasant]]s and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race Ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 60.</ref> Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.<ref>Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 104.</ref>
