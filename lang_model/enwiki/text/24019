'''Monmouthshire''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|m|<U+0252>|n|m|<U+0259>|<U+03B8>|<U+0283>|<U+0259>r}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|m|<U+0252>|n|m|<U+0259>|<U+03B8>|<U+0283>|<U+026A><U+0259>r}}), also known as the '''County of Monmouth''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|m|<U+0252>|n|m|<U+0259>|<U+03B8>}}; {{lang-cy|Sir Fynwy}}), is one of thirteen [[Historic counties of Wales|ancient counties]] of [[Wales]] and a former [[Administrative divisions of Wales|administrative county]].

It corresponds approximately to the present [[principal areas of Wales|principal areas]] of [[Monmouthshire]], [[Blaenau Gwent]], [[Torfaen]], and [[Newport]] and those parts of [[Caerphilly (county borough)|Caerphilly]] and [[Cardiff]] east of the [[Rhymney River]].
 
The eastern part of the county is mainly agricultural, while the western valleys had rich mineral resources. This led to the area becoming highly industrialised with [[coal mining]] and iron working being major employers from the 18th century<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=17183 |title=Monmouthshire |accessdate=2008-08-24 |author=John Bartholomew |year=1887 |work=Gazetteer of the British Isles |publisher=Vision of Britain}}</ref> to the late 20th century.

Monmouthshire's Welsh status was ambiguous between the 16th and 20th centuries, with it considered by some to be part of [[England]] during this time.

==History==
===Formation===
The "county or shire of Monmouth" was formed from parts of the [[Welsh Marches]] by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]]. According to the Act the shire consisted of all ''Honours, Lordships, Castles, Manors, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, lying or being within the Compass or Precinct'' of the following ''Lordships, Townships, Parishes, Commotes and Cantrefs... in the Country of Wales'':

[[Monmouth]] <U+2022> [[Chepstow]] <U+2022> ''Matherne'' ([[Mathern]]) <U+2022> ''Llanvihangel'' ([[Rogiet#Llanfihangel Rogiet|Llanfihangel Rogiet]]) <U+2022> ''Magour'' ([[Magor, Monmouthshire|Magor]])  <U+2022> ''Goldcliffe'' ([[Goldcliff]])  <U+2022> [[Newport]] <U+2022> [[Wentloog]]e <U+2022> ''Llanwerne'' ([[Llanwern]]) <U+2022> ''Caerlion'' ([[Caerleon]]) <U+2022> [[Usk]] <U+2022> ''Treleck'' ([[Trellech]]) <U+2022> [[Tintern]] <U+2022> [[Skenfrith]] <U+2022> [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] <U+2022> ''Witecastle'' ([[White Castle (Wales)|White Castle]]) <U+2022> [[Raglan, Monmouthshire|Raglan]] <U+2022> ''Calicote'' ([[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]]) <U+2022> ''Biston'' ([[Bishton]]) <U+2022> [[Abergavenny]] <U+2022> ''Penrose'' ([[Penrhos, Monmouthshire|Penrhos]]) <U+2022> ''Grenefield'' ([[Maesglas]]) <U+2022> ''Maghen'' ([[Machen]]) <U+2022> ''Hochuyslade'' (possessions of [[Llanthony Priory]])<ref>Ivor Waters, ''Chepstow Packets'', 1983, ISBN 0-906134-21-8, p.34</ref>

The Act also designated Monmouth as the "Head and Shire town of the said county or shire of Monmouth", and ordered that the [[High Sheriff of Monmouthshire|Sheriff]]'s county or shire court be held alternately in Monmouth and Newport.<ref>Section 3 of the Laws in Wales Act 1535 (Hen. VIII c.26)</ref>

===Historic boundaries and subdivisions===
[[Image:Monmouthshire Hundreds.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of the hundreds of Monmouthshire by [[Thomas Moule]], c. 1831]]
The historic boundaries are the [[River Wye]] on the east, dividing it from [[Gloucestershire]] and the [[Rhymney River]] to the west dividing it from [[Glamorgan]]shire, with the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south. The boundaries with [[Herefordshire]] to the northeast and [[Brecknockshire]] to the north were less well-defined. The parish of [[Welsh Bicknor]], was an [[exclave]] of Monmouthshire, sandwiched between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The area was considered part of Monmouthshire until it was made part of Herefordshire "for all purposes" by the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]], while the Herefordshire hamlet of [[Cwmyoy#The parish|Fwthog]] adjoining the [[Vale of Ewyas|Honddu Valley]] remained an exclave within Monmouthshire until 1891.<ref>F. A. Youngs Jr., ''Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.II: Northern England'', London, 1991</ref>

The county was divided into six [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] in 1542:
[[Abergavenny (hundred)|Abergavenny]] <U+2022> [[Caldicot (hundred)|Caldicot]] <U+2022> [[Raglan (hundred)|Raglan]] <U+2022> [[Skenfrith (hundred)|Skenfrith]] <U+2022> [[Usk (hundred)|Usk]] <U+2022> [[Wentloog (hundred)|Wentloog]]

The county contained the three [[borough]]s of Monmouth, Newport and Usk.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51157&strquery=Monmouthshire#s9 Samuel Lewis (ed.), ''Monmouthshire'', in ''A Topographical Dictionary of England'', 1848, British History Online, accessed May 2, 2008]</ref>

===Municipal reform===
Monmouth and Newport were reformed as [[municipal borough]]s with elected town councils by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. Usk continued as an [[Unreformed boroughs in England and Wales 1835 - 1886|unreformed borough]] until its final abolition in 1886.

New forms of local government were established in the urban areas of the county with the setting of [[local board of health|local boards]] under the Public Health Act 1848 and Local Government Act 1858. The [[Public Health Act 1875]] divided the rural areas into [[sanitary district|rural sanitary districts]].

An [[administrative county]] of Monmouthshire, governed by an elected [[county council]], was formed in 1889 under the terms of the [[Local Government Act 1888]].  The administrative county had similar boundaries, but included the [[Beaufort, Ebbw Vale|Beaufort]], [[Dukestown]], [[Llechryd]] and [[Rassau]] areas of south [[Brecknockshire|Breconshire]].  <!-- these must have been in the geographic county, too -->  The county council was based in Newport, rather than the historic [[county town]] of Monmouth. In 1891 the borough of Newport achieved [[county borough]] status and therefore left the administrative county, although the [[Shire Hall, Newport|Shire Hall]] continued to be based there. In the same year the parish of Fwthog was transferred to both the administrative and geographic county of Monmouthshire.

Under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] Monmouthshire was divided into [[urban district|urban]] and [[rural district]]s, based on existing [[sanitary district]]s.

|}

In 1899 Abergavenny was incorporated as a borough. Two further urban districts were formed, [[Mynyddislwyn]] in 1903, and [[Bedwas and Machen]] in 1912. [[Local Government Act 1929|The County of Monmouth Review Order 1935]] revised the number and boundaries of the urban and rural districts in the administrative county. A new [[Cwmbran]] urban district was formed by the abolition of Llanfrechfa Upper and Llantarnam UDs, Abersychan and Panteg UDs were absorbed by Pontypool urban district, and [[Magor and St Mellons Rural District|Magor and St Mellons RD]] was formed by a merger of two rural districts.

The last major boundary change to affect the administrative and geographic county was in 1938 when the parish of [[Rumney, Cardiff|Rumney]] was removed to be included in the county borough of [[Cardiff]], and therefore the geographic county of Glamorgan.

===Abolition===
The administrative county of Monmouthshire and county borough of Newport were abolished in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Most of the area formed the new county of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]], with parts going to the new [[Rhymney Valley (district)|Rhymney Valley]] district of [[Mid Glamorgan]] and [[Cardiff (district)|Cardiff]] district of [[South Glamorgan]].  Successor districts of Gwent were Blaenau Gwent, [[Islwyn]], [[Monmouth (district)|Monmouth]], [[Newport (district)|Newport]] and [[Torfaen]].

==Legacy==
The name "Monmouthshire" was revived for one of the [[principal areas of Wales|principal areas]] created on further [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994|local government reorganisation in 1996]]. The principal area covers only part of the historic county, which also includes the principal areas of [[Newport]], [[Torfaen]], most of [[Blaenau Gwent]], and parts of [[Caerphilly (county borough)|Caerphilly]] and [[Cardiff]]. 

The [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]], which still exists for some ceremonial purposes, is similar in extent to historic Monmouthshire with the addition of the [[Rhymney Valley]] area.

==Ambiguity over Welsh status==

Monmouthshire's Welsh status was ambiguous between the 16th and 20th centuries, with it considered by some as part of [[England]]. 

===Background===
Between about the 5th and 10th centuries the Welsh [[Kingdom of Gwent]] covered a broadly similar but variable area.  It then became part of [[Glywysing|Morgannwg]], and shortly before the [[Norman conquest]] had become part of a unified kingdom of [[History of Wales|Wales]] under [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]].  At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] in 1086 the Chepstow and Monmouth areas were, for accounting purposes, reckoned as parts of the English counties of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7577077 |title=Folio 162r Great Domesday Book |accessdate=2008-08-05 |author= |year=1086 |work=Documents Online |publisher=The National Archives}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7577918 |title=Folio 180v Great Domesday Book |accessdate=2008-08-05 |author= |year=1086 |work=Documents Online |publisher=The National Archives}}</ref> These areas, along with the rest of what would later become Monmouthshire, were subsequently included in a substantial swathe of land from [[Pembrokeshire]] through south Wales to the [[Welsh Borders]] which was largely in the hands of the [[Marcher Lords]]. These men were appointed by the English king, but their lands were not subject to English law.  While the [[Principality of Wales]] was made part of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]], enacted on 3 March 1284, the administration of the Marcher lands was unchanged.<ref>R. R. Davies, ''Conquest, Coexistence and Change: Wales 1063-1415'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), ch. 14.</ref>  From the 11th until the 16th centuries, the area which later became Monmouthshire (subject to some boundary revisions) comprised six Marcher lordships - [[Abergavenny]], [[Caerleon]], [[Chepstow]] (or [[Striguil]]), [[Gwynllwg]] (Wentloog), Monmouth and [[Usk]].<ref name=Davies>[[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], ''A History of Wales'', 1993, ISBN 0-140-28475-3</ref>

===The 16th to 19th centuries===
The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]] integrated Wales directly into the English legal system and the ''"Lordships Marchers within the said Country or Dominion of Wales"'' were allocated to existing and new shires. Some lordships were annexed to existing counties in England and some were annexed to existing counties in Wales, with the remainder being divided up into new counties, one of which was Monmouthshire. 

Although the original Act of 1535 specifically includes Monmouthshire as being in the 'Country or Dominion of Wales' the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Act 1542]] enumerates the Welsh counties as twelve in number, excluding Monmouthshire from the count. Neither Act refers to Monmouthshire as being an English county; indeed, no Act of Parliament states that Monmouthshire has been removed from Wales and added to England.  However, Monmouthshire was made directly responsible to the courts of Westminster rather than falling under the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales]].  According to historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], this arrangement was the cause of the erroneous belief that the county had been annexed by England rather than remaining part of Wales. He also says ''"Monmouthshire was no less Welsh in language and sentiment than any other eastern county"''.<ref name=Davies/>  

Despite Monmouthshire being a new county, it was given two [[Knights of the Shire]] in common with existing counties in England, rather than one as in the counties in Wales. The relevant section of the Act states that ''"one Knight shall be chosen and elected to the same Parliaments for every of the Shires of [[Brecknockshire|Brecknock]], [[Radnorshire|Radnor]], [[Montgomeryshire|Montgomery]] and [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbigh]], and for every other Shire within the said Country of Dominion of Wales"''. However, it was given only one Borough member, like the other Welsh counties (apart from Pembrokeshire which had two Borough members and Merioneth which had none).  In ecclesiastical terms, most of the county outside the town of Monmouth itself remained within the [[Diocese of Llandaff]]; the town of Monmouth was in the diocese of Hereford, while the parishes of Cwmyoy and Llanthony were in the diocese of St David's. <ref name=eb1911>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Monmouthshire  Monmouthshire in 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica]</ref>   In 1549 [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] granted a Charter to Monmouth which was described as being "in the [[Welsh Marches|Marches of Wales]]".  Later writers who described Monmouthshire as being in Wales included [[Humphrey Llwyd]] (''History of Cambria'', 1568); [[Thomas Churchyard]] (''Worthiness of Wales'', 1587); and [[Michael Drayton]] (''[[Poly-Olbion]]'', 1613).<ref>[http://www.royalforestofdean.info/monmouthshire/monmouth.shtml  Monmouth Tourist Information]</ref>  

However, in the late 17th century under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] it was added to the Oxford circuit of the [[Assize Court#England and Wales|English Assizes]] following which, according to the [[1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]], it gradually ''"came to be regarded as an English county"''.<ref name=eb1911/> The ''Modern Universal British Traveller'' of 1779 stated: ''"Monmouthshire was formerly a part of Wales, and continued so till the reign of Charles II, when it was reckoned an English county (as it has been ever since) because the judges then began to keep the assizes here in the Oxford circuit."''<ref>Charles Burlington et al., ''The Modern Universal British Traveller'', 1779, quoted in Keith Kissack, ''Monmouth and its Buildings'', 2003, ISBN 1-904396-01-1, p.3</ref>   A later traveller, [[George Borrow]] in 1862, wrote: ''"Monmouthshire is at present considered an English county, though certainly with little reason, for it not only stands on the western side of the Wye, but the names of almost all its parishes are Welsh, and many thousands of its population still speak the Welsh language."''<ref>George Borrow, ''[[Wild Wales]]'', first published 1862, reprint 1998, ISBN 1-871083-26-5, p.519</ref>

Although Wales was legally integrated into England, the word "England" was still taken to exclude Wales in many contexts. The [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] ensured that ''"in all Cases where the Kingdom of England, or that Part of Great Britain called England, hath been or shall be mentioned in any Act of Parliament, the same has been and shall from henceforth be deemed and taken to comprehend and include the Dominion of Wales and Town of [[Berwick upon Tweed]]"''.

==="Wales and Monmouthshire"===
The 1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica unambiguously described the county as part of England, but notes that ''"whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire"''.  However, most Acts of Parliament listed Monmouthshire as part of England, for example the [[Local Government Act 1933]] listed both the administrative county of Monmouth and county borough of Newport as part of England, but in the rare event that an [[Act of Parliament]] was restricted to Wales, Monmouthshire was usually included as "Wales and Monmouthshire". For example, although the [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881]] did not apply to Monmouthshire, the creation of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1965 and the [[Welsh Language Act 1967]] did (although the latter had the paradoxical effect of reinforcing the legal connection of Monmouthshire with England: see next section.) Both the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889, and the Welsh Cemeteries Act 1908, also applied to Monmouthshire.<ref name=visitnewportcity>[http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:n3b_th28QOgJ:www.visitnewportcity.co.uk/history_of_monmouthshire.asp+%22Welsh+Intermediate+Education+Act%22+Monmouthshire&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=10&gl=uk&client=firefox-a  Welcome to Monmouthshire - "interesting points"]</ref> The Sunday Closing Act was also extended to Monmouthshire in 1915 under wartime legislation. In considering the Sunday Closing Act in 1921, Monmouthshire County Council resolved, with only one vote against, to request that the county should be included in Wales for all legislative purposes.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1921/aug/12/licensing-no-2-bill  Hansard record of House of Lords debate on Sunday Closing Act, 1921]</ref>  Another typical example was the division of England and Wales into [[registration area]]s in the 19th century &mdash; one of which, the "Welsh Division", was defined as including "Monmouthshire, [[South Wales]] and [[North Wales]]".

This had been the case since the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543 which had extended the English system of justice, government and parliamentary representation to the principality of Wales and the March.  From the mid-sixteenth century to the early nineteenth century it had not been a matter of very much importance as to whether an England/Wales border could be identified and, if so, where it ran in respect of Monmouthshire.  That situation changed in the nineteenth century, as the particular cultural, linguistic and political characteristics of Welsh society emerged as both a problem (for the British state) and as a cause (particularly among Welsh Liberals and nonconformists).  Once specific policies (be they considered corrective or emancipating) began to be designed for application to Wales, then the question of Monmouthshire's placement became important."</blockquote> 

It has been suggested that the question of the status of Monmouthshire arose in earnest in the 19th century, when some of the local gentry such as the [[Duke of Beaufort (England)|Dukes of Beaufort]] established family seats in England, and many industrialists and others moved into Monmouthshire, particularly in the eastern part of the county.  Some of these, and others with "social aspirations", considered it essential to emphasise their "Englishness", and there were attempts to refine the notion that anomalies in the 16th century legislation had made the county non-Welsh. The distinction implied in the description "Wales and Monmouthshire" was nurtured by elements of the establishment, and became increasingly accepted on the English side of the border and in central government, until the local Welsh residents more fully asserted themselves in the 20th century.<ref name=visitnewportcity/>

===Twentieth century debate===
Following the [[Welsh Church Act 1914]], the [[Church in Wales]] was set up in 1920, containing within it the Diocese of Llandaff which included almost all of Monmouthshire.  The new [[Diocese of Monmouth]] was formed in 1921. In [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] terms, the area thus came to be treated as part of Wales.

The question of Monmouthshire's status continued to be a matter of discussion, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century. This sometimes led to heated debates in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]. In 1921 the [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Earl of Plymouth]] objected strongly to the inclusion of the county in legislation forcing the closing of [[public house]]s in Wales on Sundays. ''"I stand as strongly as I can for the privileges of Monmouthshire, to say it is a county of England."'' He went on to  complain that Welsh representatives were imposing the ban ''"against the will of the people of Monmouthshire"''.<ref>Lords Hansard, 12 August 1921, col. 524</ref> During a debate on the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in 1938, [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] objected to the stipulation that the chairman of the Monmouthshire [[quarter sessions]] should be a Welsh-speaker. Raglan stated that ''"The County of Monmouth is an English county. I do not think that will be disputed.."'' and he claimed that Welsh Nationalists had attempted to convince the [[Lord Chief Justice]] to move Monmouthshire from the Oxford Circuit to the South Wales Circuit, thereby making it part of Wales in matters of court administration. He alleged that these ''"persons unconnected with Monmouthshire"'' had claimed incorrectly that the inhabitants of the county ''"spoke nothing but Welsh"''.<ref>Lords Hansard, July 25, 1938, col. 1105</ref> 

In 1949, Monmouthshire was included within the remit of the [[Council for Wales and Monmouthshire]], an appointed body established by the Government to advise on Welsh affairs and a precursor of the Welsh Office.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1949/apr/26/council-for-wales-membership  Statement by Clement Attlee on the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire]</ref> 

The [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Abertillery (UK Parliament constituency)|Abertillery]], [[Llywelyn Williams]], campaigned to have Monmouthshire unambiguously placed in Wales. Speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in February 1957 he said ''"I think that it is about time we dropped this Wales and Monmouthshire business. Apart from a few cranks who search the files of the distant past for some very flimsy tokens of evidence to suggest that Monmouthshire belongs to England, no person acquainted with the county <U+2014> its history, customs, place names, culture and way of life <U+2014> would dream of regarding Monmouthshire people as anything but Welsh."''<ref>House of Commons Hansard, February 11, 1957, col.931</ref> Later in the year he asked [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]], [[Minister of Housing and Local Government and Welsh Affairs]], ''"whether he will now remove from official documents and records relating to Wales the additional words 'and Monmouthshire', since Monmouthshire is included in the term Wales."''. Brooke replied in the negative, as he did not think ''"such a course would be consistent with various statutory provisions relating to Monmouthshire."''<ref>House of Commons Hansard, July 26, 1957, col. 94</ref>

The [[Local Government Commission for Wales]] established in [[Local Government Act 1958|1958]] included Monmouthshire within its review area, and in 1961 proposed merging the area into a new "South East Wales" county.<ref>''Plan to Merge Welsh Counties Into Five Areas''. The Times. May 25, 1961</ref> The proposed inclusion of Monmouthshire in Wales infuriated Lord Raglan, by now [[Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire|Lord Lieutenant]] of the county.<ref>''Faithful to Both'', The Times, March 15, 1961, p.15</ref> In reaction, a "Make Monmouthshire Welsh" campaign was launched in August 1961 to gain parliamentary recognition that the county was in Wales.<ref>''"Monmouthshire is Welsh" Campaign'', The Times, August 5, 1961, p.8</ref> In November 1961 it was announced that a branch of the [[Royal Society of St George]] was to be formed, emphasising the county's English identity.<ref>''New Minister Faces Old Problem: Whose county is Monmouthshire?'', The Times, November 14, 1961, p.14</ref> Two years later Monmouth Borough Council made representations to the Minister of Housing and Local Government seeking the transfer of the town to Herefordshire in the event that the reforms were carried out. Signs erected by Monmouthshire County Council welcoming motorists to Wales were defaced or removed.<ref name="timesjun63">''Borough Wants to Keep Its Status: Monmouth Glance at Next County'', The Times, June 3, 1963, p.11</ref>  The County Council placed a revised sign at Monmouth stating "Welcome to Wales and Monmouthshire"; first, the words "..and Monmouthshire" were painted over, and then the words "..to Wales" were also obliterated.<ref>Ivor Waters, ''Chepstow Packets'', 1983, p.41</ref>

The [[Welsh Office]], established in 1965, included Monmouthshire within its remit.  The Wales and Berwick Act was repealed in regard to Wales in 1967 by the [[Welsh Language Act 1967]], which however also continued to use the phrase "Wales and Monmouthshire".  The [[Interpretation Act 1978]] hence provides that in legislation passed between 1967 and 1974, "a reference to England includes Berwick upon Tweed and Monmouthshire".

===Clarification of position in Wales===

In 1969 [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]] proposed to fully incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales. [[FitzRoy Somerset, 5th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] (son of the former lord lieutenant), asked the following question in the [[House of Lords]]: ''"To ask Her Majesty's Government why they propose to incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales without consulting Monmouthshire's inhabitants."'' Replying for the government, [[Norah Phillips, Baroness Phillips|Baroness Phillips]] stated that ''"The purpose of the change is to remove the anomaly arising from the present need to refer to Monmouthshire separately from Wales in Statutes. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State believes that the proposal commands wide support in the county."''<ref>Lords Hansard, January 22, 1969, Col. 924 - 925</ref> In April of the following year [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Gwynfor Evans]] asked Thomas ''"when he proposes to implement his undertaking that the phrase 'Wales and Monmouthshire' " will be dropped."'' The Secretary of State indicated that it would be after the passing of legislation to reform local government in Wales.<ref>Hansard, April 28, 1970, col. 308</ref>

The issue was finally clarified in law by the [[Local Government Act 1972]], which provided that ''"in every act passed on or after 1 April  1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) "Wales", subject to any alterations of boundaries..."'' included ''"the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of [[Newport]]"''.<ref>Local government Act 1972 (c.70), sections 1, 20 and 269</ref>

===Events since 1974===

The [[English Democrats Party]] nominated candidates for the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|2007 Welsh Assembly elections]] in the South East Wales region, and three of six constituencies in the area of the historic county with a view to promoting a [[referendum]] on 'Letting Monmouthshire Decide' whether it wished to be part of Wales or England.<ref>[http://www.Lettingmonmouthshiredecide.com English Democrats Monmouthshire Referendum Website]</ref> The party received 0.9% of the vote on the regional list, and between 2.2% and 2.7% of the vote in the constituencies and failed to have any members elected.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/vote2007/welshasssembly_english/html/region_99999.stm Welsh assembly election 2007 (BBC News)]</ref>

The Monmouthshire Association, a local society which promotes the county's identity, led a successful campaign to register a [[Flag of Monmouthshire]] with the [[Flag Institute]] in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcounties.co.uk/news/135-monmouthshire-flag-registered|title=Monmouthshire Flag Registered|publisher=[[Association of British Counties]]|date=30 September 2011}}</ref>
