[[Colonel]] '''Reginald Edward Harry Dyer''' [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]] (9 October 1864 <U+2013> 23 July 1927) was a [[British Indian Army]] officer who as a temporary [[Brigadier-General]] was responsible for the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in [[Amritsar]] (in the [[British India]] province of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]). Dyer was removed from duty but he became a celebrated hero in Britain among people with connections to the [[British Raj]].<ref>Derek Sayer, "British Reaction to the Amritsar Massacre 1919-1920," ''Past & Present,'' May 1991, Issue 131, pp 130-164

Dyer was born in [[Murree]], in the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab province]] of [[British India]], which is now in [[Pakistan]]. He was the son of an Irish brewer who managed the famed [[Murree Brewery]].  <ref>Oxford History of the British Empire Companion Series Ireland and the British Empire Kenny, Kevin 2004 Oxford University Press page 90</ref>  He spent his childhood in [[Shimla|Simla]] and received his early education at the [[Bishop Cotton School (Shimla)|Bishop Cotton School]] in [[Shimla|Simla]]. He attended [[Midleton]] College, [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]] between 1875 and 1881. In 1885, soon after attendance at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] he was commissioned into the [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)]] as a [[Lieutenant]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25506|startpage=4082|date=28 August 1885|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> and performed [[riot control]] duties in [[Belfast]] (1886) and served in the [[Third Burmese War]] (1886<U+2013>87). He was then transferred to the [[British Indian Army]], joining initially the [[Bengal Staff Corps]] as a Lieutenant in 1887<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25766|startpage=6940|date=13 December 1887|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25883|startpage=7141|date=14 December 1888|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> and being attached to the 39th Bengal Infantry, later transferring to the [[29th Punjabis]].

==Background==
The [[Europe]]an population in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] during 1919 feared the Indians would overthrow British rule. A nationwide [[hartal]] (strike action) which was called for on March 30 (later changed to April 6) by [[Gandhi]], had turned violent in some areas. Authorities were also becoming concerned by displays of Hindu-Muslim unity.<ref>Chadha, Yogesh (1997). ''Gandhi: A Life'' John Wiley & Sons Inc. p. 237. ISBN 0-471-35062-1</ref> Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]], the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, decided to deport major [[agitator]]s from the province. One person who was targeted was Dr. Satyapal,<ref>Chadha, ''ibid'', p. 237</ref> a Hindu who had served with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] during [[World War I]]. He advocated non-violent [[civil disobedience]] and was forbidden by the authorities from speaking publicly. Another person was Dr. [[Saifuddin Kitchlew]],<ref>Chadha, ''ibid'', p. 237</ref> a Muslim barrister who wanted political change and also preached [[non-violence]]. The district magistrate, acting on orders from the Punjab government, had the two leaders arrested.<ref>Chadha, ''Gandhi: A Life'', p. 237</ref> On 9 April 1919, crowds soon gathered at a bridge leading into the Civil Lines, where the British lived, demanding a release of the two men. Unable to hold the crowd back, troops panicked and began firing, causing several deaths of protesters. 

The shooting of protesters resulted in a mob which returned to the city centre, setting fire to government buildings and attacking Europeans in the city. Three British bank employees were beaten to death, and Miss Marcella Sherwood, who supervised the Mission Day School for Girls was cycling round the city to close her schools when she was assaulted by a mob in a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan.  Sherwood was rescued from the mob by local Indians.<ref>Chadha,  ''Gandhi: A Life'' pp. 237-9</ref> They hid the teacher, who was hurt in the beating, before moving her to the fort. This attack, and others against Europeans, angered Dyer who was the commandant of the infantry brigade in [[Jalandhar]]. He arrived on 11 April to assume command, then instructed the troops of the garrison regarding reprisals against the population.

As per regimental diaries kept by the Gorkha Battalion adjutants in the [[British Indian Army]], the plan to attack the gathering in Amritsar was claimed to have been triggered by this news of a mob attack on a British school teacher Sherwood, was later shown to be merely an excuse used by an incensed Dyer who commanded a brigade in nearby Jalandhar and the Lt Governor of Punjab [[Michael O'Dwyer]] who were convinced that they faced an imminent threat of mutiny in Punjab on the scale of [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857]].<ref name=ColonelAthaleDiaries>{{cite web|last=Athale|first=Rtd.

==Amritsar massacre==
{{See|Jallianwala Bagh massacre}}
Brigadier Dyer is known best for the orders which he gave on 13 April 1919 in [[Amritsar]]. It was by his command that 50 troops, including 25 [[Gurkhas]] of 1st/[[9th Gurkha Rifles]], 25 [[Pathans]] and [[Baluch people|Baluch]] of [[54th Sikhs]] and [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sindh Rifles]], all armed with [[Lee-Enfield|.303]] [[Lee-Enfield]] rifles opened fire on a gathering of unarmed civilians, including women and children, gathered at the Jallianwalla Bagh in what came to be known later as the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar massacre]].

The civilians had assembled at Jallianwala Bagh to participate with the annual [[Baisakhi]] celebrations which are both a religious and a cultural festival of the Punjabis. Being from outside the city, they may have been unaware of the martial law that had been imposed. The Bagh-space comprised 6 to {{convert|7|acre|m2}} and was walled on all sides except for five entrances. Four of these entrances were very narrow, admitting only a few people at a time. The fifth entrance was blocked by the armed soldiers, as well as by two armoured cars armed with machine guns. (These vehicles were unable to pass through the entrance.) Upon entering the park, the General ordered the troops to shoot directly into the assembled gathering. Shooting continued until his troops' supply of 1,650 rounds of ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref name=CommissionersI_II_56>''Report of Commissioners,'' Vol I, II, Bombay, 1920, Reprint New Delhi, 1976, p 56.</ref> The shooting continued unabated for about 10 minutes.<ref>''Disorder Inquiry Committee Report,'' Vol II, p 191.</ref>

From time to time, Dyer "checked his fire and directed it upon places where the crowd was thickest";<ref name=CommissionersI_II_56/> he did this not because the crowd was slow to disperse, but because he (the General) "had made up his mind to punish them for having assembled there."<ref name=CommissionersI_II_56/> Some of the soldiers initially shot into the air, at which General Dyer shouted: "Fire low. What have you been brought here for?"<ref>''Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, A Premeditated Plan'', Punjab University Chandigarh, 1969, p 89, Raja Ram; ''A Saga of Freedom Movement and Jallianwala Bagh'', Udham Singh, 2002, p 141, Prof (Dr) Sikander Singh.</ref> Later, Dyer's own testimony revealed that the crowd was not given any warning to disperse and he was not remorseful for having ordered his troops to shoot.<ref>See: ''Report of Commissioners, Vol I, II'', Bombay, 1920, Reprint New Delhi, 1976, p 55-56.</ref>

{{cquote|The worst part of the whole thing was that the firing was directed towards the exit gates through which the people were running out. There were small 3 or 4 outlets in all and bullets were actually rained over the people at all these gates... and many got trampled under the feet of the rushing crowds and thus lost their lives... even those who lay flat on the ground were fired upon.<ref>Statement of Eyewitness Mr Girdhari Lal, who happened to watch the scene from the window of his house overlooking the Jallianwala Bagh: Ref: Report of Commissioners,Vol I, II, Bombay, 1920, Reprint New Delhi, 1976, p 10-11.</ref>|cquote}}

The official reports quote 379 dead and over 1,000 injured. However, public enquiry estimates,<ref name=HP23>Home Political, Sept 1920, No 23, National Archive of India, New Delhi</ref> estimates from Government Civil Servants in the city (commissioned by the Punjab Sub-committee of Indian National Congress)<ref>Report of Commissioners, appointed by the Punjab Sub-committee of Indian National Congress, Vol I, New Delhi, p 68</ref> as well as counts from the Home Political <ref name=HP23/> cite numbers well over a thousand dead. According to a Home Political Deposit report, the number was more than 1,000, with more than 1,200 wounded.<ref>Home Political Deposit, September, 1920, No 23, National Archives of India, New Delhi; Report of Commissioners, Vol I, New Delhi.</ref> Dr. Smith, a British civil surgeon at Amritsar, indicated over 1,800 casualties.<ref>Report of Commissioners, Vol I, New Delhi, p 105</ref> The deliberate infliction of these casualties earned General Dyer the epithet of the ''"Butcher of Amritsar"'' in India. The actual estimates were suppressed by the government for political reasons.

==Threatening language==
On the day after the massacre, Mr. [[Kitchin]], the Commissioner of [[Lahore]] as well as General Dyer, both used threatening language. The following is the English translation of Dyer's [[Urdu]] statement directed at the local residents of Amritsar on the afternoon of 14 April 1919, a day after the Amritsar massacre:

<blockquote>
"You people know well that I am a [[Sepoy]] and soldier. Do you want war or peace? If you wish for a war, the Government is prepared for it, and if you want peace, then obey my orders and open all your shops; else I will shoot. For me the battlefield of France or Amritsar is the same. I am a military man and I will go straight. Neither shall I move to the right nor to the left. Speak up, if you want war? In case there is to be peace, my order is to open all shops at once. You people talk against the Government and persons educated in Germany and Bengal talk sedition. I shall report all these. Obey my orders. I do not wish to have anything else. I have served in the military for over 30 years. I understand the Indian Sepoy and Sikh people very well. You will have to obey my orders and observe peace. Otherwise the shops will be opened by force and Rifles. You will have to report to me of the Badmash. I will shoot them. Obey my orders and open shops. Speak up if you want war? You have committed a bad act in killing the English. The revenge will be taken upon you and upon your children."<ref>See: A Saga of Freedom Movement and Jallianwala Bagh, Udham Singh, 2002, p 149, Prof (Dr) Sikander Singh; Report of Commissioners,Vol I, II, Bombay, 1920, Reprint New Delhi, 1976, p 11.; [[Talk:Reginald Dyer#Terrorising Statement of Brigadier Dyer to the Local Citizen.27s Delegation .28April 14.2C 1919.29|See also Talk Page]] for full text of Dyer's Statement</ref>
</blockquote>

==Crawling order==
Brigadier Dyer designated the spot where Miss Marcella Sherwood was assaulted sacred and daytime pickets were placed at either end of the street. Anyone wishing to proceed in the street between 6am and 8pm was made to crawl the {{convert|200|yd}} on all fours, lying flat on their bellies.<ref>"Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore, they have to crawl in front of her too"{{cite book|last=Talbott|first=Strobe |title=Engaging India: diplomacy, democracy, and the bomb  |year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815783015|pages=245|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z708iXbcrNkC&pg=PA245}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Susan Kingsley|title=Aftershocks: politics and trauma in Britain, 1918-1931|year=2009|publisher=University of California|isbn=9781403993335|pages=37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t7eypXVnabIC&pg=PT49}}</ref> The order was not required at night due to a curfew. The order effectively closed the street. The houses did not have any back doors and the inhabitants could not go out without climbing down from their roofs. This order was in effect from 19&nbsp;April until 25&nbsp;April&nbsp;1919. No doctor or supplier was allowed in, resulting in the sick being unattended.

==Reaction in India and Britain==
Reaction to the massacre varied. A large section of the British population in India condoned it while many Indians were outraged. A Committee of Inquiry, chaired by Lord [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William Hunter]], was established to investigate the massacre. The committee's report condemned Dyer, arguing that in "continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error." Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. "General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view," they wrote, "(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed." The committee reported
*lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh in the beginning was an error
*length of firing showed a grave error
*Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned
*lack of attention to the wounded was not acceptable
He was met by Lieutenant-General Sir [[Havelock Hudson]], who told him that he was relieved of his command. He was told later by the Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet|Charles Monro]], to resign his post and that he would not be reemployed.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yehassAM-t0C&pg=PT105&lpg=PT105&dq=General+Sir+Havelock+Hudson+Amritsar+massacre&source=bl&ots=YFRT0FHMTi&sig=ctTJC9P9qQX-NuefJXvVVw-oWP0&hl=en&ei=HduaTsiVO8bY8gPcr5jqBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=General%20Sir%20Havelock%20Hudson%20Amritsar%20massacre&f=false ''Mariners, Merchants and the Military Too'' By Phillip E Jones]</ref>

While many in Britain supported General Dyer, including [[Rudyard Kipling]], who started a fund for (General Dyer) "the man who saved India" and contributed 50 pounds sterling, and raised over 26,000 pounds and presented to him on his retirement and settling in England, there were a number of exceptions:

==Return to Britain==
On his return to Britain, Brigadier Dyer was presented with a purse of 26,000 pounds sterling, a huge sum in those days, which emerged from a collection on his behalf by the ''[[Morning Post]]'', a conservative, pro-Imperialistic newspaper, which later merged with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''. A Thirteen Women Committee was constituted to present "the Saviour of the Punjab with sword of honour and a purse." This single incident angered the [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] so much that he renounced his knighthood in protest. The ''Morning Post'' had supported Dyer<U+2019>s action on grounds stating that the massacre was necessary to "Protect the honour of European Women."<ref>Morning Post, cited in Derek Sayer, ''British Reaction of Amritsar massacre'', 1919-20, reprinted in ''Jallianwala Bagh Commemoration Volume'', Patiala, 1997, p 45.</ref> The ''Morning Post'' blamed Mr [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Montagu]], Secretary of State (India), and not General Dyer for the massacre and asked for his court trial. Mr [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Montagu]], on the other hand, in a long letter to the Viceroy, passed the blame to [[Michael O'Dwyer]] and admitted "I feel that O<U+2019>Dwyer represents a regime that is doomed."{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

General Dyer was oblivious of the events that he was responsible for. He wrote an article in the ''Globe'' of 21 January 1921, titled, "The Peril to the Empire." It commenced with "India does not want self-government. She does not understand it." He wrote later
*It is only to an enlightened people that free speech and a free press can be extended. The Indian people want no such enlightenment.
*There should be an eleventh commandment in India, "Thou shalt not agitate."
*The time will come to India when a strong hand will be exerted against malice and 'perversion' of good order.
*Gandhi will not lead India to capable self-government. The British Raj must continue, firm and unshaken in its administration of justice to all men.

In the British Army Museum in London, a testimonial to Dyer by the British Monarch is the first exhibit along the wall of the staircase as one ascends to the first floor devoted to the Indian Army.<ref name=ColonelAthaleDiaries/>

==Death==
<!--
Do not insert text about Michael O'Dwyer's death here. There is an article about O'Dwyer, and information about his death belongs there, not in this article.

Dyer suffered a series of strokes during the last years of his life and he became increasingly isolated due to the paralysis and speechlessness inflicted by his strokes. He died of cerebral hemorrhage and arteriosclerosis in 1927.<ref name=col>{{cite book|pages=420<U+2013>424|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|ISBN=1852855754, 9781852855758|subject=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> He died of a broken heart according to his family. On his death bed, Dyer reportedly refused the gentle and comforting words of his care giver and said:

{{cquote|Thank you, but I don't want to get better. So many people who knew the condition of Amritsar say I did right...but so many others say I did wrong. I only want to die and know from my Maker whether I did right or wrong.||author=Reginald Dyer on his death bed quoted in The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer by Nigel Collett}}

The ''[[Morning Post]]'' remembered him in an article titled "The Man Who Saved India" and "He Did His Duty" but the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' wrote a contrary opinion, "No British action, during the whole course of our history in India, has struck a severer blow to Indian faith in British justice than the massacre at Amritsar."

== Popular culture==
Dyer is played by [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] in the 1982 film [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]. Dyer's scenes in the film depict the massacre as well as Dyer's testimony to the inquisition panel.

A fictionalised account of Dyer's actions in Amritsar is contained in the 1981 prize winning novel ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', by author [[Salman Rushdie]]. (See [[List of Midnight's Children characters]]).

== Role of Michael O'Dwyer ==
[[Image:Sir-Michael-ODwyer.jpg|right|100px|thumb|Sir Michael O'Dwyer]]

[[Michael O'Dwyer]], the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab from 1912 to 1919, endorsed General Dyer and called the massacre a "correct" action,<ref>''Disorder Inquiry Committee Report'', Vol II, p 197</ref>. Some historians now believe he premeditated the massacre and set Dyer to work.<ref>''The Massacre that Ended the Raj'', London, 1981, p 78, Alfred Draper</ref><ref>Rajit K. Mazumder, ''The Indian army and the making of Punjab'' (2003) pp 239-40</ref><ref>John Keay, ''India: a history'' (2001) p 475</ref><ref>Lawrence James, ''The Rise and fall of the British Empire'' (1997) p 417</ref> Many Indians blamed O'Dwyer and while Dyer was never assaulted O'Dwyer was assassinated in London in 1940 for his role.
