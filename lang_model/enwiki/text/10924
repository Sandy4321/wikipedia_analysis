'''Sir George Oswald Browning "Gubby" Allen'''{{#tag:ref|Allen was generally known as G. O. Allen as a cricketer, and his third name was not used consistently. However, while at Eton, his initials of G. O. B. Allen gave rise to the nickname "Gobby", which in time became "Gubby". His family knew him as "Obie", but very few of even his close friends and family ever called him "George".<ref>Swanton, p. 1.</ref>|group=notes}} [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (31 July 1902 <U+2013> 29 November 1989) was a [[cricketer]] who played for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and [[England national cricket team|England]]. Allen was a fast bowler and hard-hitting [[batting order (cricket)|lower-order]] batsman, who captained England in eleven [[Test cricket|Test]] matches. He later became an influential cricket administrator, holding key positions in the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], which effectively ruled cricket at the time, and acting as chairman of the England selectors.

Allen was born in Australia but moved to England at an early age. He first became well known as a cricketer playing for [[Eton College]] then at Cambridge, where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. Upon leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex and improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments prevented him playing regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s, he was on the verge of the England Test team, He made his debut for England in 1930, and was usually in contention for a place when available until the late 1930s. During the controversial [[Bodyline]] tour of 1932<U+2013>33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his team-mates. From 1933, Allen worked in the [[London Stock Exchange]], which limited his time available for cricket. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936<U+2013>37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3<U+2013>2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play for Middlesex before and after the Second World War, when he worked in Military Intelligence. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic and even wild, but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he used his knowledge of cricketing technique to contribute heavily to the MCC coaching manual.

Allen's first-class career gradually came to a close after the war, and he moved into administration. He held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal [[bowling action]]s. He became chairman of selectors in 1955 and presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he was highly involved in the team and worked closely with the captain. In 1963 he became MCC President, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the [[D'Oliveira affair]], during which he withheld information from the rest of the MCC which affected [[Basil D'Oliveira]] and the status of a forthcoming, but later abandoned, tour of South Africa.

==Early life==
Allen was the second of three children born to Walter Allen and his wife Marguerite (Pearl) Lamb.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web | last =Woodcock | first = John| title = Allen, Sir George Oswald Browning (1902<U+2013>1989) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition = online | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40143?docPos=1 | accessdate = 11 March 2013}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Allen's team-mate [[Bob Wyatt]] recalled rumours in the 1930s that the [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] cricketer [[Pelham Warner]] was Allen's real father, and the cricket historian David Frith suggests that similar stories circulated in the 1980s, but only circumstantial evidence supports these rumours. Frith suggests that the rumours may have been spread maliciously by enemies of Allen, but points out that Warner favoured Allen several times during his career, which he followed closely. Frith believes that Allen looked more like Warner than Walter Allen, and that Warner was an admirer of Pearl Allen in the early 1900s. According to Frith, the biography of Warner by Gerald Howat relates that Warner's wife was jealous of Pearl, and suggests that Warner regarded Allen as a "member of the family". Howat also calls Allen a "favoured son" of Warner.<ref name=father>Frith, pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref>|group=notes}} Allen was born in 1902 in Sydney, Australia.<ref name=S20>Swanton, p. 20.</ref> His family had lived in Australia since his great great grandparents moved from England in 1816,<ref>Swanton, pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref> and his paternal uncle played cricket for Australia.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to England<U+2014>initially so that the children would benefit from an English education.<ref name=S20/> At first, the family lived in a London flat, but in later years moved to live in country villages;<ref name=S21>Swanton, p. 21.</ref> they also abandoned plans to return to Australia, discovering that they enjoyed England.<ref>Swanton, p. 2.</ref> 

Having previously been educated by a governess, Allen joined [[Summer Fields School]] in Oxford in 1912.<ref name=S21/> He began to play cricket seriously at school;<ref>Swanton, pp. 20, 22.</ref> by his second year, he was in the school second team, and progressed to the first team then to the captaincy.<ref>Swanton, p. 23.</ref> His ability attracted the attention of [[Eton College]]; a friend of his father, [[Cyril Wells]], was cricket coach there and he enticed Allen senior to send his son to the school<ref name=S25>Swanton, p. 25.</ref><U+2014>his family originally planned to send him to [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]]. Against Allen's wishes, and despite the costs involved,<ref>Swanton, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref> he went to Eton in the winter of 1915<U+2013>16.<ref name=S27>Swanton, p. 27.</ref>

At Eton, Allen played many sports,<ref>Swanton, pp. 43<U+2013>44.</ref> but his academic performance was respectable at best,<ref name=S40/> and he later admitted to laziness.<ref>Swanton, p. 43.</ref> In cricket, Allen played for his [[House system|school house team]] and had reasonable success with bat and ball; by 1918 was captain. After a trial match, and a spell in the school second team, he progressed to the Eton first team in 1919.<ref>Swanton, pp. 27<U+2013>30</ref> The effects of a rib injury limited his bowling, and he achieved little with the bat. Even so, he was chosen to play in the prestigious match against [[Harrow School]], played annually at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]].<ref>Swanton, p. 31.</ref> In his second innings, he scored 69 runs, the highest individual score of the game, and Eton won the match.<ref>Swanton, pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref> His rib injury continued to trouble him in 1920, and caused him such pain that he considered abandoning bowling altogether. The newly appointed Eton coach [[George Hirst]] persuaded him to continue,<ref>Swanton, p. 37.</ref> and a few weeks later Allen took nine for 19 (nine wickets while conceding 19 runs) in an innings against Winchester. But other than this performance, Allen achieved little.<ref>Swanton, pp. 38<U+2013>39.</ref> More successful in 1921, he opened the batting for a time; he also opened the bowling, topping the [[bowling average]]s.<ref>Swanton, p. 42.</ref> He had some success at Lord's against Harrow and a particularly fast bowling spell in this match was seen by [[Hubert Ashton]], who was to captain the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University team]] the following year<ref>Swanton, pp. 41<U+2013>42.</ref><U+2014>Allen had already been approved for a place at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] beginning later that year.<ref name=S40>Swanton, p. 40.</ref> He was chosen to play in the annual matches at Lord's in which the best schoolboys opposed each other, but was forced to withdraw with sunstroke.<ref>Swanton, pp. 42<U+2013>43.</ref>

==First-class cricketer==

===Cambridge University===
Towards the end of the 1921 season, Allen was invited to play [[first-class cricket]] for Middlesex,<ref name=S45>Swanton, p. 45.</ref> for whom he qualified by residence.<ref>Swanton, p. 46.</ref> At the time, it was not unusual for schoolboys to play county cricket; several Eton pupils played during the 1921 season.<ref name=S45/> Allen believed that Pelham Warner, who often supported young Middlesex cricketers, encouraged his selection by the club, despite the potential risks to the team's position.<ref>Marshall, pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref> Allen made his first-class debut against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] on 21 August 1921 and made one other appearance that season without achieving much in either match.<ref name=figures>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=559&testing=0&opponentmatch=exact&playername=&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&howout=All&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason=| title = Player Oracle GOB Allen| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 18 March 2013}}</ref>

Allen had more opportunities with Cambridge in 1922.<ref name=S47>Swanton, p. 47.</ref> Having failed in a trial match, he was left out of the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|cricket team's]] first game; as the University was playing Middlesex, he played for the opposition instead and took six for 13. After success in the following games<U+2014>including ten wickets in the game against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]<U+2014>Allen was awarded his [[Blue (university sport)|blue]].<ref name=figures/><ref>Swanton, pp. 47<U+2013>49.</ref> Around this time, he began to bowl [[Fast bowling|fast]] for the first time.<ref name=S48>Swanton, p. 48.</ref> In the [[The University Match (cricket)|University match]] against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]], he had match figures of nine for 78 in a comfortable Cambridge victory.<ref name=S51>Swanton, p. 51.</ref> This was Cambridge's last game of the season<U+2014>Allen had taken 49 first-class wickets at an average of 15.<ref name=S51/> Questions were raised at the time about the fairness of his [[bowling action]]. A press report during the season suggested that there were "murmurs" that he [[Throwing (cricket)|threw]] rather than bowled the ball, and the following year's ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' suggested that he threw when he bowled his fastest deliveries. In his biography of Allen, [[E. W. Swanton]] suggests that these rumours were neither widespread nor repeated later in Allen's career, and that they may have resulted from a one-off lapse.<ref name=S48/> Towards the end of the season, Allen returned to the Middlesex team and his 15 wickets placed him at the top of the county's bowling averages.<ref>Swanton, p. 52.</ref>

An inheritance from an uncle allowed Allen to live in some comfort over the winter of 1922<U+2013>23.<ref name=S53>Swanton, p. 53.</ref> He played rugby for the Trinity team before resuming cricket for the 1923 season.<ref name="Swanton, p. 57">Swanton, p. 57.</ref> He began the season well, reaching fifty in a first-class match for the first time against Middlesex and taking six for 89 in the same game. Further bowling success followed but before the University match, he once more injured his rib muscles. Persuaded to play anyway, Allen could only bowl short spells which lacked incisiveness and Cambridge lost heavily.<ref>Swanton, pp. 54<U+2013>55.</ref> Several critics, including some team-mates, believed he did not try.<ref name=S63/> During the match, Allen consulted a specialist over his frequent rib injuries; the specialist's treatment and a period of rest cured the problem for the remainder of his career.<ref name=S56>Swanton, p. 56.</ref> Allen's Cambridge season was further marred by differences with his captain, [[Claude Ashton]], over team selections and tactics.<ref>Swanton, p. 54.</ref> The 1923 University Match was his final game for Cambridge as the University, unhappy with his lack of academic work, [[Rustication (academia)|rusticated]] him in the summer.{{#tag:ref|Had the cricket team elected Allen as their captain for the following season, another Cambridge college would have taken him, but he was passed over for the position. He had been appointed the cricket team's secretary after the 1922 season, a position which was often a stepping-stone to the captaincy.<ref name=S53/> Before the election for 1924, Allen had discussed the position with Ashton, who was to nominate his successor before voting; Ashton misunderstood Allen's comments, told the meeting that Allen was "happy not to be appointed", and nominated [[Tom Lowry]], who was subsequently elected.<ref name=S56/>|group=notes}}<ref name=S56/>

Later in the 1923 season, Allen was recalled by Middlesex and played five further games for the county, for whom he played his highest innings to date when he scored 70 against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].<ref name=figures/><ref name="Swanton, p. 57"/> At the end of the season, he was chosen in two [[Scarborough Festival]] games; one of these was the prestigious [[Gentlemen v Players]] match, in which he appeared for the amateur "Gentlemen".<ref name=figures/><ref name=S58>Swanton, p. 58.</ref> This was the first of Allen's 11 appearances for the Gentlemen in this fixture between 1923 and 1938.<ref>Marshall, p. 336.</ref> In the whole season, he took 66 wickets at 19.50 and scored 528 runs at 24.00.<ref name=fcbatting>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/559/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Gubby Allen| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 23 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=fcbowling>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/559/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-class Bowling in Each Season by Gubby Allen| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 23 March 2013}}</ref>

===Middlesex===
In late 1923, having left Cambridge, Allen took a job in [[City of London|the City]] (London's financial district) working for the [[Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation]] as an [[Underwriting|underwriter]].<ref name=S58/> He was particularly well-off financially, having lost heavily while investing in the rubber market, <ref name=S65>Swanton, p. 65.</ref> and had to work full-time: throughout his career, he could not afford to take too much time away from business.<ref>Marshall, p. 113.</ref> He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket<U+2014>including for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC)<U+2014>and country house cricket.<ref name=S65/> 

Allen was free to play regularly for Middlesex in 1924.<ref name=S58/> The team was involved in a close race for the County Championship with Yorkshire,<ref name=S58/> and Allen had several successful matches.<ref name=S63>Swanton, p. 63.</ref> A surge of good form late in the season prompted the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' to suggest that he should be included in the MCC team to tour Australia that winter.<ref>Swanton, p. 64.</ref> Allen ended the season with 568 runs at 21.84 and 50 wickets at 17.48.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> He played less often in 1925, scoring 392 runs and taking 39 wickets,<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> but scored his maiden first-class century in the Gentlemen v Players match at [[the Oval]], despite attending an all-night party beforehand.<ref>Swanton, p. 68<U+2013>69.</ref> He was also chosen for the first time to represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, where he scored 52.<ref>Swanton, p. 70.</ref> His reputation grew steadily at this time,<ref>Swanton, p. 71.</ref> and by the beginning of the 1926 season, he and fellow fast bowler [[Harold Larwood]] were tipped in the press to be chosen in the England team against Australia that summer. Allen began well for Middlesex, taking five wickets in an innings when the county played the Australians, but he was less successful in a trial match to help choose the England team. Larwood was chosen for the Test series; Allen was not.<ref>Swanton, pp. 72<U+2013>73.</ref> Allen scored his first century for Middlesex in the course of the season in a game against Nottinghamshire.<ref>Swanton, p. 74.</ref> With the ball, he began to open the bowling occasionally for Middlesex, having been the third or fourth bowler in previous seasons.<ref>Swanton, pp. 72, 74.</ref> Overall, he scored 771 runs, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career, at an average of 29.65 and took 44 wickets at 28.27.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

During the winter of 1926<U+2013>27, Allen toured Argentina to play first-class cricket with an MCC team of moderate ability<U+2014>many players were chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons.<ref>Swanton, pp. 75<U+2013>77.</ref> When he returned to England, he played eight matches before the end of June,<ref name=figures/> including a game for the MCC against the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927|touring New Zealand team]] in which he scored a century and took ten wickets in the match.<ref name=S77>Swanton, p. 77.</ref> In total, he scored 482 runs at an average of 43.81 and took 19 wickets,<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> but this was the last of his regular cricket until 1929.<ref name="Swanton, pp. 77<U+2013>78">Swanton, pp. 77<U+2013>78.</ref> He declined an invitation to tour South Africa with an MCC team,<ref>Swanton, p. 95.</ref> and work limited him to two first-class games for Middlesex in 1928.<ref name=figures/><ref name="Swanton, p. 79">Swanton, p. 79.</ref>

Through [[Vivian Smith, 1st Baron Bicester|Vivian Hugh Smith]], the father of some old school-mates, Allen had the opportunity to work in France. He moved to Lyons for 18 months to work in a silk business.<ref name="Swanton, pp. 77<U+2013>78"/> During his time there, Allen became aware that the business was not financially sound; he warned Hugh Smith, who after some enquiries, withdrew from the business, along with his fellow investor Sir Frederick Richmond. The latter subsequently offered Allen work at [[Debenhams|Debenham's]], of which he was chairman. Allen accepted,<ref>Swanton, pp. 78<U+2013>79.</ref> and worked at Debenham's until 1933. Initially, he was first assistant to the Works Department manager; for his last two years, he worked as the assistant to the Assistant general manager.<ref>Swanton, p. 142.</ref>

While at Debenham's, Allen was allowed a leave to play cricket,<ref name="Swanton, p. 79"/> and for the 1929 season intended to fight for a place in the England team.<ref>Swanton, p. 80.</ref> During his first appearance of the season he performed well but suffered a strain in his next game, which reinforced an impression in the press<U+2014>articulated by Pelham Warner among others<U+2014>that he was injury prone and inclined to hypochondria.<ref>Swanton, pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> His next appearance came a fortnight later at Lord's against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]];<ref name=figures/> that team had won the County Championship each year since 1926.<ref name=S81>Swanton, p. 81.</ref> Owing to his work at Debenham's, Allen arrived by prior agreement around 20 minutes after play started.<ref name=Williamson>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=The shop assistant who took all ten| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/375242.html| publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=31 March 2013| date=25 October 2008}}</ref> He took the first three wickets, but Lancashire were batting comfortably at 215 for three wickets.<ref name=Williamson/> Around the tea interval, Allen took the last seven wickets in 69 [[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]] while conceding 13 runs from his bowling, including the last four wickets in five balls.<ref name=Williamson/><ref name=S82>Swanton, p. 82.</ref> In total, he took all ten wickets at a cost of 40 runs, to become only the second man to take all ten wickets in a first-class match at Lord's since 1874, and the last to date.<ref name=S82/><ref>{{cite web|title=Ten Wickets in an innings in First-Class matches|url=http://www.wisdenrecords.com/Records/First_Class/Overall/Bowling/Best_Bowling_in_an_Innings.html|publisher=Wisden|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> He was praised in the press, but the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' correspondent suggested that a weak batting performance flattered him, and ''Wisden'' merely described this as one of several good performances in the game.<ref name=Williamson/> Despite Allen's success and continued good form, the England selectors preferred Larwood in the Test team against South Africa and preferred others even when Larwood was injured.<ref>Swanton, pp. 82<U+2013>85.</ref> Allen's bowling was inconsistent throughout the season;<ref>Swanton, p. 84.</ref> he finished with 31 wickets at 25.87 and scored 544 at 45.33.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

==Test match career==

===Debut===
During 1930, Allen once more had leave in which he could play cricket.<ref>Swanton, p. 85.</ref> He was among the front-runners for a place in the England team, albeit from a large pool of potential selections.<ref name="Swanton, pp. 85<U+2013>86">Swanton, pp. 85<U+2013>86.</ref> His first appearance of the season was for the MCC against the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|Australian touring team]]. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, his rivals for an England place<U+2014>including [[Maurice Allom]] as an opening bowler and [[Greville Stevens]] as an all-rounder<U+2014>were more successful.<ref name="Swanton, pp. 85<U+2013>86"/> Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test. Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the England team, fell ill during that match. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] while the England team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77.<ref>Swanton, p. 86.</ref> His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game provoked criticism in the press.<ref>Swanton, p. 87.</ref>

On the morning of the match, Larwood was unfit and Allen played. England batted first, and Allen scored three runs before being dismissed on the first afternoon.<ref>Swanton, p. 88.</ref> On the second morning, an article by Trevor Wignall, a popular journalist who wrote sensational sports stories, in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' suggested that the crowd's enjoyment of the day was marred by Allen's inclusion on the grounds of his Australian birth. Wignall claimed that the public felt Allen should have been omitted, and that the selectors were rumoured to be ignorant of his birthplace.<ref>Swanton, pp. 88<U+2013>90.</ref> That day, Allen opened the bowling for England; after a slow start, the Australian openers added 162 runs before the first wicket fell. Like the other bowlers, Allen then rapidly conceded runs to [[Donald Bradman]], who scored 254 runs. Australia scored 729 in reply to England's 425, and Allen returned bowling figures of none for 115 from 34 [[Over (cricket)|overs]].<ref>Swanton, pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref> England lost early wickets in their second innings, and when Allen came in to bat, the score was 147 for five wickets, still 167 behind on a wicket which helped the spin bowlers. He scored 57 and shared a partnership of 125 with his captain, [[Percy Chapman]], to take England into the lead but Australia won the match by seven wickets.<ref>Swanton, pp. 89, 91.</ref> In contrast to the reaction to his bowling, Allen's innings was praised in the press.<ref>Swanton, p. 92.</ref> This was his only Test match of the series.<ref name=figures/>

Allen was unsuccessful in the Gentlemen v Players game, but played several more times for Middlesex and performed effectively with the ball. He continued to struggle when batting, and his highest innings of the year came in the end-of-season Scarborough Festival in which he played an innings of 77.<ref name=S94>Swanton, p. 94.</ref> In total, he scored 281 runs at 17.56 and took 42 wickets at 22.19.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> He was not invited on the MCC tour of South Africa and spent the English winter playing [[Squash (sport)|squash]]: he reached the third round of the Amateur Squash Championship.<ref>Swanton, pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref>

===Success===
Allen's cricket remained limited in 1931.<ref name=S96>Swanton, p. 96.</ref> He played several early games for Middlesex with some all-round success. Larwood took 20 wickets in two games,<ref name=S96/> and was chosen in the team for the first Test against the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1931|New Zealand]] team, along with his Nottinghamshire team-mate [[Bill Voce]].{{#tag:ref|New Zealand were scheduled to play only one Test in 1931. After their strong performance in that match, a further two Tests were added to their programme.<ref name=S99>Swanton, p. 99.</ref>|group=notes}} Allen was initially omitted, but was later added to the team when Larwood withdrew with an ankle injury.<ref>Swanton, pp. 96<U+2013>97.</ref> According to Anthony Meredith, writing in ''[[The Cricketer]]'' in 2002, Pelham Warner added Allen to the team without consulting his fellow selectors, to their considerable annoyance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meredith|first=Anthony| title=Groomed for success| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/215798.html| publisher=ESPNCricinfo, reprinted from ''The Cricketer''| accessdate=6 April 2013|date=July 2002}}</ref> Allen did not have a particularly good match as a bowler, taking three wickets in the game,<ref>Swanton, p. 97.</ref> but was successful with the bat.

Allen's selection continued to be questioned in the press.<ref name=S101>Swanton, p. 101.</ref> Playing to get in form after three weeks with no cricket, he took six for 38; around the same time, Larwood was ruled out of the England team after an injury in a car crash.<ref name=S100>Swanton, p. 100.</ref> Allen played in the second Test; he did not bat, but took five for 14 in New Zealand's first innings after being used as the fifth bowler.<ref name=S101/> England won that game, and the next was drawn after rain washed out the first two days; Allen neither batted nor bowled.<ref name=S101/> In the series, he took eight wickets at an average of 16.12.<ref name=tbowl>{{cite web|title=Test Bowling in Each Season by Gubby Allen|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/559/t_Bowling_by_Season.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> He ended the season with 401 first-class runs at 30.84 and 40 wickets at 18.77.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

Allen played even less frequently in 1932, even though he wanted to secure a place in the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932<U+2013>33|MCC team to tour Australia]] during the 1932<U+2013>33 season.<ref name=S103>Swanton, p. 103.</ref> He played four times for Middlesex, with a long interval between his first and second appearances, and played in two Test trial games, but both he and Larwood did not play in the season's only Test match.<ref name=S104>Swanton, p. 104.</ref> Allen was generally successful, but his most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, in which many of those involved were potential selections for the touring team.

===Bodyline series===

The MCC{{#tag:ref|Throughout Allen's career, the MCC organised and administered English cricket. Official English touring teams always played under the name of MCC and were only styled "England" during Test matches.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-history/| title = MCC History| publisher = Marylebone Cricket Club| accessdate = 8 April 2013}}</ref>|group=notes}} tour of Australia during the 1932<U+2013>33 season was highly controversial on account of what came to be known as [[Bodyline]] bowling by the English team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=A brief history ... Bodyline|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bodyline/content/story/148537.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> The English tactics involved bowling at [[leg stump]] or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at the batsman's body and with a ring of fielders ranged on the [[leg side]] to catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The tactic was designed to be intimidatory,<ref>Douglas, p. 103.</ref> and aimed largely at [[Donald Bradman]] who had dominated the English bowling in 1930.<ref>Douglas, pp. 86, 111.</ref> Bodyline was largely designed and implemented by [[Douglas Jardine]], the MCC captain.<ref>Swanton, p. 110.</ref> Allen was one of four fast bowlers chosen for the tour,<ref name=S111>Swanton, p. 111.</ref> but he did not go along with Jardine's instructions to "hate" the opposition. Nevertheless, the two men got along,<ref name=S109>Swanton, p. 109.</ref> and Allen later claimed to be Jardine's "best friend" on the tour.<ref name="F116"/> However, Allen wrote home that Jardine was "the stupidest man I know", claimed to be terrified of him and suggested that at times he felt like killing him.<ref>Frith, pp. 107, 116.</ref>

Jardine did not initially plan to include Allen in the Test team,<ref name=S109/> but the latter's bowling in the opening tour matches brought him into the frame.<ref name=S113>Swanton, p. 113.</ref> In his first game, he unsettled and dismissed Bradman with his pace;<ref name=S113/> in later years [[Jack Hobbs]], who reported on the game, suggested that Bradman was intimidated by Allen, and [[Jack Fingleton]], who played in the team with Bradman, claimed that he refused to face Allen's bowling.<ref>Frith, p. 83.</ref> Allen later wrote home that Bradman was a "terrible little coward" of fast bowling; the two men later became friends, and Bradman was never made aware of what Allen wrote.<ref name=F116/>

Allen played in England's victory in the first Test but took only one wicket,<ref name=figures/> and in his own opinion bowled badly.<ref>Swanton, p. 115, 118.</ref> He retained his place as part of a four-man pace attack in the second Test, took four wickets on a slow-paced pitch and was one of the most successful English batsmen in the match. Australia levelled the series after Bradman scored a century,<ref>Swanton, pp. 118<U+2013>22.</ref> but England won the remaining three matches of the series.<ref name=figures/> In the third game, Allen opened the bowling and took four wickets in each innings. His performance was praised by critics and enhanced his reputation.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151781.html| title = England v Australia 1932<U+2013>33 (Third Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1934 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 8 April 2013}}</ref><ref>Swanton, p. 128.</ref> As Voce missed the fourth Test with injury, Allen bowled more in that game and took five wickets, but suffered a side-strain in the second innings.<ref>Swanton, p. 130.</ref> The injury prevented Allen bowling at full pace in the final Test; he played despite his own reservations but struggled throughout the game.<ref>Swanton, p. 132.</ref> In total, Allen took 21 Test wickets at an average of 28.23 and scored 163 runs at 23.28.<ref name=tbat/><ref name=tbowl/> In his review of the tour for ''Wisden'', Sydney Southerton wrote: "G. O. Allen, about whose selection many hard things were at the time said, fully justified his choice&nbsp;... He accomplished great work, often getting rid of batsmen likely to be dangerous; his fielding close in on the leg side was uniformly good and he played several excellent innings. Altogether a most useful man in the team."<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151778.html| title = The M.C.C. team in Australia and New Zealand, 1932<U+2013>33| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1934 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 8 April 2013}}</ref> Jardine praised his contribution after the tour, both to Allen's family and in his official report.<ref>Swanton, p. 136.</ref> In all first-class matches, Allen scored 397 runs at 24.81 and took 39 wickets at 23.05.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> In his biography of Jardine, Christopher Douglas suggests: "[Allen] thrived on the intensive programme of matches and was able to build up his form and consistency to a standard that he hardly ever matched in England."<ref name=D121/>

Throughout the series, Allen refused to use Bodyline tactics,{{#tag:ref|Allen's definition of Bodyline was different to that of other people. He maintained that England did not use Bodyline until the second innings of the second Test, when Larwood began to bowl outside leg stump. He maintained that the bowling in the first Test was acceptable and not Bodyline.<ref>Swanton, pp. 137<U+2013>38.</ref> Speaking to David Frith, he denied that Bodyline was used in the first match, and when challenged, replied: "My dear chap, I was ''there''."<ref>Frith, p. 120.</ref> Frith also reports that on the first day of the second Test, Allen had up to five fielders on the leg side, and one of his deliveries struck the Australian captain [[Bill Woodfull]] on the chest.<ref>Frith, p. 149.</ref> |group=notes}}<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=S111/> and openly said so within the team.<ref>Swanton, p. 127.</ref><ref>Douglas, p. 133.</ref> His attitude made him popular with spectators.<ref name=F116>Frith, p. 116.</ref> Jardine twice tried to force the issue. Before the first Test, he asked Allen to bowl more bouncers with fielders on the leg side; Allen refused, saying he did not want to play cricket like that and that Jardine should leave him out if he was not happy.<ref name=F116/> Prior to the second Test, Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short, and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity. Allen wrote home: "Well, I burst and said a good deal about swollen-headed, gutless, uneducated miners."<ref>Quoted in Frith, p. 146.</ref> Allen threatened not to play, and to go home to relate the events of the tour to the press. Jardine did not pursue the matter and Allen remained in the team.<ref name=F146>Frith, p. 146.</ref> Others in the team were also opposed to Bodyline. The [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi]] refused to field in the "leg trap"<U+2014>the ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries<U+2014>during the first Test.{{#tag:ref|Although Pataudi refused to field in the leg trap in the first Test, contemporary diagrams show that he did so during the second Test.<ref name=F118/>|group=notes}}<ref name=F118>Frith, p. 118.</ref><ref>Douglas, p. 148.</ref> Allen had no compunction fielding there; at [[Fielding_(cricket)#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|short leg]] he held five catches from Larwood's bowling in the series.<ref name=F116/> Upon his return to England, Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics, and he was involved in subsequent legislation to ban it after the 1934 season.<ref>Swanton, pp. 143<U+2013>58.</ref>

===Change of career===
During the Bodyline tour, his first visit to Australia since the age of six, Allen spent time visiting friends and family.<ref>Swanton, pp. 112, 114<U+2013>15.</ref> Before returning to England, the MCC played two Tests in New Zealand. Allen played in both, but batted just once and, still feeling the effects of his injury, took only two wickets.<ref name=figures/><ref>Swanton, p. 140.</ref> The team returned to England via Canada, but Allen parted company in Vancouver to meet friends in Los Angeles. During his trip, he met several Hollywood stars and passed through Chicago and New York on his way back to England.<ref>Swanton, pp. 140<U+2013>42.</ref><ref name=F346>Frith, p. 346.</ref> In New York, he met and fell in love with Norah Grace, the daughter of a shipping magnate. She travelled to England in 1934, and the pair wrote frequently to each other, but Grace died from [[Bright's disease]] in 1935.<ref name=F346/><ref name="Swanton, pp. 141<U+2013>42">Swanton, pp. 141<U+2013>42.</ref>

Allen did not feel suited to working in a department store, and on his return home took a job with the [[Stockbroker|stockbroking company]] David Bevan and Co.<ref name="Swanton, pp. 141<U+2013>42"/> Subsequently, he played little cricket in 1933, playing only bank holiday matches for Middlesex.<ref name="Swanton">Swanton, p. 143.</ref> He planned to be unavailable for the seasons Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was unavailable with injury and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded to play in the first Test.<ref>Swanton, p. 144.</ref> He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team.<ref name=S146>Swanton, p. 146.</ref> In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>That December, Allen was elected as a member of the Stock Exchange.<ref name=S147/>

As the 1934 season began, Allen was recovering from an operation to repair a [[Hernia|rupture]] and played only once before the Ashes series played that summer.<ref name=S147>Swanton, pp. 147<U+2013>48.</ref> He scored a century before the second Test but an injury ruled him out. Once fit, he was chosen for the third Test.<ref name=S148>Swanton, p. 148.</ref> In a drawn game, Allen scored 61 runs but took no wickets; troubled by uneven footholds, he bowled three [[Wide (cricket)|wides]] and four [[no ball]]s during his first over, which lasted for 13 deliveries.<ref>Swanton, pp. 150<U+2013>51.</ref> He was selected for the fourth Test but, unhappy with his fitness, withdrew to play for Middlesex. He was successful in several games preceding the final, deciding Test, and was included in the team.<ref>Swanton, pp. 152<U+2013>54.</ref> Australia won comfortably after scoring 701 in their first innings; Allen took four for 170 and was wicketless in the second innings.<ref>Swanton, pp. 155<U+2013>56.</ref> In two Tests, he took five wickets at an average in excess of 70 and scored 106 runs at 35.33.<ref name=tbat/><ref name=tbowl/> In all first-class games that season he scored 438 runs at 25.76 and took 51 wickets at 27.49.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> Amid growing speculation that Allen would be chosen as the next England captain, Warner arranged for him to captain a low-key tour to Gibraltar in early 1935. During the return journey, Allen pulled a muscle when his ship pitched unexpectedly; the injury limited his cricket during 1935. He played twice, and after taking ten wickets against Lancashire in the second game bowling at a reduced pace, he withdrew from the rest of the season on medical advice.<ref>Swanton, pp. 159<U+2013>60.</ref> Off the field, Allen was elected to the MCC Committee; it was highly unusual for a committee member to be as young as 32 years old.<ref>Swanton, p. 209.</ref>

==England captain==

===Selection as captain===
Prior to the 1936 season, Allen was the leading contender to replace [[Bob Wyatt]] as England captain; under Wyatt's leadership, the team had lost three successive Test series.<ref>Swanton, pp. 161, 164.</ref> Although still unable to play regularly,<ref name=S161>Swanton, p. 161.</ref> Allen played 16 matches, his most in a season since 1926; he scored 598 runs at an average of 35.17, and took 81 wickets, his best return in a season.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> He began in good all-round form for Middlesex.<ref name=S161/> When selected to lead one of the teams in a Test trial match, his leadership was effective enough for the selectors to name him as England captain for the series against India,<ref>Swanton, pp. 162<U+2013>64.</ref> although his appointment was not universally welcomed in the press.<ref>Swanton, p. 164.</ref> Against an Indian side riven with internal tensions, and on a difficult pitch for batsmen,<ref>Swanton, p. 165.</ref> England won the first Test by eight wickets. Allen took five for 35 in his first innings as captain and a further five wickets in the second innings, making this the only Test in which he took ten wickets.<ref name=figures/><ref>Swanton, pp. 165<U+2013>66.</ref> The selectors at this time set about choosing a captain and team for the MCC tour of Australia in the 1936<U+2013>37 season.  At least one selector favoured [[Claude Ashton]], who played first-class cricket infrequently; Allen informed the selectors that, were Ashton to be made captain, he would not take part in the tour.<ref name=M114>Marshall, p. 114.</ref> Soon after the first Test, Allen was chosen to captain the Gentlemen against the Players, the only time he did so, and the MCC announced that he would captain the MCC in Australia.<ref>Swanton, p. 167.</ref> Allen believed that Warner was influential in securing his appointment, but that his Australian background was also important given that the tour had to repair tensions left over from 1932<U+2013>33.<ref name=M114/>

Allen captained England in the remaining two Tests against India. The second game was drawn but England won the third and Allen took seven for 80, his best figures in Test matches.<ref name=figures/><ref>Swanton, pp. 168<U+2013>69, 172<U+2013>73.</ref> In the Tests, Allen scored 27 runs in three innings, and took 20 wickets at 16.50.<ref name=tbat/><ref name=tbowl/> His good form for Middlesex continued throughout the season and he performed well against some of the strongest opposition. Allen topped the county's batting averages and came second in bowling.<ref>Swanton, pp. 172<U+2013>73.</ref> The MCC team for Australia was chosen in several stages with input from Allen.<ref>Swanton, pp. 167<U+2013>68.</ref> Larwood was not considered; he had spoken out in the press against Australia and opponents of Bodyline, and like Voce, had not played a Test since the 1932<U+2013>33 series.<ref>Swanton, pp. 154<U+2013>55.</ref> The selectors wished to include Voce but Allen threatened to resign were he to be included. Allen met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline. He was therefore named in the touring team.<ref>Swanton, pp. 167<U+2013>71.</ref>

===Tour of Australia, 1936<U+2013>37===
[[File:Allen bowling to McCabe.jpg|thumb|upright|Allen bowling to Stan McCabe during the first Test|300px|alt=A cricketer has just bowled a ball towards a batsman, who is waiting for the ball to arrive]]
A large number of journalists accompanied the English players for the 1936<U+2013>37 series.<ref>Swanton, p. 175.</ref> The inexperience of the tour manager, Rupert Howard, and Allen's vice-captain, [[Walter Robins]], left Allen with a heavy workload.<ref>Swanton, p. 174.</ref> In his end-of-tour report to the MCC, he suggested that the busy schedule of social engagements undertaken by MCC captains had an adverse effect on their form.<ref>Swanton, p. 206.</ref> In the early part of the tour, Allen selected the team by himself, but later used Robins, [[Bob Wyatt]], [[Wally Hammond]] and [[Maurice Leyland]] as a selection committee.<ref name=Wis38>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154075.html| title = England in Australia, 1936<U+2013>37| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1938 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 18 April 2013}}</ref> According to Allen, he had been told before the tour by [[Stanley Jackson]], the chairman of selectors, that he could only use Robins and Wyatt, the other amateurs in the team, as tour selectors; Allen wanted to use Hammond and Leyland but Jackson refused to compromise. Instead, Allen said he would act as the only selector and once the team arrived in Australia, beyond Jackson's influence, he appointed his own unofficial selection panel.<ref>Marshall, pp. 114<U+2013>15.</ref>

The team was hampered throughout by injuries<U+2014>at one point, seven of the sixteen players were unfit.<ref name=Wis38/> As Robins and Wyatt were among the early injured, Allen had to play more often than would otherwise have been the case.<ref>Swanton, p. 179.</ref> He played well in the early weeks of the tour, but the team's results were poor as players struggled to adapt to the Australian conditions. When the Test series began, Australia were clear favourites.<ref>Swanton, pp. 179<U+2013>80.</ref> In the first Test, in reply to England's first innings of 358, Australia were bowled out for 234. When England batted again, the captain top-scored with 68, and the innings he later he rated the best of his career. England made 256 and, on a pitch affected by rain, Allen took five for 36 as Australia were bowled out for 58 to lose by 322 runs.<ref>Swanton, pp. 181<U+2013>82.</ref> Allen's team also won the second Test. England scored 426 for six on the first two days before rain prompted Allen to declare. On a damaged pitch, Allen took four for 10 and Australia were bowled out for 80. They made 324 following-on but still lost by an innings.<ref>Swanton, pp. 184<U+2013>85.</ref> During the second Australian innings, Bradman, the Australian captain, who went on to score 82, was dropped when he had scored 24 by Robins. The latter apologised, but Allen replied: "Oh, forget it, old boy, it's probably cost us the rubber, but what the hell!"<ref name=S186>Swanton, p. 186.</ref>

During the third Test, rain affected play. On the second day, Australia declared having scored 200 for nine in their first innings. In reply, England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch became almost impossible to bat on. Several critics, including members of his own team, suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult. Allen considered the risk to be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine.<ref>Swanton, pp. 188<U+2013>90.</ref> Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the batting conditions eased. He and [[Jack Fingleton]] shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket; Bradman scored 270 and England were defeated by 365 runs.<ref>Swanton, pp. 190<U+2013>91.</ref> As one problem facing England had been the lack of a stable opening partnership, for the fourth Test Allen promoted [[Hedley Verity]], who was not a specialist batsman, to open with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]]. The move was moderately successful as they shared an opening stand of over 50 runs.<ref>Swanton, pp. 193<U+2013>95.</ref> Australia were bowled out for 288 in their first innings, when several of Allen's tactical moves worked well. England replied with 330, and Australia scored 433 in the second innings. Needing to score 392 to win, England were bowled out for 243, and the series was level at 2<U+2013>2.<ref>Swanton, pp. 193<U+2013>96.</ref>

Allen, complaining of exhaustion,<ref name=Sw198/> and struggling with an injury,<ref name=Wis38/> rested from the MCC's next tour game. He was criticised for this, including by Warner, particularly when the team lost in his absence. Allen also proposed that he miss the final Test, but the other selectors insisted he play.<ref name=Sw198>Swanton, pp. 198<U+2013>99.</ref> Australia chose [[Laurie Nash]], a fast bowler, for the game and Allen, concerned over the possible use of Bodyline by Australia, spoke to Bradman before the game.<!-- Check this against Frith. I think there may be more to it than this, and the threat may have been more explicit. --><ref>Swanton, p. 199.</ref> Struggling with a leg injury, Allen was below his best.<ref name=Wis38/> Australia won the toss, scored 604 and, assisted by rain, bowled England out for 239 and 165 to win the match and series.<ref>Swanton, pp. 199<U+2013>201.</ref> Allen was bitterly disappointed, and believed that England missed an opportunity to win the fourth Test. Nevertheless, the series was followed extremely closely and watched by over 900,000 people in total; the MCC took home a larger profit than on any previous tour.<ref>Swanton, p. 202.</ref> Allen was treated sympathetically by press and public,<ref name=Wis38/><ref>Swanton, p. 203.</ref> The ''Wisden'' review of the tour suggested: "It would be churlish to criticise Allen's captaincy. During the first two Tests, almost every one of his moves succeeded instantly&nbsp;... No doubt, Allen had studied his opponents carefully and knew their weaknesses, and if his tactics were not always dictated by accepted principles they certainly proved very successful. Those who attributed so much of the England captain's success to good luck were inclined to overlook the many stratagems exploited by him".<ref name=Wis38/> In the Test series, he scored 150 runs at 18.75 and took 17 wickets at 30.94.<ref name=tbat/><ref name=tbowl/> During the tour, Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and he encouraged his team to fraternise with Australia.<ref>Swanton, pp. 197<U+2013>98.</ref> However, he clashed over tactics with one of his team, [[Joe Hardstaff, Jr.|Joe Hardstaff]], whom he wished to bat more slowly; the pair never subsequently got along.<ref>Marshall, pp. 115<U+2013>16.</ref>

The team played three games in New Zealand before returning home via America; Allen left the team early and spent time in Hollywood.<ref>Swanton, pp. 206<U+2013>07.</ref> In all first-class games, Allen scored 380 runs at 25.33 and took 38 wickets at 26.23.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

==Later career==
===Before the war===
A combination of fatigue from the Australian tour and his need to return to work reduced the amount of cricket Allen played in 1937,<ref>Swanton, p. 204.</ref> and he announced his unavailability for the summer's Test series against New Zealand.<ref>Swanton, p. 208.</ref> He played just four first-class games that season, scored 161 runs and took 15 wickets.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> When the following season began, he remained in contention for the England captaincy for the 1938 Ashes series. However, Wally Hammond, formerly a professional, became an amateur before the season and became another candidate.<ref>Swanton, p. 211.</ref> Allen played several times in the early season for MIddlesex and performed well with bat and ball, but injured his back. Even so, he was selected to captain "the Rest" against England in a Test trial, but was annoyed that Hammond was preferred as captain of the England team, particularly as Warner had not discussed the matter with him. In the event, Allen withdrew on the grounds of fitness,<ref name=S211>Swanton, pp. 211<U+2013>12.</ref> and did not play again for over a month.<ref name=figures/><ref name=S211/> When he returned, his form was good but a succession of injuries plagued him for the rest of the season.<ref>Swanton, pp. 212<U+2013>13.</ref> In 13 first-class games, Allen scored 431 runs, with a highest score of 64, at an average of 26.93.<ref name=fcbatting/> He also took 23 wickets at 25.00.<ref name=fcbowling/> In July 1938, Allen was commissioned in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a second lieutenant. He joined the [[City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders)|City of London Yeomanry ]] along with several friends and colleagues, and this took up much of his time in 1938 and 1939.<ref>Swanton, pp. 213<U+2013>14.</ref> He had time for five first-class games in 1939, scoring 164 runs and taking 16 wickets,<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> before he was called up to the regular army on 24 August 1939.<ref>Swanton, p. 215.</ref>

===War service===
As Allen's regiment was part of the [[Royal Artillery]], and he quickly became involved with [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] and began to associate with [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) officers.<ref>Swanton, pp. 214<U+2013>16.</ref> In 1940, he was appointed as an Anti-Aircraft (AA) liaison officer to [[RAF Hawkinge]], part of an initiative to share intelligence on German AA operations with [[bomber]] groups; these posts were controlled by a branch of Military Intelligence, [[MI14]]E.<ref>Swanton, pp. 216<U+2013>17.</ref> Later that year, Allen's brother Geoffrey was killed fighting in France.<ref>Swanton, pp. 218<U+2013>19.</ref>

By June 1940, Allen was appointed as a [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]] liaison officer to [[No. 5 Group RAF|FIve Group]], an [[RAF Bomber Command]] group, responsible for distributing intelligence on German air defences collated by MI14 to bomber stations. Through this position, Allen became friends with [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur "Bomber" Harris]] who commanded Five Group at the time. As part of his work there, Allen accompanied one bombing mission to the [[Ruhr]], to gain first hand experience of AA defences.<ref>Swanton, p. 220.</ref> In December, Allen was appointed to lead the MI14E section which collated AA intelligence; aside from appointing flak liaison officers, Allen received sensitive intelligence data from a variety of sources on German air defences.<ref>Swanton, pp. 221<U+2013>22.</ref> He remained in this position for the rest of the war, being promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] when MI14E became [[MI15]]. He also found time to play regular charity cricket matches, which took place throughout the war although they were not first-class, including several at Lord's.<ref>Swanton, pp. 223<U+2013>29.</ref> He was demobbed in July 1945.<ref>Swanton, p. 228.</ref>

===Final years===
After the war, Allen dedicated most of his time to his stockbroking work and was made a partner by David Bevan and Co.<ref>Swanton, p. 230.</ref> This left little time for cricket, although he appeared twice for Middlesex in 1946.<ref name=figures/><ref>Swanton, p. 231.</ref> The following season, he played just once for Middlesex,<ref name=figures/> and instead captained their second team. He also played twice for the [[Free Foresters Cricket Club|Free Foresters]] in first-class games.<ref name=figures/><ref>Swanton, p. 232.</ref> Late in the 1947 season, Allen was asked to captain and manage an MCC team which was to tour the West Indies that winter. Aware of his age and limited fitness, Allen accepted but planned to lead mainly from the sidelines. However, a young and experimental team suffered badly with injuries; Allen missed several matches himself through strains.<ref>Swanton, pp. 233<U+2013>34.</ref> In first-class games, he scored 262 runs and took six wickets,<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> but writing in ''Wisden'', Norman Preston judged: "Allen was too old."<ref>{{Cite web| last=Preston| first= Norman| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152899.html| title = MCC in West Indies, 1947<U+2013>48| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1949 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 13 May 2013}}</ref> Allen also clashed with several members of his team; he did not get along with [[Ken Cranston]], his vice-captain, nor Joe Hardstaff, his senior professional. When Allen tried to impose discipline on the team to prevent his players staying out late to drink alcohol, neither Cranston nor Hardstaff backed him.<ref>Marshall, p. 154.</ref>

With many players indisposed and his options limited, Allen requested reinforcements and the MCC sent out [[Len Hutton]]; in the meantime, Allen asked [[Billy Griffith|S. C. Griffith]], not a highly regarded batsman, to open the batting for England in the second Test. Griffith responded by batting the entire first day and scoring 140 runs in total, his maiden century in first-class cricket.<ref>Swanton, pp. 235<U+2013>36.</ref> The first two Tests were drawn, but West Indies won the last two to win the series; the MCC team did not win a single match on the tour. Allen later regretted accepting the invitation.<ref>Swanton, pp. 234<U+2013>40.</ref> In three Tests, he scored 94 run and took five wickets.<ref name=tbat/><ref name=tbowl/> Allen did not play any more Test cricket; in 25 matches, he scored 750 runs at an average of 24.19 and took 81 wickets at 29.37.<ref name=Cricinfo>{{cite web|title=Sir Gubby Allen (Cricinfo profile)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8515.html| publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>

Although Allen appeared four times for Middlesex in 1948 most of his remaining cricket was played for the Free Foresters against Cambridge University. On very good batting pitches, the matches lacked a competitive edge, but in 12 games between 1948 and his retirement, he scored four centuries and averaged over 80 with the bat. In 1948, he scored 180 in the fixture, the highest score of his career; in combination with his success in Middlesex matches, he finished on top of the English batting averages that season.<ref>Swanton, pp. 242<U+2013>43.</ref> He played his final Middlesex games in 1950, captaining the team in four matches in the absence of the regular captain,<ref>Swanton, p. 248.</ref> and made his final first-class appearance for the Free Foresters in 1954.<ref name=figures/> In all first-class cricket, he scored 9,233 runs at an average of 28.67 and took 788 wickets at 22.23.<ref name=Cricinfo/>

==Cricketing technique==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F6CE |salign=left| quote =He bowls really fast, with an action answering to classical requirements, sideways on, left shoulder seen momentarily by the batsman, then a strong urgent swing over, after a run to attack that is sturdy and galloping and not too long.|source = [[Neville Cardus]]<ref name=Keating>Quoted in {{Cite news | last = Keating| first = Frank| title = Who<U+2019>s fit to play Gubby the gent?| newspaper = The Guardian  | location = London  | page =  19  | date = 26 August 1982}}</ref>|align=right| width=300px}}
Allen was capable of bowling unusually quickly. Critics judged him to have an excellent [[bowling action]],<ref name=obit>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155342.html| title =Gubby Allen (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1990 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 29 January 2014}}</ref> through which he achieved his pace.<ref name=ODNB/> He bowled from sideways on,<ref name=S148/> and according to 'his ''Wisden'' obituary, had "a rhythmical run-up and full follow-through".<ref name=obit/> [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]] described Allen in 1943: "Of no more than medium height, he has a solid yet elastic strength, every unit of which is used in the delivery and in a follow-through which is the finest I have ever seen."<ref name=RG67>Robertson-Glasgow, p. 67.</ref> Robertson-Glasgow continued: "His bowling, thought it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous irrelevance, has often touched greatness."<ref name=RG67/> Although opposed to Bodyline tactics in Australia, Allen often bowled short to intimidate batsmen in county cricket<U+2014>for example, he once struck Wyatt over the heart with a fast ball.<ref>Marshall, p. 16.</ref><ref>Douglas, pp. 133, 135.</ref>

[[File:Allen bowling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Allen bowling in 1932|alt=A cricketer pictured just after having bowled the ball]]
During the early part of his career, Allen was often in competition, both for a place in the England team and in terms of press judgements, with Larwood. Swanton suggests that, had he played regularly, Allen may have matched the achievements of Larwood.<ref name=S103/> Other critics had reservations. Alan Gibson, in his study of England captains, writes that Allen "was a fast bowler, not quite of the highest class"; he notes that Allen became more accurate in where he pitched the ball as he got older, but this was offset by a loss of pace.<ref name=G169>Gibson, p. 169.</ref> Robertson-Glasgow believed that Allen suffered from not bowling regularly. He observed that his most successful Test bowling came in Australia, when he had the opportunity to gradually build himself up to form. When called upon to play when out of practice, he often "bowled wildly or inconsistently".<ref>Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 66<U+2013>67.</ref> He concluded: "In his early days he was perhaps too easily depressed by failure. But years brought the philosophic mind, and he learned that bowlers must either laugh or leave the game for ever. And he does a deal of laughing."<ref name=RG67/> Woodcock and Robertson-Glasgow believed that, in this period, only Larwood was capable of bowling more devastating spells of fast bowling than Allen among English bowlers.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=RG67/>

As a batsman, Allen's was technically sound. Robertson-Glasgow described him as a "correct, strong and courageous" batsman who "has many a time, so to speak, saved the legs of an innings when the head and body have collapsed. Like most Etonian cricketers, he is best at greatest need."<ref name=RG67/> Gibson describes him as a "hard-hitting batsman in the middle of the order".<ref name=G169/> In later years, his understanding of batting technique enabled him to co-write the MCC coaching book.<ref name=obit/> Gibson describes Allen as an unlucky captain, affected by injuries and poor selection, who had little opportunity to lead teams. He judged him to be an orthodox tactician, possibly influenced by the fact that his two predecessors, Jardine and Wyatt, often strayed into highly unusual tactics. Gibson states that Allen was popular with his teams and that his influence during the potentially difficult Australia tour of 1936<U+2013>37 was crucial.<ref>Gibson, pp. 169<U+2013>70.</ref> Wyatt rated him as a good captain, and stated: "As a captain, he was a disciplinarian but was always most considerate to the members of his side".<ref name=obit/>

==Administrative career==
Clive Taylor, writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper in 1959, suggested: "Rightly or wrongly most of the men connected with cricket today would regard G. O. "Gubby" Allen as the dictator of English cricket."<ref>{{Cite news | last = Taylor| first = Clive| title = G. O. "Gubby" Allen| newspaper = The Observer  | location = London  | page =  31  | date = 22 March 1959}}</ref>
Gibson, writing in 1979, described Allen as "a patriarchal, though not aloof, figure at Lord's".<ref name=G169/> [[Ian Peebles]], a team-mate of Allen's at Middlesex and later a journalist, said of him: "Allen's impact [as an administrator at Lord's] was immediate and it was the foundation of a remarkable career in the course of which he was to initiate and sponsor measures which affected every possible aspect of the game."<ref name=Keating/> Allen's ''Wisden'' obituary stated: "[He] had a stronger influence on the welfare and development of cricket than anyone since Lord Harris [who died in 1932] over a period of more than 50 years."<ref name=obit/>

===After the Second World War===
In the final stages of his playing career, Allen became increasingly influential off the field. After the war, he once more served on the MCC Committee. One of his first actions, prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour<!-- when Hutton commented that although playing for the MCC he was unable to wear the MCC colours as he was not a member -->, was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers.<ref>Swanton, p. 244.</ref> He also clashed with Pelham Warner over the appointment of the influential MCC treasurer; Swanton suggests that Warner may have resented Allen's rise, and that the pair's relationship never recovered from their disagreement over the England captaincy in 1938.<ref>Swanton, pp. 244<U+2013>45.</ref>

Allen was heavily involved an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s. Allen later recalled travelling home around 1950 and seeing a group of boys playing cricket enthusiastically but with little technical skill. He decided that something needed to be done, and raised the point at a meeting of the MCC Committee.<ref name=Keating2>{{Cite news | last = Keating| first = Frank| title = Who<U+2019>s fit to play Gubby the gent?| newspaper = The Guardian  | location = London  | page =  19  | date = 26 August 1982}}</ref> Unlike many of the cricketing establishment and press, who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority, Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and those boys who did not have access to top-class facilities.<ref name=youth>Quelch, "At last the 1948 show", Location 673.</ref> In 1951, the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association, of which Allen was a member. Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC Coaching book in 1951, aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country. Allen worked in collaboration with [[Harry Altham]]; Allen was responsible for the technical aspects of the publication.<ref>Swanton, pp. 248<U+2013>49.</ref> In later years, Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator.<ref name=Keating2/> However, in his survey of English cricket in the 1950s, Tim Quelch states that the scheme, and other similar initiatives at the time, achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached in this way had little actual opportunity to play cricket.<ref name=youth/>

===Test selector===
In July 1954, Allen was involved in the selection of the MCC team to [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954<U+2013>55|tour Australia in 1954<U+2013>55]], as the MCC's representative. That winter, Allen travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts. He was present when England won three Test matches which ensured victory in the series, but disliked the slow rate at which the team bowled their overs.<ref>Swanton, pp. 252<U+2013>53.</ref> Before the 1955 season, he was nominated as the Chairman of Selectors, and as his senior partner at David Bevan had no objection, he accepted. The workload of the post brought his playing days to an end.<ref>Swanton, p. 254.</ref>

Allen served as chairman from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain.<ref>Swanton, p. 255.</ref> Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship and good fielding, but he first impressed upon the team the importance of bowling overs more quickly.<ref>Swanton, pp. 256<U+2013>57.</ref> While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; of these, several emerged in this period, including [[Peter May]] and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and were part of a strong English batting line-up.<ref>Marshall, pp. 185<U+2013>86.</ref> However, at least one member of the team, [[Jim Laker]], resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were actually paid more for playing than the professionals.<ref name=Marshall/><ref>Marshall, 253<U+2013>54.</ref> Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place;<ref>{{cite web|last=Steen|first=Rob|title=Dolly Mixture|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/358080.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo; first published in the ''Wisden Cricketer''|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of [[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]] for reasons of class<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Jackson (obituary)|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550077/Les-Jackson.html|publisher=Telegraph online|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=30 April 2007}}</ref> Allen also played the role of disciplinarian; several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life and often ignored attempts to impose discipline. It was often left to Allen to issue warnings. Additionally, he often spoke to the press during the English season.<ref name=Marshall>Marshall, pp. 193<U+2013>96.</ref> He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, and discussing tactics with the captain.<ref>Marshall, p. 201.</ref> In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship.<ref>Swanton, pp. 257<U+2013>58.</ref> When May was absent from the team with illness in 1960 and part of 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.<ref>Swanton, pp. 269<U+2013>70.</ref> 

Allen and May's first series in control resulted in a 3<U+2013>2 win over South Africa.<ref>Swanton, pp. 258<U+2013>60.</ref> In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 3<U+2013>1. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed for the inclusion of [[Cyril Washbrook]], who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years.<ref name=Sw1956/> The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by [[Bill Bowes]], a former England team-mate, for forcing one of the England team, [[Fred Trueman]], to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the "establishment" intended to keep him in his place.<ref>Quelch, "Look Back in Anger", Location 4056.</ref> Washbrook was ultimately successful, and England won the match. In the fourth game, [[David Sheppard]], who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test [[Denis Compton]] was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94.<ref name=Sw1956>Swanton, pp. 261<U+2013>64.</ref> The ''Wisden'' editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: "I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [the selectors] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was too much trouble for them."<ref>{{Cite web| last=Preston| first= Norman| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152625.html | title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1957 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 20 May 2013}}</ref> Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to give a lot of assistance to spin bowlers, which allowed Laker to be extremely successful. Allen denied any involvement.<ref>Swanton, pp. 263<U+2013>64.</ref> Writing 23 years later, Alan Gibson judged this to have been Allen's most successful committee as chairman of selectors.<ref name=G170>Gibson, p. 170.</ref> During the winter, Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket.<ref>Swanton, p. 265.</ref>

England won the 1957 Test series against the West Indies 3<U+2013>0 and the 1958 series against New Zealand 4<U+2013>0.<ref>Swanton, pp. 265<U+2013>67.</ref> But despite having what was regarded as a strong team, England lost 4<U+2013>0 in Australia in 1958<U+2013>59.<ref>{{Cite web| last=Gee| first= Harry| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152700.html | title = M.C.C. team in Australia and New Zealand, 1958<U+2013>59| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1960 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 20 May 2013}}</ref><ref>Swanton, p. 267.</ref> The team was more successful afterwards, beating India 5<U+2013>0 in 1959,<ref>Swanton, p. 269.</ref> defeating West Indies 1<U+2013>0 in 1959<U+2013>60 and South Africa 3<U+2013>0 in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155245.html| title = M.C.C. team in West Indies, 1959<U+2013>60| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1961 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 20 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152721.html| title = South Africans in England, 1960| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1961 | publisher = John Wisden & Co | location = London |accessdate = 20 May 2013}}</ref> Allen's final series as chairman was against Australia in 1961; England lost after making tactical mistakes in the fourth Test, when they did not follow the plan conceived by May and Allen at the start of the final day.<ref>Swanton, pp. 272<U+2013>73.</ref>

===Influence behind the scenes===
In 1956, Allen became chairman of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing the size of the ball would help bowlers. <ref>Swanton, pp. 275<U+2013>76.</ref> Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Many critics felt that several Australian bowlers in the 1958<U+2013>59 series [[Throwing (cricket)|threw]] rather than bowled the ball; three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. When [[Geoff Griffin]], who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action, Allen watched him closely and filmed him. When the bowler was [[No ball|no-balled]] for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part.<ref>Swanton, pp. 270<U+2013>71, 276<U+2013>77</ref> The throwing issue was to be debated at a meeting of the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]], but Allen met Donald Bradman, Australia's representative, beforehand. The pair discussed the issue, and came to a mutual understanding.<!-- This is horrendous, but I can't think of a better way to say it yet. More sources needed --> The Conference agreed to address the throwing issue, and when Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in the team.<ref name=obit/><ref>Swanton, p. 278.</ref>

When the MCC abolished amateur status in cricket in 1962, making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change.<ref>Swanton, p. 280.</ref> In 1963, he was appointed as MCC President.<ref>Swanton, p. 281.</ref> Among his first actions were to approve more frequent tours by the West Indies team following their popular and successful series in 1963.<ref>Swanton, pp. 281<U+2013>83.</ref> When his one-year term-of-office ended in late 1964, he was appointed MCC treasurer,<ref>Swanton, pp. 284<U+2013>85.</ref> a position he filled until 1976.<ref name=ODNB/> During his time as MCC treasurer, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of the treasurer and trustee. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968.<ref>Swanton, pp. 286<U+2013>87.</ref> He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that cricket be more democratically organised, and not just run by a private members club, to receive financial support from the government. Allen and Billy Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, a new [[Test and County Cricket Board]] and a National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC,<ref>Swanton, pp. 287<U+2013>88.</ref> and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.<ref>Swanton, pp. 293<U+2013>94.</ref>

Allen was prosperous by this stage of his life. His earnings on the Stock Exchange left him comfortably affluent, and an inheritance when his mother died in 1962 helped him further. His knowledge of Australian markets was respected in the City and by the mid-1960s, several of his investments in that country came to fruition and guaranteed his financial future.<ref>Swanton, p. 279.</ref> In 1965, Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years; he believed that his fast bowling may have brought about his hip problems.<ref>Swanton, p. 286.</ref>

===The D'Oliveira Affair===
{{Main|D'Oliveira affair}}
In 1968, the MCC was involved in controversy over the non-selection of [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to tour South Africa. The South African government, which at the time followed the policy of [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]], did not want D'Oliveira in the England team on the grounds of his colour.<ref>Oborne, pp. 145<U+2013>46.</ref> The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but they wanted the tour to go ahead.<ref>Swanton, p. 288.</ref> The club sent a letter to the South African Cricket Association which sought to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team.<ref>Oborne, p. 137.</ref> The South African Prime Minister, [[B. J. Vorster]] did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances, but he wished to hide the fact and delay as long as possible.<ref>Oborne, pp. 146<U+2013>47.</ref> Subsequently, Allen and the MCC Committee accepted the advice of the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], then [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and member of the MCC Committee, [[Alec Douglas-Home]]. He visited South Africa in January 1968 and after meeting Vorster, suggested that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, but that it was likely no protest would be made.<ref name=S289>Swanton, p. 289.</ref> After this, the MCC altered their tactics from wanting an answer to their earlier letter, to Allen refusing to take receipt of the official reply when it was sent to him. According to Peter Oborne, in his biography of D'Oliveira, Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith, wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions, and from this point, the pair "were running a private, unaccountable, secret policy of their own".<ref>Oborne, pp. 148<U+2013>49.</ref>

In March 1968, [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]], an MCC member who wanted the tour to go ahead,<ref>Oborne, p. 152.</ref> also met Vorster, who told him that D'Oliveira would not be an acceptable selection to the South African government. Cobham communicated this information to an MCC Committee member by private letter. Only Allen, Griffith and the then-President [[Arthur Gilligan]] were aware of the letter, but they chose to keep its contents from the rest of the Committee.<ref name=S289/> Allen's justification was the Douglas-Home, a statesman and former Prime Minister, had given advice which contradicted this; also, other Committee members were Test selectors and Allen believed that the information would place non-cricketing pressures on their choices for the England team.<ref>Swanton, p. 290.</ref> Oborne suggests that Douglas-Home's advice was made redundant by Cobham's letter, and that Allen's supposed desire to protect the other selectors was "preposterous" as the tour would have been cancelled.<ref>Oborne, pp. 154<U+2013>55.</ref> Oborne suggests that these actions were exactly what Vorster hoped: that the South African government had applied no official pressure, but that the MCC were aware that if D'Oliveira were selected, the tour would not proceed.<ref>Oborne, p. 155.</ref>

When the English selectors met to choose the team, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC; they had no official say in the selection, but had a power of veto over any choice. Although Allen did not use this veto, Oborne suggests that he had made it clear that he considered D'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on a cricketing basis.<ref>Oborne, pp. 193<U+2013>94.</ref> D'Oliveira was eventually left out, to enormous anger and controversy. When he was later added to the team when another player was injured, Vorster protested and the tour was cancelled.<ref>Oborne, pp. 201<U+2013>28.</ref> When some of the events leading up to D'Oliveira's exclusion became public knowledge the following year, the MCC came under enormous public pressure, and the press called for Allen to resign.<ref>Swanton, p. 291.</ref> Oborne suggests that Allen, although not a supporter of Apartheid, wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa; he regarded opponents of Apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment.<ref>Oborne, p. 212.</ref>

In 1970, the proposed visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC was no longer solely responsible for any decisions, being only a part of the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities. The Cricket Council wished the tour to go ahead, believing it was the best way to promote multi-racial sport in South Africa and that cricket should go on as usual. In the end, the government asked the Council to cancel the tour.<ref>Swanton, pp. 292<U+2013>93.</ref>

===Final years===
Allen retired from the Stock Exchange in 1972, resigned as MCC treasurer in 1976 and left the Cricket Council in 1982.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1962, he was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1986.<ref name=ODNB/> In 1968, Allen moved to a flat directly behind the Pavilion at Lord's,<ref>Swanton, pp. 291<U+2013>92.</ref> where he lived until his death.<ref name=ODNB/> Following his retirement, he spent much of his time in the MCC Committee room, watching cricket at Lord's.<ref name=ODNB/> He died at home on 29 November 1989,<ref name=ODNB/> suffering from the effects of a stomach operation earlier in the year.<ref name=Cricinfo>{{cite web|title=Sir Gubby Allen Player Profile|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8515.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>
