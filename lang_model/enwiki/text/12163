'''Therav<U+0101>da''' is the oldest surviving branch of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Sherab Chodzin Kohn. ''A Life of the Buddha'', p149-p150. Shambhala Publications, 1993.</ref> The word is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[sthaviravada]]'', and literally means "the Teaching of the Elders". It is relatively conservative, and according to [[Rupert Gethin|Dr. Rupert Gethin]], it is closer to early Buddhism than other existing Buddhist traditions.<ref>Gethin, Rupert. ''The Foundations of Buddhism'', p1. Oxford University Press, 1998.</ref>

Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism is followed by various countries and people around the globe, and are:
*In [[South Asia]]:
**[[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] (by 70% of the population)
**[[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] (by 0.7% of the population)

*In [[Southeast Asia]]:
**[[Buddhism in Cambodia|Cambodia]] (by 95% of the population)
**[[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]] (by 67% of the population)
**[[Buddhism in Burma|Myanmar]] (by 89% of the population)
**[[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]] (by 95% of the population)

*In other parts of [[Asia]]:

*Therav<U+0101>da has also recently gained popularity in the [[Western Buddhism|Western world]].

Today, Therav<U+0101>da Buddhists, otherwise known as Theravadins, number over 150 million worldwide, and during the past few decades Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism has begun to [[Vipassana movement|take root in the West]]{{refn|group=lower-alpha|John Bullit: "In the last century, however, the West has begun to take notice of Therav<U+0101>da's unique spiritual legacy and teachings of Awakening.

==History==

===Origins===
The name Therav<U+0101>da comes from the ancestral [[Sthaviravada]], from which the Theravadins claim descent. After unsuccessfully trying to modify the [[Vinaya]], a small group of "elderly members", i.e. ''sthaviras'', broke away from the majority [[Mah<U+0101>s<U+0101><U+1E43>ghika]] during the [[Second Buddhist council]], giving rise to the Sthaviravada.<ref>Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 49, 64</ref> According to its own accounts, the Therav<U+0101>da school is fundamentally derived from the [[Vibhajjavada|Vibhajjav<U+0101>da]] (or "doctrine of analysis") grouping<ref>See "On the Vibhajjav<U+0101>dins", Lance Cousins, Buddhist Studies Review 18, 2 (2001)</ref> which was a division of the Sthaviravada.

Theravadin accounts of its own origins mention that it received the teachings that were agreed upon during the [[Third Buddhist Council]] under the patronage of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka]], around 250 BCE. These teachings were known as the Vibhajjavada.<ref>Hirakawa Akira (translated and edited by Paul Groner), ''A History Of India Buddhism'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 1993, page 109.</ref> The Vibhajjav<U+0101>dins in turn split into four groups: the [[Mahisasaka|Mah<U+012B><U+015B><U+0101>saka]], [[K<U+0101><U+015B>yap<U+012B>ya]], [[Dharmaguptaka]], and the T<U+0101>mrapar<U+1E47><U+012B>ya.

The Therav<U+0101>da is descended from the T<U+0101>mrapar<U+1E47><U+012B>ya sect, which means "the Sri Lankan lineage." In the 7th century CE, Chinese pilgrims [[Xuanzang]] and [[I Ching (monk)|Yijing]] refer to the Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka as ''Sh<U+00E0>ngzu<U+00F2>b<U+00F9>'' (Ch. <U+4E0A><U+5EA7><U+90E8>), corresponding to the Sanskrit "Sthavira Nik<U+0101>ya" and the Pali "Thera Nik<U+0101>ya."{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Hiuen Tsiang refers to the Buddhists in Sri Lanka as "They principally follow the teaching of Buddha, according to the dharma of the Sthavira (Shang-tso-pu) school".<ref>Samuel Beal, "Si-Yu-Ki&nbsp;<U+2014> Buddhist Records of the Western World&nbsp;<U+2014> Translated from the Chinese of Hiuen Tsiang AD 629", published by Tuebner and Co, London (1884), reprint by the Oriental Book Reprint Corporation, New Delhi, (1983), Digital version: Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies, Taipei.</ref>}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|I-tsing refers to the situation in Sri Lanka as "In Ceylon the Sthavira school alone flourishes; the Mahasanghikas are expelled"<ref>Samuel Beal, "The Life of Hiuen-Tsiang: By the Shaman Hwui Li. With an introduction containing an account of the works of I-tsing", published by Tuebner and Co, London (1911), Digital version: University of Michigan.</ref>}} The school has been using the name ''Therav<U+0101>da'' for itself in a written form since at least the 4th century, when the term appears in the ''[[Dipavamsa|D<U+012B>pava<U+1E41>sa]]''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|It is used in the Dipavamsa (quoted in ''Debates Commentary'', Pali Text society, page 4), which is generally dated to the 4th century.}}

===Transmission to Sri Lanka===
According to Buddhist scholar [[A.K. Warder]], the Therav<U+0101>da 
{{quote|... spread rapidly south from [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] into [[Maharastra]] and [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and down to the Chola country ([[Kanchi]]), as well as [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. For some time they maintained themselves in Avanti as well as in their new territories, but gradually they tended to regroup themselves in the south, the Great Vihara (Mahavihara) in [[Anuradhapura]], the capital of Ceylon, becoming the main centre of their tradition, Kanchi a secondary center and the northern regions apparently relinquished to other schools.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=278}}}}

According  to the P<U+0101>li chronicles of the Sinhalese tradition, Buddhism was first brought to Sri Lanka by Arahant [[Mahinda]], who is believed to have been the son of the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Asoka]], in the third century BCE, as a part of the ''dhammaduta'' (missionary) activities of the Asokan era. In Sri Lanka, Arahant Mahinda established the [[Mahavihara|Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra Monastery]] of Anuradhapura.

===Therav<U+0101>da subdivisions===
Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Therav<U+0101>da existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the [[Mahavihara|Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra]], [[Abhayagiri Vih<U+0101>ra]], and the Jetavana Vih<U+0101>ra.<ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280">Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 280</ref> The Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra was the first tradition to be established, while Abhayagiri Vih<U+0101>ra and Jetavana Vih<U+0101>ra were established by monks who had broken away from the Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra tradition.<ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"/> According to A.K. Warder, the Indian Mah<U+012B><U+015B><U+0101>saka sect also established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Therav<U+0101>da, into which they were later absorbed.<ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"/> Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.<ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280"/>

[[Image:Dambulla 16.jpg|thumb|Buddha painting in [[Dambulla cave temple]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. The Buddhist cave-temple complex was established as a Buddhist Monastery in the 3rd century BC.

When the Chinese monk [[Faxian]] visited the island in the early 5th century CE, he noted 5000 monks at Abhayagiri, 3000 monks at the Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra, and 2000 monks at the Cetiyapabbatavih<U+0101>ra.<ref name="Hirakawa, Akira 2007. p. 121">Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From <U+015A><U+0101>kyamuni to Early Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na.'' 2007. p. 121</ref>

===Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na influences===
Over the centuries, the Abhayagiri Therav<U+0101>dins maintained close relations with Indian Buddhists and adopted many new teachings from India.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From <U+015A><U+0101>kyamuni to Early Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na.'' 2007. p. 124</ref> including many elements from [[Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na]] teachings, while the Jetavana Therav<U+0101>dins adopted Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na to a lesser extent.<ref name="Hirakawa, Akira 2007. p. 121"/><ref>Gombrich, Richard Francis. ''Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism: A Social History. 1988. p. 158</ref>

Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Therav<U+0101>da in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the "Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Sthaviras," and the Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra tradition as the "[[Hinayana|H<U+012B>nay<U+0101>na]] Sthaviras."<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53</ref> Xuanzang further writes:<ref name="Hirakawa, Akira 2007. p. 121"/>

{{quote|The Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>rav<U+0101>sins reject the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na and practice the H<U+012B>nay<U+0101>na, while the Abhayagirivih<U+0101>rav<U+0101>sins study both H<U+012B>nay<U+0101>na and Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripi<U+1E6D>aka]]''.}}

Akira Hirakawa notes that the surviving P<U+0101>li commentaries (''[[Atthakatha|{{IAST|A<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>hakath<U+0101>}}]]'') of the Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra school, when examined closely, also include a number of positions that agree with Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na teachings.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From <U+015A><U+0101>kyamuni to Early Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na.'' 2007. p. 257</ref> Kalupahana notes the same for the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', the most important Therav<U+0101>da commentary.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206-208}}

In the 8th century CE, it is known that both Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na and the esoteric [[Vajray<U+0101>na]] form of Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Esoteric Buddhism in China, [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]], visited the island during this time.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From <U+015A><U+0101>kyamuni to Early Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na.'' 2007. pp. 125-126</ref> Abhayagiri Vih<U+0101>ra appears to have been a center for Theravadin Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na and Vajray<U+0101>na teachings.<ref>"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship" by Hiram Woodward. ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), p. 341</ref>

===Abolition of other Therav<U+0101>da traditions===
Some scholars have held that the rulers of Sri Lanka ensured that Therav<U+0101>da remained traditional, and that this characteristic contrasts with Indian Buddhism.<ref>Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, page 187.</ref> However, before the 12th century CE, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiri Therav<U+0101>dins, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiri Therav<U+0101>dins as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From <U+015A><U+0101>kyamuni to Early Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na.'' 2007. p. 125</ref><ref>Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 59</ref>

The trend of Abhayagiri Vihara being the dominant Therav<U+0101>da sect changed in the 12th century CE, when the Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra gained the political support of King [[Parakramabahu I of Sri Lanka|Parakkamab<U+0101>hu I]] (1153<U+2013>1186 CE), and completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavana Therav<U+0101>da traditions.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From <U+015A><U+0101>kyamuni to Early Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na.'' 2007. p. 126</ref><ref name="Williams, Duncan 1999. p. 134">Williams, Duncan. Queen, Christopher. ''American Buddhism: Methods and Findings in Recent Scholarship.'' 1999. p. 134</ref> The Therav<U+0101>da monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently, or attempting re-ordination under the Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra tradition as "novices" (''[[samanera|{{IAST|s<U+0101>ma<U+1E47>era}}]]'').<ref name="Williams, Duncan 1999. p. 134"/><ref>Gombrich, Richard.

{{quote|Though the chronicle says that he reunited the Sangha, this expression glosses over the fact that what he did was to abolish the Abhayagiri and Jetavana Nik<U+0101>yas. He laicized many monks from the Mah<U+0101> Vih<U+0101>ra Nik<U+0101>ya, all the monks in the other two &ndash; and then allowed the better ones among the latter to become novices in the now 'unified' Sangha, into which they would have in due course to be reordained.}}

Parakkamab<U+0101>hu also appointed a [[Sangharaja]], or "King of the Sangha," a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka, assisted by two deputies.<ref name="Gombrich, Richard 1988. p. 159"/>

Regarding the differences between these three Therav<U+0101>da traditions, the ''[[Culavamsa|{{IAST|C<U+016B><U+1E37>ava<U+1E41>sa}}]]'' laments, "Despite the vast efforts made in every way by former kings down to the present day, the [[Bhikkhu]]s turned away in their demeanor from one another and took delight in all kinds of strife."<ref>Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 69</ref>

===Lineage of nuns===
A few years after the arrival of [[Sthavira]] [[Mahinda]], Bhikkhuni [[Sanghamitta]], who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Asoka, came to Sri Lanka.  She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century and in Burma in the 13th. In 429 CE, by request of China's emperor, nuns from [[Anuradhapura]] were sent to China to establish the Nun's Order. The order was then spread to [[Korea]]. In 1996, 11 selected Sri Lankan nuns were ordained fully as [[Bhikkhuni]]s by a team of Therav<U+0101>da monks in concert with a team of Korean Nuns in India. There is disagreement among Therav<U+0101>da [[vinaya]] authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. In the last few years the head of the [[Dambulla]] chapter of the [[Siyam Nikaya]] in Sri Lanka has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns. This has been criticized by other leading figures in the Siyam Nikaya and [[Amarapura Nikaya]], and the governing council of [[Burmese Buddhism]] has declared that there can be no valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.<ref>See the article on this subject in ''Buddhist Studies Review'', 24.2 (2007)</ref>

===Spread to Southeast Asia===
[[Image:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Bagan]], an ancient capital of [[Burma]]. There are more than 2,000 Buddhist temples.

According to ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', a Sri Lankan chronicle, after the conclusion of the [[Third Buddhist Council]], a missionary was also sent to [[Suvannabhumi]] where two monks Sona and Uttara, are said to have proceeded.<ref>''Mahavamsa: The great chronicle of Ceylon'' tr. Wilhelm Geiger. Pali Text Society, 1912, Page 82 and 86</ref> Scholar opinions differ as to where exactly this land of Suvannabhumi is located, but Suvannabhumi is believed to be located somewhere in the area which now includes lower [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Sumatra]] Island.

Before the 12th century, the areas of Thailand, Burma, Laos, and Cambodia were dominated by various Buddhist sects from India, and included the teachings of Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism.<ref name="Sujato, Bhikkhu 2006. p. 72">Sujato, Bhikkhu.

Though there are some early accounts that have been interpreted as Therav<U+0101>da in Burma, the surviving records show that most Burmese Buddhism incorporated Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na, and used Sanskrit rather than Pali.<ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 131"/><ref>[[Huston Smith|Smith, Huston]] & [[Philip Novak|Novak, Philip]].

The [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] and [[Pyu]] were among the earliest people to inhabit Burma. Recent archaeological research at a Pyu settlement in the Samon Valley (around 100&nbsp;km south-east of Bagan) has shown that they had trade links with India from 500-400 BC and with China around 200 BC.<ref>Bob Hudson, ''The Origins of Bagan'', Thesis for University of Sydney,2004, page 95.</ref> Chinese sources which have been dated to around 240 A.D. mention a Buddhist kingdom by the name of Lin-Yang, which some scholars have identified as the ancient [[Pyu]] kingdom of Beikthano<ref>Bob Hudson, ''The Origins of Bagan'', Thesis for University of Sydney,2004, page 36.</ref><ref>Elizabeth Moore, "Interpreting Pyu material culture: Royal chronologies and finger-marked bricks," Myanmar Historical Research Journal, No(13) June 2004, pp.1-57, page 6 & 7.

Available [http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/25/theme/25T6.html]</ref> The Burmese slowly became Therav<U+0101>dan when they came into contact with the Pyu and Mon civilization. The Thais also slowly became Therav<U+0101>dan as they came into contact with the Mon civilization.

Despite its success in Southeast Asia, Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism in China has generally been limited to areas bordering Therav<U+0101>da countries.

{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Vipassana movement}}

In the 19th century began a process of mutual influence of both Asian Theravadins and a western audience interested in ancient wisdom. Especially [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], founders of the [[Theosophical Society]] had a profound role in this process. In Therav<U+0101>da countries a lay vipassana practice developed. From the 1970s on western interest gave way to the growth of the so-called [[Vipassana movement]] in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

====Reaction against western colonialism====
Buddhist revivalism has also reacted against changes in Buddhism caused by colonialist regimes. Western colonialists and Christian missionaries deliberately imposed a particular type of Christian monasticism on Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka and colonies in Southeast Asia, restricting monks' activities to individual purification and temple ministries.<ref>Edmund F. Perry's introduction to Walpola Rahula's ''The Heritage of the Bhikkhu: A Short History of the Bhikkhu in the Educational, Cultural, Social, and Policital Life.'' Grove Press, New York, 1974, page xii.</ref> Prior to British colonial control, monks in both Sri Lanka and Burma had been responsible for the education of the children of lay people, and had produced large bodies of literature. After the British takeover, Buddhist temples were strictly administered and were only permitted to use their funds on strictly religious activities. Christian ministers were given control of the education system and their pay became state funding for missions.<ref>Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, pages 35-36.</ref>

Foreign, especially British, rule had an enervating effect on the [[sangha]].<ref name="Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah 1992, page 28">Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, page 28.</ref> According to [[Walpola Rahula]], Christian missionaries displaced and appropriated the educational, social, and welfare activities of the monks, and inculcated a permanent shift in views regarding the proper position of monks in society through their institutional influence upon the elite.<ref name="Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah 1992, page 28"/> Many monks in post-colonial times have dedicated themselves to undoing these changes.<ref>Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, page 29.</ref> Movements intending to restore Buddhism's place in society have developed in both Sri Lanka and Burma.<ref>Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, ''Buddhism Betrayed?'' The University of Chicago Press, 1992, pages 63-64.</ref>

One consequence of the reaction against western colonialism has been a modernisation of Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism: western elements have been incorporated, and [[meditation]] practice has opened to a lay audience. Modernized forms of Therav<U+0101>dan practice have spread to the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

====Sri Lanka====
{{See also|Buddhism in Sri Lanka}}

In Sri Lanka Theravadins were looking at western culture to find means to revitalize their own tradition. Christian missionaries were threatening the indigenous culture.{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=177-181}} As a reaction to this, Theravadins started to propagate Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism. They were aided by the [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], who were dedicated to the search for wisdom within ancient sources, including Buddhism and the Pali Canon. [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] was one of the Therav<U+0101>da leaders with whom the Theosophists sided. Dharmapala tried to reinstate [[vipassana]], using the [[Visuddhimagga]] and the Pali Canon as a foundation. Dharmapala reached out to the middle classes, offering them religious practice and a religious identity, which were used to withstand the British imperialists. As a result of Dharmapapla's efforts lay practitioners started to practise meditation, which had been reserved for monks.{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=172-197}}

The translation and publication of the [[Pali Canon]] by the [[Pali Text Society]] made the Pali Canon available to a lay audience for the first time in history, not only in the west, but also in the east. Western lay interest in Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism was promoted by the Theosophical Society, and endured until the beginning of the 20th century. During the 1970s interest rose again, leading to a surge of westerners searching for enlightenment, and the republishing of the Pali Canon, first in print, and later on the internet.

With the coming to power in 1851 of King [[Mongkut]], who had been a [[monk]] himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily more centralized and hierarchical, and its links to the state more institutionalized. Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist scripture. Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya|Dhammayuttika]] order of monks.

In the early 1900s, Thailand's [[Ajahn Sao Kantasilo Mahathera]] and his student, [[Mun Bhuridatta]] led the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] revival movement. In the 20th century notable practitioners included [[Ajahn Thate]], [[Ajahn Maha Bua]] and [[Ajahn Chah]].{{sfn|Tiyavanich|1997}} It was later spread globally by Ajahn Mun's students including Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah and several western disciples, among whom the most senior is [[Luang Por]] [[Ajahn Sumedho]].

====Burma====
{{See also|Buddhism in Burma}}

Burmese Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism has had a profound influence on modern vipassana practice, both for lay practitioners in Asia as lay practitioners in the west.

The so-called "New Burmese method" was developed by [[U N<U+0101>rada]] and popularized by his students [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] and [[Nyanaponika Thera]]. Another prominent teacher is [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], a student of Nyanaponika. The New Burmese Method strongly emphasizes vipassana over samatha. It is regarded as a simplification of traditional Buddhist meditation techniques, suitable not only for monks but also for lay-practitioners. The method has been popularized in the west by teachers as [[Joseph Goldstein]], [[Jack Kornfield]], [[Tara Brach]], [[Gil Fronsdal]] and [[Sharon Salzberg]].

The Ledi lineage begins with [[Ledi Sayadaw]].{{sfn|Chapman|2011}} [[S.N. Goenka]] is a well-known teacher in the Ledi-lineage. According to S. N. Goenka, vipassana-techniques are essentially non-[[sectarian]] in character, and have universal application. One need not convert to [[Buddhism]] to practice these styles of meditation. Meditation centers teaching the vipassan<U+0101> popularized by S. N. Goenka exist now in India, Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa.

==Doctrinal differences with other schools==
{{See also|Early Buddhism|Pre-sectarian Buddhism|Early Buddhist schools}}

The [[Sthaviravada]], from which Therav<U+0101>da is derived, differed from other [[early Buddhist schools]] on a variety of teachings,{{sfn|Butt|p=211-217}} which are maintained by the Therav<U+0101>da school.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The differences resulted from the systemization of the Buddhist teachings, which was preserved in the [[Abhidhamma|Abdhidhammas]] of the various schools.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=217}}

The Abhidhamma is "a restatement of the doctrine of the Buddha in strictly formalised language [...] assumed to constitute a consistent system of philosophy".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=288}} Its aim is not the empirical verification of the Buddhist teachings,{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=288}} but "to set forth the correct interpretation of the Buddha's statements in the ''Sutra'' to restate his 'system' with perfect accuracy".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=288}}

===The Arahant is perfect===
The [[Mah<U+0101>s<U+0101><U+1E43>ghika]] believed that [[Arahant]]s could regress, while the Therav<U+0101>da believes that the Arahant has an "incorruptible nature".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=283}}

===Insight is sudden and perfect===
According to the Sthaviravada/Therav<U+0101>da, "progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively - ''anapurva'')".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}} This is reflected in the Therav<U+0101>da-account on the [[Four stages of enlightenment|four levels of attainment]], in which the attainment of the four paths appears suddenly, and the defilements are rooted out at once.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Mahasanghika had the doctrine of ''ekaksana-citt'',  "according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant".{{sfn|Gomez|1991|p=69}} The same stance is taken in [[Ch<U+00E1>n in China#Sudden and gradual enlightenment|Ch<U+00E1>n]], although the Ch<U+00E1>n-school harmonized this point of biew with the need for gradual training after the initial insight. This "gradual training" is expressed in teachings as [[Five Ranks|the Five ranks of enlightenment]], [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]] which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]].}} The same stance is taken in the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]], especially the so-called [[U N<U+0101>rada|"New Burmese Method"]].

===Dharmas===
The commentaries gave a new definition of "a 'principle' or 'element' (''dharma'')":{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=308}}
{{quote|''[D]harmas'' are what have (or 'hold', 'maintain', ''dhr'' is the nearest equivalent in the language to the English 'have') their own own-being (''[[svabhava]]''). It is added that they naturally (''yathasvabhavatas'') have this through conditions (''pratyaya''). The idea is that they are distinct, definable, principles in the constitution of the universe."{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=308-309}}}}

==Teachings==
[[Image:Sermon in the Deer Park depicted at Wat Chedi Liem-KayEss-1.jpeg|thumb|Painting of Buddha's first sermon from [[Wat Chedi Liem]] in Thailand]]

Therav<U+0101>da promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[P<U+0101>li|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis." This doctrine says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, the scriptures of the Theravadin tradition also emphasize heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged.

Therav<U+0101>da orthodoxy takes the [[Visuddhimagga#Seven Stages of Purification|seven stages of purification]] as its basic outline of the path to be followed.

The Therav<U+0101>da Path starts with learning, to be followed by practice, culminating in the realization of Nirvana.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Gombrich writes: "In Ceylonese tradition, Buddhism (the Sasana) has three constituents: learning, practice and realization".{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=150}} In the sequence given by Buddhaghosa in his Visuddhimagga, the sequence of training is sila, samadhi, prajna.}}

====The Three Characteristics====
[[Image:Flickr - don macauley - Wat Chaiwatthanaram.jpg|thumb|[[Wat Chaiwatthanaram]] temple in the old city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] in Thailand.]]

{{Main|Three marks of existence}}

Throughout the Pali-canon two characteristics of all [[sankhara|conditioned phenomena]] and one characteristic of all [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhammas]] are being mentioned. The Therav<U+0101>da tradition has grouped them together. Insight into these three characteristics is the entry to the Buddhist path:
# ''[[Anicca]]'' (impermanence): All conditioned phenomena are subject to change, including physical characteristics, qualities, assumptions, theories, knowledge, etc. Nothing is permanent, because, for something to be permanent, there has to be an unchanging cause behind it. Since all causes are recursively bound together, there can be no ultimate unchanging cause.
# ''[[Dukkha]]'' ([[suffering]]): Craving causes suffering, since what is craved is transitory, changing, and perishing. The craving for impermanent things causes disappointment and sorrow.  There is a tendency to label practically everything in the world, as either "good," "comfortable" or "satisfying;" or "bad", "uncomfortable," and "unsatisfying." Labeling things in terms of like and dislike creates suffering. If one succeeds in giving up the tendency to label things and free himself from the instincts that drive him towards attaining what he himself labels collectively as "liking," he attains the ultimate freedom. The problem, the cause, the solution and the implementation, all of these are within oneself, not outside.
# ''[[Anatta]]'' (not-self): all dhammas lack a fixed, unchanging 'essence'; there is no permanent, essential [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]]. A living being is a composite of the [[five aggregates]] (''khandhas''), which is the physical forms (''rupa''), feelings or sensations (''vedana''), perception (''sanna''), mental formations (''sankhara''), and consciousness (''vinnana''), none of which can be identified as one's Self. From the moment of conception, all entities (including all living beings) are subject to a process of continuous change. A practitioner should, on the other hand, develop and refine his or her mind to a state so as to see through this phenomenon. Truly understanding this counter-intuitive concept of Buddhism requires direct and personal experience. This is given in [[vipassana|vipassana-practice]], closely watching the continuous changes in the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]].<ref>P.A. Payutto (2012), Buddha-Dhamma, Bangkok: Pet & Home Publishing House, ISBN 978-616-7585-10-9, Page 13.</ref>

=====Dukkha - The Four Noble Truths=====
{{Main|Four Noble Truths}}

The Four Noble Truths are described as follows:
# ''Dukkha'' (suffering):  This can be somewhat broadly classified into three categories. Inherent suffering, or the suffering one undergoes in all the worldly activities, what one suffers in day-to-day life: birth, aging, diseases, death, sadness, etc. In short, all that one feels from separating from "loving" attachments and/or associating with "hating" attachments is encompassed into the term. The second class of suffering, called ''Suffering due to Change'', implies that things suffer due to attaching themselves to a momentary state which is held to be "good"; when that state is changed, things are subjected to suffering. The third, termed ''Sankhara Dukkha'', is the most subtle. Beings suffer simply by not realizing that they are mere aggregates with no definite, unchanging identity.
# ''Dukkha Samudaya'' (cause of suffering): Craving, which leads to Attachment and Bondage, is the cause of suffering. Formally, this is termed ''Tanha''. It can be classified into three instinctive drives. ''Kama Tanha'' is the Craving for any pleasurable sense object (which involves sight, sound, touch, taste, smell and mental perceptives). ''Bhava Tanha'' is the Craving for attachment to an ongoing process, which appears in various forms, including the longing for existence. ''Vibhava Tanha'' is the Craving for detachment from a process, which includes non-existence and causes the longing for self-annihilation.
# ''Dukkha Nirodha'' (cessation of suffering): One cannot possibly adjust the whole world to one's taste in order to eliminate suffering and hope that it will remain so forever. This would violate the chief principle of Change. Instead, one adjusts one's own mind through detachment so that the Change, of whatever nature, has no effect on one's peace of mind. Briefly stated, the third Noble Truth implies that elimination of the cause (craving) eliminates the result (suffering). This is inferred in the scriptural quote by The Buddha, 'Whatever may result from a cause, shall be eliminated by the elimination of the cause'.
# ''Dukkha Nirodha Gamini Patipada'' (pathway to freedom from suffering): This is the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]way towards freedom or [[Nirvana]]. The path can roughly be rendered into English as right view, right intention, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration.

====Defilements====
{{Main|Kleshas (Buddhism)}}

In Therav<U+0101>da, the cause of human existence and [[suffering]] (''[[dukkha]]'') is identified as craving (''[[tanha]]''), which carries with it the defilements (''[[kilesa]]s''). Those defilements that bind humans to the cycle of rebirth are classified into a set of ten "[[Fetter (Buddhism)|Fetters]]," while those defilements that impede concentration (''[[samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'') are presented in a fivefold set called the "[[Five Hindrances]]."<ref group=web>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering|accessdate=2009-06-16|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}</ref> The level of defilement can be coarse, medium, and subtle. It is a phenomenon that frequently arises, remains temporarily and then vanishes. Theravadins believe defilements are not only harmful to oneself, but also harmful to others. They are the driving force behind all inhumanities a human being can commit.

There are three stages of defilements. During the stage of passivity the defilements lie dormant at the base of the mental continuum as latent tendencies (''anusaya''), but through the impact of sensory stimulus, they will manifest (''pariyutthana'') themselves at the surface of consciousness in the form of unwholesome thoughts, emotions, and volitions. If they gather additional strength, the defilements will reach the dangerous stage of transgression (''vitikkama''), which will then involve physical or vocal actions.

====Ignorance====
{{Main|Avijja}}

Theravadins believe these defilements are habits born out of ignorance  that afflict the minds of all unenlightened beings, who cling to them and their influence in their ignorance of the truth. But in reality, those mental defilements are nothing more than taints that have afflicted the mind, creating suffering and stress. Unenlightened beings cling to the body, under the assumption that it represents a Self, whereas in reality the body is an impermanent phenomenon formed from the [[Mahabhuta|four basic elements]]. Often characterized by earth, water, fire and air, in the early Buddhist texts these are defined to be abstractions representing the sensorial qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility, respectively.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|[[Dan Lusthaus]] specifically discusses early Buddhism as well as Yogacara.<ref group=web>[http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm Dan Lusthaus, ''What is and isn't Yogacara'']</ref>}}

The mental defilements' frequent instigation and manipulation of the mind is believed to have prevented the mind from seeing the true nature of reality. Unskillful behavior in turn can strengthen the defilements, but following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can weaken or eradicate them. Avijja is destroyed by insight.

====Cause and Effect====
{{Main|Dependent co-arising}}

The Concept of Cause and Effect, or [[Causality]], is a key concept in Therav<U+0101>da, and indeed, in Buddhism as a whole. This concept is expressed in several ways, including the [[Four Noble Truths]], and most importantly, the Paticca-Samupp<U+0101>da ([[dependent co-arising]]).

[[Abhidhamma]] in Therav<U+0101>da canon differentiate between a root cause (Hetu) and facilitating cause (pacca). By the combined interaction of both these, an effect is brought about. On top of this view, a logic is built and elaborated whose most supple form can be seen in the [[Prat<U+012B>tyasamutp<U+0101>da|Paticca Samupp<U+0101>da]].

This concept is then used to question the nature of suffering and to elucidate the way out of it, as expressed in the [[Four Noble Truths]]. It is also employed in several [[sutras|suttas]] to refute several philosophies including [[creationism]].

By taking away a cause, the result will also disappear. From this follows the Buddhist path to end suffering and existence in [[samsara]].

===Practice===
Therav<U+0101>da orthodoxy takes the [[Visuddhimagga#Seven Stages of Purification|seven stages of purification]] as the basic outline of the path to be followed. This basic outline is based on the threefold discipline of [[S<U+012B>la]] (ethics or discipline), [[Sam<U+0101>dhi]] (meditative concentration), [[Pa<U+00F1><U+00F1>a]] (understanding or wisdom). The emphasis is on understanding the three marks of existence, which removes [[vijnana]], ignorance. Understanding destroys the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|Ten Fetters]] and leads to [[Nirvana]].

Theravadins believe that every individual is personally responsible for their own self-awakening and liberation, as they are the ones that were responsible for their own actions and consequences (Sanskrit: ''[[Karma (Buddhism)|karma]]''; Pali: ''kamma''). Simply learning or believing in the true nature of reality as expounded by the Buddha is not enough, the awakening can only be achieved through direct experience and personal realization. Yet there is a widespread belief in Therav<U+0101>da that we're living in a degenerated epoch, in which true liberation is no longer possible.

====Noble Eightfold Path and Threefold Discipline====
{{Main|Noble Eightfold Path}}

In the Sutta Pitaka the path to liberation is described by the Noble Eightfold Path:
{{quote|The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, is the Noble Eightfold Path? Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.<ref group=web>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html Magga-vibhanga Sutta: An Analysis of the Path]</ref>}}

The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can also be summarized as the Three Noble Disciplines.<ref group=web>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.pali.103879 |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:989.pali |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> These are known as discipline (''[[s<U+012B>la]]''), wisdom (''[[pa<U+00F1><U+00F1><U+0101>]]''), and training of mind (''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|sam<U+0101>dhi]]'').<ref group=web>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

====Seven purifications====
[[Image:Buddhaghosa offering his commentaries.jpg|thumb|[[Buddhaghosa|Venerable Buddhaghosa]] offering [[Visuddhimagga]] to the monks of [[Mahavihara]]. Painting from [[Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara]], a Buddhist temple in [[Kelaniya]] near [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]].]]

The [[Visuddhimagga]], written in the fifth century CE by [[Buddhaghosa]], has become the orthodox account of the Therav<U+0101>da path to liberation. It gives a sequence of seven purifications, based on the sequence of sila, samadhi and prajna.

It is composed of three sections, which discuss: 1) ''[[S<U+012B>la]]'' (ethics or discipline); 2) ''[[Sam<U+0101>dhi]]'' (meditative concentration); 3) ''[[Pa<U+00F1><U+00F1>a]]'' (understanding or wisdom).
* The first section (part 1) explains the rules of discipline, and the method for finding a correct temple to practice, or how to meet a [[Kalyana mittata|good teacher]].
* The second section (part 2) describes [[samatha]]'s practice, object by object (see [[Kammatthana]] for the list of the forty traditional objects). It mentions different stages of concentration.
* The third section (part 3-7) is a description of the five [[skandha]]s (aggregates), [[ayatana]]s, the [[Four Noble Truths]], dependent origination ([[Pratitya-samutpada]]), and the practice of [[vipassana]] through the development of wisdom. It emphasizes [[Vipassan<U+0101>-<U+00F1><U+0101><U+1E47>a|different forms of knowledge]] emerging because of the practice. This part shows a great analytical effort specific to Buddhist philosophy.

The seven purifications are:{{sfn|Gunaratana|1994|p=143-174}}
# Purification of Conduct (''s<U+012B>la-visuddhi'')
# Purification of Mind (''citta-visuddhi'')
# Purification of View (''ditthi-visuddhi'')
# Purification by Overcoming Doubt (''kankha-vitarana-visuddhi'')
# Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What Is Path and Not Path (''maggamagga-<U+00F1>anadassana-visuddhi'')
# Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the Course of Practice (''patipada-<U+00F1>anadassana-visuddhi'')
## Knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall (''udayabbayanupassana-nana'')
## Knowledge of contemplation of dissolution (''bhanganupassana-nana'')
## Knowledge of appearance as terror (''bhayatupatthana-nana'')
## Knowledge of contemplation of danger (''adinavanupassana-nana'')
## Knowledge of contemplation of dispassion (''nibbidanupassana-nana'')
## Knowledge of desire for deliverance (''muncitukamyata-nana'')
## Knowledge of contemplation of reflection (''patisankhanupassana-nana'')
## Knowledge of equanimity about formations (''sankharupekka-nana'')
## Conformity knowledge (''anuloma-nana'')
# Purification by Knowledge and Vision (''<U+00F1>anadassana-visuddhi'')
## Change of lineage
## [[Sot<U+0101>panna|The first path and fruit]]
## [[Sakadagami|The second path and fruit]]
## [[An<U+0101>g<U+0101>mi|The third path and fruit]]
## [[Arhat (Buddhism)|The fourth path and fruit]]

The "Purification by Knowledge and Vision" is the culmination of the practice, in [[Four stages of enlightenment|four stages]] leading to liberation and Nirvana.

The emphasis in this system is on understanding the three marks of existence, [[dukkha]], [[anatta]], [[anicca]]. This emphasis is recognizable in the value that is given to [[vipassana]] over [[samatha]], especially in the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]].

====Meditation====
[[Image:Phra Ajan Jerapunyo-Abbot of Watkungtaphao..jpg|thumb|Thai novice in [[meditation]]]]

{{Main|Buddhist meditation}}

Therav<U+0101>da  Buddhist meditation practices fall into two broad categories: ''[[samatha]]'', and  ''[[Vipassana|vipassan<U+0101>]]''.<ref group=web>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3558.pali |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This distinction is not made in the sutras, but in the [[Visuddhimagga]].<ref group=web name=supramundane /> Some common terms encountered in the Therav<U+0101>da practice of meditation are:
* [[Anapanasati]]
* [[Metta]]
* [[Kamma<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>h<U+0101>na]]
* [[Samatha]]
* [[Vipassana]]

Meditation (Pali: ''Bhavana'') means the positive reinforcement of one's mind. Broadly categorized into Samatha and Vipassana, Meditation is the key tool implemented in attaining [[Jhana in Therav<U+0101>da|jhana]]. Samatha literally means "to make skillful," and has other renderings also, among which are "tranquilizing, calming," "visualizing," and "achieving." Vipassana means "insight" or "abstract understanding." In this context, Samatha Meditation makes a person skillful in concentration of mind. Once the mind is sufficiently concentrated, Vipassana allows one to see through the veil of ignorance.

In order to be free from suffering and stress, Theravadins believe that the defilements need to be permanently uprooted. Initially the defilements are restrained through [[Vipassana|mindfulness]] to prevent them from taking over mental and bodily action. They are then uprooted through internal investigation, analysis, experience and understanding of their true nature by using  [[Jhana in Therav<U+0101>da|jhana]]. This process needs to be repeated for each and every defilement. The practice will then lead the meditator to realize [[Nirvana]].

=====Samatha meditation=====
[[Image:AjahnChahSangha.jpg|thumb|[[Thai Forest Tradition]] meditation master, the [[Ajahn Chah|Venerable Ajahn Chah]] with his resident [[Sangha]] at [[Wat Nong Pah Pong| Wat Nong Pah Pong monastery]] in [[Ubon Ratchathani]], Thailand ]]

{{Main|Samatha}}

The [[samatha]] meditation in Therav<U+0101>da is usually involved with the concepts of [[Kamma<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>h<U+0101>na]] which literally stands for "place of work"; in this context, it is the "place" or object of concentration (P<U+0101>li: ''<U+0100>rammana'') where the mind is at work. In samatha meditation, the mind is set at work concentrated on one particular entity. There are forty (40) such classic objects (entities) used in samatha meditation, which are termed [[Kamma<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>h<U+0101>na]]. By acquiring a [[Kamma<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>h<U+0101>na]] and practising samatha meditation, one would be able to attain certain elevated states of awareness and skill of the mind called [[Jhana in Therav<U+0101>da|Jhana]]. Practising samatha has [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]] (concentration) as its ultimate goal.

It should be noted that samatha is not a method that is unique to Buddhism. In the ''sutta''s it is said to be implemented in other contemporary religions in India at the time of Buddha. In fact, the first teachers of Siddhartha, before they attained the state of awakening (P<U+0101>li: ''Bodhi''), are said to have been quite skillful in samatha (although the term had not been coined yet). In the [[Pali Canon]] discourses, the Buddha frequently instructs his disciples to practice [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]] (concentration) in order to establish and develop [[Jhana in Therav<U+0101>da|jhana]] (full concentration).  [[Jhana in Therav<U+0101>da|Jhana]] is the instrument used by the Buddha himself to penetrate the true nature of phenomena (through investigation and direct experience) and to reach Enlightenment.<ref group=web>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/buddha.html|title=A Sketch of the Buddha's Life |accessdate=2009-03-26|publisher=Access to Insight }}</ref> Right Concentration (''samma-samadhi'') is one of the elements in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]] can be developed from mindfulness developed with [[kamma<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>h<U+0101>na]] such as concentration on breathing (''[[anapanasati]]''), from visual objects (''[[kasina]]''), and repetition of phrases. The traditional list contains 40 objects of meditation (''{{IAST|[[kamma<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>h<U+0101>na]]}}'') to be used for Samatha Meditation. Every object has a specific goal; for example, meditation on the parts of the body (''kayanupassana'' or ''kayagathasathi'') will result in a lessening of attachment to our own bodies and those of others, resulting in a reduction of sensual desires. [[Mett<U+0101>]] (loving kindness) generates the feelings of goodwill and happiness toward ourselves and other beings; metta practice serves as an antidote to ill-will, wrath and fear.

=====Vipassan<U+0101> meditation=====
{{Main|Vipassana}}

[[Vipassan<U+0101>]] is the ability to see everything as is. "Vi" in pali means great or beyond, while "passan<U+0101>" means to see. [[Vipassan<U+0101>]] then is concerned with seeing through the veil of ignorance (P<U+0101>li: ''Avijj<U+0101>'') and so, is unique to Buddhism. It can be aided by a practised mind (with samatha) but samatha is not necessary to practice vipassan<U+0101>. Chiefly, vipassan<U+0101> is involved in breaking the ten [[Fetters (Buddhism)|Fetters]] that bind one to the ever-iterating cycle of birth and death i.e. [[samsara]]. Some teachers do not distinguish between the two methods, rather prescribing meditation methods that develop both concentration and insight.

===Attainment===

====Path and fruit====
Practice leads to mundane and supramundane wisdom, leading to Nirvana:
{{quote|The term "supramundane" [''lokuttara''] applies exclusively to that which transcends the world, that is the nine supramundane states: Nibbana, the four noble paths (magga) leading to Nibbana, and their corresponding fruits (phala) which experience the bliss of Nibbana.<ref group=web name=supramundane />}}

Mundane wisdom is the insight in the [[three marks of existence]].<ref group=web name=supramundane /> The development of this insight leads to four supramundane paths and fruits:
{{quote|Each path is a momentary peak experience directly apprehending Nibbana and permanently cutting off certain defilements.<ref group=web name=supramundane />}}

Each path is followed by its supramundane fruit:
{{quote|whereas the path performs the active function of cutting off defilements, fruition simply enjoys the bliss and peace that result when the path has completed its task. Also, where the path is limited to a single moment of consciousness, the fruition that follows immediately on the path endures for two or three moments. And while each of the four paths occurs only once and can never be repeated, fruition remains accessible to the noble disciple.<ref group=web name=supramundane />}}

====Nirvana====

{{Main|Nirvana}}

Nirvana ({{lang-sa|<U+0928><U+093F><U+0930><U+094D><U+0935><U+093E><U+0923>|}}, ''{{IAST|Nirv<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}''; {{lang-pi|<U+0928><U+093F><U+092C><U+094D><U+092C><U+093E><U+0928>}}, ''{{IAST|Nibb<U+0101>na}}''; {{lang-th|<U+0E19><U+0E34><U+0E1E><U+0E1E><U+0E32><U+0E19>|}}, ''{{IAST|N<U+00ED>pphaan}}'') is the ultimate goal of Theravadins. It is a state where the fire of the passions has been 'blown out', and the person is liberated from the repeated cycle of birth, illness, aging and death. In the Sa<U+1E43>yojanapuggala Sutta of the A<U+1E45>gutarra Nikaya, the Buddha describes four kinds of persons and tells us that the last person - the Arahant - has attained Nibbana by removing all 10 [[fetters]] that bind beings to samsara:
<blockquote>"In the Arahant.  In this person, monks, all of the fetters ['sa<U+1E43>yojan<U+0101>ni'] are gotten rid of that pertain to this world, give rise to rebirth, and give rise to becoming."<ref name="PTS: A ii 133-134">{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=F.L.|title=The Book of Gradual Sayings (A<U+1E47>guttara Nik<U+0101>ya)|year=2008|publisher=Pali Text Society - Oxford|isbn= 0860130150|page=137}}</ref></blockquote>

According to the early scriptures, the Nirvana attained by ''[[Arahant]]s'' is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as there is only one type of Nirvana.<ref group=web>{{cite web |url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html |title = A Treatise on the Paramis: From the Commentary to the Cariyapitaka |accessdate = 2007-07-31 |last = Bodhi }}</ref> Theravadins believe the Buddha was superior to ''Arahants'' because the Buddha discovered the path all by himself and taught it to others (i,e., metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). ''Arahants'', on the other hand, attained Nirvana due in part to the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the Buddha as a supremely gifted person but also recognize the existence of other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. [[Maitreya]] (Pali: Metteyya), for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who will come in the distant future.

==Scriptures==

===Pali Canon===
{{Main|Pali Canon}}
[[Image:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|thumb|upright|One of the 729 large marble tablets of the Pali Canon (the [[World's largest book]])  inscribed using the [[Burmese alphabet]] at the [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] in [[Mandalay]], Burma. ]]

The Therav<U+0101>da school upholds the [[Pali Canon]] or [[Tipitaka]] as the most authoritative collection of texts on the teachings of Gautama Buddha.  The [[S<U+016B>tra|Sutta]] and [[Vinaya]] portion of the Tipitaka shows considerable overlap in content to the [[<U+0100>gama (Buddhism)|Agamas]], the parallel collections used by non-Therav<U+0101>da schools in India which are preserved in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and partially in [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], and [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], and the various non-Therav<U+0101>da Vinayas. On this basis, both these sets of texts are generally believed to be the oldest and most authoritative texts on Buddhism by scholars. It is also believed that much of the Pali Canon, which is still used by Therav<U+0101>da communities, was transmitted to Sri Lanka during the reign of Asoka. After being orally transmitted (as was the custom in those days for religious texts) for some centuries, were finally committed to writing in the last century BC, at what the Therav<U+0101>da usually reckons as the fourth council, in [[Sri Lanka]]. Therav<U+0101>da is one of the first Buddhist schools to commit the whole complete set of its Buddhist canon into writing.<ref>Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 3.</ref>

Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically "Therav<U+0101>dan," but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey: <blockquote>The Therav<U+0101>dans, then, may have ''added'' texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.<ref>Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press, 1995, page 9.</ref></blockquote>

The Pali Tipitaka consists of three parts: the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], [[Sutta Pitaka]] and [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]. Of these, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is believed to be a later addition to the first two pitakas, which, in the opinion of many scholars, were the only two pitakas at the time of the [[First Buddhist Council]].  The Pali Abhidhamma was not recognized outside the Therav<U+0101>da school.

The Tipitaka is composed of 45 volumes in the Thai edition, 40 in the Burmese and 58 in the Sinhalese, and a full set of the Tipitaka is usually kept in its own (medium-sized) cupboard.

===Commentaries===
In the 4th or 5th century [[Buddhaghosa]] Thera wrote the first [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] to much of the Tipitaka (which were based on much older manuscripts, mostly in old Sinhalese). After him many other monks wrote various commentaries, which have become part of the Therav<U+0101>da heritage. These texts do not have the same authority as the Tipitaka does, though Buddhaghosas [[Visuddhimagga]] is a cornerstone of the commentarial tradition.

The commentaries, together with the Abhidhamma, define the specific Therav<U+0101>da heritage. Related versions of the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka were common to all the [[Early Buddhist Schools|early Buddhist schools]], and therefore do not define only Therav<U+0101>da, but also the other early Buddhist schools, and perhaps the teaching of [[Gautama Buddha]] himself.

Therav<U+0101>da Buddhists consider much of what is found in the Chinese and Tibetan Mahayana scriptural collections to be apocryphal, meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha.<ref>Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004 (Volume Two), page 756</ref>

==Lay and monastic life==
[[Image:Young monk.jpg|thumb|upright|Young Burmese monk]]

{{See also|Buddhist monasticism}}

===Distinction between lay and monastic life===
Traditionally, Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a [[Householder (Buddhism)|lay person]] and the practices undertaken by ordained [[Bhikkhu|monks]] (in ancient times, there was a separate body of practices for nuns).  While the possibility of significant attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the Therav<U+0101>da, it generally occupies a position of less prominence than in the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving [[Nirvana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasocietymuseum.org/buddhist_trade/glossary.html#Therav<U+0101>da|title=Glossary of Buddhism|work=Buddhist Art and the Trade Routes|publisher=[[Asia Society]]|year=2003|accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> The view that Therav<U+0101>da, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a monastic tradition has, however, been disputed.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ron Epstein: "Some Western scholars have erroneously tried to claim that Mahayana is primarily a religion for laymen and Therav<U+0101>da is a priamarily monastic religion. Both Mahayana and Therav<U+0101>da have as their foundation strong monastic communities, which are almost identical in their regulations. Schools of Mahayana Buddhism without monastic communities of fully ordained monks and nuns are relatively recent and atypical developments, usually based on cultural and historical considerations rather than differences in fundamental doctrine. Both Mahayana and Therav<U+0101>da also provided a clear and important place for lay followers."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Epstein |first1=Ron |year=1999<U+2013>02 |title=Clearing Up Some Misconceptions about Buddhism |journal= Vajra Bodhi Sea: A Monthly Journal of Orthodox Buddhism |publisher=Dharma Realm Buddhist Association |pages= 41<U+2013>43 |url=http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Misconceptions%20about%20Buddhism.htm}}</ref>}}

This distinction between ordained monks and laypeople&nbsp;<U+2014> as well as the distinction between those practices advocated by the Pali Canon, and the folk religious elements embraced by many monks&nbsp;<U+2014> have motivated some scholars to consider Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism to be composed of multiple separate traditions, overlapping though still distinct.  Most prominently, the anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] in his work ''Buddhism and Society'' separated Burmese Therav<U+0101>da into three groups: ''Apotropaic Buddhism'' (concerned with providing protection from evil spirits), ''Kammatic Buddhism'' (concerned with [[making merit]] for a future birth), and ''Nibbanic Buddhism'' (concerned with attaining the liberation of [[Nirvana]], as described in the Tipitaka). He stresses that all three are firmly rooted in the Pali Canon. These categories are not accepted by all scholars, and are usually considered non-exclusive by those who employ them.

The role of lay people has traditionally been primarily occupied with activities that are commonly termed ''[[Merit (Buddhism)|merit making]]'' (falling under Spiro's category of kammatic Buddhism).  Merit making activities include offering food and other basic necessities to monks, making donations to temples and monasteries, burning incense or lighting candles before images of the Buddha, and chanting protective or merit-making verses from the Pali Canon. Some lay practitioners have always chosen to take a more active role in religious affairs, while still maintaining their lay status. Dedicated lay men and women sometimes act as trustees or custodians for their temples, taking part in the financial planning and management of the temple. Others may volunteer significant time in tending to the mundane needs of local monks (by cooking, cleaning, maintaining temple facilities, etc.). Lay activities have traditionally not extended to study of the Pali scriptures, nor the practice of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], though in the 20th Century these areas have become more accessible to the lay community, especially in Thailand.

[[Image:Monk on pilgrimage.jpg|thumb|Thai monks on [[pilgrimage]] in their orange robes.]]
A number of senior monastics in the Thai Forest Tradition, including [[Buddhadasa|Ajahn Buddhadasa]], [[Luang Ta Maha Bua]], Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Pasanno, and Ajahn Jayasaro, have begun teaching meditation retreats outside of the monastery for lay disciples.

[[Ajahn Chah]], a disciple of [[Ajahn Mun]], set up a monastic lineage called [[Cittaviveka]] with his disciple [[Ajahn Sumedho]], at Chithurst in West Sussex, England. Ajahn Sumedho later founded the [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] in Hertfordshire, which has a retreat center specifically for lay retreats. Sumedho extended this to Harnham in Northumberland as ''[[Aruna Ratanagiri]]'' under the present guidance of [[Ajahn Munindo]], another disciple of Ajahn Chah.

===Scholar monks and rural monks===
[[Nirvana]], the highest goal of Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism, is attained through study and the practice of morality, meditation and wisdom ([[<U+015A><U+012B>la|sila]], [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], [[Praj<U+00F1><U+0101>|panna]]). The goal of Nirvana (and its associated techniques) have traditionally been seen as the domain of the fully ordained monastic, whereas many of the same techniques can be used by laypeople to generate happiness in their lives, without focusing on Nirvana. Monastic roles in the Therav<U+0101>da can be broadly described as being split between the role of the (often urban) scholar monk and the (often rural or forest) meditation monk. Both types of monks serve their communities as spiritual teachers and officiants by presiding over spiritual ceremonies and providing instruction in basic Buddhist morality and teachings.

Scholar monks undertake the path of studying and preserving the Pali literature of the Therav<U+0101>da. They may devote little time to the practice of meditation, but may attain great respect and renown by becoming masters of a particular section of the Pali Canon or its commentaries. Masters of the [[Abhidhamma]], called Abhidhammika, are particularly respected in the scholastic tradition.

Meditation monks, often called forest monks because of their association with certain wilderness-dwelling traditions, are considered to be specialists in meditation. While some forest monks may undertake significant study of the Pali Canon, in general meditation monks are expected to learn primarily from their meditation experiences and personal teachers, and may not know more of the Tipitaka than is necessary to participate in liturgical life and to provide a foundation for fundamental Buddhist teachings. More so than the scholastic tradition, the meditation tradition is associated with the attainment of certain supernatural powers described in both Pali sources and folk tradition. These powers include the attainment of [[Nirvana]], mind-reading, supernatural power over material objects and their own material bodies, seeing and conversing with gods and beings living in hell, and remembering their past lives. These powers are called [[abhi<U+00F1><U+00F1>a]]. Sometimes the remain of the cremated bone fragment of an accomplished forest monk is believed able to transform itself into crystal-like relics ([[s<U+0101>rira-dh<U+0101>tu]]).

===Ordination===
[[Image:Candidate for the Buddhist priesthood is ordaining to is a monk in a church.jpg|thumb|upright|Candidate for the Buddhist monkhood is ordained as a monk in Thailand]]

The minimum age for ordaining as a Buddhist monk is 20 years, reckoned from conception. However, boys under that age are allowed to ordain as novices (samanera), performing a ceremony such as ''[[Shinbyu]]'' in Burma. Novices shave their heads, wear the yellow robes, and observe [[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|ten basic precepts]]. Although no specific minimum age for novices is mentioned in the scriptures, traditionally boys as young as seven are accepted. This tradition follows the story of the Lord Buddha<U+2019>s son, Rahula, who was allowed to become a novice at the age of seven. Monks follow 227 rules of discipline, while nuns follow 311 rules.

In most Therav<U+0101>da countries, it is a common practice for young men to ordain as monks for a fixed period of time.  In Thailand and Burma, young men typically ordain for the 3 month Rain Retreat ([[vassa]]), though shorter or longer periods of ordination are not rare.  Traditionally, temporary ordination was even more flexible among Laotians. Once they had undergone their initial ordination as young men, Laotian men were permitted to temporarily ordain again at any time, though married men were expected to seek their wife's permission.  Throughout Southeast Asia, there is little stigma attached to leaving the monastic life.  Monks regularly leave the robes after acquiring an education, or when compelled by family obligations or ill health.

Ordaining as a monk, even for a short period, is seen as having many virtues.  In many Southeast Asian cultures, it is seen as a means for a young man to "repay" his parents for their work and effort in raising him, because the merit from his ordination accrues to them as well.  Thai men who have ordained as a monk may be seen as more fit husbands by Thai women, who refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning "ripe" to indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage.  Particularly in rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally gave peasant boys an opportunity to gain an education in temple schools without committing to a permanent monastic life.

In Sri Lanka, temporary ordination is not practiced, and a monk leaving the order is frowned upon.  The continuing influence of the [[caste system]] in Sri Lanka may play a role in the taboo against temporary ordination and leaving the monkhood.  Though Sri Lankan monastic nikayas are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during their time as monks may act (or be treated) in a way that would not be in line with the expected duties and privileges of their caste.

Men and women born in western countries, who become Buddhists as adults, wish to become monks or nuns. It is possible, and one can live as a monk or nun in the country they were born in, seek monks or nuns which has gathered in a different western country or move to a monastery in countries like Sri Lanka or Thailand.
It is seen as being easier to live a life as a monk or nun in countries where people generally live by the culture of Buddhism, since it is difficult to live by the rules of a monk or a nun in a western country. For instance; a Therav<U+0101>da monk or nun is not allowed to work, handle money, listen to music, cook and so on, which are extremely difficult rules to live by in cultures which do not embrace Buddhism.
The recommendation is usually that to be able to live fully as a monk or nun you should move to a monastery in a country with a culture that embraces Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism.

Some of the more well-known Therav<U+0101>dan monks are: [[Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta]], [[Ajahn Chah]], [[Ledi Sayadaw]], Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, [[Ajahn Sumedho]], [[Ajahn Khemadhammo]], [[Ajahn Brahm]],  [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Buddhadasa]], [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], [[Nyanaponika Thera]], [[Preah Maha Ghosananda]], [[Sayadaw U Pandita]], [[Ajahn Amaro]], [[Ajahn Sucitto]], [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], [[Walpola Rahula]], [[Bhante Henepola Gunaratana]], and Bhante Yogavacara Rahula.

===Monastic practices===
[[Image:EveningPrayers01a.jpg|thumb|upright|A Buddhist Monk chants evening prayers inside a monastery located near the town of [[Kantharalak]], [[Thailand]].]]

The practices usually vary in different sub-schools and monasteries within Therav<U+0101>da. But in the most orthodox forest monastery, the monk usually models his practice and lifestyle on that of the Buddha and his first generation of disciples by living close to nature in forest, mountains and caves. Forest monasteries still keep alive the ancient traditions through following the Buddhist monastic code of discipline in all its detail and developing meditation in secluded forests.

In a typical daily routine at the monastery during the 3 month vassa period, the monk will wake up before dawn and will begin the day with group chanting and meditation. At dawn the monks will go out to surrounding villages bare-footed on alms-round and will have the only meal of the day before noon by eating from the bowl by hand. Most of the time is spent on Dhamma study and meditation. Sometimes the abbot or a senior monk will give a Dhamma talk to the visitors. Laity who stay at the monastery will have to abide by the traditional [[Eight precepts|eight Buddhist precepts]].

The life of the monk or nun in a community is much more complex than the life of the forest monk. In the Buddhist society of Sri Lanka, most monks spend hours every day in taking care of the needs of lay people such as preaching ''bana,''<ref>PUBLICATIONSMahinda Deegalle, Popularizing Buddhism: Preaching as Performance in Sri Lanka, State University of New York Press, Albany, NY,  2006.</ref> accepting alms, officiating funerals, teaching ''dhamma'' to adults and children in addition to providing social services to the community.

After the end of the Vassa period, many of the monks will go out far away from the monastery to find a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their umbrella tents and where it is suitable for the work of self-development. When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along.  These generally consist of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and a candle lantern.

The monks do not fix their times for walking and sitting meditation, for as soon as they are free they just start doing it; nor do they determine for how long they will go on to meditate. Some of them sometimes walk from dusk to dawn whereas at other times they may walk from between two to seven hours. Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation.

Those monks who have been able to achieve a high level of attainment will be able to guide the junior monks and lay Buddhists toward the four degrees of spiritual attainment.

===Lay devotee===

[[Image:Vesak in Uttaradit (Thailand) 1.jpg|thumb|left|The ceremony walks with lighted candles in hand around a temple on [[Vesak|Vesakha Puja]] in [[Uttaradit]], Thailand.]]

In Pali the word for a male lay devotee is [[Upasaka]]. Upasika is its female equivalent. One of the duties of the lay followers, as taught by the Buddha, is to look after the needs of the monk/nuns. They are to see that the monk/nuns do not suffer from lack of the four requisites: food, clothing, shelter and medicine. As neither monks nor nuns are allowed to have an occupation, they depend entirely on the laity for their sustenance. In return for this charity, they are expected to lead exemplary lives.

In Burma and Thailand, the monastery was and is still regarded as a seat of learning. In fact today about half of the primary schools in Thailand are located in monasteries.  Religious rituals and ceremonies held in a monastery are always accompanied by social activities. In times of crisis, it is to the monks that people bring their problems for counsel.

Traditionally, a ranking monk will deliver a sermon four times a month: when the moon waxes and wanes and the day before the new and full moons. The laity also have a chance to learn meditation from the monks during these times.

It is also possible for a lay disciple to become enlightened.  As Bhikkhu Bodhi notes, "The Suttas and commentaries do record a few cases of lay disciples attaining the final goal of Nirvana. However, such disciples either attain Arahantship on the brink of death or enter the monastic order soon after their attainment. They do not continue to dwell at home as Arahant householders, for dwelling at home is incompatible with the state of one who has severed all craving."<ref>Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words'', Wisdom Publications 2005;  page 376</ref>

===Monastic orders within Therav<U+0101>da===
[[Image:Thai Buddhist monk blesses.jpg|thumb|Thai monks blessing the [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King of Thailand]] in Wat Nong Wong, [[Sawankhalok District|Amphoe Sawankhalok]], [[Sukhothai Province|Sukhothai]], Thailand.]]

Therav<U+0101>da monks typically belong to a particular ''[[nikaya]]'', variously referred to as monastic orders or fraternities.  These different orders do not typically develop separate doctrines, but may differ in the manner in which they observe monastic rules. These monastic orders represent lineages of ordination, typically tracing their origin to a particular group of monks that established a new ordination tradition within a particular country or geographic area.

In Sri Lanka caste plays a major role in the division into nikayas. Some Therav<U+0101>da Buddhist countries appoint or elect a [[sangharaja]], or Supreme Patriarch of the Sangha, as the highest ranking or seniormost monk in a particular area, or from a particular nikaya.  The demise of monarchies has resulted in the suspension of these posts in some countries, but patriarchs have continued to be appointed in Thailand.  Burma and Cambodia ended the practice of appointing a sangharaja for some time, but the position was later restored, though in Cambodia it lapsed again.
