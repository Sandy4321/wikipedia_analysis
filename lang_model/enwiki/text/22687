'''German submarine ''U-889''''' was a [[German Type IX submarine|Type IXC/40]] [[U-boat]] of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]].

''U-889'' was laid down on 13 September 1943 at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] and was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 August 1944, with [[Captain Lieutenant#Germany|'Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'']] ([[Lieutenant]]) Friedrich Braeucker as commander. Until 14 March 1945 she was attached to [[4th U-boat Flotilla]] for training. She was then assigned to [[33rd U-boat Flotilla]], a combat unit based at [[Flensburg]]. Her first, and only, active patrol started on 15 March 1945.
==Armament==
===FLAK weaponry===
''U-889'' was mounted with the rare Twin [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43|3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U]] on the LM42U mount. This was one of the best [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] weapons used by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. It was mainly used on the [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]] as it was rather heavy for the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]] U-boats.

==Surrender==
After the [[Victory in Europe Day|German surrender]] on 8 May 1945, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] ordered all [[U-boat]]s to surrender. On the afternoon of 10 May, ''U-889'' was spotted south of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] by a [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] airplane, steaming at 10 knots and flying a [[List of black flags|black flag]] of surrender. The RCAF plane radioed to nearby [[Western Escort Force W-6]] who intercepted the [[submarine]] an hour later. ''U-889'' was ordered to head to [[Bay Bulls, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bay Bulls, Newfoundland]]. 24 hours later ''U-889'' was turned over to the [[River class frigate|frigate]]s {{HMCS|Buckingham|K685|6}} and {{HMCS|Inch Arran|K667|6}} who escorted her to [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne Harbour]] where she was boarded and Braeucker, her Commanding Officer, made a formal surrender.


On May 14, 1945 U-889 was commissioned into the RCN and decommissioned in December 1945.

''U-889'' was one of ten U-boats allocated to the [[United States]] as part of the Tripartite Naval Commission sitting in [[Berlin]] in November 1945. She sailed to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] on 11 January 1946 and experiments were conducted on her special [[hydrophone]] gear. She was [[scuttling|scuttled]] at the end of 1947.
