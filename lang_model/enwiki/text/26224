'''Hengistbury Head''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|h|<U+025B>|<U+014B>|<U+0261>|<U+0259>|s|t|b|r|i}} is a [[headlands and bays|headland]] jutting into the [[English Channel]] between [[Bournemouth]] and [[Milford on Sea]] in the English county of [[Dorset]]. It is a site of international importance in terms of its archaeology and is scheduled as an [[Ancient Monument]].<ref name=archeologyhhsg>{{cite web|title=Archaeology|url=http://www.hengistburyhead.org/nature/archaeology.html|publisher=Hengistbury Head Supporters Group|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> Declared a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in 1990, the head and its surroundings form part of the [[Christchurch Harbour]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref name=HHSG>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Nature Reserve|url=http://www.hengistburyhead.org/|publisher=Hengistbury Head Supporters Group|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref> It is also a [[Special Area of Conservation]], [[Special Protection Area]], an [[Environmentally Sensitive Area]] and a [[Site of Nature Conservation Interest]].<ref name=hhcouncil>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Local Nature Reserve|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/LeisureCultureLibraries/Parks/Bournemouths-Countryside/LocalNatureReserves/HengistburyHeadLocalNatureReserve.aspx|publisher=[[Bournemouth Borough Council]]|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> The name "Hengistbury Head" refers to the immediate area; the elevated portion is called [[Warren Hill, Dorset|Warren Hill]].

There has been human activity on the site since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]; during the [[Victorian era]] it was heavily quarried, and in recent years tourism has become significant<U+2014>it receives over a million visitors annually. The various habitats on the Head provide a home for many plants, birds and insects, some of them rare and critically endangered. [[Erosion]] remains a threat to the site, although long-term projects are intended to secure it for the future.

The isolated building near the centre of the image (labelled "Summer House") is the thatched barn still at the Head. The barn forms part of the new visitor centre.]]
Hengistbury Head is a [[sandstone]] headland forming part of [[Southbourne, Dorset|Southbourne]], which is a suburb of the town of [[Bournemouth]] to the west; the nearest major settlement is [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to the north. It is the most easterly part of the Borough of [[Bournemouth]], and marks the most easterly point of [[Poole Bay]]. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Hampshire]], the [[Local Government Act 1972]] designated the area a part of Dorset. The northern slope of the hill tailing off towards the sea forms [[Mudeford]] [[Spit (landform)|spit]], the sand bar closing [[Christchurch Harbour]] from the south.

==Buildings==
The spit is home to more 300 privately owned [[Beach hut|beach-huts]], one of which in 2012 became one of the UK's most expensive, selling for <U+00A3>170,000 just two days after being put on the market.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beach hut property near Bournemouth sells for <U+00A3>170,000 |first=Hilary|last=Osborne|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/jun/18/beach-hut-property-sale |newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> The hut measures a little over five by three metres, has no running water, and the occupants may only stay overnight from March to October. Despite the relative lack of amenities, the area has become one of the UK's most desirable; huts are rented out for up to <U+00A3>600 a week.<ref name=MSBHA>{{cite web |title=Huts for rent |url=http://www.msbha.org.uk/huts_for_rent.html |publisher=Mudeford Sandbank Beach Hut Association |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>

The Black House, a local landmark, stands at the end of the spit, opposite [[Mudeford Quay]], site of the [[Battle of Mudeford]] in 1784.  Built in 1848, it was once a boat-builders' house, but is now rented out to holidaymakers.<ref name=ManagementPlan>{{cite journal |title=Mudeford Sandbank Management Plan |publisher=Christchurch Borough Council |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/media.jsp?mediaid=74488&filetype=pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,0,792 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-03-23}}</ref> It has served a variety of functions over the years, and is commonly associated with the area's smuggling past.<ref name="Black House">{{cite web |title=History of the Black House |url=http://www.theblackhouse.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=36 |publisher=The Black House |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Mentioned as Hednesburia in a church [[deed]] of the early 12th century, and referred to as Hynesbury Head in the 17th, Hengistbury only took on its current spelling in the 19th century, during a period of what archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]] calls "antiquarian romanticism".<ref name= "Cunliffe.p15">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=15}}</ref> Many prehistoric sites around this time were renamed to link them with historical figures.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p15" />  It was thought at the time that the legendary [[Anglo-Saxon]] leader [[Hengist]] could be buried here, as he was said to have been laid to rest in an unlocated mound. Twentieth-century excavations have established that the [[tumuli]] at Hengistbury Head date to the [[Bronze Age]] however.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p23">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=23}}</ref>

==History==
Hengistbury Head is home to a plethora of nationally and internationally significant archaeological sites, with features dating from the Late Upper Palaeolithic to the [[Roman Britain|Roman settlement of Britain]], earning the site [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] status.<ref name="Southampton 2011">{{cite web|title=New CAHO fieldwork at Hengistbury Head started|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/archaeology/caho/news/hengistbury.shtml|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=8 August 2011}}</ref> Interest in the site declined throughout the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], until extensive development took place in Christchurch around 890 AD, when the Head may have been used as a lookout post. The area was heavily quarried during the [[Victorian period]] and nowadays receives over a million visitors annually.<ref name="Visitor Centre">{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Visitor Centre|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/LeisureCultureLibraries/Parks/ProjectsandConsultations/Projects/HengistburyHeadVisitorCentre.aspx|publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>

===Stone Age===
Several archaeological digs have revealed that the site was occupied during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]].<ref name= "Cunliffe.p18-20">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=18-20}}</ref>
There is evidence of an open settlement of the [[Creswellian]] culture on the hill in the middle of the headland dating to around 10,500 BC. After the ploughing of [[Warren Hill, Christchurch, Dorset|Warren Hill]] in 1913, thousands of flint implements covering the entire [[Stone Age]] were discovered.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p18">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=18}}</ref>
Most interesting were several blades typically found at Upper Paleolithic sites across Europe, but rarely seen outside of caves in the UK, where open air sites of this age are extremely rare.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p20">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=20}}</ref>
People at the Head were heavily involved with the production of blades, further excavations identified 649 tools, dominated by [[Microlith#Backed_edge_blades|backed blades]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|endscrapers]] and [[burins]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pettitt |first1=Paul |last2=White |first2=Mark |year=2012 |isbn=1-136-49677-7 |title=The British Palaeolithic: Human Societies at the Edge of the Pleistocene World |page=472}}</ref>
At the time the Warren Hill would have overlooked a large river valley that was to become the [[English Channel]]. Once the sea had inundated the surrounding valley, [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter gatherers]] exploited the site. [[Pollen analysis]] of [[peat]] from the [[Solent]] bed suggest a lightly wooded headland free of close-knit [[undergrowth]] during this period, an ideal habitat for [[game (food)|game]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SqV8wB5H5pMC&pg=PA35&dq=hengistbury+head+stone+age#v=onepage&q=hengistbury%20head%20stone%20age&f=false |page=36|title=The Archers of Hengistbury Head |journal=[[New Scientist]]|first=Peter|last=James| date=3 May 1984}}</ref>

===Bronze Age===
Eleven [[Bronze Age]] [[round barrow]]s sit on the promontory with two more a little further inland. Eleven of the round barrows were excavated; three by Bushe Fox in 1911<U+2013>12 and eight by Harold St George Gray in 1919 and 1922.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p23" /><ref name=Pastscape>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=458783|work=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> Two appear to be undisturbed. Numerous finds including Early Bronze Age axes and cremation urns were recovered from these tumuli, which have been consistently found to be between 3500 and 4000 years old.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p23" />
One of the barrows (south of where the thatched barn now stands)<ref name=hhbronze>{{cite web|title=The Bronze Age|url=http://www.hengistburyhead.org/nature/bronzeage.html|publisher=Hengistbury Head Supporters Group|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> contained a high status cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a [[halberd]]-style pendant made from [[amber]] and copper [[alloy]], and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p21,82">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=21,82}}</ref>
The burial-goods recovered are similar to those of the [[Wessex culture]], the Wilsford and [[The Ridgeway|Dorset Ridgeway]] series in particular.<ref name=hhbronze />
An urn from one of the barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as ''Trevisker ware'', a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p25">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=25}}</ref>

===Iron Age===
[[File:Double Dykes, Hengistbury Head - geograph.org.uk - 10327.jpg|thumb|"Double Dykes", Hengistbury Head]]
In around 700 BC, a settlement on the Head was established;<ref name= "Cunliffe.p26-28">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=26-28}}</ref> also around this time, the headland was cut off from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the ''Double Dykes'', similar to those found at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]].<ref name= "Cunliffe.p35">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=35}}</ref> The earthworks consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits of sand and a gradual silting process.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p33">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=33}}</ref> These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area which seems to have grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port.<ref name= "Hoodless.p24">{{harvnb|Hoodless|2005|p=24}}</ref> The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a small chain of fortified earthworks, starting from [[Hambledon Hill]], and also including [[Hod Hill]], [[Spetisbury]] Rings, Buzbury Rings, [[Badbury Rings]] and Dudsbury Camp.<ref name="Jardine 1985">{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David E. C.|title=Hill Forts of the Stour Valley|year=1985|publisher=Bournemouth Local Studies Publications}}</ref>

John Lavender of the local Red House Museum noted evidence of small [[Smelting#Early_iron_smelting|iron-ore smelting]] hearths on [[Warren Hill, Dorset|Warren Hill]], while green [[slag|vitreous slag]] has been also found on the Head.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p40">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=40}}</ref> In his 1911 to 1912 excavations, Bushe-Fox found evidence for working of lead, copper and silver; two [[ingots]] discovered at this time revealed that raw materials would have been imported to the area.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p40" /> One ingot was of nearly pure copper, while the other, which weighed 8.6&nbsp;kg, was roughly 50/50 copper-silver [[alloy]] with around one percent gold.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p41" />  Argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) copper was refined to produce silver at the Head.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p41">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=41}}</ref> There are also indications that gold was worked at Hengistbury.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p42">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=42}}</ref> One excavation produced part of a [[torc]], twisted together with a small gold bracelet and another fragment in a manner suggesting it was scrap; a different site produced a streaked [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] indicating use in gold testing.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p42" />

Thousands of bronze coins have been found from the pre-Roman period, the vast majority having been struck by the [[Durotriges]].<ref name= "Cunliffe.p44">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=44}}</ref> The abundance of coins, together with various hearths and smelting artefacts found within a close proximity suggest that the Durotrigan finds were minted here.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p45,47">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=45, 47}}</ref>

====International trade centre====

The advanced level of [[metallurgy]] in the area, coupled with its ease of access from the Continent, meant that Hengistbury Head became a significant Late-Iron Age port; trading worked metal of iron, silver, and bronze in return for figs, glass, tools and other goods. [[Armorica]]n coins and pottery uncovered here show links to the [[Brittany|Brittany peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |editor-last=Todd |editor-first=Malcolm |title= A Companion to Roman Britain |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PPfZCqRytugC&dq=hengistbury+coins&q=page+4#v=onepage&q=page%204&f=false |accessdate=20 March 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons. |isbn=0-236-40125-4 |page=4}}</ref> [[Amphorae]] used for the transportation of North Italian wine have been found in such quantities (more than all other sites in the south of England put together), that it is clear that the Head was a main port of entry into the country.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p67">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=67}}</ref> However, no similar amphorae have been unearthed in Armorica, hinting at a more direct trade route between Hengistbury Head and Italy.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p67" /> Most of these vessels date from before 50 B.C., while later styles are absent despite being common in other parts of Britain, indicating the wine trade seems to have declined at about the time [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] began his [[Julius_Caesar#Conquest_of_Gaul|Gaulish campaigns]].<ref name= "Cunliffe.p77">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=77}}</ref>

===Roman occupation to Medieval period===
After the Roman conquest, the south-east of England started to develop into a more urban economy, while the socio-economic system of the south-west remained little changed.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p79">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=79}}</ref>
Hengistbury would still have served as an important hub for the [[Dumnonii]] of Cornwall and Devon, and the Durotriges of Wiltshire and Dorset; since transport by water was more efficient at the time, and the Head offered both a coastal route, and freshwater options via the [[River Stour, Dorset|Stour]] and [[River Avon (Hampshire)|Avon]] rivers.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p79" />

No evidence of Saxon use has been found at the Head.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p81">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=81}}</ref>
The area was not substantially reoccupied until [[Alfred the Great]] decided to rebuild the [[Christchurch Harbour|harbour]] as a defence against raiders.  He built the town that later became [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], on the north side of the harbour.  Access to [[Salisbury]] up the River Avon made this a more strategic place.  The Head may have been used for harbour defense at this time. In the 11th century, some of the iron-ore rich stones found at the Head were used in the construction of [[Christchurch Castle]]. These reddish-coloured stones can still be seen in the base of the now ruined castle.<ref name=hhcp>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Coastal Protection and Erosion|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/hengistbury-head-coastal.php|publisher=Bill Rees|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>

===17th, 18th and 19th centuries===
In the late 1600s, Andrew Yarranton (with backing from [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|the Earl of Clarendon]]) commenced a scheme to improve the harbour.  In 1693 a channel was cut out to sea, whilst [[ironstone]] boulders from the head were used to create a pier.<ref name="royhodges">{{cite book |url=http://www.royhodges.co.uk/Man%20and%20the%20Christchurch%20Avon%201963.pdf|page=3|last=Cross|first=D. A. E. |year=1963 |title=Man and the Christchurch Avon}}</ref> The plans proved ineffective; the pier was poorly positioned and subsequent storms (including the [[Great Storm of 1703]]) soon undid most of the work although parts of the pier known as "Clarendon's Jetty" or the "Long Rocks" are still visible today.<ref name=hh17th>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head in the 17th Century|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/hengistbury-head-17-century.php|first=Bill |last=Rees|year=2011|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> Many tons may have been removed from the beach and the head itself to make the jetty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/hengistbury-head-history.php|title=Hengistbury Head History: Overview|last=Rees|first=Bill|year=2011}}</ref>

In 1733 a new Excise and Customs Bill was introduced, restricting imports and raising taxes on many luxury items. Christchurch rapidly became a hot-bed for [[Smuggling|smugglers]], where they were known as "freetraders", and much of the town was involved in the trade. The "Double Dykes" is said to have been used to hide contraband,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/hengistbury-head-18-century.php |title=18th century at the Head|first=Bill|last=Rees|year=2011}}</ref> while Mudeford spit is rumoured to have been used in the construction of "Guinea boats" (cheaply built [[galleys]] sometimes capable of outrunning the day's steamships).<ref name="theblackhouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.theblackhouse.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=36|title=Black House Holiday Apartments: History at the Black House}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smuggling.co.uk/gazetteer_se.html |first=Richard|last=Platt |title=Smugglers Britain, Guide-Book: South-East England''}}</ref> One apocryphal story is that the black house acquired its distinctive black colour when customs officers tried to smoke out some holed-up smugglers by lighting fires around the base.<ref name="theblackhouse" /> The house was constructed in 1848 and used by shipwrights as a dwelling and workshop, smuggling was in decline with the introduction of a free trade policy and more effective measures being implemented by the Coast Guard by this time, so the house may not in fact have had much involvement in smuggling. The spit has a long association with shipbuilding with two large ships being built in the mid 19th century, the "Viscountess Canning" of 193 tons and the "Enterprise" 253 tons.<ref name=ManagementPlan/>

From 1848 to 1872, the Hengistbury Mining Company<U+2014>formed by a Christchurch-based merchant, John E. Holloway<U+2014>extracted many more ironstone boulders through quarrying. Holloway brought coal from [[Southampton]], and took the ironstone as ballast for the return journey.<ref>First section of information sign posted at Quarry Pool</ref> These boulders, known as Iron Doggers, were prized for their high quantity of iron ore (up to 30%).<ref name="Cross">{{cite book |url=http://www.royhodges.co.uk/Man%20and%20the%20Christchurch%20Avon%201963.pdf|page=7|last=Cross|first=D. A. E. |year=1963 |title=Man and the Christchurch Avon}}</ref>   They form the base of Hengistbury Head, and the removal of a substantial amount of doggers over the years has weakened the headland. These and earlier excavations resulted in a loss of up to a third of the Head, caused mainly by erosion after the quarry's closure. The silt being washed down also threatened the ecology of the saltmarsh below. This has been reduced by the building of a dam, in 1976, to create a pool. Many "doggers" can still be seen lining the route of the land-train and at the quarry.<ref name="Cross" />

===UK's first airshow===
In 1910 the first international [[Air show|aviation meeting]] ever held in Britain took place on a specially laid out [[aerodrome]] consisting of a mile of grassland between the "Double Dykes" and the nearby village of Tuckton. About twenty pioneer aviators from around the world participated in various competitions including spot landing, altitude tests and speed trials (both for the fastest and slowest circuit).<ref name="dorsetlife">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2008/07/bournemouths-flying-circuses/ |title=Bournemouth's flying circuses |journal=Dorset Life|first=John|last=Walker|issue=July|year=2008}}</ref>

On the second day of the meeting, co-founder of [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and pioneer aviator [[Charles Rolls]] was thrown from his plane, which disintegrated beneath him. Despite the fact that the [[History_of_aviation#The_Wright_brothers|first-ever powered flight]] had occurred only seven years previously, Rolls had been attempting a precision landing. He died from his injuries shortly after his fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/hengistbury-head-20-century.php |title=Hengistbury Head from the Romans to the 20th Century|first=Bill|last=Rees|year=2011}}</ref>
The event was Britain's earliest fatal flying accident involving a powered aircraft.<ref name="dorsetlife" />

===20th century===
There were a number of development schemes for the head including a major railway and docks scheme proposed in 1885, proposals for housing and a golf course were also put forward before [[World War I]], though none of these schemes came to fruition.<ref name= "Hoodless.p66-80">{{harvnb|Hoodless|2005|p=66-80}}</ref>  In 1919 the head was sold by Sir George Meyrick to [[Harry Gordon Selfridge]] with plans to construct a grand house. These plans also came to nothing, apart from the establishment of a nursery garden.<ref name= "Hoodless.p47-50">{{harvnb|Hoodless|2005|p=47-50}}</ref> [[Bournemouth Borough Council]] purchased the head in 1930 for <U+00A3>25,200,<ref name= "Hoodless.p73">{{harvnb|Hoodless|2005|p=73}}</ref> although plans for housing existed west of double dykes, the head itself was to be kept as public open space. During [[World War II]] the head was closed to the public and was occupied by the army, with a number of installations including a [[radar station]].  The area was also extensively [[Land mine|mined]]. The Head was finally cleared of the military defences by the 1950s.<ref name= "Hoodless.p109-119">{{harvnb|Hoodless|2005|p=109-119}}</ref>

Hengistbury Head [[Local Nature Reserve]] is currently owned and managed by [[Bournemouth Borough Council]]. In 1990, the land was declared a Local Nature Reserve, as a commitment by the town of Bournemouth to conserve and enhance the environment.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.hengistburyhead.org/ Hengistbury Head Nature Reserve, hengistburyhead.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The heathland forms part of the [[Dorset Heaths]] and is internationally protected as a [[Special Area of Conservation]] and [[Special Protection Area]]. Nearby, the upper reaches of Christchurch Harbour (including the meadows at Wick) are recognized as an [[Environmentally Sensitive Area]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The head today is used for a variety of reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all over the head due to the well defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the [[Bournemouth Coast Path]].<ref name="Southwest Trains">{{cite web|title=Bournemouth to Lymington Town walk|url=http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/uploads/bournemouthtolymingtontownwalk.pdf|publisher=Southwest Trains|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> In 2008, many paths were resurfaced, making more (though not all) parts of the Head [[wheelchair accessible]]. For example, it is now possible to gain wheelchair access to Quarry Pool. Regular field trips to the site are made by students of all ages and there are occasional guided tours or meetings around the Head covering a wide variety of subjects.<ref name=hhcouncil />

There is a cafe at the bottom of the Head on the Bournemouth side. Hengistbury Head Outdoor Education centre is located near here on the south shore of the harbour. Run by [[Brockenhurst College]], the centre offers a variety of water and outdoor activities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hengistburyoutdoorcentre.co.uk/ | publisher=[[Brockenhurst College]]|title = Hengistbury Head outdoor education centre &#124;}}</ref> A scenic [[Trackless train|land train]] (known as "the Noddy train") makes regular journeys from the cafe to the end of the spit, a journey of ten or so minutes. On the head itself is a [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|H. M. Coastguard]] radio relay station, a [[nature reserve]] and a [[triangulation pillar]], shown on [[Ordnance Survey map]]s as 36 metres above sea level. Ample parking (subject to charges) can be found near the cafe, but the Head is also within walking distance of [[Southbourne, Dorset|Southbourne]] and parts of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].

The '''Quarry Pool''' is now a significant part of the nature reserve features of the Head.  While it was very acidic in the early years, since 1990 it has allowed the growth of a significant number of plant and insect species, as well as [[Mallard]] and [[Little Grebe]].  The insects provide valuable food for migrating [[Sand Martin]]s and [[Swallow]]s.<ref>Second section of information sign posted at Quarry Pool</ref>

The centre will house a new display area concerning the site's archaeology, ecology and geology,<ref name=hhvscouncil>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Visitor Centre|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/LeisureCultureLibraries/Parks/ProjectsandConsultations/Projects/HengistburyHeadVisitorCentre.aspx|publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> while work space will be created for volunteers and other community groups such as the Hengistbury Head Supporters Group, Residents' Association and Christchurch Harbour Ornithological Group.<ref name=hhcouncil /> The public will have the chance to scrutinize a selection of the finds discovered at Hengistbury Head in the last century, and to interact with experienced staff, as well as providing them with the opportunity to become actively involved in the administration of the nature reserve.<ref name=hhvscouncil />

The surrounding area will be extensively landscaped to create outdoor learning areas and a wildlife garden.<ref name=layout>{{cite web|title=Design Layout|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/IMAGELIBRARY/Leisure/ParksandCountryside/Designlayout.jpg|publisher=[[Bournemouth Borough Council]]|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> Energy-saving features will include [[solar panels|photovoltaic panels]] for electricity and [[Geothermal_heat_pump#Ground_heat_exchanger|ground source heat pump]] for heating. A [[green roof]] (a living roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium), will be used to absorb rainfall and provide insulation.<ref name="bbcjan13" /> The centre will be constructed using timber-frame walls [[Straw-bale construction|insulated with straw bales]].<ref name="bbcjan13" />

==Geography==
According to Ian West of [[Southampton University]], "Hengistbury Head is the best part of the Bournemouth coast for geology and [[geomorphology]]&nbsp;.... [and] is geologically important for the unusual nodules of [[siderite|sideritic]] [[ironstone]] [found] in Middle [[Eocene]] [[strata]]."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/Hengistbury-Head-Geology.htm |title=Hengistbury Head Geology, Dorset |first=Ian|last=West|year=2012}}</ref> The exposed and relatively untouched cliff face at the Head perfectly lends itself to students of [[stratigraphy]]. [[Warren Hill, Dorset|Warren Hill]] itself is composed of Tertiary [[Bracklesham Beds]],<ref name= "Cunliffe.p11">{{harvnb|Cunliffe|1978|p=11}}</ref> a mixture of clays and [[marls]] with overlying sandy and [[lignite|lignitic]] [[Bed (geology)|beds]].

===Erosion===
One serious threat to the future of the Head is [[erosion]] of the exposed southern cliff face from wind and rain, as well as erosion caused by the sea primarily through the process of [[Longshore drift]]. A comparison of [[Ordnance Survey]] maps reveals that 25 metres of cliff was washed away from 1915 to 1962,<ref name= "Cunliffe.p11" /> a process accelerated by the Bournemouth cliff's concreted promenade and [[groyne]]s, construction of which started in the early 20th century. It is thought that in the last 200 years around 150 metres of land has been lost from the Head.<ref name= "Cunliffe.p11" /> The first attempt to counteract erosion came in the 1930s when Bournemouth Council constructed a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] now known as "the Long Groyne".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/hengistbury-head-20-century.php |title=Hengistbury Head in the 20th century|first=Bill|last=Rees|year=2011}}</ref> Since then, a [[gabion]] [[revetment]] has been constructed to secure the weakest point at the eastern end of the Head.<ref name=hhcp /> In a long-term project to secure the Head's future, from 2005 to 2008 Poole Bay was replenished with 1.8 million cubic metres of beach material,<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://www.poolebay.net/ Poole Bay Coastal Management | Coast Protection | Flood Defence | Swanage Poole Bournemouth Christchurch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> drawing ire from some surfers and beach lovers owing to the increase in sharp stones on Southbourne beach in particular.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rees|first=Ceri|date=9 November 2006|title=Replenished beach 'now a disaster'|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/1011069.Replenished_beach____now_a_disaster___/|publisher=''Daily Echo''|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> The project's organizers, the Poole Bay Partnership, state that: "The resulting wide beaches have been a success in terms of their function as a coast protection structure and for the enjoyment they provide to the area's residents and visitors."<ref name=autogenerated7 />

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Bufo calamita.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Natterjack]] toad (''Bufo calamita''), the UK's rarest [[amphibian]]]]
Hengistbury Head forms part of the Christchurch Harbour [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI), and in May 1990 was declared a Local Nature Reserve.<ref name="twobays" /> The Head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight [[IUCN Red List|red data book]] species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces [[Christchurch Harbour]], and is contiguous with the [[reed beds]] of [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick Fields]]. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the [[heathland]] on [[Warren Hill, Dorset|Warren Hill]] to freshwater ponds, [[sand dunes]], and [[salt marshes]]. The [[woodland]] (known as [[Withybed Wood]]) is home to [[Quercus robur|English oak]] and [[silver birch]] amongst many other trees, and is of particular interest, as it is the only such area to be shown on an 1811 [[Ordinance Survey|O.S.]] map of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area.<ref name="twobays">{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Management Plan|url=http://www.twobays.net/pdf/Hengistbury%20Head%20Management%20Plan%20October%202005.pdf|publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as "Barn Field". This, combined with [[gorse]] eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.<ref name=MP11>{{cite web|title=Hengistbury Head Management Plan January 2011|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/LeisureCultureLibraries/Parks/Bournemouths-Countryside/LocalNatureReserves/ManagementPlans/HengistburyHeadManagementplan2011DRAFT.pdf|publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>

Present on the site is Sea knotgrass (''Polygonum maritimum''), the rarest of the [[knotgrass]]es in Britain,<ref name=Kew>{{cite web|title=''Polygonum maritimum'' (sea knotgrass)|url=http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Polygonum-maritimum.htm|publisher=Kew Gardens|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> and currently listed as a "schedule 8 species" under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Such plants are afforded greater than usual protection against damaging activities <U+2013> such as "cutting, picking, destroying or selling."<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/wild-plants-dangerous-invasive-and-protected-species Wild plants: dangerous, invasive and protected species <U+2013> Detailed guidance <U+2013> GOV.UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The heathland is both a [[Special Area of Conservation]] and a [[Special Protection Area]], part of a network of the best wildlife sites in Europe.<ref name="twobays" /><br />
[[File:Lycaenidae - Callophrys rubi.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The [[Green Hairstreak]], (''Callophrys rubi'')]]
The various habitats provide homes to numerous species of insects. There are 700 moth species recorded in the nature reserve, again a quarter of the national total. At different spots across the site [[butterflies]] (including the [[Green Hairstreak]]),<ref>[http://www.hengistburyhead.org/nature/woodland.html Hengistbury Head.org, Nature, Woodland.]</ref> [[damselflies]] (like the [[Large Red Damselfly|Large Red]]), and [[dragonflies]] (such as the [[Hairy Dragonfly|"Hairy"]]) can be observed.<ref name=hhcouncil /><ref name="twobays" /><ref name=odanata>{{cite web|title=Christchurch Harbour Odonata List|url=http://www.chog.org.uk/Features/Odonata%20List.htm|publisher=Christchurch Harbour Ornithological Group|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> The exceedingly rare thirteen-spotted [[ladybird]] (''Hippodamia 13-punctata''), was recently observed at the Head, the first recorded UK sighting since 1952.<ref name="twobays" />

Over 300 bird species have been recorded in the area,<ref name=harbourlist>{{cite web|title=Harbour List|url=http://chog.org.uk/Pages/Harbour%20List.htm|publisher=Christchurch Harbour Ornithological Group}}</ref> making Hengistbury Head an important migratory point. The [[Balearic Shearwater]], considered critically endangered with extinction by the [[IUCN]] and seldom sighted in the UK, has been seen in the area.<ref name=harbourlist /> Other rare birds spotted here include the [[Purple Heron]], the [[Pink-footed Goose]], the [[European Honey Buzzard]] and the [[Melodious Warbler]] to name but a few.<ref name=rarities>{{cite web|title=Rarities|url=http://www.chog.org.uk/Harbour%20List%20Sub%20Pages/Rarities.htm|publisher=Christchurch Harbour Ornithological Group|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> The fields and reserved areas near the car park provide an ideal spot to watch and listen to a significant population of [[Skylark]]s during the summer months.

In 1989 a project commenced to re-introduce the country's rarest amphibian, the [[Natterjack Toad]], to Hengistbury Head. The Natterjack was last recorded on the headland in the 1950s before its extinction, likely the result of lack of suitable ponds.<ref name=ponds>{{cite web|title=Ponds|url=http://www.hengistburyhead.org/nature/ponds.html|publisher=Hengistbury Head Supporters Group|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> The project has been a great success and today there are thriving populations at various locations.<ref name=ponds /> The ideal time to witness their mating rituals is in May as dusk approaches, when the distinctive call of the Natterjack can be heard for miles around.<ref>{{cite web|title=Natterjack toad|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Natterjack_Toad|publisher=BBC Nature|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>
