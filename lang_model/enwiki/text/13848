'''{{nihongo|Ishikawa Toyonobu|<U+77F3><U+5DDD><U+8C4A><U+4FE1>|extra=1711-1785}}''' was a Japanese ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[Woodblock printing in Japan|print]] artist. He is sometimes said to have been the same person as [[Nishimura Shigenobu]], a contemporary ''ukiyo-e'' artist and student of [[Nishimura Shigenaga]] about whom very little is known.

A pupil of Nishimura Shigenaga, Toyonobu produced many monochrome "lacquer prints" (''[[urushi-e]]'') which reflected the influence of [[Okumura Masanobu]] as well. Many of these were ''[[yakusha-e]]'' (actor prints) and ''[[bijinga]]'' (images of beautiful women), including images of standing [[courtesan]]s, whose faces conveyed an impassivity typical of the works of the [[Kaigetsud<U+014D> school]].

Toyonobu also experimented with semi-nude forms, something his chief predecessors also did, but never succeeded in developing it into a trend or sub-genre within ''ukiyo-e''. Art historian [[Richard Lane]] points out that these images, depicting women with the top half of their kimono open and let down to reveal their chests, were intended as suggestive and erotic, and were not "glorification of the human form such as we find in [[Hellenistic art|Greek art]]<ref>Lane. p89.</ref>."

Later in his career, Toyonobu became one of the leading producers of color prints, chiefly ''[[benizuri-e]]'' ("rose prints"), but stopped producing ''ukiyo-e'' shortly after [[Suzuki Harunobu]] pioneered the full-color print (''[[nishiki-e]]'') in 1765.

He had one notable pupil, [[Ishikawa Toyomasa]], who is known chiefly for his depictions of children at play, and who may have been Toyonobu's son.
