The '''Bristol Bulldog''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] single-seat [[biplane]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] designed during the 1920s by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]].  Over 400 Bulldogs  were produced for the [[RAF]] and overseas customers, and it was one of the most famous aircraft used by the RAF during the inter-war period.
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Background==
The design of the Bulldog was the outcome of a series of design studies for fighter undertaken by [[Frank Barnwell]] during the 1920's. In 1924 Barnwell had started work on a fighter powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Falcon]] to meet the requirements of specification F.17/24.  The project was shelved since Bristol preferred to use their own engine designs, but was revived in 1926 when Barnwell started work on a design, designated the Bristol 102, to meet either F.9/26 for a day and night fighter or N.21/26 for a shipborne fighter.  The Type 105 designation was  first applied to a subsequent proposal for another aircraft to meet F.9/26 powered by the [[Bristol Mercury|Mercury]] engine then under development at Bristol.  These proposals looked promising enough  for a pair of mock-ups to be constructed for inspection by the Air Ministry in February 1927. The two aircraft were similar in design, the interceptor to specification F.17/24 design being slightly smaller and lighter and not equipped with radio. As a result Bristol were asked to revise the design so that it met a later interceptor specification, F.20/27.  Subsequently, a prototype aircraft, now designated the [[Bristol Bullpup|Type 107 Bullpup]] was ordered for evaluation, but the other design did not gain official backing.  Nevertheless Bristol considered it promising enough to build a prototype to be entered for the F.9/26 trials as a private venture, powered by a [[Bristol Jupiter]] because the supply of Mercurys was expected to be limited.<ref name="Barnes p212"/>

==Design and development==
The Type 105 was an unequal span [[interplane struts|single bay]] biplane powered by a supercharged [[Bristol Jupiter|Bristol Jupiter VII]] air-cooled radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller.  The structure was all-metal with a fabric covering, using members built up from rolled high-tensile steel strips riveted together.  In order to ensure the maximum field of view there was a large semi-circular cutout in the trailing edge of the upper wing and the inboard section of the lower was of reduced [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. [[Frise aileron]]s were fitted to the top wing only.  It was armed with a pair of 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) Vickers machine guns mounted either side of the cockpit.<ref name="Aeroaug91 p460-1">Lumsden ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1991, pp. 460<U+2013>461.</ref><ref name="Barnes 212-3">Barnes 1964, pp. 212<U+2013>213.</ref>   

The prototype Bulldog first flew on 17 May 1927.  Initial testing was entirely satisfactory and it was delivered to [[RAF Martlesham Heath]] in June.<ref name="Mason p193">Mason 1992, p. 193.</ref>  After initial consideration of all the types entered to meet the specification, the Bulldog and the [[Hawker Hawfinch]] were selected for more detailed evaluation.<ref name="Mason p194"/>  While the Bulldog's manoeuvrability and strength were praised by the RAF,<ref name="Barnes p213">Barnes 1964, p. 213.</ref> it had poor spinning recovery properties.  This was solved by fitting an enlarged fin and rudder, but this modification led to difficulties in taxying cross-wind.  

Accordingly, a second prototype with a lengthened rear fuselage was ordered for further evaluation in comparison with the Hawfinch. In this form, designated the Type 105A or Bulldog Mk. II was first flown by [[Cyril Uwins]] on 21 January 1928 and shortly afterward, delivered to Martlesham Heath. Performance was so close to that of the Hawfinch that a decision was deferred until the aircraft had been evaluated by service pilots; the eventual choice of the Bulldog was made largely because it was easier to maintain.<ref name="Barnes p214">Barnes 1964, p. 214</ref><ref name="Mason p194">Mason 1992, p. 194.</ref> An initial contract for 25 aircraft was placed:  Bristol accordingly laid down 26 airframes, the additional example being intended as a company demonstration aircraft.  The first of these were delivered on 8 May 1929 and deliveries were complete by 10 October.

Later production aircraft were of a refined version designated the '''Mk. IIA'''.  This had revised wing spars and a stronger fuselage and was powered by the uprated Jupiter VII F. One production aircraft was modified for use as an advanced trainer: after evaluation by the [[Central Flying School]] at [[RAF Upavon|Upavon]] this was ordered by the RAF, the production aircraft differing from the prototype in having slightly swept wings and an enlarged fin to improve spin recovery characteristics.<ref>Barnes 1966, pp. 219<U+2013>220.</ref>

==Operational history==
The Bulldog never saw combat with the RAF, although during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935<U+2013>36, Bristol Bulldogs were sent to the [[Sudan]] to reinforce [[Middle East Command]]. [[Douglas Bader]], better known for his Second World War actions, lost both of his legs when his Bristol Bulldog crashed while he was performing unauthorised [[Aerobatics]] at Woodley airfield near Reading. 

The Bulldog was withdrawn from [[RAF Fighter Command]] in July 1937, being primarily replaced by the [[Gloster Gauntlet]].<ref name=fc>Delve 2008, pp. 248<U+2013>253.</ref> The Bulldog's RAF career was not over though, for the type continued to serve for a few years with Service Flying Training Schools.<ref name=fc/>

The Bulldog proved to be quite a successful export to foreign air forces, seeing service with [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[Latvia]], [[Siam]] and [[Sweden]]. 

In 1936, Latvia, keen to replace its elderly Bulldogs with more modern aircraft, sold 11 Bulldogs to [[Basque nationalist]] forces; becoming part of the [[Spanish Republican Air Force]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], they remained in use until the [[Battle of Santander]].<ref name="Breed p91-2">''Air Enthusiast'' February 1973, pp. 91<U+2013>92.</ref> Nineteen Bulldogs also saw combat as part of the [[Finnish Air Force]] during the [[Winter War]] against the [[Soviet Union]], which began in 1939. The Bulldogs fought well against their Soviet opponent, gaining six kills by five pilots for the loss of one of their own,<ref name="Backwoods">Perttula, Pentti.

Retrieved: 27 June 2009.</ref> the types shot down being two [[Polikarpov I-16]]s and four [[Tupolev SB]]s,<ref name="Backwoods"/> both of which were superior in terms of technology compared to the Bulldog. The first aerial victory of the Finnish Air Force was achieved by a Bulldog piloted by SSgt Toivo Uuttu on 1 December 1939,<ref name="Finnish biplane fighter aces - Toivo Uuttu">Gustavsson, H<U+00E5>kan.
