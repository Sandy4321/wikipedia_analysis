==Early life==
Prior to competing in [[Miss Spain]], Rever<U+00F3>n was and working as a model and completing her studies in [[Technical Architecture]].<ref name="miss spain"/>

==Miss Tenerife==
Rever<U+00F3>n, who stands {{height|m=1.78}} tall, competed as Miss Maxarco in her province's local beauty pageant [[Tenerife|Miss Tenerife]], held in [[Icod de los Vinos]], placing first runner-up to [[Puerto de la Cruz|Miss Puerto de la Cruz]], Marta Dom<U+00ED>nguez.<ref name="tenerife06"/> However, Dom<U+00ED>nguez resigned to pursue dreams as a singer, and Rever<U+00F3>n took over the title of ''Miss Tenerife 2006''.<ref name="miss spain"/>

==Miss Spain==
As the official representative of her [[Tenerife|province]] in the 2007 [[Miss Spain]] pageant, Rever<U+00F3>n placed first runner-up to eventual ''Miss Espa<U+00F1>a 2007'', [[Natalia Zabala]] of [[Gipuzkoa]]. At some point in the competition, Rever<U+00F3>n was even ahead of the winner, and only 7 points separated her from the crown, placing first runner-up for the second consecutive time.<ref name="miss spain"/>

==Life after Miss Tenerife==
In October 2007, Rever<U+00F3>n finished her reign as [[Tenerife|Miss Tenerife]] and, as the first runner-up to [[Miss Spain|Miss Spain 2007]], she hadn't competed in any international pageant. At first, she was going to participate in [[Miss Europe]], but the pageant was not organized in 2007. 

===Miss Earth 2008===
However, a year later, she was selected to participate in [[Miss Earth 2008]], where she was announced as one of Top 16 semifinalists who moved forward to compete for the title. She achieved one of the eight highest swimsuit scores, which allowed her to advance to the next stage of the pageant and participate in the evening gown competition, finishing her participation in [[Miss Earth 2008]] as one of the Top 8 finalists.<ref name="economista"/>

===Miss Universe 2010===
A couple of years later, a special competition was put together by the [[Miss Spain]] organization to select [[Spain]]'s representative to [[Miss Universe]], since the gala event for [[Miss Spain 2010]] was pushed back to September, a month after the Miss Universe telecast. Destiny would be on Rever<U+00F3>n's side, as she was selected to represent her [[Spain|country]] in the 2010 [[Miss Universe 2010|Miss Universe]] pageant, and was considered one of the favorites of the competition broadcast live from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on August 23rd.<ref name="economista"/>

After traveling for the first time to the [[United States]] and ending her 16-day-long participation in Miss Universe, she returned to Spain to rest and continue with her life. When asked if she would like to repeat the experience, she said "Yes, I would."<ref name="opinion"/>
