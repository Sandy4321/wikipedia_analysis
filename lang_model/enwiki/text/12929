During his first two terms as President, Lukashenko restructured the Belarusian economy by introducing economic integration with the [[Russian Federation]] and building strong ties with countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

==Early life and career (1954 - 1994)==
Lukashenko was born on 30 August 1954 in the settlement of [[Kopys]] in the [[Vitebsk voblast]] of the [[Belorussian SSR|Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. It has been alleged in the media that Lukashenko is of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] origin (his maternal grandfather Trofym Lukashenko was from the [[Sumy Oblast]]).<ref name='famorigin'>{{cite news | first=<U+0412><U+0438><U+043A><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440> | last=<U+041C><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+0448><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> | coauthors= <U+0423><U+043B><U+044C><U+044F><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0411><U+043E><U+0431><U+043E><U+0435><U+0434> |authorlink= | title=<U+0412> <U+041C><U+0438><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A> <U+0438><U+0437> <U+041A><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+044B> <U+043B><U+0435><U+0442><U+0438><U+0442> <U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+044E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043F><U+043B><U+0435><U+043C><U+044F><U+043D><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A> <U+041B><U+0443><U+043A><U+0430><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E> | date=2003-08-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.charter97.org/rus/news/2003/08/15/rodstvennik | work =<U+041A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0441><U+043E><U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0430><U+0432><U+0434><U+044B> <U+0432> <U+0411><U+0435><U+043B><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0438> | pages = | accessdate = 2008-12-28 | language = Russian }}</ref> Lukashenko grew up without a father in his childhood, leading him to be taunted by his schoolmates for having an unmarried mother.<ref name='telegraph08'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Alexander Lukashenko: Dictator with a difference | date=2008-09-25 | publisher=Telegraph Media Group | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/profiles/3080936/Alexander-Lukashenko-Dictator-with-a-difference.html | work =Telegraph.co.uk | pages = | accessdate = 2008-12-26 | language = | location=London}}</ref> He graduated from the [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]] Pedagogical Institute in 1975 and the Belarussian Agricultural Academy in 1985.

In 1990, Lukashenko was elected as a Deputy in the [[Supreme Council]] of the Republic of Belarus.

Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption,<ref name='nytimes'/> Lukashenko was elected in 1993 to serve as the chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament.<ref name='nytimes'/> In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials of corruption, including stealing state funds for personal purposes including [[Stanislav Shushkevich]]. The Speaker of Parliament, Shushkevich lost a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]] and resigned. Some believe that the vague nature of the charges indicates they were merely a pretext for removing Shushkevich, who had become increasingly unpopular among the conservative parliamentary majority.<ref>Prof. David R Maples.

A new [[Constitution of Belarus|Belarusian constitution]] enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential elections in July. Six candidates stood, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform of "defeat[ing] the mafia." Shushkevich and [[Vyacheslav Kebich]] also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favourite. Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, [[Zyanon Paznyak]] received 12.9% and Shushkevich received 9.9%<ref>Stewart Parker, "The Last Soviet Republic: Alexander Lukashenko's Belarus", 2007, page 62 (ISBN 142513527-7_</ref>.

==President of Belarus==
===First term (1994-2001)===
In May 1995, one of the first votes under Lukashenko occurred. Not only were the national symbols of the country changed, it also gave Lukashenko the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree.<ref>Central Elections Committee of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.rec.gov.by/refer/refer1995.html 1995 Referendum Questions] {{ru icon}}</ref> In the summer of 1996, 70 deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution.<ref>CNN [http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/19/belarus/ Concern grows over Belarus power struggle]. Published 19 November 1996.</ref> Shortly after that a referendum was held on 24 November 1996 in which 4 questions were offered by Lukashenko and 3 questions offered by a group of Parliament members.

Updated 14 October 2004.</ref>  By most accounts, the new constitution turned his presidency into a legal dictatorship.

After the referendum, Lukashenko convened a new parliamentary assembly from those members of the parliament who were loyal to him. After 12 deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about 40 deputies of the old parliament were left behind by Lukashenko, but they had no place to convene, since the administration closed the parliament building "for remodeling". Nevertheless, for some time, the [[European Union|EU]] and [[Council of Europe]] considered these remnants of the old parliament as the legitimate assembly.<ref>British Helsinki Human Rights Group, a 1997 report on Belarus</ref> At the start of 1998, the [[Central Bank of Russia]] suspended trading in the [[Belarusian ruble]], which led to a collapse in the value of the currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the [[National Bank of the Republic of Belarus]], the sacking of the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.<ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/68004.stm Belarus appoints new national bank chief].

Lukashenko blamed foreign governments for conspiring against him and, in April 1998, he expelled ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near [[Minsk]], offering them another building. The [[Drazdy conflict]] caused an international outcry and resulted in a travel ban on Lukashenko from the [[European Union]] and the United States.<ref>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty [http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/1998/98-07-22.rferl.html#21 EU PUNISHES BELARUSIAN LEADERSHIP].

After Lukashenko confirmed he was running for re-election in 2005, opposition groups began to seek a single candidate. On 16 October 2005, on the [[Day of Solidarity With Belarus]], the political groups [[Zubr (political organisation)|Zubr]] and Third Way Belarus encouraged all of the opposition parties to rally behind one candidate to oppose Lukashenko in the 2006 election.

Lukashenko later claimed that he had rigged the election results against himself to obtain a majority more typical of western countries. Although the results showed to him gave him 93.5 percent of the vote, he directed the government to announce a result of 86 percent. He noted that, despite promises to the contrary, even this had not satisfied his foreign critics.<ref>{{cite news |    title=<U+041B><U+0443><U+043A><U+0430><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E>: <U+041F><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0432><U+044B><U+0431><U+043E><U+0440><U+044B> <U+043C><U+044B> <U+0441><U+0444><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+0438><U+0444><U+0438><U+0446><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438> |date=2006-11-23 | publisher=BelaPAN | url =http://news.tut.by/77777.html |   accessdate = 2007-10-13 | language = Russian }}</ref> Some Russian nationalists, such as [[Dmitry Rogozin]] and the [[Movement Against Illegal Immigration]], have stated that they would like to see Lukashenko become [[President of Russia]] in 2008.

=== Third term ===
In September 2008, [[Belarusian parliamentary election, 2008|parliamentary elections were held]]. Lukashenko had allowed some opposition candidates to stand, though in the official results, opposition members failed to get a seat out of the available 110.

==Domestic policy==
Lukashenko promotes himself as a "man of the people." Due to his style of rule, he is often informally referred to as ''bat'ka'' ("[[father]]").<ref name="last"/> He was elected chairman of the [[Belarusian Olympic Committee]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noc.by/eng/nokrb/htdocs/1/ |title=NOC RB |accessdate=2007-10-13 |year=2002 |publisher=National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Belarus }}</ref> During a televised address to the nation on 7 September 2004 Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum on whether to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |    title=Observers deplore Belarus vote |date=2004-10-18 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3752930.stm |   accessdate = 2007-10-13 | language = }}</ref> Opposition groups, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[European Union]], and the [[United States State Department]] have stated that the vote "fell significantly short of international standards."

Some critics of Lukashenko use the term ''Lukashism'' (or ''lukashenkoism'') to refer to the [[political system|political]] and [[economic system]] Lukashenko has implemented in [[Belarus]]. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an [[authoritarian]] [[political ideology]] based on a [[cult of personality|cult of his personality]] and [[nostalgia]] for [[Soviet]] times among certain groups in Belarus. It is not known where the term was first used, though the earliest documented use was in 1998. The use was in the context of opening a museum to memorialize victims of Communism with a wing dedicated to Lukashism.<ref>{{cite web

Lukashenko continues to face domestic opposition from a coalition of opposition groups supported by the United States and Europe. The [[United States Congress]] has sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the [[Belarus Democracy Act of 2004]] to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition.<ref>{{cite web

Lukashenko himself commented about the criticism on him by saying: "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10&nbsp;years and we got used to it." Before the polling he said: "We are not going to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarus people who are the masters in our state." He warned that anyone joining an opposition protest would be treated as a "terrorist", adding: "We will wring their necks, as one might a duck".<ref>{{cite news

==Foreign policy==
Lukashenko<U+2019>s relationship with the EU has been strained, in part by choice and in part by his policies towards domestic opponents. Lukashenko<U+2019>s repression of opponents have earned him the moniker <U+2018>Europe<U+2019>s last dictator<U+2019> and resulted in the EU imposing visa sanctions on him and a range of Belarusian officials. However, in a shift of policy in October 2008, the EU decided temporarily to lift visa sanctions, mainly to help persuade Belarus not to recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which had been  recognized two months previous. These were renewed six months later (in 2009) and are due to expire at the end of 2009. On 16 September 2009, Lukashenko entered the EU for the second time since the temporary suspension of sanctions, to visit a Belarusian trade fair in Vilnius, Lithuania. The date coincided with the tenth anniversary of the disappearance and presumed murder of the leader of the Belarusian opposition, [[Viktar Hanchar]] (Viktor Gonchar, using the Russian spelling). 

Since the EU adopted this policy of <U+2018>change through engagement<U+2019>, it has supported the provision of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans to help stabilize the Belarusian economy. 

Supporters of the policy of <U+2018>change through engagement<U+2019> put forward a range of arguments. Firstly, the EU<U+2019>s old policy of isolating Belarus had failed to produce results. Secondly, it offers some prospect of change, though no assurance of change. Thirdly, it provides opportunities to engage in a dialogue in private and to press in public for change. Fourthly, engagement may influence people in Lukashenko<U+2019>s entourage, by exposing them to the European system and by showing that <U+2018>European values<U+2019> are real, not merely a concept or a term to disguise a political agenda.<ref>"Mr Lukashenka goes to Vilnius", by Vitali Silitski, EuropeanVoice.com, 12 October 2009 [http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2009/10/mr-lukashenka-goes-to-vilnius/66119.aspx]</ref>

== Controversial statements ==

Lukashenko has been noted for making controversial statements. He has been accused of making a remark in 1995 which praised [[Adolf Hitler]]: "The history of Germany is a copy of the history of Belarus. Germany was raised from ruins thanks to firm authority and not everything connected with that well-known figure Hitler was bad. German order evolved over the centuries and attained its peak under Hitler."<ref>{{cite news |    title= Bigotry in Belarus|date=2007-10-20 | publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]| url =http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1192380606930&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|   accessdate = 2007-11-01 | language = }}</ref>  However, this allegation was originally made by the Russian television channel NTV, on the basis of an interview which Lukashenko gave to the German newspaper "Handelsblatt", in which Hitler was not even mentioned.  The original interviewer, Dr. Markus Zeiner, said "a tape of the interview had been quoted out of context and with the sequence of comments altered by the Russian media." <ref>"The Last Soviet Republic: Alexander Lukashenko's Belarus" by Stewart Parker, published by Trafford Publishing, 2007, pages 111-112</ref> 

In October 2007 Lukashenko was accused of making blatant [[anti-Semitic]] and [[anti-Israel]] comments. Addressing the "miserable state of the city of [[Babruysk]]" on a live broadcast on state radio he stated: "This is a Jewish city,<ref>In 1926 there were 21,558 Jews in Babruysk constituting 42% of the towns population; by 1989 they numbered just over 4%. In 1999 there were 1,360 Jews among a population of 227,000. ''See [http://www.jhrgbelarus.org/AboutBelarus_articles.php Jewish Heritage Research Group in Belarus]''</ref> and the Jews are not concerned for the place they live in.
