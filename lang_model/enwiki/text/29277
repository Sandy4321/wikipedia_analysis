'''Billy Gohl''' (died 1928) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] who, while working as a [[union]] official, would [[murder]] [[sailor]]s passing through [[Aberdeen, Washington]].<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite book|last= Lane|first=Brian|coauthors= Wilfred Gregg|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|publisher=Berkley Books|pages=179|isbn= 0-425-15213-8}}</ref> He murdered for an unknown period of time and was a suspect in 41 murders until his capture in 1913.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Washington State had abolished the [[death penalty]] the year before his [[conviction]], and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Those in favor of the reinstatement of capital punishment would often cite him as an example of a [[prisoner]] who deserved to die for his crimes.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> 

== Occupation ==
Gohl was employed as a union official at the Sailor's Union of the Pacific. Before this he had been employed as a [[bartender]] after returning broke from the [[Yukon]].<ref name="Last Wilderness">{{cite book|last= Morgan|first=Murray C.|coauthors=|title=The Last Wilderness|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=122-128|isbn= 978-0670419364 }}</ref>  Already an accomplished criminal that liked to brag about his alleged crimes<ref name="Last Wilderness" />, Gohl was suspected of being responsible for the many of the large numbers of deceased [[migrant workers]] that would be found washed up on shore during his tenure as a bartender, as well as a number of other crimes.<ref name="Last Wilderness" /> As a union official, Gohl would use his reputation and intimidating size to discourage strikes and "recruit" new union members.<ref name="Last Wilderness" /> The Union building proved to be a location that was ideal for his crimes, both in providing [[victim]]s, and in concealing the [[evidence]] of their murders.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Sailors arriving in the [[port]] of Aberdeen would usually visit the Sailor's Union building soon after disembarking. There they could collect their [[mail]] and, if they wished, set some [[money]] aside in savings.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Usually the official on duty, often alone, would be Billy Gohl, who was often considered to be a friendly, solicitous individual. Typically Gohl would ask if the sailors had any [[family]] or [[friends]] in the area. Then he would turn the conversation to the topic of money and valuables. If the sailor was just passing through, and would not be missed by anyone in the area, and had more than a trivial amount of cash or valuables on hand, Gohl would choose him as his next victim.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

== Murders ==
Gohl would kill most of his victims in the union building by shooting them. Then after relieving them of their money and valuables, he would dispose of them in the Wishkah river, which ran behind the building and into the [[harbor]].<ref name="encyclopedia" /> According to some reports, there was a chute which descended from a [[trap door]] in the building directly into the river.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Other reports state that Gohl would use a small [[Launch (boat)|launch]] to murder his victims and dump the bodies directly in the harbor.<ref name="Last Wilderness" /> Though suspected of being responsible for the large numbers of sailors who would disembark in Aberdeen and not reembark, nothing was done to stop him until an [[accomplice]], John Klingenberg, was brought back to Aberdeen after trying to jump ship in [[Mexico]] to escape [[prosecution]], or possibly to escape Gohl.<ref name="encyclopedia" /><ref name="Last Wilderness" />

== Arrest ==
Klingenberg was able to testify to seeing Gohl alone with a sailor, Charles Hatberg, whose body had recently been found in the harbor, soon before his disappearance.<ref name="encyclopedia" /><ref name="Last Wilderness" /> Gohl had already been arrested for the Hatberg murder and was convicted of two counts of murder, though suspected of 41 or more,<ref name="encyclopedia" /> and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].<ref name="Last Wilderness" /> The second count was for the murder of John Hoffman, a [[witness]] to the Hatberg murder who was shot and injured by Gohl on the night of the murder, and killed the next day by Klingenberg, for which he was sentenced to twenty years.<ref name="Last Wilderness" /> Gohl was later transferred to an [[asylum]] for the criminally [[insane]] where he died in 1928.<ref name="encyclopedia" /><ref name="Last Wilderness" />
