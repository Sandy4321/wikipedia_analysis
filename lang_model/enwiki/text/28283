The '''Basilica of Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc''' is located on the Rue de Torcy and the Rue de la Chapelle in the ''quartier de la Chapelle'' of the [[18th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]]. Its design was the subject of a contentious design competetition. The winning, partially completed design was eventually scrapped in favor of a more modest modernist design.

==History==
The church was first proposed in 1914 as a [[votive offering]] for the safety of Paris during the opening stages of [[World War I]], which was attributed to the intervention of [[Joan of Arc]].<ref name="Francois1">{{cite web|url=http://hawbe.perso.neuf.fr/jda/articles/189-6.htm|title=1914 : Jeanne sauve une 2<U+00E8>me fois la France|last=Francois|first=Jacques|language=French|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> The new church was to be built next to the only Parisian church known to have been visited by Joan,<ref name="stdenys1">{{cite web|url=http://www.stdenysdelachapelle.org/spip.php?article8|title=Br<U+00E8>ve histoire de Saint-Denys de la Chapelle|date=24 March 2008|language=French|accessdate=15 December 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> the [[church of Saint-Denys de la Chapelle]], where Joan prayed one night in 1429.

In 1926 a contest was announced by the archdiocese of Paris for the design of a large church. Several designs were proposed. A design by [[Auguste Perret]] created a sensation with a 200 meter bell tower of reinforced concrete and stained glass. The Perret design was rejected in favor of a design by [[Georges Closson]].  Perret eventually used the scaled-down design for the emblematic [[St. Joseph's Church, Le Havre|church of St Joseph]] in [[Le Havre]].

Closson proposed an eclectic design dominated by towers that flanked the entry and rose until they joined in a massive [[Gothic arch]].  The [[nave]] consisted of three bays, each capped by a cupola and flanked on either side by gabled projections with round windows. A narrower apse completed the composition.<ref name="stdenys1"/>

Work began in 1930 on Closson's design, but progressed slowly and only the lower fa<U+00E7>ade was built. The proposed tower-arch was not completed and the first cupola was incorporated into a [[narthex]].  After a long pause the main church, extending into the Place de Torcy was completed in an entirely different design in [[reinforced concrete]] in 1964 under the direction of architect Pierre Isnard. Isnard's design followed Closson's footprint, but substituted a simple box covered by a folded-plate concrete roof.<ref name="stdenys1"/> The church's stained glass was executed by [[Leon Zack]], while a statue of Joan of Arc was carried out by [[Maxime Real del Sarte]].
