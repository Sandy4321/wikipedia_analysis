The '''Dagstorp Runestone''', designated as '''DR 325''' in the [[Rundata]] catalog, is a [[Viking Age]] memorial [[runestone]] that was discovered at Dagstorp, which is about two kilometers northwest of [[K<U+00E4>vlinge]], [[Scania]], [[Sweden]].

==Description==
This granite runestone was discovered broken into 104 pieces in 1910 in Dagstorp. The Dagstorp Runestone was reconstructed and is currently located at the [[Kulturen]] in [[Lund]] where it is known as the ''Dagstorpstenen''. The inscription consists of runic text within a band that forms an arch. This inscription is classified as being carved in [[runestone style]] RAK. This is the classification for those inscriptions where the ends of the runic bands are straight and do not have any attached serpent or beast heads. RAK is considered to be the oldest style. The runic text in the [[younger futhark]] indicates that the stone is a memorial placed by a man named Sigmundr in memory of his father Klakkr. The [[runemaster]], who did not sign the inscription, used a punctuation mark '''<U+00D7>''' between each word in the text.

This inscription is dated as having been carved after the [[Jelling stones]].
