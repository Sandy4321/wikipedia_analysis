The '''Northern Bald Ibis''', '''Hermit Ibis''', or '''Waldrapp''' (''Geronticus eremita'') is a migratory [[bird]] found in barren, semi-desert or rocky habitats, often close to running water. This 70<U+2013>80&nbsp;cm (28<U+2013>31&nbsp;in) glossy black [[ibis]], which, unlike other members of the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays 2<U+2013>3 eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals. 

The Northern Bald Ibis was once widespread across the [[Middle East]], northern [[Africa]], and [[southern Europe]], with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8&nbsp;million years. It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago, and is now considered [[Critically Endangered|critically endangered]]. There are believed to be about 500 wild birds remaining in southern Morocco, and fewer than 10 in Syria, where it was rediscovered in 2002. To combat these ebbing numbers, recent [[reintroduction]] programs have been instituted internationally, with a semi-wild breeding colony in Turkey, as well as sites in Austria, Spain, and northern Morocco.

The reasons for the species' long-term decline are unclear, but hunting, loss of foraging habitat, and pesticide poisoning have been implicated in the rapid loss of colonies in recent decades.

== Taxonomy ==
The ibises are gregarious, long-legged wading birds with long down-curved bills; along with the [[spoonbill]]s they form one subfamily within the [[Threskiornithidae]].<ref name=HBW>del Hoyo ''et al.'' (1992) p.472 "Threskiornithidae (Ibises and Spoonbills)"</ref> The Northern Bald Ibis' closest relative, and the only other member of the genus, is the [[Southern Bald Ibis]], ''G. calvus'', of southern Africa. The two ''Geronticus'' species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives.<ref name= BWP/><ref name=SASOL/>

The Northern Bald Ibis was described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gessner]] in his ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'' in 1555,<ref name=Gesner>Gessner (1551) pp.337<U+2013>8 "Corvo sylvatico"</ref><ref name="Yearbook09">{{cite book| title =Rare Birds Yearbook 2009| publisher =MagDig Media Limited| year =2008| location =England| pages =114<U+2013>115| isbn =978-0-9552607-5-9 }}</ref> and given the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''[[Upupa]] eremita'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1758 ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref name =linn>Linnaeus (1758) p.118 ''U. viridis, capite flavo, cervice jubata.

The species probably split into two distinct populations at least 400 years ago and, since then, the two populations have been diverging [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]], [[ecology|ecologically]], and genetically;<ref name=serraabd/> nevertheless, the Turkish and Moroccan populations of this ibis are not currently classed as separate subspecies.<ref name=iucn/> One consistent difference between the eastern and western birds is a single mutation in the [[cytochrome b]] [[gene]] of their [[mitochondrial DNA]].<ref name=Pegoraro >{{cite journal|last=Pegoraro |first=Karin |coauthors=F<U+00F6>ger, Manfred; Parson, Walther |month=October |year=2001|title=First evidence of mtDNA sequence differences between Northern Bald Ibises (''Geronticus eremita'') of Moroccan and Turkish origin |journal=Journal of Ornithology |volume=142 |issue=4 |pages=425<U+2013>28 |doi=10.1007/BF01651340}}</ref>

== Description ==
[[Image:Geronticus eremita close up 1.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an adult's head]]
The Northern Bald Ibis is a large, glossy black bird, 70<U+2013>80&nbsp;cm (28<U+2013>31&nbsp;in) long with a 125<U+2013>135&nbsp;cm (49<U+2013>53&nbsp;in) wingspan and an average weight of 1.0<U+2013>1.3&nbsp;kg (35<U+2013>46&nbsp;oz).<ref name=BWP/> The plumage is black, with bronze-green and violet iridescence, and there is a wispy ruff on the bird's hind neck. The face and head are dull red and unfeathered, and the long, curved bill and the legs are red.<ref name=BWP>Snow (1998) pp.146<U+2013>147</ref> In flight, this bird has powerful, shallow, and flexible wing beats. It gives guttural ''hrump'' and high, hoarse ''hyoh'' calls at its breeding colonies, but is otherwise silent.<ref name= Mullarney>Mullarney (1999) p.36</ref>

The sexes are similar in plumage, although males are generally larger than females,<ref name=BWP/> and, as with other ibises that breed in colonies, have longer [[Beak|bills]]. The longer-billed males are more successful in attracting a mate.<ref name= Babbitt >{{cite journal| last= Babbitt | first= Gregory A. | coauthors = Frederick, Peter C. | month= | year=2007 | title= Selection for sexual bill dimorphism in ibises: an evaluation of hypotheses. | journal= Waterbirds | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages= 199<U+2013>206 | doi = 10.1675/1524-4695(2007)30[199:SFSBDI]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> The downy chick has uniformly pale brown plumage, and the fledged juvenile resembles the adult except that it has a dark head, light grey legs, and a pale bill.

If the eastern and western populations are considered to be separable subspecies, it is unclear which should be considered to be the [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate (first-named) form]], since the first description of this species was based on a now-extinct population from Switzerland which is of unknown race.<ref name= Gesner/>

The Northern Bald Ibis is readily distinguished from its close relative, the Southern Bald Ibis of Southern Africa, by the southern species' whitish face.<ref name=SASOL>Sinclair (2002) p.74</ref> The Northern Bald can also be confused with the similarly dark-plumaged [[Glossy Ibis]], which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the Bald Ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from Glossy Ibis,<ref name=BWP/> and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the Glossy Ibis.<ref name= Mullarney/>

== Habitat and range ==
Unlike other ibises, which nest in trees and feed in wetlands, the Northern Bald Ibis breeds on undisturbed cliff ledges, and forages for food in irregularly cultivated, grazed dry areas such as semi-arid [[steppe]]s, and fallow fields. The close proximity of adequate steppe feeding areas to breeding cliffs is an important habitat requirement.<ref name=rspb2>{{cite web| title=Northern bald ibis |work=International research |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/science/international/northernbaldibis/research_details.asp |publisher = [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB)  |accessdate=16 November 2008 }}</ref>   
[[File:2011 Geronticus eremita.JPG|thumb|left|At a zoo in [[Strasbourg]]]]
The Northern Bald Ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern Europe; it bred along the [[Danube]] and [[Rhone]] Rivers, and in the mountains of Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (Gessner's original description was of a Swiss bird).<ref name=Gesner2>Gesner (1551) pp.&nbsp;337<U+2013>38 ''Eremita montanus helveticus'' and ''habitat in Helvetia''</ref> It used castle battlements as well as cliff ledges for nesting before vanishing from Europe at least three centuries ago.<ref name=BWP/> It is also extinct over most of its former range, and now almost the entirety of the wild breeding population of just over 500 birds is in Morocco, at [[Souss-Massa National Park]], where there are three documented colonies, and near the mouth of the [[Oued Tamri]] (north of [[Agadir]]), where there is a single colony containing almost half the Moroccan breeding population. There is some movement of birds between these two sites.<ref name=iucn/>    

[[Image:Nbibis013.jpg|thumb|Part of a flock in the Souss Massa stronghold]]
Religious traditions helped this species to survive in one Turkish colony long after the species had disappeared from Europe, since it was believed that the ibis [[bird migration|migrated]] each year to guide [[Hajj]] pilgrims to [[Mecca]]. The ibis was protected by its religious significance, and a festival was held annually to celebrate its return north.<ref name = aewa6>{{cite web| author = Beintema, Nienke | title= Saving a charismatic bird | work= | url= http://www.unep-aewa.org/publications/saving_charismatic_bird.pdf |format = PDF| publisher=AEWA Secretariat  |accessdate=11 December 2008 }}</ref> The Turkish ibis population was centred near the small town of [[Birecik]] in the south east of the country, and during the first half of the twentieth century, the Birecik colony maintained a relatively stable population of about 500 breeding pairs, reaching an estimated total population of about 3,000 around 1930. By the 1970s, numbers had drastically declined and a captive breeding program was initiated in 1977 with one adult pair and nine chicks taken from the wild. This program largely failed to revert the decline; there were 400 birds in 1982, five pairs in 1986, and seven pairs in 1987. Only three birds returned from their wintering grounds in 1989, and just one in 1990. The returning birds died before they could reproduce, thus rendering the species extinct in the wild in Turkey as of 1992. Once the wild Turkish population became non-viable, the colony was maintained as a flock which was free-flying for most of the year but caged in autumn to prevent migration.<ref name =kelaynak/>

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the Northern Bald Ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East.<ref name= Schulz >{{cite journal| last= Schulz | first= Holger | coauthors = Schulz, Maria | month= April | year= 1992| title= New records of the Bald Ibis (''Geronticus eremita'') from Saudi Arabia | journal=Journal of Ornithology | volume= 133| issue=2 | pages=165<U+2013>172 | doi = 10.1007/BF01639909}}</ref> Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of [[Bedouin]] nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes.

The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round.<ref name=iucn/> In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the Northern Bald Ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the [[Azores]], and Cape Verde.<ref name=BWP/> 

Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.<ref name =rspb>{{cite web| title= Northern bald ibis in Syria | work= Satellite tracking | url= http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/science/international/tracking/northern_bald_ibis.asp | publisher = [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) |accessdate=14 November 2008 }}</ref><ref name = winter>{{cite web|title= Bald Ibis adults tracked to wintering ground | work= News 26-10-2006 | url= http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/10/bald_ibis.html| publisher = [[BirdLife International]]  |accessdate=14 November 2008 }}</ref>

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===
[[Image:Geronticus eremita Waldrapp.jpg|thumb|A young bird]]
The Northern Bald Ibis breeds in loosely spaced colonies, nesting on cliff ledges or amongst boulders on steep slopes, usually on the coast or near a river.<ref name= BWP/> Volunteer climbers have created extra ledge spaces in the [[Souss-Massa National Park|Souss-Massa]] colonies to ensure that breeding population is not limited by the availability of nest ledges,<ref name=rspb2/> and artificial [[nest box]]es are used in the managed colony at [[Birecik]].<ref name= Birecik>Topak, Muzaffer (Coordinator) [http://www.sisav.org.tr/www.sisav.org.tr-tur/AV-YABAN%20(ING).pdf Game and Wildlife in Turkey] (PDF) Republic of Turkey Ministry of Forestry General Directorate of National Parks and Game</ref> In the past, the birds also nested in buildings.<ref name= BWP/>

This ibis starts breeding at 3<U+2013>5 years of age,<ref name =bci/> and pairs for life.<ref name= BWP/> The male chooses a nest site, cleans it, and then advertises for a female by waving his crest and giving low rumbling calls.

=== Feeding ===
[[Image:Oued massa.JPG|thumb|left|The steppes around the Oued Massa are favoured feeding areas]]
This gregarious species [[Commuting|commutes]] in flocks from the cliff breeding sites or winter roosts to its feeding areas, flying in a '''V'''-formation.

The Northern Bald Ibis consumes a very wide variety of mainly animal food; [[faeces|faecal]] analysis of the Moroccan breeding population has shown that lizards and [[Darkling beetle|tenebrionid beetles]] predominate in the diet,<ref name =rspb2/> although small mammals, ground-nesting birds, and invertebrates such as snails, scorpions, spiders, and caterpillars are also taken.<ref name = aewa/> Males will sometimes "scrounge" food from females.<ref name= waza5>{{cite journal| last= Kotrschal | first = Kurt | year= 2007| title= The Gr<U+00FC>nau Project: establishing a semi-wild colony of Waldrapp Ibis  | journal= WAZA Magazine | volume= 5 | issue= | pages=12<U+2013>14 | url = http://www.waza.org/conservation/pfd%20magazine/Magazin%205/The%20Gruenau%20Project.pdf |format = PDF | doi = }}</ref> As the flock moves across the ground, the ibis uses its long bill to feel for food items in the loose, sandy soil.

Quantitative assessments of the importance of sites for breeding, roosting, and foraging have guided actions to prevent disturbance and the loss of key areas to mass tourism development. Wardening by members of the local community has reduced human intrusion and increased the perceived value of the birds. The provision of drinking water and the removal and deterrence of predators and competitors enhances breeding prospects, and monitoring has confirmed that [[steppe]] and two-year [[Crop rotation|fallows]] are key feeding habitats.<ref name= bci>{{cite journal| last=Bowden | first= Christopher G.

Maintaining such non-intensive land uses in the future may present major management challenges, and the recovery in the [[Souss-Massa National Park|Souss-Massa]] region remains precarious because the population is concentrated in just a few places. However, it could provide opportunities for natural extension of the range to formerly occupied sites further north in Morocco.<ref name= bci/> 
[[Image:Waldrapp Ibis is feeding a chick.jpg|thumb|upright|Adult feeding a chick]]

The main cause of breeding failure at the Souss-Massa National Park is the loss of eggs to predators,<ref name =iucn/> especially the [[Common Raven]] which nest monitoring has shown to have had a serious impact at one sub-colony.<ref name =rspb2/> The effects of predators on adult birds have not been studied, but the very similar Southern Bald Ibis, ''Geronticus calvus'', is hunted by large [[bird of prey|raptors]], particularly those that share its breeding cliffs.<ref name="  Harrison">Harrison (1997) p.104 "[http://sabap2.adu.org.za/docs/sabap1/092.pdf Bald Ibis]"</ref> There is evidence of chick starvation in some years, but the main threats to breeding birds are human disturbance and the loss of feeding habitat.<ref name =rspb2/> There was a dramatic mortality incident at the Moroccan colonies in May 1996, when 40 adults died or disappeared over a period of nine days. Although analyses have not identified the cause, an obscure virus, a toxin, or [[botulism]] are thought to be the most likely causes of the deaths.<ref name =rspb2/> Nevertheless, the population has continued increasing slowly.<ref name= ibiseremitablog>{{cite web|ibiseremita.blogspot.com | title= Reproducci<U+00F3>n del ibis eremita en 2010| url= http://ibiseremita.blogspot.com/2011/01/el-seguimiento-de-la-reproduccion.html}} Retrieved 13 April 2011</ref>

However, young birds do not winter nor return with the adults and their wintering grounds are still unknown.<ref name = winter/> Although the wild Syrian population is very small, the discovery that semi-wild Turkish birds on a migration trial visited the [[Palmyra]] colony has led to hopes that some migrants may join the Syrian breeding population and boost the numbers in that country.<ref name = dead/>

An intensive community-based protection program in [[Palmyra]] under an FAO/Italian Cooperation project during 2002&ndash;2004 recorded an average breeding performance that was higher than in Turkey and in Morocco.  During period 2005&ndash;2010 the protection program, now under Birdlife Middle East management had a much lower effort and lack of constant external scientific and technical assistance to local authorities. This resulted in a very variable breeding performance; two fatal and predictable breeding failures occurred in 2005 and 2008. During 2004&ndash;2007, due to prior high breeding performance, four subadults returned to the colony and three recruited successfully, compensating the natural mortality of adults. The unsustainably high mortality of young ibises outside the breeding grounds (an estimated 85%) and the breeding failures in 2009 and 2010 (due to unknown causes) meant that the colony reached its lowest size ever in 2010, only one pair, and three adults. Extinction at this point seems unavoidable.<ref name = serra>{{cite web| author = Serra, Gianluca| title= Conservation saga of N.

=== Turkey ===
With the loss of the genuinely wild Turkish population, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry's Directorate of Natural Preservation and National Parks established a new semi-wild colony at Birecik. This was heavily managed, with birds taken into captivity after the breeding season to prevent migration.<ref name=iucn/> The program was successful, with numbers at 91 as of July 2006. The intention is to allow the birds to migrate once the population reaches a stable 100 pairs, excluding young.<ref name =kelaynak>{{tr icon}} {{cite web| author = | title= <U+00C7>evre Ve Orman Bakanli<U+011F>i | work= The Birecik Bald Ibis Breeding and Repopulation Program | url=http://www.milliparklar.gov.tr/bolumler/avyaban/icerik/cakcan/kelaynak_dosyalar/frame.htm | publisher= Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry Directorate of Natural Preservation and National Parks |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622113314/http://www.milliparklar.gov.tr/bolumler/avyaban/icerik/cakcan/kelaynak_dosyalar/frame.htm |archivedate = June 22, 2008|deadurl=yes}} Retrieved 13 November 2008{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

The birds are released in late January or early February to breed outside the cages on ledges and, mainly, in the nest boxes in the breeding station compound. The ibises are free flying and forage around the Birecik area in forest nurseries, agricultural fields, and along the [[Euphrates]], but supplementary food is also provided. Following the end of the breeding season, the birds are taken into cages in late July or early August to prevent migration.<ref name =kelaynak/> A trial migration using tagged birds confirmed the risks presented to travelling birds by pesticides.<ref name = dead/>

=== Reintroductions ===

The guidelines for the conservation and reintroduction of the Northern Bald Ibis were established in 2003 at an International Advisory Group for Northern Bald Ibis (IAGNBI) conference in [[Innsbruck]] at the Alpenzoo, which maintains the European [[Breed registry|studbook]] for the Northern Bald Ibis.<ref name= eep/><ref name= IAGNBI2003d>Boehm ''et al.'' (2003) p.1 "Introduction"</ref>
[[Image:Waldrapp-Schoenbrunn01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tiergarten Sch<U+00F6>nbrunn]] in Vienna is running a successful breeding programme for reintroduction]]
Decisions taken at the meeting included:
* There should be no augmenting of the wild populations at [[Souss-Massa National Park|Souss-Massa]] or in [[Palmyra]] using zoo-bred ibises.<ref name= IAGNBI2003>Boehm ''et al.'' (2003) pp.10<U+2013>11 "Conservation Priorities"</ref>
* There are two distinctive populations of Northern Bald Ibis, and the separate ranges of the eastern and western forms should be respected.<ref name= IAGNBI2003/>
* In order to prepare birds for release, groups of chicks should be hand-reared by human "parents".<ref name= IAGNBI2003b>Boehm ''et al.'' (2003) pp.12<U+2013>19 "Group workshop to discuss and develop guidelines for Northern Bald Ibis (''Geronticus eremita'') release"</ref>
* Migration routes and stop-over points will have to be taught to young birds, since it is unlikely that they will discover this information by themselves.<ref name= IAGNBI2003b/>

A second conference in Spain in 2006 stressed the need to survey potential and former sites in northwest Africa and the Middle East for currently undetected colonies. The need to raise the standards of hygiene and husbandry in the [[Birecik]] aviaries was reiterated, and the prevalence of skin problems in a number of zoos reinforced the view that no zoo birds should be used for any free-flying trials.<ref name= IAGNBI2007>Boehm ''et al.''

[[Image:Graz Schlossberg Waldrapp Infotafel.jpg|thumb|The Austrian reintroduction]]
The Scharnstein Project is an attempt to establish a migratory Waldrapp colony by using [[Ultralight aviation|ultralight planes]] to teach a migration route. The scheme builds on the Gr<U+00FC>nau research by developing a method to control and guide the autumn migration of a founder population, which then can pass this migration tradition to subsequent generations. In May 2002, 11 birds from the Vienna Zoo and the Gr<U+00FC>nau colony were trained to follow two microlight planes, and in 2003, a first attempt was made to lead a group of birds from [[Scharnstein]] to southern Tuscany. Due to adverse weather and technical problems, the birds had to be transported by road over a considerable part of the distance.<ref name =waza/> The subsequent releases were more successful, with birds wintering in Tuscany, and, from 2005, returning to northern Austria. In 2008, a female ibis named Aurelia flew 930&nbsp;km (580&nbsp;mi) back to Austria for her fourth return to the breeding site. The hazards of the journey are shown by the loss of her two offspring and her mate while on the southern journey in the autumn of 2007.<ref name = Waldrapp>{{de icon}} {{cite web| author = | title= Handaufzucht und Migration 2008| work= Waldrapp-Burghausen | url=http://www.waldrapp-burghausen.de/waldrapp/ | publisher= }} Retrieved 26 November 2008</ref>

==== Northern Morocco ====
[[Image:Atlas-Mountains-Labeled-2 new.jpg|thumb|left|Location of the Rif mountains]]
There is a planned reintroduction of the ibis at Ain Tijja-[[Mezguitem]] in the north-east of Morocco. Since the wild populations further south remain vulnerable, and the porous sandstone of their breeding ledges is exposed to erosion, the intention is to establish a non-migratory population (stocked from German, Swiss, and Austrian zoos) in an area where this species was know to have bred up to about 1980. The station in the [[Rif]] mountains was built in 2000, and stocked with the first group of zoo-bred birds. A second importation of zoo-bred birds and the construction of an information centre took place in 2004. Six pairs bred in 2006 subsequent to a change in the birds' diet, and six offspring from five nests were successfully reared. In 2007 there were 19 birds (13 adults and six juveniles) in the aviary.<ref name = waza3>{{cite web| title= The plight of the western population of the Waldrapp ibis (''Geronticus eremita'')  | work= Conservation projects | url= http://www.waza.org/conservation/projects/projects.php?id=32 | publisher=WAZA  |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}</ref> 

The rock walls of the mountains have many potential breeding ledges, and an artificial lake provides water to the birds and to the local human population. Steppe pasture which is not exposed to herbicides or pesticides gives good foraging. Once the population reaches around 40 birds, a release will be initiated, subject to international agreement. The reintroduction site is 760&nbsp;km (475&nbsp;mi) from Agadir on the other side of the Atlas Mountains, so accidental contamination of the wild colonies is unlikely.<ref name= waza4>{{cite journal| last= M<U+00FC>ller | first=Hans Peter | coauthors= | month= | year= | title= The Re-introduction Project "Beshar el Kheir" at Ain Tijja-Mezguitem in North-east Morocco | journal= WAZA Magazine | volume= 5| issue= | pages=24<U+2013>26 | url = http://www.waza.org/conservation/pfd%20magazine/Magazin%205/Aintijja_Mezguitem.pdf |format = PDF | doi = }}</ref>
