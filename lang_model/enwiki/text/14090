[[Brighton and Hove]], a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] on the [[English Channel]] coast in southeast England, has a large and diverse stock of buildings "unrivalled architecturally" among the country's [[seaside resort]]s.<ref name="Antram3">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=3.}}</ref> The urban area, designated a city in 2000, is made up of the formerly separate towns of [[Brighton]] and [[Hove]], nearby villages such as [[Portslade]], [[Patcham]] and [[Rottingdean]], and 20th-century estates such as [[Moulsecoomb]] and [[Mile Oak]].  The conurbation was first united in 1997 as a [[unitary authority]] and has a population of about 253,000.  About half of the {{convert|20430|acre|ha|adj=on}} geographical area is classed as [[Urban area#United Kingdom|built up]].<ref name="CSPS7">{{cite web|title=Brighton & Hove City Council Local Development Framework Development Plan Document: Core Strategy Proposed Submission|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/ldf/REg_27Core_Strategy_Proposed_Submission_February_2010v2.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2013|date=February 2010|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|page=7|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MFeMYpJi|archivedate=30 December 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Brighton's transformation from medieval fishing village into spa town and pleasure resort, patronised by royalty and fashionable high society, coincided with the development of [[Regency architecture]] and the careers of three architects whose work came to characterise the {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} seafront.  The previously separate village of Hove developed as a comfortable middle-class residential area "under a heavy veneer of [Victorian] suburban respectability":<ref name="Fash17<U+2013>18">{{Harvnb|Dale|1967|pp=17<U+2013>18.}}</ref> large houses spread rapidly across the surrounding fields during the late 19th century, although the high-class and successful [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] was a product of the [[Regency era]].  Old villages such as Portslade, Rottingdean, [[Ovingdean]] and Patcham, with ancient churches, farms and small flint cottages, became suburbanised as the two towns grew and merged, and the creation of "Greater Brighton" in 1928 brought into the urban area swathes of open land which were then used for housing and industrial estates.  Many buildings were lost in the 1960s and 1970s, when Brighton's increasing regional importance encouraged redevelopment, but conservation movements were influential in saving other buildings.

Much of the city's built environment is composed of buildings of the Regency, [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] eras.<ref name="SPD09-3">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=3.}}</ref> The Regency style, typical of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, is characterised by pale [[stucco]]ed exteriors with [[Classical architecture|Classical-style]] [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] and [[bay window]]s.<ref name="Antram10<U+2013>12">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=10<U+2013>12.}}</ref><ref name="SPD09-25">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=25.}}</ref> Even the modest two-storey [[terraced house]]s which spread rapidly across the steeply sloping landscape in the mid-19th century display some elements of this style.  Extensive suburban development in Hove and the north of Brighton in the late 19th and early 20th century displays architectural features characteristic of those eras, with an emphasis on decorative brickwork and [[gable]]s.  Postwar developments range from Brutalist commercial and civic structures to pastiches of earlier styles.  [[Green building|Sustainable building techniques]] have become popular for individual houses and on a larger scale, such as at the long-planned [[New England Quarter]] [[Brownfield land|brownfield development]].

Local and national government have recognised the city's architectural heritage through the designation of [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]] and [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]] status to many developments.  Since 1969, 34 conservation areas have been created, covering areas of various sizes and eras; and more than 1,200 structures have listed status based on their "special architectural or historic interest".

==Historical context==
{{main|History of Brighton}}

===Early buildings===
[[File:43 Meeting House Lane, Brighton (NHLE Code 1381786).jpg|thumb|right|Buildings in [[The Lanes]] are small and tightly crowded.  This [[Clapboard (architecture)|weatherboarded]] and [[Jettying|jettied]] example (43 Meeting House Lane) is one of the oldest.]]
Brighton was originally an agricultural and fishing village surrounded by fields where sheep were farmed and corn was grown.  In the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] era, small buildings developed in an area bounded by four streets named after the points of the compass, and a church stood on higher ground inland.  Modest cottages for the fishermen stood on the beach below the cliffs and the now vanished South Street.<ref name="ASoN13">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=13.}}</ref><ref name="BerryHG15">Berry, Sue (1988): ''Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography'', in {{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=15.}}</ref> A thriving fishing industry contributed to the town's first period of growth in the 16th and 17th centuries,<ref name="BerryHG15"/> but development did not expand beyond the old boundaries.<ref name="EncB189">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=<U+00A7>189.}}</ref> The industry then contracted in the early 18th century, and depopulation occurred.  Labour and land for redevelopment accordingly became cheaper, and because good travel and communication routes were already established the town was well placed to grow rapidly again when sea-bathing became fashionable in the mid-18th century.<ref name="BerryHG15"/> Little pre-18th century architecture remains in Brighton,<ref name="VCH56961"/> therefore<U+2014>although there are some individual buildings.  For example, 27 King Street in the [[North Laine]] is cobble-fronted and retains a [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] interior which could be 17th-century.<ref name="NHLE-1380387">{{NHLE|desc=27, King Street, Brighton|num=1380387|grade=II|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref> Hove, meanwhile, was a single-street village with a [[manor house]] and some modest cottages.  Although Hove Street survives, the manor house was demolished in 1936 and no other original buildings remain.<ref name="Antram193<U+2013>194">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=193<U+2013>194.}}</ref>

Early-18th-century descriptions of the old town (the present [[The Lanes|Lanes]]) concentrated on how small and low the houses were, and how the lower storeys were characteristically set slightly below ground level.  This, and the proximity of the houses to each other, may have offered protection against storms and flooding from the sea.<ref name="VCH56961"/><ref name="Robinson33<U+2013>34">{{Harvnb|Robinson|1966|pp=33<U+2013>34.}}</ref> (In one of the earliest descriptions of Brighton<U+2014>a letter dated 1736<U+2014>the rector of [[Buxted]] claims that "... we live here underground almost ... the second storey is finished something under 12 feet.")<ref name="Bizarre48">{{Harvnb|Horlock|2010|p=48.}}</ref>  "Huddling together" may have also helped the houses survive to the present day: they were poorly built and had little structural integrity.  Typical Lanes buildings are [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] and plastered with load-bearing walls of [[bungaroosh]] with some flint.<ref name="VCH56961"/><ref name="Robinson33<U+2013>34"/> Brick [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] and [[Course (architecture)|courses]] added strength, and fa<U+00E7>ades were often studded with pebbles from the beach.  These would sometimes be coated with tar to keep water out,<ref name="VCH56961"/> although this only became common in the early 19th century.  In The Lanes, such buildings can be seen at Bartholomews, Middle Street and Ship Street among others.<ref name="NEB11">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=11.}}</ref>

Buildings of the 16th and 17th centuries and earlier can be found in the old villages absorbed by modern Brighton and Hove.  At [[St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean]], the 12th-century [[nave]] and [[chancel]] replaced a [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] structure.<ref name="Dale205">{{Harvnb|Dale|1989|p=205.}}</ref><ref name="Whiteman116">{{Harvnb|Whiteman|Whiteman|1998|p=116.}}</ref> [[St Helen's Church, Hangleton|St Helen's Church]] at Hangleton retains 11th-century [[Opus spicatum|herringbone masonry]] and other ancient fabric.<ref name="NewPevsner271">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=271.}}</ref> The old parish churches of [[All Saints Church, Patcham|Patcham]], [[St Nicolas Church, Portslade|Portslade]], [[St Peter's Church, Preston Village, Brighton|Preston]], [[St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean|Rottingdean]] and [[St Nicholas' Church, Brighton|Brighton]] itself all retain some features from the 12th to 14th centuries, although they were all subject to [[Victorian restoration]].<ref name="NewPevsner-OldChurches">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|pp=164, 274, 277, 280<U+2013>281, 598.}}</ref> Hove's oldest secular building is [[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] (now a pub), a Vernacular-style flint building with some 15th-century fabric.

===Georgian and Regency periods===
[[File:Parapet and Cornice at 102 Marine Parade, Brighton.JPG|thumb|right|102 Marine Parade has such [[Regency architecture|Regency-style]] features as a bow-fronted stuccoed fa<U+00E7>ade, [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s, decorative [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and a [[parapet]].]]
The first development outside the four-street boundary of the ancient village was in 1771<U+2013>72, when North Row (soon renamed Marlborough Place) was built on the west side of the open land.<ref name="EncB189"/><ref name="Antram86">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=86.}}</ref> Some tarred cobble-fronted buildings survive there.<ref name="NEB11"/> At the same time, inns were becoming established as fashionable venues: the Castle (demolished) and the Old Ship both had "uncommonly large and expensive" [[assembly rooms]] for dancing and high-class socialising.  The Castle's assembly rooms of 1754 were redesigned by [[John Crunden]] in 1776 in [[Classical architecture|Classical style]];{{refn|group=Note|The interior survives in altered form at the former [[St Stephen's Church, Brighton|St Stephen's Church]] in the [[Montpelier, Brighton|Montpelier]] district, having been moved there in 1850<U+2013>51.<ref name="Antram171">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=171.}}</ref>}} in 1761 [[Robert Golden]] designed [[Palladian architecture|Palladian-style]] rooms for the Old Ship, later redecorated in a "[[Robert Adam#Architectural style|[Robert] Adamish]]" style after Crunden's work at the Castle.<ref name="Antram8+97">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=8, 97.}}</ref><ref name="NewPevsner48">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=48.}}</ref> Robert Adam himself redesigned [[Marlborough House, Brighton|Marlborough House]] in 1786<U+2013>87: with its elegant [[Palladian architecture#Neo-Palladian|Neo-Palladian]] fa<U+00E7>ade and "spatially arresting interior",<ref name="NewPevsner49"/> it has been called the finest house of its era in the city.<ref name="Antram84">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=84.}}</ref>

The Prince Regent visited Brighton regularly from 1783 and soon wanted a house.<ref name="NewPevsner48"/> A building near the Castle Inn was found, and [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] extended it in "a stilted Classical style" in 1786<U+2013>87.  The Royal Marine Pavilion, as it was called, became increasingly important in the growing town as it became the centre of activities for the Prince and his entourage<U+2014>and the focal point for his regularly changing architectural tastes.  Holland revamped the building in 1801<U+2013>04 in a Chinese style, and the French-inspired interior was changed as well.  Meanwhile, [[William Porden]] added a "monumental" complex of stables (now the [[Brighton Dome]] complex) to the west in 1804<U+2013>08, in an [[Architecture of India|Indian style]].  [[James Wyatt]] and later [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] were then commissioned to alter the building again; Nash's work, finished in 1823, gave the building its present opulent [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic Revival]]/[[Orientalism#Orientalizing styles in Europe|Orientalist]] appearance.<ref name="NewPevsner49">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=49.}}</ref><ref name="NewPevsner176<U+2013>185">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|pp=176<U+2013>185.}}</ref>

[[File:Royal Crescent, Brighton (IoE Code 481162).JPG|thumb|left|[[Royal Crescent, Brighton|Royal Crescent]] was the first of many 19th-century [[Crescent (architecture)|crescents]].]]
The Prince Regent's patronage helped Brighton become a fashionable, high-class resort.<ref name="BoB12">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic. School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|p=12.}}</ref> As it became more popular, it further outgrew its four-street boundaries.  Planned development, as opposed to ad hoc growth, started in the 1780s with North Parade and South Parade alongside [[Old Steine]].  By the 1790s it spread well to the east along the East Cliff: New Steine (1790<U+2013>95, but refaced in the 1820s) was the first sea-facing square, then came Bedford, Clarence and Russell Squares (all early 19th century) and Brighton's first [[Crescent (architecture)|crescent]], [[Royal Crescent, Brighton|Royal Crescent]] (1799<U+2013>1802).<ref name="Antram9<U+2013>10">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=9<U+2013>10.}}</ref> Powered by "fashion, demand and the availability of capital",<ref name="BoB12"/> the scale of building and architectural ambition kept growing<U+2014>especially when the father-and-son architects [[Amon Wilds|Amon]] and [[Amon Henry Wilds]] and their associate [[Charles Busby]] arrived in the town.  They helped to develop the [[Regency architecture|Regency style]] which now characterises the seafront.  [[Hanover Crescent, Brighton|Hanover Crescent]], [[Montpelier Crescent]], [[Park Crescent, Brighton|Park Crescent]], the [[Kemp Town]] estate (Sussex Square, Lewes Crescent, Arundel Terrace and Chichester Terrace) and [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick Town]] (Brunswick Terrace, Brunswick Square and associated streets) were among their set-piece developments.<ref name="BoB12<U+2013>18">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic. School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|pp=12<U+2013>18.}}</ref><ref name="Antram10<U+2013>13">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=10<U+2013>13.}}</ref> (The Brunswick estate was also the first significant development in the parish of Hove.)<ref name="Antram194"/> Accordingly, by the early 19th century, Brighton was renowned for the splendour and "strongly individual character" of its architecture.<ref name="Crisis4">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1990|p=4.}}</ref> [[William Cobbett]] claimed in 1832 that it "certainly surpass[ed] in beauty all other towns in the world".<ref name="Crisis3">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1990|p=3.}}</ref> Due to the quantity and quality of work produced by the Wilds<U+2013>Wilds<U+2013>Busby partnership and the groundbreaking designs produced by Holland, Nash and Porden<U+2014>which "established a vocabulary of architectural elements" that defined the entire Regency style<U+2014>Brighton's early urban development was characterised by an "overflowing of architectural inventiveness".<ref name="BoB6">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic. School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|p=6.}}</ref>

Around the same time, though, the first concerns were raised about the poor quality of houses on the edge of Brighton<U+2014>especially on St James's Street, Edward Street and the roads running off West and North Streets.  Many reports and studies were made by the Corporation and outsiders over the next decades, but little action was taken.<ref name="BerryHG16">Berry, Sue (1988): ''Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography'', in {{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=16.}}</ref> There was, however, some [[Urban renewal|slum clearance]] in 1845, when Queens Road was driven through the infamous Petty France and Durham districts to provide a direct link from [[Brighton railway station|the station]] to the town centre.<ref name="NEB262">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=262.}}</ref>

===Railway age and Victorian era===
[[File:View Northeastwards from Howard Place, Brighton (December 2013).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Vast swathes of housing covered the land north and east of Brighton after the railway was built.  [[London Road viaduct]] ''(pictured at the bottom)'' originally stood in open fields.]]
The [[Brighton Main Line|London<U+2013>Brighton]] railway reached the coast in 1841, and westward and eastward links were soon built from [[Brighton railway station]].  This was built in 1841 to [[David Mocatta]]'s [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] design, then added to in 1882<U+2013>83 when H.E. Wallis added the dramatically curved [[train shed]] and [[Frederick Banister|F.D. Banister]] made further alterations, creating a building "entirely characteristic of the greater Victorian railway station".<ref name="Antram61<U+2013>63">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=61<U+2013>63.}}</ref> The line to the east crossed the landmark [[London Road viaduct]], a 28-arch, {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on}}, sharply curving brick structure which stood in empty fields when built by [[John Urpeth Rastrick]] in 1846.<ref name="Antram183">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=183.}}</ref>

Development had not yet reached this part of Brighton because the ancient field system to the north and east of the town constrained its growth,<ref name="BerryHG15">Berry, Sue (1988): ''Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography'', in {{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=15.}}</ref> as did the ownership by the Stanford family of most of the remaining land surrounding Brighton and Hove.  They carefully controlled its sale and development, releasing parcels of land gradually and ensuring that visually cohesive planned estates of high-quality housing were built.<ref name="BerryHG16"/> The area's 19th- and early 20th-century housing accordingly has a clear pattern and "a distinctive character".  The poorest housing was to the east of Brighton (slum clearance around [[Carlton Hill, Brighton|Carlton Hill]], Albion Hill and Edward Street has replaced much of this); working-class housing for tradesmen, railway workers and other [[artisan]]s spread to the northeast around Lewes Road, the viaduct and the station; middle-class developments lay north of the centre around London Road; and the highest-quality suburbs developed to the northwest of Brighton and north of Hove on the Stanford family's land.<ref name="BerryHG16<U+2013>17">Berry, Sue (1988): ''Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography'', in {{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|pp=16<U+2013>17.}}</ref><ref name="Antram179">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=179.}}</ref> As originally built, the inner suburbs were of variable architectural quality: small houses with very late Regency-style flourishes predominated, but scattered among these were small-scale industrial and commercial development (the latter especially along the main roads), a range of high-quality Victorian churches such as [[St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton|St Bartholomew's]], [[St Martin's Church, Brighton|St Martin's]] and [[St Joseph's Church, Brighton|St Joseph's]], and institutional buildings such as workhouses, hospitals and schools.<ref name="Antram179<U+2013>187">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=179<U+2013>187.}}</ref> Improving access to education was a particular priority for Brighton Corporation in the 19th century, so straight after the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] was passed it set up a [[School boards in England and Wales|school board]], appointed Thomas Simpson as its architect and surveyor and provided several schools in suburban areas<U+2014>most of which survive with little alteration.  Simpson also worked for the Hove school board from 1876, the enlarged Brighton and Preston board from 1878 and took on his son Gilbert to assist in 1890.<ref name="NewPevsner196">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=196.}}</ref>

[[File:Hilton Brighton Metropole Hotel, Kings Road, Brighton (From Beach) (April 2013).JPG|thumb|left|[[Alfred Waterhouse]] designed the [[Hilton Brighton Metropole|Metropole Hotel]] in 1890.]]
The coming of the railway changed Brighton from an exclusive resort to a town popular with all classes of holidaymaker and permanent resident alike: the population grew by nearly 50% in the first decade.<ref name="Antram15">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=15.}}</ref> The seafront remained the main attraction, so an array of features were added: pleasure piers, promenades, hotels, entertainment kiosks and an aquarium.  The [[West Pier]] and [[Brighton Pier|Palace Pier]] date from 1863 and 1891 respectively, although both were completed several years later; Madeira Drive was laid out in 1872 and received its "signature cast-iron terrace" (including a pagoda-shaped lift decorated with Greek gods) in the 1890s; Kings Road was widened in the 1880s; and large hotels began to line it even before this.  Early-19th-century hotels such as the [[Royal Albion Hotel|Royal Albion]], [[Royal York Hotel|Royal York]] and [[Bedford Hotel (Brighton)|Bedford]] were joined by an Italianate pair by [[John Whichcord Jr.]] (the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand]], 1864) and [[Horatio Nelson Goulty]] (the [[Norfolk Hotel, Brighton|Norfolk]], 1865).  Then in 1890 the vast [[Hilton Brighton Metropole|Metropole Hotel]] by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] "broke the orthodoxy of stucco along the seafront" due to its prominent red-brick and [[terracotta]] fa<U+00E7>ade.<ref name="Antram20">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=20.}}</ref> Its deliberately different design caused shock and brought criticism, but the ''British Architect'' journal considered it "a wonderful relief" from the homogeneity of stuccoed Regency buildings.<ref name="Antram103">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=103.}}</ref> Brighton's architecture was beginning to reflect trends in the country as a whole, but the Regency style and the Royal Pavilion's [[Onion dome|onion-domed]], [[minaret]]-studded opulence continued to influence architecture throughout the town, and on the seafront in particular.<ref name="Antram22">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=22.}}</ref>

Hove, meanwhile, was also developing rapidly<U+2014>but its influences were different.  Although the Brunswick estate was successful, development of the neighbouring [[Adelaide Crescent]] stalled for more than 20 years and [[Decimus Burton]]'s original design was scaled back.  Next came [[Palmeira Square]] ({{circa}} 1855<U+2013>1865), where the evolution from Regency to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] Italianate is clear,<ref name="Antram118<U+2013>120">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=118<U+2013>120.}}</ref> and there was some suburban development (called Cliftonville) around the new [[Hove railway station]] in the 1860s, but large tracts of land to the north and west remained undeveloped because of conditions in William Stanford's will.  Only in 1872 did these conditions expire, and over the next 30 years Hove developed into a comfortable, spacious, suburban town with "a certain gentility" which it still possesses. Architects [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]] and [[Henry Jones Lanchester]] were involved at first, and [[William Willett]] built the streets of ornately decorated [[gault]] brick villas they designed.  Next came H.B. Measures and Amos Faulkner, who introduced more architectural variety and preferred red brick; then local architects [[Thomas Lainson]] and [[Clayton & Black]] laid out further estates of spacious tree-lined avenues and large half-timbered houses in the [[Queen Anne style architecture#British 19th-century Queen Anne style|Queen Anne Revival-style]] and Domestic Revival styles.<ref name="Antram194<U+2013>195">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=194<U+2013>195.}}</ref> Public buildings were also provided, such as Hove Town Hall (1882; demolished 1966), a public library (1907<U+2013>08) and [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] (a converted villa of 1877 designed in "drab Italianate" style by Thomas Lainson).<ref name="Antram196<U+2013>197">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=196<U+2013>197.}}</ref> Good Gothic Revival churches include Central United Reformed Church (1867 by Horatio Nelson Goulty), the "dignified and grand" [[Church of the Sacred Heart, Hove|Sacred Heart]] (1880<U+2013>81 by John Crawley) and [[Holy Trinity Church, Hove|Holy Trinity]] (1863 by James Woodman).<ref name="Antram196+200">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=196, 200.}}</ref>

===Early 20th century===

Residential growth continued in the interwar and postwar periods, and the distinctive zonal pattern of development continued.  Estates of [[Council house|council housing]] were built east and northeast of Brighton (at [[Whitehawk]], [[Bevendean]] and [[Moulsecoomb]], and in the redeveloped [[Carlton Hill, Brighton|Carlton Hill]] inner suburb which had been subject to [[urban renewal]]); middle-class residential housing developed to the north in the [[Patcham]] and [[Preston Village, Brighton|Preston]] areas; and suburbs such as [[Westdene]], [[Withdean]], Tongdean and [[West Blatchington]] to the northwest of Brighton and the north of Hove had an upper middle-class character.<ref name="BerryHG17">Berry, Sue (1988): ''Brighton and Hove: Historical Geography'', in {{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=17.}}</ref> The rapid interwar suburban growth was similar to that seen throughout southeast England, but it was particularly stimulated by the introduction of electric trains<ref name="BerryHG17"/> on the [[Brighton Main Line|main railway route to London]]<U+2014>bringing a quicker and much more frequent service and increasing the attractiveness of commuting.<ref name="Argus-10389544">{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/nostalgia/past_present/10385944.Art_Deco_treasures/|title=Art Deco treasures|last=Trimingham|first=Adam|date=6 May 2013|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ljp9N9Ym|archivedate=9 December 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> Meanwhile, Brighton Corporation began major slum clearance operations in the 1930s when the government offered financial incentives.<ref name="NEB153<U+2013>154">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=153<U+2013>154.}}</ref> [[Moulsecoomb]] and the Pankhurst Avenue area near [[Queen's Park, Brighton|Queen's Park]], both started in the early 1920s, were the first council estates.<ref name="NEB153"/> In the former, the South Moulsecoomb area was laid out first; its 478 houses, on {{convert|94|acre|ha}} taken from the parish of [[Patcham]] in 1920, were designed along "[[Garden city movement|garden city]]" lines with [[semi-detached]] houses set in large green spaces.<ref name="NEB205<U+2013>206">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=205<U+2013>206.}}</ref> North Moulsecoomb's 390 houses, including many brick-built terraces at a much higher density, followed from 1926.<ref name="NEB206">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=206.}}</ref> Brighton's first council flats were the four-storey Milner (1934) and Kingswood (1938) blocks, built as part of the [[Carlton Hill, Brighton|Carlton Hill]] slum clearance programme.<ref name="NEB4<U+2013>7">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=4, 7.}}</ref>

Several streets in central Brighton were also transformed by the Corporation in the 1920s and 1930s: they sought to improve the flow of traffic by widening main roads in the commercial heart of the town.

==Architectural characteristics==
[[File:Patcham Place, Old London Road, Patcham (IoE Code 482049).jpg|thumb|right|Black glazed [[mathematical tile]]s, as at [[Patcham Place]], are a distinctive local feature.]]
Since the present urban area's settlements first developed as fishing villages and [[South Downs|downland]] hamlets, the local architecture has been influenced by characteristic styles and the use of materials rarely seen elsewhere.  Black glazed [[mathematical tile]]s and [[bungaroosh]] are unique to Brighton and its immediate surroundings,<ref name="Antram6">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=6.}}</ref> and tarred cobblestones with brick [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]], salt-glazed brickwork and knapped or plain flints were also common in early buildings.<ref name="Crisis5"/> [[Stucco]]<U+2014>perfectly suited to seaside conditions<U+2014>predominated throughout the 19th century, such that "of nowhere else did it become so universally characteristic."<ref name="Crisis5"/> [[Bay window]]s, a common feature of seaside resorts, were treated distinctively; balconies, sometimes roofed, were included on most 19th-century houses;<ref name="Crisis5"/> Victorian and Edwardian houses were often designed as villas, with elaborate porches and decorative gables;<ref name="Antram18">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=18.}}</ref> and [[Terraced house|terraced housing]] is prevalent.  The Regency style was so popular and influential that it persisted much longer than in other places,<ref name="Antram17">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=17.}}</ref> while [[Gothic Revival architecture]] is almost absent in secular buildings<U+2014>although the style was popular for 19th-century churches, of which the city has a large, high-quality range.<ref name="Antram15">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=15.}}</ref>

===Building materials===
Bungaroosh, a low-quality composite material, was commonly used in construction in the 18th century.  The material contained miscellaneous objects such as broken bricks, lumps of wood, pebbles and stone; this mixture was then [[Formwork|shuttered]] in [[hydraulic lime]] until it hardened.  Bungaroosh walls were often hidden behind stucco or mathematical tile fa<U+00E7>ades, and are susceptible to water penetration.<ref name="Context29">{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Rob|date=March 1991|title=Bungaroosh (Bungarouche, Bunglarouge?)|journal=Context|publisher=Institute of Historic Building Conservation (IHBC)|location=Tunbridge Wells|issue=29|page=p. 7|url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/29/bungaroosh_dir/bungaroosh_s.htm|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEPEbtMM|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Antram7">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=7.}}</ref> Mathematical tiles, a similarly localised material, were designed to be laid overlapping each other, giving the appearance of brickwork.<ref name="SPD09-21">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=21.}}</ref> Glazed black tiles are closely associated with Brighton,<ref name="Antram6"/> and survive on 18th- and early 19th-century buildings such as [[Royal Crescent, Brighton|Royal Crescent]], [[Patcham Place]] and [[9 Pool Valley, Brighton|the shop at 9 Pool Valley]].<ref name="BoB111">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic.

It was used prominently on long, continuous terraces of houses, such as in the Brunswick and Kemp Town estates.  [[Rustication (architecture)|Rustication]] was sometimes used, especially at ground-floor level.<ref name="SPD09-25"/> Typical decorative mouldings include standard features of Classical architecture such as columns of various [[Classical order|orders]], [[pilaster]]s, [[parapet]]s, [[cornice]]s and capitals.<ref name="SPD09-26">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=26.}}</ref> Stucco fa<U+00E7>ades were not always well-regarded: writing in 1940, [[Louis Francis Salzman]] considered that stucco "hides what architectural features [the buildings] may possess and produces dull uniformity, entirely lacking in character".<ref name="VCH56961">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56961|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 <U+2013> The Rape of Lewes.

[[File:11 Grand Avenue, Hove (IoE Code 365533).jpg|thumb|left|Brick was often used for 19th-century houses, for both walls and chimney-stacks ''(11 Grand Avenue, Hove pictured)''.]]
Brick buildings are common throughout the area.  Pale [[Gault|gault brick]] is characteristic of some mid-19th-century residential developments, such as the area around Grand Avenue in Hove and the Valley Gardens area of Brighton (both [[List of conservation areas in Brighton and Hove|conservation areas]]).  Later in that century, smooth red brickwork became more common.  Yellowish [[London stock brick|stock bricks]] were popular in the 19th century for non-residential buildings and walls which were not readily visible.  Different coloured bricks, such as brown and grey-blue, were often used in [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] and dressings on walls made of flint or red bricks.<ref name="SPD09-18">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=18.}}</ref> The layout of brickwork "has a significant effect on a building's appearance"; the Flemish bond pattern is encountered most frequently in the city.<ref name="SPD09-19">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=19.}}</ref> On Victorian and Edwardian houses, brick chimney-stacks often served a decorative as well as a functional purpose, and were sometimes tall and ornate:<ref name="SPD09-11">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=11.}}</ref> examples include the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne-style]] houses at 8<U+2013>11 Grand Avenue, Hove (1900<U+2013>03, by Amos Faulkner).<ref name="TA">{{cite web|title=The Avenues Conservation Area Character Statement|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/conservation/Character_Area_The_Avenues_final.pdf|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council (Design & Conservation Department)|year=2005|format=PDF|accessdate=19 February 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EYSw7jhL|archivedate=19 February 2013|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="Antram202">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=202.}}</ref>

[[File:National Westminster Bank, Western Road, Brighton (IoE Code 481445).jpg|thumb|right|Some banks, such as T.B. Whinney's NatWest branch of 1905, are stone-built.]]
Stone was rarely used as a building material, as it was not prevalent locally.  Some churches and banks of the 19th and early 20th centuries were built of [[Bath stone|Bath]] or [[Portland stone|Portland]] stone, and [[Rag-stone|Kentish ragstone]] was used for [[St Joseph's Church, Brighton|St Joseph's Church]] on Elm Grove, but few ordinary residential or commercial buildings have any stonework.  [[Artificial stone]] was sometimes used for exterior features such as [[cornice]]s and columns, though, especially during the Victorian era.<ref name="SPD09-24">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=24.}}</ref> [[Flint]] is commonly found on the South Downs and became popular as a building material in the early 19th century.  Several styles of flintwork can be seen: rounded pebbles in seafront buildings, whole flints in rural cottages and agricultural buildings, [[Knapping|knapped (split) flints]], and random flintwork with brick dressings.<ref name="SPD09-22">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=22.}}</ref> The use of stone or brick quoins and dressings on flint walls, necessary for structural reasons, enhances the appearance of such buildings, "sometimes to great decorative effect".<ref name="SPD09-23">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=23.}}</ref> Knapped flint was used particularly in farmhouses in nearby villages which later became part of the urban area: Court House and Down House in Rottingdean, Home Farmhouse in [[Withdean]], Southdown House in Patcham and several houses in [[Ovingdean]] and [[Stanmer]] have them.<ref name="NEB11"/> The [[Sussex dialect]] includes specialist words for types of flint: the irregular joints between randomly laid knapped flints are "snail-creeps", and rounded pebbles are "pitchers".<ref name="NEB11"/>  An old "Brighton Vernacular" style has been identified: small cottages with cobblestone walls laid in [[Course (architecture)|courses]], whose windows and doors were edged with red brickwork.  Many examples of this style were demolished during the mid 20th-century slum clearance programmes.<ref name="SxHistv27p29">{{Harvnb|Hollingdale ed.|1989|p=29.}}</ref>

[[Clapboard (architecture)|Weatherboarding]] is uncommon, but there are several examples at Stanmer and Patcham (barns and cottages) and in Meeting House Lane in The Lanes.<ref name="NEB11"/> Nearby, 37a Duke Street<U+2014>the oldest building on that road<U+2014>is a "remarkable" late 18th-century house with a fa<U+00E7>ade of painted wooden blocks imitating stonework.<ref name="NEB11"/><ref name="Antram77">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=77.}}</ref> [[Timber framing]] is also rare in the city, but modern [[self-build]] schemes at Sea Saw Way, [[Whitehawk]] (1993) and Hogs Edge, [[Bevendean]] (1997<U+2013>2000) feature this structural system.  The latter development was built according to [[Walter Segal]]'s self-build methods and has sustainable features including recycled paper insulation.<ref name="NEB156">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=156.}}</ref>

These are usually steep and triangular: curved and shaped gables are uncommon in the area.  Stucco, plaster, [[Clapboard (architecture)|weatherboarding]] and woodwork were often used to decorate the face of the gable.<ref name="SPD09-15">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=15.}}</ref>

[[File:Decorative Gable at the former Belgrave Hotel, bottom of West Street, Brighton.JPG|thumb|left|This gable at the former Belgrave Hotel on Brighton seafront has ornate mouldings.]]
[[Bow window|Bow]] or [[bay window]]s were the "chief architectural feature" of Brighton's early houses.<ref name="VCH56961"/> Vertical sliding timber-framed [[sash window]]s with [[Muntin|glazing bars]] were usually inserted into these, although [[Casement window|casements]] were sometimes used<U+2014>typically on the oldest or most modest buildings.  Casements would sometimes be given glazing bars as well.  Such bars were usually slim and had [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] in various patterns.  The combination of partly recessed sashes and bow windows is characteristic of Brighton's Regency-era residential developments.<ref name="SPD09-28<U+2013>29">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|pp=28<U+2013>29.}}</ref> The [[Queen Anne style architecture#British 19th-century Queen Anne style|Queen Anne Revival-style]] housing popular in Hove in the late 19th century<ref name="Antram194<U+2013>195">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=194<U+2013>195.}}</ref> had its own window pattern: two-part sashes with many panes on the upper section, separated by wider glazing bars than those used in earlier years.<ref name="SPD09-28">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=28.}}</ref> Casement windows were popular on interwar [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] houses,<ref name="SPD09-29">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=29.}}</ref> as at Woodland Drive (a conservation area) in [[West Blatchington]];<ref name="WD">{{cite web|title=Woodland Drive Conservation Area Character Statement|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/conservation/Character_Area_Woodland_Drive_final.pdf|accessdate=31 July 2013|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council (Design & Conservation Department)|date=February 2005|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IX1B8DRM|archivedate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> and steel-framed [[Crittall Windows|Crittall]] windows are found in interwar Modernist buildings such as [[Embassy Court]]<ref name="SPD09-29"/> and the [[Moderne architecture|Moderne-style]] mansion flats at 4 Grand Avenue, Hove.<ref name="Antram202"/>

Elaborate [[Chambranle|doorcases]] and [[portico]]s with [[Classical architecture|Classical-style details]] are seen on many 19th-century houses, especially those built in the [[Regency era]].  A typical form consisted of two columns with decorative [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], an [[entablature]] and a straight roof, all stuccoed, supporting a [[Cast iron|cast-iron]] balcony.<ref name="SPD09-16<U+2013>17">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|pp=16<U+2013>17.}}</ref> Suburban villas often feature brick and timber porches with gabled tiled roofs.<ref name="SPD09-16">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=16.}}</ref> In central areas, many old houses have been converted into shops and have lost their original doorways in favour of glazed shopfronts.<ref name="VCH56961"/>

Balconies and canopied [[veranda]]s are often seen on larger Regency- and Victorian-era houses in central Brighton and Hove.  Typically at first-floor level, made of [[Portland stone]] or lead-coated timber and surrounded by cast iron railings with elaborate patterns, they sometimes span entire terraces of houses.  They were provided to extend the living space of the drawing room, considered the most important room in the house for socialising during that era; accordingly they extended some way beyond the ground floor.  Many terraces and squares faced central gardens or the sea, so balconies would give uninterrupted views of these.<ref name="SPD09-38<U+2013>39">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|pp=38<U+2013>39.}}</ref> Queen Anne Revival and Arts and Crafts-style villas of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in Hove and around [[Preston Park, Brighton|Preston Park]], featured wooden balconies with simple [[Baluster|balustrades]] formed of upright timbers.<ref name="SPD09-39">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=39.}}</ref>

[[File:Ammonite Capital at Montpelier Crescent, Brighton.jpg|thumb|right|Ammonite capitals were often used by [[Amon Henry Wilds]].]]
[[Molding (decorative)|Mouldings]] of various types were common external decorative features in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially on Regency-style buildings.  Many structural elements would typically feature moulded stucco work<U+2014>[[pilaster]]s, [[entablature]]s, [[pediment]]s, [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] and [[Course (architecture)|courses]]<U+2014>while other mouldings would be merely decorative.  Typical designs included shells, foliage (especially on [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]) and [[Rustication (architecture)#Variations|vermiculation]].  The [[Ammonite Order]] is a [[Classical order]] found almost exclusively in Brighton and Hove, consisting of [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] columns topped by capitals whose [[volute]]s are shaped like [[Ammonoidea|ammonite]] fossils.  Architect [[Amon Henry Wilds]] used them extensively.  Pilasters and columns of the [[Corinthian order]] are also common.  Victorian and Edwardian buildings made use of intricately moulded courses and bracketed [[eaves]].<ref name="SPD09-26"/> Elaborate carved [[relief]]s are found on some of [[John Leopold Denman]]'s buildings of the 1930s as a result of his collaboration with sculptor [[Joseph Cribb]].  In central Brighton, [[20<U+2013>22 Marlborough Place, Brighton|20<U+2013>22 Marlborough Place]] has a series of reliefs showing workers in the building trade,<ref name="Antram87">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=87.}}</ref> and 2<U+2013>3 Pavilion Buildings{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} have [[Portland stone]] capitals with scallops and [[seahorse]]s.<ref name="BoB33">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic. School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|p=33.}}</ref>

[[Terracotta]] was popular in the Victorian and Edwardian eras as an external decorative element, as was yellowish [[faience]] earthenware.  They were commonly used to top off a structure such as a wall or roof, in the form of [[finial]]s, urns and caps.  Carved terracotta panels were also used to decorate fa<U+00E7>ades, especially below windows:<ref name="SPD09-20">{{Harvnb|Brighton & Hove City Council|2009|p=20.}}</ref> the former Hove Hospital{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} (now Tennyson Court) has prominent examples of this.<ref name="EncH&Pv7p118<U+2013>119">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 7, pp. 118<U+2013>119.}}</ref>

Basements are a very common feature of houses in Hove: it was customary for servants to live in them in the Victorian and Edwardian era.  According to a Hove Council survey in 1954, 2,573 houses were built with basements.<ref name="EncH&Pv2p15">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 2, p. 15.}}</ref>

===Residential architecture===
Brighton's earliest [[council house]]s date from the 19th century.  Two landowners donated land around the present St Helen's Road in 1897, and simple [[Polychrome|polychromatic]] brick cottages were built to commemorate [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee]].<ref name="NEB153">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=153.}}</ref> Much council building took place in the 1960s and 1970s, often in the form of tower blocks.<ref name="Argus-10647448"/> In Hove, the Conway Redevelopment Scheme lasted from April 1966 until July 1967.  Hundreds of slum houses were replaced by five towers with between 54 and 72 flats each; the ten-storey Conway Court is the tallest.  Dark red and buff brickwork, small areas of blue plastic panelling and recessed balconies characterise the buildings.<ref name="Middleton230<U+2013>231"/> About <U+00A3>2 million was spent.<ref name="Middleton232">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=232.}}</ref> In 1976<U+2013>77, old council houses in the Ingram Crescent area off Portland Road were replaced by low-rise flats in a modern style with varied architectural features such as [[Clapboard (architecture)|weatherboarding]]-style timber, dark brickwork and catslide roofs.<ref name="Middleton232"/> No council houses have been built since the 1980s, but in July 2010 the council announced plans to demolish Ainsworth House, a 1960s low-rise block near Elm Grove, and build a higher-density high-rise "family complex".<ref name="Argus-29072010">{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/8296707.First_new_council_houses_in_Brighton_for_30_years/?ref=mr|title=First new council houses in Brighton for 30 years|last=Ridgway|first=Tim|date=29 July 2010|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]]|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEPSXxVc|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Planning permission]] was granted in April 2011, and the 15-home development called Balchin Court was opened in September 2013.<ref name="Argus-10675069">{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10675069.Ribbon___s_cut_on_first_new_Brighton_and_Hove_council_housing_in_20_years/|title=Ribbon's cut on first new Brighton and Hove council housing in 20 years|last=Vowles|first=Neil|date=14 September 2013|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]]|accessdate=2 January 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MKdEwB4O|archivedate=2 January 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> In November 2011 [[Squatting|squatters]] occupied the building, which was in a dangerous condition because it contained [[asbestos]].<ref name="Argus-01122011">{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9397092.Brighton_new_homes_site_overrun_by_squatters/|title=Brighton new homes site overrun by squatters|last=Gardner|first=Bill|date=1 December 2011|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]]|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEPihUZZ|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The shortage of building materials caused by the First World War prompted the government to seek alternatives.  Hundreds of [[prefabricated home]]s were built, especially on the outskirts of the urban area,<ref name="NEB154">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=154.}}</ref> but more innovative were the two all-metal houses built in 1923 on the Pankhurst estate.  The government paid half the cost of construction of the "Weir Steel Homes".  They were demolished in 1969.<ref name="NEB153"/><ref name="Horlock56">{{Harvnb|Horlock|2010|p=56.}}</ref> In 1934, the New Zealand-based architecture firm Connell, Ward and Lucas built three [[Cubism|Cubist]] houses on a hillside site on the [[Saltdean]] estate<U+2014>among the earliest buildings of that style in Britain.  More were planned, in an attempt to demonstrate that the design could work on a large scale; but no more were built, although some later houses in the area adopted elements of the style.  Two of the three "iconoclast machines for living", as they were called in 1987, survive in much-altered form,<ref name="BoB125"/> "forlorn among their conformist brothers and sisters".  The starkly white-painted cubes were originally sold for <U+00A3>550.<ref name="Pevsner601">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=601.}}</ref>

The fields around the ancient village of Hove were owned by a few large landholders, whose gradual release of land for development in the 19th and early 20th centuries contributed to the town's distinctive pattern of growth: individual architects or firms designed small estates with a homogeneous overall style but with much variation between them.<ref name="Antram18">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=18.}}</ref> The Wick Estate's land was transformed between the 1820s and 1860s into the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick Town]] estate, consisting of grand [[Regency architecture|Regency]]/[[Classical architecture|Classical-style]] squares and crescents of houses, with smaller versions in grid-pattern side streets.<ref name="Antram112<U+2013>120">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=112<U+2013>120.}}</ref> Next came the Cliftonville estate, which filled the gap between Brunswick Town and Brighton.  Two-storey semi-detached [[stucco]]ed villas in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]], often with [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[bay window]]s, characterised the early part of the estate<U+2014>the long north<U+2013>south roads between Church Road and the seafront.  [[Hove railway station|Cliftonville (now Hove) railway station]] opened to the north in 1865, stimulating further development in a similar style.  A railway architect, [[Frederick Banister|F.D. Banister]], designed most of Cliftonville,<ref name="Antram194">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=194.}}</ref><ref name="Antram200">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=200.}}</ref> including number 42 Medina Villas (his own home during the 1850s) and three surrounding houses, whose [[Jacobethan]] red-brick exteriors and curved gables contrast with the surrounding villas.<ref name="Antram200"/> The West Brighton estate's rapid development began in 1872 on land bought from the Stanford family, the area's largest landholders.  Until the Stanford Estate [[Act of Parliament]] was passed in 1871, no houses could be built on the land, despite tremendous pressure for growth; within 12 years, {{convert|550|acre|ha}} were developed and Hove's housing stock had trebled.<ref name="Antram194"/> [[James Knowles (architect)|Sir James Knowles]] and [[Henry Jones Lanchester]] were the principal architects, and [[William Willett]] built the houses to a high standard.

Many flats and mansion blocks were built in Brighton, Hove and Portslade in the interwar and immediate postwar periods.  St Richard's Flats{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} (mid-1930s, by [[John Leopold Denman|Denman and Son]]), "cottagey and jazzy at the same time", are stuccoed with wooden balconies and a clay-tiled roof.  King George VI Mansions{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} at [[West Blatchington]] consist of three long groups of three-storey brick and tile terraces forming a quadrangle around an area of open space; designed by T. Garratt and Sons in the "[[Vernacular architecture|Vernacular Revival]]" style, they are little changed since their construction.  Wick Hall{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} (1936) and Furze Croft{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} (1937, by Toms and Partners) occupy the old gardens of the original Wick Hall mansion.  Their "elegant" form and high quality makes them "well-respected local landmark[s]".  Furze Croft retains its [[Crittall Windows|Crittall steel windows]] and is characteristic of the 1930s [[Moderne architecture|Moderne style]].  Courtney Gate{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} occupies a prime site on Hove seafront; designed in 1934, it rises to seven storeys and has good architectural detail.  In The Drive in Hove, numbers 20 and 22{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} are brick- and stone-built flats which enhance the streetscape of this important residential road; number 22 was "designed to resemble a castle".  [[John Leopold Denman]]'s Harewood Court{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} (1950s), built for the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution, is a seven-storey brick-built block in the [[Art Deco]] style.<ref name="B&HLocalList2012"/> Nearby, at the junction of The Drive and Cromwell Road, Eaton Manor{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} dates from 1968<U+2013>72, rises to eight storeys and contains over 100 flats.  It is described on the local list as "handsome ... well articulated ... [and] an excellent example of the type".<ref name="B&HLocalList2012"/>

For many years, convalescent homes and similar institutions have taken advantage of the mild climate and sea air.  The Convalescent Police Seaside Home in Hove was Britain's first when it opened in 1890 in a house in Clarendon Villas.  Almost immediately, architect J.G. Gibbins was engaged to design a purpose-built home on land nearby.  This plot on Portland Road was in "a charming position, [...] open to the sea" at the time.  [[William Willett]] erected the building, which opened in July 1893.  The red-brick home has [[gable]]d roofs, substantial chimney-stacks and a visually prominent entrance, and is a dominant presence on Portland Road.<ref name="EncH&Pv10p49">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 10, p. 49.}}</ref> The home moved to Kingsway in 1966, and East Sussex County Council converted the old building into the Portland House Nursing Home.<ref name="EncH&Pv10p63">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 10, p. 63.}}</ref> The French government paid for a large home to be built on the cliffs at [[Black Rock (Brighton and Hove)|Black Rock]] in 1895<U+2013>98.  The [[ch<U+00E2>teau]]-like [[French Convalescent Home, Brighton|French Convalescent Home]] was converted into flats in 1999, but retains its slate [[Mansard roof|mansard-roofed]] corner pavilions, gabled entrance and garden-facing colonnade.  The [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance Revival style]] chosen by architects [[Clayton & Black]] contrasts with surrounding seafront developments.  [[Blind Veterans UK|St Dunstan's]], a charity which looks after blind former members of the Armed Forces, is based at [[Ovingdean]], and its rest and rehabilitation home is based on a prominent downland site overlooking the [[A259 road|coast road]].  The Burnet, Tait and Lorne Partnership's [[International Style (architecture)|International]] [[Modern architecture|Modern]] steel-frame and pale brick home has a [[cruciform]] plan with a symmetrical west-facing fa<U+00E7>ade.  Some windows are recessed, and others are flanked by brown-tiled columns.  Described as "slightly reminiscent of [[Charles Holden]]'s [[London Underground]] stations", its shape recalls that of a biplane.  A low chapel in front is topped by a Winged Victory sculpture.<ref name="BeeversRoles-64">{{Harvnb|Beevers|Roles|1993|p=64.}}</ref>

===Commercial and industrial architecture===
The redevelopment of Brighton's three major commercial streets<U+2014>North Street, West Street and Western Road<U+2014>in the 1930s means that they are now characterised by distinctive interwar commercial buildings.  Western Road has "a good run of large" department stores and other shops:<ref name="Antram160">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=160.}}</ref> a ship-like [[Art Deco]] corner building by Garrett & Son (1934) incorporating [[Clayton & Black]]'s Imperial Arcade{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} (1924), the [[Moderne architecture|Moderne]] former Wade's (now New Look) and Woolworth's stores (1928), the British Home Stores (1931 by Garrett & Son; now Primark) and the Stafford's hardware shop (1930; now Poundland) in [[Architecture of the United States#Gilded Age and turn of the 20th century|American-influenced]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Continental European]]-influenced versions of the [[Classical architecture|Classical style]] and both decorated with elaborate motifs, and the "unusually palatial" [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] Boots the Chemist (1927<U+2013>28; now McDonald's).<ref name="Antram161">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=161.}}</ref><ref name="NEB367">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=367.}}</ref> Covering the block between Dean and Spring Streets, its stone fa<U+00E7>ade has four evenly spaced [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] in the centre of the upper storey<U+2014>originally a restaurant and tearoom which featured regular orchestral performances.<ref name="Clunn74">{{Harvnb|Clunn|1953|p=74.}}</ref><ref name="EncB207">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=<U+00A7>207.}}</ref> Mitre House is a monolithic red-brick and stone structure dating from 1935.

Derek Sharp of Comprehensive Design Group undertook the work, but it the building was re-clad and redesigned in 1998, losing the original impact.  [[Waterstones]] bookshop opposite, designed for [[Burton (clothing)|Burtons]] in 1928 for their in-house architect Harry Wilson, has a Classical theme with full-height [[pilaster]]s.<ref name="NewPevsner215">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=215.}}</ref>

Several financial services companies made Hove their base in the late 20th century.  The Sussex Mutual Building Society's new head office on Western Road (1975), called "one of the finest new office buildings in the locality" in contemporary reports, is a well-lit slate-roofed building with a glazed clay mosaic mural depicting scenes from Sussex, designed by Philippa Threlfall.<ref name="Middleton232"/> The Alliance Building Society's three-storey steel-framed head office building at Hove Park was designed in the 1960s by Jackson, Greenen and Down, who gained the commission at the end of a competition started in 1956.   It had strong horizontal lines offset by granite columns and tall, narrow steel-framed windows.<ref name="Middleton234">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=234.}}</ref> On its opening in 1967, it was anticipated to be "a great contribution to the architectural thought of the 20th century"; but by the 1980s it was derided as a "carbuncle" and a "white elephant", its stark Modernist form having dated badly.  The merged and greatly enlarged [[Alliance & Leicester]] Building Society moved out in 1994 and the building was knocked down in 2001.  David Richmond and Partners' <U+00A3>65 million "City Park" scheme, consisting of houses and three curved-roofed office blocks rising to four storeys, replaced it.<ref name="EncH&Pv1p51<U+2013>52">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 1, pp. 51<U+2013>52.}}</ref> The [[Legal & General]] insurance company moved there from their earlier home at the former Hanningtons furniture depository on Montefiore Road (now the [[Montefiore Hospital, Hove|Montefiore Hospital]]); architects Devereux and Partners had "elegantly converted" this 1904 building for its new purpose in 1972.<ref name="BoB98">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic.

Brighton's [[parish church]], [[St Nicholas' Church, Brighton|dedicated to St Nicholas]], dates from the 14th century,<ref name="Antram158">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=158.}}</ref> [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church at Hove]] is a century older,<ref name="Antram4">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=4.}}</ref> and the formerly outlying villages of [[Ovingdean]], [[Hangleton]], [[Rottingdean]], [[West Blatchington]] and [[Portslade]] have even more ancient buildings at their heart.  Nevertheless, the defining characteristic of Brighton and Hove's religious architecture is the exceptional range of richly designed, landmark [[Victorian era|Victorian]] churches<U+2014>particularly those built for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] community.<ref name="Antram15"/> The city's stock of such churches is one of the best outside London: this is attributable to the influence of fashionable society and the money it brought, and to the efforts of two Vicars of Brighton, Henry Michell Wagner and his son Arthur, to endow and build new churches throughout Brighton's rapidly developing suburbs and poor districts.  Both men were rich and were willing to pay for well-designed, attractive and even flamboyant buildings by well-known architects such as [[Benjamin Ferrey]], [[Richard Cromwell Carpenter]] and [[George Frederick Bodley]].  An early preference for the [[Classical architecture|Classical style]], as at Christ Church (now demolished) and [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, Brighton|St John the Evangelist's]] at [[Carlton Hill, Brighton|Carlton Hill]], gave way to various forms of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] design<U+2014>principally in the starkly plain form of the gigantic [[St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton|St Bartholomew's Church]] and the even larger [[St Martin's Church, Brighton|St Martin's]], whose fixtures and furnishings are classed among the best in England.<ref name="Antram15<U+2013>16">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=15<U+2013>16.}}</ref> However, [[Charles Barry]]'s imposingly sited [[St Paul's Church, Brighton|St Paul's Church]] (1824), which began the Gothic trend,<ref name="Antram15"/> was not commissioned by the Wagners; nor were Hove's new parish church, the Grade I-listed [[All Saints Church, Hove|All Saints]] (1889<U+2013>91) or Cliftonville's [[St Barnabas Church, Hove|St Barnabas']] (1882<U+2013>83), both by [[John Loughborough Pearson]].<ref name="Antram16">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=16.}}</ref> [[St Michael's Church, Brighton|St Michael and All Angels Church]], built in two stages by Bodley (1858<U+2013>61) and [[William Burges]] (1893<U+2013>95), was established by Rev. Charles Beanlands, a [[curate]] under Arthur Wagner at St Paul's.  The two parts, in different interpretations of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]], harmonise well, and the interior (mostly by [[W. H. Romaine-Walker]]) is one of the city's grandest.<ref name="Antram48<U+2013>50">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=48<U+2013>50.}}</ref> The present [[St Mary the Virgin, Brighton|St Mary the Virgin Church]] is the second on the site: [[Amon Henry Wilds]]'s Classical building collapsed during renovation and was replaced in 1877<U+2013>79 by [[William Emerson (architect)|William Emerson]]'s "dynamic" Early English/French Gothic design<U+2014>his only church in England.<ref name="Antram16"/><ref name="Antram137">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=137.}}</ref>

Anglican churches continued to be built in the 20th century.  The stripped-down [[Gothic Revival architecture#The 20th century|Modern Gothic]] of [[Edward Maufe]]'s [[Bishop Hannington Memorial Church]] (1938<U+2013>39), with its "simple and gracious interior", has been called "Historicism at its most simplified".<ref name="NHLE-1298638">{{NHLE|desc=Bishop Hannington Memorial Church, Holmes Avenue, Brighton|num=1298638|grade=II|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="Pevsner431">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=431.}}</ref> The Gothic Revival style was also used for [[Edward Prioleau Warren]]'s [[Church of the Good Shepherd, Brighton|Church of the Good Shepherd]] (1921<U+2013>22) and Lacy Ridge's St Matthias Church (1907), with its round tower and hammerbeam roof.

[[File:City of Brighton and Hove Buildings Montage - Town Halls.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Clockwise from top left: Brunswick (former), Brighton, Portslade and Hove Town Halls]]
Brighton, Hove, Brunswick Town and Portslade have each had a [[Seat of local government|town hall]], but only those at Hove and Brighton are still in use and Hove's was rebuilt after a fire.  Medieval Brighthelmston used a building (called the Townhouse) which was more of a market hall, and a later building (1727) known as the Town Hall was principally used as a [[workhouse]].<ref name="NEB341">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=341.}}</ref> Work on the first purpose-built town hall began in 1830; [[Thomas Read Kemp]] laid the first stone, and Thomas Cooper designed it on behalf of the Brighton Town Commissioners (of which he was a member).  Brighton Corporation spent <U+00A3>40,000 to extend it in 1897<U+2013>99, to the design of Francis May.  Its severe [[Classical architecture|Classical design]], with huge [[Ionic order|Ionic column]]s and wide staircases, was criticised in the 19th century, and May's infilling of the [[cruciform]] building's wings affected the composition's symmetry.  Nevertheless, [[English Heritage]] has awarded it Grade II listed status.<ref name="NEB341<U+2013>342">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=341<U+2013>342.}}</ref><ref name="Antram72">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=72.}}</ref><ref name="BoB36">{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic.

Brunswick Town Hall, built on behalf of the Brunswick Square Commissioners, was the first town hall in the Hove area.<ref name="EncH&Pv8p184">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 8, p. 184.}}</ref> Its Classical-style stucco fa<U+00E7>ade concealed stone and brickwork.  It cost <U+00A3>3,000 and opened in 1856.  The three-storey building served Brunswick Town and Hove jointly from 1873, when the Hove Commissioners moved in; but more space was needed, so leading Victorian Gothic Revival architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] was controversially commissioned to design a new building on a large site bought from the Stanford Estate's land.<ref name="Middleton78+80">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=78, 80.}}</ref> The Brunswick building, at 64 Brunswick Street West, passed into commercial use, is now part of the [[Brighton Institute of Modern Music]],<ref name="BIMM">{{cite web|url=http://www.bimm.co.uk/brighton/contact-us|title=Contact us|year=2012|publisher=[[Brighton Institute of Modern Music]]|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEW2S2bC|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> and is Grade II-listed.<ref name="NHLE-1187545">{{NHLE|desc=64, Brunswick Street West, BN3 1EL, Brighton|num=1187545|grade=II|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>

Waterhouse was thought by some Hove Commissioners to be too important an architect to design Hove's new town hall,<ref name="EncH&Pv8p184"/> but work went ahead in 1880 and it opened in 1882.  Local housebuilder J.T.

The city's main fire station faces the five-road junction of Preston Circus,<ref name="Antram182">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=182.}}</ref> near London Road viaduct.  Established on the site of a brewery of 1901, the building was redesigned in 1938; Graeme Highet won the commission in competition.  His plain brick exterior, curving gently round the road, combines "restrained [[Modernism]]" with more old-fashioned elements such as a canopied entrance and windows with prominent [[architrave]]s.  Sculptor [[Joseph Cribb]] provided carved [[relief]]s for the main doors.<ref name="Antram182<U+2013>183">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|pp=182<U+2013>183.}}</ref> Portslade's former fire station{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} operated from 1909 until about 1941<ref name="EncH&Pv10p95">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 10, p. 95.}}</ref> and passed into commercial use in 1972.<ref name="EncH&Pv10p96">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 10, p. 96.}}</ref> District Surveyor A.

Brighton's main hospitals are the [[Royal Sussex County Hospital]] (RSCH) in Kemptown and the [[Brighton General Hospital]] at the top of Elm Grove on Race Hill.  The former was built in several stages.  Charles Barry's original buildings (1826<U+2013>28) are [[Classical architecture|Classical]] and [[pediment]]ed; William Hallett and Herbert Williams built three complementary extensions between them by 1853; Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn added the similar Jubilee Building in 1887; Cawthorn built the prominently gabled Outpatients' Building in 1892; [[John Leopold Denman]]'s Eye Hospital in 1935 is in his characteristic Neo-Georgian style; and Robin Beynon's 2002<U+2013>05 work on the Audrey Emerton Building reflects Regency-style themes of stuccoed bowed fa<U+00E7>ades.<ref name="NewPevsner197"/> Brighton General was originally the town's [[workhouse]].  Designed in 1853 but not built until 1865<U+2013>67, it is in a "debased" Italianate style with a long frontage flanked by pavilions.  George Maynard and J.C. & G. Lansdown were responsible.  More buildings were added in 1887, 1891 and 1898 to the rear.<ref name="NewPevsner197"/>

The [[Royal Alexandra Hospital, Brighton|Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital]] has occupied two buildings of markedly different architectural character.  [[Thomas Lainson]]'s [[Queen Anne style architecture#British 19th-century Queen Anne style|Queen Anne Revival-style]] building of 1880<U+2013>81 in the Montpelier district was distinguished by its [[Dutch gable]]s and much use of terracotta and red brick.  [[Clayton & Black]] added a colonnade and other parts in 1906, and a major extension (again with prominent gables) was undertaken in 1927 by W.H. Overton.<ref name="NewPevsner237">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=237.}}</ref> It closed in 2007 after its replacement opened next to the RSCH,<ref name="NEB288">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=288.}}</ref> and has been redeveloped for housing.

Hove's first hospital{{refn|group=LLB|name=LLB}} was a "classic Victorian building" on Sackville Road, built in 1885<U+2013>88 by John T. Chappell.  Architects Clarke & Micklethwaite designed the red-brick hospital, which had prominent chimneys on a slate roof, [[crow-stepped gable]]s and a large [[terracotta]] panel with various inscriptions.<ref name="EncH&Pv7p118<U+2013>119"/> Closure was announced in 1994, and a local property development firm paid <U+00A3>550,000 for the building in 1998.  Under the guidance of scheme architect Christopher Dodd, it was converted into 37 [[housing association]] flats called ''Tennyson Court'', retaining all original architectural features.<ref name="EncH&Pv7p120<U+2013>121">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 7, pp. 120<U+2013>121.}}</ref> A<U+00A3>5 million replacement, the Hove Polyclinic, opened in West Blatchington in October 1998.

Gilbert Simpson originally worked with his father in the firm Thomas Simpson & Son.<ref name="NewPevsner67"/> Thomas Simpson's former board schools of the post-1870 period (most were designed between 1880 and 1903) can be found throughout the city.<ref name="NewPevsner196"/> Architecturally, his schools are "the best [such] works" in Sussex.<ref name="NewPevsner67">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=67.}}</ref> His style evolved from the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne Revival]] typical of early board schools towards "an [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian Free style]]" in which the standard red brickwork is supplemented by pebbledashing, terracotta and stonework.  His rooflines became more elaborate over time as well.<ref name="NewPevsner196"/> The Finsbury Road School (1881; now flats) combines red and brown brickwork.  Connaught Road School in Hove (1884) and Elm Grove School in Brighton (1893) are in the Queen Anne Revival style; the former, now an adult education centre, combines yellow and red brick and terracotta-coloured render to create an "elegant" and "distinctive" fa<U+00E7>ade.

The Brighton Dome complex incorporates the [[Studio Theatre (Brighton)|Studio Theatre]], Corn Exchange and a concert hall.

Atkinson's additions included the theatre, which faces New Road.  All of these schemes retained the Indian/[[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectural influences of Porden's work.

The Goldstone Ground was laid out on the Stanford family's land in Hove in 1901 for Hove F.C. but was taken on by Albion in 1902.  A.E. Lewer designed a pavilion and dressing rooms, and the West Stand was extended to the design of A. & W. Elliott in 1920.  The South Stand was reused from an event at Preston Park.  The stands were later replaced and refurbished several times, and floodlights were installed in 1961.  The site was controversially sold in 1995<ref name="EncH&Pv2p101<U+2013>103">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2003|loc=Vol. 2, pp. 101<U+2013>103.}}</ref> and is now occupied by the Goldstone Retail Park.

The seafront was originally dominated by defensive structures and [[Artillery battery#Fixed battery|batteries]], including some designed by [[James Wyatt]].<ref name="NewPevsner 53">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=53.}}</ref> As the threat of foreign invasion lessened in the 19th century, Brighton and Hove's seafront was redeveloped with pleasure and recreation as its focus, and from the 1860s it represented "the [[Id<U+00E9>e fixe (psychology)|id<U+00E9>e fixe]] of how [a seafront] should look".<ref name="NewPevsner68">{{Harvnb|Antram|Pevsner|2013|p=68.}}</ref> Bandstands, elaborately roofed kiosks, shelters with decorative awnings, pale green railings and tall, ornate lamp-posts are found regularly along the whole seafront; most structures date from the late 19th century<ref name="NewPevsner68"/> and many are Grade II-listed.<ref name="SummaryList"/>

The [[West Pier]] (1863<U+2013>66 by [[Eugenius Birch]]), dedicated entirely to leisure and promenading, was "one of the most important piers ever built"<U+2014>but after its closure in 1975 it decayed, caught fire twice and is now a rusting hulk stranded in the sea.  Many of its features were innovative, from the [[Screwpiles|screw pile foundations]] developed by [[Alexander Mitchell (engineer)|Alexander Mitchell]] to the Royal Pavilion-inspired Orientalist kiosks and other buildings which defined how seaside architecture should be.  Further dome-topped entertainment venues were added in 1893 and 1916; the first of these was built because a new rival had appeared closer to the centre of Brighton.<ref name="Antram21">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=21.}}</ref> Between 1891 and 1901, <U+00A3>137,000 was spent on the [[Brighton Pier|Palace Pier]].{{refn|group=Note|Now branded ''Brighton Pier''; originally called the ''Marine Palace Pier''.<ref name="Antram59">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=59.}}</ref>}}  It was built by Arthur Mayoh to a design by R.

Birch was also responsible for Brighton Aquarium (now the Sea Life Centre) in 1872.  The 21-bay double-aisled interior remains as built, but of his [[High Victorian Gothic]]-style work on the exterior only an "attention-seeking clock tower" survives,{{refn|group=Note|This is no longer on the Aquarium: it was moved to the entrance of the nearby Palace Pier.<ref name="Argus-10389544"/>}} because the building was revamped in 1927<U+2013>29 by the Borough Surveyor David Edwards.

===Transport and other architecture===
[[File:Portslade Station 5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Portslade railway station]] has [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] overtones.]]
[[Brighton railway station]], a Grade II*-listed structure, was built in two parts.  Most of [[David Mocatta]]'s [[stucco]]ed [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building of 1841 survives<U+2014>albeit hidden by H.E. Wallis's extensions of 1882<U+2013>83.  He added an elaborate iron [[porte-coch<U+00E8>re]] over the forecourt and an impressive curved [[train shed]], 21 [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] and {{convert|597|ft|m}} long, at the rear.  Its glazed three-span roof is supported on octagonal [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] columns.  F.D.

Trams (from 1901) and trolleybuses used to run in Brighton.  The Lewes Road Bus Garage was originally the Brighton Corporation Tramways depot; it retains windows etched with this name.  Wooden tram shelters survive on Dyke Road, Ditchling Road and Queen's Park Road.  They have been turned into bus shelters,<ref name="NEB342<U+2013>343">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=342<U+2013>343.}}</ref> and the same has happened in [[Old Steine]] with a series of trolleybus shelters designed in 1939 by Borough Surveyor David Edwards.  The cream-coloured structures have curved windows and flat roofs with similarly curved ends which oversail the shelter itself.

==Heritage and conservation==

Buildings have been lost to fire, damage or demolition since the urban area's earliest days, and the frequent replacement of buildings (even those with architectural merit) by Victorian-era speculators was particularly common along the seafront.<ref name="Crisis17">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1990|p=17.}}</ref> After World War II, Brighton's seaside resort function declined, demand for housing rose and it became an important regional commercial centre.<ref name="Crisis3"/> Pressure for redevelopment and the prevailing attitudes towards pre-20th century architecture resulted in widespread demolition; many of the new buildings were architecturally unsuccessful because their scale, build quality and relationship with their surroundings were poor.<ref name="Crisis6">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1990|p=6.}}</ref> In other cases, large sites stayed vacant for decades pending redevelopment.<ref name="Crisis17"/> The city faces unusually severe geographical constraints<U+2014>it lies between the [[English Channel]] and the [[South Downs]] (an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]), and has continuous urban development to the east and west<U+2014>and intense pressure for redevelopment continues.<ref name="Crisis20">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1990|p=20.}}</ref> Nevertheless, many buildings have also been saved<U+2014>not least the Royal Pavilion, which was bought by the local authorities when [[Queen Victoria]] moved out and which faced another threat in the 1930s.<ref name="Antram26">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=26.}}</ref>

National conservation groups such as [[The Victorian Society]] and [[Georgian Group|The Georgian Group]] are active in the city, and the Regency Society was founded in 1945 to conserve Brighton's architectural heritage in a direct response to Herbert Carden's proposals for wholesale reconstruction.<ref name="Antram26"/><ref name="TRS-Home">{{cite web|url=http://regencysociety.org/|title=If you care about our city, this is your home|year=2011|publisher=The Regency Society|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEWLBRCn|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Residents' groups such as the [[Regency Square, Brighton|Regency Square]] Area Society undertake similar work at a local level.  The Victorian Society and The Georgian Group wrote a joint report in 1990 examining postwar developments in central Brighton in the context of the older surroundings.  It observed that the growth of Brighton as a commercial centre since World War II had damaged its character: "grossly inappropriate commercial development" was starting to dominate the traditional seaside resort architecture characterised by the Regency terraces and squares, the piers and the Royal Pavilion.<ref name="Crisis3"/>

Postwar demolition and redevelopment has been extensive in places.  An especially infamous incident occurred in 1971, when Stroud and Mew's "Regency Gothic" Central National School in the North Laine was knocked down<ref name="BeeversRoles-77">{{Harvnb|Beevers|Roles|1993|p=77.}}</ref> hours before its listed status was granted: the letter was apparently delayed by a postal strike.  The building dated from 1830 and was founded by Vicar of Brighton Henry Michell Wagner.<ref name="BeeversRoles-77"/>  Another school, the Brighton Asylum for the Blind on Eastern Road (designed by George Somers Clarke, architect of the similarly flamboyant [[11 Dyke Road, Brighton|Swan Downer School on Dyke Road]]) was "tragically demolished" thirteen years earlier.

Road schemes have long been a source of demolition and redevelopment: as early as 1902, part of the historic Brighton Brewery was removed to remove a notorious bottleneck (known locally as "The Bunion") on Church Road in Hove.<ref name="Scott87">{{Harvnb|Scott|1995|loc=<U+00A7>. 87.}}</ref> Large-scale projects then threatened several parts of central Brighton between the 1960s and 1990s, but all were abandoned.

In England, a building or structure is defined as "listed" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest" by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], a Government department, in accordance with the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]].<ref name="PLBCA">{{cite web|title=Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (c. 9)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/contents|publisher=Ministry of Justice|date=24 May 1990|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEa8Oyby|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[English Heritage]], a [[non-departmental public body]], acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues.<ref name="EH1">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/who-we-are/how-we-are-run/what-we-do/|title=What English Heritage Does|year=2012|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEaJIacG|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> As of February 2001, Brighton and Hove had 24 Grade I-listed buildings, 70 with a status of Grade II* and 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings.<ref name="IoEStats-ESx">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2013> Statistics by County (East Sussex)|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=EAST%20SUSSEX|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEanhkvP|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Brighton and Hove City Council issues periodic summarised updates of the city's listed building stock; the latest document was published in May 2012.<ref name="SummaryList">{{cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/conservation/LB-03_B_H_SumList__Hist_Bldgs_2012-05-18.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Brighton and Hove Summary Lists of Historic Buildings (ENS/CR/LB/03)|date=18 May 2012|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council (Environment Department, Design & Conservation Team)|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref>

Grade I, the highest status, indicates that a building is of "exceptional interest" and greater than national importance.  Grade II* is used for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest"; and Grade II, the lowest designation, is used for "nationally important buildings of special interest".<ref name="EH2">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/|title=Listed Buildings|year=2012|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEarkz4v|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> All three grades of [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed status]] offer some protection against changes which would affect the structure's character, from interior restoration to demolition.

Failure to do so can result in an unlimited fine, 12 months' imprisonment, or both.|"Effects of Listing" statement in the ''List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historical Interest for Brighton'', 1981}}

Buildings listed at Grade I include the [[Royal Pavilion]], [[Stanmer House]], several churches, the wrecked [[West Pier]], the main building at the [[University of Sussex]] and the principal parts of the Kemp Town and Brunswick estates.  Several other 19th-century residential developments have Grade II* status: among them are [[Royal Crescent, Brighton|Royal]], [[Park Crescent, Brighton|Park]] and Adelaide Crescents, [[Regency Square, Brighton|Regency Square]] and Oriental Place.  Many more churches also have this grading.  Grade II-listed buildings and structures are varied: items of street furniture (such as parish boundary markers and lamp-posts) have been listed, as have dovecots, gazebos and chimneys; hundreds of houses and cottages, either individually or as part of terraces, are included; and churches, schools and other public buildings (such as Brighton Town Hall, [[Portslade railway station]] and many pubs) have also been given Grade II status.<ref name="SummaryList"/>

Listed buildings have occasionally been lost to fire or demolition, and are not always delisted (officially removed from the schedule of listed buildings).  The West Pier retains Grade I listed status despite its ruined, inaccessible condition; and permission to demolish a Grade II-listed house at 128 King's Road near Regency Square was granted in 2002 after it was damaged by fire.<ref name="B&H-App-2002-02957LB">{{cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1199915&action=showDetail&application_number=BH2002%2F02957%2FLB|title=128 Kings Road Brighton|publisher=Brighton and Hove City Council|date=12 November 2002|work=Brighton and Hove City Council planning application number BH2002/02957/LB|quote=Demolition of existing fire damaged Grade II Listed Building and erection of new seven-storey (over basement) building comprising six no. two bedroom flats and one no. two bedroom maisonette|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DEau0SoE|archivedate=27 December 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Holy Trinity Church, Hove|Holy Trinity Church]] in Hove, declared redundant in 2010, has been threatened with demolition since 2008.<ref name="BBCSCR">{{cite web|title=Has God's gem lost its sparkle?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/content/articles/2008/09/25/endangered_church_feature.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 September 2008|work=[[BBC Southern Counties Radio]] website|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MGED2ojY|archivedate=30 December 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> Elsewhere, in July 2010 the council announced they would move a Grade II-listed shelter on the seafront by {{convert|3|ft|m|sigfig=0}} to reduce the danger to cyclists on an adjacent cycle lane.<ref name="Argus-27072010">{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/8293147.Listed_Brighton_building_to_be_moved_one_metre/?ref=mr|title=Listed Brighton building to be moved one metre|last=Ridgway|first=Tim|date=27 July 2010|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]]|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MGE6oOC3|archivedate=30 December 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Since around 1990, the various councils (and later subsequently the city council) have surveyed the structural condition of all listed buildings and have provided funding "to encourage the preservation of the city's historic building stock", covering repairs to listed and other historic buildings, replacement of missing or damaged architectural or decorative features, and assistance to return at-risk buildings to suitable use.  As early as 2003, though, the city council reported that a change in the way grants were structured meant that financial help for specific buildings may decline in favour of spending money on enhancements to wider areas.<ref name="ECMM-Jul2008">{{cite web|url=http://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000286/M00001361/$$ADocPackPublic.pdf|title=Minutes of Environment Cabinet Member Meeting|date=4 July 2008|page=101|format=PDF|publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MGEdm5oX|archivedate=30 December 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>
