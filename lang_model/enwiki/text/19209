==History==
Founded in 1918, GM Canada was formed by the purchase of the [[McLaughlin automobile|McLaughlin Motor Car Co.]], manufacturer since 1907<ref>http://www.canadiandriver.com/2005/06/17/motoring-memories-mclaughlin-buick.htm</ref> of the McLaughlin automobile based on the Buick Model F, Canadianized with a McLaughlin carriage as its body. From 1910 onward, the cars were well-known across [[Canada]] as McLaughlin-Buicks and prominently identified as such, in recognition of their Buick heritage. Prior to becoming GM Canada, McLaughlin had acquired the approval of [[William C. Durant]], then owner of the Chevrolet Motor Co. and preceding its entry into the GM product line, to produce [[Chevrolet]] automobiles in Canada, along with the McLaughlin-Buicks.<ref>http://www.gm.ca/inm/gmcanada/english/about/OverviewHist/hist_gm_canada.html</ref>

It is a private [[subsidiary]] that is wholly owned by [[General Motors]], so information such as assets, revenues, and profits is not disclosed. Nonetheless, GM Canada has historically been one of the largest and most powerful corporations in Canada, being listed as the third "largest" in 1975, and being comparable to several publicly traded companies such as [[Bell Canada|BCE]], [[George Weston Limited]], and [[Royal Bank of Canada]].<ref>[http://www.lib.uwo.ca/business/200TopCompanies.html The Top 200 - Canada's Largest Companies c1973-74 - Business<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

General Motors of Canada opened its new head office building on the shore of [[Lake Ontario]] in 1989. It is a fixture on [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] and usually displays an enormous picture of a new vehicle on the outside of its huge atrium.

GM's Canadian Regional Engineering Centre opened in June, 2001.  It is primarily responsible for managing the design and validation of vehicles which are manufactured in Canada, though it supports many joint development efforts with GM operations in other countries.

The manufacturing plants located in Oshawa produce the all-new fifth generation [[Chevrolet Camaro]], Chevrolet Impala, Buick Allure (rebadged as the LaCrosse for the U.S. market) as well as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. The three plants have continually garnered top quality ratings by J.D. Power.<ref>[http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/ J.D. Power and Associates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Oshawa facility was ranked number 1 facility in overall quality in North and South America by [[J.D. Power and Associates]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

General Motors of Canada announced a [[naming rights]] deal for the [[General Motors Centre]] on October 5, 2006. The centre's main tenants will be the [[Oshawa Generals]] Junior hockey team, who were named for the corporation in 1937.

On 27 April 2009, GM Canada announced that it would cut over half of its Canadian jobs and close 40% of its Canadian dealerships by 2014 in response to its parent company's dire financial straits.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2009/04/27/gm-pontiac-gone.html]</ref>

== 2008 Canadian Auto Workers bargaining==
{{Expand|section|date=June 2008}}
In an unusual move, General Motors and the [[Canadian Auto Workers]] union reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining contract on May 15, 2008, a full four months before the existing contract was due to expire. As part of the agreement, GM pledged to maintain production at the Oshawa, Ontario pickup truck plant and made other production commitments.

On June 3, 2008, less than three weeks after ratification of the new contract, GM announced that, due to soaring gasoline prices and plummeting truck sales, it would close four additional truck and SUV plants, including the [[Oshawa Truck Assembly|Oshawa pickup plant]].<ref>http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=3&docid=46161</ref>

In response, the CAW organized a blockade of the GM of Canada headquarters in Oshawa. The blockade was ended by an Ontario Superior Court order, after 12 days. Further discussions between GM and the CAW resulted in an agreement to compensate workers at the truck plant and additional product commitments for the [[Oshawa Car Assembly|Oshawa car assembly plant]].<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080728.RGM28/TPStory/Business</ref>
