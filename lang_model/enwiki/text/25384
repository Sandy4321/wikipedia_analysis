==Biography==
===Early career===
Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu was born in [[Brest, France|Brest]] on the [[7 August]] [[1889]], in a family of Navy officers. He joined the ''<U+00C9>cole navale'' (Naval Academy) at 17.

He served on the ''Du Chayla'' as a midshipman, taking part in the campaign in [[Morocco]] which led to the [[Treaty of Fez]], in 1912. During the campaign, he was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]], and befriended [[Louis-Hubert Lyautey]], something that d'Argenlieu later recalled as one of the happy memories in his life.

===First World War===
During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Mediterranean]]; in 1915, he took his first steps toward joining a monastic order, while continuing to serve in the Navy; he was promoted to ''[[Ranks in the French Navy|lieutenant de vaisseau]]'' in 1917. The next year, commanding officer of a patrol boat, the ''Tourterelle'', he distinguished himself in the rescue of a troop transport.

===Religious career===
At the end of the war, d'Argenlieu undertook theological studies in Rome, and joined the 
religious order of the [[Discalced Carmelites]] as Louis de la Trinit<U+00E9>. He made his vow on [[15 September]] [[1921]], and studies for four years in the Catholic university of [[Lille]].

In 1932, he was made Provincial Superior of Paris.

===Second World War===
In September 1939, d'Argenlieu was mobilised as a reserve Navy officer, rising to the rank of ''[[Ranks in the French Navy|capitaine de corvette]]'' in 1940. During the [[Battle of France]], d'Argenlieu was captured as he was defending the arsenal of [[Cherbourg]]. After three days, he escaped from the prisoner train to Germany and joined [[Charles de Gaulle]] on the [[30 June]].

D'Argenlieu joined the [[Free French Forces]], intending to serve as chaplain, but eventually took on the duties of a fighting naval officer, with a special authorisation of his religious superiors, due to the small number of Navy officers in the [[Free French Naval Forces]]. He was made chief of staff in July.

He attempted to convince the then [[Vichy France|Vichy-loyal]] governor of [[Dakar]] to join De Gaulle, and was severely wounded when he was fired upon in his small and unarmed craft on September 23, [[1940]], during [[battle of Dakar]]. In November, he [[Battle of Gabon|directed successful operations]] in [[Gabon]].

D'Argenlieu was made a ''[[Ranks in the French Navy|capitaine de vaisseau]]'', and chancellor of the newly created ''[[Ordre de la Lib<U+00E9>ration]]''. In 1941, he rose to [[counter-admiral]]; he undertook several missions to administrate French colonies loyal of the [[Free France]].

In 1943, he was made commanding officer for the naval forces in [[Great Britain]] On the [[14 June]] [[1944]], he ferried De Gaulle to France aboard the ''[[French destroyer La Combattante|Combattante]]'', and entered Paris with him on the [[25 August]].

===First Indochina War===
After the defeat of Japan, d'Argenlieu was sent to [[French Indochina]] as part of the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] to restore the French colonial administration. In 1946, he was promoted to ''[[Ranks in the French Navy|vice-amiral d'escadre]]'', and soon later to [[admiral]].

During the [[First Indochina War]], the actions of d'Argenlieu grew more and more controversial, and he was replaced by [[Emile Bollaert]] in March 1947. Back to France, he was made inspector general of the Naval Forces, before retiring in a convent.

===After the War===
In 1958, sick, he resigned his position of chancellor of the ''[[Ordre de la Lib<U+00E9>ration]]'' and withdrew to monastery life again. He and died on the [[7 September]] [[1964]] in Brest. He was buried in Avrechy-d'Argenlieu.
