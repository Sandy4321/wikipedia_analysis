'''Al Hilal''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: <U+0646><U+0627><U+062F><U+064A> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0647><U+0644><U+0627><U+0644> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0633><U+0648><U+062F><U+0627><U+0646><U+064A>) is a [[Sudanese]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club founded on [[February 13]], [[1930]] in the city of [[Omdurman]].  It has been crowned champion of the [[Sudan Premier League]] in each of the past four seasons, and throughout its history has won the championship 24 times during that League's 42 seasons - thus making it Sudan's winningest [[football (soccer)|football]] team.

== Name and history ==

The name ''Hilal'' is the Arabic word for crescent - a name chosen on a a night when the crescent of the moon was visible in Omdurman.

===Idea===

During the late twenties and early thirties of the twentieth century, on the heels of a failed uprising by pro Egyptian elements antagonistic to the Anglo part of the then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], the British colonial authorities banned many activities and organizations that could potentially disrupt their hold on the region. The only organized activities permitted were sports clubs and scouting. 

In 1930, four graduates from [[Gordon Memorial College]] (now the [[University of Khartoum]]) - [[Hamadnallah Ahmed]], [[Yussuf Mustafa Al-Tini]], [[Yusuf Al-Mamoon]], and [[Babikir Mukhtar]] - decided to establish a sports club as an outlet for their and others' youthful energies.  On March 4th of 1930, a dozen of yet-to-be the founding fathers of Al-Hilal, mostly graduates from Khartoum Memorial College, met in the house of [[Hamadnallah Ahmed]] in [[Al-shohada]] Omdurman, to discuss the details of the new sports club.

At that time, sports clubs were named after neighbourhoods, cities and famous figures. Examples included [[Team Bori]] (after a Khartoum neighbourhood), [[Team Abbas]] (after a famous person) and [[Hay Alisbtaliya]] (after an Omdurmanian neighbourhood). The meeting concluded that the new club should have an inclusive name, and not be named after a specific neighbourhood or person.

The story goes that the club founders had been unable to agree upon a name for the proposed club when the meeting was temporarily adjourned at dusk for evening prayers at a nearby mosque.  After prayers and en route back to the meeting house, one of the founders, [[Adam Rajab]], is said to have looked up at the night sky, saw a crescent ("Hilal" in Arabic), and remarking that it was the crescent of the Muslim lunar month of [[Rajab]], asked the others "why not we name it Al-Hilal?". Everyone welcomed the idea, and on February 13th, 1930 Al-Hilal became the official name of the club and the first to hold this name in Sudan and the Middle East.  

The uniform chosen was dark blue and white - after the white crescent against the dark blue night skies.  In light of the aforementioned pro-Egyptian uprising, however, the British colonial authorities initially refused to permit formation of a team whose slogan, a crescent, was reminiscent of the crescent prominently featured on the Egyptian flag of that time.  Only after repeated reassurances that the team was simply an athletic outlet for apolitical college students, and that its slogan had no political overtones, did the British authorities relent and allow the team to form.

===1930 Squad and Officers ===

The first squad included many of the founders that were present at the establishing meeting. The following list includes the founding fathers of Al-Hilal and their roles.

==Motto==
The [[motto]] for Al-Hilal is '''''[[Allah]]- [[AlWatan]] - Al-Hilal'''''. It is translated to English as "God - The Nation - Al-Hilal", which establishes a priority love list for Al-Hilal fans.

==Rivalry with Al-Merrikh==
There is a fierce historical rivalry between the two strongest clubs in Sudan, Al-Hilal and [[Al-Merrikh]]. With both clubs based in Omdurman, clubs matches are very intensified and often require high security precautions. In recent years, this rivalry extended to include the press labeling certain sports newspapers and columnists as Al-Hilal Writers vs. Al-Merrikh Writers.
Players exchanges period is occasionally very competitive and fierce. Prospective players are sometimes hidden and placed in undisclosed locations to ensure that the other club would not extend a higher offer and sign the player.
Although [[Al-Mourada]] is considered as the third club that complete the [[Sudan football triplet]], it has struggled financially and administratively to continue that legacy. It was considered another local rival to Al-Hilal, however this has not been the case for the past 5 years.
