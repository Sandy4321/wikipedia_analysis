'''Higby Mountain''' or '''Mount Higby''' {{convert|892|ft}}, is a [[traprock]] mountain ridge located {{convert|3.75|mi}} east of [[Meriden, Connecticut]]. It is part of the narrow, linear [[Metacomet Ridge]] that extends from [[Long Island Sound]] near [[New Haven, Connecticut]], north through the [[Connecticut River Valley]] of [[Massachusetts]] to the [[Vermont]] border. Higby Mountain is known for its high cliff faces, unique [[microclimate]] ecosystems, and rare plant communities. It rises steeply {{convert|600|ft}} above the [[Quinnipiac River]] valley and the city of Meriden to the west as a continuous {{convert|2|mi|0|adj=on}} long ledge. The mountain is traversed by the {{convert|50|mi|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]].<ref name="F">Farnsworth, Elizabeth J. (2004).

==Geography==
Located within the towns of [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], and [[Middlefield, Connecticut|Middlefield]], Higby Mountain is {{convert|3|mi}} long by {{convert|1.2|mi}} wide at its widest point, although rugged topography makes the actual square mileage much larger. Higby Mountain is an important [[aquifer]]; two reservoirs and one pond lie at the base of it: ''Higby Mountain Reservoir'' at its east foot; ''Adder Reservoir,'' on the upper eastern slope; and ''Black Pond'' between Besek Mountain and Higby Mountain. The mountain forms a conspicuous, sharp {{convert|2|mi|0|adj=on}} long cliffline visible throughout the upper Quinnipiac River Valley and metropolitan Meriden. ''Camel's Hump'', est. {{convert|750|ft}}, also called ''The Pinnacle'' is a prominent southern high point on the ridge just above a shallow gap called ''Preston Notch''. (''The Pinnacle'' should not be confused with a similarly named peak on [[Talcott Mountain]], or with [[Pinnacle Rock (Connecticut)|Pinnacle Rock]] of [[Farmington, Connecticut]], both part of the Metacomet Ridge to the north of Higby Mountain). [[Interstate 91]] cuts through the gap between Higby Mountain and [[Chauncey Peak]] to the north.<ref name="D">''DeLorme Topo 6.0'' (2006). Mapping software. Yarmouth, Maine: [[DeLorme]].</ref>  
   
The Metacomet Ridge continues northwest from Higby Mountain as Chauncey Peak and south as [[Besek Mountain]]. A line of smaller hills extends from the Higby Mountain ridgeline north into Middletown; most notable of these is ''Fall Hill'' from which tumbles the {{convert|50|ft}} high ''Westfield Falls,'' visible from Interstate 91 just north of Higby Mountain. The north and east sides of Higby Mountain drain into Fall Brook, then Sawmill Brook, then the Mattabesett River, thence to the [[Connecticut River]] and Long Island Sound. The west and south side drain into Harbor Brook thence into the Quinnipiac River and Long Island Sound.<ref name="D"/>

==Geology and ecology==
Higby Mountain, like much of the Metacomet Ridge, is composed of [[basalt]], also called traprock, a [[volcanic]] rock. The mountain formed near the end of the [[Triassic Period]] with the [[rift (geology)|rifting]] apart of the [[North America]]n continent from [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]]. [[Lava]] welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[earthquake]] activity tilted the strata, creating the cliffs and ridgeline of Higby Mountain.<ref>Raymo, Chet and Maureen E. (1989). ''Written in Stone: A Geologic History of the Northeastern United States.'' Chester, Connecticut: Globe Pequot.</ref> Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt [[scree|talus]] produce a combination of [[microclimate]] ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut. Higby Mountain is also an important [[birds of prey|raptor]] migration path. (See [[Metacomet Ridge]] for more information on the geology and ecosystem of Higby Mountain).<ref name="F"/>

==Recreation and conservation==
Activities enjoyed on the mountain include [[hiking]], [[snowshoeing]], [[bird watching]] [[picnicking]], and other passive pursuits. [[Human swimming|Swimming]], [[boating]], and [[fishing]] are prohibited in the reservoirs but fishing and boating are allowed on Black Pond. The Mattabesett Trail (maintained by the [[Connecticut Forest and Park Association]]), which stretches from the northern end of [[Lamentation Mountain]], south to [[Totoket Mountain]] and north again to the Connecticut River, traverses the ridgeline of Higby Mountain. Higby Mountain has two trailheads. There is a roadside parking area at the south end of the mountain on the westbound side of [[Connecticut Route 66]], {{convert|1.5|mi}} east of [[Connecticut Route 15]] in Meriden. The second trailhead is located at the north end of the mountain at the junction of Miner Road and [[Interstate 91]], exit 20 in Middletown; parking is permitted along the road. Black Pond can be accessed via a small parking lot off East Main Street in Meriden, {{convert|1.2|mi}} east of [[Connecticut Route 15]].<ref name="C"/> 

[[The Nature Conservancy]] maintains a {{convert|158|acre}} reservation on the south ridgeline of Higby Mountain.<ref>[http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/connecticut/preserves/art5377.html "Higby Mountain Preserve"] [[The Nature Conservancy]], Retrieved December 21, 2007.</ref> The town of Middletown owns part of the mountain, both as open space and as watershed.<ref>[http://www.cityofmiddletown.com/ParksRec/parks_&_recreation.htm Town of Middletown Parks & Recreation] Retrieved December 21, 2007.</ref> Black Pond, undeveloped and scenic, is part of the Black Pond Wildlife Management Area.<ref name="C"/>  

Threats to the ecosystem and ridgeline of Higby Mountain include development and quarrying. In 2000, Higby Mountain was included in a study by the [[National Park Service]] for the designation of a new [[National Scenic Trail]] now tentatively called the [[New England National Scenic Trail]], which would include the [[Metacomet-Monadnock Trail]] in Massachusetts and the [[Mattabesett Trail]] and [[Metacomet Trail]] trails in Connecticut.<ref name="F"/><ref>[http://www.mmmtrail.org/DocsForLinks/MMMExecSummary.pdf "Monadnock, Metacomet, Mattabesett National Scenic Trail Study".] [[United States National Park Service]].

The Meriden Land Trust [http://www.meridenlandtrust.com/ Meriden Land Trust] and the  [http://www.middlesexlandtrust.org/preserves.htm Middlesex Land Trust] have been active in conserving the [[viewshed]] of Higby Mountain.
