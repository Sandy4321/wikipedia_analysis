'''John Whiteside Parsons''' (born '''Marvel Whiteside Parsons'''; October 2, 1914 <U+2013> June 17, 1952), better known as '''Jack Parsons''', was an American [[aerospace engineering|rocket propulsion engineering]] researcher, [[chemist]], and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] [[occultism|occultist]]. A pioneer in [[solid-fuel rocket]] research and development, he was affiliated with the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), and was one of the principal founders of both the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and the [[Aerojet|Aerojet Engineering Corporation]].

Born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and raised into a wealthy family in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[science fiction]] literature inspired Parsons' early interest in rocketry. Dropping out of [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]] and [[Stanford University]] due to financial difficulties in the [[Great Depression]], with school friend [[Edward Forman]] he began experimenting with rocket design. In 1934, they united with graduate student [[Frank Malina]] to form the Caltech-affiliated GALCIT Rocket Research Group, supported by [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] chairman [[Theodore von K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n]]. In 1939 they gained funding from the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to work on [[JATO|Jet-Assisted Take Off]] (JATO) for the U.S. military, renaming themselves the JPL. In 1942, they founded the Aerojet Engineering Corporation to develop and sell their JATO technology.

After a brief involvement in [[Marxism]], in 1939 Parsons converted to the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[new religious movement]], Thelema, and joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the Thelemite [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO). At Crowley's bidding, Parsons took over the position of lodge leader from [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] in 1942, operating it from his manor home<U+2014>nicknamed "the Parsonage"<U+2014>in [[Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena)|Orange Grove Boulevard]], Pasadena. With [[L. Ron Hubbard]] he began the [[Babalon Working]], designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess [[Babalon]] to Earth, continuing the procedure with his wife [[Marjorie Cameron]]. After Hubbard stole his life savings, Parsons sold the Parsonage and went through various menial jobs. Due to the developing climate of [[McCarthyism]], he lost his security clearance and was left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons died in an explosion at his home; police ruled it an accidental death, but a number of his associates<U+2014>including Cameron<U+2014>suspected suicide or murder.

Parsons' death attracted national attention, and his occult and [[Individualism|individualist]] writings were posthumously published. Parsons is widely recognized by Thelemites and occult researchers as one of the most significant figures in propagating the religion across North America, and in the [[scientific community]] for his contributions to rocket propulsion chemistry and design, along with his role as an early advocate of their utilization for [[space exploration]] and [[human spaceflight]]. He is the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1914<U+2013>1934===
Marvel "Jack" Whiteside Parsons was born on 2 October 1914 at the [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=1|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=26}} His parents, Ruth Virginia Whiteside (''c.''1893<U+2013>1952) and Marvel H. Parsons (''c''.1894<U+2013>1947), had moved to [[California]] from [[Massachusetts]] the previous year, purchasing a house at 2375 Scarf Street in downtown Los Angeles.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=1|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=21<U+2013>25}}
Their marriage broke down soon after Jack's birth, when Ruth discovered that her husband had been having extramarital sex with a prostitute; she filed for divorce in March 1915, and he returned to Massachusetts after being publicly exposed as an adulterer, with Ruth forbidding him from having any contact with his son.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=1<U+2013>2|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=26<U+2013>27}} Although she retained her ex-husband's surname, Ruth ceased to call her son "Marvel", instead referring to him as "John", whereas many other friends throughout his life knew him as "Jack".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=2}} Ruth's parents Walter and Carrie Whiteside moved to California to be with Jack and their daughter, using their wealth to purchase an up-market house at 537 South Orange Grove Avenue in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]<U+2014>known locally as "Millionaire's Mile"<U+2014>where they could all live together.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=2<U+2013>3|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=28}} Here, Jack was surrounded by domestic servants and soon became spoiled.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=33<U+2013>40}} Having few friends, he lived a solitary childhood, and spent much time reading, taking a particular interest in works of mythology, [[Arthurian legend]], and the ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=33<U+2013>40}} Through the work of [[Jules Verne]] he became interested in [[science fiction]], and became a keen reader of [[pulp magazine]]s like ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=33<U+2013>40}} It was this interest in science fiction that led to the development of his early interest in [[rocket]]ry.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=42<U+2013>43}}

[[File:HPR-Flight.jpg|thumb|right|Parsons developed an early passion for rocketry]]
Aged twelve, Parsons began attending Washington Junior High School, where he performed poorly<U+2014>something biographer [[George Pendle]] attributed to undiagnosed [[dyslexia]]<U+2014>and was heavily bullied for his perceived effeminacy.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=4<U+2013>5|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=44<U+2013>47}} Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward "Ed" Forman, an individual from a poor working class family who shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=4<U+2013>5|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=44<U+2013>47}} Parsons had begun to investigate [[occultism]], and independently performed a ritual intended to invoke [[the Devil]] into his bedroom; he was so scared by the event that he ceased such activities for a number of years.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=4|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=46}} Due to his poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in [[San Diego]], the Brown Military Academy for Boys. Here, he was expelled for blowing up the toilets, returning to Washington Junior High.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=47}}

With his family, Parsons spent summer 1929 on a tour of Europe before returning to Pasadena, where the family moved into 285 North San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]] their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Parsons' grandfather Walter died.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=5|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=56<U+2013>57}} After graduating from high school in 1931, Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching; here Parsons flourished, becoming editor of the school's newspaper ''El Universitano'', winning an award for literary excellence, and focusing his attentions on the study of chemistry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=57<U+2013>59}} With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the [[Hercules Powder Company]], where he was able to learn more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=59<U+2013>60}} Independently, he and Forman continued to explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that he had stolen from work.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=60<U+2013>61}} Parsons also underwent a brief correspondence with the German rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]]; Pendle attributes its sudden dissipation to their mutual reticence about disclosing the technical details of their discoveries.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=54<U+2013>55}}

Graduating from University School in the summer of 1933, Parsons moved with his mother and grandmother to a more modest house at 620 St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in classical literature and writing poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=61}} In the autumn he enrolled in [[Pasadena Junior College]] to study physics and chemistry, but was forced to drop out after only a term due to his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=61}} His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in [[Pinole]], [[San Francisco Bay]], where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month, but he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to [[nitroglycerine]]. He saved up in the hope of continuing his academic studies, and began a degree in chemistry at [[Stanford University]], but nevertheless still found it too expensive, returning to Pasadena.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=62<U+2013>64}}

===Marriage and the GALCIT Rocket Research Group: 1934<U+2013>1938===
In the hope of gaining access to the resources of the nearby [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) for their rocketry programs, Parsons and Forman approached Caltech's [[William Bollay]], who redirected them to a graduate student named [[Frank Malina]] who shared their interests and who soon befriended Parsons.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=8<U+2013>9|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=74<U+2013>76}} Together Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech, although did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. Caltech's [[Clark Millikan]] immediately rebuffed them, although [[Theodore von K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n]] saw more promise in their proposal, and agreed to allow them to operate under the auspices of the university's [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] (GALCIT). Naming themselves "The GALCIT Rocket Research Group", they gained access to the university's specialist equipment, although due to the Great Depression von K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n was unable to finance them.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=77<U+2013>83}} Sharing [[socialism|socialist]] values, they operated on an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] basis, with Malina teaching the others about scientific procedure and they teaching him about the practical elements of rocketry; they often socialized together, drinking alcohol and smoking [[marijuana]], while Malina and Parsons set about writing a novel<U+2014>never finished<U+2014>with strong [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=22<U+2013>24|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=90<U+2013>93, 118<U+2013>120}}

[[File:P1-RocketBoys.jpg|thumb|left|300px|GALCIT Group members in the Arroyo Seco, November 1936. Left foreground to right: Rudolph Schott, Amo Smith, Frank Malina, Ed Forman, and Jack Parsons]]
Parsons had met a woman named Helen Northup at a local church dance, and proposed marriage in July 1934. She accepted, and they were married in April 1935 at the Little Church of the Flowers in Forest Lane Memorial Park, [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], before undertaking a brief honeymoon in San Diego.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=84<U+2013>89}} Together they moved into a house at 168 South Terrace Drive, Pasadena, while Parsons gained employment for the explosives manufacturer Halifax Powder Company at their facility in [[Saugus]]; much to Helen's dismay, Parsons spent most of his wage on funding the GALCIT Rocket Research Group.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=89}} Funding his research, at one point he pawned Helen's engagement ring, and would often ask her family for loans.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=105<U+2013>106}}
At one point, Parsons received a visit from his estranged father, who had become a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the coast artillery corps, remarried, and had another son named Charles, whom he brought to visit Parsons. The meeting had little impact on Parsons, who would only meet his father once more before his death.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=103<U+2013>105}}

The Group contacted rocket scientist [[Robert H. Goddard]], and although he invited Marina to his facility, he was not interested in cooperating.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=12|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=96<U+2013>98}} They were instead joined by Caltech masters students, [[Apollo M. O. Smith]] (known as "Amo") and Rudolph Schott, with Schott being relied upon for the use of his pickup truck as means of transporting equipment. Another recruit, Carlos C. Wood, was a local resident who had taken an interest in the Group's work and offered his assistance.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=12|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=99}} Their first motor test took place at Halloween 1936 near the Devil's Gate Dam in the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]], and although the motor exploded, they learned much from the experiment.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=15|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=98<U+2013>103}} They continued their experiments throughout the fall of 1936, and after the fourth test was successfully completed, K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n agreed that they could perform their future experiments on campus.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=103}}

In April 1937 they were joined by a Caltech mathematician from China, [[Qian Xuesen]], and several months later were also joined by a Caltech laboratory assistant, Weld Arnold, who worked as the group's official photographer.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=106<U+2013>107}} Although some Caltech scientists continued to deride them for their work on rocketry, a field still stigmatized by its association with science fiction, they became well known on campus, earning the moniker of the "Suicide Squad" for the dangerous nature of some of their experiments, also attracting attention from the local press.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=17<U+2013>18|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=108<U+2013>111}} Parsons himself gained further media publicity when he appeared as an expert explosives witness in the trial of Earl Kynette, the head of police intelligence in Los Angeles who was accused of rigging a bomb to kill private investigator Harry Raymond. When Kynette was convicted largely on Parsons' testimony, his identity as an expert scientist in the public eye was established, despite his lack of a university education.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=26<U+2013>28|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=114<U+2013>116}}

In May 1938, Parsons was invited by Forrest Ackerman to lecture at the Los Angeles Chapter Number 4 of the Science Fiction League (LASFL), and although he never joined the group he did occasionally attend their talks.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=57<U+2013>60|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=126<U+2013>127}} Another scientist to become involved in the GALCIT project was [[Sidney Weinbaum]], a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal [[Marxism|Marxist]]; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in creating a largely secretive [[communism|communist]] discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the ''[[People's Daily World]]'' and joined the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], he refused to join the [[American Communist Party]], resulting in a break down between his and Weinbaum's friendship.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=120<U+2013>123}} This ideological divide coupled with the need to focus on paid employment led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group by 1938, leaving only its three founding members remaining.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=130}}

===Embracing Thelema and JATO: 1939<U+2013>1942===
[[File:Aleister Crowley, wickedest man in the world.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleister Crowley (pictured in 1912), founder of Thelema, was Parsons' spiritual mentor]]
In January 1939, John and Frances Baxter, a brother and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema in Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he witnessed the performance of a [[Gnostic Mass]]. Parsons was intrigued, having already heard of Thelema's founder [[Aleister Crowley]] after reading a copy of Crowley's ''Konx Om Pax'' (1907). An attendee of the Church was Hollywood actor [[John Carradine]], who read a poem by Crowley at its opening in 1935.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=88}} At the mass Parsons was introduced to leading members Regina Kahl, [[Jane Wolfe]], and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]]. Feeling both "repulsion and attraction" for Smith, Parsons continued to attend the Church's events sporadically for a year.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=257<U+2013>258|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=33<U+2013>36|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=133<U+2013>136}} He continued to read Crowley's works, which increasingly interested him, and encouraged Helen to do so too.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=152}} Parsons came to believe in the reality of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] as a force that could be explained through [[quantum physics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=152}} He tried to interest a number of his friends and acquaintances in Thelema, at one point taking the science fiction authors [[Jack Williamson]] and [[Cleve Cartmill]] to a performance of the Gnostic Mass, and although they were unimpressed, Parsons was successful with a young Caltech student whom he had befriended, [[Grady Louis McMurtry]], as well as McMurtry's fiancee Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister [[Sara Northrup]].{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=266|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=41|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=169<U+2013>172|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=513}}

Parsons and his wife would finally be initiated into the Agape Lodge of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] on February 15, 1941, with Parsons adopting the Thelemic motto of "Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae", a Latin mistranslation of "The establishment of Thelema through the rituals of love". The initials of this motto spelled out TOPAN, also serving as the declaration "To Pan."{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=263|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=56|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3p=172}} Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley remarked that "the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding."{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=263}} Smith wrote to Crowley, claiming that Parsons was "a really excellent man&nbsp;... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself&nbsp;... JP is going to be very valuable",{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=172}} while Wolfe wrote to the Thelemite [[Karl Germer]] to comment that Parsons was "an A1 man&nbsp;... Crowleyesque in attainment as a matter of fact."{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=173}} Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons "is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!"{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=263}}

[[File:First JATO assisted Flight - GPN-2000-001538.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Take-off on August 12, 1941 of America's first "rocket-assisted" fixed-wing aircraft, an Ercoupe fitted with a GALCIT developed solid propellant JATO booster]]

At K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n's suggestion, Malina had approached the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research into what they now termed "jet propulsion". The military were interested in jet propulsion as a means of getting aircraft off the ground quickly where there was no room for a runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of [[JATO|Jet-Assisted Take Off]] (JATO) by June 1939. In this way they became the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group in history.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=31<U+2013>322|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=156<U+2013>158}} Although a quarter of this funding went on repairing damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, they submitted their June report, at which they showed the feasibility of the project and requested $100,000 to continue, although only received $22,000.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=32<U+2013>33, 48|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=158<U+2013>166}}  Now calling themselves "GALCIT Project Number 1", they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, where Parsons focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=158<U+2013>166}}

They were joined by Caltech mathematician [[Martin Summerfield]], and 18 workers supplied by the [[Works Progress Administration]], although former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=166<U+2013>167}} The FBI were satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist, although were concerned when a Thelemite friend, Paul Seckler, used Parsons' gun in a drunken car jacking, for which he was imprisoned in [[San Quentin State Prison]] for two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=70<U+2013>71|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=186<U+2013>187}} The first tests took place in August 1941, with Homer Bousley piloting a JATO-equipped [[Ercoupe]] plane at the March Fields Air Corps Base in [[Moreno Valley]]; watched by such figures as Clark Millikan and [[William F. Durand]], it proved a success.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=65<U+2013>66|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=177<U+2013>184}} Over the following weeks, 62 further tests took place, with the NAS increasing their grant to $125,000.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=184<U+2013>185}} The military ordered a flight test using liquid fuel <U+2013> rather than the pre-existing solid fuel <U+2013> by the Spring of 1942. Parsons and his team focused on the task, and although many of the proposed liquid formulas proved too dangerous, Malina solved the problem by replacing [[gasoline]] as an ingredient with [[aniline]], resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped [[A-20A]] plane at the Mura Auxiliary Air Field in the [[Mojave Desert]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=72|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=189<U+2013>191}}

===The Aerojet Engineering Corporation: 1942<U+2013>1944===
With the U.S. having joined the [[Second World War]], the group agreed to produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the air corps. To do so, they formed a company in March 1942, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, into which Parsons, Forman, Malina, K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n, and Summerfield each invested $250, opening their office on East Colorado Street.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=73<U+2013>75|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=191<U+2013>192}} They soon brought Apollo Smith in as their engineer, while Parsons worked on a way of replacing the unstable black powder in the rockets, eventually discovering the use of [[asphalt]] as an appropriate alternative.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=72|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=196<U+2013>199}} The air corps soon requested 2000 JATOs by late 1943.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=224}} Nevertheless, the company operated on a hand-to-mouth basis, and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project, with Caltech's [[Fritz Zwicky]] being brought in as head of the company's research department.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=76|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=223<U+2013>226}} His new credentials gave Parsons the opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S., meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with [[Karl Germer]], the head of the OTO in North America, and in [[Washington D.C.]] met [[Joseph Auslander]], donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the [[Library of Congress]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=198, 203}} He also became a regular at the [[Ma<U+00F1>ana Literary Society]], which met at the home of Parsons' friend [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in [[Laurel Canyon]]. Here, he associated with such science fiction writers as [[Cleve Cartmill]], [[Jack Williamson]], and [[Anthony Boucher]], the latter of whom would use Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in ''Rocket to the Morgue''.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=228<U+2013>230}} Parsons also attended lectures at the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]], where on one occasion he met a young [[Ray Bradbury]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=60}}

In June 1941, Helen went away for a period, during which Parsons began a sexual relationship with her sister, Sara Northrup, encouraged to do so by the sexually permissive attitude of the OTO. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=274|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=93<U+2013>94|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=203<U+2013>205|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=537}} Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Talbot Smith, entering into a relationship with him that would last for the rest of his life; nevertheless the four remained friends.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=274|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=203<U+2013>205}} Together the two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites, relocated from Winona Boulevard to a large [[Craftsman style|Craftsman-style]] house at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month, and lived communally in what became the new base of the Agape Lodge.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=271<U+2013>273, 276|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=83<U+2013>84|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=207<U+2013>210|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=521}} Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the [[Stele of Revealing]], a statue of the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and his collection of swords and daggers, which he hung on the walls, while he also converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=84|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=209<U+2013>210}} Although there were many arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema, giving almost all of his salary to the OTO and actively seeking out new members, among whom was Forman.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=212<U+2013>213}} He invited many of his colleagues to the lodge parties, but soon the group came under investigation by both the Pasadena police department and the FBI, who had received allegations of [[black magic]] and sexual orgies; nevertheless, both found no evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the lodge constituted no threat to national security.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=283<U+2013>285|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=87<U+2013>88|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=214<U+2013>215|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=525}} Having long made heavy use of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]] as well,{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=216}} and continued to have sexual relations with a large number of women, including McMurtry's fiancee Claire. When Parsons paid for Claire to have an [[abortion]], McMurtry was angered, and their friendship broke down.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=215}}

Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith removed as head of the Agape Lodge, believing that he had become a bad influence on other lodge members; Parsons and Helen wrote to them to defend their mentor, but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down, with Parsons appointed temporary head of the lodge.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=278, 280<U+2013>282|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=216<U+2013>217, 220|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=524<U+2013>525}} Parsons soon created a Thelemite journal, ''Oriflamme'', in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressed and the project was soon shelved.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|pp=217<U+2013>219}} In April, Helen gave birth to Smith's son, who was given Parsons' surname, being named Kwan Lanval Parsons.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=88|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3p=221}} In May, Smith and Helen left for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley with their baby, where Smith undertook his magical retirement.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=290<U+2013>291|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=92<U+2013>93|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=221<U+2013>222}} Back in England, Crowley undertook an [[astrology|astrological]] analysis of Smith's birth chart, and came to the conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him; Smith however remained skeptical.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=294<U+2013>298|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=90<U+2013>91|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=221<U+2013>222}} Refusing to take orders from Germer anymore, Smith resigned from the OTO, while Parsons <U+2013> who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict <U+2013> ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head, a resignation that Crowley refused to accept.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=299<U+2013>300|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=222<U+2013>223}} As the U.S. became aware that Nazi Germany had developed the [[V-2]] rocket, they placed a renewed impetus on their own rocket research, reinstating Qian to the GALCIT project. They gave the group a $3 million grant to develop rocket-based weapons, with the group being expanded and renamed the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=96<U+2013>97|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=231<U+2013>233}} By this point, the U.S. Navy were ordering 20,000 JATOs a month from Aerojet, and to cope with the increased demand, in December 1944 the company sold 51% of its stock to the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]], with Parsons selling all of his stock for $11,000.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=100|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=239<U+2013>240}} With this money, he would buy the lease to 1003, which had come to be known as "the Parsonage" after him.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=241}}

===L. Ron Hubbard and the Babalon Working: 1945<U+2013>1946===
Now disassociated from Aerojet, Parsons and Forman founded the Ad Astra Engineering Company.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=101|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=242}} He continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although asked for a divorce from the latter, and ignored Crowley's commands by welcoming Smith back to 1003 when he had finished his retreat.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=248<U+2013>249}} Parsons continued to hold OTO activities at 1003, but began renting rooms at the house to non-Thelemites such as journalist [[Nieson Himmel]], physicist [[Robert Cornog]], and science fiction artist [[Louis Goldstone]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=243<U+2013>246}} Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. As Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled in a 1962 article: "In the ads placed in local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, [[Atheism|atheists]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]], or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms<U+2014>any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=86}}

Soon, science fiction writer [[L. Ron Hubbard]] moved in to 1003; he and Parsons became close friends, with the latter informing Crowley that Hubbard was "the most Thelemic person I have ever met."{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=101<U+2013>102|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=252<U+2013>255}} Although Parsons and Sara had always had an [[open relationship]], she became enamored with Hubbard, causing Parsons intense jealousy.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=102|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=256|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=537<U+2013>538}} Parsons began to devote increasing amounts of time to the 'dark side' of magic, becoming interested in the iconography of [[witchcraft]], something that concerned many fellow OTO members, who believed that he had invoked troublesome spirits into the Parsonage.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=257<U+2013>258}} Deciding to use magical means to attract a new lover, Parsons performed a series of rituals based in [[Enochian magic]] during which he masturbated on to magical tablets, accompanied by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)|Second Violin Concerto]]. He allowed Hubbard to take part, believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=107<U+2013>108, 116<U+2013>117, 119<U+2013>128|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=259<U+2013>260}}

[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|thumb|left|Parsons befriended L. Ron Hubbard (pictured)]]
Their final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert on 18 January 1946, and on return to the Parsonage Parsons discovered that a woman named [[Marjorie Cameron|Marjorie "Candy" Cameron]] had come to visit. Believing her to be the "[[elemental]] woman" that he had invoked, he began performing [[sex magic]] rituals with her. Describing this as the [[Babalon Working]], he hoped to bring about the incarnation of a Thelemite female messiah, [[Babalon]], onto Earth, with Cameron acting as the "[[Babalon#Office of the Scarlet Woman|Scarlet Woman]]" in these rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=130<U+2013>132|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=263<U+2013>264|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=29, 35<U+2013>37}} Although Crowley warned him of such an endeavor, Parsons was committed, and retreated to the desert, where he came to believe that a preternatural entity spoke to him, to provide him with ''Liber 49'', which he believed to represent a fourth part of ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the ''Book of Babalon''.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=132<U+2013>148, 150|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=264<U+2013>265|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=538}} This accomplished, Parsons set about trying to sell the 1003 for $25,000, on the condition that he could continue to live in the coach house, and he appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=150|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=266<U+2013>267}}

Parsons decided to co-found a company with Hubbard and Sara, Allied Enterprises, in which he invested his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money, he and Sara travel to [[Miami]], there to purchase three yachts that they would then sail through the [[Panama Canal]] and to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends thought it a bad idea. When Crowley informed him that it was an obvious [[confidence trick]], Parsons changed his mind and flew to Miami, where he placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Discovering this, Hubbard attempted to flee about his yacht, but hit a squall and was forced to return to port. Here, Allied Enterprises was dissolved, and in a court settlement Hubbard was made to promise to pay Parsons back. Hubbard and Sara subsequently married, while he went on to found [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=155<U+2013>157|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=267<U+2013>269, 272<U+2013>273|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=538<U+2013>539}} Returning to California, Parsons completed the sale of the Parsonage, which was then demolished, and resigned from the OTO, commenting in his letter to Crowley that he did not believe that "as an autocratic organization, [the OTO] constitutes a true and proper medium for the expression and attainment" of the Thelemic rites of humanity.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=158|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=270|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=555}}

===Final years: 1946<U+2013>1952===
[[File:Navaho launch.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Parsons worked on developing the [[SM-64 Navaho]] missile (pictured being launched in 1957)]]
Parsons obtained employment with [[North American Aviation]] at [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], where he worked on the [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho Missile Program]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=158<U+2013>159|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=275}} With Cameron he moved into a house on [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], where he began to teach her more about occultism.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=275}}  Four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, they were married on October 19, 1946, with Forman as their witness.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=158|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=277|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=39}} Parsons continued to be seen as a specialist in rocketry, in March 1947 being called as an expert in a police investigation regarding an industrial explosion, and in May 1947 giving a talk at the [[Pacific Rocket Society]] at which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=159|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=277<U+2013>278}} Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct OTO and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley up until the latter's death in December 1947.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=277, 279}}

At the emergence of the [[Cold War]], a [[Red Scare]] developed in the U.S. as the Congressional [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] began investigating anyone with perceived communist sympathies. Many of Parsons' former colleagues lost their security clearance and jobs as a result, and eventually the FBI also stripped Parsons of his clearance, leaving him unemployed.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=159|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=281<U+2013>283|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=46<U+2013>47}} He managed to earn a wage as a car mechanic and as a manual laborer at a gas station, also briefly working at the [[University of Southern California]]'s Department of Pharmacology.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=161, 166|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=284}} Relations had been strained between him and Cameron, and they agreed to a temporary separation; she moved to Mexico to join an artists' commune in [[San Miguel de Allende]].{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=283|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=48, 51<U+2013>52}}

Parsons claimed he was called on by Babalon at Halloween 1948 to continue his occult works alone; he embarked on sex magical operations with various prostitutes, intent on performing "the Crossing of the Abyss", thereby attaining union with the universal consciousness and becoming "the Master of the Temple."{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=160<U+2013>169|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=284<U+2013>285}} Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted of having had an [[out-of-body experience]] invoked by Babalon, who [[Astral projection|astrally]] transported him to the biblical [[Chorazin|City of Chorazin]]. Part of Parsons' "Oath of the Abyss" was an "Oath of the [[Antichrist|AntiChrist]]", witnessed by W.T. Smith, in which he professed to embody an entity named ''Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal'', "who am come [sic] to fulfill the law of the Beast 666 [Aleister Crowley]." This name being a composite of alternate spellings referring to the Judeo-Christian demon [[Belial]], and the [[false messiah]]s of Jewish and Islamic [[eschatology]], [[Armilus]] and the [[Masih ad-Dajjal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=160<U+2013>169|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=284<U+2013>285}} Viewing these oaths as the completion of the Babalon Working, he authored an autobiography titled ''Analysis by a Master of the Temple'' and an occult text termed ''The Book of AntiChrist''. In the latter work, Parsons (communicating as Belarion) prophesied that in seven years<U+2014>on the condition that he lived<U+2014>Babalon would manifest on Earth, superseding the Abrahamic religions and converting the United States and world to Thelema. Reinforcing his protestations about the Ordo Templi Orientis, Parsons describes the OTO as "an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema."{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=160<U+2013>169|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=284<U+2013>285}} During this period, Parsons also authored an essay on his individualist philosophy and politics, "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword".{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=160<U+2013>169|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=284<U+2013>285}} None of these works saw publication in his lifetime. He entered a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan, and together they moved to 1200 Esplanade on [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], a building known among them as the "Concrete Castle."{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=171|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=288|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=51<U+2013>53}}

Through his connections, Parsons was able to have his security clearance reinstated by the [[Industrial Employment Review Board]], who ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=161|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=286}} Karman put him in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the [[American Technion Society]], a group dedicated to supporting the fledgling state of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons a job with the Israeli rocket program, and hired him to produce a number of reports for them.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=169<U+2013>170|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=286<U+2013>287}} As the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel, but the FBI accused him of espionage on the basis of some of the reports that he had submitted to the Technion Society. In October 1951, the U.S. attorney decided however that the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets and that therefore Parsons was not guilty.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=170<U+2013>172|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=291<U+2013>293, 296|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=54<U+2013>55}}

The Review Board nevertheless still considered him a liability, and in January 1952 reinstated their ban on him working for classified projects, effectively preventing him from working in the jet industry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=172|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=296|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=63<U+2013>64}} In May 1951 he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company based in North Hollywood, and also began work at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus, where he created pyrotechnics and explosives for the movie industry.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=177|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=294, 297|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=57}} Cameron had returned to him, and reinstating their relationship, they moved to a former coach house at 1071 South Orange Grove in Pasadena.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=169|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=293|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=57}} They began holding parties once more that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the [[Beat Generation]],{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1pp=294<U+2013>295|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=57<U+2013>63}} while he also founded a new Thelemite group known as "The Witchcraft" whose beliefs revolved around his Babalon prophecies.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=99|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=295}}

===Death: 1952===
Parsons and Cameron had decided to travel to Mexico for a few months.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=179|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=296<U+2013>297|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=64}} On the day before they planned to leave, June 17, 1952, he received a rush order of explosives for a film set, and he began work on it at his house.{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=299|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2p=65}} In the midst of this project an explosion destroyed the building, during which Parsons sustained fatal wounds including an amputated right forearm, a broken left arm, both legs broken, and a "gaping hole" in his jaw. Despite these critical injuries, Parsons was found conscious and groaning in pain by upstairs neighbors. He was able to communicate with arriving emergency services, who rushed him to the Huntingdon Memorial Hospital, where he was declared dead around 37 minutes after the explosion.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=177<U+2013>178|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=1<U+2013>6|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3pp=65<U+2013>66}} When his mother was informed of the events, she immediately committed suicide by overdosing on [[barbiturates]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=178<U+2013>179|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=6<U+2013>7|3a1=Kansa|3y=2011|3p=66}} Don Harding, a criminologist with the Pasadena police force, led the official investigation, concluding that Parsons had been mixing [[fulminate of mercury]] in a coffee can when he dropped it to the floor, resulting in the initial explosion which worsened when it came into contact with the many other chemicals in the room.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=179<U+2013>181|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=8}} Forman considered this likely, highlighting that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=301}} A number of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, noting that he was very cautious about safety, but the police nevertheless closed the case.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=181|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=11<U+2013>12}} Both Wolfe and Smith suggested that Parsons' death had been suicide, noting that he had suffered from depression for some time.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=327|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=13, 301}} Cameron became convinced that he had been murdered, either by police officers who wanted vengeance for his role in the conviction of Earl Kynette, or by [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionists]] opposed to his work with the Israeli authorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=185|2a1=Kansa|2y=2011|2pp=77<U+2013>79}} One of Cameron's friends, the artist [[Renate Druks]], later stated her belief that Parsons had died in a rite designed to create a [[homunculus]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=184}} His death would never be definitively explained.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=xxv}}

The immediate aftermath of the explosion attracted the interest of the U.S. media, making headline news in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''; these initial reports focused on his prominence in rocketry, but neglected to mention his occult interests. However, within several days, journalists had discovered his involvement in Thelema and the Agape Lodge, and made this the emphasis of their reports.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1pp=182, 185<U+2013>187|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=7<U+2013>10}} Parsons' body was cremated, and Cameron scattered the ashes in the Mojave Desert,{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=300}} before burning most of his possessions.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=303}} She would later attempt to perform [[astral projection]] to commune with him.{{sfn|Kansa|2011|pp=77<U+2013>79}} There was no funeral, although the OTO held a memorial service at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=327|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=300}} Cameron continued her work in art, acting and occultism until her death in 1995, notably portraying Babalon (as "The Scarlet Woman") and Hindu goddess [[Kali]] in Thelemite [[Kenneth Anger]]'s short film ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]'' (1954).

Although considered effeminate as a child, in adult life Parsons was known to exhibit an attitude of [[machismo]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=176}} His FBI file described him as "potentially bisexual",{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=56}} and his biographer John Carter noted that he "once expressed a latent homosexuality" although also accepted that the impression of bisexuality given by Parsons may have been erroneous.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=56}} He nevertheless gained the reputation of being a womanizer, and enjoyed sexual relationships with many women,{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=88}} although never wanted children, practicing [[coitus interruptus]] to prevent it.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=212}} Aside from rocketry, a key hobby of Parsons' was hunting jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=176}} He also enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating explosives such as [[firecrackers]] and [[smoke bombs]],{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=226}} and was also known to spend hours at a time in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=242}}

=== Religious beliefs ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="No philosophy, theory, religion, or system of thought can be absolute and infallible. They are relative only. One man's opinion is just as good as another's."|source=Jack Parsons{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p=21}}
}}
[[Image:Crowley unicursal hexagram.svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[unicursal hexagram]] is the symbol of Thelema]]
Parsons adhered to the occult philosophy of [[Thelema]], which had been founded in 1904 by the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] following a spiritual revelation that he had in the city of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], when<U+2014>according to Crowley's own accounts<U+2014>a spirit being known as [[Aiwass]] dictated to him a prophetic text known as ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfn|Beta|2008|pp=x-xi}}

On July 31, 1945, he gave a speech to the Agape Lodge in which he attempted to explain how he felt that ''The Book of the Law'' could be made relevant to "modern life." In this, which was subsequently published under the title of "Doing your Will", he examined the Thelemite concept of [[True Will]], writing that:

:The mainspring of an individual is his creative Will. This Will is the sum of his tendencies, his destiny, his inner truth. It is one with the force that makes the birds sing and flowers bloom; as inevitable as [[gravity]], as implicit as a bowel movement, it informs alike [[atoms]] and men and suns.
:To the man who knows this Will, there is no why or why not, no can or cannot; he IS!
:There is no known force that can turn an apple into an alley cat; there is no known force that can turn a man from his Will. This is the triumph of genius; that, surviving the centuries, enlightens the world.
:This force burns in every man.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p=67}}

He identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with [[fear]]: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that "The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress."{{sfn|Parsons|2008|pp=69<U+2013>71}}

=== Politics ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="[Parsons] had witnessed the blinding overnight successes achieved by the government-by-terror [[totalitarianism]] of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] Russia and [[Nazi Germany]]. He had the foresight to see that [the United States of] America, once armed with the new powers of total destruction and surveillance that were sure to follow the swelling flood of new technologies, had the potential to become even more repressive unless its founding principles of individual liberty were religiously preserved and its leaders held accountable to them.
<br />
Two of the keys to redressing the balance were the freedom of women and an end to the state control of individual sexual expression. He knew that these potent forces, embodied as they are in a majority of the world's population, had the power, once unleashed, to change the world."|source=[[William Breeze]] (Hymenaeus Beta), current Frater Superior of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].{{sfn|Beta|2008|p=xi}} }}
From early on in his career, Parsons took an interest in [[socialism]] and [[communism]],{{sfn|Beta|2008|p=ix}} views that he shared with his friend Malina.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=90<U+2013>93}} Under the influence of another friend, Sidney Weinbaum, the two of them joined a communist group in the late 1930s, with Parsons reading [[Marxism|Marxist]] literature, but he remained unconvinced and refused to join the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]].{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp=120<U+2013>123}} Malina asserted that this was because Parsons was a "political romantic," whose attitude was more anti-authoritarian than anti-capitalist.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=122}} Parsons would later become critical of the [[Marxism<U+2013>Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] government of the [[Soviet Union]], sarcastically commenting, "The [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is merely temporary<U+2014>the state will eventually wither away like a snark hunter, leaving us all free as birds. Meanwhile it may be necessary to kill, torture and imprison a few million people, but whose fault is it if they get in the way of progress?"{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p=11}} During the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Red Scare]] in the early 1950s, he was questioned as to his former links to the communist movement, by which time he denied any connection to it, instead describing himself as "an [[Individualism|individualist]]."{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=293}}

Influenced by Thelema, which holds to the ethical code of "[[Do what thou wilt]]," in the 1940s Parsons became a vocal social [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. In his article, ''Freedom is a Lonely Star'', he championed the libertarian social views of some of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], which were enshrined in the [[United States Constitution|American Constitution]], claiming that by his own time these had been "sold out by America, and for that reason the heart of America is sick and the soul of America is dead."{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p=4}} He proceeded to criticize many aspects of contemporary U.S. society, particularly the police force, remarking, "The police mind is usually of a sadistic and homicidal trend" and noting that they carried out the "ruthless punishment of symbolic scapegoats" such as African-Americans, prostitutes, alcoholics, homeless people and socio-political radicals, under the pretense of a country that had "liberty and justice for all."{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p=9}} To bring about a freer future, Parsons believed in [[Sexual revolution|liberalizing attitudes to sexual morality]], stating that in his belief, the publication of the [[Kinsey report]] and development of the [[Psychonautics|psychonautical]] sciences had as significant an influence on Western society as the creation of the [[atomic bomb]] and the development of [[nuclear physics]], and that in the future the restrictions on sexual morality within society should be abolished in order to bring about greater freedom and individuality.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|p=13}} In this context, Colin Bennett of the ''[[Fortean Times]]'' cites Parsons as one of the instigators of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural movements of the 1960s]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.forteantimes.com/features/profiles/507/john_whiteside_parsons.html |title=John Whiteside Parsons |author=Bennett, Colin |work=Fortean Times |date=March 2000 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>

[[Robert Anton Wilson]] described Parsons as an "ultra-individualist" who exhibited a "genuine sympathy for working people," strongly empathized with [[feminism]] and held an antipathy toward [[patriarchy]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=x}} Parsons was also a [[Zionism|Zionist]] and was supportive of the early creation of the [[State of Israel]], making plans to emigrate there when his military security clearance was revoked.{{sfn|Beta|2008|p=ix}}

== Legacy and influence ==
[[File:Jet Propulsion Laboratory logo.svg|thumbnail|right|The modern logo of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]
In the decades following his death, Parsons would be better remembered among the Western esoteric community rather than their scientific counterpart.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=304}} For instance, English Thelemite [[Kenneth Grant]] suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked the start of the appearance of [[flying saucers]] in the skies.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=188}}

In December 1958, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was integrated into the newly established [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], after having built the ''[[Explorer 1]]'' satellite that commenced America's [[Space Race]] with the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/joinnasa.php|title= Early History > JPL Joins NASA|publisher=''NASA''|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> In October 1968, Malina gave a speech at JPL in which he highlighted Parsons' contribution to the U.S. rocket project and lamented how it had come to be neglected.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=306}}
Among the aerospace industry, JPL was nicknamed as standing for "Jack Parsons' Laboratory" or "Jack Parsons Lives".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=xxv}} The [[International Astronomical Union]] later decided to name a crater on the [[far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon "[[Parsons (crater)|Parsons]]" after him in 1972.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=192|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=307}} In 1989, many of Parsons' writings would see posthumous publication as ''Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword''.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=193}} In 2006, the Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company with the intention of conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and the artwork of his second wife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cameron-parsons.org/ |title=The Cameron-Parsons Foundation, Inc. |publisher=The Cameron-Parsons Foundation, Inc |accessdate=10 January 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MX6uQbXQ |archivedate=10 January 2014}}</ref>

In 1999, [[Feral House]] published John Carter's biography, ''Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons''. Carter expressed the opinion that Parsons had accomplished more in under five years of research than [[Robert H. Goddard]] had in his lifetime, and noted that his role in the development of rocket technology had been neglected by historians of science.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=195}} Conversely, Carter thought that Parsons' abilities and accomplishments as an occultist had been over-estimated and exaggerated among Western esotericists.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=196}}
Feral House republished the work as a new edition in 2004, accompanied with a new introduction from the occultist and author [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson believed that Parsons was "the one single individual who contributed the most to rocket science".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=xi}} He described him as being "very strange, very brilliant, very funny, [and] very tormented",{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=vii}} and considered it noteworthy that the day of Parsons' birth was the predicted beginning of the apocalypse advocated by [[Charles Taze Russell]], the founder of the [[Jehovah's Witness]] movement.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=ix}} A second biography of Parsons would be published in 2005 through [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] as ''Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons''; it was authored by George Pendle, who described Parsons as "the [[Che Guevara]] of occultism".{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=304}} Parsons' involvement in the Agape Lodge would also be discussed by Martin P. Starr in his history of the American Thelemite movement, ''The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites'', published by Teitan Press in 2003.{{sfn|Starr|2003}}

Before his death, Parsons appeared in science fiction writer [[Anthony Boucher]]'s [[murder mystery]] ''[[Rocket to the Morgue]]'' (1942) under the guise of Hugo Chantrelle.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2004|1p=73|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2p=230}} Another fictional character based on Parsons was Courtney James, who features in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s 1956 work ''[[A Gun for Dinosaur]]''.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=305}}
A stage play about Parsons by George D. Morgan, ''Pasadena Babalon'', premiered at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena in 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidesocal.com/rose/2010/02/23/pasadena-babalon-the-world-of-jack-parsons-on-stage-at-caltech/ |title='Pasadena Babalon': The world of Jack Parsons, on stage at Caltech |author=Barge, Evelyn |publisher=Rose Magazine |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=10 January 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MX7chezo |archivedate=10 January 2014}}</ref> and that year Cellar Door Publishing released Richard Carbonneau and Robin Simon's [[graphic novel]], ''The Marvel: A Biography of Jack Parsons''.{{sfnm|1a1=Carbonneau|1a2=Simon|1y=2010}}
