'''''SimTower: The Vertical Empire''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] [[computer game]] developed by [[OPeNBooK Co., Ltd.]] and published by [[Maxis]] for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS 7]] operating systems. It was released in November 1994 in the United States. The game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.

Critical reception towards the game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability to immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game due to the fact that time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.

''SimTower'' allows the player to build and manage the operations of a modern, multi-use [[skyscraper]]. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms with the help of housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic.<ref name=southchina /> ''SimTower'', which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20041018/adams_01.shtml|title=Designer's Notebook  |last=Adams|first=Ernest|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=September 30, 2009}}</ref> 

The game begins with a one-star tower with limited building options. To increase the tower's star rating, it must attract more tenants by providing more living space. New facilities are made available while the tower progresses from a one-star rating to a five-star rating. The tower is limited to a maximum of 100 floors above ground and nine stories below ground. Standard elevators, which can span a maximum of 30 floors, and express elevators, which can span the entire height of the building, must be used efficiently to decrease tenant stress.<ref name=southchina />

Certain events can take place while managing the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player to let them know that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages.<ref name=southchina /> If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, then the tower will gain another star in its tower rating. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, [[Santa Claus]] and his reindeer fly across the tower.<ref name=allgame />

Developed by [[Yoot Saito]] of [[Vivarium Inc.|OPeNBooK]], ''SimTower'' was originally titled ''The Tower''. Maxis localized the game for sale in the United States and the name was changed to capitalize on the popularity of the ''Sim'' franchise and increase sales figures for the game.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = GameAxis Unwired| publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings|SPH Magazines]]| month = September| year = 2000| issue = 60| title = Origin of Species| first = Jonathan| last = Leo| page = 27| issn = 0219-872X}}</ref> It works on computers that can run the [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS 7]] operating systems; the game will operate on 68k-based Macs at the minimum. It requires [[8-bit color]]s and four megabytes of [[random-access memory]].<ref name=southchina /> Graphics and sounds used in ''SimTower'' are similar to [[List of Sim games|previous ''Sim'' games]], and high resolution graphics are also used. The sound effects are kept to a minimum; noises that are played in the background include office "buzz" and elevator bells.<ref name=theage /> A planned expansion to ''[[The Sims]]'' would have added interaction between ''SimTower'', among other ''Sim'' games, and ''The Sims''. Development, however, was discontinued in late-2000.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Maximum PC]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future US]]| month = November| year = 2000| volume = 5| issue = 11| title = The Daily Glitch| first = Josh| last = Catone| page = 104| issn = 1522-4279}}</ref>

==Release and reception==
''SimTower'' was published by [[Maxis]] for the Windows and Mac OS 7 operating systems<ref name=southchina /> in November 1994 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/simtower-the-vertical-empire/release-info |title=Release Information for SimTower: The Vertical Empire |publisher=MobyGames }}</ref> The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' praised the game's formula, noting that it followed in the footsteps of previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing to ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the "homely" feeling of ''SimTower'', in contrast with other ''Sim'' games such as ''[[SimEarth]]'' and ''[[SimLife]]'', which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity.<ref name=southchina>{{cite news |title=The race to build is on! |work=South China Morning Post |date=February 26, 1995 |author=Chan, Margaret }}</ref> Australia's ''[[The Age]]'' found ''SimTower'' a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing ''[[SimFarm]]''.<ref name=theage>{{cite news |title=Tower infernal |work=The Age |date=July 20, 1995 |author=Bowtell, Jed |page=34 }}</ref> Lisa Karen Savignano of [[Allgame]] stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that ''SimTower'' had good [[replay value]] due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game 4 stars out of 5.<ref name=allgame>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=642&tab=review |title=SimTower |publisher=Allgame |date=1997 |author=Savignano, Lisa Karen }}</ref>

The game was criticized by the ''South China Morning Post'' for lacking documentation, making it more difficult to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time plays an important role in earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given.<ref name=southchina /> ''The Age'' was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''{{'}}s plot could have been included.<ref name=theage /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' referred to ''SimTower'' as a "lesser-known" simulation game, and described it as "fun and addictive".<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop|GameStop Corporation]]| month = June| year = 2007| issue = 170| title = Classic GI: The Forgotten Sims| page = 124}}</ref> Writing for the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', Matt Miller felt that, when compared to ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' (1993), gameplay in ''SimTower'' moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building.<ref>{{cite news |title=High-rise anxiety builds with Maxis treat Addictive CD-ROM turns kids, adults into developers, tower landlords |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=1995-06-06 |author=Miller, Matt |page=6 }}</ref> The game was reviewed in 1995 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #217 by Jay & Dee in the "Eye of the Monitor" column.

The game was followed by ''[[Yoot Tower]]'', also designed by Yoot Saito, which was initially released in March 31, 1999 in North America for the [[Mega Drive]].<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/yoottower/similar.html?mode=versions |title=Release Summary |publisher=GameSpot }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Maximum PC]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future US]]| month = February| year = 1999| volume = 4| issue = 2| title = Yoot Tower| page = 44| issn = 1522-4279}}</ref> It was later made available that year in July for the Mac OS and Windows operating systems.
