D.]] in Engineering in 1966 from the university.<ref name="jst-biography">{{Cite web | url = http://www.jst.go.jp/pr/report/report124/nagao.html | title = <U+7814><U+7A76><U+7D71><U+62EC><U+3000><U+3000><U+9577><U+5C3E><U+3000><U+771F><U+6C0F><U+306E><U+7565><U+6B74><U+7B49> | publisher = Japan Science and Technology Agency | accessdate = 2010-03-20 | language = Japanese}}</ref>
In Kyoto University, He became an assistant professor in 1967, an associate professor in 1968, and a professor in 1973.<ref name="jst-biography" /> He served as the 23rd President of Kyoto University (1997<U+2013>2003).<ref name="kyoto-university-president" />
After retirement from the university, he was appointed to the Director of [[National Diet Library]] in 2007.<ref name="ndl-appointed" />

He held the 20th Director of the [[Information Processing Society of Japan]] (IPSJ) (1999<U+2013>2000).<ref name="ipsj">{{Cite web | url = http://www.ipsj.or.jp/03somu/directors/s_presidents.html | title = <U+5F79><U+54E1><U+30FB><U+4EE3><U+8868><U+4F1A><U+54E1><U+30FB><U+6B74><U+4EE3><U+4F1A><U+9577> | publisher = Information Processing Society of Japan | accessdate = 2010-03-20 | language = Japanese}}</ref> In each year from 2005, IPSJ Nagao Special Researcher Award is awarded to young Japanese computer scientists who accomplished notable research.<ref name="ipsj-nagao-award">{{Cite web | url = http://www.ipsj.or.jp/01kyotsu/award/nagaomakoto/index.html | title = <U+9577><U+5C3E><U+771F><U+8A18><U+5FF5><U+7279><U+5225><U+8CDE> | publisher = Information Processing Society of Japan | accessdate = 2010-03-20 | language = Japanese}}</ref>

He is the first President of the [[Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation]] (AAMT), and in each year from 2006, AAMT Nagao Award is awarded to individuals or groups who made contribution to machine translation.<ref name="aamt-nagao-award">{{Cite web | url = http://www.aamt.info/english/nagao-e.htm | title = AAMT Nagao Award | publisher = Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation | accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref>

==Work==
Makoto Nagao is renowned as one of the first scientists who developed practical [[machine translation]] (MT) systems. Between 1982 and 1986, he led the Mu project which aimed at translations for technical papers and became the first successful MT system between English and Japanese.<ref name="acl-award" /> In addition, [[example-based machine translation]], an important approach for MT, is the method proposed by him in the early 1980s.<ref name="acl-award" />

He is also a pioneer of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) for the [[Japanese language]]. In 1994, He created KNP, a dependency analyzer for Japanese, with [[Sadao Kurohashi]].<ref name="knp">Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao. 1994. KN Parser : Japanese Dependency/Case Structure Analyzer. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Sharable Natural Language Resources.</ref><ref>http://www-lab25.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/knp-e.html</ref>
In 1990s, he directed a project to make a Japanese parsed [[text corpus|corpus]],<ref>Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao. 1998. Building a Japanese parsed corpus while improving the parsing system. In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 719<U+2013>724.</ref> which is now called [[Kyoto University Text Corpus]].<ref>http://www-lab25.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/corpus-e.html</ref>
Another NLP resource developed under his laboratory is [[:ja:Juman|Juman]],<ref>http://www-lab25.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/juman-e.html</ref> a Japanese morphological parser and the first system which merged word segmentation and morphological analysis for languages which do not have explicit word boundaries (such as Japanese or Chinese).<ref name="acl-award" />

In [[pattern recognition]] and [[image processing]], he was the first engineer who applied feedback analysis mechanisms to [[facial recognition system]]s, and he introduced various [[artificial intelligence]] techniques into the image processing.<ref name="japan-prize" />

He supervised the Adriadne system, a [[digital library]] system, which made an impact upon digital library research in Japan and over the world.<ref name="acl-award" /> While the National Diet Library of Japan holds a traditional slogan "Truth makes us free" ([[Johannes Passion|John]] 8:32), a new slogan "Through knowledge we prosper" is proposed by him as the director.<ref name="greetings">{{Cite web | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/aboutus/greetings.html | title = Greetings from the Librarian | publisher = National Diet Library | accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref> He is very interested in [[Wikipedia]] and gave a keynote lecture in the Wikimedia Conference Japan 2009.<ref name="wcj2009">{{Cite web | url = http://www.wcj2009.info/<U+958B><U+50AC><U+6982><U+8981> | title = Wikimedia Conference Japan 2009 | publisher = Wikimedia Conference Japan 2009 | accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref>
