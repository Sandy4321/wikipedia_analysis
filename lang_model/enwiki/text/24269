[[Image:Timbaland - Rolling Stone.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Rolling Stone's website covers the controversy on January 18th.]]
In January 2007, several news sources reported that [[Timbaland]] (Timothy Z. Mosley) was alleged to have [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] several elements (both motifs and samples) in the song "[[Do It]]" on the 2006 album ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' by [[Nelly Furtado]] without giving credit or compensation.<ref name="Iltalehti"/><ref name="eDome"/><ref name="Rolling Stone"/> The song itself was released as the fifth North American [[single (music)|single]] from ''Loose'' on [[July 24]], [[2007]].

==Background==

The claimed original track, entitled "Acidjazzed Evening", is a [[chiptune]]-style 4-channel [[Amiga]] [[Module file|module]] composed by [[Finland|Finnish]] [[demoscene]]r [[Janne Suni]] (a.k.a. Tempest). <ref name="tempest">[http://www.fairlight.fi/tempest/ Tempest's website]</ref> The song won first place in the Oldskool Music competition at [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly 2000]], a [[demoparty]] held in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in the year 2000. <ref>[http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=%2Fparties%2F2000%2Fassembly00%2Fresults.txt&fileinfo Scene.org's Assembly 2000 results data]</ref> According to [[Scene.org]], the song was uploaded to their servers the same year, long before the release of the song by Furtado. The song was later remixed (with Suni's permission) by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Glenn Rune Gallefoss]] (a.k.a. GRG) for the [[Commodore 64]] in [[MOS Technology SID|SID format]] - this is the version which was later allegedly sampled for "Do It". It was added to the [[High Voltage SID Collection]] on [[December 21]], 2002.<ref>[http://hangar18.campus.luth.se/exotica/tunes/archive/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/Update34.hvs High Voltage SID Collection Update #34]</ref>

A video which claims to show proof of the theft was posted to [[YouTube]] on [[January 12]],[[2007]].http://www.youtube.com/v/M4KX7SkDe4Q&rel=1<ref>YouTube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4KX7SkDe4Q Producer Timbaland steals song from finnish musician]</ref> Another video was posted to YouTube on [[January 14]], 2007, claiming Timbaland also stole the tune a year earlier for the ringtone ''Block Party'', one of several that were sold in the United States in 2005.<ref>YouTube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV2fTEeP6GM Timbaland steals song - more proof!]</ref>

On [[April 1]], the track for "Do It" (without vocals) was used as theme music for the [[Juno Awards of 2007|2007 Juno Awards]] broadcast, which Furtado hosted. The track was played during the show's opening and before commercial breaks. The controversial samples could be clearly heard throughout.

==Authors' comments==
===Janne Suni===
Janne Suni posted the following comment regarding the copyright status of "Acidjazzed Evening" on [[January 15]], [[2007]]:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"...I have never given up the copyrights of Acidjazzed Evening. I also have never authorized '''commercial''' use of the song. In 2002, however, Glenn Rune Gallefoss (also known as GRG) made a conversion/arrangement of the Acidjazzed Evening which was not released commercially. This arrangement was made on the Commodore 64 computer. It was authorized by me, and Glenn Rune Gallefoss explicitly asked for permission before releasing the arrangement."<ref name="tempest"/></blockquote>

On [[February 16]], [[2007]], he added the following note:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"I'll correct one persistent misconception: I have been using the services of a law firm since September 2006. Things are gradually developing behind the scenes, and whatever the result turns out to be like, I'll publish any available info here as soon as possible."<ref name="tempest"/></blockquote>

On [[September 9]], [[2007]], his webpage was updated with the following information:
<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"My case regarding the controversy has come to its closure. Just as before, I will not answer any questions about the case.
"<ref name="tempest"/></blockquote>

===Glenn Gallefoss===
The C64 news portal C64.sk published the following comment from Glenn R. Gallefoss on [[January 15]], [[2007]]:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"... Its my sid version that has been sampled in do-it : You can hear that by the 11 waveform bleeps I have put in at random plaves (only 3 voices on a sid you know), the arpeggios are using filters, I can even hear the lead using my multipulse routine (which i rarely use, but i did it on acidjazz.sid )."<ref>[http://www.c64.sk/?content=news&searchstring=UPDATE+15.+JAN+2007+15%3A20%3A+GRG C64.sk: GRG<U+2019>s cover of Tempest<U+2019>s tune got ripped]</ref></blockquote>

This implies that the C64 conversion, and subsequently, the alleged sample in "Block Party" and "Do It", were created using GRG's self-developed C64 music program [http://home.eunet.no/~ggallefo/sdi/index.html SDI]. There is also a YouTube video showing the song being played in this program.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFD2LKt18m4 YouTube - Acid Jazzed Evening C64 feat. ' Furtado & Timbaland ']</ref>

On [[February 3]], Gallefoss published the following comment on his personal web page:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"Not much to tell about this matter. I have made a deal with my lawyers. Sometime in the near future, something will happen."<ref>[http://home.eunet.no/~ggallefo/ GRG's web site / news]</ref></blockquote>

===Universal / Nelly Furtado===
Hannu Sormunen, a Finnish representative of Universal, which represents Nelly Furtado in Finland, commented the controversy as follows in the [[January 15]], 2007 issue of [[Iltalehti]]:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">
In case that the artist decides to pursue the matter further, it's on him to go to America and confront them with the local use of law. It will require a considerable amount of faith and, of course, money.<ref name="Iltalehti">[http://www.iltalehti.fi/popstars/200701145593138_ps.shtml Onko Nellyn hitti Suomesta?] ('''Finnish''')<!-- An English alternative for this source would be appropriate, as it is not too hard to find (an American matter, after all). --></ref></blockquote>

The first legal action against Universal Finland was officially filed with Helsinki District Court in mid-August 2007, on behalf of Glenn R. Gallefoss.

===Timbaland===
On [[February 2]], 2007, Timbaland responded to the plagiarism accusations in an interview by the radio show [[Elliot in the Morning]]. In this interview, Timbaland admits to what he calls "sampling", but he also claims that sampling is "not stealing", because "everybody samples from everybody every day". Timbaland also says that the sample is "from a video game" and mentions the Commodore 64. He also says that he has no time for research and that it is sometimes impossible to "know what's public domain and what's not." Timbaland also calls the issue "ridiculous" but mentions that he is "in legal discussions" and therefore can't say much about it. He did, however, call Janne Suni an "idiot" and a "freakin jerk" on the show. He consistently talks about this as sampling, failing to address the claims with regards to the melody. <ref>[http://www.eitmonline.com/eitmonline2/media/eitmlive/timbaland2.mp3 Elliot in the Morning - Timbaland interviewed (MP3)] ([http://www.zxdemo.org/extra/timbaland_radio_transcript.txt transcript])</ref>

On [[February 9]], 2007, Timbaland commented on the issue as follows in an MTV interview:
<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">
"It makes me laugh. The part I don't understand, the dude is      
trying to act like I went to his house and took it from his computer. I      
don't know him from a can of paint. I'm 15 years deep. That's how you        
attack a king? You attack moi? Come on, man. You got to come correct. You    
the laughing stock. People are like, 'You can't be serious.'"<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552023/20070209/timbaland.jhtml Timbaland Still In Shock Over Jay-Z, Madonna, Elton Collaborations]</ref></blockquote>

==Third-party analysis==
A device in Timbaland's studio, as seen in video clips from the MTV show "Timbaland's Diary", has been identified as an [[Elektron SidStation]].<ref name="eDome" /><ref name="C64Audio" /> This device is a MIDI-controlled synthesizer based on the [[MOS Technology SID|SID chip]] of the Commodore 64, and it is capable of playing back .sid files the way they would have sounded on the original hardware. It has been speculated that Timbaland downloaded Gallefoss' version of the song from the [[High Voltage SID Collection]]<ref name="C64Audio" /><ref name="Heise" /> and used the SidStation for running it to the studio system.<ref name="eDome" /><ref name="C64Audio" />

[[Chris Abbott]], maintainer of the website C64Audio.com, posted an in-depth analysis on the topic and summarizes it in his on-line article. Abbott has commercially released Commodore 64 music, most notably the "Back in Time" CD series. Abbott writes regarding the alleged plagiarism:
<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"What appears to have happened is that the three-voice output from the original C64 version has had the bass voice silenced: that missing bass voice then follows the original tune except for a couple of changed notes, and the removal of some octave jumps. However, various technical procedures show that other components of the song (chords/melody/rhythm) have been exactly reproduced. This is vanishingly unlikely to have happened by chance."<ref name="C64Audio">[http://www.c64audio.com/timbaland.php Chris Abbott: Doin' it for themselves: what's going on in Timbaland?]</ref></blockquote>

Abbott also notes that although the evidence seems to be conclusive, the eventual outcome is not. The record company has a multitude of possible reactions to the controversy as well as many possible reasons why the sample was not cleared on the first place.

A more artistic proof of the similarities was made by a blogger who mixed the two songs together and called it ''Do it in the Acid jazzed evening''.<ref>[http://i-am-random-j.blogspot.com/2006/01/timbusted-rickit-rickit.html J's Corner of Randomness: TimBUSTED! *Rickit! Rickit!*]</ref>

==Similar cases==
Earlier examples of unauthorized commercial use of SID music have been brought up by sources covering the Timbaland plagiarism controversy.

An often-mentioned example is [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]'s 1999 hit ''Kernkraft 400'', which was a remake of [[David Whittaker]]'s song for the 1984 Commodore 64 game [[Lazy Jones]]. David Whittaker was paid an undisclosed sum for it.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010630145207/http://www.nme.com/NME/External/News/News_Story/0,1004,9126,00.html NME: OK COMPUTER!]</ref> Another example is the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] hit ''You've Got My Love'', for which the artist [[Bas Bron|Bas "Bastian" Bron]] sampled the drums from [[Jeroen Tel]]'s and [[Reyn Ouwehand]]'s song made for the [[Rubicon (game)|Rubicon]] game. Both of the cases were won by the original authors in court.<ref name="eDome" /><ref name="C64Audio" />

An earlier example of unauthorized use of demoscene-based [[tracker]] music also exists. In 2000, a small-scale American artist ''Jay Newingham'' was found to have directly copied several well-known demoscene songs for his electronica band ''Planet-X'' (not to be confused with [[Derek Sherinian]]'s [[Planet X (band)|Planet X]]), including pieces such as [[Purple Motion]]'s soundtrack for the [[Second Reality]] demo. This case was never taken to the court, however.<ref>[http://mikrobitti.fi/~jukkak/jay/ A scam artist called Jay]</ref>

The [[Fitts for Fight]] case also involved stolen chipmusic.

[[Jamba]] sold music by [[Bodenst<U+00E4>ndig 2000]] without permission.<ref>[http://c64music.blogspot.com/2007/01/chiptune-commercial-rip-offs-striking.html C64 Music: Chiptune Commercial Rip-Off's striking!]</ref>

==Media coverage==
===The beginnings of the controversy===
The earliest [[internet forum]] posts suggesting that "Do It" was based on "Acidjazzed Evening" date back to July 2006<ref>[http://www.vee.fi/musiikki/levyt/nelly_furtado/loose/kayttajien_arviot/ Vee.fi user reviews of Nelly Furtado: Loose]</ref>, and according to the Finnish news portal [[eDome]], "Suni and other demoscene hobbyists" already knew about it at this time.<ref name="eDome">[http://plaza.fi/harrastukset/edome/artikkelit/yleiset/yhdysvaltalaistuottaja-polli-suomalaismuusikolta Yhdysvaltalaistuottaja p<U+00F6>lli suomalaismuusikolta] ('''Finnish''')<!-- An English alternative for this source would be appropriate, as it is not too hard to find (an American matter, after all). --></ref> The controversy began to spread once a comment was posted to the [[Pou<U+00EB>t|Pou<U+00EB>t.net]] forum, a prominent demoscene website, on [[October 4]], 2006.<ref>[http://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=3627&page=1 Pouet discussion thread]</ref> The post did not initially spark a wider internet debate until a [[January 11]], 2007 post was made on the [[Something Awful]] forums.<ref>Something Awful ''[http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2274635 Timbaland ripped off a track from my buddy.]''</ref> The Something Awful post was later covered by [[Slashdot]],<ref>[http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/14/0113234 Slashdot - Did Producer Timbaland Steal From the Demoscene?]</ref> and [[Digg]]<ref>[http://digg.com/music/Timbaland_ripped_off_a_track_from_my_buddy Digg.com Timbaland ripped off a track from my buddy.]</ref> that finally brought larger-scale attention.

===Mainstream coverage===
One of the first large media to react to the on-line controversy was the [[YLE|Finnish Broadcasting Company]], which published a news item on the topic in [[January 14]], 2007.<ref name="YLE">{{cite web|url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kulttuuri/id51183.html|title=Amerikkalaista hiphop-tuottaja Timbalandia syytet<U+00E4><U+00E4>n suomalaisen plagioinnista}}</ref>

The electronic music magazine [[Side-Line]] put a complete news round-up up on its website.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=20102_0_2_0_C Did Bj<U+00F6>rk producer Timbaland steal music from demoscene?

On [[January 16]]th, Finnish news portal [[eDome]] published an article about the case saying in the English summary that:

<blockquote style="background: #F0F0F0; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em;">"It is beyond any doubt that Timothy 'Timbaland' Mosley has directly copied large sections of Janne Suni<U+2019>s songs, much more than any 'fair use' would allow. Timbaland has not sampled tiny bits or effects from the song, but whole sections. This is a clear breach of copyright." <ref name="eDome">[http://plaza.fi/harrastukset/edome/artikkelit/yleiset/yhdysvaltalaistuottaja-polli-suomalaismuusikolta Yhdysvaltalaistuottaja p<U+00F6>lli suomalaismuusikolta]</ref></blockquote>

The article also covered similar cases from the past and notified that both the competition and the prize ceremony "were witnessed by the 4000-5000 people at the event. The competition and the ceremony were also shown in Helsinki area cable TV."<ref name="eDome"/> The same day, the news reached Norwegian media, including [[Norsk rikskringkasting|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/kanal/nrk_p3/5828277.html|title=Norsk offer i plagiat-skandale}}</ref> and [[Dagbladet]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/01/16/489070.html|title=Anklager stjerneprodusent for juks}}</ref>, both of which interviewed Gallefoss. 

On January 17th, the case was reported on briefly by the [[Rolling Stone]] website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/16/kanye-west-and-fall-out-boy-get-intimate-finnish-artists-after-nelly-furtado-jamie-foxx-parses-own-vocabulary/|title=Finnish Artists After Nelly Furtado?}}</ref> [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]],<ref name="XXL">{{cite web|url=http://xxlmag.com/online/?p=6979|title=Revenge Of The Nerds - Timbaland vs. The Internet}}</ref>
and the popular German IT news portal [[Heinz Heise|Heise online]]. Heise's story suggests that Timbaland downloaded Gallefoss's SID arrangement from the [[High Voltage SID Collection]].<ref name="Heise">{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/83835|title=Hiphop-Produzent wilderte in C64-Musikarchiv}}</ref>.

On January 18th, Rolling Stone put the controversy as top news of the day with a more detailed article<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/18/is-timbaland-a-thief/|title=Is Timbaland a Thief?}}</ref>. Later that day the [[San Jose Mercury News]] covered the story in their blog<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2007/01/did_super_produ.html|title=Did Super Producer Timbaland copy the track of "Do It" off of Finnish producer Janne Suni?}}</ref>

On January 22nd, [[MTV]] took notice of the issue with a longer article and according video-news. It is not clear if this video news was merely for online consumption or actually broadcast<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1550506/20070122/timbaland.jhtml|title=YouTube Clip Claims Timbaland Got Furtado Track From Finnish Dude}}</ref>. MTV owned sister station [[VH-1]] also published the MTV news story. MTV had apparently tried to reach Timbaland's representatives via phone and e-mail, but they "had not responded at press time".<ref name="MTV" />

===Criticism===
The controversy has also been criticized. According to [[XXL Magazine]], there has been too much media coverage on the event. XXL claims that much of the visibility can be attributed to "the collective pride of a bunch of geeks and their ongoing war with mainstream media". XXL also claims that plagiarism of this scale happens all the time, and goes on to compare it to the kind of sampling found in "90% of pre-1997 hip hop" as well as to the riff-stealing in blues and rock music.<ref name="XXL"/>
