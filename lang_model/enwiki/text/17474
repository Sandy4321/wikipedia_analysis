Chapman began her football career playing at primary school in her hometown of [[Bermondsey]]. At the age of ten, she joined leading women's club [[Millwall Lionesses L.F.C.|Millwall Lionesses]]. In the 1996<U+2013>97 season, Chapman made her senior team debut at the age of&nbsp;14. She became a regular starter in the team and also participated in the 1997 [[FA Women's Premier League Cup]] and [[FA Women's Cup]] final wins. In the 1998<U+2013>99 campaign, Chapman won the [[Football Association|FA]] Young Player of the Year award. Already a full England international, she left Millwall in 2000 to sign a professional contract with [[Fulham L.F.C.|Fulham]]. She played on the teams that won back-to-back promotions, as well as the 2001<U+2013>02 Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup. In June&nbsp;2001 Chapman was again named FA Young Player of the Year. After two years with [[Charlton Athletic L.F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] from 2004, Chapman joined [[Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies]] and reached prominence with the team in her first season, winning a domestic treble as well as the [[UEFA Women's Cup]]. She had missed significant sections of the 2002<U+2013>03 and 2007<U+2013>08 seasons through pregnancy, and spent a single season with [[Women's Professional Soccer|WPS]] team [[Chicago Red Stars]] in 2010, before returning to Arsenal Ladies.

Chapman is a former [[England women's national football team|England]] U&ndash;18 captain. She made her senior international debut aged 17 in May&nbsp;2000 in a [[2001 UEFA Women's Championship qualification]] match against [[Switzerland women's national football team|Switzerland]]. The following month, she made her first start against [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]]. In March&nbsp;2002 she netted her first senior international goal in a 4<U+2013>1 [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification]] win in the [[Netherlands women's national football team|Netherlands]]. Chapman has represented England at four major international tournaments; [[2001 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Euro 2001]], [[2005 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Euro 2005]], [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2009 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Euro 2009]]. A two&ndash;time winner of the FA International Player of the Year in 2002 and 2010, Chapman retired from the national team in March 2011 with a total of 82 caps and eight goals.
