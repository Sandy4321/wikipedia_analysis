'''Blue Note Records''' is a [[jazz]] [[record label]], established in 1939 by [[Alfred Lion]] and [[Max Margulis]]. [[Francis Wolff]] became involved shortly afterwards. It derives its name from the characteristic "[[blue note]]s" of jazz and the [[blues]].  Blue Note Records is currently owned by the [[EMI|EMI Group]] and in 2006 was expanded to fill the role of an umbrella label group bringing together a wide variety of EMI-owned labels and imprints specializing in the growing market segment of music for adults (see [[#Resurrection|History-Resurrection, below]]).

Blue Note throughout its history has principally been associated with the "hard bop" style of jazz (mixing [[bebop]] with other forms of music including [[soul music|soul]], blues, [[rhythm and blues]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]). [[Horace Silver]], [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Lou Donaldson]], [[Donald Byrd]] and [[Grant Green]] were among the label's leading artists, but almost all the important musicians in postwar jazz recorded for Blue Note on occasion, albeit most often only once.

==History==
===Early years===
Lion first heard jazz as a young boy in [[Berlin]]. He moved to [[New York]] in 1937, and in 1939 recorded pianists [[Albert Ammons]] and [[Meade Lux Lewis]] in a one-day session in a rented studio. The Blue Note label initially consisted of Lion and Max Margulis, a communist writer who funded the project. The label's first releases were traditional "hot" jazz and [[boogie woogie]], and the label's first hit was a performance of "[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]" by saxophonist [[Sidney Bechet]]. Musicians were supplied with alcoholic refreshments, and recorded in the early hours of the morning after their evening's work in clubs and bars had finished.  The label soon became known for treating musicians uncommonly well - setting up recording sessions at congenial times, and allowing them to be involved in all aspects of the record's production. 

Francis Wolff, a professional photographer, emigrated to the USA at the end of 1939 and soon joined forces with Lion, a childhood friend. In 1941, Lion was drafted into the army for two years. [[Milt Gabler]] at the [[Commodore Records|Commodore Music Store]] offered storage facilities and helped keep the catalog in print, with Wolff working for him. By late 1943, the label was back in business recording musicians and supplying records to the armed forces. Willing to record artists that most other labels would consider to be uncommercial, in December of 1943, the label initiated more sessons with artists such as  pianist Art Hodes,trumpeter Sidney DeParis, clarinetist Edmond Hall, and the great Harlem Stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]], who was returning to a high degree of musical activity after having largely recovered from a stroke suffered in 1940.

===Bebop===
Towards the end of the war, saxophonist [[Ike Quebec]] was among those who recorded for the label. Quebec would act as a talent scout for the label until his death in 1963. Although belonging to a previous generation, he could appreciate the new bebop style of jazz, largely created by [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]]. 

In 1947, pianist [[Thelonious Monk]] recorded his first sessions as a leader for the label, which were also the Blue Note debut of drummer Art Blakey. Monk's recordings for Blue Note between 1947 and 1952 did not sell well, but have since come to be regarded as amongst the most important of the bebop era. Other bebop or [[modernist]] musicians who recorded for Blue Note during the late forties and early fifties were pianist [[Tadd Dameron]], trumpeters [[Fats Navarro]] and [[Howard McGhee]] (featuring trombonist [[J. J. Johnson]]), saxophonist [[James Moody]] and pianist [[Bud Powell]]. The sessions by Powell, like those his close friend Monk recorded for the label, are commonly ranked among his best. J. J. Johnson and trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] both recorded several sessions for Blue Note between 1952 and 1954, but by then the musicians who had created bebop were starting to explore other styles.

===Hard bop and beyond===

In 1951 Blue Note issued their first vinyl 10" releases, and the label was soon recording new talent such as Horace Silver (who would stay with Blue Note for a quarter of a century), the Jazz Messengers (originally a collaborative group, but soon to become Art Blakey's band), [[Milt Jackson]] (in what would soon become the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]), [[Clifford Brown]] and [[Herbie Nichols]]. [[Rudy Van Gelder]] recorded most Blue Note releases from 1953 until the late sixties, and his often-praised engineering was, in its own way, as important and revolutionary as the music. Another important difference between Blue Note and other independent labels (for example [[Prestige Records]], who also employed Van Gelder) was that musicians were paid for rehearsal time prior to the recording session; this helped ensure a better end result on the record. Producer Bob Porter of Prestige Records (along with [[Riverside Records]] probably Blue Note's only serious competition during the 1950s and 1960s) was famously quoted as saying that "The difference between Blue Note and Prestige is two days rehearsal."[http://www.birdpages.co.uk/magazine/blueprintsofjazz2.htm] [[organ (music)|Organist]] Jimmy Smith was signed in 1956, and was responsible for the first 12" LP album of original material released by the company.

The late fifties saw debut recordings for Blue Note by (amongst others) [[Hank Mobley]], Lee Morgan, [[Sonny Clark]], [[Kenny Dorham]], [[Kenny Burrell]], [[Jackie McLean]], Donald Byrd and Lou Donaldson. [[Sonny Rollins]] briefly recorded for the label in 1956 and 1957 and Bud Powell returned. [[John Coltrane]]'s ''[[Blue Train (album)|Blue Train]]'', and [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s ''[[Somethin' Else (Cannonball Adderley album)|Somethin' Else]]'' (featuring Miles Davis in a rare supporting role) were guest appearances on the label.  Blue Note was by then recording a mixture of established acts (Rollins, Adderley) and artists who in some cases had recorded before, but often produced performances for the label which by far exceeded earlier recordings in quality (''Blue Train'' is generally considered to be the first significant recording by Coltrane as a leader).  Horace Silver and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers continued to release a series of artistically and commercially successful recordings.

The early sixties introduced [[Dexter Gordon]] to the label. Gordon was a saxophonist from the bebop era who had spent several years in prison for narcotic offences, and he made several albums for Blue Note over a five year period, including several at the beginning of his sojourn in Europe. Gordon also appeared on the debut album by [[Herbie Hancock]] - by the mid sixties, all four of the younger members of the Miles Davis quintet (Hancock, [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Ron Carter]] and [[Tony Williams]]) were recording for the label, and Hancock and Shorter in particular produced a succession of superb albums in a variety of styles.  Carter did not actually record under his own name until the label's resurrection in the 1980s, but played [[double bass]] on many other musicians' sessions.  Many of these also included Freddie Hubbard, a trumpeter who also recorded for the label as a leader. One of the features of the label during this period was a "family" of musicians (Hubbard, Hancock, Carter, Grant Green, [[Joe Henderson]], Kenny Dorham, Lee Morgan, Hank Mobley and many others) who would record as sidemen on each other's albums without necessarily being part of the leader's [[working group]].

In 1963 Lee Morgan scored a significant hit with the title track of ''[[The Sidewinder]]'' album, and Horace Silver did the same the following year with ''[[Song for My Father]]''.  As a result, Lion was under pressure by independent distributors to come up with similar successes, with the result that many Blue Note albums of this era start with a catchy tune intended for heavy airplay in the United States.

===The avant garde===
[[Image:Dolphy Out To Lunch.png|frame|right|200px|Eric Dolphy, ''Out to Lunch'', 1964]]
Although many of the acts on Blue Note were recording commercial jazz for a wide audience, the label also made some attempt to document the emerging avant-garde and [[free jazz]] movement.  [[Andrew Hill]], a highly individual pianist, made several albums for the label, one featuring multi-instrumentalist [[Eric Dolphy]].  Dolphy's ''[[Out to Lunch!]]'' (featuring a famous cover by [[Reid Miles]]) is perhaps his most well-known album. Saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]] released two albums recorded with a trio in a Stockholm club, and three studio albums (including ''The Empty Foxhole'', with his ten-year-old son [[Denardo Coleman]] on drums). Pianist [[Cecil Taylor]] recorded a brace of albums for Blue Note during the early part of his career, and saxophonist [[Sam Rivers]], drummer Tony Williams, vibraphonist [[Bobby Hutcherson]] and organist [[Larry Young (jazz)|Larry Young]] also recorded albums which diverged from the "hard bop" style usually associated with the label. Saxophonist Jackie McLean, a stalwart of the label's hard bop output since the late 1950s, also crossed over into the avant garde in the early 1960s. He recorded a string of notable avant garde albums including ''One Step Beyond'' and ''Destination Out''.

Though these avant garde records did not sell as well as some other Blue Note releases, Lion thought it was important to document new developments in jazz.

===Cover art===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sonny rollins.vol.1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sonny Rollins, ''Volume 1'', 1956]] -->
In 1956, Blue Note employed Reid Miles, an artist who worked for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. The cover art produced by Miles, often featuring Wolff's photographs of musicians in the studio, was as influential in the world of graphic design as the music within would be in the world of jazz.<ref>"Design Icon: Blue Note" ''Computer Arts'' [http://www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/features/design_icon_blue_note]</ref> Under Miles, Blue Note was known for their striking and unusual album cover designs. Miles' graphical design was distinguished by its tinted black and white photographs, creative use of [[sans-serif]] typefaces, and restricted color palette (often black and white with a single color), and frequent use of solid rectangular bands of color or white. 

Though Miles' work is closely associated with Blue Note, and has earned iconic status and frequent ''homage'', Miles was only a casual jazz fan, according to Richard Cook<ref>Cook, Richard, ''Blue Note Records: The Biography''Boston: Justin Charles, 2003; ISBN 1932112103</ref>; Blue Note gave him several copies of each of the many dozens of albums he designed, but Miles gave most to friends or sold them to second-hand record shops. 

A few mid-fifties album covers featured drawings by an as-yet-little-known [[Andy Warhol]].<ref> Blue Note Website [http://www.bluenote.com/detail.asp?SelectionID=10559]</ref>

===Lion and Wolff retire===
Blue Note was acquired by [[Liberty Records]] in 1965 and Lion, who had difficulties working within a larger organisation, retired in 1967. Reid Miles' association with the label ended around this time. For a few years most albums were produced by Wolff or pianist [[Duke Pearson]]; Wolff though died in 1971. [[George Butler (record producer)|George Butler]] became responsible for the label, but despite some good albums, the commercial viability of jazz was in question, and more borderline and outright commercial records were made (often by artists who had previously recorded "straight" jazz for the label - Bobby Hutcherson, Lou Donaldson, Donald Byrd, Grant Green, Horace Silver).

==Legacy==
The musical legacy of Blue Note Records is one of the most influential and important in the history of recorded [[popular music]].  Blue Note was one of the largest, most successful independent labels of its time.  Comparatively, no genre-specific, independent label has ever had such a deep catalog with such well-regarded musicians.

In 2003, hip hop producer [[Madlib]] released "[[Shades of Blue]]: Madlib Invades Blue Note," a collection of his remixes and interpretations of classic Blue Note music.  Pete Rock, J. Dilla, and DJ Spinna have likewise been involved in similar projects.

In 2004, [[Burning Vision Entertainment]] created the video for [http://www.burningvision.digitalresolve.co.uk/helicoptor_f.html Helicopter Girl's 'Angel City'] using the art from numerous Blue Note LP sleeves to startling effect.

In 2008, hip hop producer [[Questlove]] of [[The Roots]] compiled "Droppin' Science: Greatest Samples from the Blue Note Lab," a collection of original Blue Note recordings sampled by modern-day hip hop artists such as [[Dr. Dre]] and the supergroup, [[A Tribe Called Quest]].

==Reissues & new albums==

EMI purchased United Artists in 1979, who had absorbed Liberty Records in 1969, and phased out the Blue Note label which laid dormant until 1985, when it was relaunched as part of [[EMI Manhattan Records]], both for re-issues and new recordings. Some artists previously associated with Blue Note, such as [[McCoy Tyner]] have made new recordings, while younger musicians such as [[Joe Lovano]], [[John Scofield]], [[Greg Osby]], [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]] and arranger / composer [[Bob Belden]] have established notable reputations through their Blue Note albums.  The label has also found great commercial success with the vocalist [[Norah Jones]], and released new albums by established artists on the fringes of jazz such as [[Van Morrison]], [[Al Green]],  [[Anita Baker]] and newcomer [[Amos Lee]], sometimes referred to as the 'male Norah Jones'. Two of the leading trumpeters of the 1980s Jazz Resurgence, [[Wynton Marsalis]] and [[Terence Blanchard]] signed with the label in 2003.

Blue Note has also pursued an active reissue program in recent years. [[Bruce Lundvall]] was appointed to oversee the label at the time of the revival and [[Michael Cuscuna]] has since worked as freelance advisor and reissue producer. Some of Blue Note's output has appeared in CD Box sets issued by [[Mosaic Records]] (also involving Cuscuna), and there has been a series of reissues of older material, much of it in the "RVG series", remastered by Rudy Van Gelder. Today, Blue Note Records is the flagship jazz label for [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] [[Jazz]] and [[European classical music|Classics]] and is the parent label for the Capitol Jazz, [[Pacific Jazz Records|Pacific Jazz]] and [[Roulette Records|Roulette]] Jazz labels.

In 2006, EMI expanded Blue Note to create the '''Blue Note Label Group''' by moving its Narada group of labels to New York to join with Blue Note, centralizing EMI's approach to music for the adult market segment.  The labels newly under the Blue Note umbrella are [[Angel Records]], [[EMI Classics]] and Virgin Classics (classical music), [[Narada Productions]] (contemporary jazz and world-influenced music, including exclusively licensed sub-label [[Real World Records]]), [[Back Porch Records]] (folk and Americana), [[Higher Octave Records]] (New Age music), and Mosaic Records (devoted exclusively to reissuing jazz recordings in limited-edition boxed sets). <ref>[http://hypebot.typepad.com/hypebot/2006/07/emi_combines_bl.html Hypebot article reporting Blue Note Label Group formation]</ref><ref>[http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2006/press36.htm EMI announces formation of Blue Note Label Group -- new label structure for adult pop, jazz & classics]</ref> As of June 2007, Bruce Lundvall, founder of [[Manhattan Records]], continues as President/CEO of the Blue Note Label Group, reporting directly to Eric Nicoli, the Chief Executive Officer of EMI Group.  <ref>[http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press5.htm EMI Music forms Capitol Music Group in the United States comprising Capitol and Virgin imprints]</ref>
