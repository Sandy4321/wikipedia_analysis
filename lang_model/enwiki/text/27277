'''Mexborough (Ferry Boat) Halt''' was a small [[railway station]] on the [[South Yorkshire Railway]]'s line between [[Barnsley railway station|Barnsley]] and [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]] in [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]. Although it was situated in the parish of [[Old Denaby]], the boundary being the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]], it was close by the Ferry Boat crossing of the river and the swing bridge over the canal, a short distance from the original centre of Mexborough, around where the parish church now stands. 

At this point the line is crossed by a footpath which connects Mexborough to Old Denaby. Access to the platform was from this path. The railway was controlled by a signal box known as "Ferry Boat Crossing"
