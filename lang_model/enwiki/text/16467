'''Human rights in Qatar''' refers to the individual rights of the residents of [[Qatar]].

[[Qatar]] is a country located on a small peninsula branching off of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], into the [[Persian Gulf]]. It was formerly a [[British Empire|British]] [[protectorate]], and formally announced independence on [[September 3]], [[1971]]. It is an [[absolute monarchy]], led by the [[Emir]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]], who came into power after deposing his father while he was in [[Switzerland]]. Under Hamad's leadership, Qatar entered a period of rapid liberalization, and is now known to allow alchohol consumption, and women's right to vote.

==Forced labour and slavery==
According to the [[US State Department]]<U+2019>s Trafficking in Persons Report, men and women who are lured into Qatar by promises of high wages are often forced into underpaid labour. The report states that Qatari laws against forced labour are rarely enforced and that labour laws often result in the detention of victims in deportation centers pending the completion of legal proceedings. The report ranks Qatar at Tier-3, which groups countries that neither satisfy the minimum standards nor demonstrate a significant effort to come into compliance.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2007/82807.htm|title= Country Narratives -- Countries Q through Z|accessdate=2008-03-25 |date= 2007-06-12|work= Trafficking in Persons Report|publisher= Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, [[United States Department of State]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |coauthors= Labott, Elise; Verjee, Zane|title= India escapes U.S. list of worst human traffickers|url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/12/human.trafficking/index.html|work= cnn.com|publisher= [[CNN|Cable News Network]]|location= [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]|date= 2007-06-12|accessdate=2008-03-25 }}</ref>

In common with other Gulf countries, sponsorship laws exist in Qatar. These laws have been widely described as akin to modern-day slavery<ref>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,QAT,4562d8cf2,484f9a3732,0.html</ref>. The Sponsorship system (Kafeel or Kafala) exists throughout the GCC and means that a worker (not a tourist) may not enter the country without having a kafeel, cannot leave without the kafeel's permission (an Exit Permit must first be awarded by the sponsor, or kafeel), and the sponsor has the right to ban entering the employee from entering Qatar within 2-5 years of his first departure. Many sponsors do not allow the transfer of one employee to another sponsor.

The Government of Qatar maintains that it is setting the benchmark when it comes to [[human rights]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20060503034405|title= Qatar: National Human Rights Committee report|accessdate=2008-03-25 |date= 2006-05-03|work= |publisher=Qatar National Human Rights Committee}}.

Qatari contracting agency Barwa is constructing a residential area for labourers known as Barwa Al Baraha (also called Workers City). The project was launched after a recent scandal in [[Dubai]]'s Labour 'Slave' camps. The project aims to provide a reasonable standard of living as defined by the new Human Rights Legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iloveqatar.net/forum/read.php?28,2540,2540|title= Qatar: National Human Rights Committee Support Expats|accessdate=2008-08-04 |date= 2008-06-18|work= |publisher=The Peninsula via iLoveQatar.net}}</ref> The Barwa Al Baraha will cost around $1.1 billion and will be a completely integrated city in the Industrial area of Doha.  Along with 4.25 square metres of living space per person, the residential project will provide parks, recreational areas, malls, and shops for labourers. Phase one of the project is set to be completed at the end of 2008 while all phases will be complete by mid 2010.<ref>{{cite news |first= D|last= Bowman|authorlink= |title= Qatar to build $1.1bn labourer city|url= http://www.arabianbusiness.com/512568-qatar-to-build-11bn-labourer-city|work= ArabianBusiness.com|publisher= ITP Digital Publishing|location= [[Dubai]]|date= 2008-03-02|accessdate=2008-03-25 }}</ref>

== Individual rights ==

=== Capital Punishment ===
Qatar retains the [[death penalty]], primarily for espionage,<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE220012002?open&of=ENG-QAT Qatar: Death Penalty, Firas Nassuh Salim Al-Majali | Amnesty International<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or other threats against national security.<ref>[http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story1331.shtml Journalism.co.uk :: Crusading journalist wins case against Al-Jazeera<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Apostasy]] is also considered a capital offense, but there are no known executions for it.

=== Gender Equality ===
In 1999, Qatar became the first country on [[The Persian Gulf]] to allow women to legally vote or gain senior positions in government.<ref>"In Bahrain, Women Run, Women Vote, Women Lose" [http://www.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE5D61338F931A15756C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&&scp=1&sq=qatar%20women%20vote&st=cse New York Times]</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Nima|last= Elbagir|authorlink= |title= The role of Saudi women|url= http://www.channel4.com/more4/news/news-opinion-feature.jsp?id=527|publisher= [[Channel 4]]|location= |date= 2007-02-08|accessdate=2008-03-25 }} Link to the full Channel 4 video report.</ref> Women are also allowed to dress in whatever they like, as are men.

=== Freedom of religion ===
Qatar is a [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim-majority nation]], with 76% of its population adhering to [[Islam]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/qa.html#People 2004 Census <U+2013> CIA World Factbook <U+2013> Qatar].</ref> The government uses [[Sunni]] law as the basis of its regulations. However, there are various minority religions located in the area, primarily including [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], [[Sikhs]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s]]. No foreign missionary groups operate openly in the country but in 2008 the government allowed some churches to conduct mass. In March 2008 the Roman Catholic church <U+201C>Our Lady of the Rosary<U+201D> was consecrated in Doha.

Alchohol consumtion is legalized in Qatar, but with significant limitations. Bars and nightclubs are restricted to only expensive hotels and nightclubs. Non-Muslims in Qatar are eligible to receive liquor permits permitting them to purchase alcohol for personal use through Qatar Distribution Company.

=== LGBT rights in Qatar ===
[[Sodomy]] between same-sex adults in Qatar is illegal, and subject to a sentence of up to five years in prison.<ref>Ready, Freda. ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'' article [http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/qatar/qanews05.htm] Retrieved on December 4, 2002</ref>
