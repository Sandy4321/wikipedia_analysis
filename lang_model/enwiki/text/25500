'''Roger Keith "Syd" Barrett''' (6 January 1946&nbsp;<U+2013> 7 July 2006), was an [[English people|English]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[guitarist]] and [[painting|painter]], best remembered as a <!--"founder member" is the correct term in the UK--do not change it to "founding member"--> founder member of the band [[Pink Floyd]]. He was the lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter during the band's [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] years, providing major musical and stylistic direction in their early work, including their name. He left the group in April 1968 amid speculations of mental illness exacerbated by drug use, and was briefly hospitalised.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=R. Gary|title=Take a Walk on the Dark Side: Rock and Roll Myths, Legends, and Curses|date=6 July 2004|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0-7432-4423-7|page=180}}</ref>

He was active in music for only about seven years, recording four singles, [[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|the debut album]] (and contributed to [[A Saucerful of Secrets|the second one]]), plus several unreleased songs with Pink Floyd. In 1969, Barrett released a solo single, "[[Octopus (song)|Octopus]]", which foreshadowed his first (of two) solo album, ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'' (1970). ''The Madcap Laughs'' was recorded over the course of one year (1968<U+2013>1969) with 4 different producers ([[Peter Jenner]], Malcolm Jones, [[David Gilmour]] and [[Roger Waters]]). Nearly two months after ''Madcaps'' was released, Barrett begun working on his second album, ''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]'' (produced by Gilmour and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]), which would be released in late 1970, before going into self-imposed seclusion lasting more than thirty years. In 1988, an album of unreleased tracks/alternate takes, ''[[Opel (album)|Opel]]'', was released by [[EMI]] with Barrett's approval. 

Barrett's innovative guitar work and exploration of experimental techniques such as using [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]], [[distortion]], and [[feedback]] had an enormous legacy, with a wide variety of musicians from [[David Bowie]] to [[Brian Eno]] to [[Jimmy Page]] and more drawing influence. In his post-musician life, Barrett continued with his painting and dedicated himself to gardening, never to return to the public eye. He died in 2006. A number of biographies have been written about him since the 1980s, and Pink Floyd wrote and recorded several tributes to him after he left, most notably the 1975 album ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''.

===Pink Floyd years (1965<U+2013>68)===
Starting in 1964, the band that would become Pink Floyd underwent various line-up and name changes such as "The Abdabs",<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=14|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> "The Screaming Abdabs", "The Sigma 6",<ref>{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Mark|title=Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd|year=2008|publisher=Da Capo|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-306-81752-7|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=38|chapter=The Endless Summer}}</ref> and "The Meggadeaths". In 1965, Barrett joined them as [[The Tea Set]]<ref name=autogenerated9>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=15|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> (sometimes spelt as T-Set),<ref name="blake43">{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Mark|title=Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd|year=2008|publisher=Da Capo|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-306-81752-7|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=43|chapter=The Endless Summer}}</ref> and when they found themselves playing a concert with a band of the same name, Barrett came up with the name "The Pink Floyd Sound" (also known as "The Pink Floyd Blues Band",<ref name="blake43"/> later "The Pink Floyd"). He devised the name "Pink Floyd" by juxtaposing the first names of [[Pink Anderson]] and [[Floyd Council]] whom he had read about in a sleeve note by [[Paul Oliver]] for a 1962 [[Blind Boy Fuller]] LP (Philips BBL-7512): "[[Curley Weaver]] and Fred McMullen, (...&nbsp;) [[Pink Anderson]] or [[Floyd Council]]<U+2014>these were a few amongst the many blues singers who were to be heard in the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys".<ref>{{cite web | title = Floyd Council | url = http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/council.html | accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=19|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> Barrett used "Pink and Floyd" as the name of his two pet cats.<ref name="blake43"/> Barrett also told the story that the name was transmitted to him by a flying saucer<ref>{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Mark|title=Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd|year=2008|publisher=Da Capo|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-306-81752-7|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=44|chapter=The Endless Summer}}</ref> while he was sitting on [[Glastonbury Tor]].<ref name="Times obit"/><ref name=autogenerated10 />

During 1965, they went into a studio for the first time, after a friend of [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]'s was giving the band free time.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> They recorded a cover of Slim Harpo's "[[I'm a King Bee]]", and 3 Barrett originals: "Double O Bo", "Butterfly" and "Lucy Leave".<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|pages=15<U+2013>16|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> "Double O Bo" and "Lucy Leave", were pressed as vinyl [[acetates]].<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=16|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> At this time, Barrett had moved to Earlham Street, in [[Covent Garden]]. With the new residency, Barrett met (among others) Peter Wynne Wilson and Susie Gawler-Wright, "The Psychedelic Debutante", which would provide lighting for Pink Floyd shows later on.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> In the summer of 1965, Barrett had begun a affair with Lindsay Corner.<ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=17|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> It was during this summer, Barrett had his first [[Acid (drug)|acid]] trip in the garden of friend, Dave Gale, with Ian Moore and Thorgerson.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> While on the influence of the acid, Barrett had placed an orange, plum and a matchbox into a corner, while staring at the fruit, which he claimed symbolized "Venus and Jupiter".<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Thorgerson later used this imagery, by adding the previously mentioned items to the cover of the double album combination of Barrett's solo albums: ''[[Syd Barrett (album)|Syd Barrett]]''.<ref name=autogenerated7 />

In August 1965, Barrett (without the band) together with other people, went to [[St. Tropez]], in France, travelling via Land Rover, meeting up with Gilmour at the end of the journey.<ref name=autogenerated11>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=18|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> There, Barrett and Gilmour were arrested for [[busking]] on the streets (they played Beatles songs).<ref name=autogenerated11 /> Later, they trekked to Paris, camping outside the city for the course of a week and visiting one of the landmarks, the [[Louvre]].<ref name=autogenerated11 /> After arriving back in London, the entire band were taking acid frequently.<ref name=autogenerated11 /> In one period of experimentation with acid, Barrett and another friend end up naked in the bath, reciting: "No rules, no rules".<ref name=autogenerated11 /> Later on in the summer, as a consequence of the continuation of drug use, the band became absorbed in [[Sant Mat]], a Sikh sect.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Thorgerson (now living on Earlham Street) and Barrett went to a London hotel to meet the sect's [[guru]];<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Thorgerson managed to join the sect, while Barrett, however, was too young to join.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Thorgerson perceives this as a deeply important event in Barrett's life, as he was intensely upset by the rejection.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> While living within close proximity of his friends, Barrett decided to write more songs ("[[Bike (song)|Bike]]" was written around this time).<ref name=autogenerated10 />

====London Underground====
While Pink Floyd began by playing cover versions of American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs (in much the same vein as contemporaries [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Yardbirds]], and [[The Kinks]]), by 1966 they had carved out their own style of improvised rock and roll,<ref>{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Mark|title=Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd|year=2008|publisher=Da Capo|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-306-81752-7|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=45|chapter=The Endless Summer}}</ref> which drew as much from improvised [[jazz]] as it did from British pop-rock, such as that championed by [[The Beatles]]. After [[Bob Klose]] departed from the band, for the rest of the members, the band's direction changed, with more improvising on the guitars and [[keyboards]].<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Mason said on the change: "It always felt to me that most of the ideas were emanating from Syd at the time".<ref name=autogenerated10 /> In October 1965, after a jam with Gilmour at the 21st birthday party of Thorgerson's girlfriend, Libby January, the band got drunk.<ref name=autogenerated12>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=20|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref> They were so drunk that Barrett tried to whip off a tablecloth, with all items on the table, managing to crash the items on to the floor.<ref name=autogenerated12 /> Barrett, frequently at his Earlham Road residence, played [[The Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'', [[The Byrds]]' ''[[Fifth Dimension (album)|Fifth Dimension]]'' and [[The Fugs]]' and [[Love (band)|Love]]'s debut albums, repeatedly.<ref name=autogenerated14>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=26|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> All these albums were connected by their proto-psychedelic field, which had begun to guide Barrett's songs, as much as R&B had, previously.<ref name=autogenerated14 /> "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]" (included into the band's setlist from autumn), for example, was inspired by the [[riff]] from Love's "My Little Red Book", the [[free-form]] section (and also, "[[Pow R. Toc H.]]") was inspired by [[Frank Zappa]]'s free-form freak-outs and The Byrds' "[[Eight Miles High]]".<ref name=autogenerated14 /> The Kinks' "[[Sunny Afternoon]]" was an important influence on Barrett's songwriting.<ref name=autogenerated14 />

At this time, Barrett's reading reputedly contained (among others: [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]]'s ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Fairy Tales]]'', [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Carlos Castaneda]]'s ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan]]'' (hippie bible), and  ''[[Iching|The I-Ching]]''.<ref name=autogenerated14 /> During this period, Barrett wrote most of the songs for, not only, Pink Floyd's [[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|first album]], but also most of the songs that would later be on his solo albums.<ref name=autogenerated14 /> In 1966, a new rock concert venue, the [[UFO Club|UFO]] (pronounced as "you-foe"),<ref name=autogenerated19>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=30|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> opened in London and quickly became a haven for British [[psychedelic music]].

====Blackhill Enterprises and gigs====
{{See also|Blackhill Enterprises}}
By the end of 1966, Pink Floyd had gained a reliable management team in [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] and [[Peter Jenner]].<ref name=autogenerated16>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=25|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> Towards the end of October 1966, Pink Floyd, with King and Jenner, set up [[Blackhill Enterprises]], to manage the group's finances.<ref name=autogenerated15>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=28|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> Blackhill was staffed by lodgers Jenner found in his Edbrooke Road house, among others, Barrett's flatmate, Peter Wynne Wilson (who became road manager, however, since he had more experience in lighting, he was also lighting assistant).<ref name=autogenerated15 /> King and Jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal, so in November 1966, they booked session at Thompson Private Recording Studio, in [[Hemel Hempstead]].<ref name=autogenerated15 /> The demo recordings consist of "I Get Stoned" (aka "Stoned Alone"), "Let's Roll Another One", "Lucy Lee in Blue Tights" and a 15 minute version of "Interstellar Overdrive".<ref name=autogenerated15 /> King said of the demos: "That was the first time I realised they were going to write all their own material, Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight".<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|pages=28<U+2013>29|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> 

King and Jenner befriended American expatriate [[Joe Boyd]], the promoter of the [[UFO Club]], who was making a name for himself as one of the more important entrepreneurs on the British music scene. The newly-hired booking agent, [[Bryan Morrison]], and Boyd had proposed spending in better quality recordings.<ref name=autogenerated17>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=29|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> From Morrison's agency, later November, the band played a gig outside London for the first time.<ref name=autogenerated17 /> On 18 November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian Hominids, a multimedia event arranged by the group's former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art.<ref name=autogenerated17 /> The next night, they performed at the Canterbury Technical College, with a 15-foot tinfoil Buddha towering behind them. This attracted lots of press attention.<ref name=autogenerated17 /> They continued to perform the Free School for the following two weeks, before performing on 3 December at the Psychodelphia Versus Ian Smith event at the Roundhouse, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an [[Oxfam]] benefit at the [[Albert Hall]] (the band's biggest venue up to this point).<ref name=autogenerated17 />

At the beginning of 1967, Barrett was dating Jenny Spires (who would later marry future [[Stars (British band)|Stars]] member, [[Stars (British band)|Jack Monck]]), however, unknown to Barrett, Spires had an affair with [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]].<ref name=autogenerated18>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=31|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> Spires convinced Whitehead (who thought the band sounds like "bad Schoenberg")<ref name=autogenerated18 /> to utilize Pink Floyd in a film about the [[swinging London]] scene.<ref name=autogenerated18 /> So at the cost of <U+00A3>80, in February, Whitehead took the band into [[John Wood (music producer)|John Wood]]'s Sound Techniques in Chelsea, with Boyd in tow.<ref name=autogenerated18 /> Here, the band recorded a 16 minute version of "Interstellar Overdrive" and another composition, "Nick's Boogie".<ref name=autogenerated18 /> Whitehead had filmed this recording, which was used in the film, ''Tonite Let's All Make Love in London'' and later on the video release of ''[[London '66<U+2013>'67]]''.<ref name=autogenerated18 /> Whitehead later commented about the band that: "They were just completely welded together, just like a jazz group".<ref name=autogenerated18 />

=====Record deal=====
Boyd attempted to sign the band up with [[Polydor Records]]. However, Morrison had convinced King and Jenner to try to start a bidding war between Polydor and [[EMI]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|pages=31<U+2013>32|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> In February, Boyd produced a recording session for the group,<ref name=autogenerated16 /> with them returning to Sound Techniques in Chelsea again, which resulted in a recording of the single "[[Arnold Layne]]",<ref name=autogenerated17 /><ref name=autogenerated20>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=32|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> and the recording of other songs: "[[Matilda Mother]]", "[[Chapter 24]]", "Interstellar Overdrive"<ref name=autogenerated20 /> and "Let's Roll Another One" (which was renamed to "[[Candy and a Currant Bun]]", at the suggestion of Waters).<ref name=autogenerated20 /> Referring to the choice of "Arnold Layne", Nick Mason said: "We knew we wanted to be rock'n'roll stars and we wanted to make singles, so it seemed the most suitable song to condense into 3 minutes without losing too much".<ref name=autogenerated20 /> After the aforementioned bidding war idea was finished, Pink Floyd signed up with EMI, the deal (unusually at the time) included recording an album,<ref name=autogenerated20 /> which meant the band had unlimited studio time at [[EMI Studios]], in return for a smaller royalty percentage.<ref name=autogenerated20 /> The band then attempted to re-record "Arnold Layne", however, the Boyd version from February was released instead.<ref name=autogenerated20 />

=====''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn''=====
The band's first studio album, ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', was recorded intermittently between February and July 1967 in Studio 3 at Abbey Road Studios, and produced by former Beatles engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=34|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> At the same time, [[The Beatles]] were recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in Studio 2 and the [[Pretty Things]] were recording ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' in Studio 1. 

By the time the album, was released on 4 August, "Arnold Layne" (which was released months eariler, on 11 March) had reached number 20 on the British singles charts<ref name="officialcharts1">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/pink%20floyd/ |title=PINK FLOYD &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |date= |accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> (despite not even being played by Radio London)<ref name=autogenerated20 /> and the follow-up single, "[[See Emily Play]]", had done even better, peaking at number 6.<ref name="officialcharts1"/><ref>[http://www.everyhit.com/ UK Top 40 Hit Database] <U+2013> EveryHit.com</ref> The album became a smash hit in the UK, hitting number 6 on the British album charts.<ref name="officialcharts1"/>

Their first three singles, including their third ("[[Apples and Oranges (song)|Apples and Oranges]]"), were written by Barrett, who also was the principal visionary/author of their critically acclaimed 1967 debut album. Of the eleven songs on ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'', Barrett wrote eight and co-wrote another two.<ref>EMI Records Ltd., "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" insert</ref>

===Barrett's departure from Pink Floyd===
Through late 1967 and early 1968, Barrett's behaviour became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, partly as a consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref name="pal001" /> Many report having seen him on stage with the group, strumming on one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all.<ref name="Econ">{{cite news | last = Economist.com | title = Syd Barrett, obituary | url = http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7188674 | accessdate =18 June 2007 | work=The Economist | date=20 July 2006}}</ref> At a show at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, during a performance of "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on [[Pat Boone]]'s show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a "blank and totally mute stare"; according to Nick Mason, "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day". Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on [[Dick Clark]]'s popular TV show ''[[American Bandstand]]''. When asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, as Clark admitted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed [[Methaqualone|Mandrax]] tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of [[Brylcreem]] into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting,<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=42|edition=1st|accessdate=15 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> making him look like "a guttered candle".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=xv|edition=New|accessdate=18 July 2012|chapter=Wish You Were Here}}</ref> Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that "Syd would never waste good mandies".<ref name="tw009">Willis, Tim. ''Madcap: The Half-Life of Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's Lost Genius'' (Short Books, 2002) ISBN 1-904095-24-0</ref>

During their UK tour with [[Jimi Hendrix]] in November 1967, guitarist [[David O'List]] from [[The Nice]] was called in to substitute for Barrett on several occasions when he was unable to perform or failed to appear. And sometime around Christmas, David Gilmour (Barrett's old school friend) was asked to join the band as a second guitarist to cover for Barrett, whose erratic behaviour prevented him from performing. For a handful of shows Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally deciding to join in playing. The other band members soon grew tired of Barrett's antics and, on 26 January 1968, on the way to a show at [[Southampton University]], the band elected not to pick Barrett up: one person in the car said, "Shall we pick Syd up?" and another said, "Let's not bother."<ref>{{cite news | date=January 1995 | title = Gilmour interview in ''Guitar World'}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Mark|title=Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd|year=2008|publisher=Da Capo|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-306-81752-7|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=112|chapter=The Spaces Between Friends}}</ref><ref name=toby45>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=45|edition=1st|accessdate=15 July 2012|chapter=The Underground}}</ref> As Barrett had, up until then, written the overwhelming bulk of the band's material the initial plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member&nbsp;<U+2014> as [[The Beach Boys]] had done with [[Brian Wilson]]&nbsp;<U+2014> but this soon proved to be impractical.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=265|edition=New|accessdate=18 July 2012|chapter=Apples and Oranges}}</ref><ref name=toby45 />

According to Roger Waters, Barrett came into what was to be their last practice session with a new song he had dubbed "[[Have You Got It, Yet?]]". The song seemed simple enough when he first presented it to his bandmates, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn and they eventually realised that while they were practising it, Barrett kept changing the arrangement.<ref name=toby45 /> He would then play it again, with the arbitrary changes, and sing "Have you got it yet?". Eventually they realised they never would and that they were simply bearing the brunt of Barrett's [[idiosyncratic]] sense of humour.<ref name="tp001">DiLorenzo, Kris. "Syd Barrett: Careening Through Life." ''Trouser Press'' February 1978 pp. 26<U+2013>32 [http://www.schizophrenia.com/stories/sbarrett.htm]</ref> Waters had called it "a real act of mad genius".<ref name=toby45 />

Barrett did not contribute material to the band after ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'' was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'', only one ("[[Jugband Blues]]") made it to the band's second album; one ("Apples and Oranges") became a less-than-successful single, and two others ("[[Scream Thy Last Scream]]" and "[[Vegetable Man]]") were never officially released. Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on "[[Remember a Day]]" (which had been first attempted during ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' sessions), and also played on "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]".<ref>1993 ''[[Guitar World]]'' interview with David Gilmour</ref> On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member of Pink Floyd, the same day, the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated.<ref name=toby45 />

===Solo years (1968<U+2013>72)===
After leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett distanced himself from the public eye. At the behest of EMI and [[Harvest Records]], he embarked on a brief solo career, releasing two solo albums, ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'' and ''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]''. For some songs: "[[Terrapin (song)|Terrapin]]", "Maisie" and "[[Bob Dylan's Blues|Bob Dylan Blues]]"; had Barrett recalling his early interest in blues.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|edition=1st|accessdate=9 July 2012|page=9|chapter=The Early Years}}</ref>

====''The Madcap Laughs''====
{{Main|The Madcap Laughs}}
After Barrett left Pink Floyd in April 1968, Peter Jenner from the band's management, followed suit. Jenner lead Barrett into EMI Studios to record some tracks in May, that would later be released on Barrett's first solo album<U+2014>''[[The Madcap Laughs]]''.<ref name=autogenerated21>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=70|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> By the sessions of June and July, most of the tracks were in better shape, however, shortly after the July sessions, Barrett was in a mess of a state, apparently, breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Corner and then going off on a drive around Britain in his mini, ending up in psychiatric care in Cambridge.<ref name=autogenerated22>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=71|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> During New Year 1969, a somewhat recovered Barrett, had taken up the tenancy in flat on Egerton Road, [[Earls Court]], London, with artist [[Duggie Fields]].<ref name=autogenerated22 /><ref>{{cite web|author=BdF, bdeflorence@yahoo.co.uk |url=http://www.duggiefields.com/text/text_index.htm |title=Prose (search for 'Mick Rock's') |publisher=Duggie Fields |date= |accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> Here, Barrett's flat was so close to that of Gilmour's, that Gilmour could actually see right into Barrett's kitchen.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> Decided upon to return to a musical career, Barrett contacted EMI, and was passed on to Malcolm Jones, the then-head of EMI's new [[Progressive rock|prog rock]] label, [[Harvest Records|Harvest]].<ref name=autogenerated22 /> 

The Jones-produced sessions start in April 1969 at EMI Studios.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> After the first of these sessions, Barrett brought in friends of his to the next: [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]] drummer, [[Jerry Shirley]] and Joker's Wild (Gilmour's old band) drummer, Willie Wilson, for the sessions, Gilmour himself played bass.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> Talking to Barrett wasn't easy, said Jones: "It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind".<ref name=autogenerated22 /> A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of the band [[Soft Machine]].<ref name=autogenerated13 /> During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder [[Kevin Ayers]]' debut LP ''[[Joy of a Toy]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-harvest-years-1969-1974-mw0002337660 |title=The Harvest Years 1969-1974 - Kevin Ayers : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=23 April 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> although his performance on "Religious Experience" was not released until the album was reissued in 2003.<ref name=autogenerated13 /><ref name=autogenerated31>{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Julian|title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe|year=2010|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0859654311|edition=Rev.|accessdate=17 July 2012|page=362|chapter=Within the Dark Globe}}</ref> One time, Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off "for an afternoon drive", however, he followed Pink Floyd to [[Ibiza]] (according to legend, he skipped check-ins and customs, ran onto the runway and attempted to flag down a jet).<ref name=autogenerated22 /> One of his friends later spotted him on a beach wearing messed-up clothes and with a carrier bag, that was full of money.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> At this point, during the trip, Barrett had asked Gilmour for his help in the recording sessions.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> 

After two of the Gilmour (with Waters)-produced sessions,<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|first=David|title=Random Precision: Recording the Music of Syd Barrett, 1965<U+2013>1974|year=2001|publisher=Cherry Red Books|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=iv}}</ref> they had remade one track from The Soft Machine's overdubs, and recorded three tracks.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> These sessions came to a minor halt when Gilmour and Waters were mixing Pink Floyd's then-newly recorded album, ''[[Ummagumma]]'', against Barrett's dismay.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> However, through and up to the end of July, they managed to record three more tracks.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> The problem with the recording was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them "live" in studio. On the released versions a number of them have false starts and commentaries from Barrett.<ref name=autogenerated22 /> Despite being more complete and better produced, Gilmour and Waters left the Jones-produced track, "Opel" off of ''Madcap''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|pages=71<U+2013>72|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> 

Gilmour, on the sessions for ''The Madcap Laughs'':
{{Quote| "[Sessions] were pretty tortuous and very rushed. We had very little time, particularly with ''The Madcap Laughs''. Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, its your fucking career, mate. Why don't you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do." | [[David Gilmour]]|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t3136-david-gilmour-record-collector-may.html|title=David Gilmour: Record Collector, May 2003 - All Pink Floyd Fan Network|publisher=Pinkfloydfan.net|date=10 January 2001|accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>}}

Upon release in January 1970, Jones was shocked by it: "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind".<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=72|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> Gilmour said: "Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like. But perhaps we were trying to punish him".<ref name=autogenerated23>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=72|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> Waters was more optimistic: "Syd is a genius".<ref name=autogenerated23 />

====''Barrett''====
{{Main|Barrett (album)}}
The second album, ''Barrett'', was recorded more sporadically than the first,<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Nick|title=The Dark Stuff: Selected Writings on Rock Music|year=2007|publisher=Faber & Faber, Limited|accessdate=6 July 2012|page=121}}</ref> with sessions taking place between February and July 1970.<ref name=autogenerated23 /><ref name=B2010_1-2>{{cite album-notes|title=Barrett|albumlink=Barrett (album)|artist=Syd Barrett|year=[[Harvest]]|pages=1<U+2013>2|type=booklet|publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> The album was produced by [[David Gilmour]] and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]],<ref name=autogenerated23 /><ref name=autogenerated25>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=61|edition=1st|accessdate=10 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Wright on keyboard and [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]] drummer [[Jerry Shirley]].<ref name=autogenerated23 /> The first songs were attempted as a go for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track.<ref name=autogenerated23 /> However, Gilmour thought they were losing the "Barrett-ness".<ref name=autogenerated23 /> One track ("Rats") was originally record as Barrett on his own and that would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos.<ref name=autogenerated23 /> Shirley said of Barrett's playing: "He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic."<ref name=autogenerated23 /> At times Barrett would say: "Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it's too windy and icy".<ref name=autogenerated23 />

These sessions were happening while Pink Floyd had just begun to work on ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''.<ref name=autogenerated23 /> On various occasion, Barrett went to "spy" on the band as they recorded their album.<ref name=autogenerated23 />

Wright said of the ''Barrett'' sessions:
{{Quote| Doing Syd's record was interesting, but extremely difficult. Dave [Gilmour] and [[Roger Waters|Roger]] did the first one (''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'') and Dave and myself did the second one. But by then it was just trying to help Syd any way we could, rather than worrying about getting the best guitar sound. You could forget about that! It was just going into the studio and trying to get him to sing. |[[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t7597-rick-wright-broken-china-interview.html |title=Rick Wright: Broken China Interview - Aug 1996 - All Pink Floyd Fan Network |publisher=Pinkfloydfan.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref>}}

====Performances====
Despite the numerous recording dates for his two solo albums, Barrett undertook very little musical activity between 1968 and 1972 outside the studio. On 24 February 1970, he appeared on [[John Peel]]'s [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] radio programme ''[[Top Gear (Music show)|Top Gear]]''<ref name=autogenerated23 /> playing five songs<U+2014>only one of which had been previously released. Three would be re-recorded for the ''Barrett'' album, while the song "Two of a Kind" was a one-off performance (the song appears on the 2001 compilation ''[[The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?]]'') with the lyrics and composition having since been credited to Richard Wright. Barrett was accompanied on this session by David Gilmour and Jerry Shirley who played bass and percussion,<ref name=autogenerated23 /> respectively (these five songs were originally released on ''[[The Peel Session (Syd Barrett album)|Syd Barrett: The Peel Session]]'').

Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one and only live concert during this period.<ref name=autogenerated25 /> The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall, London, and was part of a ''Music and Fashion Festival''. The trio performed four songs,<ref name=autogenerated25 /> playing for less than half an hour, and because of poor mixing, the vocals were barely audible until part-way through the last number. At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off the stage.<ref name=autogenerated25 /> Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio, recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971 (these three songs, along with the five from the ''Top Gear'' performance, were released on ''[[The Radio One Sessions (Syd Barrett album)|Syd Barrett: The Radio One Sessions]]''). All three came from the ''Barrett'' album. After this session, he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an extensive interview with [[Mick Rock]] and ''Rolling Stone'' in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about touring with [[Jimi Hendrix]], and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with.<ref name="rs009">{{cite news |first=Mick |last=Rock |authorlink=Mick Rock |coauthors= |title=The Madcap Who Named Pink Floyd |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10829789/the_madcap_who_named_pink_floyd/|quote=If you tend to believe what you hear, rather than what is, Syd Barrett is either dead, behind bars, or a vegetable.

===Later years (1972<U+2013>2006)===
====Stars and final recordings====
In February 1972, after a few guest spots in Cambridge with ex<U+2013>[[Pink Fairies]] member [[Twink (musician)|Twink]] on drums and [[Jack Monck]] on bass using the name The Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band (backing visiting blues musician [[Eddie "Guitar" Burns]] and also featuring Henry Cow guitarist [[Fred Frith]]), the trio formed a short-lived band called [[Stars (British band)|Stars]].<ref name=autogenerated26>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=74|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> Though the band was initially well received at gigs in the Dandelion coffee bar and the town's Market Square, one of their gigs at the [[Cambridge Corn Exchange|Corn Exchange]] in [[Cambridge]] with the MC5 proved to be disastrous.<ref name=autogenerated24>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=73|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Set the Controls}}</ref> A few days after this final show, Twink recalled that Barrett stopped him on the street, showed him a scathing review of the gig they had played, and quit on the spot<ref name=autogenerated24 /> despite having played at least one subsequent gig at the same venue supporting Nektar.<ref name="tw009" /> A tape of the Eddie "Guitar" Burns gig surfaced recently but has yet to see a commercial release though brief snippets have appeared on the internet. Similarly, all the Stars shows were recorded but the tapes are considered lost. The tenuous Pink Fairies connection is continued with the appearance of Barrett on at least one track, possibly more, on a posthumous release by founder Fairy and ex Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist [[Steve Peregrin Took]] alongside assorted members of the Pink Fairies and Took's own band [[Shagrat (band)|Shagrat]].

Syd attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by Pete Brown and former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]] in October 1973. Brown arrived at the show late, and saw that Bruce was already onstage, along with "a guitarist I vaguely recognised", playing the [[Horace Silver]] tune "Doodlin'". Later in the show, Brown read out a poem, which he dedicated to Syd, because, "he's here in Cambridge, and he's one of the best songwriters in the country" when, to his surprise, the guitar player from earlier in the show stood up and said, "No I'm not".<ref>{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Julian|title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe|year=2010|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0859654311|edition=Rev.|accessdate=|page=401|chapter=The Return of Ulysses}}</ref>

By the end of 1973, Syd had returned to live in London, staying at various hotels and, in December of that year, getting accommodation at Chelsea Cloisters. He had little contact with others, apart from his regular visits to his management's offices to collect his royalties,<ref name=autogenerated26 /> and the occasional visit from sister Rosemary.

In November 1974,<ref name=autogenerated26 /> [[Peter Jenner]] persuaded Barrett to return to [[Abbey Road Studios]] in hope of recording another album. According to [[John Leckie]], who engineered these sessions, even at this point Syd still "looked like he did when he was younger..long haired".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|first=David|title=Random Precision: Recording the Music of Syd Barrett, 1965<U+2013>1974|year=2001|publisher=Cherry Red Books|accessdate=22 July 2012|page=194}}</ref> Little became of the sessions, which lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs (the only titled track is "If You Go, Don't Be Slow"). Once again, Barrett withdrew from the music industry. He sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label and moved into a London hotel. During this period, several attempts to employ him as a record producer (including one by [[Jamie Reid]] on behalf of the [[Sex Pistols]], and another by [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], who wanted him to produce [[Music for Pleasure (The Damned album)|their second album]]), were all fruitless.<ref name="autogenerated1993">{{cite book|last=Watkinson|first=Mike|title=Crazy Diamond: Syd Barrett & the Dawn of Pink Floyd|year=2001|publisher=Omnibus|location=London|isbn=0-7119-8835-8|pages=121<U+2013>122|edition=New|coauthors=Anderson, Pete|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=213|edition=New|accessdate24 July 2012|chapter=Pigs on the Wing}}</ref>

====Withdrawal to Cambridge====
In 1978, when Barrett's money ran out, he moved back to Cambridge to live with his mother. He returned to live in London again in 1982, but this only lasted a few weeks, and he soon returned to Cambridge for good. Legend has it, and his sister confirms, that Barrett walked the 50 miles from London to Cambridge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Julian|title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe|year=2010|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965-431-1|edition=Rev.|accessdate=5 July 2012|page=414|chapter=The Return of Ulysses}}</ref> Until his death, Barrett still received royalties from his work with Pink Floyd from each compilation and some of the live albums and singles that featured his songs. Gilmour commented that he (Gilmour) "[made] sure the money [got] to him all right".<ref name="cambridge-news2006">{{cite news | url = http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_cambridge/displayarticle.asp?id=288359 | publisher=Cambridge Evening News | date = 11 November 2006 | title = Barrett leaves <U+00A3>1.25m | accessdate =25 April 2008 }}</ref>

In 1996, Barrett was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Pink Floyd. Barrett did not attend the ceremony.<ref>{{cite book|last=Povey|first=Glenn|title=Echoes - The Complete History of Pink Floyd|year=2007|publisher=Mind Head Publishing|isbn=978-0-9554624-0-5|page=286}}</ref> 

According to a 2005 profile by biographer Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to his original art-form of painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also said to have been an avid gardener. His main point of contact with the outside world was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/the_madness_and_majesty_of_pink_floyd| work=Rolling Stone | date=5 April 2007 | title = The Madness and Majesty of Pink Floyd | first = Mikal | last = Gilmore}}</ref>

Although Barrett had not appeared or spoken in public since the mid-1970s, time did little to diminish interest in his life and work. Reporters and fans still travelled to Cambridge to seek him out, despite his attempts to live a quiet life and public appeals from his family for people to leave him alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/barrett/ianintw.htm |title=Set The Controls; Interview to Roger 'Syd' Barrett's Nephew |publisher=Pink-floyd.org |date=22 April 2001 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> Many photos of Barrett being annoyed by [[paparazzi]] when walking or biking, from the 1980s until his death in 2006, have been published in various media. Apparently, Barrett did not like being reminded about his past as a musician and the other members of Pink Floyd had no direct contact with him. He did go to his sister's house in November 2001 to watch the BBC ''Omnibus'' documentary made about him <U+2013> reportedly he found some of it "a bit noisy", enjoyed seeing Mike Leonard of Leonard's Lodgers again, calling him his 'teacher', and enjoyed hearing "[[See Emily Play]]" again.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,804928,00.html | work=The Observer | date = 6 October 2002 | title = You shone like the sun | accessdate =17 February 2007 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Willis}}</ref>

==Legacy==
===''Wish You Were Here'' sessions===
[[File:Syd Barrett Abbey Road 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Syd Barrett, visiting [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 5 June 1975.]]
Barrett had one noted reunion with the members of Pink Floyd, which occurred in 1975 during the recording sessions for ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''. He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band record "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" <U+2014> a song that happened to be about Barrett. By that time, the 29-year-old Barrett had become quite overweight, had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his ex-bandmates did not at first recognise him. Eventually, they realised who he was. Barrett's behaviour at the session was erratic; he spent part of the session brushing his teeth while standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydbarrett.net/subpages/articles/syd_barrett_story_by_syd_and_tho.htm |title=The Syd Barrett story |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Julian|title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe|year=2010|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965-431-1|edition=Rev.|accessdate=5 July 2012|page=408|chapter=The Return of Ulysses}}</ref> Roger Waters finally managed to ask him what he thought of the song and he simply said "sounds a bit old".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He briefly attended the reception for Gilmour's wedding to [[Ginger Gilmour|Ginger]] which immediately followed the recording sessions; however, he left early without saying goodbye.

Apart from a brief encounter between Waters and Barrett in [[Harrods]] a couple of years later<ref name=autogenerated24 /><ref>{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Julian|title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe|year=2010|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965-431-1|edition=Rev.|accessdate=5 July 2012|page=412|chapter=The Return of Ulysses}}</ref> (of which, when Barrett saw Waters he ran outside, dropping his bags full of sweets in the process).<ref name=autogenerated24 /> This was the last time any member of Pink Floyd saw him. There is a reflection on the day in Nick Mason's book ''Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd''. A reference to this reunion also appears in the film ''[[Pink Floyd<U+2014>The Wall|The Wall]]'', where the character [[Pink Floyd (fictional character)|Pink]], played by [[Bob Geldof]], shaves his body hair after having a mental breakdown, just as Barrett had.

===Compilations===
In 1988, EMI Records (after constant pressure from Malcolm Jones)<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Julian|title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe|year=2010|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965-431-1|edition=Rev.|accessdate=5 July 2012|page=419|chapter=Home}}</ref> released an album of Barrett's studio out-takes and previously unreleased material recorded from 1968 to 1970 under the title ''[[Opel (album)|Opel]]''. The disc was originally set to include the unreleased Barrett Pink Floyd songs "Scream Thy Last Scream" and "Vegetable Man", which had been remixed for the album by Jones.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> However, the two songs were pulled (by Pink Floyd)<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=186|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Floyd's Finest 50}}</ref> before ''Opel'' was finalised.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|pages=116<U+2013>117|edition=New|accessdate=18 July 2012|chapter=The Thin Ice}}</ref>

In 1993 EMI issued another release, ''[[Crazy Diamond]]'', a box set of all three albums, each with further out-takes from his solo sessions that illustrated Barrett's inability or refusal to play a song the same way twice. EMI also released ''[[The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?]]'' in the UK on 16 April 2001, and in the US on 11 September 2001. This was the first time his song "[[Bob Dylan's Blues|Bob Dylan Blues]]" was ever officially released, taken from a demo tape that David Gilmour had kept after an early 1970s recording session. Gilmour still has the tape, which also contains the unreleased "Living Alone" from the ''Barrett'' sessions.<ref name="rp001">Parker, David. ''Random Precision: Recording the Music of Syd Barrett 1965<U+2013>1974'' (Cherry Red, 2003) ISBN 1-901447-25-1</ref> The 2010 compilation ''[[An Introduction to Syd Barrett]]'' includes the downloadable bonus track "Rhamadan", a 20 minute track recorded at one of Syd's earliest solo sessions, in May 1968. In October 2010 Harvest/EMI and Capitol Records released ''An Introduction to Syd Barrett''<U+2014>a collection of both his Pink Floyd and remastered solo work. In 2011, it was announced that a vinyl double album version would be issued for [[Record Store Day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to Syd Barrett Ltd. 2LP Vinyl Coming for Record Store Day|url=http://www.crawdaddy.com/index.php/2011/02/23/introduction-to-syd-barrett-ltd-2lp-vinyl-coming-for-record-store-day/|publisher=[[Crawdaddy!]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|author=Howard Wyman|date=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Syd-Barrett-An-Introduction-To-Syd-Barrett/release/2831206 |title=Syd Barrett - An Introduction To Syd Barrett (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref>

A number of [[Pink Floyd bootleg recordings|bootleg]] LPs, CDs and other recordings of Barrett's live and solo material exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pf-roio.de/ |title=Pink Floyd RoIO Database Homepage |publisher=Pf-roio.de |date=1994-05-17 |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Marooned |url=http://www.echoeshub.com/recordings/index.php?search=Search&q=Pink+Floyd |title=RoIO Audience/Soundboard Concert Database |publisher=Echoeshub.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> For years the "off air" recordings of the BBC sessions with Barrett's Pink Floyd circulated, until an engineer who had taken a tape of the early Pink Floyd gave it back to the BBC<U+2014>which played it during a tribute to [[John Peel]] on their website.

This show featured 1967 live versions of "[[Flaming (song)|Flaming]]", "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]", and a brief 90-second snippet of the instrumental "[[Reaction in G]]". In 2012, engineer Andy Jackson said he had found "a huge box of assorted tapes", in Mason's possession, containing versions of R&B songs that (the Barrett-era) Pink Floyd played in their early years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Gary|title=Pink Floyd Mulling More Reissues After Expanded 'Wall' Releases|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/pink-floyd-mulling-more-reissues-after-expanded-1006126752.story|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=Detroit|date=8 February 2012}}</ref>

===Creative impact and technical innovation===
[[File:BarrettHarmonyGuitar.jpg|thumb|280px||Barrett's first acoustic guitar]]
[[File:Syd Barrett Guitar .jpg|thumb|180px||Mirrored Fender Esquire]]
Barrett wrote most of Pink Floyd's early material. He was also an innovative guitarist, using [[extended techniques]] and exploring the musical and sonic possibilities of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]], [[distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], the [[echo machine]], tapes and other effects; his experimentation was partly inspired by free improvisation guitarist with the group AMM, active at the time in London, [[Keith Rowe]].<ref>Palacios, Julian (2010).''Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd: Dark Globe''. London: Plexus Publishing Ltd, ISBN 978-0-85965-431-9, p101</ref> One of Barrett's trademarks was playing his guitar through an old echo box while sliding a [[Zippo lighter]] up and down the fret-board to create the mysterious, otherworldly sounds that became associated with the group. Barrett was known to have used [[Binson]] delay units to achieve his trademark echo sounds. [[Daevid Allen]], founder member of [[Soft Machine]] and [[Gong (band)|Gong]] has cited Barrett's use of slide guitar with echo as a key inspiration for his own "glissando guitar" style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetgong.co.uk/outland/wiki/pmwiki.php/MizMaze/DaevidAllen |title=Gong Family Maze &#124; MizMaze / DaevidAllen |publisher=Planetgong.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>

Barrett's free-form sequences of sonic carpets pioneered a new way to play the rock guitar.<ref name="Den001">Denyer, Ralph (1992). ''The Guitar Handbook''. London: Dorling Kindersley Ltd. ISBN 0-679-74275-1, p 23</ref> He played several different guitars during his tenure with Pink Floyd, including an old [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] hollowbody electric, a Harmony acoustic, a Fender acoustic, a single-coil [[Danelectro 59 DC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en%2Dus/Lifestyle/Features/68flashbackhowpinkfloyd/ |title='68 Flashback: How Pink Floyd Found Their Future and Lost Psychedelic Genius Syd Barrett in A Saucerful of Secrets |publisher=Gibson.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> several different [[Fender Telecaster]]s, and a white [[Fender Stratocaster]] used in late 1967. A silver [[Fender Esquire]] with mirrored discs glued to the body was the guitar he was most often associated with and the guitar he "felt most close to."<ref name="rs009" />

===Musical and pop culture influence===
Many artists have acknowledged Barrett's influence on their work. [[Paul McCartney]],<ref name=autogenerated27>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=246|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Solo Projects}}</ref> [[Pete Townshend]],<ref name=autogenerated27 /> [[Blur (band)|Blur]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aQIWDwhkFQ |title=Blur's Graham Coxon on Syd Barrett |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated32>[http://www.pinkfloydz.com/artqmagsydjan2004.htm Pink Floyd - Syd Barrett Article - Q Magazine January 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Kevin Ayers]],<ref name=autogenerated28>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=285|edition=1st|accessdate=12 July 2012|chapter=Pink Floyd tributes}}</ref> [[Gong (band)|Gong]],<ref name=autogenerated28 /> [[Marc Bolan]],<ref name=autogenerated29>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=286|edition=1st|accessdate=11 July 2012|chapter=Pink Floyd tributes}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated32 /> [[Tangerine Dream]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|pages=285<U+2013>286|edition=1st|accessdate=12 July 2012|chapter=Pink Floyd tributes}}</ref> [[Julian Cope]]<ref name=autogenerated30>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|page=287|edition=1st|accessdate=12 July 2012|chapter=Pink Floyd tributes}}</ref> and [[David Bowie]]<ref name=autogenerated29 /><ref name=autogenerated32 /> were early fans; [[Jimmy Page]],<ref name="luckymojo1">{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/barrett/refs/7404express.html |title=CRACKED BALLAD OF SYD BARRETT - 1974 |publisher=Luckymojo.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> [[Brian Eno]],<ref name="luckymojo1"/> and [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]<ref name="autogenerated1993"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=214|edition=New|accessdate24 July 2012|chapter=Pigs on the Wing}}</ref> all expressed interest in working with him at some point during the 1970s. Bowie recorded a cover of "[[See Emily Play]]" on his 1973 album ''[[Pin Ups]]''. The track "Grass", from [[XTC]]'s album ''[[Skylarking]]'' was influenced when [[Andy Partridge]] let fellow band member [[Colin Moulding]] borrow his Barrett records.<ref name=autogenerated30 /> [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s career was dedicated to being Barrett-esque; he played "Dominoes" for the BBC's documentary [[The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story]].<ref name=autogenerated30 />

Barrett's decline had a profound effect on Roger Waters' songwriting, and the theme of mental illness permeated Pink Floyd's later albums, particularly 1973's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and 1975's ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' which was a deliberate and affectionate tribute to Barrett, the song, "Shine On You Crazy Diamond",<ref>{{cite video|year=2003|title=[[The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story]]|format=DVD|medium=Documentary|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The title track borrows imagery of a "steel rail" from Barrett's solo song, "If It's In You," from ''The Madcap Laughs'' album.

In 1987, an album of Barrett cover songs called ''[[Beyond the Wildwood]]'' was released. The album collected songs from Barrett's Pink Floyd albums and his solo albums. Artists appearing were UK and US [[indie band]]s including [[The Shamen]], [[Opal (band)|Opal]], [[The Soup Dragons]], and [[Plasticland]].

Other artists who have written tributes to Barrett include his contemporary [[Kevin Ayers]], who wrote "O Wot a Dream" in his honour (Barrett provided guitar to an early version of Ayers' song "Religious Experience: Singing a Song in the Morning").<ref name=autogenerated13 /><ref name=autogenerated31 /> [[Robyn Hitchcock]] has covered many of his songs live and on record, and has paid homage to his forebear with the songs "The Man Who Invented Himself" and "(Feels Like) 1974". Phish has covered "Bike", "No Good Trying", "Love You", "Baby Lemonade", and "Terrapin". The [[Television Personalities (band)|Television Personalities]]' track "I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives" from their 1981 album ''And Don't the Kids Love It'' is another tribute. (The Television Personalities became the subject of controversy and derision when, as they had been selected as the opening act on Gilmour's ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'' tour in the early 1980s, lead singer [[Dan Treacy]] decided to read aloud Barrett's real home address to the audience of thousands. Gilmour removed them from the tour immediately afterwards.)<ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=123|edition=New|accessdate=18 July 2012|chapter=Shine On You Crazy Diamond}}</ref> In 2008, [[The Trash Can Sinatras]] released a single in tribute to the life and work of Syd Barrett called "Oranges and Apples", from their 2009 album ''In The Music''. Proceeds from the single go to the Syd Barrett Trust in support of arts in mental health.

Barrett is also portrayed briefly in the opening scene of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (play)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' (2006), performing "Golden Hair". His life and music, including the disastrous [[Syd Barrett#Later years (1972<U+2013>2006)|Cambridge Corn Exchange concert]] and his later reclusive lifestyle, are a recurring motif in the work.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stoppard |first=Tom |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/11/stoppard200711 |title=Here's Looking at You, Syd &#124; Culture |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=21 March 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573545/rock-n-roll-syd-barrett-on-broadway-by-kurt-loder.jhtml |title='Rock 'N' Roll': Syd Barrett On Broadway, By Kurt Loder - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sean O'Hagan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/jul/30/theatre.sydbarrett |title=Theatre: Rock'n'Roll &#124; Stage &#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> Barrett died during the play's run in London.

===Mental state===
There has been much speculation concerning Barrett's psychological well-being. Many believe he suffered from [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="tp001"/><ref name="rst001">{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Greene |authorlink=Andy Greene |coauthors= |title=Founding frontman and songwriter for Pink Floyd dead at 60 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10830377/syd_barrett_19462006 |quote=The next year, following a highly successful tour with Jimi Hendrix, Barrett's mental state began to deteriorate&nbsp;...

In an article published in 2006, in response to notions that Barrett's problems were the result of such, Gilmour was quoted as saying: "In my opinion, his nervous breakdown would have happened anyway. It was a deep-rooted thing. But I'll say the [[psychedelic experience]] might well have acted as a catalyst. Still, I just don't think he could deal with the vision of success and all the things that went with it."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/syd-barrett-the-swinging-60-521928.html |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 7 January 2006 | accessdate =1 July 2010 | title = Syd Barrett, the swinging 60 }}</ref> Many stories of Barrett's erratic behaviour off stage as well as on are also well-documented. In ''Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey'', author [[Nicholas Schaffner]] interviewed a number of people who knew Barrett before and during his Pink Floyd days. These included friends Peter and Susan Wynne-Wilson, artist [[Duggie Fields]] (with whom Barrett shared a flat during the late 1960s), June Bolan and [[Storm Thorgerson]], among others. On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly, across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house.<ref name=autogenerated24 />

"For June Bolan, the alarm bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under lock and key for three days, occasionally shoving a ration of biscuits under the door."<ref>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=77|edition=New|accessdate=18 July 2012|chapter=Games for May}}</ref> A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic [[Jonathan Meades]]. "I went [to Barrett's flat] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a [[bad trip]]. We put him in the linen cupboard'".<ref name=autogenerated33>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Nicholas|title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|location=London|isbn=1-905139-09-8|page=110|edition=New|accessdate=18 July 2012|chapter=Paranoid Eyes}}</ref> Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself."<ref name=autogenerated33 /> In the book ''Crazy Diamond: Syd Barrett and the Dawn of Pink Floyd'', authors Mike Watkinson and Pete Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin".<ref>{{cite book|last=Watkinson|first=Mike|title=Crazy Diamond: Syd Barrett & the Dawn of Pink Floyd|year=2001|publisher=Omnibus|location=London|isbn=0-7119-8835-8|page=83|edition=New|coauthors=Anderson, Pete|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>  According to Gilmour in an interview with [[Nick Kent]], the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist [[R. D. Laing]] with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him "incurable".<ref>Kent, Nick. Syd Barrett feature.

After Barrett died, his sister, Rosemary Breen, spoke to biographer Tim Willis for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]''. She insisted that Barrett neither suffered from mental illness nor received treatment for it at any time since they resumed regular contact in the 1980s.<ref name="wil002">{{cite news | last = Willis | first = Tim | title = My lovably ordinary brother Syd | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | date = 16 July 2007 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article688189.ece | accessdate =12 May 2007 | location=London}}</ref> She allowed that he did spend some time in a private "home for lost souls" <U+2014> Greenwoods in Essex<U+2014>but claimed there was no formal therapy programme there. Some years later, Barrett apparently agreed to sessions with a psychiatrist at [[Fulbourn Hospital|Fulbourn psychiatric hospital]] in Cambridge, but Breen claimed that neither medication nor therapy was considered appropriate in her brother's case.<ref name="wil002" /> His sister denied he was a recluse or that he was vague about his past: "Roger may have been a bit selfish <U+2014> or rather self-absorbed <U+2014> but when people called him a recluse they were really only projecting their own disappointment. He knew what they wanted, but he wasn't willing to give it to them." Barrett, she said, took up photography and sometimes they went to the seaside together. "Quite often he took the train on his own to London to look at the major art collections <U+2014> and he loved flowers. He made regular trips to the Botanic Gardens and to the [[dahlia]]s at [[Anglesey Abbey]], near [[Lode, Cambridgeshire|Lode]]. But of course, his passion was his painting", she said.<ref name="wil002" /><ref name="wil001">{{cite news | last = Willis | first = Tim | title = You shone like the sun |work=The Observer |location=UK | date = 6 October 2002 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,804928,00.html | accessdate =27 July 2007}}</ref>

==Commemoration and recent events==
An auction of Barrett's house contents at Cheffins auction house in Cambridge on 28 November 2006 raised <U+00A3>119,000 for charity. Items sold included paintings, scrapbooks and everyday items that Barrett had decorated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/6157967.stm | publisher=BBC | date = 29 November 2006 | title = Barrett paintings fetch thousands | accessdate =28 January 2008 }}</ref>

A series of events called ''The City Wakes''<ref>http://www.thecitywakes.org.uk/index.htm {{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> was held in Cambridge in October 2008 to celebrate Barrett's life, art and music. Barrett's sister, Rosemary Breen, supported this, the first-ever series of official events in memory of her brother.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_cambridge/displayarticle.asp?id=331851 | publisher=Cambridge Evening News | date = 17 July 2008 | title = Plea for memories of Floyd rocker | accessdate =25 July 2008 }}</ref> After the success of ''The City Wakes'' festival in 2008, arts charity Escape Artists announced plans to create a centre in Cambridge, using art to help people suffering from mental health problems. The charity has set up a trust to raise money for the centre and has started fundraising by auctioning a mosaic designed by Syd while he was a teenager growing up in Cambridge. The glass mosaic of two warriors was donated by Rosemary Breen, who was keen to help others affected by the problems that plagued her brother until his death in 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_cambridge/displayarticle.asp?id=390011 | publisher=Cambridge Evening News | date = 17 July 2008 | title =Project in Syd's memory | accessdate =20 February 2009 }}</ref>

In March 2011 the book [http://barrettbook.com/ Barrett: The Definitive Visual Companion to the Life of Syd Barrett] was published by Essential Works, as authorised by the Barrett family. This large format illustrated book collected and catalogued for the first time all of Barrett's existing paintings and artworks along with photographs by Barrett himself, many of his letters and many unseen and rare photographs of Barrett and Pink Floyd. The book was said to show that 'Barrett's work evinces the true emotive quality of a real artist, a passion that's evident even in a simple illustration of a turtle'<ref name="Goldmine review of Barrett book">{{cite news|last=Gillian|first=Gaar|title=Barrett|url=http://www.goldminemag.com|newspaper=Goldmine magazine|date=1/11/2011}}</ref> Germany's S<U+00FC>ddeutsche Zeitung suggested "this book is a sensation&nbsp;...
