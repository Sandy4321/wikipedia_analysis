The '''East India Film Company''' was the first Indian film company to screen a movie at an International Film Festival.  Started in 1932 in [[Calcutta]] by R. L. Khemka, it went on to be a pioneer in producing films across four regional film industries, namely [[Bengali cinema|Bengali]], [[Hindi cinema|Hindi]], [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], and [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] in the decade after its founding, till then production companies were restricted regionally.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indian film|author=Erik Barnouw |authorlink=Erik Barnouw|coauthors=[[S.

==History==
The company was formed in 1932 by R. L. Khemka, a local businessman, after acquiring the [[RCA Photophone]] studio, its location recording equipment, and its [[Mitchell Camera]]s. In 1933, East India Film Company's first Bengali production, ''Jamuna Puline'' was released, with Priyanath Ganguli as the director after he left the [[Madan Theatre]]. Riding on its success, the company became the first Bengali studio to venture into not just Hindi but also various [[South India]]n languages.  East India Film Company was soon producing a dozen movie releases per year, including several hits like ''Ramayan'' (Tamil) and ''Savithri'' (Telugu).<ref name=beng>{{cite book |title=Bengali Cinema: An Other Nation|author=Sharmistha Gooptu|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2010|isbn=0415570069 |page=69 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pzEdHF5UYcMC&pg=PA69&dq=%22East+India+Film+Company%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22East%20India%20Film%20Company%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false |ref=Ben }}</ref>

The East India Film Company's ''[[Seeta (1934 film)|Seeta]]'', made by [[Debaki Bose]], was the first [[talkie]] shown in an international film festival when it was shown in 1934 at the [[Venice Film Festival]], where it won an honorary diploma.<ref name="SoManyCinemas">{{cite book |title=So many cinemas: the motion picture in India|author=Bhagwan Das Garg|publisher=Eminence Designs|year=1996|isbn=819006021X |page=86 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wXRZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22East+India+Film+Company%22+-inpublisher:icon&dq=%22East+India+Film+Company%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=4}}</ref> Subsequently, Bose also made his noted film, ''Sonar Sansar'' (Hindi: Sunhera Sansar) in 1936 under the East India Film Company banner.<ref>{{cite book |title=70 years of Indian cinema, 1913-1983|author=T.

Shot in [[Calcutta]] on a lavish budget of Rs.75,000, East India Film Company's ''Sati Savithri'' was a huge hit. Based on a popular stage play by Mylavaram Bala Bharathi Samajam, the film was directed by debutant [[C. Pullaiah]] and starred stage stalwarts [[Vemuri Gaggiah]] and [[Dasari Ramathilakam]] as Yama and Savithri, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/article871376.ece|title=SATI SAVITHRI (1933)|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=November 7, 2010|last=Narasimham|first=M.
