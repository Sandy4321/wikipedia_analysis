== History ==
{{main|History of the euro}}

Legally, both the European Central Bank and the NCBs of the [[eurozone]] countries' National Central Banks have received the right to issue the 7 different euro notes from the ECB. In practice, the NCBs of the zone issue and withdraw euro notes. The European Central Bank does not own an office containing cash and has not been involved in any operations involving cash.<ref name="Introduction" />

=== Before the introduction ===
The euro was founded at the date of 1 January 1999, after which it began being the currency of over 300 million Europeans.<ref name="Introduction" /> For the beginniner three years of its existence it was a currency which was used only in accountance. Euro banknotes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002, and on that day it replaced the former cash of the eurozone 12, as it was then, national currencies like the [[Irish Pound]] and the [[Austrian schilling]].<ref name="Introduction" />

=== After the introduction ===
The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state.<ref name="Introduction">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/intro/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Introduction|publisher=ECB|work=ECB}}</ref> The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from ten years to forever.<ref name="Introduction" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancaditalia.it/bancomonete/cambiolire;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en |title=Bank of Italy - Exchange of lira notes and coins|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011|work=Banc d'Italia|publisher=Banc d'Italia}}</ref>

=== Changes ===
There has so far only been one series of euro notes, however a new series similar to the current one is to be issued from 2011.<ref name="Banknotes index" /> The initial issue of notes bears the signature of the first [[President of the European Central Bank|president]] of the [[European Central Bank]], [[Wim Duisenberg]], who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], whose signature appears on subsequent issues.<ref name="Banknotes index" />

== Environmental impact ==
As an environment-friendly institution, the European Central Bank tries very hard to make a shrewd use of natural resources, to keep the quality of the world and to save people's health in the produce and supplying of euro notes.<ref name="Enviro impact">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/html/environment.en.html|title=ECB: Environmental impact of euro banknotes|publisher=ecb.int|work=ECB|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>
