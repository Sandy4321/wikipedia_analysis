'''Cod''' is the common name for [[genus]] ''Gadus'', belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Gadidae]], and is also used in the common name for various other fishes. Cod is a popular [[food]] with a mild flavor, low fat content and a dense, flaky [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white flesh]]. Cod livers are processed to make [[cod liver oil]], an important source of [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin D]], [[vitamin E]] and [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s ([[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]). Larger cod caught during [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] are sometimes called '''skrei'''. Young Atlantic cod or [[haddock]] prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod.

The Atlantic cod, which can change color at certain water depths, has two distinct color phases: grey-green and reddish brown. Its average mass is {{convert|5|-|12|kg|lb}}, but specimens weighing up to {{convert|100|kg|lb}} have been recorded. Cod feed on [[mollusk|molluscs]], [[crab]]s, [[sea star|starfish]], [[worm]]s, [[squid]], and small fish. Some migrate to warm water in winter to spawn. A large female lays up to five million eggs in midocean, a very small number of which survive. Pacific or saltwater cod are also found around the coast of British Columbia, Canada and the Northwestern US coastal areas. These fish are three times the size of their eastern counterparts{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and are darker in colour.

[[Pollock]], and [[coalfish]] are often found on the same grounds as codfish in cool Atlantic waters. Pollock have shovel-shaped tails and pale lateral lines and grow to {{convert|1|m|ft}} and {{convert|15|kg |lb}}. Some grow to {{convert|2|m|ft}} in length. 

Cod meat is moist and flaky when cooked and is white in color. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Atlantic cod]] is one of the most common ingredients in [[fish and chips]], along with [[haddock]] and [[plaice]]. It is also frequently consumed in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. 

Cod are currently at risk from overfishing in the UK, Canada and most other Atlantic countries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://environment.independent.co.uk/green_living/article3166434.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Pollack sales rise, as public gets message on cod | first1=Martin | last1=Hickman | first2=Consumer | last2=Affairs | date=2007-11-16 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
At various times in the past, taxonomists incorrectly included many [[species]] in Gadus. The great majority of these are now either classified in other genera, or have been recognized as simply forms of one of three species. Modern taxonomy, therefore, recognizes only three species in this genus:
*''Gadus macrocephalus'' - [[Pacific cod]]
*''Gadus morhua'' - [[Atlantic cod]]
*''Gadus ogac'' - [[Greenland cod]]

All these species have a profusion of [[common name]]s, most of them including the word "cod". Many common names have been used of more than one species, in different places or at different times.

=="Cod" that is not cod==
===Related species===
''Cod'' forms part of the [[common name]] of many other fish no longer classified in the genus ''Gadus''. Many are members of the family [[Gadidae]]; others are members of three related families within the order [[Gadiformes]] whose names include the word "cod": the  [[morid cod]]s, [[Moridae]] (100 or so species); the eel cods, [[Muraenolepididae]] (4 species); and the [[Eucla cod]], [[Euclichthyidae]] (1 species). The tadpole cod family ([[Ranicipitidae]]) has now been placed in Gadidae.

[[Image:Codstamp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cod postage stamp, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]|alt=Drawing of paper with serrated edge, value of 1 cent, portraying piled-up fish]]

[[Gadiformes]] include:
*[[Arctic cod]]  ''Arctogadus glacialis''
*[[East Siberian cod]] ''Arctogadus borisovi''
*[[Eucla cod]] ''Euclichthys polynemus''
*[[Pelagic cod]] ''Melanonus gracilis''
*[[Polar cod]] ''Boreogadus saida''
*[[Poor cod]]  ''Trisopterus minutus''
*[[Rock cod]] ''Lotella rhacina''
*[[Saffron cod]]  ''Eleginus gracilis''
*[[Small-headed cod]] ''Lepidion microcephalus''
*[[Tadpole cod]] ''Guttigadus globosus''
Some fish have common names derived from "cod", such as [[codling]], [[codlet]] or [[tomcod]]. ("Codling" is also used as a name for a young cod.)

===Unrelated species===
Some fish commonly known as cod are unrelated to ''Gadus''. Part of this name confusion is market-driven. Severely shrunken Atlantic cod stocks have led to the marketing of cod replacements using [[culinary name|names]] of the form "''x'' cod", according to culinary rather than phyletic similarity. The common names for the following species have become well-established; note that all inhabit the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

====Perciformes====
Fish of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Perciformes]] that are commonly called "cod" include:
*[[Blue cod]] ''Parapercis colias''
*[[Eastern freshwater cod]] ''Maccullochella ikei''
*[[Mary River cod]] ''Maccullochella peelii mariensis''
*[[Murray cod]] ''Maccullochella peelii peelii''
*[[Sleepy cod]] ''Oxyeleotris lineolatus''
*[[Trout cod]] ''Maccullochella macquariensis''
*The cod icefish family, [[Nototheniidae]], including:
**[[Antarctic cod]] ''Dissostichus mawsoni''
**[[Black cod]] ''Paranotothenia microlepidota''
**[[Maori cod]] ''Paranotothenia magellanica''

====Rock cod, reef cod, and coral cod====
Almost all [[coral cod]], [[reef cod]] or [[rock cod]] are also in order [[Perciformes]]. Most are better known as [[grouper]]s, and belong to the family [[Serranidae]]. Others belong to the [[Nototheniidiae]]. Two exceptions are the [[Australasia]]n [[red rock cod]], which belongs to a different order (see below), and the fish known simply as the rock cod and as [[soft cod]] in New Zealand, ''[[Lotella rhacina]]'', which as noted above actually is related to the true cod (it is a morid cod).

====Scorpaeniformes====
From the order [[Scorpaeniformes]]:
*[[Ling cod]] ''Ophiodon elongatus''
*[[Red rock cod]] ''Scorpaena papillosa''

====Ophidiiformes====
The tadpole cod family, [[Ranicipitidae]], and the [[Eucla cod]] family, [[Euclichthyidae]], were formerly classified in the order [[Ophidiiformes]], but are now grouped with the [[Gadiformes]].

===Marketed as===
Some fish that do not have "cod" in their names are sometimes sold as cod. Haddock and whiting belong in the same family, the Gadidae, as cod.
* [[Haddock]] ''Melanogrammus aeglefinus''
* [[Merlangius merlangus|Whiting]] ''Merlangius merlangus''

==Identification==
Cod have three rounded [[Dorsal fin|dorsal]] and two [[anal fin]]s. The [[pelvic fin]]s are small with the first ray extended, and are set under the [[gill]] cover (i.e. the throat region), in front of the [[pectoral fin]]s. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well developed [[beard|chin barbel]]. The eyes are medium sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin barbel. Cod have a distinct white [[lateral line]] running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, to the base of the [[caudal fin|caudal]] or tail fin. The back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown, and showing extensive mottling especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon especially for individuals who have resided in rocky inshore regions.

==Breeding==
Cod divide into several stocks, including the [[Norway|Arcto-Norwegian]], [[North Sea]], [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]], [[Iceland]], [[East Greenland]], [[West Greenland]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and [[Labrador]] stocks. There seems to be little interchange between the stocks, although migrations to their individual breeding grounds may involve distances of {{convert|200|mi|km}}or more.

Spawning occurs between January to April (March and April are the peak months), at a depth of {{convert|200|m|ft}} in specific spawning grounds at water temperatures of between {{convert|4|and|6|C|F}}. Around the UK, the major spawning grounds are in the Middle to Southern North Sea, the start of the [[Bristol Channel]] (north of [[Newquay]]), the [[Irish Channel]] (both east and west of the [[Isle of Man]]), around [[Stornoway]], and east of [[Helmsdale]].

Pre-spawning courtship involves fin displays, and male grunting{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, which leads to pairing. The male inverts himself beneath the female, and the pair swim in circles while spawning. The eggs are planktonic and hatch between 8 to 23 days with larva reaching {{convert|4|mm|in}} in length. This planktonic phase lasts some ten weeks, enabling the young cod to increase its body weight by 40-fold, and growing to about {{convert|2|cm|in}}. The young cod then move to the seabed and change their diet to small [[benthic]] [[crustaceans]], such as [[isopods]] and small crabs. They increase in size to {{convert|8|cm|in}}in the first six months, {{convert|14|-|18|cm|in}} by the end of their first year, and to {{convert|25|-|35|cm|in}} by the end of the second. Growth tends to be less at higher latitudes. Cod reach maturity at about {{convert|50|cm|in}} at about 3 to 4 years of age.

==Biome==
Cod occupy varied habitat, favouring rough ground, especially inshore. [[Demersal]] in depths of between {{convert|20|-|200|ft}},{{convert|80|m|ft}} on average, although not uncommon to depths of {{convert|600|m|ft}}. Off the Norwegian and New England coasts and on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], cod congregate at certain seasons in water of {{convert|30|-|70|m|ft}} depth. Cod are gregarious and form schools, although [[shoaling]] tends to be a feature of the spawning season.

==Predation==
Adult cod are active hunters, feeding on [[sand eel]]s, [[whiting]], [[haddock]], small cod, [[squid]], [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[worm]]s, [[mackerel]], and [[mollusc]]s. Young cod avoid larger prey.

==Parasites==
Cod and related species are plagued by parasites. One of the most interesting is a grotesque and massively modified crustacean, known as the [[cod worm]] (''Lernaeocera branchialis''). This animal starts life as a small free swimming [[larva]] that is undoubtedly a crustacean. Its first host is the [[lumpsucker]] which it captures with grasping hooks at the front of its body. It penetrates the lumpsucker with a thin [[filament]] that it uses to suck blood. Cod worms mate on the lumpsucker and the female takes her fertilized eggs to a cod and clinging to its gills, metamorphoses into something that looks scarcely animal. Her crustacean features give way to a plump, s-shaped, worm-like body. Nestled against the rear of her body is a coiled mass of egg strings. The worm is also grotesque in behaviour because the front part of her body penetrates the body of the fish and enters the rear bulb of the host's [[heart]]. Firmly rooted in the cod's circulatory system, the front part of the female parasite grows like the branches of a tree, reaching down into the main [[artery]]. The worm extracts nutrients from the cod's blood and remains there, safely tucked beneath the cod's gill cover, eventually releasing her offspring into the water.<ref>

==Cod trade/history==

{{seealso|Cod fisheries}}
{{Commonscat|Cod dishes}}
Cod has been an important economic commodity in [[international market]]s since the [[Viking]] period (around 800 AD). [[Norway|Norwegians]] traveled with [[dried and salted cod|dried cod]] and soon a dried cod market developed in southern [[Europe]]. This market has lasted for more than 1000 years, enduring the [[Black Death]], wars and other crises and is still an important Norwegian fish trade.<ref>

The fish was so important to the history and development of [[Massachusetts]], the that state's senate hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the [[Sacred Cod of Massachusetts]], in its chambers.

Apart from the long history cod differ from most fish because the fishing grounds are far from population centers. The large cod fisheries along the coast of [[North Norway]] (and in particular close to the [[Lofoten]] islands) have been developed almost uniquely for [[export]], depending on sea transport of [[stockfish]] over large distances.<ref>

[[William Pitt the Elder]], criticizing the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], claimed that cod was "British gold"; and that it was folly to restore [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fishing rights to the [[France|French]].

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the New World, especially in [[Massachusetts]] and Newfoundland, cod became a major commodity, creating trade networks and cross-cultural exchanges. In 1733, Britain tried to gain control over trade between New England and the British [[Caribbean]] by imposing the [[Molasses Act]], which they believed would eliminate the trade by making it unprofitable. The cod trade grew instead because the <U+201C>French were eager to work with the New Englanders in a lucrative contraband arrangement<U+201D>.<ref name=kurl/> The American settlers traded cod with the French Caribbean for rum-producing molasses. In addition to increasing trade, the New England settlers organized into a <U+201C>codfish aristocracy<U+201D>. The colonists rose up against Britain's <U+201C>tariff on an import<U+201D>. Angry merchants, including John Hancock and John Rowe, disguised themselves, boarded their own ships and dumped their own goods into the harbor, an event known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] (p.&nbsp;96).<ref name=kurl/> 

In the 20th century, [[Iceland]] re-emerged as a fishing power and entered the [[Cod Wars]]. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, fishing off the European and American coasts severely depleted stocks and become a major political issue. The necessity of restricting catches to allow stocks to recover upset the fishing industry and politicians reluctant to hurt employment. The 2006 Northwest [[Atlantic cod]] [[IFQ|quota]] is 23,000 tons representing half the available stocks, while the Northeast Atlantic quota is 473,000 tons.

Pacific Cod is currently enjoying strong global demand. The 2006 [[Total Allowable Catch]] (TAC) for the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and [[Aleutian Islands]] was 260,000 tons.

==Endangered-species controversies in Canada and Europe==
Following the early 1990s collapse of Canadian stocks, the Canadian [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] (DFO) banned Northern cod fishing in 1992, which caused great economic hardship in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. In 1995, in a controversial move, [[Brian Tobin]] the Canadian Federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, reopened the hunt on the [[harp seal]], which prey on cod, stating: "There is only one major player still fishing the cod. His name is harp and his second name is seal."<ref>[http://www.seashepherd.org/ocean_realm/ocean_realm_aut99.html Sea Shepherd - Ocean Realm Autumn 1999<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

The DFO partly lifted its ban in 1997, although the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] noted the poor recovery of Canadian stocks.<ref>[http://www.ices.dk/marineworld/recoveryplans.asp Marine World - Will Atlantic cod ever recover<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In general, depleted populations of cod and other gadids appear to recover poorly when fishing pressure is reduced or stopped.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6798/abs/406882a0.html Collapse and recovery of marine fishes: Abstract: Nature<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In 1998, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] (COSEWIC) listed the Atlantic cod as a species of "special concern", though not as an [[endangered species]]. [[Dr. Kim Bell]], who drafted the report for COSEWIC, subsequently stated that the original report in fact ''had'' advised endangered status but that pressure by the DFO had suppressed this.<ref>[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/specialfeatures/atlanticcod/cod.asp Atlantic Cod Endangered: Canadian Geographic Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In 2000, WWF placed cod on the [[endangered species]] list. The WWF issued a report stating that global cod catch had suffered a 70 percent drop over the last 30 years, and that if this trend continued, the world<U+2019>s cod stocks would disappear in 15 years.<ref>[http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/media/press/2004/WWFPresitem711.html WWF - No more cod in 15 years, WWF report warns<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  <U+00C5>smund Bjordal, director of the [[Norwegian Institute of Marine Research]] disputed the WWF's claim, noting the healthy [[Barents Sea]] cod population.<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article319556.ece Cod not endangered species - Aftenposten.no<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Cod is among Norway's most important fishery exports and the [[Barents Sea]] is Norway's most important cod fishery. 

In 2003, COSEWIC placed the [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] fisheries on the endangered species list and Fisheries Minister [[Robert Thibault]] announced an indefinite closure in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and off Newfoundland's northeast coast. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed that the [[Barents Sea]] cod fishery appeared to be healthy but that the situation may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high quotas.<ref>[http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/norway/news/?12982/The-Barents-Sea-Cod-the-last-of-the-large-cod-stocks WWF - The Barents Sea Cod - the last of the large cod stocks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2005 the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]&mdash;Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on the [[Grand Banks]], in the form of [[bycatch]]. WWF also claimed poor enforcement by [[NAFO]], an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific fishery advice and management in the northwestern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].<ref>[http://www.wwf.ca/NewsAndFacts/NewsRoom/default.asp?section=archive&page=display&ID=1407&lang=EN WWF Canada - News - Fisheries laying waste to endangered fish stocks: WWF-Canada Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.panda.org/wwf_news/?uNewsID=23370 WWF - Cod overfished in the North-West Atlantic despite ban<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

According to [[Seafood Watch]], cod is currently on the list of fish that consumers should avoid. In a  [[The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat|book]] on the subject, [[Charles Clover]] claims that cod is only an example of how unsustainable fishing is destroying ocean ecosystems.<ref>{{cite book

In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the Atlantic cod to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]</ref>

==King cod==
Periodically a cod with a deformed skull is found; the skull has a distinct top or crown giving it the name "king cod" or kongetorsk in Norwegian. In Norway this rare fish was earlier considered to be able to forecast the weather and was commonly used for that purpose. A woolen thread suspended the fish from the ceiling; its nose would point in a different direction depending on the coming weather. In reality, the thread rather than the fish caused the movement. The twisted thread served as a primitive [[hygrometer]] by reacting to the air's humidity, turning the fish as the humidity rose and fell.

==Liver==

Cod's soft liver can be tinned (canned) and eaten.
