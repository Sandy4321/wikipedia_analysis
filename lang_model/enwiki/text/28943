The wildlife in the small landlocked country of  [[Burundi]] is composed of its [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. Burundi is home to 2,950 species species of plants, 596 birds, 163 species of  vertebrates, 52 species of reptiles, 56 species of Amphibians and 215 fish species.<ref name=UNEP/>

The wildlife in Burundi has drastically reduced over the years mainly on account of intense population pressure, conversion of large areas of forest into agricultural land to grow crops and extensive livestock farming.{{Sfn|East|1999|p=74}} However, diverse wildlife fauna reported are elephants, hippopotamus, crocodiles,  wild boars, leopards, antelope, flying lemurs, Guinea hens,  partridges, ducks, geese, quails, and snipe. {{Sfn|AppiahJr|2010|p=221}}

The protected area now in a little more than 5% area of the country.

==Legal status==
There were no national laws on conservation of wildlife during the colonial rule of [[Belgium]] nor any national parks established, except for the only forest reserve which was established in 1933. After 1980, only some action was initiated to establish laws to protect wild life. The first act to be issued was the Decree no. 1/6 dated 3 March 1980 under which national parks (''parc nationaux'') and reserves were proposed to be established to preserve and conserve wildlife of flora and fauna. Under this decree the forest boundaries were to be defined. The Forest Code of 25 March 1985 is an enabling law under which protected forests areas are decreed, restoration and reserve areas are specified. A national Institute for Conservation has been set up as the National Institute for the Conservation of Nature (INCN) under the decree of March 1980. It is now renamed as the National Institute for Environment and Conservation of Nature, which has the responsibility to establish national parks and reserves. It also undertakes scientific research in flora and fauna and also promotes ecotourism.{{Sfn|Centre|1991|p=42}}

==Habitat==
[[File:RusiziRiver.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rusizi River]].]]
Wildlife habitat of Burundi, spread over its 15 provinces, consists of hilly plateaus.{{Sfn|AppiahJr|2010|p=221}} Its biodiversity is broadly categorized under the terrestrial ecosystems and the aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.<ref name=UNEP/> The elevation in the plateau varies between {{Convert|1400|m}} and {{Convert|1800|m}} with the decreasing trend recorded towards the east and southeast of the country. The western area of the country is narrow and borders with the [[Tanganika Lake]] (formed by the trough of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Rift Valley]] and the [[Rusizi River]] (forms border with [[DR Congo]]). The other rivers flowing through the terrain are the [[Malagarisi River]] and the [[Ruvuvu River]].Ruviyaronza, an upper branch of the Kagera River, is the head stream of the Nile which rises in Burundi.{{Sfn|AppiahJr|2010|p=221}}{{Sfn|AppiahJr|2010|p=244}} The rivers system of the country fall under the two main hydrographical basins of the [[Nile basin]] and the [[Congo basin]].<ref name=UNEP>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/biosafety/files/BINBFrepEN.pdf|format=pdf|title=National Biosafety Framework in Burundi|author=UNEP|date=November 2006|accessdate=13 July 2013|publisher=National Institute for Environment and Nature Conservation for UNEP Organization}}</ref> The dominant vegetation that encompasses most of the habitats is of [[savanna]]. Mixed with acacia, eucalyptus and oil palm trees are some of the common vegetation types {{Sfn|AppiahJr|2010|p=221}} 

The western region of the country is formed of hilly terrain of the [[Congo-Nile Divide]] with many hills lying above {{Convert|2500|m}} elevation; the highest mountains are the [[Mount Teza]] ({{Convert|2665|m}}) and [[Mount Heha]] ({{Convert|2670|m}}). The central plateau (about {{Convert|2100|m}} in elevation) forms the middle part of the country. In the southeast, the Malagarasi River flows through [[Kumoso]] depression and borders [[Tanzania]]. The northern part of the country is formed of lowland in [[Commune of Bweru|Bweru]] [[Bugesera]] region and has two lakes (Lakes [[Lake Cohoha|Cohoha]] and [[Lake Rweru|Rweru]]); this region is distinct for its [[Papyrus]] ''Cyperus papyrus'' vegetation.{{Sfn|KanyamibwaWeghe||p=127}} While the forest area is limited to {{Convert|127662|ha}}, and the wetlands account for {{Convert|120000|ha}} (about 5% area of the country). The montane forest which occupied nearly 33 to 50% area of the country in the past is mostly denuded and only a patch of {{Convert|800|ha}} of closed forest is recorded on the banks of Lake Tanganika (the second-deepest lake in the world only 8% of its water spread is in Burundi).{{Sfn|KanyamibwaWeghe||p=128}}

==Climate==
Moderate tropical climate is dominated by the altitudinal difference and an average annual temperature of {{Convert|20|C|F}} is recorded in the plateau region while the Great Rift valley records a temperature of {{Convert|23|C|F}}. Dry season lasts from June to August and again from December to January.{{Sfn|AppiahJr|2010|p=221}} The rainy season is from October to December with annual rainfall varying from {{Convert|500|-|2000|mm}}; Bujumbura, the capital city, has an average rainfall of {{Convert|960|mm}}. The western mountain region receives an average rainfall of {{Convert|1375|mm}}; the eastern plateaus however receives an annual rainfall in the range of {{Convert|1100|-|1250|mm}}.{{Sfn|KanyamibwaWeghe||p=128}}

As of 1982, there were only two national parks and many reserves in the country <U+2013> The [[Ruvubu National Park]] in the Ruvubu River Valley, known for its savannah wildlife and the [[Kibira National Park]] .{{Sfn|East|1999|p=74}}
The ethnic violence in Burundi during the 1990s, whose operations centered in the two national parks left them in a poor state of preservation. The Rusizi Nature Reserve in the flood plains of [[Rusizi River]] in the outer limits of [[Bujumbura]] (capital of Burundi), had also suffered a similar fate till it was declared a National Park in 1990.{{Sfn|East|1999|p=74}}

The brief details of the protected areas in Burundi are the following.

[[Kibira National Park |Park National de la Kibira]] ({{Convert|40000|ha}}) is the largest rainforest which has border with Rwanda<U+2019>s Parc National de Nyungwe where [[Colobus Monkey]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are found.{{Sfn|PlanetHam2010|p=640}}<ref name=Word/>

[[Ruvubu National Park|Park National de la Ruvubu]] ({{Convert|50800|ha}}), the largest park in the country was known for its hikes also. It has expansive views.{{Sfn|PlanetHam2010|p=640}}<ref name=Word/>

[[Rusizi National Park|Parc National de la Rusizi]] ({{Convert|9000|ha}}), {{Convert|15|km}} from Bujumbura is wetland where the wild life species are [[hippos]], [[sitatunga]] (aquatic antelopes) and many species of birds.{{Sfn|PlanetHam2010|p=640}}<ref name=Word/>

Apart from the above mentioned national parks and reserve there the four other reserves are [[Lac Rwihinda Nature Reserve]] ({{Convert|8000|ha}}), [[Bururi Forest Nature Reserve]] ({{Convert|3300|ha}}) (which has last vestiges of [[montane forest]] in the country{{Sfn|East|1999|p=74}}), [[Rumonge Nature Reserve]] ({{Convert|5000|ha}}), and [[Kigwena Forest Nature Reserve]] ({{Convert|800|ha}}). In addition, there are two natural monuments - [[Chutes de la Kagera]] and [[Nyakazu Gorge]].<ref name=Word>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks-worldwide.info/burundi.htm|title=World Institute for Nature and Environment|accessdate=13 July 2013|publisher= Nationalparks-Worldwide.info}}</ref>

==Flora==

The vegetation in the widely varying topography (varying altitude from {{Convert|1000|m}} to {{Convert|2670|m}}), differing soil conditions and temperate climatic conditions prevailing in the country has caused a multi vegetational type of flora. The East African evergreen bushland and secondary grassland with Acacia trees are the vegetation types in the eastern and south-eastern part while the [[Afromontane]] vegetation including transitional type of rainforests dominates the western mountain region. [[Hyphaene]]<U+2013>[[Acacia]] and Brachystegia trees are noted in the lake shores. The [[Brachystegia]]<U+2013>[[Julbernardia]] ([[miombo]]) trees are the vegetation types seen in country's south-eastern border. The [[Bugesera region]] in the north and the [[Kumoso depression]] on the east have profuse vegetation of Acacia<U+2013>[[Combretum]] trees, and Brachystegia trees.{{Sfn|KanyamibwaWeghe||pp=127-128}}
The vascular flora reported is of 2950 species under 195 families. In the high altitude in particular many species of wild flora are reported to be endemic; 70 species of plants are reported in this category.<ref name=UNEP/>

==Fauna==
[[file:Rusizi NP hippopotamus.jpg|thumbnail|Hippopotamus at Rusizi.]]
The faunal species reported are 163 species of  vertebrates, 52 species of reptiles, 56 species of Amphibians and 215 fish species. It is also reported that at high altitudes endemicity is distinct in  17 species of mammals and 22 species of birds. The Lake Tanganyika has  200 species fish and equal number of molluscs.<ref name=UNEP/> 

A scientific exploration team of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] found the [[Bururi long-fingered frog]] (''Cardioglossa cyaneospila)'' , which till recently was considered extinct.

{{main|List of birds of Burundi}}
The avi fauna reported are 596 species (439 resident and 109 seasonal migrants) of which 13 species of global conservation concern and three are introduced species; more species have been found but their deatils are not recorded (thus UNEP reports 716 species<ref name=UNEP/>). There are no endemic bird species.{{Sfn|KanyamibwaWeghe||p=128}}

There are five [[Important Bird Areas]] (IBAs) declared by the [Bird Life International]], in the country which cover an area of {{Convert|1018|km2}} and which accounts to 3.7% area of the country. These coalesce with the  National Parks and two Forest or Nature Reserves.{{Sfn|KanyamibwaWeghe||p=128}}

==Environmental==
Uncontrolled cutting of trees for fuel-wood, coupled with agricultural clearing and grazing lands has resulted in nearly complete [[deforestation]] of the country. This serious loss of land has effected wildlife severely.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85931/Burundi/40655/Plant-and-animal-life|title=Plant and animal life|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref> Widespread ethnic civil war and the subsequent collapse of government conservation efforts further reduced forest areas and resulted in increased [[poaching]] of wildlife.<ref name="Britannica"/> Before the savage civil war, high population density (450 people per square kilometer) on mountain slopes resulted in heavy soil loss and damage to agriculture. Due to habitat destruction, [[gorilla]]s and [[elephant]]s are extinct in Burundi and virtually all wildlife is threatened. 

Officially just 5.4 percent of Burundi's land mass is under any form of protection. In 2005, the government of [[Burundi]] announced a ban on the harvesting of natural [[Christmas tree]]s in an effort to slow deforestation. Since the Christmas trees are an introduced plantation species, the ban had little effect on the country's biodiversity.
