"''''Round Springfield'''" is the 22nd episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on April 30, 1995.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons episode guides|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=173}}</ref> In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is rushed to hospital after eating a jagged metal Krusty-O and decides to sue [[Krusty the Clown]]. Whilst visiting Bart, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] meets her old mentor, jazz musician [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#"Bleeding Gums" Murphy|Bleeding Gums Murphy]]. She is saddened when she later learns that Murphy has died, and resolves to honor his memory. [[Steve Allen]] (as himself) and [[Ron Taylor (actor)|Ron Taylor]] (as Bleeding Gums Murphy) guest star, each in their second appearance on the show. 

It was written by [[Joshua Sternin]] and [[Jeffrey Ventimilia]] based on a story idea by [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] and was the first episode directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]]. Jean and Reiss, who were previously the series' showrunners, returned to produce this episode (as well as "[[A Star Is Burns]]") in order to lessen the workload of the show's regular staff. They worked on it alongside the staff of ''[[The Critic]]'', the series they had left ''The Simpsons'' to create. The episode marks the first time in which a recurring character was killed off in the show, something the staff had considered for a while. The episode features numerous cultural references, including [[Carole King]]'s song "[[Jazzman]]", the actor [[James Earl Jones]] and the ''[[Kimba the White Lion#The Lion King controversy|Kimba the White Lion/The Lion King]]'' controversy. 

The episode also features the phrase "[[cheese-eating surrender monkeys]]", used by [[Groundskeeper Willie]] to describe the [[French people|French]], which has since entered the public lexicon. It has been used and referenced frequently by journalists and academics and has been included in two [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] quotation dictionaries.

== Plot ==
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] gets a stomachache after accidentally eating a jagged metal Krusty-O with his breakfast cereal. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is the only one who believes him, however, and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] send him to school anyway. Bart struggles through the test, and after finally convincing [[Edna Krabappel|Mrs. Krabappel]] that he is actually ill, she lets him go and see the nurse. Bart collapses on the medical room floor, and is taken to Springfield General Hospital where he undergoes surgery from [[Dr. Hibbert]] and [[Dr. Nick (The Simpsons)|Dr. Nick]], as it emerges he has [[appendicitis]]. While visiting Bart in the hospital, Lisa meets her hero, jazzman [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#"Bleeding Gums" Murphy|Bleeding Gums Murphy]], in a bed in another ward.

Later, Bleeding Gums lends Lisa his saxophone for her school recital. It starts off terribly (owing to most of the orchestra having their appendixes removed so they could miss school), but Lisa gets up and performs a solo routine, becoming the star of the show. Returning to the hospital the next day, Lisa is saddened to learn that Bleeding Gums has died. Lisa is the only person who attends Bleeding Gums's funeral, and she vows to make sure that everyone in Springfield knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy. Bart, meanwhile, sues [[Krusty the Clown]] and is given a $100,000 [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. However, after Bart's attorney [[Lionel Hutz]] takes his "legal fees", Bart is left with only $500, though Bart seems to be okay with it.

Still stricken with grief, Lisa decides that the best way to honor Bleeding Gums' memory is by having his album played at the local jazz station. Lisa spots it in the Android's Dungeon store for $250, but after hearing that Bleeding Gums is dead, [[Comic Book Guy]] doubles the price to $500. Bart then walks in with his $500 and, after remembering that Lisa was the only one who believed him about his stomach ache, Bart decides to buy the album with his money, and Lisa thanks him for it. When the station plays one of Bleeding Gums's songs, Lisa is disappointed because the station's tiny range still prevents anyone from hearing it. Lightning then strikes the antenna, giving it extra power and projecting it into every radio in Springfield. Lisa is finally satisfied. After proclaiming "that was for you Bleeding Gums," she turns to leave, but not before Bleeding Gums appears from the heavens to tell Lisa that she had made "an old jazz man happy". After saying a final goodbye, Lisa and Bleeding Gums jam to "[[Jazzman]]" one last time.

== Production ==
"'Round Springfield" was written by [[Joshua Sternin]] and [[Jeffrey Ventimilia]], based on a story idea by [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]].<ref name="book"/><ref name=Reiss/> It was the first episode directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]].<ref name=Moore>{{cite video | people=Moore, Steven Dean|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "'Round Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Due to Fox's demand for 24 or 25 episodes per season, which the production staff found impossible to meet, two episodes of each season were written and produced by former [[showrunner]]s, to relieve the stress on ''The Simpsons''{{'}} writing staff.<ref name=nohomers2>{{cite web |url=http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=53574 |title=Ask Bill and Josh 2 Q&A Thread |accessdate=2010-07-26|publisher=[[NoHomers.net]] |date=2006-01-08 }}</ref> Jean and Reiss, who were showrunners for the show's [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third]] and [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth seasons]] returned to produce this episode, as well as "[[A Star Is Burns]]", instead of the season's main showrunner [[David Mirkin]]. On both episodes, they were aided by the staff of ''[[The Critic]]'', the show the two left ''The Simpsons'' to create.<ref name=Reiss/><ref name=nohomers2/> Sternin and Ventimilia were writers on ''The Critic'' and were big fans of ''The Simpsons'', so were thrilled to be able to write an episode.<ref>{{cite video | people=Sternin, Joshua|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "'Round Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | people=Ventimilia, Jeffrey|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "'Round Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

This episode marked the first time a recurring character has been killed off on the show. The writers and production team felt that it would be a good, emotional storyline, which, through Lisa, could focus on the theme of grief.<ref name=Jean>{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "'Round Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They decided that it could not be one of the main characters; Jean joked that "we wouldn't want it to be someone like [[Mr. Burns]], that we'd obviously want to see in the show again".<ref name=Jean/> Eventually Jean decided on [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#"Bleeding Gums" Murphy|Bleeding Gums Murphy]], a character introduced in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]] episode "[[Moaning Lisa]]"; a flashback to "Moaning Lisa" is featured in the episode.<ref name="bbc"/> Murphy was a fairly minor character, only appearing in a couple of episodes, but he appeared in the show's opening sequence and remained there after this episode,<ref name=Reiss/> until the opening was re-designed in [[The Simpsons (season 20)|season 20]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02222009/entertainment/movies/q_a__matt_groening_156410.htm |title=Q&A: Matt Groening - New York Post |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2009-03-22 | first=Larry | last=Getlen}}</ref> Moore's first ever job on the show was in the animation department for "Moaning Lisa" so he "appreciated" being able to direct this episode.<ref name=Moore/> Reiss stated "I had been polling for years to kill [[Simpson family#Jacqueline Bouvier|Marge's mom]] but this was a better idea".<ref name=Reiss>{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "'Round Springfield"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Actor [[Ron Taylor (actor)|Ron Taylor]] returned to guest star as Murphy in the episode.<ref name=Reiss/> Comedian [[Steve Allen]] also made his second guest appearance on the show, having previously appeared in the episode "[[Separate Vocations]]".<ref name=Jean/>

The main story of the episode's first act sees Bart get appendicitis from eating a jagged metal Krusty-O. Mike Reiss's father, being a doctor, "sort of" acted as the medical consultant on this episode. He stated that "you can't get" appendicitis from eating a piece of metal, but the writers decided to do it anyway.<ref name=Reiss/> In his flashback, Murphy is shown as having a "$1,500 a day [[Faberg<U+00E9> egg]] habit"; Jean "didn't realize just how expensive" Faberg<U+00E9> eggs actually were, so the joke does not make much sense.<ref name=Jean/>

In the episode, budget cuts at [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary School]] force the janitor [[Groundskeeper Willie]] to be used as a [[French language|French]] teacher. Expressing his disdain for the [[French people|French]], he exclaims to his class: "Bonjour, you cheese-eatin' surrender monkeys."<ref name="book"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Simpsons In The Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield|page=12|author=Du Vernay, Denise; Waltonen, Karma|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|isbn=0-7864-4490-8}}</ref> The quote, particularly the phrase "cheese-eating surrender monkeys", has since entered wider use. It was used particularly in the run-up to the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], having been popularized by the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' journalist [[Jonah Goldberg]], to describe European and especially French opposition to military action.
