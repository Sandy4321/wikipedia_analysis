{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}'''Parsbit''', also known as '''Prisbit''', was a [[Khazar]] noblewoman active in the 730s CE. In [[Muslim]] sources, Parsbit is called "the mother of the [[khagan]]."

Whether she was the regent for an infant [[monarch]] (unlikely, since during the same period [[Barjik]] is called "the son of the khagan"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}) or for an incompetent one (again unlikely, since the Khazars during this period practiced [[Human sacrifice|ritual]] [[regicide]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} once a monarch's ability to rule was compromised), or whether she ruled in her own right is unclear. What is certain is that Parsbit (called '''''Barsbek''''' in some sources) wielded an enormous degree of power, even commanding armies (such as the expeditionary force led against [[Armenia]] by [[Tar'mach]] in 730).
