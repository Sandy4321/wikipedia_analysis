'''''Channel Orange''''' (stylized as ''channel ORANGE'') is the debut [[studio album]] of American singer-songwriter [[Frank Ocean]], released July 10, 2012, on [[Def Jam Recordings]]. After releasing his 2011 debut mixtape ''[[Nostalgia, Ultra]]'', Ocean began writing the album with creative partner [[Malay (producer)|Malay]], who then assisted him with its recording. Eschewing the mixtape's reliance on [[sampling (music)|samples]], Ocean wanted to approach sound and [[song structure]] differently on ''Channel Orange''. He recorded most of the album at East West Studio in Hollywood and worked with other musicians, including [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]], [[Sa-Ra|Om'mas Keith]], [[John Mayer]], and [[Andr<U+00E9> 3000]]. Ocean titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon [[grapheme<U+2013>color synesthesia]] and the color he perceived during the summer he first fell in love.

An [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[neo soul]] album, ''Channel Orange'' has an idiosyncratic musical style, unconventional stylistic elements, film-inspired segue tracks, and influences from [[boogie (genre)|electro-funk]], [[pop-soul]], [[jazz-funk]], and [[psychedelic music]]. Its music is typified by unconventional melodies, spatial arrangements, mid-tempo beats, and instruments such as electronic keyboards, muted percussion, and shifting synthesizers. The album's songs explore themes such as unrequited love, spirituality, desire, and decadence, and Ocean's songwriting incorporates empathic lyrics, surrealistic imagery, references to Southern California, and descriptive narratives with dark characters. Ocean's baritone singing on the album is characterized by subtle vocals, free-form flow, and alternating falsetto and tenor registers.

To prevent the album from [[internet leak|leaking]] onto the Internet, Ocean released ''Channel Orange'' digitally one week earlier than its publically announced date. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 131,000 copies in its first week, and [[record chart|charted]] in several other countries, including Norway, where it reached number one. The album was promoted with three [[single (music)|singles]], including Ocean's highest charting solo single "[[Thinkin Bout You]]". Upon its release, ''Channel Orange'' received rave reviews from music critics, who praised its idiosyncratic style, musical scope, and Ocean's songwriting. Ocean [[concert tour|toured]] in promotion of the album in the United States and abroad during July to September 2012. As of July 29, the album has sold 218,000 copies in the US, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].

== Writing and development ==
[[File:120525 NElderkin IDJFrankOcean 055x.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Ocean mused over past experiences and pure fantasy when writing the album.<ref name="Nicholson"/>]]

Ocean started writing songs for ''Channel Orange'' in February with songwriter and producer [[Malay (producer)|Malay]], his friend and creative partner since their start in the music industry as songwriters.<ref name="Wete">{{cite journal|last=Wete|first=Brad|date=July 6, 2012|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/07/interview-frank-ocean-channel-orange-producer-malay/page/1|title=Interview: Frank Ocean's Co-Writer And Producer Malay Talks About Making "Channel Orange," Andre 3000 and Kanye's Help, And Frank Coming Out|journal=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=Complex Media|accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref><ref name="Calvert"/> They originally met in Atlanta and worked for the same publishing company, through which they reconnected after Malay moved to Los Angeles.<ref name="Wete"/> Ocean started hanging out with Malay, introduced him to his Odd Future collective, and connected creatively through their respective songwriting, which led to their partnership for ''Channel Orange''.<ref name="Wete"/> For the album, Ocean wrote his lyrics to complement Malay's ideas for the music.<ref name="Wete"/> Occasionally, they wrote songs together by improvising musical ideas from Malay's keyboard and guitar playing.<ref name="Wete"/> 

Although he had [[artistic freedom|creative freedom]] for both projects, Ocean felt more confident as a songwriter for ''Channel Orange'' and typed his lyrics on a laptop rather than composing in his mind, which he did for ''Nostalgia, Ultra''.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Elliott|date=July 16, 2012|url=http://respect-mag.com/respect-online-exclusive-success-is-certain-elliott-wilson-interviews-frank-ocean/|title=Success Is Certain|journal=[[RESPECT. (magazine)|RESPECT.]]|publisher=Musinart|location=New York|accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> Since transitioning from writing for other artists, he had been influenced by his "gloriously painful love life" when writing songs.<ref name="Caramanica"/> For his lyrics on the album, Ocean used both his past personal experiences and imagination to compose narratives for songs.<ref name="Nicholson"/> In an interview for ''[[The Guardian]]'', he expressed uncertainty about his penchant for darker subject matter, but speculated that "those were the colours I had to work with on those days. [...] I mean, 'experience' is an interesting word. I just bear witness."<ref name="Nicholson"/> 

During their writing, Malay noticed Ocean's use of [[Gender-specific pronoun|gender pronouns]] in his lyrics, but attributed it to poetic license rather than sexuality.<ref name="Wete"/> In an interview following Ocean's open letter, Malay characterized him as "the new hybrid of what an [[rapping|MC]] used to be in the '80s or '90s [...] the true storyteller" and elaborated on the lyrics, saying that "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening [...] [W]hen he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal<U+2014>like something that he<U+2019>s experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it".<ref name="Wete"/> They finished writing the album in two to three months.<ref name="Wete"/> Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for ''[[Rap-Up]]'', "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness."<ref name="singlecover"/>

== Recording ==
[[File:Pharrell performing September 2008.jpg|right|thumb|210px|[[Pharrell]], one of Ocean's creative influences, co-produced two songs.<ref name="Fennessey"/>]]

Once the songs were written, Ocean ordered them into what ultimately became the album's track listing and began recording them in that order.<ref name="Wete"/> He recorded most of the album at East West Studio in Hollywood Hills, near where he was renting a home.<ref name="Caramanica"/> The studio featured outdated recording equipment.<ref name="Caramanica"/> Other recording locations included [[Henson Recording Studios]] and the [[Record Plant]] in Hollywood, [[Westlake Recording Studios]] and Studio for the Talented & Gifted in Los Angeles, Manhattan Sound Recording in New York City, and San Ysidro in Beverly Hills.<ref name="credits"/> He originally planned to rent recording equipment and the Beverly Hills mansion alone rather than rent a studio for $1,600 a day.<ref name="Lowe"/> He had a maid at the mansion and enjoyed its amenities, including a pool and a sauna, but ended up recording only three songs there: "Lost", "[[Pyramids (song)|Pyramids]]", and "Analog 2", a collaboration with Tyler, The Creator.<ref name="Lowe"/> Ocean recorded his vocals alone for several months, striving intensively for high performance standards, before rejoining Malay for the album's production.<ref name="Wete"/>

In the wake of ''Nostalgia, Ultra'', other artists took interest in Ocean and contacted him about working together, leading to collaborations on ''Channel Orange''.<ref name="Wete"/> He previewed songs at different stages of completion to get feedback from guest artists, some of whom he cited as his "creative heroes",<ref name="Frith"/> including record producer [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]].<ref name="Wete"/> He co-wrote and co-produced the song "[[Sweet Life]]" with Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cheesman|first=Danielle|date=July 9, 2012|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/groove-blogpost.aspx?post=6904b968-a285-42a7-ad34-fdf122d20c6a|title=

=== Post-production ===
The album's post-production lasted into July 2012.<ref name="Wilson"/> Ocean and Malay [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the album at Studio for the Talented & Gifted, as did engineer [[Spike Stent]] at The Mix Suite in Los Angeles.<ref name="credits"/> ''Channel Orange'' was [[audio mastering|mastered]] by Vlado Miller at [[Masterdisk]] in New York City.<ref name="credits"/> Malay called the album his and Ocean's "art project" and said that they focused on sonic "intricacies" such as interludes and skits on tracks when mixing the album.<ref name="Wete"/> According to Malay, Kanye West helped Ocean during the album's final stages by providing "a mentorship situation where it's like, 'This record is amazing. It's incredible. Let me help you out in other ways. Let me connect you with my visual people' and just having that cosign and that support."<ref name="Wete"/> In an interview for ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', Malay reflected on the album's completion and their mindset throughout, saying that "We were somewhat oblivious to how quickly everything happened, because as things were growing from ''Nostalgia'' to all these other things, we were super involved in getting this record done. It was almost like as we are grinding in the studio, his name is continuing to get bigger and bigger."<ref name="Wete"/> 

To downplay himself from being "the focal point" of the album, Ocean did not want his name on the cover and had Everest, his [[Bernese Mountain Dog]], credited as the [[executive producer]].<ref name="Caramanica"/> He titled the album as a reference to [[grapheme<U+2013>color synesthesia]], a neurological phenomenon in which an individual's perception of numbers and letters is associated with the experience of colors.<ref name="Fennessey">{{cite web|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|date=June 29, 2012|url=http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/52311/summer-blues-frank-oceans-channel-orange-listening-party|title=Summer Blues: Frank Ocean's Channel Orange Listening Party|publisher=[[Bill Simmons#Life and career#Grantland.com|Grantland]]. [[ESPN.com|ESPN Internet Ventures]]|accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> Ocean had discussed the phenomenon with Pharrell, who also experienced it and similarly referenced it for the title of his side project [[N.E.R.D]]'s 2008 album ''[[Seeing Sounds]]''.<ref name="Fennessey"/> West also experienced it as a youth and was inspired by it when creating his short film ''[[Cruel Summer (film)|Cruel Summer]]'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Margaret|first=Mary|date=May 24, 2012|url=http://www.parade.com/celebrity/news/2012/05/24-kanye-west-debuts-short-film-cannes-kim-kardashian.html|title=Kanye West Debuts Short Film at Cannes With Kim Kardashian|journal=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=Parade Publications|location=New York|accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> The title also references Ocean's first time falling in love, as it was summer and he perceived everything to be [[orange (colour)|orange]].<ref name="Fennessey"/>

Greg Kot of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' found the album to be "exceedingly modest" and stated, "Ocean quietly demands to be taken on his own idiosyncratic, highly individual terms, and he succeeds."<ref name="Kot"/> Killian Fox of ''[[The Observer]]'' commended Ocean for "stay[ing] true to his creative vision" and dubbed the album "an expansive, slow-burning classic that repays patience and close attention".<ref name="Fox"/> Mike Powell of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised the "affecting specificity" of his lyrics and found his moderate style to be a sign of "exceptional wisdom and repose" rather than "numbness".<ref name="Powell"/> Laurence Green of [[musicOMH]] commented that the album leaves listeners "immensely fulfilled" and praised its music as "a cherry-picking of life's cacophony repainted into the most enchanting of collages."<ref name="Green"/> Evan Rytlewski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called it "the latest in a line of revelatory, late-period neo-soul albums, channeling the skewed jazz of Bilal's ''[[Airtight's Revenge]]'', the impish sprawl of Erykah Badu's ''[[New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)|New Amerykah Part Two]]'', and the dovelike grace of Maxwell's ''[[BLACKsummers'night]]'' into a work that's every bit as exquisitely individualistic as all three."<ref name="Rytlewski"/> [[Slant Magazine]]'s Jesse Cataldo dubbed ''Channel Orange'' a "mosaic work" and found it "so textured, complex, and mature that Ocean's recent coming out feels like a footnote".<ref name="Cataldo"/>

Brice Ezell of [[PopMatters]] called the album "very good", although he still found ''Nostalgia, Ultra'' to be "Ocean's true debut."<ref name="Ezell"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Jody Rosen viewed that Ocean is occasionally "less a songwriter than a purveyor of formless [[groove (music)|grooves]]", but commended him as a "subtle storyteller" and wrote that the songs with more rigid structures "have startling force."<ref name="Rosen"/> Jason Lipshutz of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' also viewed that Ocean's themes "could be a bit tighter" at times, but wrote that his "irrepressible spirit carries [the album], shining light on subjects that are not discussed often enough and spinning new webs of ideas around familiar R&B tropes."<ref name="Lipshutz"/> Priya Elan of ''[[NME]]'' commented that the "inventive and spirited" album is "prone to overindulgence but shows a rare talent coming to terms with his ambition", adding that "his ambition lies on the right side of indulgence."<ref name="Elan"/> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' stated, "While Ocean's artistic ambition is impressive, it's his haunting candour that really casts a spell."<ref name="Qmag">{{cite journal|title=Frank Ocean, 'Channel Orange' (Def Jam)|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group|Bauer Media]]|issue=314|location=London|month=September|year=2012}}</ref> In his consumer guide for [[MSN Music]], [[Robert Christgau]] was ambivalent about the album's "[[demimonde]]" narratives, but found its "musical craft" more "even-keeled" than on ''Nostalgia, Ultra'' and stated, "the verbal content rules."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=July 20, 2012|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=d66eaeae-f1da-49fe-9dd4-b968c1df0b10|title=Frank Ocean/Greenberger Greenberg Cebar|publisher=MSN Music.
