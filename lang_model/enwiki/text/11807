'''''Days of Purgatory''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] album by [[Iced Earth]].  It is a collection of remixes and remakes from previous albums. Most of the songs from the ''[[Enter the Realm]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Iced Earth (album)|Iced Earth]]'', and ''[[Night of the Stormrider]]'' were re-sung by [[Matt Barlow]], and on some of the songs the [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] redone. The 2-[[CD|cd]] version also has remastered versions of several songs from ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]''. The album cover features artwork of the [[Chaos Comics]] character [[Purgatori]].

The reason for the album was to improve the original songs, create [[nostalgia]] for older fans and introduce newer fans to Iced Earth's older work.  The 2-[[CD]] limited edition was originally produced for European audiences but has since been released in the United States. ''Days of Purgatory'' was the last new release from the band featuring longtime guitarist Randall Shawver, and the first to feature bassist [[James MacDonough]] and drummer [[Brent Smedley]].

The song "Written on the Walls" from the band's [[Iced Earth (album)|self titled album]] was given completely new lyrics and renamed "Cast in Stone". The only songs left unrecorded from the band's first albums were "Mystical End", "The Path I Choose", and "Curse the Sky", though the latter two were both performed live with Barlow on vocals. "Winter Nights" was recorded during early sessions for ''[[Night of the Stormrider]]'' while [[Gene Adam]] was still on vocals, but this was the track which prompted Schaffer to ask Adam to get singing lessons, as it was felt he could not handle the high notes. Therefore, the song was not used on the album due to its acrimonious history, though it would have fit in with the storyline of the album. Live performances of this song from that era (such as Wuppertal '91) show him struggling to sing it, probably contributing to his dismissal. Schaffer eventually dug the song out of the vaults to use on this album with Barlow providing vocals.
