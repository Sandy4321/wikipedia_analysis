Zafar was the son of [[Akbar Shah II]] and Lalbai, who was a [[Hindu]] [[Rajput]], and became Mughal Emperor when his father died on September 28, 1837. He was widely known as '''Bahadur Shah Zafar'''.  He used '''Zafar,''' a part of his name, meaning <U+201C>victory<U+201D>,<ref>http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Zafar</ref> as a ''nom de plume'' (''[[takhallus]]'') as an [[Urdu poetry|Urdu poet]] and wrote many Urdu ghazals under it. After his involvement in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the British tried and then exiled him from [[Delhi]].

==Ascent to the Throne / Masnad==
Zafar's father, [[Akbar Shah II]], ruled over a rapidly disintegrating empire between 1806 to 1837. It was during his time that the East India Company dispensed with the illusion of ruling in the name of the Mughal monarch and removed his name from the Persian texts that appeared on the coins struck by the company in the areas under their control.

Zafar was not his father<U+2019>s preferred choice as his successor. One of Akbar Shah's queens, Mumtaz Begum, had been pressuring him to declare her son [[Mirza Jahangir]] as his successor. The East India Company exiled Jahangir after he attacked their resident, [[Archibald Seton]], in the Red Fort.<ref>Husain, MS (2006) Bahadur Shah Zafar; And the War of 1857 in Delhi, Aakar Books, Delhi, P87-88</ref>

==As emperor==
[[File:The Emperor Bahadur Shah II Enthroned.jpg|thumb|left|The Emperor Bahadur Shah II Enthroned]]
Bahadur Shah Zafar presided over a Mughal empire that barely extended beyond [[Delhi]]'s [[Red Fort]]. The East India Company were the dominant political and military power in mid 19th-century India. Outside [[East India Company|Company controlled India]], hundreds of kingdoms and principalities, from the large to the small, fragmented the land. The emperor in Delhi was paid some respect by the Company and allowed a pension, the authority to collect some taxes, and to maintain a small military force in Delhi, but he posed no threat to any power in India. Bahadur Shah II himself did not take an interest in statecraft or possess any imperial ambitions. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the British Administration exiled him from [[Delhi]]. 

Bahadur Shah Zafar was a noted [[Urdu poetry|Urdu poet]], and wrote a large number of Urdu ''[[ghazal]]s''. While some part of his opus was lost or destroyed during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], a large collection did survive, and was later compiled into the ''[[Kulliyyat-i-Zafar]].'' The court that he maintained, although somewhat decadent and arguably pretentious for someone who was effectively a pensioner of the [[British East India Company]], was home to several Urdu writers of high standing, including [[Ghalib]], [[Nawab Mirza Khan Dagh|Dagh]], [[Mumin]], and [[Zauq]].

Emperor Bahadur Shah is seen by some in India as a freedom fighter (he was Commander-In-Chief of the mutiny army), fighting for India's independence from the Company. As the last ruling member of the imperial [[Timurid Dynasty]] he was surprisingly composed and calm when Major [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|Hodson]] presented decapitated heads of his own sons to him as [[Nowruz]] gifts. He is famously remembered to have said.<ref name="ReferenceA">[Page 24  The eighth section of the series on the mutiny of Delhi, Published for the second time in 1922 by Ibne Arbi]</ref><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== Role in the Rebellion of 1857 ===
[[File:Portrait of Bahadur Shah,.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the [[Mughal Emperor]] Bahadur Shah II.]]
On May 11 the regiments that had rebelled at [[Meerut]] the previous day reached Delhi and asked for a formal audience with Bahadur Shah which was granted the next day. It was attended by several excited sepoys who treated him familiarly or even disrespectfully.<ref name="Dalrymple, p.212">Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p.212</ref> Although Bahadur Shah was dismayed by the looting and disorder, he gave his public support to the rebellion. On 16 May, sepoys and palace servants killed 52 Europeans who had been held prisoner within the palace or who had been discovered hiding in the city. The killings took place under a peepul tree in front of the palace, despite Bahadur Shah's protests. The avowed aim of the killers was to implicate Bahadur Shah in the killings, making it impossible for him to seek any compromise with the British.<ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p.223-5</ref>

Bahadur Shah issued the following decree, a ''[[Shah]]i [[Firman]]'' (King's decree), on May 12, 1857:

<blockquote>To all the Hindus and Muslims of India, taking my duty by the people into consideration at this hour, I have decided to stand by my people. Whoever shows cowardice at this delicate hour, or whoever in innocence will help the cunning English, believing in their promises, he would stand disillusioned very soon. He should remember that the English will pay him for his faithfulness to them in the same manner as they have paid the rulers of [[Awadh|Oudh]]. It is the imperative duty of Hindus and ''Mussalmans'' (Muslims) to join the revolt against the English. They should work and be guided by their leaders in their towns and should take steps to restore order in the country. It is the bounden duty of all people that they should, as far as possible, copy out this ''Firman'' and display it at all important places in the towns. But before doing so, they should get themselves armed and declare war on the English.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}</blockquote>

The administration of the city and its new occupying army was chaotic, although it continued to function haphazardly. The Emperor nominated his eldest surviving son, [[Mirza Mughal]], to be commander in chief of his forces, but Mirza Mughal had little military experience and was treated with little respect by the sepoys. Nor did the sepoys agree on any overall commander, with each regiment refusing to accept orders from any but their own officers. Although Mirza Mughal made efforts to put the civil administration in order, his writ extended no further than the city.

Bahadur Shah Zafar was a devout [[Sufi]].<ref name=Dalrymple5/>  Zafar was himself regarded as a Sufi [[pir (Sufism)|Pir]] and used to accept ''murids'' or pupils.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> The loyalist newspaper ''Delhi Urdu Akhbaar'' once called him one of the leading saints of the age, approved of by the divine court.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> Prior to his accession, in his youth he made it a point to live and look like a poor scholar and [[dervish]], in stark contrast to his three well dressed dandy brothers, Mirza Jahangir, Salim and Babur.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> In 1828, when Zafar was 53 and a decade before he succeeded the throne, Major Archer reported, ''"Zafar is a man of spare figure and stature, plainly apparelled, almost approaching to meanness.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> His appearance is that of an indigent munshi or teacher of languages".''<ref name=Dalrymple5>William Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p. 78</ref>

As a poet and dervish, Zafar imbibed the highest subtleties of mystical Sufi teachings.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> At the same time, he was deeply susceptible to the magical and superstitious side of Orthodox Sufism.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> Like many of his followers, he believed that his position as both a Sufi pir and emperor gave him tangible spiritual powers.<ref name=Dalrymple5/> In an incident in which one of his followers was bitten by a snake, Zafar attempted to cure him by sending a "[[Bezoar|seal of Bezoar]]" (a stone antidote to poison) and some water on which he had breathed, and giving it to the man to drink.<ref name=Dalrymple1/>

The emperor also had a staunch belief in ''ta'aviz'' or charms, especially as a palliative for his constant complaint of piles, or to ward off evil spells.<ref name=Dalrymple1/> During one period of illness, he gathered a group of Sufi pirs and told them that several of his wives suspected that some party or the other had cast a spell over him.<ref name=Dalrymple1/> Therefore, he requested them to take some steps to remedy this so as to remove all apprehension on this account. They replied that they would write off some charms for him. They were to be mixed in water which when drunk would protect him from the evil eye. A coterie of pirs, miracle workers and Hindu astrologers were in constant attendance to the emperor. On their advice, he regularly sacrificed buffaloes and camels, buried eggs and arrested alleged black magicians, in addition to wearing a special ring that cured indigestion. On their advice, he also regularly donated cows to the poor, elephants to the sufi shrines and a horse to the ''khadims'' or clergy of [[Jama Masjid]].<ref name=Dalrymple1>William Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p. 79</ref>

Zafar consciously saw his role as a protector of his Hindu subjects, and a moderator of extreme Muslim demands and the intense puritanism of many of the Orthodox Muslim sheikhs of the [[Ulema]].<ref name=Dalrymple4/> In one of his verses, Zafar explicitly stated that both [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] shared the same essence.<ref name=Dalrymple4/> This syncretic philosophy was implemented by his court which came to cherish and embody a multicultural composite Hindu-Islamic Mughal culture.<ref name=Dalrymple4/> For instance, the Hindu elite used to frequently visit the ''[[dargah]]'' or tomb of the great [[Sufi]] pir, [[Nizam-ud-din Auliya]].<ref name=Dalrymple4/> They could quote [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and were very fond of Persian poetry.<ref name=Dalrymple4/> Their children, especially those belonging to the administrative [[Khatri]] and [[Kayastha]] castes studied under maulvis and attended the more liberal [[madrasa]]s, bringing food offerings for their teachers on Hindu festivals.<ref name=Dalrymple4/> On the other hand, the emperor's Muslim subjects emulated him in honouring the Hindu holy men, while many in court, including Zafar himself, followed the old Mughal custom, originally borrowed from high class Hindus, of only drinking the water from the [[Ganges]].<ref name=Dalrymple4>William Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p. 80</ref>

[[File:Autograph of His Majesty Bahadur Shah of Delhi 29th April 1844.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Autograph of Bahadur Shah of Delhi dated 29th April 1844.]]
Zafar and his court used to celebrate Hindu festivals.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> During the spring festival of [[Holi]], he would spray his courtiers, wives and concubines with different coloured paints, initiating the celebrations by bathing in the water of seven wells.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> The autumn Hindu festival of [[Vijayadashami|Dusshera]] was celebrated in the palace by the distribution of ''nazrs'' or presents to Zafar's Hindu officers and the colouring of the horses in the royal stud.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> In the evening, Zafar would then watch the ''Ram Lila'' processions annually celebrated in Delhi with the burning of giant effigies of Ravana and his brothers.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> He even went to the extent of demanding that the route of the procession be changed so that it would skirt the entire flank of the palace, allowing it to be enjoyed in all its glory.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> On [[Diwali]], Zafar would weigh himself against seven kinds of grain, gold, coral, etc., and directed their distribution among the city's poor.<ref name=Dalrymple3>William Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p. 81</ref>

He was reputedly known to have profound sensitivities to the feelings of his Hindu subjects.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> One evening, when Zafar was riding out across the river for an airing, a Hindu waited on the king and disclosed his wish to become a Muslim. Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, Zafar's prime minister flatly denied this request and the emperor had him removed from his presence.<ref name=Dalrymple3/> During the ''[[Phoolwalon-ki-sair|Phulwalon ki Sair]]'' or Flower-sellers fair held annually at the ancient [[Jog Maya Temple]] and the Sufi dargah of Qutb Sahib, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]] in [[Mehrauli]], Zafar declared that he would not accompany the ''pankah'' into the shrine as he could not accompany it into the temple.<ref name=Dalrymple3/>

==Zafar Mahal==
[[File:One of six figures from the Mughal emperor's ceremonial procession on the occasion of the Id..jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mughal Emperor]] Bahadur Shah II's ceremonial procession on the occasion of the [[Eid ul-Fitr]].]]

Closely woven into the history of the last remains of Mughal rule is the history of [[Zafar Mahal]] in [[Mehrauli]], a locality of Delhi. Zafar Mahal was originally built by [[Akbar II]], but it was his son, Bahadur Shah Zafar, who constructed the gateway and added to the palace in the mid-19th century. Mehrauli was then a popular venue for hunting parties, picnics and jaunts, and the dargah was an added attraction. The emperor visited often with his retinue - and stayed in royal style at Zafar Mahal. Another interesting feature of Zafar Mahal is that it literally spans centuries. A plastered dome near the gate is probably 15th century; other sections are relatively newer and show definite signs of Western influences. There is, for instance, a fireplace in one of the walls that stands near the Moti Masjid. And the staircase to the balcony is a wide one with low steps - very unlike the steep, narrow staircases of most Indian Islamic architecture.

The balcony, with its 'jharokha<U+2019> windows, is where the emperor and his family could look out over the road. In Bahadurshah<U+2019>s time, the main Mehrauli-Gurgaon road passed in front of Zafar Mahal, and all passersby were expected to dismount as a sign of respect for the emperor. When the British refused to comply, Bahadurshah solved the problem creatively - he bought the surrounding land and diverted the road so that it would pass well away from Zafar Mahal! The [[Phool Walon Ki Sair]] gradually turned into a major three day celebration during the time when Bahadur Shah Zafar, son and successor to Akbar Shah Saani ruled from Delhi.

Zafar used to move his court to a building adjacent to the Shrine of [[Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki]] and stayed at [[Mehrauli]] for a week during the celebrations. The building where he stayed during the period was originally built by his father and Zafar added an impressive gate and a Baaraadari to the structure and renamed it [[Zafar Mahal]].

The celebrations spread out in different parts of Mehrauli with the [[Jahaz Mahal]], (a [[Lodhi dynasty|Lodhi]] period structure, that was once in the middle of the [[Hauz-i-Shamsi|Hauz-e-Shamsi]] but is now at one end of the much depleted Hauz, becoming a center where [[Qawwali]] mehfils would be organised while the Jharna, built by [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]] and later added to by Akbar Shah II became a place where the women of the court relaxed.

==Events of 1857==
[[File:The capture of the king of delhi by Captain Hodson.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Capture of [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] and his sons by [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]] at [[Humayun's tomb]] on 20 September 1857]]
[[Image:Bahadur Shah Zafar.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bahadur Shah Zafar in 1858, just after his trial in [[Delhi]] and before his departure for [[exile]] in [[Rangoon]]. This is possibly the only photograph ever taken of a Mughal emperor.]]
As the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] spread, Sepoy regiments seized [[Delhi]]. Seeking a figure that could unite all Indians, [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] alike, most rebelling Indian kings and the Indian regiments accepted Zafar as the [[Emperor of India]].,<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070510/1857/main1.htm</ref> under whom the smaller Indian kingdoms would unite until the British were defeated. Zafar was the least threatening and least ambitious of monarchs, and the legacy of the [[Mughal Empire]] was more acceptable a uniting force to most allied kings than the domination of any other Indian kingdom.

On 12 May, Bahadur Shah held his first formal audience for several years. It was attended by several excited sepoys who treated him familiarly or even disrespectfully.<ref name="Dalrymple, p.212"/> Although Bahadur Shah was dismayed by the looting and disorder, he gave his public support to the rebellion. On 16 May, sepoys and palace servants killed 52 Europeans who had been held prisoner within the palace or who had been discovered hiding in the city. The executions took place under a peepul tree in front of the palace, despite Bahadur Shah's protests. The avowed aim of the executioners was to implicate Bahadur Shah in the killings, making it impossible for him to seek any compromise with the British.<ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p.223</ref>

The administration of the city and its new occupying army was chaotic and troublesome, although it continued to function haphazardly. The Emperor nominated his eldest surviving son, [[Mirza Mughal]], to be commander in chief of his forces, but Mirza Mughal had little military experience and was treated with little respect by the sepoys. Nor did the sepoys agree on any overall commander, with each regiment refusing to accept orders from any but their own officers. Although Mirza Mughal made efforts to put the civil administration in order, his writ extended no further than the city. Outside, [[Gujjar]] herders began levying their own tolls on traffic, and it became increasingly difficult to feed the city.<ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Mughal'', p.145 fn</ref>

When the victory of the British became certain, Bahadur Shah took refuge at [[Humayun's Tomb]], in an area that was then at the outskirts of Delhi, and hid there. Company forces led by [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|Major William Hodson]] surrounded the tomb and compelled his surrender on 20 September 1857. The next day Hodson shot his sons Mirza Mughal, Mirza Khizr Sultan, and grandson Mirza Abu Bakr under his own authority at the [[Khooni Darwaza]] (the bloody gate) near [[Delhi Gate (Delhi)|Delhi Gate]]. On hearing the news Bahadur Shah reacted with shocked silence while his wife [[Zeenat Mahal]] was content as she believed her son was now Bahadur Shah's heir.

[[File:"A Mogul Trooper" (James S. Virtue Co., London, 1858).jpg|thumb|A Mughal Troopers gather in their attempts to defend their emperor Bahadur Shah II during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].]]

Many male members of his family were killed by Company forces, who imprisoned or exiled the surviving members of the Mughal dynasty. Bahadur Shah was tried on four counts, two of aiding rebels, one of treason, and being party to the murder of 49 people,<ref>Charges against Mahomed Bahadoor Shah, ex-King of Delhi reprinted in Perth Inquirer & Commercial News, 7 April 1858</ref> and after a forty day trial found guilty on all charges. Respecting [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|Hodson]]'s guarantee on his surrender Bahadur Shah was not sentenced but  exiled to [[Rangoon]], Burma  in 1858. He was accompanied into exile by  his wife [[Zeenat Mahal]] and some of the remaining members of the family. His departure as Emperor marked the end of more than three centuries of Mughal rule in India.

==Death and burial==
Bahadur Shah died in exile on 7 November 1862 in Rangoon, (now Yangon). He was buried in [[Yangon]]'s [[Dagon Township]] near the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], at the site that later became known as Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://india.nydailynews.com/article/ebf03b644bbe4df65effb9e958c49f71/pm-to-pay-homage-to-last-mughal-emperor|title=PM to pay homage to last Mughal emperor|date=27 May 2012|work=Daily News|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kapadia.com/Dargah/zafrdarg.html The Dargah of Bahadur Shah Zafar in Rangoon.]</ref> At the time of his hurried burial in 1862, a bamboo fence surrounded his grave, which was grown over by grass in the following years, thus the exact spot was lost for nearly a century. In 1991, during a restoration exercise behind the shrine which was till then believed to be that of the Emperor, the original brick-lined grave  was discovered. To the local Myanmar Muslims, he was honoured as a saint and a new shrine was built in the coming years<ref>{{cite news |title=At dynasty<U+2019>s end: Bahadur Shah Zafar, more poet than ruler, would have been happy with his final resting place|url=http://www.livemint.com/2012/06/01205722/At-dynasty8217s-end.html |publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)]], Lounge |date=Jun 1 2012 }}</ref><ref name=cnn12>{{cite news |title=PM visits Bahadur Shah Zafar's memorial in Myanmar|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/pm-visits-bahadur-shah-zafars-memorial-in-myanmar/1004750.html |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=May 29, 2012 }}</ref> His wife [[Zeenat Mahal]], who died in 1886 and granddaughter Raunaq Zamani are buried along side him.<ref name=cnn12/><ref>[http://www.kapadia.com/zeenatmahal.html Nawab Zeenat Mahal]</ref>

In a marble enclosure adjoining the [[dargah]] of Sufi saint, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]] at [[Mehrauli]], an empty grave or ''Sardgah'' marks the site where he had willed to be buried along with some of his Mughal predecessors,  [[Akbar Shah II]], [[Bahadur Shah I]] (also known as [[Shah Alam I]]) and [[Shah Alam II]].

In 1959, the All India Bahadur Shah Zafar Academy was founded expressly to spread awareness of his contribution to the first major anti-British movement in India. Several movies in [[Hindi]] or [[Urdu]] have depicted his role during the rebellion of 1857.  [[Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg|Roads bearing his name]] are found in [[New Delhi]], [[Lahore]], [[Varanasi]], and other cities.  A statue of Bahadur Shah Zafar has been erected at the Vijayanagaram palace in [[Varanasi]].  In [[Bangladesh]], the [[Victoria Park, Dhaka|Victoria Park]] in old [[Dhaka]] has been renamed "[[Bahadur Shah Zafar Park]]".  And in several [[Pakistan]]i cities, avenues, roads, shopping centres, and other landmarks carry the name of the last Mughal emperor.

Tell these longings to go dwell elsewhere<br>

In his book, [[The Last Mughal]], [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] states that, according to Lahore scholar Imran Khan, the verse beginning ''umr-e-dar<U+0101>z m<U+0101><U+0144>g ke'' ("I asked for a long life") is probably not by Zafar, and does not appear in any of the works published during Zafar's lifetime.  The verse appears to be by Simab Akbarabadi.<ref>https://mailman.rice.edu/pipermail/sasialit/2008-January/013250.html</ref>
