Agoncillo was a daughter of a rich family in her home town in [[Taal, Batangas]]. As a lady, she was called "Roselang Hubog" by the local townsfolk. Finishing her studies at [[Sta. Catalina|Sta. Catalina College]], she acquired her learning in [[music]] and feminine crafts. At the age of 30, Agoncillo married lawyer and jurist [[Felipe Agoncillo|Don Felipe Agoncillo]] and bore him six children.

As a wife of a Filipino diplomat, Agoncillo once played an important role in Philippine history. When her husband exiled to [[Hong Kong]] during the outbreak of the [[Philippine Revolution]], Agoncillo and the rest of the family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti-Filipino hostility of some foreign countries. While in Hong Kong, [[General Emilio Aguinaldo]] requested her to sew a flag that would represent their [[Philippines|country]]. Agoncillo, her eldest daughter and a friend manually sewed the flag in accordance with General Aguinaldo's design which later became the official flag of the Philippines.

While the flag itself is the perpetual legacy of Agoncillo,<ref name="ManilaBul"/> she is also commemorated through museums and monuments like the marker in Hong Kong where her family temporarily sojourned, at her ancestral home in Taal, Batangas which has been turned into a museum,<ref>{{Citation |last=Culture Dept. of Education, and Sports, Philippines |first= |last2= |first2= |publication-date=1989

Six daughters were born to them: Lorenza ("Enchang"), Gregoria ("Goring"), Eugenia ("Nene"), Marcela ("Celing", named after her mother because they thought she would be their last child), Adela (who died at the age of three) and the youngest, Maria ("Maring", who was their last surviving child and died on [[July 6]], [[1995]]). Most of her daughters became teachers. Gregoria was the first Filipina to graduate from [[Oxford University]].<ref name="delR"/> After the graduation of the three elders, they were offered teaching positions. Lorenza was given the appointment to teach in Malate Catholic School.<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |publication-date= |title=Reminiscences of the Agoncillo Family |publication-place= |publisher= |isbn= |page=42 |url= |accessdate=[[2007]]-[[11-29]]}}.</ref> They so immersed themselves in their respective teaching careers that not one of them chose to be married.<ref name="delR"/> She raised her daughters until they grew mature.

No one ever left their house empty-handed. Agoncillo would hand them a bag of rice in addition to the money she gave them. This practice lasted until the couple reached maturity.<ref name="delR"/>

== Living in Hong Kong ==
After the plan of the governor-general to deport Don Felipe, he sailed to Yokohama, Japan but briefly stayed and went to Hong Kong where he joined other Filipino exiles who found asylum when the revolution broke out in 1896. Twenty-two months after the departure of Don Felipe for Hong Kong, Agoncillo and the rest of the family (her last two daughters were not yet born) followed him into exile. They rented a house at 535 Morrison Hill in the [[Wan Chai district]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/paniqui_embry/alliedfam/aqwn05.htm |title=Selected Families and Individuals |accessdate=2007-11-05 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=''Members.tripod.com''}}</ref> While in Hong Kong, Agoncillo gave birth to their last child on [[March 22]], [[1906]].<ref name="FFD"/>

Felipe, being an exile himself, received any Filipino who came into their house. Thereafter, the place became a sanctuary for other Filipino revolutionary exiles. They initiated meetings in the Agoncillos' residence, especially during the critical months of March and April 1898. Among these folks were Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] and Gen. Aguinaldo. Also, [[Josephine Bracken]], [[Jose Rizal]]'s fianc<U+00E9>e, sought refuge in their house when the Spanish authorities threatened to torture her.<ref name="delR2"/>

After the signing of the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] on [[December 14]], [[1897]], General Aguinaldo, after their voluntary exile, visited the Agoncillo residence in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Citation |last=Saulo |first=Alfredo B. |last2= |first2= |publication-date=1983

On [[May 17]], [[1898]], the flag was delivered personally by Agoncillo<ref name="TPR"/> and was packed among the things Aguinaldo brought back to Manila. This was the flag that was hoisted from the window of Aguinaldo's house in [[Kawit, Cavite]], during the proclamation of [[Philippine independence]] on [[June 12]], [[1898]] accompanied by the Philippine National Anthem ''Marcha Filipina''.<ref name="Intro"/><ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |publication-date=

In response to the message written by Gen. Aguinaldo, Agoncillo wrote the following statement when she wan interviewed:

{{quote|In the house at 535 Morrison Hill, where I lived with my family, exiled from our country on account of the national cause, I had the good fortune to make the first Philippine flag under the direction of an illust[r]ious leader Gen.

== Post-exile and death ==
Agoncillo and her daughters stayed in Hong Kong from 1895 to 1906. She took care of their house, which became an asylum. Their funds had run out because of the heavy expenses incurred by Don Felipe for his diplomatic activities in [[France]] and in the [[United States]]. She once had to sell children pinafores<ref name="delR"/> and their jewels<ref name="delR2"/> to support her family and to pay for their voyage back to Manila. The other money was also used to help boost the revolutionary funds. Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Don Felipe returned to his services.<ref name="ManilaBul">{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/06/24/OPED2006062467632.html |title=146th Birth Anniversary of Do<U+00F1>a Marcela Mari<U+00F1>o Agoncillo |accessdate=2007-11-21 |format= |work=The Manila Bulletin Online |publisher=''Mb.com.ph''}}</ref>

After the fall of the [[first Philippine Republic]] and the establishment of the American regime, Agoncillo and her family ended their exile and went back to Manila as soon as they were fetched by Don Felipe after his diplomatic activities abroad had ended.<ref>{{Citation |last=de Ocampo |first=Esteban A. |last2=Saulo |first2=Alfredo B. |publication-date=

After the death of Don Felipe, Agoncillo's remaining family suffered from starvation due to their meager supply of food, water and other needs. The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] conquerors also contributed to their anguish during the period of the Japanese invasion.<ref name="Geo"/> Taking this all in stride, Marcela remained pragmatic and a source of inspiration. After their house was incinerated during the Japanese occupation, all she said to her remaining daughters was "We will then have to go to Taal."

Though she endured the 1945 [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], the health of
Agoncillo, who was alternatively called "Do<U+00F1>a Marcela" and "Lola Celay" during her old age,<ref name="delR"/> was steadily deteriorating.

On [[November 27]], [[1955]], a marker was erected by the National Historical Institute of the Philippines and a [[museum]] was established in Taal, Batangas in accordance with her last wish before she died and was named Marcela Marino Agoncillo Museum and Monument.
