The '''Bugatti Model 100''' was a purpose built [[Air racing|air racer]] designed to compete in the 1939 [[Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe|Deutsch de la Meurthe Cup Race]]. The aircraft was not completed by the September 1939 deadline and was put in storage prior to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]].

==Development==
[[Ettore Bugatti]] started work in 1938 to design a racer to compete in the Deutsch de la Meurthe Cup Race, using engines sold in his automotive line for co-marketing. His chief engineer was [[Louis de Monge]], whom Bugatti was partnered with before. Bugatti also approached by the French Government to use the technology of the racing aircraft to develop a fighter variant for mass production. The aircraft was the source of five modern patents including the inline engines, V tail mixer controls, and the automatic flap system. <ref>{{cite web|title=Resurrecting the Bugatti Racer|url=http://www.eaa.org/news/2009/2009-10-23_bugatti.asp|accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref>

==Design==
The Model 100 had a unusual inboard mounted twin engine arrangement driving forward mounted twin counter rotating propellers through driveshafts. The aircraft also featured a 120 degree [[V-tail]] arrangement and [[retractable landing gear]]. The construction was mostly of wood, with sandwiched layers of balsa and hardwoods, including tulipwood stringers covered with [[aircraft fabric covering|doped fabric]].

==Operational history==
The aircraft remained in storage throughout [[World War II]]. The aircraft was sold several times, and its twin Bugatti 50P engines were removed for automotive restorations. In 1971 a restoration effort was started. The aircraft was stored by the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], then transferred to the [[EAA Airventure Museum]] collection where restoration was completed, and the aircraft remains on static display.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bugatti Model 100|url=http://museum.eaa.org/collection/aircraft/Bugatti%20Model%20100%20Racer.asp#TopOfPage|accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>
