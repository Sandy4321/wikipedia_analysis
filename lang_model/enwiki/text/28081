==Race==

Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the [[Surrey]] station, handing the [[Middlesex]] side of the river to Cambridge.  The race was started by umpire Raikes at 6:15&nbsp;p.m,<ref name=burn76/> in "rain and dismal weather".<ref name=easyrace>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge have an easy race | work = [[The Observer]] | first = G. I. F. | last = Thomson | date = 30 March 1947 | page = 8}}</ref>  [[Stroke rate|Out-rating]] Oxford by two strokes per minute, the Light Blues took an immediate lead and by Craven Steps they were pulling away from their opponents.  As both crews passed the Mile Post, Cambridge were almost clear by two lengths, and despite a spurt from the Dark Blues at the [[Harrods Furniture Depository]], the Light Blues maintained their lead.  Oxford trailed Cambridge by three and a half lengths as the Light Blues passed below [[Hammersmith Bridge]] and moved into Oxford's water, effectively ending the race as a contest.<ref name=easy/>

Cambridge continued to build their lead, ahead by six lengths at Chiswick Steps and eight by [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].<ref name=easy/>  They passed the finishing post ten lengths ahead in a time of 23 minutes 1 second, their first win since the [[The Boat Race 1939|1939 race]].  It was the slowest winning time since the 1877 race and the winning margin was the largest since the [[The Boat Race 1928|1928 race]].  The victory took the overall record in the event to 49<U+2013>43 in Cambridge's favour.<ref name=results/>  The rowing correspondent for ''The Times'' suggested the "Boat Race was as disappointing as the weather in which it was rowed".<ref name=easy>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge's easy victory | work = [[The Times]] | date = 31 March 1947 | page = 2 | issue = 50723}}</ref>
