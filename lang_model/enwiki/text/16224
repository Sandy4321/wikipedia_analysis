{{Falklands War}}

On 6 June 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], the British Royal Navy [[Type 42 destroyer]] {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} engaged and destroyed British Army Gazelle ''XX377'' in a [[friendly fire]] incident, killing all on board. ''Cardiff'', on the lookout for aircraft flying supplies to the Argentine forces occupying the [[Falkland Islands]], had misidentified the helicopter as an enemy [[C-130 Hercules]]. Although the helicopter's loss was initially blamed on enemy action, a subsequent inquiry found ''Cardiff''{{'}}s missiles to be the cause.

On the night of 5 June, HMS ''Cardiff'' was stationed to the east of the islands to both provide gunfire support to the land forces and to intercept enemy aircraft. At around 02:00 a radar contact was detected; a British [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopter was making a routine delivery of personnel and equipment to a radio rebroadcast station on [[East Falkland]]. From the contact's speed and course, ''Cardiff''{{'}}s operations room crew assumed it to be hostile.  Two [[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]] missiles were fired, destroying the target. The Gazelle's wreckage and crew were discovered the next morning, and the loss was attributed to enemy fire. Although ''Cardiff'' was suspected, later scientific tests on the wreckage proved inconclusive.

However, no formal inquiry was held until four years later. Defending their claim that the helicopter had been lost in action, the United Kingdom's [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) stated that they had not wanted to "cause further anguish to relatives" while they were still trying to ascertain how the Gazelle been shot down. The board of inquiry recommended that "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual",<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> but identified a number of factors. A lack of communication between the army and the navy meant that [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] had not notified anyone of the helicopter's flight. Conversely, the navy had not informed the land forces that ''Cardiff'' had changed position to set up an ambush for Argentine aircraft travelling over the area. Furthermore, the helicopter's [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) transmitter was turned off, because it caused interference with the army's [[Rapier missile|Rapier]] anti-aircraft missile system. The board of inquiry's findings have prompted criticism of the MoD's initial response to the incident.

On the night of 5 June, the British [[Type 42 destroyer]] {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} took up station on the "Bluff Cove Gunline" to the east of the islands. Tasked with a dual mission, ''Cardiff'' was to provide [[naval gunfire support|fire support]] to the marines of [[3 Commando Brigade]], and to interdict any Argentine aircraft attempting to fly into Stanley. The destroyer had performed a similar role four nights previously, when she unsuccessfully attempted to shoot down a resupply aircraft as it landed, and again as it took off.<ref name="L/Cpl. S. J.

The helicopter's wreckage was inspected on-site, but the British were unable to determine if it had been destroyed by ''Cardiff''{{'}}s missiles or by Argentine fire. This uncertainty prompted the decision not to hold a board of inquiry, and ''XX377'' was declared "lost in action". It was surmised that, if the relatives of the deceased were told that the Gazelle may have been lost to [[friendly fire]], it would add to their grief.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> After the war, missile fragments found in the wreckage were taken to the British government's aviation research facility at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] for analysis. The scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British Sea Dart missile, despite a Sea Dart casing later being found "several hundred yards" away from the wreckage.<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/>

In December 1982, an inquest was held by a [[Southampton]] coroner into the death of Lance Corporal Cockton after his body was repatriated to the UK. Based on RAE Farnborough's test results, the Army Air Corps submitted evidence stating that the analysis of the warhead fragments found in the wreckage indicated that the helicopter had been destroyed by a type of anti-aircraft missile "known to have been in the possession of the enemy".<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> The test results were reviewed in November 1985, with the conclusion that there could be "no definitive conclusion as to the exact source of the missile fragments recovered from the crash site".<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> In June 1986, [[John Stanley (politician)|John Stanley]], the [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]], announced in his written answers to the House of Commons: "the [Southampton] coroner has been informed accordingly."<ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/>

The board of inquiry found that standard operating procedure dictated that the commanders of 5th Infantry Brigade were not required to declare the helicopter's mission to any other authority, as the flight was to occur in brigade airspace on a brigade task.<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/><ref name="L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton"/> Gazelle ''XX377'' was equipped with an IFF transmitter, but this was turned off. In the opinion of the board, "had IFF been in use there is little doubt that Cardiff would not have engaged the aircraft that night."<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> At the time, less than half of the land force's helicopters were fitted with IFF transmitters, and those that were had been ordered not to use them because they inhibited the tracking systems of the British ground-based [[Rapier missile|Rapier]] anti-aircraft missile batteries.<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/><ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)"/> A misconception about the Royal Navy's ability to engage air targets over land led to the navy not being informed that the army's helicopters were not using IFF. The board of inquiry concluded that it was this failure to communicate, together with the navy's assumption that all helicopters would be operating IFF, which "had a cumulative effect [and] was a major cause of [the] accident."<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> However, the board recommended that "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual".<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/>

Given that the role of helicopters in land force operations was increasing, as was the integration of [[guided missile destroyer]]s for coastal defence, the board of inquiry recommended an amendment to [[NATO]] procedures for [[amphibious warfare]] and [[naval gunfire support]], to alert other armed forces to the danger of underestimating a ship's missile engagement zone over land.<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/> During the late 1980s, the British government placed more emphasis on [[joint warfare]] training, with exercises, such as [[Exercise Purple Warrior|Purple Warrior]], taking place in [[Oman]] and Scotland.<ref name="MOD board of inquiry"/><ref name="L/Cpl.
