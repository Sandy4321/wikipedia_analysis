'''Hurricane Flora''' is among the [[List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|deadliest]] [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]]s in [[recorded history]], with a death total of over 7,000. The seventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the [[1963 Atlantic hurricane season]], Flora developed from a disturbance in the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] on September 26 while located {{convert|755|mi|km}} southwest of the [[Cape Verde]] islands. After remaining a weak depression for several days, it rapidly organized on September 29 to attain tropical storm status. Flora continued to quickly strengthen to reach [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane status before moving through the [[Windward Islands]] and passing over [[Tobago]], and it reached [[maximum sustained wind]]s of {{convert|145|mph|km/h}} in the Caribbean.

The storm struck southwestern [[Haiti]] near peak intensity, turned to the west, and drifted over [[Cuba]] for four days before turning to the northeast. Flora passed over the [[Bahamas]] and accelerated northeastward, becoming an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October 12. Due to its slow movement across Cuba, Flora is the wettest known tropical cyclone for Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roth, David M|year=2008|title=Hurricane Flora&nbsp;<U+2014> September 29&nbsp;<U+2013> October 8, 1963|author2=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=June 9, 2012|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/flora1963.html}}</ref> The significant casualties caused by Flora were the most for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin since the [[1900 Galveston Hurricane]].<ref name="GORDON63"/>

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Flora 1963 track.png}}
A disturbance in the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] organized into a tropical depression on September 26 while located about {{convert|755|mi|km}} southwest of the island of [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. Upon forming, the depression had a poorly organized circulation with [[rainbands|banding features]] to its north and east. The depression moved west-northwestward, and the system failed to organize significantly by a day after developing. On September 27, the banding features dissipated, though the area of convection around the center increased. Satellite imagery was unavailable until September 30, during which there were not sufficient ship reports to indicate the presence of a low-level circulation. The depression continued west-northwestward, and it is estimated it intensified into Tropical Storm Flora on September 29 while located about {{convert|560|mi|km}} east-southeast of [[Trinidad]], or about {{convert|350|mi|km}} north of [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]]. Operationally, advisories were not initiated until a day later.<ref name="GORDON63">{{cite journal|author1=Dunn, Gordon E|author2=Moore, Paul L|author3=Clark Gilbert B|journal=Monthly Weather Review|author4=Frank, Neil L|author5=Hill, Elbert C|author6=Kraft, Raymond H|author7=Sugg, Arnold L|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/092/mwr-092-03-0128.pdf|year=1964|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68ITM1MgI|title=The Hurricane Season of 1963|accessdate=May 13, 2012|doi=10.1175/1520-0493-92.3.128|issn=0027-0644|page=136|volume=92|issue=3|archivedate=June 9, 2012|deadurl=no|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>

Flora quickly intensified after it became a tropical storm, and early on September 30 it attained hurricane status. Later that day, [[Hurricane Hunters|Reconnaissance Aircraft]] confirmed the existence of the hurricane, with the flight reporting a well-defined, circular {{convert|8|mi|km|sing=on}} wide [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. One observer noted Flora to be the best organized tropical cyclone over the previous two years. After attaining major hurricane status, Flora passed directly over the island of [[Tobago]] late on the 30th with winds of {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The hurricane continued west-northwestward as it entered the Caribbean, and early on October 2 its winds reached {{convert|140|mph|km/h}}. Thirty hours later, Flora intensified slightly further and attained peak winds of {{convert|145|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} while located about {{convert|105|mi|km}} south of the border of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name="GORDON63"/>

After turning to the northwest, Hurricane Flora maintained its peak strength, and made landfall in the [[Sud Department]] of Haiti late on October 3 as a {{convert|145|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson Scale]] with gusts from {{convert|180|to|200|mph|km/h}}.<ref name="tcr3"/> The calm of the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] lasted for up to 70&nbsp;minutes in one location.<ref name="mic2">{{cite web|author=Ralph L.

A [[anticyclone|high pressure system]] to its north turned the motion of the hurricane to a westward drift, causing it to weaken quickly over land. Flora neared the north coast of [[Cuba]] on October 4 before turning to the south. It executed a cyclonic loop and entered the coastal waters off [[Granma Province]]. An anticyclone to the west of Flora turned the hurricane to the north, bringing it ashore near [[Santa Cruz del Sur]] on October 7 with winds of around {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Flora initially turned southeastward over central Cuba, and late on October 8 a [[trough (meteorology)|short-wave trough]] turned the hurricane northeastward, bringing it into the coastal waters of the [[Holgu<U+00ED>n Province]].<ref name="GORDON63"/> Flora remained a hurricane while drifting over land due to abundant moisture and a favorable upper level environment.<ref name="tcr3">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1963|title=Hurricane Flora Preliminary Report Page Three|accessdate=November 27, 2006|publisher=[[United States Weather Bureau]]|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1963/flora/prenhc/prelim03.gif}}</ref>

After passing over the southeastern [[Bahamas]] early on October 9, Flora began to restrengthen, and on October 10 it again reached major hurricane status while located {{convert|290|mi|km}} south of [[Bermuda]]. The hurricane gradually weakened as it continued northeastward, and weakened to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on October 11. Flora gradually lost its convection over the north Atlantic Ocean, and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October 12 while located {{convert|270|mi|km}} east-southeast of [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The extratropical remnant dissipated the next day.<ref name="GORDON63"/>

==Preparations==
The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Weather Bureau]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warning]] for [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], and the [[Grenadines]] south of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] in the cyclone's first advisory on Hurricane Flora. Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern [[Venezuela]]<ref name="tcr3"/> and from Saint Vincent northward to [[Martinique]]. Advisories on Flora emphasized the danger of the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the [[Windward Islands]] to remain at harbor and for shipping in the path of the hurricane to advise extreme caution.<ref name="tcr4">{{cite web|author=Higgs|year=1963|title=Hurricane Flora Advisories (Page 4)|publisher=[[United States Weather Bureau]]|accessdate=November 28, 2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1963/flora/prenhc/prelim04.gif}}</ref> People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well.<ref name="tcr5">{{cite web|author=Hoose & Davis|year=1963|title=Hurricane Flora Advisories (Page 5)|publisher=San Juan Weather Bureau|accessdate=November 28, 2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1963/flora/prenhc/prelim05.gif}}</ref> Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struck.<ref name="eval2">{{cite web|author=U.S. Weather Bureau|year=1963|title=Report of Preliminary Evaluation of Warning Services, Hurricane Flora|accessdate=November 28, 2006|publisher=[[United States Weather Bureau]]|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1963/flora/prenhc/eval02.gif}}</ref>

On October 2, two days before it made landfall on southwestern [[Hispaniola]], the San Juan Weather Bureau issued a gale warning from [[Barahona (city)|Barahona]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] to the [[Sud-Est Department]] of [[Haiti]].

In [[Tobago]], the great agricultural damage from Flora caused the crop plantations to be abandoned. As a result, the economy of the island changed towards tourism.<ref name="tobagodive"/> The destruction of the Tobagonian rainforests resulted in a continual decline of agriculture on the island due to animals previously in the forest eating the crops for food.<ref name="tobnew1">{{cite web|author=Tobago News|publisher=Tobago News|year=2005|title=Cocrico killing agriculture|accessdate=November 28, 2006|url=http://www.thetobagonews.com/index.pl/article?id=3451662 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051028142439/http://www.thetobagonews.com/index.pl/article?id=3451662 |archivedate = October 28, 2005}}</ref> The passage of the hurricane reduced the height of the rainforest canopy above {{convert|800|ft|m}} by half.

In the [[Dominican Republic]], damage reports were largely unknown by a month after the hurricane passed the island, primarily in the [[Provinces of the Dominican Republic|western provinces]]. There, roads were still impassable, large areas remained without electricity, and helicopters could not land in remote areas due to mud, silt, and up to {{convert|3|ft|m}} of water in all landing fields. One official estimated several months would pass before survey teams could obtain information on loss of life and overall damages.<ref name="mic1">{{cite web|author=Ralph L.

Due to its impact on the Caribbean nations, the name '''Flora''' was retired after this year and was replaced by '''Fern'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EtAlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4HwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=hurricane%20names&pg=3748%2C4222769|title=Flora, There'll never be another you|date=October 9, 1963|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|year=2008|title=Retired Hurricane Names Since 1954|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 2, 2009|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml}}</ref>
