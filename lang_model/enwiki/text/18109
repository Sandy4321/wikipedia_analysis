"'''Gypsy'''" is a song by the rock group [[Fleetwood Mac]]. [[Stevie Nicks]] wrote the song originally circa 1979, and the earliest demo recordings were recorded in early 1980 with [[Tom Moncrieff]] for possible inclusion on her solo debut ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''. However, when Nicks' friend Robin Anderson died of [[leukemia]], the song took on a new inspiration and Nicks held it over for Fleetwood Mac.  "Gypsy" was the second single release and second biggest hit from the ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'' album following ''[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]''.  "Gypsy" reached #12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

A cover version of the song was featured in the "Silent Knight" episode of the television series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.

==Stevie Nicks' Inspiration for the Song==	
	There are two points of inspiration behind "Gypsy," as stated by Stevie Nicks.  The first of which is a point of nostalgia for Nicks; her life before Fleetwood Mac. Before joining the iconic band, Nicks lived with [[Lindsey Buckingham]], who would also join Fleetwood Mac. Nicks and Buckingham were partners in both the musical and romantic sense, however, only their musical partnership has survived. Nicks met Buckingham at a high school party, where he was singing [[California Dreaming]] by [[the Mamas and the Papas]]. Nicks joined in with perfect harmony, then they introduced themselves. They didn't see each other again until college, where they started a relationship, and started a duo called [[Buckingham Nicks]]. They barely got by with Nicks' waitress and cleaning-lady income.<ref>"Stevie Nicks Biography." The Fleetwood Mac Legacy. Web. <http://www.fmlegacy.com/Bios/biostevie.html>.</ref> They couldn't afford a bed frame, so they slept on a single mattress, directly on the floor. Nicks says the mattress was decorated in lace,  with a vase and a flower at its side. When she feels her famous life getting to her, she goes "back to her roots," and takes her mattress off of the frame "back to the floor," that she loved, and decorates it with "some lace, and paper flowers." <ref>"Stevie Nicks on Gypsy." Stevie Nicks In Her Own Words. Web. <http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy.htm>.</ref>  It takes her back to the days when she had no wealth- back to herself as a poor gypsy. Some speculate the rest of this song is directed at Buckingham, assuming the lyric depict her leaving him. 
On March 31, 2009, Nicks gave an interview to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' discussing the inspiration for the song:
<blockquote>
"Oh boy, I've never really spoken about this, so I get verklempt, and then I've got the story and I start to screw it up. Okay: In the old days, before Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey [Buckingham] and I had no money, so we had a king-size mattress, but we just had it on the floor. I had old vintage coverlets on it, and even though we had no money it was still really pretty... Just that and a lamp on the floor, and that was it<U+2014>there was a certain calmness about it. To this day, when I'm feeling cluttered, I will take my mattress off of my beautiful bed, wherever that may be, and put it outside my bedroom, with a table and a little lamp." </blockquote>

On March 25, 2009 during a show in Montreal on Fleetwood Mac's Unleashed Tour, Stevie Nicks gave a short history of the inspiration behind Gypsy. She explained it was written sometime in 1978-79, when the band had become "very famous, very fast," and it was a song that brought her back to an earlier time, to an apartment in San Francisco where she had taken the mattress off her bed and put it on the floor.  To contextualize, she voiced the lyrics: "So I'm back, to the velvet underground. Back to the floor, that I love. To a room with some lace and paper flowers. Back to the gypsy that I was." Those are the words: 'So I'm back to the velvet underground' <U+2014> which is a clothing store in downtown San Francisco, where Janis Joplin got her clothes, and Grace Slick from Jefferson Airplane, it was this little hole in the wall, amazing, beautiful stuff <U+2014> 'back to the floor that I love, to a room with some lace and paper flowers, back to the gypsy that I was.'
	
The second, and most emotional, subject of this song is the message as a tribute to someone's passing. On October 12, 1982, Robin Snyder Anderson, Stevie's best friend, died of [[leukemia]].

==Stevie Nicks and Robin Snyder Anderson==	
Nicks met Robin Snyder at Arcadia high school in Los Angeles , CA when they were either 14 or 15. Around this time, Nicks had written her first song, and played it for Snyder. After that, they became best friends. Snyder is theatrical, herself; she took part in a dance troup, choir, and a theatre club. She later became Nicks' speech therapist on tour, and helped her with her voice.<ref>"Stevie Nicks Story Pg3 - Arcadia High School ROCK Legends." Arcadia High School Reunions | Find Arcadia Apaches Online! Web. <http://www.arcadiaapaches.com/memories/rock_history/stevie_nicks_story3.htm>.</ref> Videos of the two preparing for concerts are easily accessible over the internet, for instance, one video in particular where Snyder helps Nicks prepare for a concert during the "Rumors" tour.<ref>{{cite web|author=now to post a comment! |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAekACkue6U |title=Stevie Nicks "Merlin" - Preparation before a show w/ Robin |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> Not only did she help her with her singing, but she was also her confidante, and the person who knew her best. According to Carol Ann Harris' book, "Storms", Snyder could calm her down within just a fraction of a second.<ref>Harris, Carol Ann. Storms: My Life with Lindsey Buckingham and Fleetwood Mac. Chicago, IL: Chicago Review, 2007. Print.</ref> The night before her "Bella Donna" was released, Nicks received a terrifying call from Snyder saying she had leukemia, and the doctors thought she could only last three months. Even more horrifying to Nicks was the news that Snyder had gotten pregnant, as to leave her husband, Kim Anderson, with something after she left. If she aborted the child, she could've possibly lived for another year. However, the baby was born (three months-premature), and Snyder died three days later. Nicks was on tour <ref>"Stevie Nicks on Robin Snyder Anderson." Stevie Nicks In Her Own Words. Web. <http://www.inherownwords.com/robin.htm>.</ref> The only person Nicks felt could understand her grief was Kim Anderson. He felt the same way, and out of grief, as well as the duty to give the baby (named Matthew) a good home, the two married. Three months later, Nicks filed for divorce, after she "received a sign" from Snyder telling her to get out of there. Nicks reportedly hasn't seen Matthew since. She says that she has a roomful of Snyder's things for him, when he's ready. 
As Snyder was dying, Nicks dedicated "Gypsy" to her. Nicks found it extremely difficult to sing the song in concert.
So that's what 'Gypsy' means: it's just a search for before this all happened. And later, I tacked on a line for my friend Robin, my best friend, who died of leukemia: 'I still see your bright eyes.' But then, Robin wasn't sick yet. She got cancer, and died within a year."<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/03/stevie-nicks-in.html |title=Stevie Nicks On Her Favorite Songs: A Music Mix Exclusivere &#124; The Music Mix &#124; EW.com |publisher=Music-mix.ew.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>

==Song Interpretations==
However, it has been established this song is about "Stevie Nicks remembering her roots" and, mainly, a tribute to Robin Anderson, many still leave it open to interpretation. The most popular interpretation that hasn't been confirmed by Nicks is the belief that many of the lyrics are not only directed towards Snyder, but to Lindsey Buckingham. This is very possible, as it has been said that the two still had feelings for each other for quite a few years after their split.<ref>Brunning, Bob. "The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and ..." Google Books. Web. <http://books.google.com/books?id=ONo06QrjRc4C&pg=PA116-IA8&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false>.</ref> Also, her lyrics are very cryptic, which make them open for wide interpretation.<ref>"Gypsy - Mirage." BuckinghamNicks.net -The Site That Sticks to Buckingham Nicks - Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, the Package Deal. Web. <http://www.buckinghamnicks.net/bn/mirage/gypsy.html>.</ref>

Here are some example lyrics from the song, as well as some interpretations:

"And it all comes down to you, Well, you know that it does, and lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice. Oh, and it lights up the night. You see your Gypsy."

Nicks has said in interviews that this refers to Robin, and how you can only come across a friend like her once possibly twice in a lifetime. The first part may refer to Nicks suddenly becoming alone. The "Gypsy" throughout the song, especially in respect to this song being a tribute, refers to either Nicks or Snyder, representing their separation. However, The same could be said about Lindsey; maybe he was her "maybe once, maybe twice" soulmate. The "you" this time, could refer to Buckinham, as she has just left him. 

"The Gypsy that remains, faces freedom with a little fear. I have no fear, I have only love,    And if I was a child, and that child was a child...."

The remaining Gypsy is almost certainly Nicks; her fellow Gypsy has gone, and now she is left alone, with a new-found, yet unwelcome freedom. She then says she doesn't have fear, but has love, and then talks about a "child". Fans have theorized that this child is Matthew, Robin's son, whom Nicks wanted to raise for Snyder. She feels this is her duty, and she isn't afraid to take it on. In other cases, the dancing gypsy could be Nicks leaving Buckingham.

"I still see your bright eyes."

Nicks specifically said she added this part for Snyder, but those who didn't hear the proclamation actually assume that this bit is about either Nicks or Buckingham.

==Music Video==
The video for this song, directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]], was the very first "World Premiere Video" on [[MTV]] in 1982, and was the highest-budget music video ever produced at the time. It was shot in a multitude of locations, including (but, not limited to) a highly detailed portrayal of a forest, many costumes and dancers, etc...The truest aspect of this video to the songs meaning is possibly the very beginning, featuring a room covered in bohemian-type decor. The 	camera soon settles on Nicks, sitting on the floor, and singing into the mirror. The video actually supports the belief that this song was mainly about Buckingham, as one of the scenes show Nicks and Buckingham dancing in a 1930s ballroom setting. The shot scene ends with Nicks walking out of his grasp, into the rain <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97pXkcMEds ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>
