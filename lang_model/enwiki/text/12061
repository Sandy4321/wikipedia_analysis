'''Misua''', '''mee sua''' or '''miswa''', is a very thin variety of salted [[Chinese noodle]]s made from [[Flour#Wheat flour|wheat flour]]. They differ from [[Rice vermicelli|mifen]] and [[cellophane noodles]] in that the latter two are made from [[rice]] and [[mung bean]]s, respectively and typically a lot thinner than the two.

==Preparation==
Cooking misua usually takes less than 2 minutes in boiling water, and sometimes significantly less.

==Culture==
''Misua'' are cooked during important festivities, and are eaten among the [[Chinese race|Chinese]] community in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Brunei]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]].  ''Misua'' signifies long life in [[Chinese culture]], and as such is a traditional birthday food.  It is usually served topped with  ingredients such as [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[oyster]]s, pig's large intestine, [[Shiitake|shiitake mushroom]], [[beef]], [[shallots]], or [[scallions]], and roasted [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s. In [[Taiwan]], there are two forms of misua, the first is plain while the second has been steamed at high heat, caramelizing it to a light brown colour. For birthdays, plain misua is usually served plain with pork hocks ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+732A><U+8173><U+9EB5><U+7DDA>}}) in stewed broths as a Taiwanese birthday tradition. Brown misua can be cooked for prolong periods without disintegrating in the cooking broth and is used in [[Oyster vermicelli]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+86B5><U+4ED4><U+9EB5><U+7DDA>}}).
