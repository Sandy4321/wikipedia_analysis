The '''Second Battle of Naktong Bulge''' was an engagement between [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[North Korean]] (NK) forces early in the [[Korean War]] from September 1 to September 15, 1950, along the [[Naktong River]] in [[South Korea]]. It was a part of the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]], and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of [[United States]] (US) and [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack.

== Background ==
=== Pusan Perimeter ===
{{Main|Battle of Pusan Perimeter|First Battle of Naktong Bulge}}
From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the North Korean People's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the [[Republic of Korea Army]] and the [[United Nations]] forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing.<ref name="Apple392">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=392}}</ref> The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, [[Frontal assault|attacking from the front]] and initiating a [[double envelopment]] of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment.<ref name="Var6">{{harvnb|Varhola|2004|p=6}}</ref> From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south.<ref name="Fehr138">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=138}}</ref> However, when the UN forces, under the [[Eighth United States Army]], established the [[Pusan Perimeter]] in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the [[Logistics at the Battle of Pusan Perimeter|superior UN logistical system]] brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army.<ref name="Apple393">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=393}}</ref>

When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the [[NK 6th Division]], and later the [[NK 7th Division]] engaged the [[US 25th Infantry Division]] at the [[Battle of Masan]], initially repelling a UN [[counteroffensive]] before countering with battles at [[Battle of Komam-ni|Komam-ni]]<ref name="Apple367">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=367}}</ref> and [[Battle of Battle Mountain|Battle Mountain]].<ref name="Bowers149">{{harvnb|Bowers|Hammong|MacGarrigle|2005|p=149}}</ref> These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of [[reserve (military)|reserves]], repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks.<ref name="Apple369">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=369}}</ref> North of Masan, the [[NK 4th Division]] and the [[US 24th Infantry Division]] sparred in the [[Naktong Bulge]] area. In the [[First Battle of Naktong Bulge]], the North Korean division was unable to hold its [[bridgehead]] across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=130}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=139}}</ref> In the [[Taegu]] region, five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the [[Battle of Taegu]].<ref name="Apple353">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=353}}</ref><ref name="Alex143">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=143}}</ref> Particularly heavy fighting took place at the [[Battle of the Bowling Alley]] where the [[NK 13th Division]] was almost completely destroyed in the attack.<ref name="Catch31">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=31}}</ref> On the east coast, three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at [[P'ohang-dong]] during the [[Battle of P'ohang-dong]].<ref name="Fehr136">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=136}}</ref> All along the front, the North Korean troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their strategies were not working.<ref name="Fehr135">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=135}}</ref>

=== September push ===
{{Main|The Great Naktong Offensive}}
In planning its new offensive, the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy.<ref name="Catch31">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=31}}</ref> Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle.<ref name="Apple393"/> Fed by intelligence from the [[Soviet Union]] the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle.<ref name="Fehr139">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=139}}</ref> A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.<ref name="Mill508">{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=508}}</ref><ref name="Alex181">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=181}}</ref> 

On August 20, the North Korean commands distributed [[operations order]]s to their subordinate units.<ref name="Fehr139"/> The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered.<ref name="Apple395">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=395}}</ref> The center attack called for the [[NK 9th Division]], [[NK 4th Division]], [[NK 2nd Division]], and [[NK 10th Division]] break through the [[US 2nd Infantry Division]] at the Naktong Bulge to [[Miryang]] and [[Yongsan]].<ref name="Apple396">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=396}}</ref>

== Battle ==
During the North Koreans' September 1 offensive, the [[US 25th Infantry Division]]'s [[US 35th Infantry Regiment]] was heavily engaged in the [[Battle of Nam River]] north of [[Masan]]. On the 35th Regiment's right flank, just north of the confluence of the [[Nam River (Korea)|Nam River]] and the [[Naktong River]], was the [[US 9th Infantry Regiment]], [[US 2nd Infantry Division]].<ref name="Apple443"/> There, in the southern-most part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone, the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than {{convert|20,000|yd}} long, including the bulge area of the Naktong where the [[First Battle of Naktong Bulge]] had taken place earlier in August.<ref name="Fehr141">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=141}}</ref> Each US [[infantry]] [[company (military)|company]] on the river line here had a front of {{convert|3,000|ft}} to {{convert|4,000|ft}} and they held only key hills and observation points, as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front.<ref name="Apple443">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=443}}</ref>

During the last week of August, US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river, which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the Naktong against a possible American attack.<ref name="Alex182">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=182}}</ref>  There were occasional attacks 9th Infantry forward positions, but to the men in the front line this appeared to be only normal patrol action.<ref name="Apple443"/> On August 31, the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines. Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming.<ref name="Fehr140">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=140}}</ref>

On the west side of the Naktong, North Korean [[Major General]] Pak Kyo Sam, commanding the NK 9th Division, issued his [[operations order]] to the division on August 28. Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bulge by capturing the [[Miryang]] and [[Samnangjin]] areas to cut off the US 2nd Division's route of supply and withdrawal between [[Taegu]] and Pusan.<ref name="Fehr139"/> However, the North Koreans weren't aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the [[US 24th Infantry Division]] in positions along the Naktong River. Consequently they expected lighter resistance; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea.<ref name="Apple443"/> They had only recently been moved into the line.<ref name="Alex182"/><ref name="Fehr139"/> The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points.<ref name="Fehr140"/>

=== Battle of Agok ===
On the southern-most flank of the 9th Infantry river line, just above the junction of the Nam River with the Naktong, A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge paralleling the Naktong that terminates in Hill 94 at the [[Kihang]] ferry site.<ref name="Apple444"/> The river road from [[Namji-ri]] running west along the Naktong passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry.<ref name="Fehr142">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=142}}</ref> A small village called [[Agok]] lay at the base of Hill 94 and {{convert|300|yd}} from the river.<ref name="Apple444"/> A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles, together with two infantry [[squad]]s of A Company, 9th Infantry, held a roadblock near the ferry and close to Agok.<ref name="Fehr142"/> On the evening of August 31, A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking Agok and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line.<ref name="Apple444">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=444}}</ref>

[[File:M19 GMC.JPG|thumb|alt=An armored vehicle with several machine guns|An [[M19 Gun Motor Carriage]] in Korea, 1950.]]

That evening [[Sergeant]] [[Ernest R. Kouma]] led the patrol of two [[M26 Pershing]] tanks and two [[M19 Gun Motor Carriage]]s in Agok.<ref name="Fehr142"/> Kouma placed his patrol on the west side of Agok near the Kihang ferry. At 20:00 a heavy fog covered the river, and at 22:00 mortar shells began falling on the American-held side of the river.<ref name="Alex183">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=183}}</ref> By 22:15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company's positions. American mortars and artillery began firing counterbattery.<ref name="Fehr140"/> Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water.<ref name="Apple444"/>

At 22:30 the fog lifted and Kouma saw that a North Korean [[pontoon bridge]] was being laid across the river directly in front of his position.<ref name="Apple444"/> Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks.<ref name="Fehr142"/> This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.<ref name="Apple444"/> 

Kouma's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms.<ref name="Apple445"/> Kouma was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw, but he held the Agok site until 07:30 the next morning with his single tank.<ref name="Fehr142"/> In the attack against A Company, the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon, which was near Agok, but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward.<ref name="Apple445">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=445}}</ref>

The NK 9th Division's infantry crossing of the Naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company, north of A Company.<ref name="Alex183"/> There the North Koreans assaulted in force, signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles. The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape.<ref name="Fehr141"/> Many of the men moved south, a few of them coming into A Company's ridge line positions near Agok during the night. Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the Naktong. On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines.<ref name="Apple445"/>

=== North Korean crossing ===
Meanwhile, {{convert|5|mi}} north of Agok and A Company's position, B Company, 9th Infantry, held a similar position on Hill 209 overlooking the [[Paekchin]] ferry crossing of the river.<ref name="Alex183"/>  This ferry was located at the middle of the Naktong Bulge where the [[Yongsan]] road came down to the Naktong and crossed it.<ref name="Fehr143">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=143}}</ref> The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31, the same night that the [[NK I Corps]] offensive rolled across the river.<ref name="Apple446">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=446}}</ref>

Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of the Naktong and observed North Korean tank and troop activity {{convert|2|mi}} west of the river.<ref name="Alex183"/> Information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the NK 9th Division.<ref name="Fehr143"/> On August 25, 9th Infantry commander [[US Colonel|Colonel]] John G. Hill outlined projected "Operation Manchu," which was to be a company-sized combat patrol to cross the river, advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communications center, destroy it, capture prisoners, and collect intelligence.<ref name="Apple446"/>

[[File:Walton Walker.gif|left|thumb|alt=A stout man in a military uniform|US Lieutenant General Walton Walker]]

The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Force Manchu on orders from the 2nd Division commander [[US Major General|Major General]] Lawrence B. Keiser, which in turn had received instructions from [[Eighth United States Army]] commander [[US Lieutenant General|Lieutenant General]] [[Walton Walker]] for aggressive patrolling.<ref name="Apple446"/> Keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the Paekchin ferry. The 9th Infantry reserve, E Company, reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company, was to be the attack force.<ref name="Fehr143"/> The 1st Platoon, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, was to transport it across the river in [[assault boat]]s the night of August 31. Two heavy weapons companies, D and H, were each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns, one section of 81-mm. mortars, and one section of [[75-mm. recoilless rifle]]s for supporting fires. A [[platoon]] of 4.2-inch mortars was also to give support.<ref name="Apple446"/>

After dark on August 31, [[US First Lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] Charles I. Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward Schmitt of H Company, 9th Infantry, moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill 209, which was within B Company's defense sector and overlooked the Paekchin ferry crossing of the Naktong River.<ref name="Apple446"/> The raiding force, E Company, was still in its regimental reserve position about {{convert|2|mi}} west of [[Yongsan]], getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site.<ref name="Fehr143"/> Hill went forward in the evening with the 4.2-inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill 209 where the mortarmen prepared to set up their weapons.<ref name="Apple447">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=447}}</ref>

By 21:00, the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill 209, {{convert|1|mi}} north of the river road which curved around the hill's southern base.<ref name="Fehr143"/> The regimental [[chaplain]], [[US Captain|Captain]] Lewis B. Sheen, had gone forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services. On top of Hill 209, Chaplain Sheen and men in B Company after dark heard splashing in the water below them. They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers wading the river.<ref name="Apple447"/>

The first North Korean crossing at the Paekchin ferry caught the Heavy Mortar Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons.<ref name="Fehr143"/> It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill 209, {{convert|.5|mi}} from the crossing site. The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there.<ref name="Apple447"/> Hill was there, but escaped to the rear just before midnight, together with several others, when the division canceled Operation Manchu because of the attacks.<ref name="Fehr143"/> The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack engulfed the men below. It hurried on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter. This group was not attacked during the night.<ref name="Apple447"/>

From  21:30 until shortly after midnight the NK 9th Division crossed the Naktong at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions.<ref name="Apple447"/> Then, when the artillery barrage preparation lifted, the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults. These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward.<ref name="Fehr143"/> At each crossing site the North Koreans would overwhelm local UN defenders before building pontoon bridges for their vehicles and armor.<ref name="Apple447"/>

At 02:00, B Company was attacked.<ref name="Alex183"/> A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill, a whistle sounded, then came a shouted order, and North Korean soldiers started climbing the slope.<ref name="Apple448"/> The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311, a rugged terrain feature a {{convert|1.5|mi}} from the river and the North Koreans' principal immediate objective.<ref name="Fehr143"/> The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force Manchu group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night. But higher up on Hill 209 the North Koreans drove B Company from its position, inflicting very heavy casualties on it. Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September.<ref name="Apple448">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=448}}</ref>

At 03:00, 1 September, the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve, E Company to move west along the Yongsan-Naktong River road and take a blocking position at the pass between Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, {{convert|3|mi}} from the river and {{convert|6|mi}} from Yongsan.<ref name="Apple448"/> This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the Naktong Bulge.<ref name="Fehr143"/> Fighting began at the pass at 02:30 when an American medium tank of A Company, 72nd Tank Battalion, knocked out a [[T-34]] at [[Tugok]], also called Morisil. E Company never reached its blocking position.<ref name="Apple448"/> A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03:30 from positions astride the road east of the pass. The company suffered heavy casualties, including the [[company commander]] and Keiser's aide who had accompanied the force.<ref name="Fehr143"/> With the critical parts of Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, the best defensive terrain between Yongsan and the river, the North Koreans controlled the high ground. The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of Yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain, the low hills at the western edge of the town.<ref name="Apple448"/>

=== US 23rd Infantry attacked ===
North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the Naktong, the [[US 23rd Infantry Regiment]] on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the [[US 38th Infantry Regiment]], which in turn had only a few days before relieved the [[US 21st Infantry Regiment]] of the US 24th Infantry Division.<ref name="Alex183"/> On August 1, the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge.<ref name="Fehr144"/> It took over a {{convert|16,000|yd}} Naktong River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the [[US 1st Cavalry Division]] to the north. Colonel Paul L. Freeman, the regimental commander, deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast.<ref name="Apple448"/> The 1st Battalion, under [[US Lieutenant Colonel]] Claire E. Hutchin, Jr., outposted the hills with platoons and squads. He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position {{convert|8|mi}} behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector.<ref name="Fehr145">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=143}}</ref> On August 31h the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector.<ref name="Apple449">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=449}}</ref>

Two roads ran through the regimental sector from the Naktong River to [[Changnyong]].<ref name="Alex183"/> The main road bent south along the east bank of the river to [[Pugong-ni]] and then turned northeast to Changnyong. A northern secondary road curved around marshland and lakes, the largest of which was [[Lake U-p'o]], to Changnyong. In effect, the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to Changnyong.<ref name="Apple449"/>

The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon, B Company, 23rd Infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a {{convert|2,600|yd}} front along the east bank of the Naktong north of Pugong-ni.<ref name="Apple449"/> Across the river in the rice paddies they could see, in the afternoon of August 31, two large groups of North Korean soldiers. Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them.<ref name="Fehr145"/> Just before dark, the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river. They immediately reported to the battalion command post. The artillery forward observer, who estimated the column at 2,000 people, thought they were refugees. Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column, reducing its number. However the North Koreans continued their advance.<ref name="Apple449"/>

At 21:00 the first shells of what proved to be a two-hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon.<ref name="Alex183"/> As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire.<ref name="Fehr145"/> At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.<ref name="Apple449"/>

On the regimental left along the main Pugong-ni-Changnyong road North Korean soldiers completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1.<ref name="Alex183"/> Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for, and three days later, after all the stragglers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in, there were only 20 men in the company.<ref name="Fehr145"/> As the North Korean attack developed during the night, 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force, less C Company, just north of Lake U-p'o and the hills there covering the northern road into Changnyong, {{convert|3|mi}} east of the river and {{convert|5|mi}} west of the town. B Company lost heavily in this action.<ref name="Apple450">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=450}}</ref>

When word of the disaster that had overtaken 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters, Freeman obtained the release of G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward Pugong-ni and C Company. [[US Major|Major]] Lloyd K. Jensen, [[executive officer]] of the 2nd Battalion, accompanied F Company down the Pugong-ni road.<ref name="Apple450"/> This force was unable to reach C Company, but Jensen collected stragglers from it and seized high ground astride this main approach to Changnyong near Ponch'o-ri above [[Lake Sanorho]], and went into a defensive position there.<ref name="Fehr145"/> The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the 23d Regiment in front of Changnyong.<ref name="Apple450"/> North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions.<ref name="Fehr145"/> The 23rd Infantry [[Headquarters and Service Companies]] and other miscellaneous regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post {{convert|5|mi}} northwest of Changnyong.<ref name="Apple450"/>

=== US 2nd Division split ===
Before the morning of 1 September had passed, reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the north-south Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the division in two;<ref name="Fehr145"/> the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south.<ref name="Alex183"/> Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces.<ref name="Fehr146">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=146}}</ref> Accordingly, he placed the [[division artillery]] commander, [[US Brigadier General|Brigadier General]] Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Haynes' command post was {{Convert|7|mi}} north of Changnyong. Task Force Haynes became operational at 10:20, September 1. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, [[Assistant Division Commander]], in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, most of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and other miscellaneous units of the division. This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley.<ref name="Apple450"/>

All three [[regiment]]s of the [[NK 2nd Division]]-the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in line from north to south-crossed during the night to the east side of the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, concentrated in the [[Sinban-ni]] area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow.<ref name="Apple451">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=451}}</ref>

At dawn September 1, Keiser at 2nd Division headquarters in [[Muan-ni]], {{convert|7|mi}} east of Yongsan on the [[Miryang]] road, felt his division was in the midst of a crisis.<ref name="Apple451"/> The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry.<ref name="Fehr146"/> The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the [[NK 10th Division]] had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near [[Hyongp'ung]] in the US 38th Infantry sector. At 08:10 Keiser telephoned Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest North Korean penetrations were in the 9th Infantry sector.<ref name="Apple451"/>

Liaison planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division front-line units.<ref name="Apple452"/> Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken.<ref name="Fehr146"/> Beginning at 09:30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day, the light aviation section of the division artillery located front-line units cut off by the North Koreans, and made fourteen [[airdrop]]s of ammunition, food, water, and medical supplies.<ref name="Apple452"/> As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole {{convert|6|mi}} wide and {{convert|8|mi}} deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penetrations elsewhere.<ref name="Alex183"/> The front-line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of disorganization and some companies had virtually disappeared.<ref name="Fehr146"/> Keiser hoped he could organize a defense along the Changnyong-Yongsan road east of the Naktong River, and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to Miryang and [[Ch'ongdo]].<ref name="Apple452">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=452}}</ref>

=== Reinforcements ===
[[File:POW Naktong Bulge.jpg|thumb|alt=A man sits on a jeep with his hands on his head|A North Korean POW captured by US Marines along Naktong Bulge, September 4.]]
At 09:00 Walker requested the [[US Air Force]] to make a maximum effort along the Naktong River from [[Toksong-dong]], just above the US 2nd Division boundary, southward and to a depth of {{convert|15|mi}} west of the river.<ref name="Fehr146"/> He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spearhead units.<ref name="Apple452"/> The Far East Command requested the [[US Navy]] to join in the air effort, and the [[US Seventh Fleet]] turned back from its strikes in the [[Inch'on]]-[[Seoul]] area and sped southward at full steam toward the southern battle front.<ref name="Fehr146"/> Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12:00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs. He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the Yongsan area.<ref name="Apple452"/>

During the morning of 1 September, Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front, wavering in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves.<ref name="Apple452"/> Since midnight the NK I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places-the NK 2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector, and the [[NK 7th Division]] and [[NK 6th Division]] in the US 25th Division sector, below the junction of the Nam and Naktong Rivers.<ref name="Fehr146"/> In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of Yongsan, the gateway to the corridor leading {{convert|12|mi}} eastward to Miryang and the main Pusan-[[Mukden]] railroad and highway.<ref name="Apple452"/>

Eighth Army had in reserve three understrength infantry regiments and the 2-battalion [[British 27th Infantry Brigade]] which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line: The [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] at [[Changwon]], {{convert|6|mi}} northeast of Masan, preparing for movement to the port of Pusan; the [[US 27th Infantry Regiment]] of the 25th Division which had arrived at Masan only the night before at 20:30 to relieve the [[5th Regimental Combat Team]], which was then to join the 24th Division in the Taegu area; and the [[US 19th Infantry Regiment]] of the US 24th Infantry Division, then with that division's headquarters at [[Kyongsan]] southeast of Taegu.<ref name="Alex184">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=184}}</ref>  Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters, together with its 19th Regiment, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment's notice;<ref name="Fehr147">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=147}}</ref> the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts, and the marines to an unannounced destination.<ref name="Apple453">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=453}}</ref>

As the morning passed, General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Division sector.<ref name="Alex184"/> There the North Koreans threatened Miryang and with it the entire Eighth Army position. At 11:00 Walker ordered [[US Marine Corps]] Brigadier General Edward Craig, commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, to prepare the marines to move at once.<ref name="Fehr147"/> The marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bulge at 13:30.<ref name="Apple453"/>

=== North Korean advance ===

The situation on the front was chaotic during the day September 1. The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the Kihang ferry, captured Agok, and scattered A Company, 9th Infantry at its positions from Agok northward. A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river. From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them, most of them moving east. After several hours, 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to Agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night, returning later with much needed water, rations, and ammunition.<ref name="Apple454">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=454}}</ref>

Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. [[Proximity fuze]] artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force.<ref name="Apple454"/> In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.<ref name="Apple455">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=455}}</ref>

During the withdraw, however, A Company ran into a sizable North Korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, [[Private First Class]] [[Luther H. Story]], a weapons [[squad leader]], fought so tenaciously that he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines.<ref name="Apple455"/> The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the [[Battle of Yongsan]] which was then in progress.<ref name="Fehr152">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=152}}</ref> That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan.<ref name="Apple455"/> Stragglers from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well.<ref name="Apple456">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=456}}</ref>

=== The end of Task Force Manchu ===
In the meantime, Task Force Manchu was still holding its position along the Naktong River, about {{convert|5|mi}} north of where A Company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line.<ref name="Apple456"/> The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies, 9th Infantry, who had started up the hill before the North Koreans struck, was on a southern knob of Hill 209, {{convert|0.5|mi}} south of B Company's higher position.<ref name="Fehr144">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=144}}</ref> In addition to the D and H Company men, there were a few from the Heavy Mortar Platoon and one or two from B Company. Altogether, 60 to 70 men were in the group. The group had an [[SCR-300]] radio, a heavy machine gun, two light machine gun, a [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]], about 20 [[M1 Garand]] rifles, and about 40 carbines or pistols. Schmitt assumed command of the group.<ref name="Apple456"/>

During the night Schmitt established radio communication with the 1st Battalion, 9th infantry.<ref name="Apple456"/> When daylight came Schmitt and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans. One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward.<ref name="Fehr144"/> The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed.<ref name="Apple456"/> That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing the fight to close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter.<ref name="Fehr144"/> Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter.<ref name="Apple456"/>

In the afternoon of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies.<ref name="Fehr144"/> A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class [[Joseph R. Ouellette]], of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in [[hand-to-hand combat]].<ref name="Apple457">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=457}}</ref>

That same afternoon, the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill to Schmitt with the message, "You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces."<ref name="Fehr144"/> Failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force, the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire.<ref name="Apple457"/> Only 45 minutes later North Korean antitank fire came in on the knob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill 209 swept the perimeter. Soon, mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Schmitt's perimeter and continued firing until dark.<ref name="Apple458"/> The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his [[foxhole]]. The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks, all of which were repulsed.<ref name="Fehr144"/> But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing, and supplies were diminishing. There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man.<ref name="Apple458">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=458}}</ref>

The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.<ref name="Fehr150">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=150}}</ref> Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks  repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole.<ref name="Apple458"/> Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came.<ref name="Fehr144"/> Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it. Six times Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it. In this close action Ouellette was killed. Most of the foxholes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire.<ref name="Fehr150"/> One of these killed Schmitt on September 3. The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J. McDoniel of D Company, senior surviving officer.<ref name="Apple458"/>

At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two [[officer (military)|officers]] and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive.<ref name="Fehr150"/> As the day passed, with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night.<ref name="Apple458"/> When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines.<ref name="Fehr150"/> That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position.<ref name="Apple458"/> At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 [[enlisted men]] slipped off the hill in groups of four. [[Master Sergeant]] [[Travis E. Watkins]], still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away.<ref name="Fehr144"/> He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.<ref name="Apple459">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=459}}</ref><ref name="Fehr153">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=153}}</ref>

Members of Task Force Manchu who escaped from Hill 209 brought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of the [[Paekchin]] ferry crossing site. At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an [[underwater bridge]]. A short distance downstream, each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.<ref name="Apple459"/>

=== Changyong ===
[[File:Defensive Position in Front of Changnyong.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial view of a town with several areas highlighted|Changyong defensive positions, 1950.]]
North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the Naktong Bulge and around Yongsan, the US 23d Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position.<ref name="Alex184"/> Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated {{convert|3|mi}} westward. Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post, compelling Freeman to withdraw it about {{convert|600|yd}}.<ref name="Fehr155"/> There, {{convert|5|mi}} northwest of Changnyong, the US 23rd Infantry [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]], miscellaneous regimental units, and regimental [[staff officer]]s checked the North Koreans in a 3-hour fight.<ref name="Apple466">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=466}}</ref>

The North Koreans advanced to Changnyong itself during the afternoon of September 2, and [[ROK National Police]] withdrew from the town.<ref name="Fehr155"/> North Koreans were in Changnyong that evening. With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry, Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the Yongsan road in an effort to re-establish communication. C Company, 72nd Tank Battalion, led its tanks southward. They had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks. Of the three tanks that started, only the lead tank got through to Yongsan. There, it delivered an overlay of Task Force Haynes' positions to Bradley.<ref name="Apple466"/>

Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active. After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31, Keiser had ordered the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry, to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of Changnyong.<ref name="Fehr155"/> In attempting to do this, the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road. They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry command post. This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment. At 06:00 September 3, 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other. But the Air Force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes.<ref name="Apple467">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=467}}</ref>

This fight continued until September 5. On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 North Koreans.<ref name="Fehr155">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=155}}</ref>> From the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them. Directed artillery fire destroyed the village. Among the abandoned North Korean materiel on the hill, Schauer's men found twenty-five American BARs and submachine guns, a large American radio, thirty boxes of unopened American fragmentation and concussion grenades, and some American rations.<ref name="Apple467"/>

=== 1-23rd Infantry isolated ===
Meanwhile, during these actions in its rear, the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry, was cut off {{convert|3|mi}} west of the nearest friendly units<ref name="Fehr154">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=154}}</ref>. On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the Changnyong area. At 14:00 a tank-infantry patrol was sent down the road, but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion's defense perimeter. Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies. That evening Freeman approved this request, and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions. During this time [[C-47 Skytrain]] planes supplied the battalion by airdrops.<ref name="Apple467"/>

On the morning of September 1, 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near [[Mosan-ni]] to open the road to the 1st Battalion. On the second day of the fighting at the pass, the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire. The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17:00 September 2. That evening, North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion, driving one company from its position.<ref name="Apple468">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=468}}</ref>

On September 4, Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments, giving the northern part of the 23rd's sector to the 38th Infantry, thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to Changnyong.<ref name="Apple468"/> The 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry, about 1,100 men strong when the attack began, was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men. The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the Pugong-ni-Changnyong road.<ref name="Fehr155"/> The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion. At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position. In this regimental perimeter, the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles. Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating North Koreans from Changnyong and from its supply road.<ref name="Apple468"/>

=== NK 2nd Division destroyed ===
The NK 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry's perimeter in the predawn hours of September 8, in an attempt to break through eastward. This attack, launched at 02:30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. It was apparent that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, [[adjutant]] of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company.<ref name="Apple468"/> With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company's position and gaining its rear, Robinson in the darkness made his way through them {{convert|500|yd}} to A Company's position. There he obtained that company's reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company. He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of maneuvering it into the gap in F Company's lines in darkness and heavy rain.<ref name="Apple468"/>

The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight, but that night it resumed. The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September.<ref name="Apple468"/> The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops.<ref name="Fehr155"/> Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent.<ref name="Apple469">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=469}}</ref>

This heavy night and day battle cost the NK 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength.<ref name="Fehr155"/> The medical officer of the NK 17th Regiment, 2nd Division, captured a few days later, said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in Pugong-ni, and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1,300 killed and 2,500 wounded in the fighting west of Changnyong. Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9, the division continued to harass rear areas around Changnyong with infiltrating groups as large as companies. Patrols daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town.<ref name="Apple469"/>

North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along the Naktong River for several more days. The North Koreans' offensive capability was largely destroyed, and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack.<ref name="Apple469"/>

=== North Korean withdrawal ===
{{see also|Battle of Inchon}}

The UN [[Battle of Inchon|counterattack at Inchon]] collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes.<ref name="Apple568">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=568}}</ref><ref name="Fehr159">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=159}}</ref> On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.<ref name="Bowers179">{{harvnb|Bowers|Hammong|MacGarrigle|2005|p=179}}</ref><ref name="Alex187">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=187}}</ref> Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea.<ref name="Apple570">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=570}}</ref> The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18<U+2013>19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.<ref name="Apple570"/> The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.<ref name="Bowers180">{{harvnb|Bowers|Hammong|MacGarrigle|2005|p=180}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. The 2nd Division numbered 6,000.<ref name="Apple395">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=395}}</ref> Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight. The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed, captured or deserted.<ref name="Apple603">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=603}}</ref> All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and the North Korean army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.<ref name="Apple604">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=604}}</ref>

By this time, the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Ecker16">{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=16}}</ref> This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month.<ref>{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=20}}</ref> American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Ecker14">{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=14}}</ref> The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties.<ref name="Apple382">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=382}}</ref>
