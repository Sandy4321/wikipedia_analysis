'''George Churchill Kenney''' (6 August 1889 <U+2013> 9 August 1977) was a [[United States Army Air Forces]] general during [[World War II]]. He is best known as the commander of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Air Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) from August 1942  until 1945.

Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] in 1917, and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with the [[91st Aero Squadron]]. He was awarded a [[Citation Star|Silver Star]] and the [[Distinguished Service Cross]] for incidents in which he fought off German fighters and shot two down. After hostilities ended he participated in the [[Occupation of the Rhineland]]. After returning to the United States, he flew reconnaissance missions along the border between the United States and Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Commissioned into the [[Regular Army]] in 1920, he attended the  [[Air Corps Tactical School]], and later became an instructor there.  He was responsible for the acceptance of [[Martin NBS-1]] bombers built by [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtis]], and test flew them. He also developed techniques for mounting [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.30 caliber machine guns]] on the wings of an [[Airco DH.4]] aircraft.

In early 1940, he became Assistant [[Military Attach<U+00E9>]] for Air in France.  As a result of his observations of German and Allied air operations during the early stages of World War II, he recommended many important changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics. In July 1942, he assumed command of the Allied Air Forces and [[Fifth Air Force]] in [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s Southwest Pacific Area. Under Kenney's command, the Allied Air Forces developed innovative command structures, weapons, and tactics that reflected Kenney's orientation towards attack aviation. The new weapons and tactics won perhaps his greatest victory, in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] in March 1943. In June 1944 he was appointed commander of the Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, [[Thirteenth Air Force|Thirteenth]], and [[Seventh Air Force]]s.

In April 1946 he became the first commander of the newly formed [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), but his performance in the role was criticized, and he was shifted to become commander of the [[Air University (United States)|Air University]], a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951.

==Early life==
During a summer vacation taken by his parents to avoid the humidity of the Boston area, George Churchill Kenney was born in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], on 6 August 1889, the oldest of four children of carpenter Joseph Atwood Kenney and his wife Anne Louise Kenney, n<U+00E9>e Churchill. He grew up in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], where he graduated from [[Brookline High School]] in 1907. Later that year he entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he pursued a course in civil engineering. He quit MIT after his father left, and took a number of jobs before becoming a [[surveyor]] for the Quebec Saguenay Railroad.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=1-5}}<ref name=WhiteBio>The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography 1946, p. 51</ref>

After his mother's death in 1913, he returned to Boston, where he took a job with [[Stone & Webster]]. In 1914 he joined the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] as a civil engineer, building a bridge in [[New London, Connecticut]]. After this was completed, he formed a partnership with a high school classmate, Gordon Glazier, called the Beaver Contracting and Engineering Corporation. The firm became involved in a number of projects, including building a seawall at [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], and a bridge over the [[Squannacook River]].{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=5-6}}

==World War I==
After the United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] on 2 June 1917. He attended ground school at MIT in June and July, and received primary flight training at [[Hazelhurst Field]] in [[Mineola, New York]], from noted aviator [[Bert Acosta]]. He was commissioned as a [[first lieutenant]] on 5 November 1917, and departed for France soon after. There, he received further flight training at [[Issoudun]]. This ended in February 1918, when he was assigned to the [[91st Aero Squadron]].{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}}{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=7-10}}

The 91st Aero Squadron flew the [[Salmson 2A2]], a reconnaissance biplane. Kenney crashed one on takeoff on 22 March 1918. He broke an ankle and a hand, and earned himself the nickname "Bust 'em up George".{{sfn|Ruckman|1920|p=201}}{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=11-13}} His injuries soon healed, and he recorded his first mission on 3 June. Kenney flew one of four aircraft on a mission near [[Gorze]] on 15 September 1918 that was attacked by six German [[Pfalz D.III]] scouts. His observer shot one of them down, and Kenney was credited with his first aerial victory. For this he was awarded a [[Citation Star|Silver Star]]. A second victory followed in similar circumstances on 9 October while he was flying near [[Jametz]] in support of the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. Once again, the formation he was flying with was attacked by German fighters. This time he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross]], which was presented by [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Billy Mitchell]] on 10 January 1919.

{{quote|For extraordinary heroism in action near Jametz, France, October <!-- mdy in original -->9, 1918. This officer gave proof of his bravery and devotion to duty when he was attacked by a superior number of aircraft. He accepted combat, destroyed one plane and drove the others off. Notwithstanding that the enemy returned and attacked again in strong numbers, he continued his mission and enabled his observer to secure information of great military value.{{sfn|Ruckman|1920|p=134}} }}

Kenney remained for a time with the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|Allied occupation forces in Germany]], and was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] on 18 March 1919.{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}} He returned to the United States in June 1919. He was sent to [[Kelly Field Annex|Kelly Field]], near [[San Antonio, Texas]], and then to [[McAllen, Texas]]. As commander of the [[8th Aero Squadron]], he flew reconnaissance missions along the border with Mexico at a time when the situation was very disturbed as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Poor aircraft maintenance, rough landing strips and bad weather lead to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 [[Airco DH.4]] aircraft in just one year.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=18-19}}

==Between the wars==
Kenney applied for one of a number of [[Regular Army]] commissions offered to reservists after the war,{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=18-19}}  and was commissioned as a captain in the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] on 1 July 1920.{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}} While he was in hospital in Texas recovering from an aviation accident, he met a nurse,{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=20-21}} Helen "Hazel" Dell Richardson, the daughter of a [[Mobile, Alabama]], contractor, George W. Richardson. They were married in Mobile on 6 October 1920.<ref name=WhiteBio/> Hazel miscarried twins, and was warned by her doctor of the danger of another pregnancy, but she strongly wished to have a child. In 1922, while the couple was living on [[Long Island]], New York, a son was born to them, William Richardson Kenney, but Hazel died soon afterward from complications. Kenney arranged to have the infant cared for by his neighbor, Alice Steward Maxey, another nurse. On 5 June 1923 Kenney married Maxey in her home town of [[Gardiner, Maine]].{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=20-21}}

[[Image:Airco DH-4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|DH.4 above the clouds in France. Kenney flew this aircraft in Texas, and later developed techniques for mounting machine guns on the wings.]]
From July to November 1920, Kenney was air detachment commander [[Camp Knox]], Kentucky. He then became a student at the Air Service Engineering School at [[McCook Field]], near [[Dayton Ohio]].{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|p=11}} He was the Air Service Inspector at the [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]] in [[Garden City, New York]], where he was responsible for the acceptance of the fifty [[Martin NBS-1]] bombers that the Air Service had ordered from Curtis from 1921 to 1923. Kenney inspected the aircraft, and test flew them.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=20-21}} While there, he was reduced in rank from captain to first lieutenant on 18 November 1922,{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}} a common occurrence in the aftermath of World War I when the wartime army was demobilized.{{sfn|Byrd|1997|p=45}} He returned to McCook in 1923, and developed techniques for mounting [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.30 caliber machine guns]] on the wings of a DH.4 aircraft.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|p=11}}{{sfn|Wolk|1988|p=90}} He was promoted to captain again on 3 November 1923.{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}} His daughter, Julia Churchill Kenney, was born in Dayton in June 1926.<ref name=WhiteBio/>{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=22-24}}

In 1926, Kenney became a student at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]], at [[Langley Field]], Virginia, the Air Corps' advanced training school. This was followed by attending the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, and therefore a waste of time, but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=22-24}} Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was particularly interested in low-level attacks as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=27-28}} His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|p=21}}

Kenney reached the pinnacle of his professional education in September 1932, when he entered the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. At the war college, committees of students studied a number of World War I battles; Kenney's committee examined the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]]. They updated actual war plans; Kenney's study group worked on [[War Plan Orange]]. They also had to write an individual paper; Kenney wrote his on "The Proper Composition of the Air Force". One benefit of the Army War College was that it brought Air Corps officers into contact with ground officers that they would later have to work closely with. Members of Kenney's class included [[Richard Sutherland]] and [[Stephen Jones Chamberlin|Stephen Chamberlain]], both of whom worked with Kenney on committees.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=29-32}}

[[File:Boeing B-17Es 1941-42.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers]]
Graduation from the Army War College was normally followed by a staff posting, and on graduation in June 1933 Kenney became an assistant to [[Major]] [[James E. Chaney]] in the Plans Division of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Benjamin Foulois]]. He performed a number of duties, including translating an article by the Italian airpower theorist [[Giulio Douhet]] into English. In 1934, he was involved with drafting legislation which granted the Air Corps a greater degree of independence. This legislation prompted the Army to create [[GHQ Air Force]], a centralized, air force-level command headed by an aviator answering directly to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]]. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Frank M. Andrews]] was chosen to command it, and he selected Kenney as his Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Training.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=33-36}}

In this role, Kenney was promoted to the temporary rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] on 2 March 1935, skipping that of major. He became involved in an acrimonious debate with the Army General Staff over  Air Corps' desire to purchase more [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers. He also became caught up in a bureaucratic battle between Andrews and Major General [[Oscar Westover]] over whether the Chief of the Air Corps should control GHQ Air Force. As a result, Kenney was transferred to the [[Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning, Georgia]], on 16 June 1936, with the temporary rank of major, to teach tactics to young infantry officers. He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 October 1937. The assignment was hardly a choice one for an Air Corps officer, and he accepted command of the [[432d Bombardment Squadron|89th Observation Squadron]] at [[Mitchell Field, New York]].{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}}{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=37-39}}

==World War II==
In 1939, Kenney was made Chief of the Production  Engineering Section at [[Wright Field]], Ohio. He was sent to France in early 1940, once again with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel, as Assistant [[Military Attach<U+00E9>]] for Air.{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}}  His mission was to observe [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air operations during the early stages of World War II. As a result of his observations, he recommended many important changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics, including upgrading armament from .30 caliber to [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s, and installing leak proof fuel tanks,{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|p=25}} but his scathing comparisons of the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' with the Air Corps upset many officers.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)]] |title=World Battlefronts: For the Honor of God |page=28 |date=18 January 1943 |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,802599-1,00.html |accessdate=6 July 2012 }}</ref> This resulted in his being sent back to Wright Field.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|p=26}} In January 1941, he became commander of the Air Corps Experimental Depot and Engineering School there, with the rank of brigadier general. He was promoted to major general on 26 March 1942, when he became commander of the [[Fourth Air Force]],{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}} an air defense and training organization based in [[San Francisco]].{{sfn|Griffith|1998|p=42}} Kenney personally instructed pilots on how to handle the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] and [[A-29 Hudson]].{{sfn|Wolk|1988|pp=91-92}}

In July 1942, Kenney received orders to take over the Allied Air Forces and [[Fifth Air Force]] in [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]]. MacArthur had been dissatisfied with the performance of his air commander, Lieutenant General [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]]. Andrews turned down the job, and, offered a choice between Kenney and Major General [[James Doolittle]], MacArthur chose Kenney.{{sfn|Wolk|1987|p=165}} Kenney reported to General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in [[Brisbane]] on 28 July 1942, and was treated to "a lecture for approximately an hour on the shortcomings of the Air Force in general, and the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific in particular."{{sfn|Wolk|1988|p=93}} Kenney felt that MacArthur did not understand air operations, but recognized that he somehow needed to establish a good working relationship with him. When he asked MacArthur for authority to send people he considered "deadwood" home, something that his superiors in Washington, D.C., had refused to give, MacArthur enthusiastically approved.{{sfn|Wolk|1987|pp=168-169}}{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=44}}

Building a good relationship with MacArthur meant getting past Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff. Brett advised Kenney that "a showdown early in the game with Sutherland might clarify the entire atmosphere."{{sfn|Wolk|1987|pp=168-169}} Sutherland, who had a civil pilot's licence, had taken to issuing detailed instructions to the Army Forces. This was more than just a turf battle; to many airmen, it was a part of the ongoing battle for an independent air force that they had long been agitating for.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|pp=66-68}} At one point, Kenney drew a dot on a plain page of paper and said: "the dot represents what you know about air operations, the entire rest of the paper what I know."{{sfn|Wolk|2002|p=69}} Sutherland backed down. He would let Kenney run the Allied Air Forces without interference.{{sfn|Wolk|1987|pp=168-169}} It did not follow, however, that MacArthur would invariably accept Kenney's advice.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|p=70}}

[[File:Kenney and staff.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kenney (center) surrounded by his staff.]]
Kenney sent home Major General [[Ralph Royce]], Brigadier Generals Edwin S. Perrin, Albert Sneed and Martin Scanlon,{{sfn|Wolk|1988|p=92}} and about forty colonels.{{sfn|Wolk|1987|pp=168-169}} In Australia he found two talented, recently-arrived brigadier generals, [[Ennis Whitehead]] and [[Kenneth Walker]].{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=11}} Kenney reorganized his command in August, appointed Whitehead as commander of the V Fighter Command and Walker as commander of the V Bomber Command.{{sfn|Barr|1997|p=20}} The Allied Air Forces was composed of both [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) personnel. Kenney moved to separate them. Brigadier General [[Donald Wilson (general)|Donald Wilson]] arrived in September and replaced [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[William Bostock]] as Kenney's chief of staff. Bostock took over the newly created [[RAAF Command]].{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=100}}

This brought Kenney into conflict with the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify the administration of the RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|p=63}} However, Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where fast-changing weather and enemy action could invalidate orders drawn up in Australia.{{sfn|Rodman|2005|p=77}} Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}}

Perhaps because of his experience in World War I, Kenney had a great deal of respect for Japanese fighters.{{sfn|Barr|1997|pp=15-16}} He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=42<U+2013>45}} SWPA had a low priority, and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions.{{sfn|Barr|1997|p=23}} What he needed was an effective long range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would change this, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems.{{sfn|Watson|1944|pp=76-78}} Kenney had [[Charles Lindbergh]] teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=412-414}}

[[File:A20BismarckSea.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[United States Army Air Forces|U.S.]] [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]] of the 89th Squadron, 3rd Attack Group, at the moment it clears a Japanese merchant ship following a successful skip bombing attack. Wewak, New Guinea, March 1944]]
The Southwest Pacific was not a promising theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day did not have the range to reach Japan from Australia,{{sfn|Rodman|2005|p=14}} and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries.{{sfn|Rodman|2005|p=24}} This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two [[orders of magnitude]] greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific.{{sfn|Rodman|2005|pp=28<U+2013>29}} A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=42<U+2013>45}}

Walker resisted Kenney's proposals that the bombers conduct attacks from low level with bombs armed with instantaneous fuses.{{sfn|Byrd|1997|p=97}} Kenney ordered Walker to try the instantaneous fuses for a couple of months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness;{{sfn|Gamble|2010|p=241}} a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued the use of the instantaneous fuses. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS ''Pruth'', a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice.{{sfn|Gamble|2010|pp=272<U+2013>273}} After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck; but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, and bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=142}} A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid  over [[Rabaul]] when Kenney had ordered an attack by night.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=175-176}}

[[File:Dakotas fly into Wau.jpg|alt=Four twin-propeller aircraft fly over a mountain range|300px|thumb|left|Dakotas fly across the mountains towards [[Wau]].]]
Major [[Paul Gunn|Paul I. "Pappy" Gunn]]  modified some USAAF [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] light bombers by installing four {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s in their noses.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=76<U+2013>77}} Two {{convert|450|usgal|adj=on}} fuel tanks were added to give the aircraft more range. This was successful, and an attempt was then made to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]] to operate as a "commerce destroyer".{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=144}}{{sfn|Rodman|2005|pp=40<U+2013>42}} This proved to be somewhat more difficult. The resulting aircraft was obviously nose heavy despite adding lead ballast to the tail, and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=161<U+2013>162}} The tail guns and belly turrets were removed, the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low.{{sfn|Rodman|2005|pp=43<U+2013>44}}

The Mitchell crews developed a new technique called [[skip bombing]]. Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets, they would release their bombs, which would then, ideally, [[ricochet]] across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship, under it, or just over it. Another technique was mast height bombing, in which a bomber would approach the target at low altitude, {{convert|200|to|500|ft}}, at about {{convert|265|to|275|mph}}, and then drop down to mast height, {{convert|10|to|15|ft}} about {{convert|600|yd}} from the target. They would release their bombs at around {{convert|300|yd}}, aiming directly at the side of the ship. The [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level attacks on shipping.{{sfn|Rodman|2005|p=68}}

Another form of airpower employed by Kenney was air transport. This started in September 1942 when troops of the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Infantry Division]] were airlifted from Australia to [[Port Moresby]].{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=97-100}} Later in the campaign, [[C-47 Dakota]]s landed Australian troops at [[Wanigela, Oro Province|Wanigela]].{{sfn|Wolk|1987|pp=169-170}} A year later, American paratroops [[Landing at Nadzab|landed at Nadzab]], enabling the [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th Division]] to be flown in.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|pp=294-296}}

The ultimate challenge was to integrate air power with MacArthur's strategy. Kenney described the process this way in 1944:{{quote|The first step in this advancement of the bomber line is to gain and maintain air control as far into enemy territory as our longest range fighters can reach. Then we put an air blockade around the Jap positions or section of the coast which we want in order to stop him from getting supplies or reinforcements. The bombers then go to work and pulverize his defensive system, methodically taking out artillery positions, stores, bivouac areas and so on. Finally comes the air cover escorting the amphibious expedition to the landing beach, a last minute blasting and smoking of the enemy beach defenses and the maintenance of strafers and fighters overhead, on call from the surface forces until their beachhead is secured. If emergency supplies are needed we drop them by parachute. The ground troops get a transport field ready as fast as possible so that we can supplement boat supply by cargo carrying airplanes.  When necessary, we evacuate the wounded and sick and bring in reinforcements in a hurry. The transport field becomes a fighter field, the strafers and finally the heavies arrive and it is time to move forward again.{{sfn|Barr|1997|p=25}} }}

In June 1944 he was appointed commander of the Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, [[Thirteenth Air Force|Thirteenth]], and [[Seventh Air Force]]s. He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in a forward area for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington did not like it, and, over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task forces into the [[308th Bombardment Wing (World War II)|308th]], [[309th Air Division|309th]] and [[310th Air Division|310th Bombardment Wing]]s.{{sfn|Griffith|1998|p=175}} He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945.{{sfn|Fogerty|1953}}

Kenney's hoped to get [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es assigned to the Far East Air Forces so that, based from airfields near [[Darwin]], they could destroy the Japanese oilfields at [[Balikpapan]].{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|pp=59-61}}  His agitation to get B-29s assigned to SWPA did not endear him to the USAAF staff in Washington, D.C. After the war, the [[Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded that this would have been far more productive than [[Operation Matterhorn]], which saw B-29s based in China to bomb steel plants in Japan, as oil was more critical to the Japanese war effort than steel.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|pp=64-65}}

==Post-war==
In April 1946, Kenney became the first commander of the newly formed [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC). Kenney was encouraged by [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Stuart Symington]] to join him in the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force.{{sfn|Wolk|2002|p=71}} Separately, the two men gave promotional speeches around the country. As a result, SAC's efficiency suffered.{{sfn|Worden|1998|pp=55-56}} On 8 May 1946, Kenney publicly presented the [[Medal of Honor]] to the family of [[Thomas McGuire|Thomas B. McGuire, Jr]], the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot who was killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/e-books/mohB_airforce/page13_wwii.html |title=Air Force Medal of Honor Recipients |page=13 |publisher=HomeOfHeroes.com |year=2011 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>

Kenney left do-to-day operations at SAC in the hands of his deputy commander, Major General [[St. Clair Streett]]. In January 1947, Streett was replaced by Major General Clements McMullen. With McMullen serving officially as Kenney's deputy but actually in command, a cross-training program was implemented in early 1948 to teach bomber crew members each others' tasks, the goal being to reduce each bomber's contingent of officers from five to three. Morale suffered as a result. Major General [[Lauris Norstad]], responsible for reporting the readiness of American airpower to the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[James Forrestal]], heard from unhappy airmen that the SAC was in a poor state of readiness, and he initiated an investigation. He selected Charles Lindbergh and [[Paul Tibbets]] to perform the inquiry. Tibbets told Norstad that he found nobody at SAC knew their job.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|pp=1-5}} Lindbergh said that McMullen's cross-training program "seriously interfered with training the primary mission."{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|p=1}}

On 6 May 1948, Kenney spoke to a crowd in [[Bangor, Maine]], telling them that the US was likely to be attacked by the Soviet Union as soon as they had enough atomic bombs. In Washington, D.C., a group of senators including [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], complained of Kenney's "belligerent" speech, and previous ones in the same vein by Symington, saying that matters of foreign policy should be left to the president and the secretary of state, not to leaders of the United States Air Force (USAF).<ref name=Wolk2002>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5opVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nz8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5161,1854665&dq=george-kenney+bangor&hl=en |title=Urge Airforce Temper Talks: Senators Angry Over Belligerent Outbursts |work=Greensburg Daily Tribune |page=1 |date=May 8, 1948 |agency=United Press}}</ref> Another controversy that Kenney became embroiled in concerned the [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker]]. He was less than impressed with this expensive and under-performing aircraft, preferring the [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress]], an upgraded version of the B-29 instead. Unfortunately, the USAF had staked much of its credibility on the B-36, something that Kenney did not seem to appreciate.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|pp=75-80}}

In the context of the [[Berlin Blockade]] in June 1948, the [[Air Force Chief of Staff]], General [[Hoyt S. Vandenberg]] met with Forrestal to report the poor state of SAC. Following this meeting, Norstad recommended that Vandenberg replace Kenney, and Vandenberg quickly agreed, choosing Lieutenant General [[Curtis LeMay]] as the man he would prefer to lead the strategic bombing arm in case of war with the USSR.{{sfn|Grynkewich|1994|pp=1-5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/cc/kenn.html |title=George C. Kenney |work=American Airpower Biography |first=Phillip S. |last=Meilinger |publisher=AirChronicles |accessdate=2 July 1948}}</ref> LeMay was made leader of SAC, and Kenney became commander of the [[Air University (United States)|Air University]], a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=6041 |title=General George Churchill Kenney |publisher=United States Air Force |work=Biographies |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>

During a career that spanned over 30 years, Kenney was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with one oak leaf cluster, the Distinguished Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the [[Silver Star Medal]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (U.S.)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], the [[Purple Heart]] and several foreign decorations. Kenney wrote three books about the SWPA air campaigns he led during World War II. His major work was ''General Kenney Reports'' (1949), a personal history of the air war he led from 1942 to 1945. He also wrote ''The Saga of Pappy Gunn'' (1959) and ''Dick Bong: Ace of Aces'' (1960), which described the careers of Paul Gunn and [[Richard Bong]], two of the most prominent airmen under his command. After his retirement, he lived in [[Bay Harbor Islands, Florida]], where he died in 1977. He was survived by his two children, five grandsons and one granddaughter. His son, William "Bill" R. Kenney, rose to the rank of colonel in the USAF. His daughter, Julia, earned a [[B.A.]] in English at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1947. In 1948 she married Edward C. Hoagland Jr., a fighter pilot in World War II and later in Korea, who eventually retired from  the USAF at the rank of lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newspaperarchive.com/indiana-evening-gazette/1948-03-26/page-11 |work=Indiana Evening Gazette |title=Wedding Planned |date=26 March 1948 |page=1}}</ref>
