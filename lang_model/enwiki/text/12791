{{Bizet operas}}
'''''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles''''' (''The Pearl Fishers'') is an opera in three acts by the French composer [[Georges Bizet]], to a [[libretto]] by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Cormon]] and [[Michel Carr<U+00E9>]]. It was first performed on 30 September 1863 at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Lyrique#On the Place du Ch<U+00E2>telet|Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Lyrique]] in Paris, and was given 18 performances in its initial run. Set in ancient times on the island of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], the opera is a story of how two men's vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for the same woman, whose own dilemma is the conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess. The friendship duet [[Au Fond du Temple Saint|"Au fond du temple saint"]], generally known  as "The Pearl Fishers Duet", is one of the best-known numbers in Western opera. 

At the time of the premiere, Bizet was 25 years old and had yet to establish himself in the Parisian musical world. The commission to write ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs'' arose from his standing as a former winner of the prestigious [[Prix de Rome#Winners in the Musical Composition Category|Prix de Rome]]. Despite a good reception by the public, press reactions to the work were generally hostile and dismissive, although other composers, notably [[Hector Berlioz]], found considerable merit in the music. The opera was not revived in Bizet's lifetime, but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in Europe and America, and from the mid-20th century has entered the repertory of opera houses worldwide. Because the  autograph score was lost,  post-1886 productions were based on  amended versions of the score that contained significant departures from the original. However, since the 1970s, efforts have been made to reconstruct the score in accordance with Bizet's intentions. 

Modern critical opinion has been kinder than that  of Bizet's day. Commentators  describe the quality of the music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of  promise in which Bizet's  gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident.  They have identified clear premonitions of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in ''[[Carmen]]''. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the amended and original versions.

==Background==

Bizet's first opera, the one-act ''[[Le docteur Miracle]]'', was written in 1856 when the 18-year-old composer was a student at the [[Paris Conservatoire]]. It was Bizet's winning entry in a competition organised by the celebrated composer [[Jacques Offenbach]], and gained him a cash award, a gold medal, and a performance of the prize work at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Bouffes-Parisiens]].<ref>Dean (1965), pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref>  In 1857 Bizet was awarded the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]], and as a result spent most of the following three years in Italy where he wrote ''[[Don Procopio]]'', a short [[opera buffa]] in the style of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]].<ref>Dean (1965), p. 20</ref> By this time Bizet had written several non-stage works, including his [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]], but the poor reception accorded to his 1858 ''Te Deum'', a religious work he composed in Rome,  helped  convince him that his future lay primarily with the musical theatre.<ref>Curtiss, pp. 68<U+2013>71</ref> He planned and possibly began several operatic works before his return to Paris in 1860, but none of these projects came to fruition.<ref name= D260>Dean (1965), pp. 260<U+2013>61</ref>

In Paris, Bizet discovered the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers trying to get their operas performed. Of the capital's two state-subsidised opera houses, [[Paris Opera|the Op<U+00E9>ra]] and the [[Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique]], the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers, particularly [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], were dominant. Even established French composers such as [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] had difficulty getting works performed there.<ref name= Steen586>Steen, p. 586</ref><ref name= D36>Dean (1965), pp. 36<U+2013>39</ref>  At the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique, innovation was equally rare; although more French works were performed, the style and character of most productions had hardly changed since the 1830s.<ref name= Steen586/> However, one condition of the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique's state funding was that from time to time it should produce one-act works  by former Prix de Rome laureates. Under this provision, Bizet had written ''La guzla de l'Emir'', with a libretto by [[Jules Barbier]] and [[Michel Carr<U+00E9>]], and this went into rehearsal early in 1862.<ref name= D47>Dean (1965), pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref>

In April 1862, as the ''La guzla'' rehearsals proceeded, Bizet was approached by [[L<U+00E9>on Carvalho]],  manager of the  independent [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Lyrique]] company. Carvalho had been offered an annual grant of 100,000 francs by the retiring Minister of Fine Arts, [[Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski|Count Walewski]], on condition that each year he  stage a new three-act opera from a recent Prix de Rome winner.  Carvalho had a high opinion of Bizet's abilities, and offered him the  libretto of ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'', an exotic story by Carr<U+00E9> and  [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Cormon]] set on the island of Ceylon  (now [[Sri Lanka]]).  Sensing the opportunity for a genuine theatrical success, Bizet accepted the commission. Because Walewski restricted his grant to  composers who had not had any previous work performed commercially, Bizet hurriedly withdrew ''La guzla'' from the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique; it has never been performed, and the music has disappeared.<ref name= D47/>

==Synopsis==
:Place: [[Ceylon]]
:Time: Ancient times

===Act 1===
The scene is a desolate seashore,  with the ruins of a Hindu temple in the background. A chorus of pearl fishermen  sing of the dangerous tasks that lie ahead ("Sur la gr<U+00E8>ve en feu"), and perform ritual dances to drive away evil spirits. They then elect one of their number, Zurga, as their leader or "king".  Nadir enters, and is hailed by Zurga as a long-lost friend.  Left alone, the pair reminisce about their past in the city of Kandy, when their friendship was nearly destroyed by their mutual love of a young priestess whose beauty they had glimpsed briefly. They had each renounced their love for this stranger and had sworn to remain true to each other. Now, reunited, they affirm once again that they will be faithful until death ("Au fond du temple saint").

A boat draws up on the beach bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the  virgin priestess whose prayers are required to ensure the safety of the fishermen. Though not recognised by either of the men, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties she recognises Nadir, though she  says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad.  Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps  he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman ("Je crois entendre encore"). It is the rumour that she might be found in this place that has brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover,  traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is her and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("O Dieu Brahma").

===Act 2===
In the temple with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts her to be brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once displayed when, as a child, she hid a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death ("J'<U+00E9>tais encore enfant"). The fugitive had rewarded her  with a necklace that he asked  her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows.  On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly ("Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre"). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet ("L<U+00E9><U+00EF>la! L<U+00E9><U+00EF>la!...Dieu puissant, le voil<U+00E0>!"). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is  captured by the fishermen and brought back to the temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love;  consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").

===Act 3===
In his tent on the beach, Zurga notes that the storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir ("L'orage est calm<U+00E9>"). Leila is brought in; Zurga is  captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy ("Je suis jaloux"). Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter, to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace. 

Outside the temple, Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipate the dawn and the coming double execution ("D<U+00E8>s que le soleil"). He is  joined by Leila;  resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, as Zurga  rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He  returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals that he is the man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return ("Plus de crainte...R<U+00EA>ves d'amour, adieu!").

(In the revised version of the ending introduced after the opera's 1886 revival, Nourabad witnesses Zurga's freeing of the prisoners and denounces him to the fishermen, one of whom stabs Zurga to death as the last notes sound of Leila and Nadir's farewell song. In some variations Zurga meets his death in other ways, and his body is consigned to the pyre.)

==Writing and compositional history==
[[File:Carre Head and shoulders.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A man with dark receding hair, heavy moustache and a severe expression looks directly at the camera|Michel Carr<U+00E9>, who co-wrote the libretto with Eug<U+00E8>ne Cormon]]
The libretto was written by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Cormon]] and [[Michel Carr<U+00E9>]]. Cormon, whose real name was Pierre-Etienne Piestre, was a prolific author of libretti and straight drama, usually in collaboration with other writers. In his career he wrote or co-wrote at least 135 works, of which ''[[Les dragons de Villars]]'', set to music by [[Aim<U+00E9> Maillart]], was perhaps the most successful.<ref>{{cite web|last= Wright|first= Lesley A|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O005597?q=Eugene+Cormon&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title= Cormon, Eug<U+00E8>ne (Piestre, Pierre-Etienne) |publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 14 November 2011}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Carr<U+00E9>, who had initially trained as a painter, had worked with [[Jules Barbier]] on Gounod's opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and  had co-written the play ''Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann'', which became the basis of the libretto for Offenbach's opera ''[[Contes d'Hoffmann]]''. Before ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' Cormon and Carr<U+00E9> had previously written a libretto for  Maillart on a similar theme, ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de Catane'', which had been performed in 1860; they had originally planned to set their new story in Mexico before changing its location to Ceylon.<ref>{{cite web|last= Smith|first= Christopher|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O004941?q=Michel+Carr&search=quick&pos=2&_start=1#firsthit|title= 
Carr<U+00E9>, Michel (-Florentin)|publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 14 November 2011}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

By general critical consent the libretto of ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' is a work of poor quality.  The weak plot, as Bizet's biographer [[Winton Dean]] observes, turns on the unlikely coincidence regarding Leila's necklace, and no real effort is made in the text to bring any of the characters to life: "They are the regulation sopranos, tenors, etc., with their faces blacked".<ref name= D170>Dean (1965), p. 170<U+2013>71</ref> Mina Curtiss, in her book on Bizet, dismisses the text as  banal and imitative.<ref name= C135/> [[Donal Henahan]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing in 1986,  said that the libretto "rank[ed] right down there with the most appallingly inept of its kind".<ref name= NYT/> The writers themselves admitted its shortcomings: Cormon commented later that had they been aware of Bizet's quality as a composer, they would have tried harder.<ref name= D170/>  Carr<U+00E9> was worried about the weak ending, and constantly sought suggestions for changing it; Curtiss records that in exasperation, the theatre manager Carvalho suggested that Carr<U+00E9> burn the libretto. This facetious remark, Curtiss asserts, led Carr<U+00E9> to end the opera with the fishermen's tents ablaze as Leila and Nadir make their escape.<ref name= C135>Curtiss, p. 135</ref>

Because he did not receive Carvalho's commission until April 1863, with the projected opening night set for mid-September, Bizet  composed quickly with, Curtiss says, "a tenacity and concentration quite foreign to him in his Roman days".<ref>Curtiss, p. 133</ref> He had some music available on which he could draw; through the previous winter he had worked on the score of an opera, ''Ivan IV'' with the  promise, which fell through, that the work would be staged in [[Baden-Baden]].  ''Ivan IV'' provided music for three numbers in ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'': the prelude; part of Zurga's "Une fille inconnue"; and the third act duet "O lumi<U+00E8>re sainte". The "Brahma divin Brahma" chorus was adapted from the rejected ''Te Deum'', and the chorus "Ah chante, chante encore" from ''Don Procopio''.<ref>Lacombe, p. 312</ref> It is also likely that music composed for the cancelled ''La guzla d l'Emir''  found its way into the new opera's score, which was completed by early August.<ref name= D51/>  The libretto was changed frequently  during the creation process, even when the work had reached the rehearsal stage; the chorus "L'ombre descende" was added at Bizet's request, and other numbers were shortened or removed.<ref>Lacombe, pp. 314<U+2013>15</ref>

==Performance history and reception==
===Premiere and initial run===
[[File:Place du Chatelet (sharper) by Edouard Baldus.jpg|thumb|alt= A city riverside scene with a bridge to the right. On the far bank are several buildings, the line of which is broken by a tall tower.|The Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Lyrique (centre right), Paris, where ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' received its first performance on 30 September 1863]]
The  premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed  to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, L<U+00E9>ontine de Ma<U+00EB>sen.  The first-night audience at the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer [[Louis Gallet]], who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..."<ref name= D51>Dean (1965), pp. 50<U+2013>52</ref> The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand  in ''Le M<U+00E9>nestrel'' wrote that "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a "claque" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.<ref name= C137>Curtiss, pp. 137<U+2013>39</ref>

Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote: "There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music". He considered that on every page the score displayed "the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner".<ref name= C137/>  Bertrand  compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Gounod and [[F<U+00E9>licien-C<U+00E9>sar David]]. "Nevertheless", he wrote, "there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations".<ref name= C137/> [[Hector Berlioz]] was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in ''[[Journal des d<U+00E9>bats|Journal des D<U+00E9>bats]]'' praised the music's originality and subtlety: "The score of ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' does M. Bizet the greatest honour", he wrote.<ref name= D51/> Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist [[Ludovic Hal<U+00E9>vy]] wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: "I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues".<ref name= C137/>   The youthful composer [[<U+00C9>mile Paladilhe]] told his father that the opera was superior to anything that the established French opera composers of the day, such as  [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Ambroise Thomas|Thomas]],  were capable of producing.<ref name= D51/> 

In its initial run ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' ran for 18 performances, alternating with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''The Marriage of Figaro''. It closed on 23 November 1863, and although it brought the theatre little financial success, Bizet had won admiration from his peers.   Carvalho was satisfied enough to ask Bizet  to quickly finish ''Ivan IV'',   with a view to its early production at the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Lyrique. This idea  eventually came to nothing; ''Ivan IV'' remained unperformed until 1946.<ref name= D51/><ref name= C137/>

===Early revivals===
After  its opening run, ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs'' was not performed again until 11 years after Bizet's death when, on 20 March 1886, it was presented in Italian at [[La Scala]], [[Milan]].  After this it  received regular stagings in  European cities,  often with the Italian version of the libretto.<ref name= Amadeus>{{cite web|title= Almanacco di Gherardo Caseglia (Georges Bizet)|url= http://www.amadeusonline.net/almanacco.php?Start=0&Giorno=&Mese=&Anno=&Giornata=&Testo=Bizet&Parola=Stringa|publisher= AmadeusOnline|accessdate= 4 November 2011}} (in Italian)</ref> These revivals, which possibly reflected the growing success of ''Carmen'', were followed by the publication of several versions of the music that incorporated significant differences from Bizet's original.<ref name= Mac/> In particular the finale  was altered, to provide a more dramatic ending<U+2014>"a grand Meyerbeerian holocaust" according to Dean.<ref name= D288>Dean (1965), pp. 288<U+2013>89</ref>  This revised conclusion included a trio composed by [[Benjamin Godard]], an interpolation which modern critics have described as deplorable. Nevertheless, these corrupted scores remained the basis of productions for nearly a century.<ref name= D288/><ref name= PBS/> 

The opera received its British premiere on 22 April 1887, at London's [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], under the title ''Leila''. The part of Nadir was sung by [[Paul Lh<U+00E9>rie]], the original Don Jos<U+00E9> in the 1875 ''Carmen''.<ref name= Mac/> Press reactions were muted; ''[[The Times]]''{{'}}s music critic  found much of the music  incompatible with the exotic setting<U+2014>the hymn to Brahma was, he suggested, reminiscent of a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] chorale.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Bizet's ''Leila''|journal= The Times|date= 25 April 1887|pages= p. 4}}</ref> ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s reporter found "no trace of genuine inspiration", and drew unfavourable comparisons with ''Carmen''.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Royal Italian Opera|journal= The Observer|date= 24 April 1887|pages= p. 2}}</ref> When Covent Garden repeated the production in May 1889 the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] and other members of the British royal family were present.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Royal Italian Opera|journal= The Times|date= 20 May 1889|pages= p. 1}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]''{{'}}s correspondent praised the  singers but found that the work "becomes weaker and weaker as it goes on".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Opening of the Italian Opera|journal= The Manchester Guardian|date= 20 May 1889|pages= p. 8}}</ref>

''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs'' returned to Paris on 20 April 1889, when it was performed<U+2014>in Italian<U+2014>at the  [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de la Ga<U+00EE>t<U+00E9> (rue Papin)|Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de la Ga<U+00EE>t<U+00E9>]]. Despite a distinguished cast<U+2014>[[Emma Calv<U+00E9>]], [[Jean-Alexandre Talazac]] and  Lh<U+00E9>rie, now a baritone, in the role of Zurga<U+2014>critical reviews were no more enthusiastic than those which had greeted the original performances. ''Le M<U+00E9>nestrel'' excused Bizet on account of his youth,<ref>{{cite journal|title= Inauguration de l'Op<U+00E9>ra-Italien|journal= Le M<U+00E9>nestrel|date= 28 April 1889|pages= p. 131}} (in French)</ref> while ''The Manchester Guardian''{{'}}s report summed up the Parisian view of the work as "almost entirely lacking in ... boldness & originality".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Literary and Other Notes|journal= The Manchester Guardian|date= 6 May 1889|pages= p. 8}}</ref>  On 24 April 1893 Carvalho  revived the work, in French, at the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique, its first performance at what would later become its regular home.<ref name= Mac/>

Productions continued to proliferate in Europe, and further afield; on 25 August 1893 the opera received its American premiere in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name= Amadeus/>  Two-and-a-half years later, on 11 January 1896, the first two acts were performed at the New York [[Metropolitan Opera]] (the "Met"), as part of a programme that included  [[Jules Massenet]]'s one-act opera ''[[La Navarraise]]''. The cast was led by Calv<U+00E9> and the Italian baritone [[Mario Ancona]]. The Met's first complete staging of the opera came 20 years later, on 13 November 1916, when a star cast that included [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Frieda Hempel]] and [[Giuseppe De Luca]] gave three performances. According to W.H. Chase in the ''Evening Sun'', the Act I duet "brought down the house in a superb blending of the two men's voices"; later, in "Je crois entendre encore", Caruso "did some of the most artistic singing in plaintive minor". In ''The Sun'', W.J. Henderson, praised  Hempel for her "ravishing upper tones", Da Luca was "a master of the delicate finish", and the bass [[L<U+00E9>on Rothier]], in the small part of Nourabad, "filled Bizet's requirements perfectly".<ref name= Metarchiv>{{cite web|title= Metopera Database: The Metropolitan Opera Archives|url= http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm|publisher= The Metropolitan Archive|accessdate=  November 2011}} (Key word search ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'')</ref>

After the Second World War, although the opera was shunned by  Covent Garden, the [[English National Opera#Sadler's Wells Opera|Sadler's Wells]] company presented it in March 1954.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Pearl Fishers|journal= [[The Age]]|date= 19 March 1954|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19540319&id=BdRVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YscDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6574,2604931|pages= p. 4}}</ref>  ''The Times'' announced this production as the first known use in Britain of the opera's  English libretto.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The Pearl Fishers|journal= The Times|date= 18 January 1954|pages= p. 4}}</ref>  The stage designs for this production, which was directed by [[Basil Coleman]], were by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]].<ref>Britten et al, p. 177</ref> In the early 1970s, [[Arthur Hammond (musician)|Arthur Hammond]] orchestrated the sections of the neglected 1863 vocal score that had been cut out from the post-1886 scores.<ref name= L311>Lacombe, p. 311</ref> This led to a production in 1973, by [[Welsh National Opera]], of a version close to Bizet's original, without Godard's trio and Zurga's violent death<U+2014>the first modern performance to incorporate the original ending.<ref name= PBS>{{cite journal|last= Whitson|first= James C.|title= Perles Before Swine|journal= Opera News|date= October 2008|volume= 73|issue= 4|pages= pp. 34<U+2013>36}}</ref><ref name= Mac>{{cite web|last= Macdonald|first= Hugh|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O903766?q=Les+pecheurs+de+perles&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title= P<U+00EA>cheurs de perles, Les |publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 11 October 2011}}{{subscription required}}</ref> 

The Sadler's Wells production was revived several times, but it was not until September 1987 that the company, by then transformed into [[English National Opera]], replaced it with a new staging directed by [[Philip Prowse]].<ref>Gilbert, pp. 406<U+2013>07</ref> ''The Guardian''{{'}}s report  on this production mentioned that the "Pearl Fishers Duet" had recently topped the list in a poll of the public's "best tunes", and described the opera as "one of the most sweetly tuneful in the French repertory".

In the latter years of the 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still breaking new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the [[Slovak National Theatre]] in [[Bratislava]].<ref name= Amadeus/> [[Vienna]] saw it for the first time in 1994, at the [[Vienna Volksoper]], in what [[John Rockwell]] in the ''New York Times'' described as "an awkwardly updated production", though well performed.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= John Rockwell|last= Rockwell|first= John|title= Trials of an Opera Troupe that's 2d Fiddle|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/arts/critic-s-notebook-trials-of-an-opera-troupe-that-s-2d-fiddle.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|journal= The New York Times|date= 19 March 1994}}</ref> The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916,  performances had been  rare by comparison with Europe. The [[Chicago Lyric Opera]]  staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before repeating it.<ref name= PBS/> In 1980 the [[New York City Opera]] mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and revived it in 1983 and 1986.  Reviewing the 1986 production,  Henahan  wrote that despite the inept libretto  the work was saved by the "melodic suppleness and warmth" of Bizet's score.<ref name= NYT>{{cite journal|authorlink= Donal Henahan|last= Henahan|first= Donal|title= City Opera: "Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/17/arts/city-opera-les-pecheurs-de-perles.html|journal= The New York Times|date= 17 July 1986}}</ref> [[San Diego Opera]] first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's spectacular 2004 production, designed by [[Zandra Rhodes]], that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C. Whitson, in ''Opera News'', reported that worldwide, "between 2007 and 2009, half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S.".<ref name= PBS/> San Diego's director, Ian Campbell, suggested that his company's 2004 production was "created at a time when it seemed many U.S. opera companies were looking for a not-too-expensive production with melody, and a little off the beaten track .... [Our] ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' fitted the bill''.<ref name= PBS/>

In January 2008 the opera received its first performance in Sri Lanka, the land of its setting. The conductor, Benjamin Levy, directed a large group of singers and musicians, mostly young and local.<ref>{{cite web|title= Opera's historic Sri Lanka first|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7180605.stm|publisher= BBC News|date= 10 January 2008|accessdate= 12 November 2022}}</ref> Against a background of increasing esteem, the opera was reintroduced to London's Royal Opera House in October 2011, after an interval of more than 120 years. Two concert performances were given using a new edition of the score, prepared by [[Brad Cohen (conductor)|Brad Cohen]] after the discovery in the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que nationale de France]] of Bizet's 1863 conducting score.<ref name= L311/> Commenting on this performance in ''The Daily Telegraph'', [[Rupert Christiansen]] drew attention to the "musing intimacy and quiet dignity" with which the  duet was sung, as compared with more traditional macho renderings.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Rupert Christiansen|last= Christiansen|first= Rupert|title= Les P<U+00EA>cheurs de Perles, Royal Opera House|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8044022/Les-Pecheurs-de-Perles-Royal-Opera-House-review.html|journal= the Daily Telegraph|date= 5 October 2010}}</ref>  In publishing its plans for the 2011<U+2013>12 season, the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique announced a new production of the opera for June 2012, with stage designs by Yoshi Oida.<ref>{{cite web|title= Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles|url= http://www.opera-comique.com/en/les-pecheurs-de-perles/les-pecheurs-de-perles1.html|publisher= L'Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique|accessdate= 8 November 2011}}</ref>

The opera begins with a brief orchestral prelude, the principal theme of which prefigures Leila's entrance.<ref name= D170/>  The opening chorus is punctuated by a dance which the critic John W. Klein  describes as "electrifying".<ref name= Klein/> Nadir's first significant contribution is his aria "Des savanes et des for<U+00EA>ts", sung to an accompaniment of cellos and bassoons under a string [[tremolo]] that shows, Dean suggests, the influence of Meyerbeer.<ref name= D175/> Flutes and harps are used to introduce the main theme of the celebrated "Pearl Fishers Duet", in what the opera historian Herv<U+00E9> Lacombe identifies  as "the most highly developed poetic scene in the opera".<ref name= L175>Lacombe, pp. 175<U+2013>78</ref>  The duet's theme  has become the opera's principal musical signature,  repeated in the work whenever the issue of the men's friendship arises<U+2014>though in Dean's view  the tune is not worthy of the weight it carries.<ref name= D170/>{{#tag:ref|In the amended post-1886 versions of the score the duet is extended by the removal of the following number, "Amiti<U+00E9> sainte", which is replaced with a repeat of the duet. Some critics think that this arrangement is superior to Bizet's original.<ref name= Avis/><ref name= G31/>|group= n}} Bizet's ability to find  the appropriate musical phrase with style and economy is better demonstrated, Dean suggests, in his treatment of Leila's oath of chastity, where a simple phrase is repeated twice in [[minor third]] steps.<ref name= D175>Dean (1965), pp. 175<U+2013>77</ref> Nadir's aria "Je crois entendre encore", towards the end of Act 1, is written on a [[barcarole]] rhythm, with a dominant [[cor anglais]] whereby, says Lacombe, "[t]he listener has the impression that the horn is singing".<ref name= L175/>

In Act 2 a short orchestral introduction is followed by an off-stage chorus, notable for its sparse accompaniment<U+2014>a [[tambourine]] and two [[piccolo]]s. After Nourabad reminds Leila of her oath and leaves her alone she sings her cavatina  "Comme autrefois". Two [[French horn]]s introduce the theme, supported by the cellos. When her voice enters, says Lacombe, "it replaces the first horn whose characteristic sound it seems to continue". Dean likens this song to Micaela's aria "Je dis que rien ne m'<U+00E9>pouvante" from ''Carmen''.<ref name= D170/>  Nadir's "De mon amie" which follows the cavatina has, says Dean, "a haunting beauty"; its introductory phrase recalls the oboe theme in Bizet's youthful [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]].<ref name= D172>Dean (1965), pp. 172<U+2013>74</ref> Dean cites the second act finale, with its repeated climaxes as the crowds demand the errant couple's deaths, as an example of Bizet's developing skills in writing theatrical music.<ref name= D175/> The third act, divided into two brief scenes, begins with Zurga's entrance to quiet [[Chromatic scale|chromatic scales]] played over a [[pedal tone|tonic pedal]], an effect  that Bizet would later use in his incidental music to ''[[L'Arl<U+00E9>sienne (Bizet)|L'Arl<U+00E9>sienne]]''.<ref name= D172/> The duet "Je fr<U+00E9>mis", says Dean, has clear hints of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] ''[[Il trovatore]]'', and the fiery chorus "D<U+00E8>s que le soleil" is reminiscent of a [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] scherzo, but otherwise the final act's music is weak and lacking in dramatic force.<ref name= D175/> In the closing scene, in which Zurga bids a last farewell to his dreams of love, the friendship theme from the Act 1 duet sounds for the final time.<ref name= Avis/>

According to Lacombe,  ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'' is characteristic of French ''[[opera lyrique|op<U+00E8>ra lyrique]]'', in particular through Bizet's use of [[arioso]] and dramatic [[recitative]], his creation of atmospheres, and his evocation of the exotic.<ref>Lacombe, p. 249</ref> Berlioz described the opera's score as beautiful, expressive, richly coloured and  full of fire, but Bizet himself did not regard the work highly, and thought that, a few numbers apart, it deserved oblivion.<ref name= Klein/> Parisian critics of the day, attuned to the gentler sounds of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and Offenbach, complained about the heaviness of Bizet's orchestration, which they said was noisy, overloaded and Wagnerian<U+2014>"a fortissimo in  three acts".<ref name= D175/> The conductor [[Hans von B<U+00FC>low]] dismissed the work contemptuously as "a tragical operetta", and when it was revived after 1886, resented having to conduct it.<ref name= Klein/> Modern writers have generally treated the piece more generously; the music may be of uneven quality and over-reflective of the works of Bizet's contemporaries, says Dean, but there are interesting hints of his mature accomplishments.<ref name= D1980>Dean (1980), pp. 754<U+2013>55</ref> Others have given credit to the composer for overcoming the limitations of the libretto with some genuinely dramatic strokes and the occasional inspiring melody.<ref name= PBS/>

==Musical numbers==
The listing is based on  the 1977 EMI recording, which used the 1863 vocal score. In the post-1886 revisions the Act 1  "Amiti<U+00E9> sainte" duet was replaced with a reprise of "Au fond du temple saint".<ref name= Avis>Avis, Peter (1990).

"O lumi<U+00E8>re sainte", was recomposed by Benjamin Godard as a trio for Nadir, Leila and Zurga.<ref name= D288/>

==Editions==

Having completed the score of ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs'' in August 1863, Bizet fell out with his publisher, Choudens, over publication rights. The quarrel was patched up and Choudens retained the rights, but published only a piano vocal score in 1863.<ref name= D51/> After Bizet's death in 1875 his widow [[Genevi<U+00E8>ve Hal<U+00E9>vy| Genevi<U+00E8>ve Bizet]] showed scant care for her husband's musical legacy; several of his autograph scores, including that of ''Les p<U+00EA>cheurs de perles'', were lost or given away.<ref>Curtiss, p. 440</ref> Choudens published a second piano vocal score in 1887<U+2013>88 and a "nouvelle <U+00E9>dition" in 1893 that incorporated the changes that had been introduced into recent revivals of the opera. A full orchestral score based on the nouvelle edition was published in 1893.<ref name= L311/><ref name= D1980/>

A trend towards greater authenticity began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided a basis for staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six [[staff (music)|staves]], but  notes and other markings in the manuscript  provided additional clues to the original  orchestration.<ref name= L311/> These new finds became the basis for Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by [[Edition Peters]] in 2002.<ref name= Mac/><ref>{{cite web|title= Profile: Brad Cohen|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/maestro/whos-who/the-mentors/brad-cohen/|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 2011|accessdate= 24 November 2011}}</ref>

==Recordings==
The first complete recordings of the opera were issued in the early 1950s. Before then, numerous recordings of individual numbers had been issued;<ref name= Gram75/> the duet "Au fond du temple saint", sung in Italian by Caruso and [[Mario Ancona]], was recorded as early as  1907.<ref>{{cite web|title= Mario Ancona & Enrico Caruso - Pearl Fishers duet 1907|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lGVEZAsrgE|publisher= You Tube|accessdate= 11 November 2010}}</ref>  The 1919 edition of ''The Victrola Book of the Opera''  lists available recordings of several of the solo numbers, the duet, the orchestral prelude, the chorus "Brahma! divin Brahma!" and the Act 3 finale, mainly sung in Italian.<ref>Rous, p. 312</ref> The 1977 Pr<U+00E9>tre recording  of the complete opera  was the first to be based on the 1863 original as represented in Bizet's  vocal score. The Platini version of 1989, while using the 1863 score, gives listeners two versions of the duet: the curtailed form in which it appeared in Bizet's original, and the extended version in which it became more popularly known.<ref name = G31>March (ed.), p. 31</ref> Brad Cohen's highlights version, sung in English and based on the conductor's adaptation of Bizet's conducting score, also provides both versions of the duet.<ref name= Cohen/>
