{{Campaignbox American Revolutionary War: Northern 1775}}

'''Washington's crossing of the Delaware River''', which occurred on December&nbsp;25, 1776, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], was the first move in a surprise attack organized by [[George Washington]] against the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] forces in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. Planned in partial secrecy, Washington led a column of [[Continental Army]] troops across the icy [[Delaware River]] in a logistically challenging and potentially dangerous operation.  Other planned crossings in support of the operation were either called off or ineffective, but this did not prevent Washington from successfully [[Battle of Trenton|surprising and defeating]] the troops of [[Johann Rall]] quartered in Trenton.  The army crossed the river back to Pennsylvania, this time burdened by prisoners and military stores taken as a result of the battle.

Washington's army then crossed the river a third time at the end of the year, under conditions made more difficult by the uncertain thickness of the ice on the river.  They [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|defeated British reinforcements]] under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] on January&nbsp;2, 1777, and [[Battle of Princeton|defeated his rear guard]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] before retreating to winter quarters in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].

==Background==
{{main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
While 1776 had begun well for the American cause with the evacuation of British troops from [[Boston]] in March, the defense of [[New York City]] had gone quite poorly.  British General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] had landed troops on [[Long Island]] in August and had pushed [[George Washington]]'s [[Continental Army]] completely out of [[New York]] by mid-November, when he [[Battle of Fort Washington|captured the remaining troops]] on [[Manhattan]].<ref>Dwyer, p. 5</ref>  Howe then sent troops under the command of [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the [[Hudson River]] into [[New Jersey]] and chased Washington across New Jersey.  Washington's army was shrinking, due to expiring enlistments and desertions, and suffered from poor morale, due to the defeats in the New York area.  Most of Washington's army crossed the [[Delaware River]] into [[Pennsylvania]] north of [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and destroyed or moved to the western shore all boats for miles in both directions.  Howe and Cornwallis, rather than attempting to immediately chase Washington further, established a chain of outposts from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] to [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]], including ones at [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown]] and Trenton, and ordered his troops into winter quarters.<ref>The retreat is recounted in detail by Dwyer, pp. 24<U+2013>112</ref>

==Washington's army==
Washington encamped the army near McKonkey's Ferry, not far from the crossing site.  While Washington at first took quarters across the river from [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]],  he moved on December 15 to the [[Keith House-Washington's Headquarters|house of William Keith]] to be closer to the army.  When Washington's army first arrived at McKonkey's Ferry he had four to six thousand men, although 1,700 soldiers were unfit for duty and needed hospital care. In the retreat across New Jersey Washington had lost precious supplies, as well as losing contact with two important divisions of his army. General [[Horatio Gates]] was in the [[Hudson River Valley]] and General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] was in western New Jersey with 2,000 men.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 208<U+2013>209, 265</ref> Washington had ordered both generals to join him, but Gates was delayed by heavy snows en route, and Lee, who did not have a high opinion of Washington, delayed following repeated orders, preferring to remain on the British flank near [[Morristown, New Jersey]].<ref>Ketchum, pp. 249<U+2013>254,265</ref><ref>Dwyer, p. 130</ref>

Washington had additional problems, including the fact that the enlistments of many of his men were expiring.<ref>Fischer, p. 129</ref> The series of lost battles and the retreat from New York had left morale very low in Philadelphia, where many residents and the [[Second Continental Congress]] fled to the south.<ref>Fischer, p. 136</ref> Many soldiers were inclined to leave the army once their commission was finished, and several had taken the opportunity to desert the army before their enlistments were up.<ref>Dwyer, p. 120</ref> Orders were issued to bring supplies to the camp, and men were dispatched to recruit new soldiers, who did slowly begin to arrive at the camp.<ref>Fischer, pp. 150<U+2013>152</ref>  Militia recruiting in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania was also successful, spurred on by British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey's residents.<ref name=F191_5/>

[[Image:PaineAmericanCrisis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|First page of [[Thomas Paine|Paine]]'s ''[[The American Crisis]]'']]
Morale was given a boost on December 19 by the publication of a new pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]]. ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' had served to increase support for the Revolution in its early days, and Paine's new pamphlet, titled ''[[The American Crisis]]'', began with words well-known to American schoolchildren:<ref>Ketchum, pp. 210<U+2013>211</ref>

{{cquote|These are the times that try men's souls; the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it ''now,'' deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.}}

Within a day of its publication in Philadelphia, General Washington ordered it be read to his troops.  While Paine's writing could not feed or shelter the troops, it did serve to improve morale and help them feel a little more tolerant of their current conditions.<ref>Ketchum, p. 295</ref>  Some provisions, including much-needed blankets, arrived in the Continental Army camp on Christmas Eve.<ref>Fischer, p. 156</ref>

On December 20 an event took place that gave another boost to morale. General Lee's division of 2,000 arrived in camp under the command of General [[John Sullivan]].<ref name=K290>Ketchum, p. 290</ref> General Lee had been captured by the British on December 12, when he ventured too far outside the protection of his troops in search of more comfortable lodgings (or, according to rumors, an assignation).<ref>Dwyer, pp. 141<U+2013>145</ref> Later that same day General Gates' division arrived in camp, reduced to 600 by ending enlistments and the need to keep the northern frontier secure.<ref name=K290/> Soon after, another 1,000 militia men from Philadelphia under Colonel John Cadwalader joined Washington. As a result of these reinforcements and smaller numbers of volunteers from the local area, Washington now had 6,000 listed as fit for duty. Of this number, a large portion were detailed to guard the ferries at [[Bristol, Pennsylvania|Bristol]] and [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]]. Another group was placed to protect supplies at [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania]] and to guard the sick and wounded who would remain behind when the army crossed the Delaware River.<ref name=F191_5>Fischer, pp. 191<U+2013>195</ref> This left Washington with about 2,400 men able to take offensive action against the Hessian and British troops in Central New Jersey.<ref name="F208"/>

==Planning the attack==
[[Image:Passage of the Delaware.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Depiction of the crossing by [[Thomas Sully]], 1819]]
General Washington had been considering some sort of bold move since arriving in Pennsylvania.  With the arrival of Sullivan's and Gates' forces and the influx of militia companies, he felt the time was finally right for some sort of action.  He first considered an attack on the southernmost British positions near [[Mount Holly Township, New Jersey|Mount Holly]], where a militia force had gathered.  He sent his adjutant, [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]], to meet with [[Samuel Griffin]], the militia commander.  Reed arrived in Mount Holly on December 22, found Griffin to be ill, and his men in relatively poor condition, but willing to make some sort of diversion.<ref>Dwyer, p. 210</ref>  (This they did with the [[Battle of Iron Works Hill]] the next day, drawing the Hessians at Bordentown far enough south that they would be unable to come to the assistance of the Trenton garrison.)<ref>Dwyer, pp. 216<U+2013>217</ref>  The intelligence gathered by Reed and others led Washington to abandon the idea of attacking for Mount Holly, preferring instead to target the Trenton garrison. He announced this decision to his staff on December 23, saying the attack would take place just before daybreak on December 26.<ref>Dwyer, pp. 211<U+2013>212</ref>

Washington's final plan was for three crossings, with his troops, the largest contingent, to lead the attack on Trenton. A second column under Lieutenant Colonel [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] was to cross at Dunk's Ferry, near [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]], and create a diversion to the south. A third column under Brigadier General [[James Ewing (Pennsylvania)|James Ewing]] was to cross at Trenton Ferry and hold the bridge across the [[Assunpink Creek]], just south of Trenton, in order to prevent the enemy's escape by that route. Once Trenton was secure, the combined army would move against the British posts in Princeton and New Brunswick.  A fourth crossing, by men provided by General [[Israel Putnam]] to assist Cadwalader, was dropped after Putnam indicated he did not have enough men fit for the operation.<ref>Dwyer, pp. 212<U+2013>213</ref>

Preparations for the attack began on December 23. On December 24 the boats used to bring the army across the Delaware from New Jersey were brought down from Malta Island near [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]] and hidden behind Taylor Island at McKonkey's Ferry, Washington's planned crossing site, and security was tightened there. A final planning meeting took place that day, with all of the general officers present.  General orders were issued by Washington on December 25 outlining plans for the operation.<ref>Ketchum, p. 293</ref>

==Watercraft==
[[Image:WashingtonCrossingReenactment2005.jpg|thumb|right|Reenactors cross the river in [[Durham boat]]s]]
A wide variety of watercraft were assembled for the crossing, primarily through the work of militia men from the surrounding counties in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the assistance of the [[Pennsylvania Navy]].  In addition to the large ferry vessels (which were big enough to carry large coaches, and likely served for carrying horses and artillery during the crossing), a large number of [[Durham boat]]s were used to transport soldiers across the river.  These boats were designed to carry heavy loads from the Durham Iron Works, featured high sides and a shallow draft, and could be poled across the river.<ref>Fischer, p. 216</ref>

The boats were operated by experienced watermen.  Most prominent among them were the men of [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]]'s [[Marblehead Regiment]], a company of experienced seamen from [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]].  These men were joined by seamen, dockworkers, and shipbuilders from Philadelphia, as well as local ferry operators and boatsmen who knew the river well.<ref>Fischer, p. 217</ref>

==Crossing==
On [[Christmas Day]], Washington ordered his army to prepare three days' food, and issued orders that every soldier be outfitted with fresh flints for their muskets.<ref name=F206>Fischer, p. 206</ref>  He was also somewhat worried by intelligence reports that the British were planning their own crossing once the Delaware was frozen over.  At 4 pm Washington's army turned out for its evening parade, where the troops were issued ammunition, and even the officers and musicians were ordered to carry [[musket]]s.  They were told that they were departing on a secret mission.<ref name=F207>Fischer, p. 207</ref>  Marching eight abreast in close formations, and ordered to be as quiet as possible, they left the camp for McKonkey's Ferry.<ref name=F208>Fischer, p. 208</ref>  Washington's plan required the crossing to begin as soon as it was dark enough to conceal their movements on the river, but most of the troops did not reach the crossing point until about 6 pm, about ninety minutes after sunset.<ref name=F210>Fischer, p. 210</ref>  The weather got progressively worse, turn from drizzle to rain to sleet and snow.  "It blew a hurricane" recalled one soldier.<ref name=F212>Fischer, p. 212</ref>

[[Image:HenryKnox.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry Knox]]]]
Washington had given charge of the crossing logistics to his chief of artillery, the portly [[Henry Knox]].  In addition to crossing the large number of troops (most of whom could not swim), he had to safely cross eighteen pieces of artillery and the horses to move them.  Knox wrote that the crossing was accomplished "with almost infinite difficulty", and that its most significant danger was "floating ice in the river".<ref name=F218>Fischer, p. 218</ref>  One observer noted that the whole operation might well have failed "but for the stentorian lungs of Colonel Knox".<ref name=F218/>

Washington was among the first of the troops to cross, going with Virginia troops led by General [[Adam Stephen]].  These troops formed a sentry line around the landing area in New Jersey, with strict instructions that no one was to pass through.  The password was "Victory or Death".<ref name=F220>Fischer, p. 220</ref>  The rest of the army crossed without significant incident, although a few men, including Delaware's Colonel [[John Haslet]] fell into the water.<ref name=F219>Fischer, p. 219</ref>

[[Image:Battle-of-Trenton.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Map showing Washington's movements leading up to the [[Battle of Trenton]]]]
The two other crossings fared less well.  The treacherous weather and [[ice jam]]s on the river stopped General Ewing from even attempting a crossing below Trenton. Colonel Cadwalader crossed a significant portion of his men to New Jersey, but when he found that he could not get his [[artillery]] across the river he recalled his men from New Jersey. When he received word about Washington's victory, he crossed his men over again but retreated when he found out that Washington had not stayed in New Jersey.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 321<U+2013>322</ref>

==Attack==
{{main|Battle of Trenton}}
As soon as the army was ready, Washington ordered it split into two columns, one under the command of himself and General Greene, the second under General Sullivan. The Sullivan column would take [[New Jersey Route 29|River Road]] from Bear Tavern to Trenton while Washington's column would follow [[New Jersey Route 31|Pennington Road]], a parallel route that lay a few miles inland from the river.  Only three Americans were killed and six wounded, while 22 Hessians were killed with 98 wounded.<ref name="Tread">Crocker, p. 59</ref> The Americans captured 1000 prisoners and seized muskets, powder, and artillery.<ref name="Tread"/><ref>McCullough, p. 281. (There were at least 1400 Hessians: 900 were captured, 500 escaped, 21 were killed, and 90 were wounded.)</ref>

==Return to Pennsylvania==
Following the battle, Washington had to execute a second crossing that was in some ways more difficult than the first.  In the aftermath of the battle, the Hessian supplies had been plundered, and, in spite of Washington's explicit orders for its destruction, casks of captured [[rum]] were opened, so some of the celebrating troops got drunk,<ref>Fischer, p. 256</ref> probably contributing to the larger number of troops that had to be pulled from the icy waters on the return crossing.<ref>Fischer, p. 257</ref>  They also had to transport the large number of prisoners across the river while keeping them under guard.  One American acting as a guard on one of the crossing observed that the Hessians, who were standing in knee-deep ice water, were "so cold that their underjaws quivered like an aspen leaf."<ref>Fischer, p. 259</ref>

==Third crossing==
[[Image:Glover-statue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]]]
{{main|Battle of the Assunpink Creek|Battle of Princeton}}
In a war council on December 27, Washington learned that all of the British and Hessian forces had withdrawn as far north as [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], something Cadwalader had learned when his militia company crossed the river that morning.  In his letter Cadwalader proposed that the British could be driven entirely from the area, magnifying the victory.  After much debate, the council decided on action, and planned a third crossing for December 29.  On December 28 it snowed, but the weather cleared that night and it became bitter cold.  As this effort involved most of the army, eight crossing points were used.  At some of them the ice had frozen two to three inches (4 to 7&nbsp;cm) thick, and was capable of supporting soldiers, who crossed the ice on foot.  At other crossings the conditions were so bad that the attempts were abandoned for the day.  It was [[New Years Eve]] before the army and all of its baggage was back in New Jersey.<ref>Fischer, pp. 265<U+2013>268</ref>  This was somewhat fortunate, as the enlistment period of John Glover's regiment (along with a significant number of others) was expiring at the end of the year, and many of these men, including most of Glover's, wanted to go home, where a lucrative [[privateer]]ing trade awaited them.<ref>Fischer, p. 270</ref>  Only by offering a bounty to be paid immediately from Congressional coffers in Philadelphia did a significant number of men agree to stay with the army another six weeks.<ref>Fischer, pp. 273<U+2013>275</ref>

Washington then adopted a fortified position just south of the [[Assunpink Creek]], across the creek from Trenton.<ref>Ketchum, p. 276</ref>  In this position he successfully [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|beat back one assault]] on January 2, 1777, which he followed up with [[Battle of Princeton|a decisive victory]] at Princeton the next day.  In the following days, the British withdrew to New Brunswick, and the Continental Army entered winter quarters in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].<ref>Ketchum, pp. 286<U+2013>322</ref>

==Legacy==
At the time of the crossing, Washington's army included a significant number of people who played important roles in the formation and early days of the [[United States of America]].  These included future President [[James Monroe]], future [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[John Marshall]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] (a future [[Secretary of the Treasury]]), and [[Arthur St. Clair]], who later served as [[President of the Continental Congress]] and Governor of the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Fischer, pp. 222<!--St. Clair-->, 223<!--Monroe-->, 339<!--Hamilton--></ref><ref>Bennett, p. 89<!--Marshall--></ref>

Both sides of the Delaware River where the crossing took place have been preserved, in an area designated as the [[Washington's Crossing]] [[National Historic Landmark]].  In this district, [[Washington Crossing Historic Park]] in [[Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania]] preserves the area in Pennsylvania, and [[Washington Crossing State Park]] marks the New Jersey side.<ref>Washington Crossing Historic Park</ref><ref>Washington Crossing State Park</ref>  The two areas are connected by the [[Washington Crossing Bridge]].<ref>Washington Crossing Toll Supported Bridge</ref>

In 1851 the artist [[Emmanuel Leutze]] created the painting called ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' (pictured above), an idealized but historically inaccurate portrayal of the crossing.<ref>Fischer, pp. 2<U+2013>5</ref>  Fictional portrayals in film of the crossing have also been made, with perhaps the most notable recent one being [[The Crossing (2000 film)|''The Crossing'']], a 2000 television movie starring [[Jeff Daniels]] as George Washington.<ref>Washington Crossing Historic Park - Frequently Asked Questions</ref>

The 19th episode of the PBS miniseries ''[[Liberty's Kids]]'', entitled "Across The Delaware", chronicles the crossing, beginning with the report and escape of Washington's spy [[John Honeyman]], and showing events up to the reenlistment of most of the Army after their supplies are restored, and a footnote is made by character Sarah Phillips of Washington's follow-up attack, where the army delayed its retreat to capture the now ill-defended British garrison at Princeton, New Jersey. The episode makes one minor historical error: footage of the Hessians' Christmas celebration depicts soldiers dancing to "[[Silent Night]]", at least forty years before the carol was written.<ref>Liberty's Kids - Across the Delaware</ref>
