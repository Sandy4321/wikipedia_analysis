<!--Per WP:BOLDTITLE and WP:CONTEXTLINK, neither the article's title nor related text appears in bold.-->A referendum on the [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|EU accession of the Republic of Croatia]] was held on 22 January 2012. [[Croatia]] finished [[wikt:accession|accession]] (membership) negotiations on 30 June 2011 and signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Treaty of Accession]] on 9 December 2011, setting it on course to become the bloc's [[Member state of the European Union|28th member state]]. The [[Constitution of Croatia]] requires that a binding referendum be held on any political union reducing national [[sovereignty]], such as via [[European Union]] membership. On 23 December 2011 the [[Croatian Parliament]] made a preliminary decision on EU accession and determined that the referendum would be held on 22 January 2012. The 2012 Croatian EU accession referendum was the first referendum held in Croatia since the [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatian independence referendum]] held more than 20 years earlier, in 1991.

The Croatian EU accession referendum campaign officially began on 3 January 2012; a yes vote was supported by both the political parties in government and the larger opposition parties in Croatia. The largest parties' joint support of EU membership existed since 2005, when the Alliance for Europe ({{lang-hr|Savez za Europu}}) was set up as an informal alliance aimed at achieving membership as a strategic goal of [[Foreign relations of Croatia|Croatian foreign policy]]. Opposition to Croatian EU accession was voiced by non-parliamentary parties only. The pro-membership and informational campaign&nbsp;<U+2013> which included television promotional videos, addresses by leading government and opposition politicians, and information booklets mailed to every household in Croatia&nbsp;<U+2013> was announced to have cost 4.8&nbsp;million [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] ({{circa}} {{<U+20AC>|640,000|link=yes}}). Opinion polling was regularly carried out by three different agencies; since May 2011, percentages supporting EU membership ranged between 55% and 63%. The Croatian State Election Committee was in charge of vote organization, ballot counting and result publication.

The EU accession referendum passed with 66.27% votes cast in support, 33.13% against the proposed joining of the EU and 0.60% invalid or blank votes; it also passed in all Croatian [[Counties of Croatia|counties]]. The greatest support for the referendum was recorded in [[Me<U+0111>imurje County|Me<U+0111>imurje]] and [[Brod-Posavina County|Brod-Posavina]] counties, at 75.73% and 72.61% respectively. The lowest support for EU accession was recorded in [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County]], where 42.22% of votes were cast against the proposal. The average official turnout for the referendum was 43.51%; the highest official turnouts were recorded in the [[Zagreb|city of Zagreb]] and in [[Vara<U+017E>din County]] at 55.13% and 53.66% respectively. The result was binding on the Croatian Parliament; as a consequence, it ratified the accession treaty on 9 March 2012. The outcome was welcomed by all political parties represented in Croatia's parliament; some right-wing politicians objected to the low turnout and what they consider a loss of independence.

==Background==
[[Croatia]] applied for [[European Union]] (EU) membership in 2003, the [[European Commission]] recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004, and the [[European Council]] granted candidate country status to Croatia in mid-2004. [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Accession negotiations]], while originally set for March 2005, began in October of that year. Croatia completed the accession negotiations on 30 June 2011; on 9 December 2011 it signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Treaty of Accession]], changing its status from a candidate to an acceding country as it prepares to become the 28th [[Member state of the European Union|EU member state]].<ref name=eu>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/824&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|title=EU closes accession negotiations with Croatia|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16106982|title=Croatia signs treaty to join EU in middle of 2013|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref> The ratification process by the Parliaments of all 27 current EU member states is expected to be concluded by the end of June 2013; therefore, Croatia's accession to the EU is expected to take place on 1 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu2011.hu/news/eu-summit-accession-treaty-croatia-be-signed-2011|title=EU Summit: Accession Treaty with Croatia to be signed in 2011|date=27 June 2011|publisher=eu2011.hu|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Vjesnik]]|language=Croatian|title=Potpisan pristupni ugovor: budu<U+0107>nost EU-a i u hrvatskim je rukama|trans_title=Accession Treaty Signed: EU Fortune is in Croatian Hands too|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=F24D43C3-8BCE-45EF-94A5-9ADAA413A225|deadurl=no|archivedate=14 June 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68Pa7dl5j|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=7 January 2012|author=Bruno Lopandi<U+0107>}}</ref> In addition to ratification by the current EU member states, Article 142 of the [[Constitution of Croatia]] requires that a binding referendum be held on [[sovereignty]] issues such as Croatian EU membership.<ref name="Ustav-RH">{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_07_85_2422.html|title=Ustav Republike Hrvatske|trans_title=Constitution of the Republic of Croatia|date=9 July 2010|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>

The [[Parliament of Croatia]] tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with referendum voting organization, ballot counting, and result publication.

The Croatian EU accession referendum campaign officially started on 3 January 2012, with a declaration that it was aimed at providing to Croatian citizens clear, concise and transparent information on the EU accession negotiations and EU membership. The campaign included television promotions and addresses by leading politicians such as: the [[President of Croatia]], [[Ivo Josipovi<U+0107>]]; the prime minister, Zoran Milanovi<U+0107>; the foreign minister, Vesna Pusi<U+0107>; other government members, such as [[Milanka Opa<U+010D>i<U+0107>]], [[Radimir <U+010C>a<U+010D>i<U+0107>]], [[Neven Mimica]] and [[<U+017D>eljko Jovanovi<U+0107>]]; and former prime minister and opposition leader [[Jadranka Kosor]]. (All of these supported the referendum in their addresses.) A telephone information hotline was also set up, and 2.15&nbsp;million EU information booklets were prepared for mailing to every household in the country. Finally, summaries of the accession treaty, negotiation documents and governmental report on the EU accession negotiations were published online, as were the original documents. It was announced that the campaign cost 4.8&nbsp;million [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] ({{circa}} {{<U+20AC>|640,000|link=yes}}).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vesna-pusic--izadite-na-referendum-i-glasujte-za-eu/997295/|language=Croatian|title=I slu<U+017E>beno PO<U+010C>ELA KAMPANJA ZA EU!

The leading parliamentary political parties in Croatia have jointly supported EU accession since 2005, when a group called the Alliance for Europe ({{lang-hr|Savez za Europu}}) was set up as an informal alliance aimed at achieving EU membership as a strategic goal of [[Foreign relations of Croatia|Croatian foreign policy]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=index.hr|language=Croatian|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/sanader-za-jutarnji-savez-za-europu-je-strateski-cilj-a-ne-koalicija/246776.aspx|title=Sanader za Jutarnji: Savez za Europu je strate<U+0161>ki cilj a ne koalicija|trans_title=Sanader for Jutarnji {{bracket|list}}: Alliance for Europe is a strategic goal and not a coalition|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Novi list]]|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/I-Jadranka-Kosor-ce-u-vladinom-spotu-pozivati-gradane-da-glasuju-za-EU|language=Croatian|title=I Jadranka Kosor <U+0107>e u vladinom spotu pozivati gra<U+0111>ane da glasuju za EU|trans_title=Jadranka Kosor will also appeal to the citizens in a government's video to vote for the EU|date=3 January 2012|author=Irena Frlan|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> Opposition to the referendum was voiced by the [[Croatian Party of Rights dr.

==Opinion polls==
[[File:Croatian EU membership opinion polls.gif|right|thumb|2008<U+2013>2012 results of Croatian EU membership opinion polling]]

Opinion polling regarding Croatian EU membership was regularly carried out by the CRO Demoskop, [[Ipsos]] Puls and Mediana Fides agencies. Since 2008, these polls overall indicated support for Croatian EU membership; in May 2011 and after, support ranged between 55% and 63%. The highest support since 2008 was 64% in the first half of November 2010.<ref name="Globus-Nov2010">{{cite web|publisher=[[Globus (weekly)]]|url=http://globus.jutarnji.hr/hrvatska/mladi-su-najveci-euroskeptici-a-slavonci-naglo-zavoljeli-eu|language=Croatian|title=Mladi su najve<U+0107>i euroskeptici, a Slavonci naglo zavoljeli EU|trans_title=Youths are the greatest eurosceptics while Slavonians suddenly fall in love with the EU|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> The lowest level of EU membership support (between 23% and 38%) was reported on 15<U+2013>16 April 2011 in the wake of the ICTY's guilty verdict for Generals Gotovina and Marka<U+010D>.<ref name="Poll-16-Apr-2011">{{cite news|work=[[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]]|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/nakon-presude-generalima-dramaticno-pala-potpora-ulasku-u-eu.html|language=Croatian|title=Nakon presude generalima dramati<U+010D>no pala potpora ulasku u EU|trans_title=EU accession support falls dramatically after the verdict to the generals|date=16 April 2011|author=Mislav Bago|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="Poll-15-16-Apr-2011">{{cite news|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/istrazivanje-nakon-presude-gotovini--samo-23--hrvata-za-ulazak-u-eu/939458/|language=Croatian|title=Samo 23% Hrvata za ulazak u EU! <U+010C>ak 95% smatra presudu nepravednom|trans_title=Only 23% of Croats support EU accession!

In early January 2012, an NGO advocating voting against the referendum called the "Council for Croatia&nbsp;<U+2013> NO TO EU" ({{lang-hr|Vije<U+0107>e za Hrvatsku&nbsp;<U+2013> NE U EU}}) reported that they had contracted a Canadian company (one unknown to the Croatian public) called the "Business Knowledge Corporation" to conduct their own poll on the issue; they stated that with 1,942 polled, 57.2% were against the referendum while 41% declined to answer the poll question. The NGO said that the apparent gross disparity between these results and the results of all other recent polls was due to government manipulation.<ref>{{cite web|author=An.

==Results==
The EU accession referendum passed with 66.27% of votes cast in support and 33.13% against EU membership for Croatia. There were 0.6% blank or invalid votes. Even though all Croatian citizens were voting in a single constituency for the referendum's purposes, the State Election Committee published the results by individual [[Counties of Croatia|counties]], cities, and municipalities. The referendum passed in all Croatian counties. The greatest support for the referendum was recorded in [[Me<U+0111>imurje County|Me<U+0111>imurje]] and [[Brod-Posavina County|Brod-Posavina]] counties at 75.73% and 72.61% respectively. The lowest support for the EU accession was recorded in [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County]], where 42.22% votes were cast against the proposal. The [[Croatian diaspora]] voted 83.13% in support.<ref name="SEC-results"/> Only 18 out of 556 [[Cities of Croatia|cities]] or [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]] in Croatia voted against the referendum proposal. Of those, six are in [[Split-Dalmatia County]], four in [[Koprivnica-Kri<U+017E>evci County]], two in [[Zagreb County|Zagreb]] and Dubrovnik-Neretva counties each, and a single municipality in [[Istria County|Istria]], [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County|Primorje-Gorski Kotar]], [[<U+0160>ibenik-Knin County|<U+0160>ibenik-Knin]] and [[Zadar County|Zadar]] counties each.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/analiza-kako-je-glasovala-hrvatska-protiv-eu-bilo-18-opcina-clanak-368801|language=Croatian|title=Analiza kako je glasovala Hrvatska&nbsp;<U+2013> protiv EU bilo 18 op<U+0107>ina|trans_title=Analysis of Croatia's vote&nbsp;<U+2013> 18 municipalities voted against the EU|author=Tomislav Krasnec|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

The average turnout at the referendum was 43.51%. The figure includes the voters living abroad, whose turnout was only 3.51%; they comprise more than 9% of the total Croatian electorate. The highest turnouts were recorded in the city of Zagreb and in [[Vara<U+017E>din County]], at 55.13% and 53.66% respectively, while the lowest turnout in Croatia was recorded in [[Lika-Senj County]] at just 34.52%.<ref name="SEC-results"/> There is no turnout threshold for a referendum to be legally valid.<ref name="CC-Const"/>

The low turnout was attributed in part to poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation was supported by the [[Demographics of Croatia|2011 census]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Croatian|url=http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/161294/Default.aspx|title=Referendum <U+0107>e nadzirati samo zagovornici Unije|trans_title=The referendum only monitored by proponents of the Union|author=<U+0160>enol Selimovi<U+0107>|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/popis-stanovnistva-u-hrvatskoj-otkrio--pola-milijuna-biraca-je-visak-/956206/|title=Popis stanovni<U+0161>tva u Hrvatskoj otkrio: Pola milijuna bira<U+010D>a je vi<U+0161>ak!|trans_title=Croatian census reveals: A half million voters extra!|author=Nikola Sever <U+0160>eni|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would otherwise have exceeded 50%.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=t-portal|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/172125/Agresivna-kampanja-izazvala-je-kontraefekt.html|title=Agresivna kampanja izazvala je kontraefekt|language=Croatian|trans_title=Aggressive campaign backfires|date=23 January 2012|author=Vlatka Pol<U+0161>ak Palatinu<U+0161>|accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/stvarno-stanje-u-hrvatskoj-je-glasalo-61-a-ne-43-5-posto-gradana-clanak-369127|title=Stvarno stanje: U Hrvatskoj je glasalo 61, a ne 43,5 posto gra<U+0111>ana|language=Croatian|trans_title=Actual situation: In Croatia 61 percent voted and not 43.5 percent|authors=M. <U+0160>poljar, A.

After the result's announcement, President Josipovi<U+0107> commented that the day was of great significance to Croatia, defining the nation as one with a European future. Prime Minister Milanovi<U+0107> welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone; he also said that the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia.

He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new [[Yugoslavia]], saying that "only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed".<ref name=VidovSimac/>

On the other side, the HSP president [[Daniel Srb]] argued that the referendum was illegitimate since 71% of Croatian voters had not taken part in the referendum or had voted against the entry of Croatia into the EU, and warned that only 28% of Croatian voters had supported joining the EU.
