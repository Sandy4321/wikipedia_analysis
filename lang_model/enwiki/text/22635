==Building history== 

There is evidence of a church within Spennithorne in Anglo-Saxon times, as well as existence by the time of the Norman Conquest. By the mid 12th century, St Michael and All Angel<U+2019>s Church had been built and enlarged. The existing church tower dates back to around the 14th century when the aisles were also widened to their current width, along with the channel being rebuilt and extended eastwards to it's present length with the vestry being added on the north side. The structure of the church now resembles a medieval building of which majority remains in the 21st century. In the 1970's and 1980's Spennithorne church features in the BBC series "All Creatures Great and Small". <ref>{{cite web|title=Spennithorne: St Michael, Lyburn|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/spennithorne-st-michael/|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>
