'''Herm<U+00E9>tica''' was an Argentine [[thrash metal]] band from [[San Mart<U+00ED>n, Buenos Aires]]. It was formed by bassist [[Ricardo Iorio]] in 1987 after his previous band [[V8 (band)|V8]] disbanded. Herm<U+00E9>tica was signed to the independent record label Radio Tr<U+00ED>poli Discos throughout their career. The band's initial lineup consisted of Iorio, vocalist [[Claudio O'Connor]], drummer Fabi<U+00E1>n Spataro and guitarist [[Antonio Romano]]. Spataro left the band in 1988 and was replaced by Antonio Scotto. This lineup recorded their [[eponym]]ous [[Herm<U+00E9>tica (album)|album]], the first thrash metal album recorded in Argentina. At this point of their career, Herm<U+00E9>tica performed mainly in Argentina, except for one concert held in Uruguay. In 1990, they released ''[[Int<U+00E9>rpretes]]''{{mdash}}an extended play which included covers of [[Argentine rock]] and [[Argentine tango|tango]] songs. Both albums were released by Radio Tr<U+00ED>poli Discos as a single CD when digital technology became available.

Scotto left the band in 1991 and was replaced by drummer [[Claudio Strunz]]. This lineup recorded the band's second studio album, ''[[<U+00C1>cido Argentino]]''. Herm<U+00E9>tica opened for [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Motorhead]] during their visits to Argentina, but had to cancel their headlining tour in Paraguay. They recorded a live album, ''[[En vivo 1993 Argentina]]'', and took part in a concert at a penal facility. They participated in the first Argentine [[Monsters of Rock]] festival, which featured Black Sabbath, [[Slayer]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. Their last studio album, ''[[V<U+00ED>ctimas del Vaciamiento]]'', was released in 1994. To promote the album, the group held a concert at the [[Obras Sanitarias]] stadium later that year.

Herm<U+00E9>tica disbanded at the end of 1994, a few days before their second concert in Obras. Ricardo Iorio, who performed lead vocals on a number of tracks, formed a new band [[Almafuerte (band)|Almafuerte]] and served as its vocalist. The remaining ex-members of Herm<U+00E9>tica hired a new bassist and created the band [[Mal<U+00F3>n (band)|Mal<U+00F3>n]]. Both bands began a mutual rivalry after their respective establishment.

==History==

===Early years and ''Herm<U+00E9>tica'' (1987<U+2013>1989)===
[[Ricardo Iorio]] was the frontman and bassist of the band [[V8 (band)|V8]], which broke up in 1987. After its disbandment, Iorio formed Herm<U+00E9>tica, which had a similar  musical style to V8. Initially, he tried to work with Mart<U+00ED>n Knye, a former member of [[Kamikaze (band)|Kamikaze]], but after two meetings, the idea was abandoned. Iorio then appointed the guitarist Antonio Romano from the band Cerbero, who had been previously considered for V8. Iorio wanted Romano to be both a vocalist and bassist, but his manager Marcelo Tommy persuaded Iorio to hire someone else.<ref name="mad57">{{cite interview |last= Iorio|first= Ricardo|subjectlink= Ricardo Iorio|interviewer= C<U+00E9>sar Fuentes Rodr<U+00ED>guez|title= Cr<U+00E1>neo Candente|program= [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] N<U+00BA> 57|year= 1995|month= September|pages= 10-11}}</ref> Iorio eventually chose [[Claudio O'Connor]] for vocals and Fabi<U+00E1>n Spataro from the band Mark as drummer. They began to practice at [[Villa Ballester]] in 1987. The name of the band is a reference to [[hermeticism]]; Iorio saw similarities between the hermetic doctrine and the context of the Argentine heavy metal.<ref>Blumetti, p. 2</ref>

The first songs composed by Iorio were "Sepulcro Civil", "Masa Anestesiada", and "Cr<U+00E1>neo Candente". The band's first show was in a pub called "Helloween" in [[San Mart<U+00ED>n, Buenos Aires|San Mart<U+00ED>n]], on May 7, 1988. Although [[Horcas]] had been established before Herm<U+00E9>tica by [[Osvaldo Civile]]{{mdash}}a fellow member of V8{{mdash}}Herm<U+00E9>tica was the first of the two bands to perform a live concert. Spataro left the band in 1988 because of a labor dispute. He was replaced by drummer Tony Scotto, who was introduced by friends of the band. He performed his first concert with the band in August at the "S<U+00E1>enz Pe<U+00F1>a" club{{mdash}}where Spataro played for the last time. The fanzine ''Zote'' organized a free concert at the main plaza of [[Lomas de Zamora]], but it was canceled because of the failed military uprising of the [[Carapintadas|Carapintadas insurgents]].<ref>Blumetti, pp.&nbsp;2<U+2013>3</ref>

Herm<U+00E9>tica made regular appearances at the Arlequines theater in [[San Telmo, Buenos Aires|San Telmo]] in 1989. They were the first heavy metal band to play there. They performed with the bands Doppler, 666, Militia, Genocidio, Ultraje, Cross, Legi<U+00F3>n, and Devastaci<U+00F3>n. Herm<U+00E9>tica wanted to record their first album but the national economic crisis had a negative impact on the project. The fanzine "Rebellion Rock" proposed an [[Independent music|independent production]], which would be sold at [[Parque Centenario]], but the band rejected this offer. They also rejected working for [[EMI]] and instead signed for a new label, [[Radio Tr<U+00ED>poli Discos]]. They signed a  contract in May 1989, and two months later the band began to record the LP at the Sonovisi<U+00F3>n studios. The eponymous album [[Herm<U+00E9>tica (album)|Herm<U+00E9>tica]] was released in November 1989. It was the first [[thrash metal]] album to be recorded in Argentina. Ricardo Iorio made his debut as lead vocalist on the song "Desde el Oeste". Herm<U+00E9>tica performed a concert in [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], with the band Hammer. [[Alberto Zamarbide]], a former singer with V8, made a guest appearance during a concert in [[Mataderos]]. Herm<U+00E9>tica ended the year by performing two concerts with [[Pappo]]'s new band Pappo & The Widowmakers.<ref>Blumetti, pp.&nbsp;3<U+2013>4</ref>

===''Int<U+00E9>rpretes'' and ''<U+00C1>cido Argentino'' (1990<U+2013>1992)===
[[File:Cemento Estados Unidos 1200 BSAS.jpg|thumb|left|Herm<U+00E9>tica performed many concerts at [[Cemento]].]]

Herm<U+00E9>tica performed their only concert outside of Argentina in the early 1990s at the "Club Platense" in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. They played with Retrosat<U+00E1>n and Alvacast,{{mdash}}two bands from Uruguay. Herm<U+00E9>tica had to spend the night in the street because of the faulty Uruguayan production. Once they returned to Argentina, they performed at several locations in Buenos Aires and in Mar del Plata with Divididos, Los Violadores, Ar<U+00E1>cnido and Rata Blanca. They were offered a chance to record an EP with only 27 hours of recording time. They accepted the proposal, and recorded improvised [[cover versions]] of songs by V8, [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], [[Enrique Santos Disc<U+00E9>polo]], [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]], and [[Manal]]. Iorio, a fan of a band called [[Budgie (band)|Budgie]], made deliberate similarities to [[Metallica]]'s cover EP, ''[[The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited]]''{{mdash}}which included a cover version of a song by that band. Herm<U+00E9>tica performed at the "Metal en acci<U+00F3>n" festival at the [[Estadio Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani|Jos<U+00E9> Amalfitani stadium]], sharing the bill with 2112, Lethal, Horcas, Kamikaze, Alakran, and [[Riff (Argentine band)|Riff]].<ref>Blumetti, pp.&nbsp;4<U+2013>5</ref>

The band searchd for a new concert venue because the Arlequines was becoming too small for their growing audience. They moved to [[Cemento]], where most of the 1991 concerts took place. They played with the bands Todos tus muertos, Pobres pibes, Nepal, Militia, Devastaci<U+00F3>n, Rapier, and Resistencia Nativa. Their albums ''Herm<U+00E9>tica'' and ''Int<U+00E9>rpretes''{{mdash}}which had been released as [[LP record]]s and [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], were released by Tripoli on a single [[compact disc]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Iorio|first= Ricardo|subjectlink= Ricardo Iorio|interviewer= Frank Blumetti|title= La biblia junto al calef<U+00F3>n|program= [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] N<U+00BA> 10|year= 1991|month= January|pages= 2-4}}</ref> Tony Scotto left the band because of creative differences and was replaced by [[Claudio Strunz]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Iorio|first= Ricardo|subjectlink= Ricardo Iorio|interviewer= Carlos Parise|title= <U+00BF>Un argentino <U+00E1>cido?|program= [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] N<U+00BA> 16|year= 1991|month= October|pages= 16-17}}</ref> Strunz, drummer of the band Heinkel and owner of Herm<U+00E9>tica's rehearsal room, had already played with the band during practice sessions when Scotto was absent. He made his debut at [[Sunchales, Santa Fe|Sunchales]]. The band appeared in two television programs, ''[[La movida del '90]]'' and ''[[Siglo XX Cambalache]]'' and recorded their second full-length album, ''[[<U+00C1>cido Argentino]]'', with 150 hours of recording time at the Aguilar studios. It was released at Cemento on December 27.<ref>Blumetti, p. 5</ref>

Following an avalanche at [[San Carlos Minas]] in January 1992, Herm<U+00E9>tica joined a charity music festival held at the [[Estadio Chateau Carreras|Chateau Carreras stadium]]. Herm<U+00E9>tica played only a few songs at a concert with Riff{{mdash}}the headline band{{mdash}}, which ended with minor riots. Herm<U+00E9>tica were the opening act for [[Black Sabbath]] at [[Estadio Obras Sanitarias|Obras Sanitarias]]; Black Sabbath's frontman [[Ronnie James Dio]] thanked the band for playing with them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Rodr<U+00ED>guez|first1= C<U+00E9>sar Fuentes|last2= Blumetti|first2= Frank|date=July 1992|title= Los <U+00ED>dolos eternos|trans_title= The eternal idols|journal= [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] |issue= 23|pages= 13<U+2013>14|location= Buenos Aires |publisher= Editorial Llamoso |language= Spanish}}</ref> The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to [[Daniel Grinbank]], the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath.<ref name="RNS4">{{cite interview |last= Iorio|first= Ricardo|subjectlink= Ricardo Iorio|interviewer= David Cufr<U+00E9>|title= Sin Vaselina|program= Rock N' Shows Magazine N<U+00BA> 4|year= 1994|month= March|pages= 4-7}}</ref> In October 1992, they were the supporting band for Mot<U+00F6>rhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, but once in the country the show's producers tried to pay less money than had been agreed.

===Live albums and ''V<U+00ED>ctimas del Vaciamiento'' (1993<U+2013>1994)===
Herm<U+00E9>tica toured [[Patagonia]] at the beginning of 1993. In March that year, ''<U+00C1>cido Argentino'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] by the [[Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers]] (CAPIF), having shipped 30,000 copies in Argentina.<ref name="B67" /> Tripoli invited them to produce a new studio album in Miami or Los <U+00C1>ngeles but the band refused, preferring to stay in Argentina.<ref name="metals93">{{cite interview |last= Iorio|first= Ricardo|interviewer= [[Metal (magazine)|Metal]]|title= Ni v<U+00ED>ctimas ni cambio|date= September 1993}}</ref> Herm<U+00E9>tica was scheduled to support [[Megadeth]], but their guitarist/vocalist [[Dave Mustaine]] had health problems which forced the band to cancel the concert.<ref name="B67" /> They received proposals to play with Metallica, but rejected the required terms of the contract.<ref name="RNS4"/> After touring in Rosario and Greater Buenos Aires, Herm<U+00E9>tica performed their first concert in Buenos Aires on May 15, 1993, at Stadium, a new concert hall with a capacity of 5,000.<ref name="B67" /> They recorded the live album ''[[En vivo 1993 Argentina]]'' and a home video. The album included a heavy metal [[cover version]] of "Si se calla el cantor", a song first recorded by folk singer [[Jos<U+00E9> Larralde]]. This album ended the contract with Radio Tr<U+00ED>poli, which was renewed. Herm<U+00E9>tica performed at the Olmos penal facility on August 17, along with Lethal, A.N.I.M.A.L., Massacre, Attaque 77, Pilsen and the British [[UK Subs]]. The concert was presented by the radio host [[Norberto Verea]], and was recorded and released on a live CD named "[[Radio Olmos]]".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1578685|title= Diez conciertos en la c<U+00E1>rcel|trans_title= Ten concerts in prison|language= Spanish|author= Nicol<U+00E1>s Igarz<U+00E1>bal|date= May 3, 2013|work= |publisher= Rolling Stone|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> The band performed another concert at Stadium on September 4, and began to produce their third studio album.<ref name="B67">Blumetti, pp.&nbsp;6<U+2013>7</ref>

Herm<U+00E9>tica was part of the 1994 edition of the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Buenos Aires, alongside Black Sabbath, [[Slayer]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Blumetti|first1= Frank|year= 1994|title= [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]]|issue= 45|pages= 11<U+2013>13}}</ref> Shortly after, they released their third studio album, ''[[V<U+00ED>ctimas del Vaciamiento]]''. As the Stadium's hall was not big enough to accommodate the audience, they held a concert at Estadio Obras Sanitarias. Herm<U+00E9>tica recorded their performance and released it as a live album titled ''[[Lo <U+00FA>ltimo]]''. Meanwhile, their newest studio album received gold certification. The band recorded a cover version of a folk song, "De los pagos del tiempo", also by Larralde.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Feijoo|first1= Sebasti<U+00E1>n|year= 1994|title= [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]]|issue= 48|pages= 34}}</ref> The band had received proposals to play at Obras the previous year, which the accepted with the condition that they would organize it  themselves.<ref name="metals93"/>

Herm<U+00E9>tica's last concert was held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had contracted [[hepatitis B]] turned out to be false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Herm<U+00E9>tica, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the ''[[Clar<U+00ED>n (Argentine newspaper)|Clar<U+00ED>n]]'' newspaper and the other members to the music magazine ''[[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]]''. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not talking to each other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in ''Madhouse'' magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band.<ref name="Madhouse49">{{cite interview |subject= Mal<U+00F3>n|subjectlink= Mal<U+00F3>n (band)|interviewer= Gustavo Olmedo / Frank Blumetti|title= Madhouse 49|year=1995|month=February|pages=9-10}}</ref>

The concert in Obras was filmed and released as a live album. The first edition was released under the name ''Lo <U+00DA>ltimo'' with a black front-cover; it was edited in studio to match the quality of a regular studio CD. It was later reissued as a double album titled "En Concierto"; this version was not edited in the studio and reinstated the raw sound of the band's live performance.

Ricardo Iorio started a new band, [[Almafuerte (band)|Almafuerte]], with guitarist [[Claudio Marciello]] and drummer [[Claudio Cardacci]]. Iorio took lead vocal duties and included covers of Herm<U+00E9>tica and V8 songs in his new band's repertoire.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Rodr<U+00ED>guez| first1 = C<U+00E9>sar Fuentes|date=April 1995 | title = Por la misma senda| trans_title = Through the same path| journal = [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] | issue = 51| pages = 51| location = Buenos Aires | publisher = Editorial Llamoso | language = Spanish}}</ref> O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz hired a new bassist, [[Karlos Cuadrado]], and formed the band [[Mal<U+00F3>n (band)|Mal<U+00F3>n]].<ref name="Madhouse49"/> The bands became rivals; Herm<U+00E9>tica's popularity was inherited by both bands. A 1995 poll among readers of ''Madhouse'' was led by members or works of both bands in all national categories.<ref>{{cite journal|date=February 1996 | title = Gran Encuesta Madhouse 1995| trans_title = Big Madhouse poll 19995| journal = [[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] | issue = 62| pages = 23<U+2013>24| location = Buenos Aires | publisher = Editorial Llamoso | language = Spanish}}</ref>

Herm<U+00E9>tica remained a popular band in the Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who had never seen the band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Mal<U+00F3>n, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it and that they would not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1433294-malon-vuelve-hermetica-aun-no|title= Mal<U+00F3>n vuelve; Herm<U+00E9>tica&nbsp;... a<U+00FA>n no|trans_title= Mal<U+00F3>n returns; Herm<U+00E9>tica&nbsp;... not yet|language= Spanish|author= Sebasti<U+00E1>n Esposito|date= December 17, 2011|work= |publisher= La Naci<U+00F3>n|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref>

==Style and lyrics==
Herm<U+00E9>tica was a thrash metal band, drawing influences from Mot<U+00F6>rhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their music was composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a [[counterpoint]] between the singing styles of their two vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were high pitched, while Iorio had a raucous style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety.<ref name="victimas">{{cite journal|last1=Rodr<U+00ED>guez|first1=C<U+00E9>sar Fuentes|date=May 1994|title= Herm<U+00E9>tica: V<U+00ED>ctimas del vaciamiento|journal=[[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]]|issue=41|pages=36<U+2013>37|location=Buenos Aires|publisher=Editorial Llamoso|language=Spanish}}</ref> Iorio thought that his singing style in Herm<U+00E9>tica was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs had not been composed specifically for him.<ref name="mad57"/> The success of Herm<U+00E9>tica's second studio album ''<U+00C1>cido Argentino'' allowed the band to increase the budget for the production of its follow-up, ''V<U+00ED>ctimas del Vaciamiento''. Iorio proposed re-recording the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal.<ref name="mad44">{{cite interview|last=Iorio|first=Ricardo|subjectlink=Ricardo Iorio|interviewer= C<U+00E9>sar Fuentes Rodr<U+00ED>guez|title= "El Heavy metal es el verdadero movimiento del Rock"|program=[[Madhouse (magazine)|Madhouse]] N<U+00BA> 44|date=September 1994|pages=4-5}}</ref>

The musical style of Herm<U+00E9>tica was considered to be "old-fashioned". The band achieved success as a result of their introspective lyrics.<ref name="victimas" /> Unlike most heavy metal bands, Herm<U+00E9>tica's music was appealing to poor people. Iorio wrote about his thoughts and concerns from a personal perspective.<ref>Blumetti, p. 1</ref> He stated that some of his lyrics were inspired by 1940s [[Argentine tango]] music.<ref name="mad44" /> Herm<U+00E9>tica was part of the ''Rock chab<U+00F3>n'' movement within [[Argentine rock]]; their music was influenced by [[Argentine nationalism]], family values and neighbourhood-centered [[Localism (politics)|localism]].<ref>Hern<U+00E1>ndez, p. 278</ref> Iorio said that he does not support racism or fascism.<ref name="mad57" /> The lyrics, except for covers, were always written in Spanish because Iorio does not approve of artists who write in English to gain foreign audience.<ref name="metals93"/> The first two albums addressed a variety of topics; the track "Memoria de siglos" ("Memory of centuries") references the [[cult of personality]], [[buck passing]], [[peace through strength]], and [[wage slavery]]. Each song from their third album is devoted to a different subject.<ref name="mad44" />
