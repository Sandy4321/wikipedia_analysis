'''Andrei Pavlovich Kirilenko''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041F><U+0430><U+0432><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041A><U+0438><U+0440><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E>}}) ({{OldStyleDate|8 November|1906|26 August}} in [[Alexeyevka, Belgorod Oblast|Alexeyevka]], [[Belgorod Oblast]], [[Russian Empire]] <U+2013> 12 May 1990 in [[Moscow|Moscow, Russian SFSR]]) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[Russian people|Russian]] statesman from the start to the end of the [[Cold War]]. He served as an organisational secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) from [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s ouster to the death of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. Kirilenko was responsible for personnel selection and detailed supervision of the economic planning of the CPSU during the [[Brezhnev Era]]. Brezhnev appointed [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in 1976 to be his "counterweight" in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC). He became a [[List of members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1960s|member of the Political Bureau]] (Politburo) in 1965. He was forced to resign from active politics due health reasons, but also due to [[Yuri Andropov]]'s appointment to the General Secretaryship.

Kirilenko was born in the city of Alexeyevka in 1906 to a Russian [[working class]] family. He graduated in the 1920s, and again, in the early 1930s. He became a member of the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] in 1930. As many like him Kirilenko climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the 'industrial ladder'; by the 1960s he was Vice-Chairman of the [[Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSFSR]]. After Khrushchev's forced resignation Kirilenko became Brezhnev's "chief lieutenant" within the Central Committee. His main objective was to ensure Brezhnev's power base, and if he could, strenghten Brezhnev's position within the Party. When Andropov became General Secretary in 1982 Kirilenko was pushed aside. He died on 12 May 1990.

==Early life and careeer==
Kirilenko was born on 8 September 1906 in the village of [[Alexeyevka, Belgorod Oblast|Alexeyevka]], [[Belgorod Oblast]], [[Russian Empire]] to a [[working class]] family. As a young boy Kirilenko worked as an [[electrician]] and a [[locksmith]].<ref>Law 1975, p. 226.</ref> In 1920 Kirilenko graduated from one of the local schools, five years later he graduated from the Alekseevskii vocational technical school. In the mid-to-late 1920s Kirilenko started working for a mining [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprise]] located in the [[Voronezh Oblast]]. He became an active member of [[Komsomol]] in 1929, and two years later in 1931, he became a member of the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]]. In 1936 Kirilenko graduated from the [[Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute]]. He started working as a [[design engineer]] for the aircraft factory, [[Zaporizhia Engine Plant]]. In 1938 he started focusing on party politics and was eventually selected to the position of Second Secretary of the Voroshilov District Party Committee in [[Zaporozhye Oblast]], he became First Secretary the following year. Later that same year he was appoined to Second Secretary of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Party Committee of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. In this role, he made significant contributions to the development of [[Metallurgical engineering|metallurgical]] and [[electrical engineering]], but also other sorts of industry.<ref name="warheroes">{{cite web | author =  | title = <U+041A><U+0438><U+0440><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E>, <U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041F><U+0430><U+0432><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> | language = Russian | publisher = warheroes.ru | url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=12478 | accessdate = 20 November 2010 | date = }}</ref>

From the very start Kirilenko was directly involved with evacuating industry to safe zones during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]). From 1941 to 1943 he was a member of the [[Military Council of the 18th Army of the Southern Front]]. He contributed by improving discipline among soldiers as well as improving the material support for the troops. In 1943 he started to work in [[Moscow]], during his stay there the production of advanced aircraft increased rapidly. By the end of the war, in 1944, Kirilenko was made First Secretary of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Party. He suceeded [[Leonid Brezhnev]], future [[Soviet leader]], as First Secretary of the [[Dnepropetrovsk]] Regional Party Committee. From 1955 to 1962 Kirilenko was First Secretary of the [[Sverdlovsk]] Regional Party Committee;<ref name="warheroes"/> he was appointed by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] himself who later appointed him to take charge of [[Planned economy|economic planning]] and personnal selection in urban areas in the [[Russian SFSR]]. Kirilenko was later promoted to Vice-Chairman of the [[Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSFSR]]. Brezhnev benefited from Kirilenko's position, seeing his position was of vial importance for the RSFSR, Brezhnev used Kirilenko to win supported for his conspiracy against Khrushchev.<ref>Hough 1997, p. 87.</ref>

==Brezhnev era==
Immediately after Khrushchev's ouster a "[[collective leadership]]" had been formed between Brezhnev as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]], [[Alexei Kosygin]] as [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|head of government]] and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] (replaced in 1965 by [[Nikolai Podgorny]]) as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|head of state]] but also Central Commitee Secretaries [[Mikhail Suslov]] and Kirilenko.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Sandle, Mark; Bacon, Edwin | title = Brezhnev Reconsidered | location = | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 2002 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=fPZPP6Jv58sC&dq | page = 13 | isbn = 033379463X }}</ref> Kirilenko became a voting [[List of members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|member of the Political Bureau]] (Politburo) in 1965.<ref>Law 1975, p. 227.</ref> In 1966 the Bureau of the Central Commitee of the RSFSR was abolished and Kirilenko became Brezhnev's chief lieutenant. [[Vadim Medvedev]], a Soviet official, said Kirilenko was concerned with maintaining and strengthning Brezhnev's position within [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Party]].<ref>Hough 1997, p. 87<U+2013>8.</ref> Men who were loyal to Brezhnev were most of the time loyal to Kirilenko too. [[Konstantin Chernenko]], another old Brezhnev [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]], became a "counterweight" to Kirilenko's power within the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC).<ref>Hough 1997, p. 88.</ref> Before Chernenko's rise in the Soviet hierarchy Kirilenko provided detailed supervision of new party personnel and the economy, when Chernenko came on board in 1976, Kirilenko supervised the economy. By the mid-to-late 1970s Kirilenko's health was beginning to fail, and his [[memory]] weakened.<ref>Hough 1997, p. 84.</ref> Kirilenko was still however a high-standing member, and he usually presided over the meetings of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secretariat]] when Suslo was not around.<ref name="warheroes"/> Kirilenko was often treated by [[First World]] representatives as the [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party|Second Secretary]] because of organisational management of the party which had been associated with that office before Brezhnev came to power. It should be noted that Kirilenko was never Second Secretary but Suslov was.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Laird, Robert Frederick; Hoffmann, Erik P. | title = Soviet foreign policy in a changing world | location = | publisher = [[Transaction Publishers]] | year = 1989 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=1TDa1YNhSjgC&dq | page = 156 | isbn = 0202241661 }}</ref>

In 1977 Kirilenko led the Soviet delegation to the December 1977 [[MPLA]] party congress. It was at this congress that MPLA officially subscribed to the doctrine of [[Marxist-Leninism]]. This congress was of great importance to the [[Soviet Union]], and Kirilenko compared [[Angola]]'s development with that of [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Light, Margot; [[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]] | title = Troubled friendships: Moscow's Third World ventures | location = | publisher = British Academic Press | year = 1993 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QhFZHRpQdu4C&dq | page = 55<U+2013>6 | isbn = 1850436495 }}</ref> Kirilenko, along with Premier Kosygin, had been one of the most vocal opponents to a [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet intervention]] in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. Kirilenko blamed [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|the Afghan Party leadership]] for the rebellion against them, claiming that the Soviets "gave them everything". He further noticed how the Afghan leadership found it okay to executive [[civilians]] because [[Vladimir Lenin]] did so too.<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Odd Arne Westad|Westad, Odd Arne]] | title = The global Cold War: third world interventions and the making of our times | location = | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2005 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QhFZHRpQdu4C&dq | page = 316 | isbn = 0521853648 }}</ref> During Brezhnev's later rule [[KGB]] chairman [[Yuri Andropov]] gradually took over the functions, and eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership.<ref>Hough 1997, p. 90.</ref> Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev in 1982 as Soviet leader. After Brezhnev's death Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by Andropov, the new General Secretary.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = Soviet Leadership Expected to Choose a President | location = | work = [[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]] | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uxJJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lwUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1233,1960101&dq=andrei-kirilenko&hl=en | date = 13 June 1983 }}</ref> With his health deteriorating, having a disease known as [[arteriosclerosis]], Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks.<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Manuel Castells|Castells, Manuel]] | title = End of Millennium: The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture | location = | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2010 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QhFZHRpQdu4C&dq | page = 48 | volume = 3 | isbn = 1405196882 }}</ref> After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to the point where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members.
