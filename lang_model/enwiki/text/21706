The '''Moscow Canal''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041A><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430>&#769;<U+043B> <U+0438>&#769;<U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+0432><U+044B>&#769;}}), named the '''Moscow-Volga Canal''' until the year 1947, is a [[canal]] that connects the [[Moskva River]] with the [[Volga River]].  It is located in [[Moscow]] itself and in the [[Moscow Oblast]].  The canal connects to the Moskva River 191 kilometers from its [[estuary]] in [[Tushino]] (an area in the north-west of Moscow), and to the Volga River in the [[town]] of [[Dubna]], just upstream of the [[dam]] of the [[Ivankovo Reservoir]]. Length of the canal is 128&nbsp;km.

It was constructed from the year 1932 to the year 1937<ref>Maunch, C Zeller, T (2008) Rivers in History: Perspectives on Waterways in Europe and North America, University of Pittsburgh Press P73</ref> by [[Gulag]] [[prison]]ers during the early to mid [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] era, under the direction of [[Matvei Berman]]. During the process about 22,000 prisoners died<ref>[[Willi M<U+00FC>nzenberg]]</ref>

Thanks to the Moscow Canal, Moscow has access to five seas: the [[White Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], [[Sea of Azov]], and the [[Black Sea]]. This is why Moscow is sometimes called the ''"port of the five seas"'' ({{lang|ru|<U+043F><U+043E><U+0440><U+0442> <U+043F><U+044F><U+0442><U+0438> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439>}}).  Apart from transportation the canal also provides for about half of Moscow's [[water]] consumption, and the [[shore]]s of its numerous reservoirs are used as [[recreation]] zones.

One of the world's tallest statues of [[Vladimir Lenin]], {{convert|25|m|sp=us|adj=on}} high, built in 1937, is located at Dubna at the [[confluence]] of the [[Volga River]] and the Moscow Canal. The accompanying statue of [[Joseph Stalin]] of similar size was demolished in 1963 during the period of [[de-stalinization]].{{cn|date=December 2013}}
