'''Cyclone Gonu''' ([[India Meteorological Department|IMD]] designation: '''ARB 01''', [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|JTWC]] designation: '''02A''', also known as '''Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu''') is the strongest [[tropical cyclone]] on record in the [[Arabian Sea]], and is also the [[List of most intense tropical cyclones#North Indian Ocean|strongest named cyclone]] in the northern Indian Ocean.<ref name="jtwcbt">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Northern Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone Best Track Data: Cyclone Gonu|accessdate=May 27, 2008|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/2007/2007s-bio/bio022007.txt}}</ref> The second named tropical cyclone of the [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]], Gonu developed from a persistent area of [[convection]] in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1. With a favorable upper-level environment and warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] to attain peak winds of 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph) on June 3, to the [[India Meteorological Department]]. Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the eastern-most tip of [[Oman]], becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It then turned northward into the [[Gulf of Oman]], and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern [[Iran]].

Intense tropical cyclones like Gonu are extremely rare over the Arabian Sea, since most storms in this area tend to be small and dissipate quickly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=14288|title=NASA Earth Observatory: Tropical Cyclone Gonu|date=June 4, 2007|accessdate=June 5, 2007|publisher=NASA}}</ref> The cyclone caused 50&nbsp;deaths and about $4.2&nbsp;billion in damage (2007&nbsp;USD) in Oman, where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610&nbsp;mm (24&nbsp;inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28&nbsp;deaths and ${{Formatprice|216000000}} in damage (2007&nbsp;USD).

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Gonu 2007 track.png}}
Toward the end of May&nbsp;2007, the [[monsoon trough]] spawned a [[low pressure area]] in the eastern [[Arabian Sea]].<ref name="imd"/> By May&nbsp;31, an organized tropical disturbance was located about 645&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;mi) south of [[Mumbai]], India, with cyclonic [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorm activity, and a well-defined mid-level circulation. The disturbance initially lacked a distinct low-level circulation; instead it consisted of strong [[tropical cyclone#Physical structure|divergence]] along the western end of a surface [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure.<ref>{{cite web|author=Delta Forecast Team|date=May 31, 2007|title=May 31 Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the North Indian Ocean|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PKajUuuL}}</ref> A favorable upper-level environment allowed convection to improve,<ref>{{cite web|author=Charlie Forecast Team|date=June 1, 2007|title=June 1 Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the North Indian Ocean|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PKajUuuL}}</ref> and by late on June&nbsp;1, the system developed to the extent that the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) classified it as a depression.<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|date=June 2, 2007|title=June 2 Tropical Weather Outlook|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PKZlyZuA}}</ref> It tracked westward along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over southern India. Convection continued to organize, and early on June&nbsp;2 the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) classified it Tropical Cyclone 02A about 685&nbsp;km (425&nbsp;mi) southwest of Mumbai.<ref name="warn1">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 2, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone 02A Warning NR 001|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PI4P6577}}</ref>

Upon first forming, the system contended with the [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrainment]] of dry air to the northwest of the storm, which was expected to limit intensification.<ref name="warn1"/> The storm steadily intensified, and early on June&nbsp;2 the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status.<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|date=June 2, 2007|title=Deep Depression over East Central Arabian Sea|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PI3E1mSw}}</ref> Later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu about 760&nbsp;km (470&nbsp;mi) southwest of Mumbai, India.<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|date=June 2, 2007|title=Cyclone Storm "GONU" over East Central Arabian Sea|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PIRtXOfN}}</ref> As a mid-latitude trough developed over Pakistan, Gonu turned to the north and northeast,<ref name="warn4">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 2, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 004|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PJM7tPiw}}</ref> though it resumed a westward track after ridging built to the north of the storm.<ref name="warn5">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 3, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 005|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PJgtZuxr}}</ref> With a solid area of intense convection, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] to attain severe cyclonic status early on June 3,<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|date=June 3, 2007|title=Severe Cyclone Storm "GONU" over East Central Arabian Sea|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PJM7lt7l}}</ref> and with good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.<ref name="warn6">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 3, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 006|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PK57ccI9}}</ref> The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated.

After the storm maintained peak winds for about six hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June&nbsp;4.<ref name="imd"/> Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name="warn12">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 5, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 012|accessdate=June 4, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PMOutn5z}}</ref> Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and over a period of 24&nbsp;hours the intensity decreased by 95&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph).<ref name="disc15">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 5, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 015|accessdate=June 5, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PNXV1Qvn}}</ref> According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the eastern-most tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June&nbsp;6.<ref name="imd"/> Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.<ref name="warn16">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=June 6, 2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 016|accessdate=June 5, 2007|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PNsshR8D}}</ref>

In Oman, production of [[desalination|desalinated water]] was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of [[natural gas]], halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000&nbsp;residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, as the two plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region.<ref name="ap610">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=Associated Press|date=June 10, 2007|title=Cyclone Gonu causes water shortages in Oman|accessdate=June 10, 2007|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,280052,00.html}}</ref> Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces.

Cyclone Gonu set several intensity records.
