'''South America''' is a [[continent]]<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9379155 South America]". ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''. 2006.  Chicago: Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc.</ref><ref>"[http://www.answers.com/topic/South_America#Encyclopedia South America]". ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia|The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', 6th ed. 2003. New York: [[Columbia University Press]].
</ref> situated entirely in the [[Western Hemisphere|western hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]], bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest.

As part of the [[Americas]] like North America, South America is named after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a [[New World]] unknown to Europeans. 

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 [[Square metre#Square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (6,890,000 [[square mile|sq mi]]), or almost 3.5% of the [[Earth]]'s surface. As of [[2005]], its [[population]] was estimated at more than 371,000,000. South America ranks fourth in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America).

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of South America}}
South America comprises the major southern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the [[New World]], the [[Western Hemisphere]], [[Americas|the Americas]], or simply America (which is sometimes considered a single continent); it is south and east of the [[Panama Canal]], which transects the [[Isthmus of Panama]].  Geologically, almost all of mainland South America sits on the [[South American Plate]].  [[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], all of [[Panama]] <U+2013> including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus <U+2013> is often considered a part of North America alone and among the [[Central America#Human geography|countries of Central America]].

Geologically, the continent became attached to North America only recently with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama hypothetically some 3 million years ago, which resulted in the [[Great American Interchange]]. The [[Andes]], likewise a comparatively young and seismically restless mountain range, run down the western edge of the continent; the land to the east of the Andes is largely [[tropical rainforest]], the vast [[Amazon River]] basin. The continent also contains drier regions such as [[Patagonia]] and the extremely arid [[Atacama Desert]].

The South American continent also includes various [[island]]s, many of which belong to countries on the continent.  Many of the islands of the [[Caribbean|Caribbean (or West Indies)]] <U+2013> e.g., the Leeward and [[Lesser Antilles]] <U+2013> sit atop the [[Caribbean Plate]], a tectonic plate with a diffuse topography.  The islands of [[Aruba]], [[Barbados]], [[Trinidad]], and [[Tobago]] sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]].  The [[Netherlands Antilles]] and the [[federal dependencies of Venezuela]] lie along the northerly South American.  Geopolitically, the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America. [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&Rootmap=&Mode=d&SubMode=w] [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&Rootmap=&Mode=d&SubMode=w] [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas]  The South American nations that border the Caribbean Sea &ndash; including [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]] &ndash; are also known as [[Caribbean South America]]. 

South America is home to the world's highest waterfall, [[Angel Falls]] in Venezuela, the largest river (by volume), the [[Amazon River]], the longest mountain range, the [[Andes]], the driest desert, [[Atacama Desert]], the largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]], the highest railroad, Ticlio [[Peru]], the highest capital city, [[La Paz, Bolivia]], the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, [[Lake Titicaca]], and the world's southernmost town, [[Puerto Toro]], [[Chile]].

South America's major natural resources are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron]] ore, [[tin]], and [[petroleum|oil]]. The many resources of South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The inevitable fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often also causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify their production to drive them away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.

South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicuna]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the [[Earth]]'s [[species]].

The largest country in South America by far, in both area and population, is [[Brazil]], followed by [[Argentina]]. Regions in South America include the [[Andean States]], the [[Guiana]]s, the [[Southern Cone]], and [[Brazil]].

==History==
{{main|History of South America}}

===The rise of agriculture and domestication of animals===
[[Image:Alpacas_Sillustani_(pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|230px|right|A pair of [[alpacas]] near an Inca burial site in Peru]]   
South America is thought to have been first inhabited by people crossing the [[Bering Land Bridge]], which is now the [[Bering Strait]]. The first evidence for the existence of agricultural practices in South America dates back to circa 6500 BCE, when [[potatoes]], [[chillies]] and [[beans]] began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a staple foodstuff today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BCE<ref>O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25</ref>.  

By 2000 BCE many agrarian village communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast which helped to establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society<ref>O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25</ref>. 

South American cultures began domesticating [[llamas]], [[vicu<U+00F1>as]], [[guanacos]], and [[alpacas]] in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BCE. Besides their use as sources of meat, and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods (maximum load for a llama is typically 40 kg). <ref>O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25</ref>.

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===
The rise of agriculture and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.  [[Image:Sacsayhuaman (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|180px|left|The Inca stronghold of [[Sacsayhuam<U+00E1>n]]]] The [[Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now modern Colombia. They established a confederation of many clans, or cacicazgos, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.

The earliest known South American civilization was at [[Norte Chico]], in the [[littoral]] of central [[Peru]]; though a preceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Chavin culture|Chav<U+00ED>n]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chav<U+00ED>n de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chav<U+00ED>n civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

Other main cultures: [[Valdivia]] (Ecuador), [[Moche]] (100 BC - 700 AC, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Tiuahuanaco]] or Tiwanaku (100 BC - 1200 BC, Bolivia), Paracas - [[Nazca]] (400 BC - 800 AC, Peru), Wari or [[Huari]] Empire (600 - 1200, Central and northern Peru), [[Chimu]] Empire (1300 - 1470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas]], Aymaran kingdoms (1000 - 1450, Bolivia and southern Peru) and others

Holding their capital at the city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from [[1438]] to [[1533]]. Known as ''Tawantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions," in [[Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork in Inca civilization. Nevertheless, the Inca never discovered the [[wheel]], and there is no evidence that they utilized written language as a form of communication.

===European colonization===
In [[1494]], Portugal and Spain, the two great maritime powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.
[[Image:Am<U+00E9>riqueM<U+00E9>ridionaleaugment<U+00E9>.JPG|220px|right|thumb|Map of South America. (1750) Geograph: Robert de Vaugondy.]] The Treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league]]s west of [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46<U+00B0> 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (which is now known to comprehend most of the South American soil), would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

Beginning in the [[1530s]], the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from [[Spain]] and later from [[Portugal]]. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.

European infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance, and systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mita]], decimated the native population under Spanish control. After this, African [[Slavery|slave]]s, who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

The Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to Christianity, and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end. However, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended Catholicism with traditional idolatry and their polytheistic beliefs. Furthermore, the Spaniards did impose their language to the degree they did their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Guaran<U+00ED> language|Guaran<U+00ED>]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.

Eventually the [[native Americans (Americas)|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. Essentially all of the mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Indian mothers and Spanish fathers. Mestizos and the Indian natives were often forced to pay extraordinary taxes to the Spanish government and were punished harshly for disobeying their laws. Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers. This included the many gold and silver sculptures and artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal.

===Independence===
The Spanish colonies won their independence between 1804 and 1824 in the [[South American Wars of Independence]]. [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] of Venezuela and [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] of Argentina led the independence struggle. Bol<U+00ED>var led a great army southward while San Mart<U+00ED>n led an army across the Andes Mountains, meeting up with General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] in Chile, and marched northward. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where they cornered the royal army of Spain and forced its surrender.

In Brazil, a Portuguese colony, [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom Jo<U+00E3>o VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in [[1822]] and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[War of the Triple Alliance]] and the [[War of the Pacific]].

A few countries did not gain independence until the [[20th century]]:
*[[Guyana]], from the [[United Kingdom]], in 1966.
*[[Suriname]], from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] control, in 1975

[[French Guiana]] remains part of [[France]] as of [[2007]], and hosts the [[European Space Agency]]'s principal [[spaceport]], the [[Centre Spatial Guyanais]].

===Recent history===
[[Image:Leblon and Ipanema.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rio de Janeiro]] in 2006. Rio de Janeiro is the former capital of [[Brazil]].]]

The continent, like many others, became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]]. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Cold War]] doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]] (see [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the [[1980s]] a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Nonetheless, allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have developed crises which forced the resignation of their presidents, although in general normal civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early [[21st century]].

In the first decade of the 21st century, South American governments have drifted to the political left, with [[socialist]] leaders being elected in [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and leftist presidents in [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Uruguay]]. Despite the tendency to move to the left of the political spectrum, most of South America's governments are in practical terms societies embracing free-market [[capitalism]].

With the founding of the [[South American Community of Nations]], South America would intend to start down the road of economic integration, with plans for [[European Union]]-style political integration in the non-distant future.

==Economy==
[[Image:Saopaulo copan.jpg|thumb|200px|[[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The financial center of  [[Latin America]], and also the fifth biggest city in the world by metropolitan area (see [[List of metropolitan areas by population]]), after [[New York City]] in fourth, [[Mexico City]] in third, [[Seoul]] in second, and [[Tokyo]] in first.]]

{{main|Economy of South America}}
[[As of 2002]], South America's unemployment rate was 10.8 %.

Due to histories of high inflation in nearly all South American countries, interest-rates and thus investment remain high and low, respectively. Interest rates are usually twice that of the United States. For example, interest-rates are about 22 % in Venezuela and 23 % in Suriname. The exception is Chile, which has been successfully implementing free market economic policies since the 1980s and increased its social spending since the return of democratic rule in the early 1990s. This has led to economic stability and interest rates in the low single digits.

The [[South American Community of Nations]] is a planned continent-wide [[free trade zone]] to unite two existing [[free-trade]] organizations&mdash;[[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]].

The economic gap between the rich and poor in most South American nations is considered to be larger than in most other continents.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In [[Venezuela]], [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]] and many other South American countries, the richest 20 % may own over 60 % of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 20 % may own less than 5 %. This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie next to skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments.

==Culture and Language==
{{main|Culture of South America}}
[[Roman Catholicism]] is the dominant religion of the region as a whole; however [[Protestantism]] is growing steadily. Guyana and Suriname have significant [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities. [[Jewish]] communities are found across South America; the largest are in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Brazil]] and [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Also there is a significant community in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. There are significant numbers of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches founded by immigrants from the [[Middle East]].

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most widespread language of the continent, as Spanish is the official language of most South American nations. However, the majority of South Americans (51%) speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the official language of Brazil. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of [[Suriname]]; [[English language|English]] the official language of [[Guyana]]; and [[French language|French]] the official language of [[French Guiana]].

Other languages used by many South Americans are:
*[[Aymar<U+00E1>]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]].
*[[Quechua]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], and parts of [[Colombia]].
*[[Guarani language|Guaran<U+00ED>]] in [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]].
*[[Hindi language|Hindi]] in [[Suriname]].
*[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] in [[Suriname]].
*[[Italian language|Italian]] in  [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. 
*[[German language|German]] in certain pockets in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], and [[Paraguay]].
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]] remains spoken and written in the historic towns of [[Trelew]] and [[Rawson]] in recently settled parts of [[Patagonia]], Argentina.
*[[Mapudungun]], in parts of Chile and certain pockets of Argentina.
* Small cluster groups of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers in Brazil, [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]. 
* [[Arabic]] speakers, often of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian]] descent in Arab communities of Brazil and Argentina.

In some countries the continent's upper classes and well-educated people study English and French. There are small [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speaking areas of Southernmost Brazil, due to the proximity of [[Uruguay]]. South Americans are culturally enriched by the historic connection with Europe, especially [[Spain]] and "[[pop culture]]" impact from North America. ([[the U.S.]]).    

South American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include [[cumbia]] from [[Colombia]], [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] from [[Brazil]], and [[tango music|tango]] from [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canci<U+00F3>n]] movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America in various forms. People on the [[Peru]]vian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed race) of South American rhythms such as the [[Zamacueca]] (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular [[Creole Valse]] or [[Peruvian Valse]] and the soulful Arequipan [[Yaravi]]

In the late 20th century, [[Rock en espa<U+00F1>ol]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. However, this music genre has grown to include [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]] which has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other [[Music of Brazil|music genres]].  

Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, South American cuisine takes on African, American Indian, Asian and European influences. [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]], is especially well-known for its West African-influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans and Uruguayans regularly consume wine, while Argentina along with [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and people in southern [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]] enjoy a sip of [[Mate]] a regional gourd cultivated for its drink. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapevine produced in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]], however, there is a recurring dispute between those countries regarding its origins.

[[Image:Urarina_shaman_B_Dean.jpg|thumb|right|Urarina [[shaman]], 1988]]

==Peoples==
Ethnic groups and indigenous peoples of South America include:

*[[Alacalufe]]

Descendents of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Quechua]] and [[Aymara]], make up the majority of the population in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], and are a significant element in most other former [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. At least three of the Amerindian languages ([[Quechua]] in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in [[Bolivia]], and [[Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]]) are recognized along with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as national languages.

===Usage===
Among people in some [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, there is a tendency to confuse the linguistic and geographic divisions of the Americas: thus, [[Mexico]], some [[Central America]]n and [[Caribbean]] territories, despite their location in North America, are mistakenly included in South America. The term [[Latin America]] is correctly used when referring to those territories whose official or national languages come from [[Latin]] (namely [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]]). Conversely, [[Anglo-America]] is used to refer to areas whose major languages are [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] (namely [[English language|English]]) such as [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Belize]], [[Jamaica]], and much of the [[West Indies]]. Similarly, areas where English is prominent are considered part of the [[Anglosphere]].
