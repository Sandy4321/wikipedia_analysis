'''Gennady Ivanovich Yanayev''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+0301><U+0434><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+0301><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+042F><U+043D><U+0430><U+0301><U+0435><U+0432>}}; 26 August 1937 &ndash; 24 September 2010) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[Russian people|Russian]] politician and statesman whose career spanned the rules of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]], [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko|Chernenko]], and culminated during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] years. Yanayev was born in [[Perevoz, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Perevoz, Gorky Oblast]]. After years in local politics, he rose to prominence as Chairman of the [[All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions]], but he also held other lesser posts such as deputy of the [[Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries]].

Due to his chairmanship of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions he gained a seat in the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. During the 1990 July plenum he was elected to the [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee]]. Later that year, with the help of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Yanayev was elected as [[Vice President of the Soviet Union]]. Having growing doubts of where Gorbachev's reforms were leading, Yanayev started working with, and eventually leading, the [[Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)|Gang of Eight]], the group which deposed Gorbachev during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|August coup of 1991]]. After three days the [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]] collapsed due to the popularity of [[Boris Yeltsin]], but during its brief grip on power Yanayev was made Acting [[President of the Soviet Union]]. He was then arrested for his role in the coup, but in 1994 he was [[Pardon|pardoned]] by the [[State Duma]]. He spent the rest of his life working in Russian tourism administration until his death on 24&nbsp;September 2010.

==Early life and career==
Yanayev was born on 26&nbsp;August 1937 in the town of [[Perevoz, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Perevoz, Gorky Oblast]] during the height of [[Stalinist]] repression in the Soviet Union.<ref name="born"/> He graduated from the [[Gorky Institute of Agriculture]] in 1959.

==Vice President==
{{seealso|1991 Soviet coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)}}
On 27 December 1990, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] proposed Yanayev for the Vice Presidency of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]. Yanayev had initially been rejected by the Soviet parliament, but he was finally approved due to Gorbachev's reluctance to replace him with another candidate. Because of Yanayev's more [[conservative]] views, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] resigned from office to protest against the increasing numbers of conservatives in top political offices.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Raymond L.

However, after gaining the attention of the [[Soviet government]], the unionists withdrew their plans for a strike.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sovjetunionen: gruvearbeidere trekker plan om streik  | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | author = | date = 3 March 1991 | page = | language = Norwegian | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref>

===August Coup===
After the [[Soviet government]] announced their proposal for a New Union Treaty to form the [[Union of Sovereign States]], as a reorganization of the [[Soviet Union]] into a new confederation, Gorbachev immediately went on vacation to his [[dacha]] in the [[Crimea]]. Believing that this new union treaty would lead to the disintegration of the USSR, the [[State Committee of the State of Emergency]] placed Gorbachev under [[house arrest]] on 19&nbsp;August, one day before the treaty was due to be signed. On that same day the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) issued the coup plotters' [[decree]], which stated: "Owing to the conditions of his health, Mikhail Gorbachev is no longer capable of carrying on the duties of the [[President of the USSR]]. In accordance with article 127, clause 7 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution|USSR constitution]], Vice President Gennady Yanayev has assumed the duties of the President of the USSR." The decree made references to the growing problems facing the country such as ethnic tensions, political confrontations and chaos, which according to the coup leaders threatened the very existence of [[Soviet society|Soviet life]] and the territorial integrity of the USSR.<ref>{{cite book | author = Neimanis, George J. | title = The Collapse of the Soviet Empire: A View from Riga | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | year = 1997 | location = Westport, Connecticut | page = 76 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=nlLSpT9J_yMC&dq | isbn = 0<U+2013>2759<U+2013>5713<U+2013>6 }}</ref> Yanayev further claimed that threat to collapse was close, and if the economic situation was not handle quickly, the Soviet Union would collapse. In addition, Yanayev and the rest of the state committee ordered the [[Cabinet of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Cabinet of Ministers]] to alter the then current [[Five-Year Plan of the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]] to relieve the housing shortage. All city-dwellers were given one third of an acre each to combant the winter shortages with.<ref name="PBS"/>

When asked about Gorbachev, Yanayev replied "Let me say that Mikhail Gorbachev is now on vacation. He is undergoing treatment, himself, in our country. He is very tired after these many years and he will need some time to get better."<ref name="PBS">{{cite news |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/russia/1991/russ_8-19.html |title=Russian Reaction |publisher=[[PBS NewsHour]] |date=19 August 1991|accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> In another note Yanayev told the country that Gorbachev was absent due to bad health, and that he was "undergoing treatment, himself, in our country. He is very tired after these many years and he will need some time to get better." At the press conference Yanayev's hands were shaking rather violently, leading many journalists to focus on Yanayev's apparent [[drunkenness]] instead of Gorbachev's allegedly bad health.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8060046/Gennady-Yanayev.html |title=Gennady Yanayev |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 October 2010|accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref> In an interview from 2008, Yanayev said he regretted making himself [[acting (law)|acting]] President, further claiming that he was pressured by the more conservative members to sign the documents which declared his own presidency. He described the events of 1991 as a burden for the rest of his life.<ref name="born"/> Yanayev has also admitted to being drunk when he signed the decree which made him acting President.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-09-24-russia-yanayev-obit_N.htm |title=Soviet coup plotter Gennady Yanayev dies at 73|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=24 September 2010|accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref>

On 19 August, citizens of Moscow gathered around Russia's [[White House, Moscow|White House]] and began to erect barricades around it, in which at 16:00 Yanayev responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] in Moscow.<ref name="two">{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.nr2.ru/projects/79717.html | title = <U+0422><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043A><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438> | language = Russian | publisher = nr2.ru | date = 18 August 2006 | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = | url = http://souz.info/library/other/gkchp/gkchppost.htm#post1 | title = <U+0413><U+043E><U+0441><U+0443><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0447><U+0440><U+0435><U+0437><U+0432><U+044B><U+0447><U+0430><U+0439><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C><U+0443> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0436><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044E> <U+0432> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420> | language = Russian | publisher = souz.info | date = | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref> Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 that Gorbachev was "resting". He said: "Over these years he has gotten very tired and needs some time to get his health back." Yanayev said the Emergency Committee was committed to continuing his reforms. However, Yanayev's weak posture, trembling hands and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing.<ref name="two"/> According to some historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee but was not its mastermind; [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] has been described as the "heart and soul of the conspiracy". Yanayev only agreed to head the Emergency Committee on 20&nbsp;August. Along with the other coup leaders, Yanayev was dismissed as Vice President and later [[jailed]] for his crimes against the [[Soviet state]].<ref name="BBC-Obit" />

==Later life and death==
Three years after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Yanayev was freed by an amnesty of the Russian [[State Duma]] in 1994.<ref name="BBC-Obit">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11405117|title=Soviet coup leader Gennady Yanayev dies|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> He would eventually become the head of the Department of History and International Relations of the [[Russian International Academy of Tourism]].<ref name="born">{{cite news | author = Schwirz, Michael | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/world/europe/25yanayev.html | title = Gennadi I.

When interviewed during his stay, Yanayev said that "The disease literally eats up the lungs". His doctors eventually reached the conclusion that [[chemotherapy]] would be the right course to save his life but also the most difficult one. They acknowledged that he was in poor health and that there was little guarantee of his survival.
