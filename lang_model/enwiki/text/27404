Bromfield's academic program includes core courses in mathematics, English, social studies, and science, as well as music, world languages, physical education and fine and applied arts. Students in grades 9<U+2013>12 fulfill graduation requirements in these core courses and may also take advantage of [[Advanced Placement]] courses. The school is known for excellent academics, sending most graduates on to four-year higher-learning institutions, many of which rank with great prestige.  

The Bromfield School also has celebrated athletic teams, especially in soccer and girls cross country/track. The boys varsity soccer team was crowned Division III state champion in 2005 and 2007, and the girls varsity soccer team was a Division III state finalist in 2007, while the girls cross country team has been ranked by Nike as the 17th best team in the nation, winning the division II state championship the last three years and in 2002. The women's track and field program has had outstanding recognition at the state and national levels, winning the Div. 4 Indoor State Championship in 2001 and each of the last three years along with the All-State Championships in both 2002 and 2003, the girls outdoor track team has won the Central Mass all division Championship each of the last four years and has been the All-State runner-up the past two years..  Graduates include Olympian [[Lynn Jennings]], current standout and All-American, Arianna Lambie of [[Stanford]].

[http://www.harvardtheatre.org/mcgartym/bds.html The Bromfield Drama Society]has also made a name for itself by reaching the state finals of the [http://www.mhsdg.com Massachusetts High School Drama Guild]Festival 24 out of the last 28 years. Successful alumni include actor [[Keir O'Donnell]]. actress Sydney Brown, set designer Sue Bolles and composer [http://www.jennygiering.com Jenny Giering]. 

Many town residents disagree with the recent decision by the Harvard school committee which "extended Superintendent Thomas Jefferson's contract at a time when the school system is under investigation by the Worcester district attorney's office and the state Ethics Com mission following complaints about the district's special-education expenditures....The residents' unhappiness intensified after a year-end management report...stated that a recent review of the town's finances turned up some "questionable" expenditures in the special-education account" (Lefferts, 2007). At an October 2007 Special Town Meeting the citizens of Harvard voted 215 to 117 in favor of censuring the school committee (Town of Harvard, 2007). 

Under his leadership several well-respected senior staff members have chosen to leave the system.{{fact|date=May 2008}}
