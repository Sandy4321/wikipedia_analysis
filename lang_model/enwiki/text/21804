'''Wade's Causeway''' (also known as '''Wade's Causey''',<ref name="Blanchard, p">Blanchard</ref><ref>Drake, p. 35</ref> '''Wheeldale Roman Road''',<ref>English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road main page</ref><ref>Heritage Explorer website</ref> '''Goathland Roman Road'''<ref name="scheduled_monument">English Heritage Protection List website, entry 1004876</ref> and '''Auld Wife's Trod'''<ref>Elgee, p. 138</ref><ref>Codrington, p. 165</ref>) is the name commonly given to [[Scheduled monument|scheduled ancient monument]] number 1004876
,<ref name="scheduled_monument"/> a stone structure that cuts across a section of the [[North York Moors]] national park in the parish of Egton, North Yorkshire, [[England]]. Part of the structure, on Wheeldale Moor, is well preserved, and was excavated by archaeologists in the early part of the 20th century.<ref>Engineering Timelines website</ref><ref>Heritage Explorer website</ref> The structure has historically been interpreted as road or [[causeway]] across marshy ground, probably of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, and was assigned the catalogue number 81b by Ivan Margary, a noted authority on Roman roads,<ref>Felbridge and District History Group</ref> in 1967. In the 21st century, previously accepted explanations for the structure's function and date of construction have been thrown into question, with a variety of alternative interpretations proposed. The structure was first documented in writing during the 1720s after having long been part of local folklore:

:"I was surprised when I first mett with it distant about two miles from any town or dwelling, of the common stone of the countrey, fit enough for the purpose in a black springey rotten moor which continues about six miles to near the Sinus."<ref>The Roman "Dunus Sinus", thought to be near present-day Whitby, possibly the village of Dunsley</ref>

(description of Wade's Causeway in a letter from Thomas Robinson of Pickering to Roger Gale in 1724)<ref>Stukeley, p. 307</ref>

== Etymology ==

[[Image:V<U+00F6>lund.jpg|thumb|Wayland the Smith, son of Vadi [Wade] in the ''Thidrekssaga'']]

The name "Wade's Causeway" means "the causeway belonging to Wade" or "the causeway built by Wade". A [[causeway]] is a road route across wetland, normally supported on earth or stone in the form of a raised embankment or [[agger]]. The word ''causeway'' derives from the earlier ''causey way'' or simply ''causey''. ''Causey'' derives ultimately from the Latin for heel, ''calx'', and most likely comes from the trampling technique used in the Ancient Roman era to consolidate earthworks.

The "Wade" that the causeway construction is apocryphally attributed to could be:
* [[Wade (folklore)|Wade]] (from the Old English Wada), also known as Waetla, the English name for a common Germanic mythological character
* The giant Vadi, (also known as Witege, Vathe, Vidia, Widga, Vidga, Wadi or Vade) from the Norse ''Saga of Bern'' in the ''Thidrekssaga''<ref>Wade, p. 12</ref><ref>Clarke, p. 262</ref><ref>Bjork</ref>
* Wada as a derivation of the Danish hero Wate, also called Wada<ref name="Wade, p. 30">Wade, p. 30</ref>
* Wa-te, a fierce sea-king who reigns in Sturmland in the German ''Kudrun''. His figure recalls to some extent that of the God Neptune.<ref>Houghton, p. 242</ref><ref>Clarke, p. 262</ref><ref>Chambers, p. 95</ref>
* Duke Wada, a historical Saxon duke from around the year 800, possibly named after one of the mythological figures known as Wade, and who lived in the Yorkshire area<ref name="Wade, p. 30"/>
* Any other of a number of persons named Wade in the post-Roman era that may have been locally renowned but are either little known now, or else unknown to history. The name was common in early English history<ref>Wade, p. 11</ref> and Searle records around a dozen historic persons with the name in his ''Onomasticon'' of Anglo-Saxon names.<ref>Chambers, p. 98</ref><ref>Searle, p. 471</ref>

== Dating evidence ==

In archaeological excavations, no coins or other artefacts have been found on or around the structure that would aid in its dating.<ref name="ReferenceA">English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road research page</ref> This has led to great difficulty in establishing even an approximate date for its construction, and attempts to date the structure have relied primarily on the details of its construction comparable to other structures of more precisely established date and function.

There is similarly little or no dating evidence for when the structure fell out of use or into disrepair. It was recorded in 1736 as being "not now made use of",<ref>Drake, p. 35</ref> but may have fallen out of use more than 1000 years earlier.

== Dimensions ==

The length of the exposed structure following archaeological excavations between 1912 and 1920 is approximately 1.2 miles. The structure is believed to extend far beyond its excavated portion,<ref>Darvill, p. 160</ref><ref>Mattingly, p. 137</ref><ref>Price, p. 155</ref><ref>Knapton, p. 24</ref><ref>Muir, p. 83</ref> however no other part of its conjectured course has been excavated or extensively surveyed. The original length of the structure in its entirety is therefore unknown, but may have been up to 25 miles.<ref>BBC Countryfile website</ref>

The structure is approximately 4.8 to 6.2 metres wide at its raised surface. The total width is increased by another 1 metre of cut ditch to either side of the structure, which may or may not be associated with its original construction, making for an approximately uniform total width of 6<U+2013>7 metres (17 feet).<ref>Codrington, p. 165</ref>

== Route ==

=== Extant Course ===

After some initial clearing in the 1890s,<ref>English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road main page</ref> a 1.2 mile (1.9 km) section of the structure was uncovered by archaeologists between 1912 and 1920<ref>English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road research page</ref> on the eastern extent of Wheeldale Moor in the North York Moors. It lies approximately 185<U+2013>200 metres above sea level.<ref name="ReferenceB">English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road description page</ref>

=== Possible Extended Course ===

There is no clear consensus on the route of the structure extending beyond that section already excavated.<ref>English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road main page</ref> It has been conjectured that the structure originally linked the Roman [[Cawthorne Camp]] with the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of [[Sleights]], based on reports from antiquarians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that fragments of the structure were visible at numerous points along this course. In the twentieth century English Heritage identified two sections of ground on Flamborough Rigg and Pickering Moor as extensions of the Wheeldale structure<ref name="list.english-heritage.org.uk">English Heritage Protection List website, entry 1004108</ref><ref>English Heritage Protection List website, entry 1004104</ref> and some Ordnance Survey maps therefore show projected routes for a "Roman Road (possible)" along this route. However, there is little if any modern archaeological evidence to support this possible extended course, since the suggested route has been neither excavated nor surveyed in the modern era. 

There is further conjecture on less certain evidence that the original structure's course may have stretched all the way from ''Derventio Brigantum'' (possibly modern-day [[Amotherby]] near [[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]]<ref>The Heritage Trail website</ref><ref>Price, p. 223</ref><ref>Muir, p. 83</ref>) to Roman coastal fortifications or signal stations somewhere near [[Whitby]].<ref>Darvill, p. 160</ref><ref>Mattingly, p. 137</ref><ref>Price, p. 155</ref><ref>Knapton, p. 24</ref><ref>Muir, p. 83</ref> Drake reports in 1736 that an associate had been able to trace the structure all the way to the coast at Dunsley Bay, but Codrington is dismissive of his account,<ref>Codrington, p. 166</ref> and whether the author meant to imply that the course had been visible for the entire extent is somewhat unclear.

== Construction ==

[[File:Roman road cross-sectional diagram for typical via glareata or via munita.xcf|thumb|300px|Cross-sectional diagram of a typical Roman road]]

The extant section of the structure appears to show the remains of a continuous surface metalled with closely fitted slabs of either sandstone<ref>Hayes and Rutter, pp.51-54</ref> or dolomitic limestone<ref>Knapton, p. 24</ref> with flat upper surfaces,<ref>Codrington, p. 166</ref> sitting on top of cut turf over black peat. The use of dressed stone rather than gravel as a surface dressing is sometimes held to be a sign against its being of Roman construction - the majority of Roman roads that were finished with a material other then packed earth were dressed in packed gravel or pebbles<ref>Birmingham Roman Roads Project</ref> -  and hence suggesting it must date instead either from very late in the Roman period when standards of construction were slipping, or else be of pre- or post-Roman construction.

However, there are other examples of Roman roads paved with stone blocks, including the section of the [[Via Appia]], the oldest major Roman route in Italy, in an 11 mile (17.7 km) section near [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], and Gabriel and Grant state that of the 400,000 km of known Roman roads, over 80,000 km may have been stone-paved.<ref>Gabriel, p. 9</ref><ref>Grant, p. 264</ref> The Roman writer [[Ulpian]] specifically differentiates between ''via munita'', which always had a paved stone surface, and ''via glareata'', which were earthed roads with either gravelled surfaces, or else a gravelled subsurface and paving on top.<ref>Smith, pp 946-954</ref>

Johnston and Muir both agree that an original gravel surface dressing that sat on top of the extant stone was once present on the Wheeldale structure, but whereas Johnston believes that it was washed away through weathering<ref>Johnston, p. 119</ref>, Muir states that it was primarily removed by human agents<ref>Muir, p. 83</ref>. Both agree that the stonework remaining represents the original foundation stones of the road only. The statement by Francis Drake in 1736 that at that time he found the road to be "paved with a flint pebble" may lend credibility to this theory,<ref>Drake, p. 35</ref> as does Codrington's statement that in 1817 the causeway consisted of a "strong pavement of stones placed with the flattest side uppermost, above these another stratum of gravel...".<ref>Codrington, p. 166</ref> Hayes and Rutter state that "traces of a surface layer of gravel and small stones" remained visible in the 1960s,<ref>Hayes and Rutter, pp. 53</ref> and Knapton states that there remained some evidence of smaller surface-dressing pebbles as of 1996.<ref>Knapton, p. 24</ref>

Due to the boggy nature of the ground, the structure is crossed by numerous drainage culverts with small becks and water runoff trickling through them.<ref>Johnston, p. 119</ref>

The structure's course is approximately linear over its uncovered section, albeit with numerous small bends, in contrast to often straight Roman roads.

== Condition ==

The structure has ditches on either side that run parallel to its course. There is some disagreement as to whether these are part of original structure or represent alteration of the structure in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries.

The extant uncovered section appears to have been kept relatively clear of vegetation from its excavation in the 1910s through to the 1960s, but as of 2013 was heavily covered by vegetation again.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>Heritage Trust website</ref>

The structure has also been heavily robbed of stone for use in other local construction, such as roads,<ref>Knox, p. 156</ref> dry-stone walls<ref>Codrington, p. 167</ref> and farm buildings, this robbing continuing from at least as early as 1586<ref>Camden refers to a common practice of locals "digging sand out of [the roman roads]"</ref> through to at least the early twentieth century.<ref>Home, chp. 5</ref><ref>Codrington, p. 165</ref>

English Heritage state that repair work or alterations on the structure were likely carried out on the structure sometime in the nineteenth century,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> but exact details are unclear.

There is some concern that modern visitors may also be causing some damage to the structure through wear, although the site is not heavily trafficed, visitor numbers being low, and any damage to the structure from the 1980s-1990s onwards would likely be limited by the protection gained from vegetative growth over its surface. A 2013 update by the North York Moors National Park authority suggests that weathering and grazing sheep represent the greater erosion risks.<ref>NYM NPA website</ref>

== Legendary Interpretations ==

Records of local, verbal folklore state that the structure was built by a Giant called Wade for his wife, Bell, to take her sheep to either market or pasture.<ref>BBC countryfile website</ref><ref>Codrington, p. 164</ref> The legend may be based on the historical person of the Saxon Duke ''Wada,'' recorded in 1083 as a figure dating from around 798 from the Yorkshire area, who fought against [[Eardwulf of Northumbria|King Eardwulf]] of Northumbria.<ref>Symeon</ref> However, the name could also relate to either one of a number of apocryphal Wades in Germannic, Norse and Old English folklore, or else a more modern English figure of the common Saxon and medieval surname Wade. In 1890, Bulmer records that:

:"[T]wo centuries before the Conquest, Duke Wada resided in a castle here which he had built. Tradition has preserved many stories of this Saxon princeling, but they are so interwoven with fiction, that it is impossible to pick out the bare unvarnished truth. He is represented as having been of gigantic stature... His wife, Bell, was also of enormous size, and, according to the legend, carried in her apron the stones with which her husband made the causeway that still bears his name."<ref>Bulmer</ref>

== Investigations, Surveys and Excavations ==

=== Discovery and Initial Records ===

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|150px|thumbnail|Willaim Camden, who may have made the first written reference to Wade's causeway in 1586]]

The sixteenth-century antiquarian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] passed through the area in around 1539 when compiling his ''Itineraries'' of local English history and makes mention of the nearby and mythologically-linked "Waddes Grave"<ref>Smith, p. 59</ref> - standing stones at [[Mulgrave Castle|Mulgrave]] near [[Whitby]].<ref>Chambers, p. 96</ref> However, he appears not to have had Wade's Causeway brought to his attention by local antiquarians, since he makes no mention of it. In 1586, Camden makes passing note of the fact that, in the north of England, locals take "Roman fabriks [sic] to be the work of Gyants [sic]",<ref>Camden, p. 1406</ref> which could refer either to Wade's Causeway specifically, or to folklore of the time in general.

The first modern written record that unquestionably relates to the Wheeldale structure was in 1720 by John Warburton<ref>Warburton</ref> and this was followed by debate over its function, course and history amongst local historians and antiquarians in the eighteenth century. In a private letter dating from October 1724, Thomas Robinson of [[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] states that approximately 6 miles of the structure (he describes it as a road) were visible at that time, stretching south from Dunsley village.<ref>Stukeley, p. 306</ref> For reasons that remain unclear, only an approximate 1.2 mile extent stretching north from Keys Beck remained traceable by 1811 when William Blanchard described its extent in his "History and antiquities of Scarborough and the vicinity".<ref name="Blanchard, p"/> In 1854 the same 1.2 mile extent was displayed clearly on an Ordnance Survey map.<ref>British History Online website</ref> It is this same 1.2 mile extent that remains visible to this day.

In 1855, several overgrown fragments of the structure were still visible at several points: near Morley Cross; east of Keys Beck; near Hazle houses; July Park; and Castle Hill.<ref>Knox, p. 157</ref>

=== Pre-War excavations ===


After preliminary clearing of a part of this section in the 1890s, the full 1.2 mile stretch identified above was professionally excavated between 1912 and 1920 by Mr James Patterson on behalf of the [[Office of Works]] (now the [[Department of the Environment]]).<ref>Heritage Explorer website</ref>

=== Post-War Excavations and Surveys ===


After further, minor, excavations of small sections of the causeway in 1946 and 1962,<ref>PastScape website, Investigation History page</ref> the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) undertook a [[theodolite]] survey of the causeway in 1992.<ref>Pastscape website, Investigation History page</ref> An aerial survey was also performed in 2010/2011 by Archaeological Research Services Ltd (ARS).<ref>Pastscape website, Investigation History page</ref>

=== Future Archaeological Work ===


Portico, on behalf of English Heritage, suggests four questions for future research and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use of the monument of a route or in a boundary dispute; and the possibility of carrying out analysis of the site via a detailed aerial survey, [[Lidar|LIDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging)]] or other remote sensing technique to establish the extent of the monument beyond the length that has so far been excavated.

== Interpretations of the site ==

===As a Roman causeway===


The first antiquarians to discuss the site in the eighteenth century dismissed early folkloric explanations of the structure's origins and sought to place the structure within the context of it having been a road constructed during the Roman period, most probably to connect the Roman [[Cawthorne Camp]] to the south with the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg near Grosmont to the north.  The structure does lie in a linear fashion approximately along a notional line drawn between these two sites; its width of approximately 5.1 metres (17 ft) plus 2m wide drainage channels<ref>Codrington, p. 165</ref> matches closely to the width of other Roman roads in Britain (eg [[Stanegate]] at 6.7m) as well as to the average of 7 metres (23 ft) for Roman roads internationally;<ref>Grinsell, p.255</ref> and its incorporation of many small bends is not atypical of all Roman roads (the Stanegate also has similar features).

However, one major problem for identifying the road as Roman during the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth centuries was that based on readings to that date of the ''Iter Britanniarum'' - the section of the 4th-century [[Antonine Itinerary|Itinerary of Antoninus]] that lists major Roman Roads and stations within Britain - there had never been any major Roman roads in the area in which the Wheeldale structure lies. In 1817, the Reverend George Young attempted to address this problem by arguing that the course of one of the identified ''iters'' (''iter'' 1) had been misinterpreted and did in fact run between Malton and Dunsley, passing through Wheeldale.<ref>Young, p. 717</ref> Such an argument was possible because the ''Iter Britanniarum'' was not a map, but rather a list or itinerary of roads and their distance between various settlements. Since the Roman names for settlements were used in the document, and many of these named sites had not been conclusively matched to nineteenth-century settlements, identification of exact routes listed in the ''Iter'' was often difficult.

For much of the twentieth century, the consensus view remained that the road was most probably Roman. In 1964 this was still a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument,<ref>Hayes and Rutter, pp.51-54</ref> and in 1967 Ivan Margary, the leading authority on Roman roads at the time, accepted it as such as gave it the catalogue number 81b in his list of Roman roads in Britan.<ref>Margary</ref> Several works from the 1980s/1990s still state that this is the most likely explanation of the structure.<ref>Muir, p. 83</ref><ref>Price, p. 223</ref>

===As a pre-Roman or medieval road===


However, archaeological work between 1999 and 2013 has cast some doubt on this narrative, since the structure does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network and there are some discrepancies of construction from what can be seen of the remains compared to known Roman roads. Specifically, the structure appears to have a surface dressing of stone flags rather than the gravel typically used on Roman roads.<ref>Dalesman website</ref> Additionally, detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site has failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor.<ref>Pastscape website, Detailed Result</ref> It has therefore been suggested that the structure may be a road dating from either the pre-Roman or post-Roman ([[medieval]]) periods.<ref>PastScape website, Detailed Result page</ref><ref>English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road significance page</ref> There are other issues with the interpretation of the structure as being a road, including the fact that several burial cists along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> which would have been highly unusal for a road.

===As a Neolithic boundary structure===


Since 1997, there has been some doubt has been cast by authorities including the structure's managers, English Heritage, as to whether the structure is actually a road or causeway at all .<ref name="english-heritage.org.uk">English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road history page</ref> Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner has stated that the structure may actually be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a Neolithic or Bronze Age boundary wall or dyke.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>British Archaeology: Letters</ref> There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including other boundary dikes,<ref>Oswald, pp. 2-3</ref> though none whose extant structure is so substantial. To account for the relative uncertainty regarding the structure's original function, the term "Wheeldale Linear Monument" was introduced in the 2010s to refer to the structure, whatever its origin.<ref name="english-heritage.org.uk"/> English Heritage in 2013 stated that the balance of opinion had swung to favour a prehistoric, rather than Roman, origin for the structure.<ref name="english-heritage.org.uk"/>

As of 2013, the uncertainty regarding the monument's purpose and origin is reflected by the information board at the end of the extant section of structure where it meets the modern road. The original sign, pictured in 1991<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wheeldale_Moor_Roman_Road_-_geograph.org.uk_-_646937.jpg</ref> states that the structure is a Roman road, whereas its 2013 equivalent admits that the origin and purpose of the structure are unknown.

== Tourism ==

The site is now managed by the North York Moors National Park Authority, in cooperation with English Heritage,<ref>English Heritage website, Wheeldale Roman Road main page</ref> through a Local Management Agreement. The site is not heavily promoted. English Heritage do not man the site and permit free access at any reasonable time. Visitor numbers are generally very low.

==In Popular Culture==

Scottish Author [[Michael Scott Rohan]] drew on the legend of Wade's Causeway, as well as wider English, Germannic and Norse mythology, when he wrote his [[Winter of the World]] trilogy while residing in Yorkshire. The books feature mention of a legendary giant, Vayde, who built a causeway across the marshes. It bore his name, Vayde's causeway.
