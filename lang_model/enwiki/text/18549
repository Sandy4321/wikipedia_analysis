'''''Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band''''' is [[Ringo Starr]]'s first official live album, recorded in [[1989]] during his successful comeback tour and released in [[1990]].  It was also Starr's first release of unheard material for seven years.

== The Album ==
After taking a hiatus from his solo career following [[1983]]'s ''[[Old Wave]]'', Starr spent the next few years making TV appearances and guesting on other artists' recordings and gigs, as well as recording an album that would remain unissued.  In [[1988]], however, he and wife [[Barbara Bach]] accepted that they both were suffering from [[alcoholism]] and took steps to rehabilitate themselves.  Once Starr was sober, he felt the need to work again.  Before delving into an album, he wanted to hit the road first - but with a difference.  Always one to include friends, Starr concocted the All-Starr Band, an ever-changing live line-up of famous musicians that would back Starr up, in addition to each performing a song or two themselves.  

Booking himself on the road from July to September 1989, Starr was accompanied by [[Dr. John]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Billy Preston]], [[The Band]]'s [[Levon Helm]] and [[Rick Danko]], [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Clarence Clemons]] and renowned session drummer [[Jim Keltner]].  The shows were often sold out and were well-received, although Starr's thunder was stolen by [[Paul McCartney]]'s concurrent first US tour in thirteen years for ''[[Flowers in the Dirt]]''.  However, demand was so high for Starr & Co. that they would end up playing [[Japan]] before McCartney that same fall.  After several years of laying fallow, Ringo Starr was doing what he loved best and was clearly all the happier for it.  The performance contained here was effected on the closing night of the US tour at the Greek Theatre in [[Los Angeles]].

''Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band'' was released through [[EMI]] in the fall of 1990 (Starr's first association with his first label since [[1975]]).  In the US however, [[Rykodisc]] assumed the distribution of the album.  Failing to chart, the release would ultimately be deleted some years later. In the first edition, is included a bonus CD with alternative songs.
