'''Nintendo Entertainment System''', or '''NES''', is an [[8-bit]] [[video game console]] released by [[Nintendo]] in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. Its [[Japan|Japanese]] equivalent is known as the 
{{nihongo|'''Nintendo Family Computer'''|<U+4EFB><U+5929><U+5802> <U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30DF><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30B3><U+30F3><U+30D4><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+30BF>|}}, or {{nihongo|'''Famicom'''|<U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30DF><U+30B3><U+30F3>}}. The most successful gaming console of its time in Asia and North America (Nintendo claims to have sold over 60 million NES units worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Classic Systems&mdash;Nintendo Entertainment System | work=Nintendo | url=http://www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=nes | format=http | accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>), it helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]], and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] (the first modern [[platform game]], ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', was the system<U+2019>s first "[[killer game]]") to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Nintendo Entertainment System}}
[[Image:NES Donkey Kong.png|thumb|left|200px|Success of titles like ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' at the [[video arcade]] encouraged Nintendo to enter the home console market.]]
Following a series of [[arcade game]] successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to produce its own console hardware that had removable cartridges, a feature not included with the company<U+2019>s earlier [[Color TV Game]]s product. Designed by [[Masayuki Uemura]] and released in [[Japan]] on [[July 15]], [[1983]] for [[Yen|<U+00A5>]]14,800, the '''Nintendo Family Computer''' ('''Famicom''') was slow to gather momentum: during its first year, many criticized the system as unreliable, prone to programming errors and rampant freezing. Following a [[product recall]] and a reissue with a new [[motherboard]], the Famicom<U+2019>s popularity soared, becoming the best-selling game console in Japan by the end of 1984. Encouraged by their successes, Nintendo soon turned their attentions to the North American markets. 

[[Image:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|right|200px|''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was one of the titles packaged alongside the NES deck for the North American launch of the console.]]
[[Nintendo]] entered into negotiations with [[Atari]] to release the Famicom under Atari<U+2019>s name as the name "Nintendo Enhanced Video System." This deal eventually fell through<ref>Atari broke off negotiations with Nintendo in response to [[Coleco|Coleco<U+2019>s]] unveiling of a unlicensed port of ''Donkey Kong'' for their [[Coleco Adam]] computer system. Although the game had been produced without Nintendo<U+2019>s permission or support, Atari took its release as a sign that Nintendo was dealing with one of their major competitors in the market.</ref>, and Atari decided to concentrate on its own next-generation 8-bit console, the [[Atari 7800]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The History of the Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom | work=Nintendo Land | url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?nes/history.htm | format=http | accessdate=February 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Subsequent plans to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard, cassette data recorder, wireless joystick controller, and a special [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] cartridge under the name "Nintendo Advanced Video System" likewise fell through. Finally, in June 1985 Nintendo unveiled its American version of the Famicom at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES). With a completely redesigned case and a new name, the Nintendo Entertainment System proved to be just as popular in America as the Famicom was in Japan, and played a major role in revitalizing interest in the video game industry. Originally Nintendo only released 50,000 units in New York City, and because of its great success it was released nationwide. Nintendo rolled out its first systems to limited American markets on October 18, 1985, following up with a nationwide release of the console in February of the following year.<ref>{{cite book | first = Van | last = Burnham | year = 2001 | title = Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971<U+2013>1984 | pages = p. 375 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | id = ISBN 0-26-252420-1 }}</ref> The console was released in two different packages: a full-featured $249 USD "Deluxe Set" which came packaged with the [[R.O.B.]], the [[NES Zapper]], two game controllers, and two games (''[[Duck Hunt]]'', and ''[[Gyromite]]''), and a scaled-down $199 "Control Deck," which omitted the R.O.B., Zapper, ''Duck Hunt'' and ''Gyromite'', but included a ''Super Mario Bros.'' GamePak. The more common "Action Set" which included a ''Super Mario Bros.''/''Duck Hunt'' [[multicart]] wasn't released until 1988.<ref name="liedholm1">{{cite web | author=Liedholm, Marcus and Mattias | title=History of the Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom | work=Nintendo Land | url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?nes/history.htm | format=http | accessdate=February 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

For the rest of the decade, Nintendo was the undisputed master of the American and Japanese gaming markets, and its game titles were breaking sales records. However, the console did not attain the same level of success in the rest of the western world. In Europe and Australia, the system was released to two separate marketing regions (A and B). Mattel handled distribution for region A, which consisted of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Italy. Distribution in region B, consisting of the rest of mainland Europe, was handled by a number of different companies, with Nintendo responsible for most cartridge releases. Not until 1990 did Nintendo's newly created European branch take over distribution throughout Europe.<ref name="europe">{{cite web | title=European information | format=http | work=[http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/ Nintendo Database] | url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/nes/nes_eu.shtml | accessdate=May 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This enabled competitor Sega to outperform the NES with its Sega Master System in many countries.

[[Image:NES_Kirbys_Adventure.png|thumb|left|200px|''[[Kirby's Adventure|Kirby<U+2019>s Adventure]]'', released in 1993, was one of the final licensed titles for the NES.]]
As the 1990s dawned, however, renewed competition from technologically superior systems such as the [[16-bit]] [[Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] (known as the Sega Genesis in North America) marked the end of the NES<U+2019>s dominance. Eclipsed by Nintendo<U+2019>s own [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), the NES<U+2019>s user base gradually waned. Nintendo continued to support the system in America through the first half of the decade, even releasing a new version of the console, the [[NES 2]], to address many of the design flaws in the original NES hardware. By 1995, though, in the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new software titles, Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES. Despite this, Nintendo of Japan kept producing new Nintendo Famicoms for a niche market up until October 2003, when Nintendo of Japan officially discontinued the line. Even as developers ceased production for the NES, a number of high-profile video game franchises and series for the NES were transitioned to newer consoles and remain popular to this day. Nintendo's own ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises began life on the NES, as did [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, [[Konami]]'s ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, and [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' franchises.

In the years following the official "death" of the NES in the west, a collector<U+2019>s market based around [[Rental shop|video rental shops]], [[garage sale]]s and [[flea market]]s led some gamers to rediscover the NES. Coupled with the growth of [[console emulation]], the late 1990s saw something of a second golden age for the NES. The secondhand market began to dry up after 2000, and finding ROMs no longer represented the challenge it had in the past. Parallel to the rise of interest in emulation was the emergence of a dedicated NES hardware [[modding|"modding" scene]]. Such hobbyists perform tasks such as moving the NES to a completely new case, or just dissecting it for parts or fun. The controllers are particular targets for modding, often being adapted to connect with [[personal computer]]s by way of a [[parallel port|parallel]] or [[USB]] port. Some NES modders have transformed the console into a [[portable]] system by adding [[AA batteries]] and an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen. 
<br style="clear: left;" />

== Regional differences ==
Although the Japanese Famicom and the international NES included essentially the same hardware, there were certain key differences between the two systems:
* ''Different case design''. The Famicom featured a top-loading cartridge slot, a 15-[[pin]] expansion port located on the unit<U+2019>s front panel for accessories (as the controllers were hard-wired to the back of the console), and a red and white color scheme. The NES featured a front-loading cartridge slot (often jokingly compared to a [[toaster]]), and a more subdued gray, black and red color scheme. An expansion port was found on the bottom of the unit, and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.
[[Image:NES Metroid.png|thumb|200px|right|In Japan, ''Metroid'' was released both in cartridge and diskette form for the Famicom Disk System.]]
* ''60-pin vs. 72-pin cartridges''. The original Famicom and the re-released [[AV Family Computer]] both utilized a 60-pin cartridge design, which resulted in slightly smaller cartridges than the NES (and the [[NES 2]]), which utilized a 72-pin design. Four pins were used for the [[10NES]] lockout chip.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hernandez, Christopher | title=Nintendo NES / Famicom | format=http | work=Dark Watcher's Console History | url=http://darkwatcher.psxfanatics.com/console/nes.htm | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ten pins were added that connected a cartridge directly to the expansion port on the bottom of the unit. Finally, two pins that allowed cartridges to provide their own sound expansion chips were removed, a regrettable decision. Many early games (such as ''StackUp'') released in North America were simply Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter (such as the [[T89 Cartridge Converter]]) to allow them to fit inside the NES hardware. Nintendo did this to reduce costs and inventory by using the same cartridge boards in America and Japan.
* A number of [[peripheral device]]s and [[Computer software|software]] packages were released in for the Famicom. Few of these devices were ever released outside of Japan.
** <span id="fds">''[[Famicom Disk System]] (FDS)''</span>. Although not included with the original system, a popular floppy disk drive peripheral was released for the Famicom in Japan only. Nintendo never released the Famicom Disk System outside of Japan, citing concerns about software bootlegging. Notable games released for the FDS include ''[[Doki Doki Panic]]'', a special edition of ''[[Metroid]]'', and the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]''.<ref>Many titles produced for the Famicom Disk System were subsequently [[porting|ported]] to cartridge format for international release. Such games include ''Doki Doki Panic'' (rebranded as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'') and [[Konami]]<U+2019>s ''[[Castlevania]]'' series. The original version of ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released for the FDS in Japan, and didn't see an international release until ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (where it was retitled ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'').</ref>
** ''[[Famicom BASIC]]'' was an implementation of BASIC for the Famicom. It allowed the user to program his or her own games. Many programmers got their first experience on programming for the console this way.
** ''Famicom MODEM'' was a [[modem]] that allowed connection to a Nintendo server which provided content such as jokes, news (mainly about Nintendo), game tips, weather reports for Japan and allowed a small number of programs to be downloaded.
[[Image:NES_Castlevania_3.png|thumb|right|200px|The NES version of ''Castlevania III'' suffered from inferior sound when compared to its Famicom counterpart.]]
* ''External [[sound chip]]s''. The Famicom had two cartridge pins that allowed cartridges to provide external sound enhancements. They were originally intended to facilitate the Famicom Disk System<U+2019>s external sound chip. These pins were removed from the cartridge port of the NES, and relocated to the bottom expansion port. As a result, individual cartridges could not make use of this functionality, and many NES [[Software localization|localizations]] suffered from inferior sound compared to their equivalent Famicom versions. ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Castlevania III: Dracula<U+2019>s Curse]]'' is a notable example of this problem.
* <span id="hardwired">''Hardwired controllers''</span>. The Famicom<U+2019>s original design includes [[hardwired]], non-removable controllers. In addition, the second controller featured an internal [[microphone]] for use with certain games. Both the controllers and the microphone were subsequently dropped from the redesigned AV Famicom in favor of the two seven-pin controller ports on the front panel used in the NES from its inception.
* ''Lockout circuitry''. The Famicom contained no lockout hardware, and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES 2) contained the [[10NES]] lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip (a process now legal with the expiration of the NES patent) would cut power to the chip, removing all effects and greatly improving the console<U+2019>s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports.<ref>{{cite web | author=Horton, Kevin | title=The Infamous Lockout Chip | format=http | work=BlueTech | url=http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/lockout/ | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> The European release of the console used a [[regional lockout]] system that prevented cartridges released in region A from being played on region B consoles, and vice versa.<ref name="europe" /> 
* ''Audio/video output''. The original Famicom featured an [[RF modulator]] plug for audio/video output, while the original NES featured both an RF modulator and [[RCA connector|RCA]] [[composite video|composite]] output cables. The AV Famicom featured only RCA composite output, and the top-loading NES featured only RF modulator output.

== Game controllers ==
The [[game controller]] used for the both the NES and Famicom featured a brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labelled "B" and "A," a "Start" button, and a "Select" button. Additionally, they utilized the cross-shaped [[D-pad]], designed by Nintendo employee [[Gunpei Yokoi]] for Nintendo [[Game & Watch]] systems, to replace the bulkier [[joystick]]s on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.

It is also possible that the Famicom/NES controllers may have been directly influenced by the controllers released with the [[Vectrex]] video game system in 1982. These controllers similarly featured a multidirectional, analog thumb pad/joystick on the left, and four horizontally arranged buttons.

[[Image:Famicom controllers.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Famicom controllers were simple in design, though they included a number of features, such as a microphone, missing from their NES counterparts.]] 
The original model Famicom featured two game controllers, both of which were hardwired to the back of the console. The second controller lacked the "Start" and "Select" buttons, but featured a small [[microphone]]. Relatively few games made use of this feature. The earliest produced Famicom units initially had squared A and B buttons. <ref>{{cite web | author=Nutt, Christian; Turner, Benjamin | year=2003 | title=Metal Storm: All About the Hardware. | format=http | work=Nintendo Famicom - 20 years of fun | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index5.shtml | accessdate=May 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed down. The NES dropped the hardwired controllers, instead featuring two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console. Also in contrast to the Famicom, the controllers included with the NES were identical to each other<U+2014>the second controller lacked the microphone that was present on the Famicom model, and possessed the same "Start" and "Select" buttons as the primary controller.

[[Image:Zapper.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Although it was supported only by a few select titles, the [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] was arguably the most popular special controller released for the NES.]]
A number of special controllers designed for use with specific games were released for the system, though very few such devices proved particularly popular. Such devices included, but were not limited to, the [[NES Zapper]] (a [[light gun]]), the [[Power Pad]], and the ill-fated [[R.O.B.]] and [[Power Glove]]. The original Famicom featured a [[DB-15]] expansion port on the front of the unit, which was used to connect most auxiliary devices. On the NES, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports on the front of the unit.

Near the end of the NES<U+2019>s lifespan, upon the release of the AV Famicom and the top-loading NES 2, the design of the game controllers was modified slightly. Though the original button layout was retained, the redesigned device abandoned the "brick" shell in favor of a "dog bone" shape reminiscent of the controllers of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In addition, the AV Famicom joined its international counterpart and dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports. However, the controllers included with the Famicom AV, despite being the "dog bone" type, had cables which were a short three feet long, as opposed to the standard six feet of NES controllers.

In recent years the original NES controller has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the system. Nintendo has mimicked the look of the controller in several recent products, from promotional merchandise to a limited edition version of the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] [[handheld game console]]. 
<br style="clear: left;" />

== Hardware design flaws ==
[[Image:NES Cleaning Kit.JPG|200px|thumb|left|The official NES Cleaning Kit was intended to address flaws in the NES design that caused cartridge connectors to be particularly susceptible to interference from dirt and dust.]]
When Nintendo released the NES in the United States, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish their product from those of competitors, and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the [[video game crash of 1983]]. One result of this philosophy was a front-loading [[ZIF|zero insertion force]] (ZIF) cartridge socket designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]]. The ZIF connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge<U+2019>s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Repeated insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out relatively quickly, and the ZIF design proved far more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. Exacerbating the problem was Nintendo<U+2019>s choice of materials; the slot connector that the cartridge was actually inserted into was made of a cheap alloy that was highly prone to corrosion. Add-on peripherals like the popular [[Game Genie]] [[cheat cartridge]] tended to further exacerbate this problem by bending the front-loading mechanism during gameplay.

Problems with the [[10NES]] lockout chip frequently resulted in the system<U+2019>s most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly. The lockout chip was quite finicky, requiring precise timing in order to permit the system to boot. Dirty, aging, and bent connectors would oftentimes disrupt the timing, resulting in the blink effect. User attempts to solve this problem ranged from blowing air onto the cartridge connectors to slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system. Blowing on the cartridge connectors was, in most cases, no better than removing and reinserting the cartridge, and tended to increase the rate of [[oxidation]] resulting in browning of the [[printed circuit board]], while slapping the side of the system after inserting the cartridge could potentially damage the console. In 1989, Nintendo released an official [[NES Cleaning Kit]] to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.

A more successful technique used to keep the contact pins properly aligned was to load the game cartridge as shallowly as possible into the NES, so that the back of the cartridge would scrape the inside of the NES as it was pushed down into place. This would often allow the game to be initialized more successfully than simply sliding the cartridge all the way in.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Aussiedongle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Some unlicensed games by [[Home Entertainment Suppliers]] [[Pty. Ltd.]] released in Australia used a dongle to circumvent the NES's lockout chip]] -->
When Nintendo released the top-loading [[NES 2]] toward the end of the NES<U+2019>s lifespan, they fixed the problem by switching to a standard card edge connector, and eliminated the lockout chip. All of the Famicom systems used standard card edge connectors, as did Nintendo<U+2019>s subsequent game consoles, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Nintendo 64]].

In response to these hardware flaws, "Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers" sprang up across the United States. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired. Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program. In practice, the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to Nintendo for the privilege.
<br style="clear: left;" />

== Third-party licensing ==
Nintendo<U+2019>s near [[monopoly]] on the home video game market left it with a degree of influence over the industry exceeding even that of Atari during its heyday in the early 1980s. Many of Nintendo<U+2019>s business practices during this period were heavily criticized, and may have played some role in the erosion of Nintendo<U+2019>s market share throughout the 1990s. Unlike Atari, who never actively courted third-party developers, and went so far as to go to court to attempt to force [[Activision]] to cease production of [[Atari 2600]] games, Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers<U+2014>strictly on Nintendo<U+2019>s terms. To this end, a 10NES authentication chip was placed in every console, and in every officially licensed cartridge. If the console<U+2019>s chip could not detect a counterpart chip inside the cartridge, the game would not be loaded.

[[Image:Nintendo Seal of Quality.png|thumb|left|155px|The [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]] (nearly identical to this new seal, except that the original said "Seal of Quality" across the bottom) was placed on every officially licensed NES cartridge released in North America, with a similar design used in Europe.]]

Nintendo combined this with a marketing campaign introducing the [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]]. Commercials featured a purple-robed wizard instructing consumers that the Nintendo Seal of Quality was the only assurance that a game was any good<U+2014>and, by implication, that any game without the Seal of Quality was bad. In reality, the seal only meant that the developer had paid the license fee; it had nothing to do with the quality of the game.

The business side of this was that game developers were now forced to pay a license fee to Nintendo, to submit to Nintendo<U+2019>s [[quality assurance]] process, to buy [[software development kit|developer kits]] from Nintendo, and to utilize Nintendo as the manufacturer for all cartridges and packaging. Nintendo tested and manufactured all games at its own facilities (either for part of the fee or for an additional cost), reserved the right to dictate pricing, censored material it believed to be unacceptable, decided how many cartridges of each game it would manufacture, and placed limits on how many titles it would permit a publisher to produce over a given time span (five per year). This last restriction led several publishers to establish or utilize [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] to circumvent Nintendo<U+2019>s policies (examples including [[Konami]]<U+2019>s subsidiary [[Ultra (company)|Ultra]], and [[Acclaim Entertainment]]<U+2019>s subsidiary [[LJN]]).

These practices were intended not only to keep developers on a short leash, but also to manipulate the market itself: in 1988, Nintendo started orchestrating intentional game shortages in order to increase consumer demand. Referred as "inventory management" by Nintendo of America public relations executive Peter Main, Nintendo would refuse to fill all retailer orders. Retailers, many of whom derived a large percentage of their profit from sales of Nintendo-based hardware and software (at one point, [[Toys "R" Us]] reported 17% of its sales and 22% of its profits were from Nintendo merchandise), could do little to stop these practices. In 1988, over 33 million NES cartridges were sold in the United States, but estimates suggest that the realistic demand was closer to 45 million. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, they were able to enforce these rules on their third-party developers. These extremely restricted production runs would end up damaging several smaller software developers: even if demand for their games was high, they could only produce as much profit as Nintendo allowed.<ref>{{cite web | author=GaZZwa | title=History of Videogames (part 2) | format=http | work=Gaming World | url=http://www.gamingw.net/articles/74 | accessdate=January 7 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

[[Image:Bible adventures.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Unlicensed games, such as Wisdom Tree<U+2019>s ''[[Bible Adventures]]'', were often released in cartridges which looked very different from typical NES game paks.]]

Several companies began producing unlicensed games, either refusing to pay the licensing fee or manufacturing their own cartridges after having been rejected by Nintendo. Most of these companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to knock out the authentication unit in the NES. [[Atari Games]] created a line of NES products under the name [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]], and took a different tack: the company obtained a description of the lockout chip from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case. Tengen then used these documents to design their ''Rabbit'' chip, which duplicated the function of the [[10NES]]. Nintendo sued Tengen for these actions, and Tengen lost because of the fraudulent use of the published patent. Tengen<U+2019>s [[antitrust]] claims against Nintendo were never finally decided.<ref>{{cite web | author=U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit | year=1992 | title=Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc. | format=http | work=Digital Law Online | url=http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm | accessdate=March 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia came in the form of a [[dongle]] that would be connected to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game<U+2019>s [[10NES]] lockout chip for authentication.

Although Nintendo<U+2019>s success at suing such companies was mixed (the case of [[Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc.]] was found in favor of Galoob and their [[Game Genie]] device, for instance), most were eventually forced out of business or out of production by legal fees and court costs for extended lawsuits brought by the giant against the transgressors. One notable exception was [[Color Dreams]], who produced [[Christian video games]] under the subsidiary name [[Wisdom Tree]]. This operation was never sued by Nintendo, who feared a [[public relations]] backlash.

Following the introduction of Sega<U+2019>s [[Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], Nintendo began to face real competition in the industry, and in the early 1990s was forced to reevaluate its stance towards its developers, many of whom had begun to defect to other systems. When the console was reissued as the [[NES 2]], the [[10NES]] chip was omitted from the console, marking the end of Nintendo<U+2019>s most notorious hold over its third-party developers.

Companies that produced unlicensed games or accessories for the western market include:
*[[Active Enterprises]]
*American Game Cartridges
*[[American Video Entertainment]]
*[[Camerica]]
*[[Color Dreams]]
*[[Galoob]]
*[[Home Entertainment Suppliers]]
*[[Panesian]]
*S.E.I.

== Hardware clones ==
{{main|Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone}}
A thriving market of unlicensed NES hardware [[Clone (computer science)|clones]] emerged during the heyday of the console<U+2019>s popularity. Initially, such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the system. In particular, the [[Dendy]] ({{lang-ru|<U+0414><U+0435><U+043D><U+0434><U+0438>}}), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in [[Russia]] and other nations of the former [[Soviet Union]], emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting, and enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to the that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. The unlicensed clone market has persisted, and even flourished, following Nintendo<U+2019>s discontinuation of the NES. As the NES fades into memory, many such systems have adopted case designs which mimic more recent game consoles. NES clones resembling the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and even current systems like the [[Nintendo GameCube]], the [[PlayStation 2|Sony PlayStation 2]] and the [[Microsoft Xbox]] have been produced. Some of the more exotic of these systems have gone beyond the functionality of the original hardware, and have included variations such as a portable system with a color LCD (e.g. [[Pocket Famicom]]). Others have been produced with certain specialized markets in mind, including various "educational computer packages" which include copies of some of the NES<U+2019>s educational titles and come complete with a clone of the Famicom BASIC keyboard, transforming the system into a rather primitive [[personal computer]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Davidson, Michael | title=Famicom Clones / Pirate Multicarts and Other Weirdness | format=http | work=Obscure Pixels | url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pinwhiz/famicom.htm | accessdate=January 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

As was the case with unlicensed software titles, Nintendo has typically gone to the courts to prohibit the manufacture and sale of unlicensed cloned hardware. Many of the clone vendors have included built-in copies of licensed Nintendo software, which constitutes copyright infringement in most countries. As recently as 2004, Nintendo of America has filed suit against manufacturers of the [[Power Player Super Joy III]], an NES clone system that had been sold in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]].

Although most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, one exception is the Twin Famicom, produced by [[Sharp Corporation]]. The Twin Famicom was compatible with both Famicom cartridges and Famicom Disk System disks. It was available in two colors (red and black) and used similar hardwired controllers to the original Famicom, but featured a different case design.

== Technical specifications ==
[[Image:NES_Punch_Out.png|thumb|right|200px|''[[Mike Tyson's Punch Out!|Punch Out!]]'' was the only official NES title to make use of the MMC2 [[Multi-Memory Controller]] (also known as a "mapper").]]
* Dimensions
** North America:
*** 'toaster' version: 10" width x 8" length x 2.5" height (note that when open, the door over the cartridge slot goes another 1" high)
*** toploader version: 6" width x 7" length x 1 1/2" height
*** cartridge: 5.5" length x 4.1" width
** Japan:
*** cartridge: 3" length x 5.3" width
* [[Central processing unit|CPU]]: [[Ricoh]] [[8-bit]] processor based on [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] core, custom sound hardware, and a restricted [[DMA controller]] on-die
** Region differences
*** [[NTSC]] version, named [[RP2A03]], runs at 1.79 [[Megahertz|MHz]]; this CPU was also used in [[PlayChoice-10]] and [[Nintendo Vs. Series]]
*** [[PAL]] version, named [[RP2A07]], runs at 1.66 MHz
** Main [[Random access memory|RAM]]: 2 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] plus expanded RAM if present on the cartridge
** [[Read only memory|ROM]]: Up to 49128 bytes (just shy of 48 KiB) for ROM, expanded RAM, and cartridge I/O; [[bank switching]] can expand this by orders of magnitude
** Audio: Five sound channels
*** 2 pulse-wave channels, variable [[duty cycle]] (25%, 50%, 75%, 87.5%), 16-level volume control, hardware pitch-bend support, supporting frequencies from 54Hz to 28kHz.
*** 1 triangle-wave channel, fixed volume, supporting frequencies from 27Hz to 56kHz
*** 1 white-noise channel, 16-level volume control, supporting two modes (by adjusting inputs on a [[linear feedback shift register]]) at 16 preprogrammed frequencies
*** 1 [[Delta modulation|delta pulse-code modulation (DPCM)]] channel with 6 bits of range, using 1-bit delta encoding at 16 preprogrammed sample rates from 4.2 [[Kilohertz|kHz]] to 33.5 kHz, also capable of playing standard PCM sound by writing individual 7-bit values at timed intervals.
[[Image:NES Gradius.png|thumb|right|200px|Games like ''[[Gradius]]'' made heavy use of the NES's scrolling capabilities.]]
* [[Picture processing unit]] (PPU): Ricoh custom-made video processor
** Regional differences
*** NTSC version, named [[RP2C02]], runs at 5.37 MHz and outputs [[composite video]]
*** PAL version, named [[RP2C07]], runs at 5.32 MHz and outputs composite video
*** PlayChoice-10 version, named [[RP2C03]], runs at 5.37 MHz and outputs [[RGB#Video electronics|RGB video]] (at NTSC frequencies)
*** Nintendo Vs. Series versions, named [[RP2C04]] and [[RP2C05]], run at 5.37 MHz and output RGB video (at NTSC frequencies) using irregular palettes to prevent easy ROM swapping of games
** Palette: 48 colors and 5 grays in base palette; red, green, and blue can be individually darkened at specific screen regions using carefully timed code.
** Onscreen colors: 25 colors on one [[scanline]] (background color + 4 sets of 3 tile colors + 4 sets of 3 sprite colors), not including color de-emphasis
** Hardware-supported [[sprite (computer science)|sprite]]s
*** Maximum onscreen sprites: 64 (without reloading sprites mid-screen)
*** Sprite sizes: 8<U+00D7>8 or 8<U+00D7>16 pixels (selected globally for all sprites)
*** Maximum number of sprites on one scanline: 8, using a flag to indicate when additional sprites are dropped (to allow the software to rotate sprite priorities, causing [[flicker (screen)|flicker]])
** PPU internal memory: 256 bytes of on-die sprite position/attribute RAM ("OAM") and 28 [[byte]]s of on-die palette RAM (allowing for selection of background and sprite colors) on separate buses internal to the PPU
** PPU external memory (Video RAM): 2 KiB of RAM for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8 KiB of tile pattern ROM or RAM on the cartridge (with bankswitching, virtually any amount can be used within manufacture cost)
** [[Parallax scrolling|Scrolling layers]]: 1 layer, though horizontal scrolling can be changed on a per-scanline basis (as can vertical scrolling via more advanced programming methods)
** [[Display resolution]]: 256<U+00D7>240 pixels, though NTSC games usually used only 256<U+00D7>224, as the top and bottom 8 scanlines are not visible on most television sets (see [[overscan]]); for additional video memory bandwidth, it was possible to turn off the screen before the raster reached the very bottom.
** Video output
*** '''Original NES:''' RCA composite output and RF modulator output
*** '''Original Famicom (Japan) and NES 2:''' RF modulator output only
*** '''AV Famicom:''' Composite video output only, via a Nintendo proprietary 12-pin "multi out" connector first introduced for the Super Famicom/SNES.
*** '''Nintendo Vs. Series:''' inverted RGB video output{{citation needed}}
*** '''PlayChoice 10:''' inverted RGB video output
