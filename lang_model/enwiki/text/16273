[[File:petroglyph jqjacobs.jpg|frame|220px|[[Petroglyph]] attributed to Classic Vernal Style, Fremont archaeological culture, eastern Utah, USA.]]In [[archaeology]], '''rock art''' is human-made markings placed on natural stone; it is largely synonymous with [[parietal art]]. A global phenomenon, rock art is found in many culturally diverse regions of the world. It has been produced in many contexts throughout human history, although the majority of rock art that has been ethnographically recorded has been produced as a part of [[ritual]]. Such artworks are often divided into three forms: [[petroglyphs]], which are carved into the rock surface, [[pictographs]], which are painted onto the surface, and earth figures engraved into the ground.

The oldest known rock art dates from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period, having been found in Europe, Australasia and Africa. Archaeologists studying these artworks believe that they likely had magico-religious significance.

The archaeological sub-discipline of rock art studies first developed in the late-19th century among Francophone scholars studying the Upper Palaeolithic rock art found in the cave systems of Western Europe. Rock art continues to be of importance to [[indigenous peoples]] in various parts of the world, who view them as both [[sacred]] items and significant components of their cultural patrimony.<ref name="Whitley 1"/> Such archaeological sites are also significant sources of cultural tourism, and have been utilised in popular culture for their aesthetic qualities.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. 1&ndash;2.</ref>

==Terminology==
[[File:Buddhas at ili.jpg|thumb|right|Buddhist stone carvings at [[Ili River]], [[Kazakhstan]].]]
The term ''rock art'' appears in the published literature as early as the 1940s.<ref>E. Goodall, ''Proceedings and Transactions of the Rhodesian Scientific Association'' 41:57-62, 1946: "Domestic Animals in rock art"</ref><ref>E. Goodall, ''Proceedings and Transactions of the Rhodesian Scientific Association'' 42:69-74, 1949: "Notes on certain human representations in Rhodesian rock art"</ref> It has also been described as "rock carvings",<ref>H. M. Chadwick, ''Origin Eng. Nation'' xii. 306, 1907: "The rock-carvings at Tegneby"</ref> "rock drawings",<ref>H. A.

==Background==
The defining characteristic of rock art is that it is placed on natural rock surfaces; in this way it is distinct from artworks placed on constructed walls or free-standing sculpture.<ref name="Whitley 3"/> As such, rock art is a form of landscape art, and includes designs that have been placed on boulder and cliff faces, cave walls and ceilings, and on the ground surface.<ref name="Whitley 3">[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 3.</ref> Rock art is a global phenomenon, being found in many different regions of the world.<ref name="Whitley 1">[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 1.</ref>

There are various forms of rock art. These include ''[[pictographs]]'', which were painted or drawn onto the ''panel'' (rock surface), ''[[petroglyphs]]'', which were carved or engraved onto the panel, and ''[[earth figures]]'' such as earthforms, intaglios and geoglyphs. Some archaeologists also consider pits and grooves in the rock, known as ''cups'', ''rings'' or ''cupules'', as a form of rock art.<ref name="Whitley 3"/>

Although there are exceptions, the majority of rock art whose creation was ethnographically recorded had been produced during rituals.<ref name="Whitley 3"/> As such, the study of rock art is a component of the archaeology of religion.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. 3&ndash;4.</ref>

Rock art serves multiple purposes in the contemporary world. In several regions, it remains spiritually important to [[indigenous people]]s, who view it as a significant component of their cultural patrimony.<ref name="Whitley 1"/> It also serves as an important source of cultural tourism, and hence as economic revenue in certain parts of the world. As such, images taken from cave art have appeared on memorabilia and other artefacts sold as a part of the tourist industry.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Types==

===Pictographs===
Pictographs are paintings or drawings that have been placed onto the rock face. Such artworks have typically been made with mineral earths and other natural compounds found across much of the world. The predominantly used colours are red, black and white. Red paint is usually attained through the use of ground [[ochre]], while black paint is typically composed of [[charcoal]], or sometimes from minerals such as [[manganese]]. White paint is usually created from natural chalk, kaolinite clay or diatomaceous earth.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 4.</ref> Once the pigments had been obtained, they would be ground and mixed with a liquid, such as water, blood, urine, or egg yolk, and then applied to the stone as paint using a brush, fingers, or a stamp. Alternately, the pigment could have been applied on dry, such as with a stick of charcoal.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. 4&ndash;5.</ref> In some societies, the paint itself has symbolic and religious meaning; for instance, among hunter-gatherer groups in California, paint was only allowed to be traded by the group shamans, while in other parts of North America, the word for <U+201C>paint<U+201D> was the same as the word for "supernatural spirit".<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 9.</ref>

One unusual form of pictograph, found in many, although not all rock-art producing cultures, is the hand print.  There are three forms of this; the first involves covering the hand in wet paint and then applying it to the rock. The second involves a design being painted onto the hand, which is then in turn added to the surface. The third involves the hand first being placed against the panel, with dry paint then being blown onto it through a tube, in a process that is akin to air-brush or spray-painting. The resulting image is a negative print of the hand, and is sometimes described as a "stencil" in Australian archaeology.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. 7&ndash;9.</ref>

===Petroglyphs===
Petroglyphs are engravings or carvings into the rock panel. They are created with the use of a hard [[hammerstone]], which is battered against the stone surface. In certain societies, the choice of hammerstone itself has religious significance.<ref name="Whitley 11">[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 11.</ref> In other instances, the rock art is pecked out through indirect percussion, as a second rock is used like a [[chisel]] between the hammerstone and the panel.<ref name="Whitley 11"/> A third, rarer form of engraving rock art was through incision, or scratching, into the surface of the stone with a lithic flake or metal blade. The motifs produced using this technique are fine-lined and often difficult to see.<ref name="Whitley 2005. p. 13">[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 13.</ref>

===Earth Figures===
Earth figures are large designs and motifs that are created on the stone ground surface. They can be classified through their method of manufacture.<ref name="Whitley 14">[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 14.</ref> ''[[Intaglio (sculpture)|Intaglio]]s'' are created by scraping away the desert pavements (pebbles covering the ground) to reveal a negative image on the bedrock below. The best known example of such intaglio rock art is the [[Nazca Lines]] of [[Peru]].<ref name="Whitley 14"/> In contrast, ''geoglyphs'' are positive images, which are created by piling up rocks on the ground surface to resulting in a visible motif or design.<ref name="Whitley 14"/>

==Motifs and panels==
Traditionally, individual markings are called [[Motif (art)|motifs]] and groups of motifs are known as ''panels''. Sequences of panels are treated as [[archaeological site]]s. This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact [[ritual]]s. Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Prehistoric rock depictions were not purely descriptive. Each motif and design had a "deep significance" that is not always understandable to modern scholars.<ref>[[#Arc04|Arca 2004]]. p. 319.</ref>

==Ritual uses==
In many instances, the creation of rock art was itself a ritual act.<ref name="Whitley 2005. p. 13"/>

===Relation to shamanism===
[[File:pictograph jqjacobs.jpg|right|thumb|Pictograph, southeastern Utah (USA), attributed to [[Basketmaker culture|Basketmaker]], [[Ancient Pueblo People|Ancient Puebloan]] culture.]]
Some rock art has been interpreted to represent presumed cultural behaviors. Common features in rock art that are related to portraying [[shamans]] were [[bone]]s and other [[skeletal]] remains on their coats. One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of [[armor]] for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  [[Devlet]], the author of "Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism" highlights, <U+201C>Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the [[dismemberment]] that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearer<U+2019>s own [[skeleton]]<U+201D> (43). The concept of [[death]] and [[resurrection|revival]] is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shaman<U+2019>s jacket or used on the breast-piece.  
	
Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed [[fabric]]. There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shaman<U+2019>s body. The symbolism of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways.  One example is, <U+201C>The fringe on a shaman<U+2019>s coat is an important element, which marks his or her [[ornithomorphic]] nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight) <U+201D> (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], [[Tuva]], and [[Mongolia]]n regions.

A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shaman<U+2019>s [[ritualistic]] [[drum]].  Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shaman<U+2019>s drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art.  The range of decoration used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, <U+201C>In the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] [[region]], images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings<U+201D> (Devlet 47).

==Regional variations==

===Europe===
{{Main|Rock art in Europe}}
In the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe, rock art was produced inside cave systems by the hunter-gatherer peoples who inhabited the continent. The oldest known example is the [[Chauvet Cave]] in France, although others have been located, including [[Lascaux]] in France, [[Cave of Altamira|Alta Mira]] in Spain and [[Creswell Crags]] in Britain.

The late prehistoric rock art of Europe has been divided into three regions by archaeologists. In [[Atlantic Europe]], the coastal seaboard on the west of the continent, which stretches from Iberia up through France and encompasses the British Isles, a variety of different rock arts were produced from the Neolithic through to the Late Bronze Age. A second area of the continent to contain a significant rock art tradition was that of [[Alps|Alpine Europe]], with the majority of artworks being clustered in the southern slopes of the mountainous region, in what is now south-eastern France and northern Italy.

Sites in Africa featuring rock art include:
*[[Saharan rock art]]
**[[Tassili n'Ajjer]] in [[Algeria]] - [[national park]] and [[World Heritage Site]], known for its 10,000 year old paintings.
**[[Cave of Swimmers]] is a cave in southwest [[Egypt]], near the border with Libya, along the western edge of the [[Gilf Kebir]] plateau in the central [[Libyan Desert]] (Eastern Sahara). It was discovered in October 1933 by the Hungarian explorer [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Alm<U+00E1>sy]]. It contains among others paintings of people appearing to be swimming, estimated to have been created at least 6,000<U+2013>7000 years ago.
**[[Jebel Uweinat]], a large granite and sandstone mountain (and the adjacent smaller massifs of [[Jebel Arkenu]] and [[Jebel Kissu]] at the converging triple borders of [[Libya]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] harbors one of the richest concentrations of prehistoric rock art in the entire Sahara, mainly of the neolithic cattle pastoralist cultures, but also a number of older paintings from hunter-gatherer societies.

*The [[Rock Paintings of Sierra de San Francisco]] is the name given to prehistoric rock art found in the [[Sierra de San Francisco]] region of [[Baja California]], Mexico, created by a people referred to as Cochimi or Guachimis. There are about 250 sites which are located in the municipality of [[Muleg<U+00E9>]] within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300. The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Australia ===
Australian Indigenous art is the oldest unbroken tradition of art in the world. The oldest firmly dated rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal drawing on a rock fragment found during the excavation of the [[Gabarnmung|Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter]] in south western [[Arnhem Land]] in the [[Northern Territory]]. Dated at 28,000 years, it is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth with a confirmed date. Narwala Gabarnmang is considered to have one of the most extensive collections of rock art in the world and predates both Lascaux and Chauvet cave art, the earliest known art in Europe by at least 10,000 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Bryce|title=Australia<U+2019>s oldest rock art discovered by USQ researcher|url=http://www.usq.edu.au/news-events/News/2012/06/oldestart|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=[[University of Southern Queensland]]|date=18 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Collis|first=Clarisa|title=Ancient artists of rock and soul|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/monashmag/articles/ancient-artists-of-rock-and-soul.html#.Utz4Op0bptQ|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=[[Monash University]]|date=June 2012}}</ref>    
 
In 2008, rock art depicting what is thought to be a [[Thylacoleo]] was discovered on the north-western coast of the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]].<ref name="Willing">{{cite web | last1 = Akerman | first1 = Kim | last2  = Willing | first2 = Tim| date = March 2009 | title = An ancient rock painting of a marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, from the Kimberley, Western Australia | work = [[Antiquity (journal)]]| url = http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/akerman319/ | accessdate = 11 December 2012 }}</ref> As the Thylacoleo is believed to have became extinct 45000<U+2013>46000 years ago (Roberts et al. 2001) (Gillespie 2004), this suggests a similar age for the associated [[Bradshaw rock paintings]]. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] (wetter areas of the continent) as suggested by Wells (1985: 228) and has suggested a much younger age for the paintings.<ref name="Willing"/> Pigments from the "Bradshaw paintings" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even predate Aboriginal settlement.<ref>[http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25338-2286453,00.html TLS.timesonline.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/bradshaws/ Bradshawfoundation.com]</ref>

==Rock Art Studies==
The archaeological sub-discipline devoted to the investigation of rock art is known as "rock art studies." Rock art specialist David S. Whitley noted that research in this area required an "integrated effort" that brings together [[archaeological theory]], method, fieldwork, analytical techniques and interpretation.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. xi.</ref>

===History===
Although French archaeologists had undertaken much research into rock art, Anglophone archaeology had largely neglected the subject for decades.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. viii, 1.</ref>

The discipline of rock art studies witnessed what Whitley called a "revolution" during the 1980s and 1990s, as increasing numbers of archaeologists in the Anglophone world and Latin America turned their attention to the subject.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. x.</ref> In doing so, they recognised that rock art could be used to understand symbolic and religious systems, gender relations, cultural boundaries, cultural change and the origins of art and belief.<ref name="Whitley 1"/> One of the most significant figures in this movement was the South African archaeologist [[David Lewis-Williams]], who published his studies of San rock art from southern Africa, in which he combined ethnographic data to reveal the original purpose of the artworks. Lewis-Williams would come to be praised for elevating rock art studies to a "theoretically sophisticated research domain" by Whitley.<ref>[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. viii.</ref> However, the study of rock art worldwide is marked by considerable differences of opinion with respect to the appropriateness of various methods and the most relevant and defensible theoretical framework.
