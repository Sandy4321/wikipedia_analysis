The '''Kesh Temple Hymn''' or '''Liturgy to Nintud''' or '''Liturgy to Nintud on the creation of man and woman''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s as early as 2600 BC.<ref name="Hansencentret2002">{{cite book|author1=Mogens Herman Hansen|author2=K<U+00F8>benhavns universitet.

Fragments of the text were discovered in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] catalogue of the [[Babylonian]] section (CBS) from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. One fragment of the text found on CBS tablet number 11876 was first published by Hugo Radau in "Miscellaneous Sumerian Texts," number 8 in 1909.<ref name="Radau1909">{{cite book|author=Hugo Radau|title=Miscellaneous Sumerian texts from the temple library of Nippur, 8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=skL-HAAACAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1909|publisher=n.p.}}</ref> Radau's fragment was translated by [[Stephen Langdon]] in 1915.<ref name="LangdonVirolleaud1919">{{cite book|author1=Stephen Langdon|author2=Ch Virolleaud|title=Le po<U+00E8>me sum<U+00E9>rien du Paradis: du d<U+00E9>luge et de la chute de l'homme, 135-146|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-RIDAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1919|publisher=<U+00C9>ditions Ernest Leroux}}</ref> Langdon published a translation from a {{convert/4|4|by|4|by|4|by|4|in|cm}} perforated, four sided, Sumerian [[prism (geometry)|prism]] from Nippur and held in the [[Ashmolean]] in Oxford in 1913 (number 1911-405) in "Babylonian Liturgies." The prism contains around 145 lines in eight sections, similar to the [[Hymn to Enlil]]. Langdon called it "A Liturgy to Nintud, Goddess of Creation" and noted that each section ended with the same refrain, which he interpreted as referring "to the creation of man and woman, the Biblical [[Adam and Eve]]."<ref name="Babylonian liturgies: Sumerian texts from the early period and from the library of Ashurbanipal">{{cite book|title=Babylonian liturgies: Sumerian texts from the early period and from the library of Ashurbanipal, p. 86-|author=Stephen Langdon|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xdy5QAAACAAJ|accessdate=2 June 2011|year=1913|publisher=Geushner}}</ref> Langdon translated two further fragments in 1914 and 1917.

The [[myth]] was developed with the addition of CBS 8384, translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as "Sumerian religious texts" in "[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]," number eleven, entitled "A Fragment of the so-called 'Liturgy to Nintud.'"<ref name="Barton1918">{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 52|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref> The tablet is {{convert/3|5.25|by|2.4|by|1.2|in|cm}} at its thickest point. Barton's tablet contained nine sections from which he was able to translate sections four, five and six. Barton argued for the abandonment of the myth's subtitle, the "creation of man." He claimed, "So far as the writer can see, there is no allusion in the text to the creation of man." He notes only the allusion to the goddess he called Nintu as "the mother of mankind." He suggested, "Apparently the text celebrated the primitive (or very early) conditions of some town; possibly the founding and growth of the town, but beyond this we can confidently affirm nothing."<ref name="Barton1918"/>

[[Robert D. Biggs]] translated an exceptionally archaic version of the hymn from [[Tell]] [[Abu Salabikh]] that he dated to around 2600 BC. He recognized various differences in the archaic [[cuneiform]] and that "the literary texts of this period were unrecognized for so long is due to the fact that they present formidable obstacles to comprehension". He suggests that Abu Salabikh could have been the location of Kesh, however points out that it is not near [[Adab (city)|Adab]] as described and that Kesh could have just been a variation in the spelling of Kish. He discusses how the hymn is preserved for so long in later Nippur texts, saying "Although the Abu Sal<U+00E4>bikh copies are approximately eight centuries earlier than copies known before, there is a surprisingly small amount of deviation (except in [[orthography]]) between them. The Old Babylonian version is thus not a creation of Old Babylonian scribes using older material, but is a faithful reflection of a text that had already been fixed in the Sumerian literary tradition for centuries."<ref name="Biggs">[http://related.springerprotocols.com/lp/de-gruyter/an-archaic-sumerian-version-of-the-kesh-temple-hymn-from-tell-ab-al-b-UDU6yHuFgR Biggs, Robert D., Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische, Arch<U+00E4>ologie , Volume 61 (2), de Gruyter <U+2013> Jan 1, 1971 - Springerprotocols]</ref> Biggs suggested "that other traditional works of literature may also go back in essentially their present form to the last third of the third millennium BC at least."<ref name="Bromiley1979">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey William Bromiley|title=The International standard Bible encyclopedia, p. 754|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DrPYAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2011|year=1979|publisher=W.B.

==Composition==

Victor Hurowitz referred to it as the "Kesh Temple building hymn" and suggests the [[hymn]] begins with a description and [[Enlil]] praising the city Kesh and its selection and establishment of the [[Ekur]] by Enlil. He also discusses the [[writing]] of the hymn by another god called [[Nisaba]].<ref name="Ramet1996"/> Sabrina P. Ramet commented on the presence and role of Nisaba (or Nidaba) in the establishment of the temple. She refers to her as the "goddess of vegetation, writing and literature including astronomical texts, the deity of the "house of understanding" (most likely intelligence), and as she who 'knows the (inmost) secrets of numbers'." Nisaba records the events and provides a "standard version" of the events as they really happened.<ref name="Ramet1996">{{cite book|author=Sabrina P.

Kesh was positioned there for him with head uplifted, and as Kesh lifted its head among all the lands, Enlil spoke the praises of Kesh. Nisaba was its decision-maker; with its words she wove it intricately like a net. Written on tablets it was held in her hands: House, platform of the Land, important fierce [[bull]]!<ref name="ETCSL"/>}}

The myth goes on to describe the temple dedication rites and explains that the [[Annanuki]] were the lords of the temple. He suggests that the hymn mentions "objects placed in the temple upon its completion."<ref name="Hurowitz1992">{{cite book|author=Victor Hurowitz|title=I have built you an exalted house: temple building in the Bible in the light of Mesopotamian and North-West semitic writings|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qajrNB_7kGMC&pg=PA66|accessdate=2 June 2011|date=1 June 1992|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9781850752820|pages=66, 67, 261}}</ref> His translation of the introduction reads:

{{cquote|Temple ... Kesh Temple growing up like a mountain embracing the heaven. Growing up like Ekur when it lifted its head in the Land.<ref name="Hurowitz1992"/>}}

The hymn is composed of 134 lines, formally divided into eight songs or "houses" or "temples", each of which ends with three [[rhetorical]] questions discussing the birth of Nintud's warrior son, [[Acgi]]:<ref name="BlackBlack2006"/><ref>[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~piotrm/DBtext1.htm Michalowski Piotr., Epics, Hymns, and Letters pp. 248-256 in Jacques Briend and Michel Quesnel, eds., Suppl<U+00E9>ment au Dictionnaire de la Bible, fascicule 72.

{{cquote|Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Kesh? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Acgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintud?.<ref name="Hurowitz1992"/>}}

Lines one to twenty one describe the election and praise of Kesh as recorded by Nisaba, twenty two to forty four liken the temple to the [[moon]] against the sky containing the life sources of Sumer and its cosmic dimensions filling the world. Lines forty five to fifty seven give a metaphorical description of the temple reaching both for the heaven and descending into the underworld. Lines fifty eight to seventy three discuss the complexities of the temple with vast quantities of oxen and sheep. The temple is likened to the trees from which wood was used in its construction. The gods and functions of the temple are described and praised during temple dedication with different parts of the temple described: its interior and exterior appearance, its gate, courtyard, door and walls. The hymn ends on the conclusion to approach the temple.<ref name="SjobergGragg1969"/>

Wayne Horowitz working from Gragg's translation, discusses the mention of the [[Abzu]] in the myth saying it "occurs as a name for the cosmic waters of the water table beneath the earth's surface in Sumerian literature."<ref name="Horowitz1998">{{cite book|author=Wayne Horowitz|title=Mesopotamian cosmic geography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&pg=PA308|accessdate=3 June 2011|year=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=9780931464997|pages=308<U+2013>}}</ref>

{{cquote|Temple, great crown reaching heaven. Temple, rainbow reaching heaven. Temple, whose gleam stretches into 'Heaven's Midst', whose foundation is fastened on the Abzu.<ref name="Horowitz1998"/>}}

The latest translation describes its founders, [[geography]] and features:

{{cquote|House founded by [[Anu|An]], praised by Enlil, given an oracle by mother Nintud! ... house, at its upper end a [[mountain]], at its lower end a [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]! House, at its upper end threefold indeed ... Whose well-founded [[granary|storehouse]] is established as a household ... whose terrace is supported by ''lahama'' deities; whose princely great wall ... the shrine of Urim!<ref name="ETCSL"/>}}

Barton translated the actions of the Annanuki in and around the temple:

{{cquote|In it their heroes were collected; they were noble. In decisions rendered, the word of all the gods, they rejoiced; The fields, - the sheep and oxen were like an ox of the stall; the [[Cedrus|cedars]] spoke; they were like messengers; The field invited the oxen all of them; The field strengthened the sheep all of them; Their fig-trees on the bank of the boat filled; The weapon the lord, the prince ... lifted up; The luluppi-tree of the wife of the god, the pi-pi-plants of ... In [[hursag]] the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)|garden of the god]] were green.<ref name="Barton1918"/>}}

[[Jeremy Black (assyriologist)|Jeremy Black]] suggests the hymn describes the statues of bulls or lions that were placed at the entrances to temples "Kesh temple, <before which> (something) in the shape of winged lions stands, (something) in the shape of 'white' wild bulls stands facing the desert." The hymn discusses music being played at the temple towards the end with drums and the coarse sound of a bull's horn sounding at temple ceremonies: "the wild bull's horn was made to growl, the ''algarsura'' instrument was made to thud."<ref name="BlackBlack1998">{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Jeremy A.

He proposed that the ''tigi'' was probably a hymn accompanied by [[lyre]], that ''irshemma'' was perhaps one accompanied by a type of [[drum]] and that ''adab'' possibly a hymn accompanied by another form of string instrument.<ref name="Kramer1964">{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: their history, culture and character|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&pg=PA207|accessdate=3 June 2011|year=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226452388|pages=207<U+2013>}}</ref>

The hymn finishes with an admonition repeated four times suggested to be both a warning and invocation of the divine presence in the temple. Such ambivalence about approaching temples has crucially influenced the development of [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] [[mysticism]].<ref>[http://trincoll.academia.edu/SethSanders/Papers/192570/Old_Light_on_Moses_Shining_Face Sanders, Seth L., Old light on Moses' shining face, Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2002.]</ref>

A.R. George suggests such hymns "can be incorporated into longer compositions, as with the eulogy to Nippur and Ekur which makes up a large portion of a well-known [[Hymn to Enlil]] and the hymn to temples in Ur that introduces a [[Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D)|Shulgi hymn]]."<ref name="George1992">{{cite book|author=A.

==Discussion==

Stephen Langdon suggested the hymn gave evidence of the Sumerian theological view that [[Enlil]] and [[Ninlil]] created mankind and living things. He noted that [[Nintud]], the primary goddess of Kesh was "a form of Ninlil in Nippur : in other words she is Ninlil of Kesh, where her character as goddess of begetting was emphasized." He noted based on an observation of Theophilus G. Pinches, that Ninlil or [[Belit Ilani]] had seven different names (such as Nintud, [[Ninhursag]], Ninmah, etc.) for seven different localities.<ref name="England)1911">{{cite book|author=Society of Biblical Arch<U+00E6>ology (London, England)|title=Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 33, Pl.
