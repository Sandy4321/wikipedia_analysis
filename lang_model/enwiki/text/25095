The '''Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech''' is the name of the official mascot of the student body at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. The Ramblin' Wreck is a 1930 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] [[Sports coupe]] and it embodies the spirit, tradition, and passion of the Tech student body.  The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions.  Its most noticeable role is leading the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|football team]] onto [[Bobby Dodd Stadium|Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field]], a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck is mechanically and financially maintained on campus by students in the Ramblin' Reck Club.

The first Wreck was a 1914 [[Ford Model T]] owned by Dean Floyd Field. Until the current Wreck was donated to the school in 1961, most of the early Ramblin' Wrecks were owned by students, faculty or alumni. The modern Wreck has donned a number of different paint jobs and has had several restorations and modifications made to it. These changes were done by various individuals and organizations over the years, including [[Bobby Dodd]] and a Georgia Tech Alum at the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] plant in [[Hapeville, Georgia]]. The upkeep of the Wreck has been the sole responsibility of the Ramblin' Reck Club and the Wreck driver since 1987. 

The Ramblin' Wreck has been the target of a number of pranks perpetrated by rival schools; the [[University of Tennessee]] once provided the Wreck with an unsolicited new paint job, and the [[University of Georgia]] has kidnapped the Wreck on at least two occasions. Several replica or "false" Wrecks  are owned by alumni, or are used for display and do not run. The official Ramblin' Wreck is considered the only "true" Wreck, and no backups or replacements exist.

The term "Ramblin' Wreck" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the car that now bears the name has been in existence. The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of [[South America]].<ref name="survivalguide">{{cite news|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/pdfs/freshman_survival_guide-2002-08-23.pdf|format=PDF|title=Freshman Survival Guide|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2002-08-23]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> The Wrecks were constructed from whatever the engineers could find&mdash;mostly old tractor and automotive parts&mdash;and were kept running by the engineers' ingenuity and creativity. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as "Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech."<ref name="survivalguide"/>

The first "mechanical mascot" at Georgia Tech was a 1914 [[Ford Model T]] owned by Dean Floyd Field.  Field drove the car to and from class every day from 1916 until 1929.<ref name="modelT1">{{Citation

The black box's contents were never revealed to the student body and the box became part of the mystique of the Old Ford.<ref name="modelT2">{{Citation

The student body initially nicknamed the vehicle "Floyd's Flubber" but eventually began to call the car the "Ramblin' 'Reck."  The first mention of Field's Ford as a Ramblin' Wreck was in 1926 when he performed an overhaul of the car's motor, body, and paint job with the help of the campus machine shop.<ref name="modelT4">{{Citation

Dean Field found a love for travel with his Model T.<ref name="modelT1"/>  He took it all the way to California for seminars on mathematics and education.<ref name="modelT1"/>  However, in 1927 rumors began to abound campus that Field was going to buy a Model A.<ref name="modelT5">{{Citation

[[Image:ramblinwreckengine.jpg|left|thumb|The Ramblin' Wreck motor built in October of 1929]]
In memorium to his retired "[[Tin Lizzie]]", Dean Field started "an Old Ford Race" from [[Atlanta, GA|Atlanta]] to [[Athens, GA|Athens]] in 1929.  The race was sponsored by the ''Technique'', which nicknamed the event the "Flying Flivver Race."<ref name="fordrace">{{Citation

The Yellow Jacket Club facilitated the first Ramblin' Wreck parade in 1932.  The Wreck Parade still remains and has become a centerpiece of Tech homecomings since its inception.<ref name="clubhistory">{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/reckHistory.php|title=History of the Ramblin' Wreck|publisher=The Ramblin' Reck Club|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars.  Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm.  It was considered a [[rite of passage]] to own a broken down vehicle.<ref name="driveon">{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Guyton|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2007-06-29/focus/3|title=Ramblin' Wreck drives on|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2007-06-29]]|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref><ref name="gagirl">{{cite news|first=Mary|last=Cobb|title = Georgia Girl owns $25 Tech Wreck| work = Atlanta Constitution| date = [[1951-05-13]]}}</ref>

In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute.  He specifically wanted a classic pre-[[World War II|war]] Ford.  Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle.  The search would take him throughout the state and country but no suitable vehicle was ever found until Autumn of 1960.  Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in [[Towers Hall (Georgia Tech)|Towers Dormitory]].  The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief [[Delta Air Lines]] pilot.<ref name="driveon"/>

Johnson had purchased the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore the car as a father-son project while Craig attended the [[Georgia Military Academy]].<ref name="delta">{{Citation

He bought the [[mahogany]] dash from a parts dealer in [[Caracas|Caracas, Venezuela]] and used [[Corvair|Corvair 440]] aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended [[Florida State]] on a track scholarship.  In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech.  Johnson wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.<ref name="images"/>

When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000 but would eventually return the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund.<ref name="images"/> The Ramblin' Wreck would be officially transferred to the Athletic Association on [[May 26]], [[1961]].<ref name="clubhistory"/>

The Ramblin' Wreck was unveiled [[September 30]], [[1961]] at Grant Field in front of 43,501&nbsp;Tech fans as it led the team onto the field against [[Rice University]]. The team prevailed 24<U+2013>0 and the Wreck became an instant success within the Tech family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/acc/georgia_tech/yearly_results.php?year=1960|title=Georgia Tech Yearly Results, 1960<U+2013>1964|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

===Bobby Dodd's touch===
[[Image:1979wreckfb.jpg|right|thumb|Image of the Wreck in a 1979 issue of ''The Technique'']]
The current color scheme was selected in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach [[Bobby Dodd]]. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield on both the driver and passenger side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an [[Old Gold|old gold]] paint from a [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme.<ref>{{cite web

   | title = 1974 Lincoln Metallic Gold (6L Gold Poly)

   | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}</ref> He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.<ref name="rtroll"/>

The biggest structural change was a support system attached to the car's frame. The support system runs the length of the running boards and allows the increased weight of cheerleaders or Reck Club members standing on the runningboards.<ref name="godfather">{{cite news | title = 'Godfather of the Wreck' - Pete George Restored Tech's Model A | work = Tech Topics | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | date = Spring 2004}}</ref> 

From 1973 to 1987, '47 [[industrial engineering|IE]] alum Pete George maintained the Ramblin' Wreck at the [[Hapeville, GA|Hapeville]] Ford Plant.<ref name="carcollector">{{cite news|first=Preston|last=Stevens|title = The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech| work = Car Collector & Car Classics| publisher = Classic Publishing, Inc.| date = December 1991}}</ref> George would mastermind the 1974 change of colors as well as a major refurbishment of the Wreck in 1982 in time for Georgia Tech's 1985 centennial celebration. The car was completely disassembled, rebuilt, and repainted by late 1982.<ref name="godfather"/><ref name="wreck82">{{cite news|first=Norman|last=Arey|title = 'Ramblin' Reck' has facelift too| work = Atlanta Journal-Constitution| date = [[1982-09-10]]}}</ref>

===Centennial Celebration changes===
There were a few noticeable changes to the Ramblin' Wreck after the 1982 refurbishment.  An aftermarket [[Chrome plating|chrome]] stone guard was added to protect the grill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikes-afordable.com/miva/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=A18700B&Category_Code=|title=Stone Guards 1930: Mike's "A" Ford-Able Parts|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The emblems on the side were removed and replaced by a basic GT decal on the doors.  The 1952 Yellow Jackets were moved to the front tire wells. The white horn was chromed over. The old tire cover was a shield with a football helmet wearing yellow jacket.  This was replaced with a white generic [[naugahyde]] Ford tire cover.  The Old Model A tires and brakes were replaced with [[Ford Model B (1932)|Model B]] [[whitewall tire]]s and modified brakes.<ref name="carcollector"/>

[[Image:RamblinWrecktag.jpg|left|thumb|The Ramblin' Wreck license plate was issued in 1958. The Wreck is Georgia Historical Vehicle #563.]]
The Wreck experienced a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration.  Since Reck Club had financially maintained the vehicle for so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot.  The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.<ref name="driveon" />

After Pete George's retirement in 1987, the upkeep of the Wreck fell directly upon the shoulders of the Wreck Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club. Since then, the Wreck has been student maintained with the assistance of local Atlanta garages. The Wreck has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild.<ref name="rtroll"/>

After 1994, Reck Club restored the wheels and brakes to original Model A specifications. Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 that saw the car repainted and motor be rebuilt.<ref name="driveon"/> Pete George, although several years retired, aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration. After the restoration, a small modification replaced the [[electrical generator]] with a more efficient Nu-Rex [[alternator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nurex.com/|title=Nu-Rex: Antique Ford Parts|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> In 2007, Reck Club coordinated their second major restoration following a trailering accident that severely damaged the body and top of the Ramblin' Wreck.<ref name="rtroll">{{cite news|first=Bo|last=Emerson|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/gatech/stories/2007/09/05/0906_wreck.html|title=Ramblin' Wreck ready to roll again?|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=[[2007-09-05]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>

===Modern role of the Wreck===
Although the Ramblin' Wreck has led the Yellow Jacket football team onto Grant Field almost 300&nbsp;games, the Wreck also makes it a point to support the other Georgia Tech sports teams.  The Wreck is often seen or heard by Tech fans before big [[basketball]] games at [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]].  The Wreck is occasionally seen parked outside of [[Russ Chandler Stadium]] during warm weekend [[baseball]] series.  And the Wreck has attended several [[softball]] games a year as there is ample parking overlooking the first base line of [[Glenn Field (softball)|Glenn Field]].<ref name="beep">{{cite news|first=Kristin|last=Noell|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-10-03/focus/2|title=Faces at Georgia Tech: Beep beep!

The Wreck is a constant reminder of the Institute's rich academic and collegiate tradition.  This makes the old Model A the perfect prop for special events on campus.  As new buildings appear on campus, the Wreck is always present to oversee the ribbon cutting or dedication.  The Wreck was the first car to drive across the newly constructed [[Technology Square|Fifth Street Bridge]] on [[December 5]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facultysenate.gatech.edu/ASGF2007-112806-Minuteswp.htm|title=Fall meeting of the academic senate & called meeting of the general faculty |publisher=Georgia Tech Faculty Senate|date=2006-11-28|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> A ride in the Wreck also serves as a gift to many retiring faculty and staff.  In fact, a ride in the Wreck onto Grant Field is one of the greatest honors Georgia Tech can bestow upon a distinguished individual.  [[Kim King]], for example, received this honor on [[October 2]], [[2004]] during halftime of the [[Miami Hurricanes|Miami]] game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.whistle.gatech.edu/archives/04/oct/18/kingobit.shtml|title=Prominent alumnus Kim King dies|work=The Whistle|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|date=[[2004-10-18]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>

Every Spring, the Institute holds a ceremony known as When the Whistle Blows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whenthewhistleblows.gatech.edu/|title=When the Whistle Blows|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> This ceremony is held to honor the deceased students, staff, and faculty over the academic year.  The [[Georgia Tech traditions#The Whistle|Georgia Tech Whistle]] is blown once for each person that has passed and once more  for any Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may have passed in the year.  A [[procession]] of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the actual ceremony. During the ceremony, the Wreck is parked adjacent to the speaker's stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whenthewhistleblows.gatech.edu/history.php|title=When the Whistle Blows: History|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref>

The Wreck is also a servant to the student body of Georgia Tech.  It is present at every Freshman Orientation (FASET), [[Earth Day]] festival, and other campuswide events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/uploads/Section%201.pdf|format=PDF|title=GT Parents Program Parent Handbook|pages=11|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faset.gatech.edu/|title=Freshman Orientation (FASET)|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> The Ramblin' Wreck is ever present for the [[Alumni|Alum]] during Tech Homecoming. The Wreck acts as a giant gold [[starter pistol]] for the [[Mini 500]] [[tricycle]] race several days before Homecoming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/homecoming/images/gallery/344.jpg|title=Ramblin' Wreck leading Mini 500|publisher=Georgia Tech Homecoming|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> The Wreck's next task is to lead the racers out of the starting line in the [[Georgia Tech traditions#Freshman Cake Race|Freshman Cake Race]].

==Specifics and clarifications==
[[Image:ramblinwreckflags.jpg|left|thumb|The Ramblin' Wreck's flags]]
There are several lesser known details about the Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive.  Specific physical details and the actual person behind the wheel are often missed or overlooked.  The Wreck is financially maintained through Reck Club appearances and fundraisers.  There is no official source of funding from the Institute, Athletic Association, or Alumni Association.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nathan|last=Fowler|url=http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/06/19/ramblin-wreck-gets-in-a-wreck/|title=Ramblin' Wreck Gets In a Wreck|publisher=AOL Sports Blog|date=[[2007-06-19]]|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>  This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is atypical amongst college mascots.<ref name="beep"/>

When a freshman first reaches campus for FASET (orientation), one of the many traditions that they are introduced to is that freshmen cannot touch the Wreck until the completion of their first year.  If a freshman touches the Wreck between [[convocation]] and the last day of classes in the Spring, they will receive bad luck throughout their college career and GT will be [[curse]]d to lose to UGA in football that year.<ref name="survivalguide"/>  The Reck Club strictly enforces this rule throughout football season and Spring semester.<ref name="survivalguide"/>

The Wreck is distinguished by its [[old gold]] body and white soft top.  The soft top has a chrome [[Landau (automobile)|support strut]], which features a [[brass]] classic Tech T and 1952 [[yellow jacket]].  The body also has two solid white runningboards, which run the length of the vehicle.  The running boards support cheerleaders or the occasional [[Techie]]s looking for a ride.  The interior upholstery is gold and white striped [[pleather]].  The gear shifter knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it.  There are two golden [[nylon]] pennants emblazoned with the words "To Hell With Georgia" and "Give 'Em Hell Tech" fastened to the front bumper.<ref name="flags">{{cite web|url=http://www.southerntailors.com/gallery.html|title=Southern Tailors : makers of the Ramblin' Wreck pennants|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

The Driver gets to add his own personal touch every year to the Wreck.  The front [[license plate]] is chosen by the driver every year and the [[radiator]] cap is replaced yearly as well.  The cap is typically a flying [[quail]] or a [[wreath]].  After each driver's term, the driver gets to keep the two pennants as well.

Dean Dull initiated a group known as the Ramblin' Reck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot.  When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Reck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree.<ref name="deklerount">{{Citation

==Travelin' Wreck==
In its history, the Wreck has appeared at a number of away games and other events away from the Georgia Tech campus. Many of these trips resulted in damage to the Wreck or other interesting anecdotes.

The first away game for the Ramblin' Wreck was the 1961 game against the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]].<ref name="30ford"/>  The Wreck was freighted by [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].  At the time, Alabama played its home games at [[Legion Field]].  Before the game the current driver Dekle Rountree decided to traverse the slope up to visit Birmingham's [[Vulcan statue]].  The trip to Birmingham was such a success, a trip to [[Jacksonville, FL|Jacksonville]] for Tech's [[Gator Bowl]] appearance against [[Penn State]] was organized as well.  These would be the first road and bowl game appearances for the Wreck in its illustrious career.<ref name="wrecktravel">{{Citation

In 1963, the Ramblin' Reck Committee and Ramblin' Reck Club organized another road trip for the Wreck.  This trip would take the Wreck up to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] for a game against the [[Tennessee Volunteers]].<ref name="wrecktravel2">{{cite news

After the 1968 victory over [[Auburn University]], an angered Auburn fan shot the radiator with a rifle.<ref name="driveon"/> The Wreck has also been stolen by [[University of Georgia]] fans twice.<ref name="clubhistory"/>

In 1976, Tech students took the Wreck to Athens for the annual football game with UGA.<ref name="rtroll"/>  After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car.  The vehicle appeared relatively unprotected and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it.  The Tech students responsible for the car's safekeeping frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed [[9 mm caliber|9 mm pistol]].<ref name="rtroll"/>

The furthest the Ramblin' Wreck has ever traveled from home was [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]] in 1990 for Tech's [[NCAA Final Four]] Appearance against [[University of Nevada-Las Vegas|Nevada-Las Vegas]].  The Wreck was freighted by van {{convert|1400|mi|km|-1}} to [[Denver Coliseum]].<ref name="1990FF"/>  Along the way, a television crew documented the trip and broadcasted the Wreck's expedition during the Final Four promotions.<ref name="1990FF">{{cite news

The last major roadtrips for the Ramblin' Wreck were to the 2004 Final Four in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] and the 2006 [[ACC football championship game]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]].<ref name="wrecktravel3">{{cite news|first=Kristin|last=Noell|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2004-04-16/focus/2|title=Q100 road trip makes for Final Four memories|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2004-04-16]]|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>  The Wreck led the Yellow Jacket football team onto [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium|AllTel Stadium]]'s field for Tech's first appearance in the ACC Title game.  The Wreck has also been to the [[Gator Bowl]], [[Sun Bowl]], [[Peach Bowl]], [[Citrus Bowl]], and [[Champs Sports Bowl]].<ref name="rtroll"/>

On [[June 15]], [[2007]] the Wreck was involved in an accident while being towed to a wedding south of Atlanta in a covered car trailer. The trailer failed while carrying the Wreck in turn causing the truck and trailer to run off the road and into the roadside ditch. The Wreck fell over inside the trailer, causing damage to its side and roof.<ref name="AP">{{cite news

==In the media==
In 1987, the Ramblin' Wreck and Dean Dull were featured on [[ABC-TV]]'s morning show. Dean Dull shouted into the camera, "I'm Dean of Students Jim Dull and I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech. Good Morning America!"<ref name="dull2">{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Goettling|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/fall91/hamandwry.html|title=Ham and Wry: Humor Helps Dean Dull Weather 34-Year Career|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Fall 1991|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> Dull was on the show because he had won a make-a-wish contest. All he wanted was for the Ramblin' Wreck, gold-clad students, and himself to be on the ABC morning show and ABC granted the wish.<ref name="dull"/>

The Ramblin' Wreck has been featured in several newspapers, magazines, and books.  The June 1986 edition of Cars & Parts Magazine featured the Ramblin' Wreck and the raffle for the Centennial Wreck.<ref name="carcollector2">{{cite news|first=|last=|title = "Ramblin' Wreck" - Model A| work = Car & Parts| publisher = Amos Press Incorporated| date = June 1986}}</ref>  The December 1991 Car Collector & Car Classics featured the Wreck on the cover after the National Championship season.<ref name="carcollector"/> The December 2007 Bellsouth Real White Pages for Greater Atlanta featured the Ramblin' Wreck with censored flags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airbornecombatengineer.typepad.com/photos/gt_football/wreckatlwhitepageswr.jpg|title=Wreck on cover of ATL white pages|publisher=Airborne Combat Engineer|accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref>  The Ramblin' Wreck has been featured numerous times in Tech's student newspaper [[the Technique]] and the [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]].<ref name="deklerount"/><ref name="30ford"/> The Wreck has also been featured in the [[New York Times]] and [[Associated Press]].<ref name="AP"/><ref name="1990FF"/>  Local newspapers such as the [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] Times, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]] Daily Post, and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] Chronicle have also printed articles about the Wreck.<ref name="gpost">{{cite news|url=http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=1102&SectionID=6&SubSectionID=84&S=1|first=Ryan|last=Crawford|title=Local shop repairing wrecked Wreck|work=Gwinnett Daily Post|date=[[2007-07-21]]|accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref><ref name="driver"/><ref name="driver2"/>

In the week prior to the 2007 home opener, the Ramblin' Wreck was featured on [[ESPN First Take]].<ref name="espn"/> ESPN showed old clips of the Wreck leading the football team onto the field and discussed the possibility of the Wreck not making the football opener after 45 consecutive years of never missing a game.<ref name="espn"/>

==False Wrecks==
[[Image:Alumni Association Ramblin' Wreck cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The Alumni Association's "Alumni Wreck," a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster]]
[[Image:Georgia Tech Conf Hotel Fake Wreck.jpg|thumb|right|The 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe shell in the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center]]
There are several vehicles that claim "Ramblin' Wreck status."  However, there is only one modern official Ramblin' Wreck.  There are no backups or equivalent vehicles.<ref name="pledges"/>
*The most famous of the fake Wrecks is a 1931 Ford Model A Cabriolet known as the ''Centennial Wreck''.  This vehicle was refurbished along with the real Wreck in 1985 and auctioned for $250,000 by Pete George with the proceeds going towards the Institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/wreck.html|title=Ramblin' Memories: Ramblin' Wreck|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>
*In the late 1980s the Alumni Association purchased a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster. The ''Alumni Wreck'' is distinguished by its spare tire locations on the driver's side and passenger's side runningboards and the words "Georgia Tech Alumni Association" printed on the doors. It also has a [[convertible]] top. The real Wreck's spare is behind the rumble seat and cannot remove its roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/wreck/images/wreck/fullsize/013.jpg|title=Georgia Tech Alumni Wreck|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref>
*There is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe shell in the Georgia Tech Hotel.  This car has not worked since it has been on campus.  The motor is incomplete and the front end lacks the Wreck's chrome stone guard.  This is the only replica that is allowed to brandish flags similar to the real Wreck.  Instead of having a rumble seat, this vehicle has a modified trunk space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatechhotel.com/index2.asp|title=Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center|publisher=Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/wreck/images/wreck/fullsize/012.jpg|title=Georgia Tech Hotel Replica Wreck|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref>
*There are also several alumni owned vehicles that are painted to resemble the Wreck. These vehicles mimic the look and feel of the Wreck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck.  One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988.<ref name="BoTullis"/>  A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at [[Sanford Stadium]] in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]].  After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 [[Ford Model T]], the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].<ref name="BoTullis">{{cite news
