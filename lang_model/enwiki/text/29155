"'''Billy Boys'''", also titled "'''The Billy Boys'''",<ref name= "linfield" /> is a [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] song from [[Glasgow]], sung to the tune of "[[Marching Through Georgia]]."<ref name= "linfield" /> It originated in the 1930s as the signature song of one of the [[Glasgow razor gangs]] led by Billy Fullerton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=822932004 |title=Evil faces of Glasgow's gangsters revealed |work=The Scotsman |date=2004-07-19 |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> and later became viewed to reflect the long running [[sectarian]] divide in the city. It is associated in particular with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] football club.

==Origins==
"Billy Boys" originated in the 1920s as the signature tune of the Brigton Boys, also called The Billy Boys of Brigton Cross, who were a  Protestant street gang in Glasgow led by Billy Fullerton.<ref name=pub /> The gang often clashed with [[Catholic]] gangs such as the [[Norman Conks]]. Fullerton was a former member of the [[British Fascists]], and was awarded a medal for strike-breaking during the [[1926 General Strike]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyeve23.htm |title=Resistance to fascism|publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> The song's geographic roots relate to Bridgeton Cross in [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], an area of Glasgow historically associated with the city's Protestant population, and with [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionism]]. ''Brigton'' is the [[Scots language|Scots]] form of Bridgeton. The "Billy Boys" song was often sung loudly when the gang performed it. They regularly sang it when they marched through primarily Catholic areas of Glasgow on Catholic holy days. This often led to the Brigton Boys being attacked by members of the Norman Conks as a result.<ref>{{cite book | first =Peter | last =Haining  | title =The Jail That Went to Sea: An Untold Story of the Battle of the Atlantic, 1941-42| publisher = Anova Books| edition =   | year = 2007| isbn = 1844860507 | page = 54}}</ref> Despite being primarily based in Glasgow, in the 1930s the Brigton Boys were invited to march in Belfast and sang "Billy Boys" while they were there as part of [[The Twelfth]] celebrations.<ref name=gang>{{cite book | first =Andrew | last =Davies  | title =City of Gangs: Glasgow and the Rise of the British Gangster| publisher = Hatchett UK | edition =   | year = 2013| isbn = 1444739786 | chapter = 11: The Billy Boys in Belfast}}</ref>

The Brigton Boys and their youth wing, the Derry Boys, started to attend football matches in the late '20s and early '30s. During this time, they attended Rangers matches and Rangers fans started to sing the "Billy Boys" song as part of a perceived affiliation with the Brigton Boys.<ref name=pub>{{cite book | first =Richard | last =Bessel  | title =Patterns of Provocation: Police and Public Disorder | publisher = Berghahn Books | edition =   | year = 2000| isbn = 157181227X | pages = 45<U+2013>47}}</ref> Despite Percy Stillton, the Chief Constable of Glasgow, eradicating the razor gangs in Glasgow and most young Protestants joining the [[Orange Order]] instead of the remaining gangs, Rangers fans still sang the "Billy Boys" in tribute to Fullerton as he still remained a visible presence in Glasgow's Protestant community after the gangs had disbanded.<ref>{{cite book | first =Liam | last =McIlvanney  | title =All the Colours of the Town | publisher = Faber & Faber | edition =   | year = 2011| isbn = 0571278515 | pages = 69<U+2013>70}}</ref> The Orange Order then adopted the "Billy Boys" song and changed the lyrics to be played on [[Orange walk]]s with the references to Billy being altered to refer to King [[William III of England|William III of England, Scotland and Ireland]] when played by the Orange Order.<ref name=gg>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.glasgowguide.co.uk/wjmc/billyboy.shtml |title=Hurrah!

Even after Fullerton's death, Rangers fans continued to sing "Billy Boys" to commemorate Fullerton and the Brigton Boys.<ref>{{cite paper|url=https://www.gold.ac.uk/media/ogasawara.pdf |title=Performing Sectarianism: Terror, Spectacle and Urban Myth in Glasgow Football Cultures |publisher=[[Goldsmiths, University of London]] |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> In later years the song became considered sectarian against Catholics, despite it was initially created as a song against [[Irish republicanism]].<ref>{{cite book | first =John | last =Flint  | title =Bigotry, Football, and Scotland | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | edition =   | year = 2013| isbn = 074867036X | page = 45}}</ref>  In 1999, the [[Scotland national football team manager]] [[Craig Brown (footballer born 1940)|Craig Brown]] was filmed singing "Billy Boys" and faced calls to step down from his position in charge of the [[Scotland national football team]].

The song was at the centre of a controversy surrounding "ninety-minute bigots", an expression allegedly coined by former Rangers chairman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|Sir David Murray]]: "Ninety-minute Bigots do not hold beliefs but nonetheless sing songs at football matches which are sectarian, simply to join in with the rest of the crowd."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4264669.stm|title='First steps' on end to bigotry| accessdate=2007-01-14|date=2005-02-14|publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> Rangers have adopted several measures to tackle this behaviour including attempts to bring older Rangers songs back into popular use, with Murray speaking out against the singing of the "Billy Boys" on many occasions.<ref name=trad>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5244022.stm |title=Rangers revive traditional songs |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> In 2006, Rangers were charged by UEFA for discriminatory chanting over the singing of "Billy Boys" during a [[UEFA Champions League]] game against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]].
