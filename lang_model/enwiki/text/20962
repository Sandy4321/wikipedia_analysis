==History of the term==
[[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]] states that since the term "transsexual" is very new, it is necessary to examine historical specifics to identify transsexuality in history, and distinguish it from other roles that are described as "change of sex", such as homosexuality and heterosexual [[cross-dressing]] customs.<ref name="green">{{cite web|author=Green R|date=1966|url=http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/appendix_c.htm|title=Transsexualism: Mythological, Historical, and Cross-Cultural Aspects|publisher=Benjamin H, ''The Transsexual Phenomenon.'' Julian Press ASIN B0007HXA76}}</ref> Green describes the cultural roles of groups such as the [[Two-Spirit]], [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]], [[Kathoey]] and [[Khanith]], stating that these people are mentally indistinguishable from modern western transsexuals.<ref name="green"/> In part, because of this history, past researchers have referred to the "homosexual" category as being the "classic", "primary" or "true" transsexual.<ref name="classicBlanchard"/> At one time due to the [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] bias of many psychologists, transsexual people who did not fit into this category were often screened from receiving hormones and [[sex reassignment surgery]].<ref name="classicBlanchard"/><ref name="morgan1978"/>

==Description by western science==
The concept of a taxonomy based on transsexual sexuality was first proposed by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] in 1923,<ref name="hirschfeld1923">Hirschfeld M (1923). Die intersexuelle Konstitution. ''Jarhbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen''. 1923: 3-27</ref> and codified by [[Harry Benjamin]] in the [[Benjamin Scale]].<ref name="benjamin1966">Benjamin H (1966). ''[http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/ The Transsexual Phenomenon.]'' The Julian Press ASIN: B0007HXA76</ref> [[Kurt Freund]] proposed two types of cross-gender identity, based on his observation that [[gender identity disorder]] is different for homosexual males and heterosexual males.<ref name="freund1982">Freund K, Steiner BW, Chan S (1982). Two types of cross-gender identity. ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]],'' 1982 Feb;11(1):49-63.</ref> Published reports measure a "homosexual transsexual" at a Kinsey Scale 5-6 or a Modified Androphilia Scale 9.86<U+00B1>2.37.<ref name="lawrence2005"/><ref name="leavitt1990"/> [[Ray Blanchard]] saw that homosexual transsexuals were younger when applying for sex reassignment, reported a stronger cross-gender identity in childhood, had a more convincing cross-gender appearance, and functioned psychologically better than "non-homosexual" transsexuals.<ref name="blanchard1987">Blanchard R, Clemmensen LH, Steiner BW (1987).

===Sexual activity===
Leavitt and Berger further categorized homosexual transsexuals by three patterns of sexual activity:
*Inactive group (44%): sexually inactive
*Avoidant group (19%): sexually active but avoided using their penis
*Pleasure group (37%): sexually active and derived pleasure from their penis
Each group showed varying levels of masculinity and emotional disturbance in development.<ref name="leavitt1990"/>

In ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', [[J. Michael Bailey]] saw that the homosexual transsexuals he described were comfortable with [[prostitution]],<ref name="bailey2003">{{cite web|author=Bailey JM|date=2003|url=http://www.barkingduck.net/ehayes/essays/transsexualism.html|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism|work=Women Who Once Were Boys Joseph Henry Press, ISBN 0-309-08418-0}}</ref> and that they had a masculine sexual appetite and simply lusted after men.<ref name="bailey2003"/>

Studies have variously found that between 10% and 36% of homosexual transsexuals report a history of sexual arousal to crossdressing. Bentler found 23%, while Freund reported 31%;<ref name="bentler1976">Bentler P M (1976). A typology of transsexualism: Gender identity theory and data.

Some scientific concerns have also been raised; a purported transgendered psychologist writing under the pen name of Madeline Wyndzen identified four possible scientific concerns with Blanchard's model which center around lack of control groups, independant verification, statistical analysis, and supposing causation from non time sensitive observation.<ref name="wyndzen2004">{{cite web|author=Wyndzen MH|date=2004|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/DIV44/APA-DIV44%20Spring-04%20Article.htm|title=A Personal & Scientific look at a Mental Illness Model of transsexualism|work=Division 44 Newsletter, v.20(1), 3|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]}}</ref> Wyndzen is concerned that Blanchard's research promotes the politically and socially dangerous idea that transsexual people are mentally defective: "Rather than asking the scientifically neutral question, <U+201C>What is transgenderism?<U+201D> Blanchard (1991) asks, "What kind of defect in a male's capacity for sexual learning could produce&nbsp;<U+2026> autogynephilia, transvestitism <U+2026>?" (p. 246)."<ref name="wyndzen2004"/> 

On the other hand in a study conducted in 2005 in the Netherlands Yolanda Smith conducted a study which addressed many of Wyndzen's criticisms.<ref name="psychology Research"/>  She found that Blanchards observations were replicated in her sample.  Smith found that homosexual transsexuals differed from non-homosexual transsexuals in terms of reported gender non conformity and fewer had been married.<ref name="psychology Research"/> She did not find the difference in height,weight, and height weight ratio that Blanchard reported.<ref name="psychology Research"/>
