'''U.S. Route 27''' ('''US&nbsp;27''') is a north&ndash;south [[United States highway]] in the southern and midwestern [[United States]]. The southern terminus is at [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US&nbsp;1]] in [[Miami, Florida]]. The northern terminus is at [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] (I-69) in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].<ref name="termini">{{cite web|url=http://usends.com/20-29/027/027.html|title=Endpoints of U.S. highways|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> From [[Miami]] it goes up the center of [[Florida]], then west to [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], Florida, and north through such cities and towns as [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], Georgia; [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]], Georgia; [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], Tennessee;  [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], Kentucky; [[Cincinnati]], Ohio; [[Oxford, Ohio|Oxford]], Ohio; [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], Indiana; and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], Indiana.  It once extended north through [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], Michigan, to [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]], [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]], and for about 3&nbsp;years as far as [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]].

US&nbsp;27 appeared in 1926, replacing what had been the western route of the [[Dixie Highway]] in many places.

==Route description==

===Florida===
{{main|U.S. Route 27 in Florida}}
[[Image:US 27 (FL).svg|70px|thumb|left|A US 27 shield used in Florida prior to 1993]]
In [[Florida]], US 27 has been designated the '''Claude Pepper Memorial Highway''' by the Florida State Legislature. It was named after long-time Florida [[United States Senate|US Senator]] and congressman [[Claude Pepper]]. Nearly the entire length of US&nbsp;27 in Florida is a divided highway.

US&nbsp;27 begins as North 36th Street in [[Midtown Miami|Midtown]] [[Miami]], heading west from US&nbsp;1 for {{convert|4.4|mi|km}} before turning northwest to pass under the western terminus of the [[Florida State Road 112|Airport Expressway]] (State Road 112, SR&nbsp;112). It then proceeds northwest for five miles (8&nbsp;km) as South Okeechobee Road, parallel to the [[Miami Canal]], forming the southwest boundary of the city of [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]].  After an interchange with the [[Florida State Road 826|Palmetto Expressway]] (SR&nbsp;826), it continues northwest as North Okeechobee Road for five miles (8&nbsp;km) before an interchange with the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike|Homestead Extension of the Florida Turnpike]] (SR 821).  After another four miles (6&nbsp;km), the highway curves to the north and, after passing the northern terminus of [[Florida State Road 997|Krome Avenue]] (SR&nbsp;997), crosses into [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]].

[[File:US 27 near I-75 south01.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;27, looking south towards the I-75 interchange]]
In Broward County, the highway passes protected wetlands and heavy duty power lines on the west and the outer reaches of the suburban communities of [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|Pembroke Pines]] and [[Weston, Florida|Weston]] on the east. US&nbsp;27 then reaches an interchange with [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] and [[Alligator Alley]] before curving to the northwest toward [[South Bay, Florida|South Bay]] and [[Lake Okeechobee]].

The highway skirts the southwestern shore of Lake Okeechobee and then heads west at [[Clewiston, Florida|Clewiston]], before making a sharp turn to the north towards [[Moore Haven, Florida|Moore Haven]].  The road then proceeds in a northerly direction toward the central Florida communities of [[Lake Placid, Florida|Lake Placid]], [[Sebring, Florida|Sebring]], [[Avon Park, Florida|Avon Park]], and [[Lake Wales, Florida|Lake Wales]].

Widening of US&nbsp;27 to a six-lane highway continues in Polk County.  The following sections have been completed and are open to six lanes of traffic:
*SR&nbsp;60 to SR 540 in Lake Wales
*SR&nbsp;542 in Dundee to north of I-4 in Davenport

North of I-4, US&nbsp;27 contains un-numbered interchanges with [[U.S. Route 192|US&nbsp;192]] and then [[County Road 474 (Lake County, Florida)|County Road 474]] (CR&nbsp;474) in Citrus Ridge, [[Florida State Road 50|SR&nbsp;50]] in Clermont, and [[Florida State Road 19|SR 19]] south of [[Howey-in-the-Hills, Florida|Howey-in-the-Hills]], which also includes a southbound interchange with [[Florida's Turnpike]]. The northbound Turnpike interchange can be found further northwest. [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|US&nbsp;441]] later joins US&nbsp;27 in [[Leesburg, Florida|Leesburg]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in Florida|US&nbsp;301]] in [[Belleview, Florida|Belleview]], only for the road to break away from both in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]].

US&nbsp;27 resumes its status as its own route until it reaches Williston and joins [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US&nbsp;41]]. This concurrency continues northward until US&nbsp;41 reaches [[High Springs, Florida|High Springs]], and joins US&nbsp;441. US&nbsp;27 heads west along the [[Florida State Road 20|unsigned SR&nbsp;20]] towards [[Perry, Florida|Perry]] and joins [[U.S. Route 19 in Florida|US&nbsp;19]] until US&nbsp;19 breaks away in [[Capps, Florida|Capps]], but not before resuming a westward direction. In [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], the road becomes Apalachee Parkway, a major east<U+2013>west thoroughfare. Constructed in 1957, the Apalachee Parkway starts at [[State Road 61 (Florida)|Monroe Street]] in front of the [[Florida State Capitol]] building. It has a short expressway section just east of the capitol, then is a busy four-lane surface boulevard with [[service road]]s for the next few miles, passing the [[Governor's Square|Governor's Square Mall]] and many state office buildings. Past Tallahassee, US&nbsp;27 finally resumes its northwesterly direction. The highway goes through [[Havana, Florida|Havana]] before entering Georgia.

===Georgia===
{{main|U.S. Route 27 in Georgia}}

In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], US&nbsp;27 has been designated the '''Martha Berry Highway''' by the Georgia State Legislature.  It was named after [[Martha Berry]], founder of [[Berry College]] in [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]]. US&nbsp;27 is a designated Governor's Road Improvement Program (GRIP) developmental highway corridor which will eventually be widened to four lanes (mostly divided) from the Florida state line to the Tennessee state line. All of US&nbsp;27 in Georgia is concurrent with Georgia State Route 1.

===Tennessee===
In [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], a portion of US&nbsp;27 was once signed as [[Interstate 124|I-124]]. Though the designation still exists, it is no longer signed as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-124_tn.html|title=Interstate 124 Tennessee @ Interstate-Guide.com|accessdate=September 28, 2007}}</ref> In and around the [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] area, US&nbsp;27 is sometimes referred to as [[Corridor J (Appalachian Development Highway System)|Corridor J]], the designation of a road in the [[Appalachian Development Highway System]] between Chattanooga and [[London, Kentucky|London]], Kentucky intended to follow the route of US&nbsp;27.

From Chattanooga, the highway passes through [[Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee|Soddy-Daisy]] and the small communities of [[Sale Creek, Tennessee|Sale Creek]] and [[Graysville, Tennessee|Graysville]] before reaching [[Dayton, Tennessee|Dayton]], the site of the infamous [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]]. It then passes through [[Evensville, Tennessee|Evensville]] before arriving at [[Spring City, Tennessee|Spring City]].

From here, US&nbsp;27 enters [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]], running concurrent with [[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]] going through the city of [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]]. After US&nbsp;70 splits to the east, US&nbsp;27 runs concurrent with [[Tennessee State Route 61|State Route 61]] (SR&nbsp;61) through [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]], where it is crossed by [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. During this stretch, it forms part of the [[Harvey H. Hannah]] Memorial Highway, and is signed as such.

In [[Morgan County, Tennessee|Morgan County]], the highway passes through [[Wartburg, Tennessee|Wartburg]] and [[Sunbright, Tennessee|Sunbright]].
It passes through [[Robbins, Tennessee|Robbins]] and [[Helenwood, Tennessee|Helenwood]] before reaching [[Oneida, Tennessee|Oneida]] in [[Scott County, Tennessee|Scott County]].

[[Winfield, Tennessee|Winfield]] is the last sizable town that US&nbsp;27 passes through in Tennessee before it reaches the community of [[Isham, Tennessee|Isham]] on the [[Kentucky]] border.

===Kentucky===
[[File:Falmouth KY USA.JPG|thumb| U.S. Route 27 in Falmouth, Kentucky.]]
US&nbsp;27 enters Kentucky near [[Whitley City, Kentucky|Whitley City]].  The first major town it goes through is [[Somerset, Kentucky|Somerset]], followed by Stanford, Lancaster, [[Nicholasville, Kentucky|Nicholasville]], and [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], where it begins a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 68|US&nbsp;68]] that continues to [[Paris, Kentucky|Paris]].  US&nbsp;27 continues north from there through [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]], [[Falmouth, Kentucky|Falmouth]], [[Alexandria, Kentucky|Alexandria]], [[Highland Heights, Kentucky|Highland Heights]], [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky|Fort Thomas]], and [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]] before crossing into [[Ohio]] at [[Cincinnati]] via [[Taylor-Southgate Bridge]].  From its junction with [[Interstate 471]] in Highland Heights through Campbell County, it is a four-lane highway with a center turn lane for both directions of traffic. Near the "welcome to Alexandria" sign at [[Kentucky State Route 536|KY 536]], US&nbsp;27 becomes a divided four-lane highway with a grass median. It is currently being constructed as such for the rest of its length from 536 through southern Campbell county. Currently, US&nbsp;27 is under-going  a widening project near Garrard CR&nbsp;1355 to HWY 34. The road will become a four lane into Lexington.

===Ohio===

US&nbsp;27 crosses into [[Cincinnati]] via the [[Taylor<U+2013>Southgate Bridge]]. The road continues Northwest from [[Oxford, Ohio|Oxford]] until reaching the [[Indiana]] border at [[College Corner, Ohio|College Corner]].

===Indiana===
{{main|U.S. Route 27 in Indiana}}
[[Image:US 27 northern terminus, looking south, Fort Wayne, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|Looking south at the northern terminus of U.S. 27 in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], Indiana.]]

US&nbsp;27 enters the southeastern part of Indiana south of the town of [[Liberty, Indiana|Liberty]].  At Liberty, US&nbsp;27 turns north, paralleling the Ohio state line.  It intersects [[Interstate 70|I-70]] at [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], Indiana, and continues north to [[Decatur, Indiana|Decatur]].  [[U.S. Route 33|US&nbsp;33]] joins US&nbsp;27 just south of Decatur and the two routes share a northwesterly alignment on a divided surface highway from Decatur to [[Interstate 469|I-469]] south of Fort Wayne.  US&nbsp;33 turns west and follows I-469, while US&nbsp;27 continues north into downtown Fort Wayne as Clinton Street.  North of downtown, US&nbsp;27 follows Lima Road to its terminus at [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]]/[[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]] (Lima Road continues north from this point as [[Indiana State Road 3|SR&nbsp;3]]).

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
[[Image:Old US 27 (MI).jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;27 no longer exists in Michigan. It has been replaced by I-69, I-75, and US&nbsp;127.]]
Originally, the southern terminus of US&nbsp;27 was in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]. In 1928, the route was extended south to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], Tennessee, then to [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], Florida in 1934. In 1949, it was extended to its current terminus in Miami. At its northern end, US&nbsp;27 originally terminated at [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]], Michigan. In 1937, the route was extended concurrently with [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]] to [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]], where it ended at the Michigan State Auto Ferry Dock along with US 23 and [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]]. After the completion of the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in 1957, US&nbsp;27 was extended across the bridge to the current intersection of [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] and [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]] near [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]]. In 1961, what became I-75 was completed, enabling the roadway to be designated as I-75. At the same time, US&nbsp;27 was truncated to an interchange with I-75 six miles (10&nbsp;km) south of [[Grayling, Michigan|Grayling]]. In 2002, the northern terminus was moved to its current location.

From Grayling to [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] near [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], the road is now designated [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US&nbsp;127]]. US&nbsp;27 signs were removed from I-69 between Lansing and Fort Wayne in 2001. Officially, the current northern terminus is at the junction of I-69, US&nbsp;30, and SR&nbsp;3, but heading north on I-69 one will still see US&nbsp;27 shields on some of the older overhead signs heading to the I-469 interchange on the northern edge of Fort Wayne.<ref name="michhist">{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/HistoricUS-027.html|title=Historic US&nbsp;27|publisher=Michigan Highways|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref>

===Indiana===
On March 9, 2007, legislation was introduced in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] to designate US&nbsp;27 as historic highway.  [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], one of the cities US&nbsp;27 passes through, would have two historic highways passing through it.  The original [[National Road]] ([[U.S. Route 40 in Indiana|US&nbsp;40]]) runs through Richmond.

===Michigan===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
{{main|U.S. Route 27 in Michigan}}
US&nbsp;27 was one of the highways in Michigan to carry the TEMP I-75 designation when I-75 was being constructed along then [[M-76 (Michigan highway)|M-76]].

The at-grade routing of US&nbsp;27 in Michigan has been largely superseded by I-75, which follows a roughly similar route and in some places actually replaced the older highway. From Lansing north to I-75, the former US&nbsp;27 is now US&nbsp;127; from Lansing south to Fort Wayne, US&nbsp;27 was replaced by I-69. In many places the route markers and the highway itself serve to connect local communities bypassed by the [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]].
