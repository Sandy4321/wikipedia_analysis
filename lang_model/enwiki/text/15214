'''''Davidsonia''''' is a genus containing three [[rainforest]] tree species, that are commonly known as the '''Davidson''' or '''Davidson's Plum'''. The fruits superficially resemble the European plum, but are not closely related. All species have an edible sour fruit with burgundy coloured flesh and are highly regarded as gourmet [[bushfood]].

*''[[Davidsonia jerseyana]]'', Davidson's Plum or Mullumbimby Plum, is a slender small tree, generally 5 m. high, native to lowland subtropical rainforests of New South Wales. It is considered an endangered species in the wild, but is widely cultivated for its pleasantly sour fruit that is used in jam, wine, ice-cream and sauces.

*''[[Davidsonia johnsonii]]'', Smooth Davidson's Plum, is small tree with a spreading canopy, and smooth leaves native to New South Wales and southeast Queensland. It is also considered an endangered species in the wild, but is not widely cultivated as a result of infertile seeds. It is propagated vegetatively from cutting or root division.

*''[[Davidsonia pruriens]]'', North Queensland Davidson's Plum, is a taller tree than the other two species. It is also slender and has larger fruit which are produced in large clusters from the trunk.

Small-scale plantations in New South Wales and Queensland supply the demand, mainly from ''Davidsonia jerseyana'' and ''Davidsonia pruriens''.
