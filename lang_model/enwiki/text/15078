[[Image:Peterloo Massacre.png|thumb|right|300px|A painting of the Peterloo Massacre published by [[Richard Carlile]].]]

The '''Peterloo Massacre''' of [[August 16]] [[1819]] was the result of a [[cavalry]] [[Charge (warfare)|charge]] into the crowd at a public assembly at St Peter's Fields, [[Manchester]], [[England]]. It is also called the '''Manchester Massacre''' or sometimes the '''Battle of Peterloo'''. Of the 60,000 strong crowd, 15 people were killed and over 600 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo by sympathisers who compared it to the [[Battle of Waterloo]].

The meeting was called to protest against [[corn laws]] and the inequitable parliamentary representation of the early 19th century, which had resulted in the majority of [[Members of Parliament]] being elected by 154 voters, whereas almost one&nbsp;million people in [[Lancashire]] were unrepresented. A majority of those attending the meeting at Peterloo were not from Manchester, but from the surrounding towns. The Rev. W. R. Hay, Charman of the Salford Quarter Sessions, said "The active part of the meeting may be said to have come in wholly from the country".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;33.</ref>

The massacre was one of the [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s greatest social upheavals and a key event in [[History of Manchester|Manchester's history]], and led directly to the foundation of the ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]''. The event is commemorated by a plaque close to the site of the massacre, which has been criticised as being inadequate. In a survey conducted by ''The Guardian'' in 2006, Peterloo came second as the event from [[History of the United Kingdom|British history]] that most deserved a monument or memorial.

== Background ==
At [[general election]]s the vote in Britain was restricted to [[Fee simple|freeholders]] and landowners, in constituencies that were out of date, so that in many so called "[[rotten borough]]s", seats could be bought while major cities remained unrepresented.{{fact}} There were huge differences between the influence of districts over the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The "Rotten boroughs" had a huge influence over the government compared with the size of their population, for example the borough of [[Old Sarum]] in [[Wiltshire]], with 7 voters, could elect 2 [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to parliament, as could the borough of [[Dunwich]] in [[Suffolk]], which had completely disappeared into the sea due to [[coastal erosion]].{{fact}} The major urban centres of [[Manchester]], [[Salford]], [[Bolton]], [[Blackburn]], [[Rochdale]], [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Oldham]], and [[Stockport]] with a combined population of almost one&nbsp;million did not have a single MP to represent them.<ref>Reid (1989), p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Even though [[Lancashire]] had grown in population, wealth and commercial influence, its people had no opportunity to elect an MP. Reformers increasingly sought parliamentary representation.

After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, a brief boom in [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacture]] was followed by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners.<ref name="FrangopuloP30"/> Weavers who could have expected to earn 15 [[Shilling (United Kingdom)|shillings]] for a 6-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5 shillings or even 4s 6[[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|d]] by 1818.<ref name="HernonP22">Hernon (2006), pp.&nbsp;22.</ref> The industrialists cutting wages without offering relief cited markets forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars.<ref name="HernonP22" /> By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by the depression was at its peak, and increased the appeal of [[Radicalism (historical)|political Radicalism]] among the cotton loom weavers of south Lancashire as a way of increasing their influence on parliament.<ref name="FrangopuloP30">Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;30.</ref>

==Assembly==
[[Image:Peterloo contingents map.png|thumb|right|A majority of those attending the meeting at Peterloo were not from Manchester, but the surrounding townships.]]
In response to poor social and working conditions, coupled with the lack of sufferage in [[Northern England]], a "great assembly" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union Society, a political group agitating for radical parliamentary reform and the repeal of the [[corn laws]] which were forcing food prices up.{{fact}} [[Richard Carlile]], [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|John Cartwright]] and [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]] were among the speakers invited.{{fact}}

[[Samuel Bamford]], a local radical writer who led the [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] contingent to the assembly, wrote that "It was deemed expedient that this meeting should be as morally effective as possible, and, that it should exhibit a spectable such as had never before been witnessed in England".<ref name="FrangopuloP30"/> Bamford, aware that "We had frequently been taunted by the press, with our ragged, dirty appearance, at these assemblages" was determined that "these relections should not be deserved" on 16 August 1819.<ref name="FrangopuloP30"/> Likewise, instructions were given to the various committes forming the contingents that "Cleanliness, Sobriety, Order and Peace" and a "prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence" were to be observed throughout the [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]].<ref>Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;31.</ref>

Local magistrates, under William Hulton, were concerned that the meeting would end in a riot or, worse, a rebellion. They arranged for a substantial number of militia [[yeomanry]], described as "younger members of the [[Tory party]] in arms", who were ordered to disperse the meeting.<ref name = 'G'/> The troops included 600 men of the [[15th Hussars]]; several hundred infantrymen; a [[Royal Horse Artillery]] unit with two six-pounder (2.7 kg) guns; 400 men of the Cheshire Yeomanry; 400 [[special constable]]s; and 120 cavalry of the Manchester Yeomanry, relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among shopkeepers and tradesmen.{{fact}}

A crowd from Manchester and its surrounding townships had gathered for the meeting; contemporary estimates varied from 30,000 up to 150,000; modern estimates are around 60,000 or 80,000.{{fact}} People expected a peaceful meeting and many were wearing their Sunday clothes.{{clarifyme}}{{fact}} Some carried banners with texts like "No [[Corn Laws]]", "Annual Parliaments", "[[Universal suffrage]]" and "Vote By Ballot." The only banner known to have survived can be seen in Middleton Public Library.{{fact}} It was carried by Thomas Redford who was injured by a yeomanry sabre. One side of the banner is inscribed 'Liberty and Fraternity' and the other 'Unity and Strength'. The main speakers did not arrive until after 1:00&nbsp;pm, and Hunt was invited to speak first at 1:15&nbsp;pm.{{fact}}

==Charge==
[[Image:The Massacre of Peterloo.jpg|thumb|right|A caricature by [[George Cruikshank]] depicting the charge upon the rally]]
At around 1:31&nbsp;pm the magistrates observing the meeting decided to stop it. When the reading of the [[Riot Act]] did not help, they gave orders to Captain Joseph Nadin, Deputy Constable of Manchester, to arrest the leaders. Nadin requested military aid and magistrates sent for the Manchester Yeomanry.{{fact}}

Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester Yeomanry, possibly drunk,<ref>Reid (1989, p.&nbsp;156.</ref> entered the field with Captain [[Hugh Hornby Birley]] at their head, brandishing their sabres and charging towards the cart that served as the speakers' stand. When some demonstrators tried to stop them by linking their hands, they began to attack them with their sabres. When the cavalry reached the cart, they arrested Hunt, Joseph Johnson and a number of others, including some journalists.{{fact}}

The yeomanry then began to strike down the flags and banners of the crowd with their sabres. Outside the field William Hulton perceived the crowd's actions as an assault and ordered Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange of the hussars into the field at 1:50&nbsp;pm, ostensibly to save the yeomanry. Within ten minutes the hussars had cleared the field and pacified the yeomanry.{{fact}}

Eleven people were killed on the day, and four others subsequently died from wounds received.{{fact}} Over 600, including 100 women, were injured, many trampled by horses. One man had his nose severed, and others suffered from numerous sabre cuts.{{fact}}

== Reaction and aftermath ==
Many of those present, including local masters, employers and owners, were horrified by the carnage. Sympathetic Richard Carlile avoided arrest and published the story in his ''Sherwin's Political Register''. British poet [[Percy Shelley|Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote the poems ''England in 1819'' and ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' in the immediate aftermath of the massacre.

The name "Peterloo" was coined immediately by the radical ''Manchester Observer'', combining the name of the meeting place, St Peter's Fields, with the [[Battle of Waterloo]] fought four years earlier. Its immediate result was a crackdown on reform, but it proved influential in the longer run.<ref name = 'G'>{{cite web |title=Battle for the memory of Peterloo: Campaigners demand fitting tribute |last=Wainwright |first=Martin |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd. |date=2007-08-13 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/aug/13/britishidentity.artnews |accessdate=2008-03-26}}</ref> The incident led to the formation of ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper in 1821 by a group of [[non-conformist]] Manchester businessmen headed by [[John Edward Taylor]], a witness to the massacre.<ref name = 'G'/> The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that "it will zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty <U+2026> it will warmly advocate the cause of Reform; it will endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy; and to support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures."{{fact}}

The government supported the action of the army and magistrates, and the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]], congratulated them. For a few months following Peterloo it seemed to the authorities that an armed rebellion was threatening. Confirming them in their belief were two abortive uprisings, in Huddersfield and Burnley, during the autumn of 1819, and the discovery and foiling of the [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] to blow up the cabinet the following winter.<ref>{{cite web |title="By the Law or the Sword": Peterloo revisited |last=Poole |first=Robert |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-229X.2006.00366.x?cookieSet=1 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> By the end of the year, the government had introduced legislation, later known as the [[Six Acts]], to suppress [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] meetings and publications, and by the end of 1820 every significant working-class radical reformer was in jail; civil liberties had declined to an even lower level than they were before Peterloo. Historian Robert Reid has written that "it is not fanciful to compare the restricted freedoms of the British worker in the post-Peterloo period in the early nineteenth century with those of the black South African in the post-Sharpeville period of the late twentieth century".<ref>Reid (1987), p.&nbsp;211.</ref>

Hunt and eight others were tried at York Assizes on [[16 March]] [[1820]], charged with sedition. After a two-week trial, five of the ten defendants were found guilty. Hunt was sentenced to 30&nbsp;months in [[Ilchester]] Jail; Bamford, Johnson, and Healey were given one year each, and Knight was jailed for two years on a subsequent charge. A test case was brought against four members of the Manchester Yeomanry at Lancaster Assizes, on [[4 April]] [[1822]]: Captain Birley, Captain Withington, Trumpeter Meagher, and Private Oliver. All were acquitted, as the court ruled that their actions had been justified to disperse an illegal gathering.<ref>Reid (1989), pp.&nbsp;203&ndash;204.</ref>

In 1832, following the [[Great Reform Act]], Manchester elected its first MPs since the election of 1656. Five candidates including [[William Cobbett]] stood, and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]s [[Charles Poulett Thomson]] and [[Mark Philips]] were elected.{{fact}} The act led to conditions favourable to [[municipal incorporation]], and Manchester became a [[Municipal Borough]] in 1837. What remained of the [[manorial rights]] were later purchased by the town council. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834]] reformed the country's [[social security|poverty relief system]].

== Commemoration ==
[[Image:Peterloo plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Original blue plaque commemorating the Peterloo Massacre.]]
Until 2007 the site of the massacre was commemorated by a [[blue plaque]] on the wall of what was the [[Free Trade Hall]], now the Radisson Hotel. It was inscribed:
{{quote|The site of St Peter's Fields where on 16th August 1819 Henry Hunt, Radical Orator addressed an assembly of about 60,000 people. Their subsequent dispersal by the military is remembered as Peterloo.<ref>{{cite web |title=From Peterloo To The Pankhursts: A Radical Politics Trail |last=Moss |first=Richard |date=2004-11-21 |publisher=24 Hour Museum |url=http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/trlout_gfx_en/TRA25555.html |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>}}

A growing body of opinion regarded that as a less-than-appropriate memorial, with the incident being under-reported as a dispersal and the deaths being omitted completely.<ref name = 'G'>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/news/story/0,,2147877,00.html Battle for the memory of Peterloo: Campaigners demand fitting tribute] Guardian online</ref> In a 2006 survey conducted by ''The Guardian'', Peterloo came second to [[St. Mary's Church, Putney]], the venue for the [[Putney Debates]], as the event from British history that most deserved a proper monument.<ref>{{cite web |title=And the winner is ... |last=Hunt |first=Tristram |coauthors=Fraser, Giles |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd. |location=London | date=2006-10-16 |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1923303,00.html |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> In 2007, [[Manchester City Council]] replaced the original blue plaque with a red one, giving a more complete account of the events of 1819. It was unveiled on [[10 December]] [[2007]] by Cllr.

British composer [[Malcolm Arnold|Sir Malcolm Arnold]] wrote the ''Peterloo Overture'' in 1968, a work commissioned by the [[Trades Union Congress]]. It was performed in 1969, the 150th anniversary of the massacre. Other musical commemorations include ''Ned Ludd Part 5'' on [[electric folk]] group [[Steeleye Span]]'s album [[Bloody Men (album)|Bloody Men]], and [[Rochdale]] rock band [[Tractor (band)|Tractor]]'s suite of five songs written and recorded in 1973, later included on their 1992 release ''Worst Enemies''.

The Peterloo Massacre forms the opening of [[Emma Darwin (novelist)|Emma Darwin]]'s novel ''The Mathematics of Love''; it also forms a backdrop for the 1947 film ''Fame is the Spur'' (based on [[Howard Spring]]'s [[Fame is the Spur|1940 novel of the same name]]). Though never mentioned by name, the massacre is described in a [[flashback]]; the film's hero receives a sabre supposedly taken from one of the hussars.
