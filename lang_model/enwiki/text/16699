'''Cleveland''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|k|l|i<U+02D0>|v|l|<U+0259>n|d}}) is a [[city]] in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]],{{GR|6}} the most populous county in the state. The city is located in northeastern Ohio on the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]], approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} west of the [[Pennsylvania]] border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the [[Cuyahoga River]], and became a [[manufacturing]] center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous [[canal]]s and [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad]] lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, [[Health care in the United States|healthcare]], and biomedical.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cleveland}}
Cleveland obtained its name on July 22, 1796 when surveyors of the [[Connecticut Land Company]] laid out [[Connecticut]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] into townships and a capital city they named "Cleaveland" after their leader, General [[Moses Cleaveland]]. Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on [[Public Square]], before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was [[Lorenzo Carter]], who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/timeline.html | title = Cleveland: A Bicentennial Timeline | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref>
In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. This key link between the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] connected the city to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Erie Canal]] and later via the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]; and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]. Growth continued with added railroad links.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=OAEC | title = Ohio and Erie Canal | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref> Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.<ref name="Timeline"/>
[[File:Cleveland 1877.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bird's-eye view]] of Cleveland in 1877]]
In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring [[Ohio City (Cuyahoga County), Ohio|Ohio City]] over a bridge connecting the two.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CSB | title = Columbus Street Bridge | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref> Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexation]] by Cleveland in 1854.<ref name="Timeline" />

The city's prime geographic location as transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played a role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland serves as a destination point for [[iron ore]] shipped from [[Minnesota]], as well as [[coal]] transported by rail. In 1870, [[John D. Rockefeller]] founded [[Standard Oil]] in Cleveland, and moved its headquarters to [[New York City]] in 1885.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html | title = Rockefellers Timeline | accessdate = July 7, 2010 | date = 1999<U+2013>2000 | publisher = PBS | quote = 1870 Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1 million in capital, the largest corporation in the country.

By 1920, due in large part to the city's economic prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|largest city]].<ref name="Timeline"/> The city counted [[Progressive Era]] politicians such as the [[Populism|populist]] Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson]] among its leaders. Many prominent Clevelanders from this era are buried in the historic [[Lake View Cemetery]], including [[President of the United States|President]] [[James A. Garfield]],<ref>[[Find A Grave]]: [http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page=cem&FScemeteryid=41762 Lake View Cemetery.] Findagrave.com. Retrieved on 2007-05-09.</ref> and John D. Rockefeller.

In commemoration of the [[centennial]] of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the [[Great Lakes Exposition]] debuted in June 1936 along the [[Lake Erie]] shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the [[Great Depression]], it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=GLE | title = Great Lakes Exposition | publisher = The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref> The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Burke Lakefront Airport]], among others.<ref>{{cite book | author = Porter, Philip |url = http://www.clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/Chapt06.html |title = Cleveland: Confused City on a Seesaw | chapter = Chapter 6 | pages = 106<U+2013>107 | year = 1976 | location = Columbus, Ohio | publisher = Ohio State University Press | isbn= 0-8142-0264-0 | accessdate= July 22, 2009 }}</ref>
Following [[World War II]], the city experienced a prosperous economy. In sports, the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] won the [[1948 World Series]] and the [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] dominated professional [[National Football League|football]] in the 1950s.

During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, Cleveland witnessed social unrest, culminating in the [[Hough Riots]] from July 18, 1966 <U+2013> July 23, 1966 and the [[Glenville Shootout]] from July 23, 1968 <U+2013> July 25, 1968. In December 1978, Cleveland became the first major American city to enter into a [[default (finance)|financial default]] on federal loans since the Great Depression.<ref name="Timeline"/> Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s, when financial difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the city.  This, along with the city's struggling professional sports teams, drew negative national press; as a result, Cleveland was often derided as "The Mistake on the Lake".<ref>{{cite web |date=September 10, 2007 |title=Cleveland: A Midwestern Rustbelt City Struggles to Sur(Re)vive url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/cscr/seminars/Keating.doc |first=Dennis |last=Keating |location=Cleveland, Ohio }}</ref>

===Climate===
Cleveland possesses a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), typical of much of the central United States, with very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the [[lake effect snow]] that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} of snowfall in a season three times since 1968,<ref>[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/climate/cle/records/cletop10snow.html Cleveland Snowfalle (sic) Statistics.] [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on 2005-10-13.</ref> seasonal totals approaching or exceeding {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the '[[Snowbelt|Snow Belt]]' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt up the Lake Erie shore as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

The all-time record high in Cleveland of {{convert|104|F|0}} was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of {{convert|-20|F|0}} was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of {{convert|73.5|F|1}}, and January, with a mean temperature of {{convert|28.1|F|1}}, is the coldest. Normal yearly [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010 is {{convert|39.14|in|mm|0}}.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=cle NOWData <U+2013> NOAA Online Weather Data.] National Weather Service.

[[File:ClevelandSkyline.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] at Cleveland's [[North Coast Harbor]].]]
Cleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the [[Cuyahoga County Courthouse]], the [[Cleveland Public Library]], and [[Public Auditorium]], are clustered around an open [[The Mall (Cleveland)|mall]] and share a common [[neoclassical architecture]]. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 [[Group Plan]], and constitute one of the most complete examples of [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] design in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Michael |title=Make No Little Plans |year=1980 |pages=20<U+2013>25 |publisher=[[Western Reserve Historical Society]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |isbn=0-911704-24-8}}</ref> The [[Terminal Tower]], dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside [[New York City]] until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991.<ref>{{cite book |author=Toman, James and Cook, Daniel |title=Cleveland's Towering Treasure |year=2005 |chapter=The Tower |page=76 |publisher=Cleveland Landmarks Press |location=Cleveleand, Ohio |isbn=0-936760-20-6}}</ref> It is a prototypical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[skyscraper]].

City leaders stepped up efforts to grow the technology sector in the first decade of the 21st century. Former Mayor [[Jane L.

[[Cleveland State University]] hired a Technology Transfer Officer to work full time on cultivating technology transfers from CSU research to marketable ideas and companies in the Cleveland area, and appointed a Vice President for Economic Development to leverage the university's assets in expanding the city's economy.

===Freeways===
Three two-digit [[Interstate highway]]s serve Cleveland directly. [[Interstate 71]] begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Cincinnati]]. [[Interstate 77]] begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. [[Interstate 90]] connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east<U+2013>west through the west side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as [[Dead Man's Curve]], then continues northeast, entering [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]] near the eastern split with [[Ohio State Route 2]]. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|Interstate 480]], which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and [[Interstate 490 (Ohio)|Interstate 490]], which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.<ref>[http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-490_oh.html Interstate 490 Cleveland.] Interstate-Guide.com. Retrieved on 2007-07-22.</ref> <!-- Please do not add I-271 here, since it does not run through the City of Cleveland. Instead, please include any relevant information in the Greater Cleveland article. -->

Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] carries [[Ohio State Route 2|State Route 2]] along its length, and at varying points also carries [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]], [[U.S. Route 20|US 20]] and I-90.
