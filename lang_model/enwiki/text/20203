'''Hummingbirds''' are small [[bird]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Trochilidae'''. They are known for their ability to hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their [[wing]]s, 15 to 80 times per second (depending on the species).The Giant Hummingbird<U+2019>s wings beat 8-10 beats per second, the medium sized hummingbird<U+2019>s wings beat about 20-25 beats per second and the smallest beat 70 beats per second. Capable of sustained hovering, the hummingbird has the ability to fly deliberately backwards or vertically, and to maintain position while drinking from flower blossoms. They are named for the characteristic [[hum (sound)|hum]] made by their wings.

Hummingbirds are attracted to many [[flower]]ing plants&mdash;[[shrimp plant]]s, ''[[Heliconia]]'', [[bromeliad]]s, [[Canna (plant)|cannas]], [[verbena]]s, [[fuchsia]]s, many [[penstemon]]s&mdash;especially those with [[red]] flowers. They feed on the [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] of these plants and are important [[pollinator]]s, especially of deep-throated flowers. Most species of hummingbird also take [[insect]]s, especially when feeding young.

The [[Bee Hummingbird]] (''Mellisuga helenae'') is the smallest bird in the world, weighing 1.8 [[gram]]s (0.06 ounces). A more typical hummingbird, such as the [[Rufous Hummingbird]] (''Selasphorus rufus''), weighs approximately 3 g (0.106 ounces) and has a length of 10-12 cm (3.5-4 inches).  The largest hummingbird is the [[Giant Hummingbird]] (''Patagona gigas''), with some individuals weighing as much as 24 grams (0.85 ounces).

Most male hummingbirds take no part in nesting. Most species make a neatly woven cup in a tree branch. Two white eggs are laid, which despite being the smallest of all bird eggs, are in fact large relative to the hummingbird's adult size. [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] is typically 14-19 days.

==Appearance==
[[Image:Male Ruby-Throated Hummingbird 1.jpg|thumb|250px|A male [[Ruby-throated Hummingbird]].]]
The hummingbird is a small bird with a long, thin beak. This elongated beak is one of the defining characteristics of the hummingbird, which, with an extendable, [[bifurcated]] [[tongue]], has [[evolution|evolved]] in order to allow the bird to feed upon [[nectar]] deep within flowers. 

Hummingbirds vary in size. The smallest hummingbird, the [[bee hummingbird]], weighs less than 2 g, while [[giant hummingbird]]s weigh 19 to 21 g. Most species, however, weigh 2.5 to 6.5 g and are 6 to 12 cm in length. 
Hummingbirds bear the most glittering [[plumage]] in the bird world. They display [[sexual dimorphism]], as male hummingbirds are usually more brightly coloured, while females of most species display more [[cryptic coloration]].<ref>http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Trochilidae.html</ref>  
Most males have [[iridescent]] plumage, in metallic red, orange, green and/or blue. Some have only an iridescent throat patch or cap, while others, such as the [[Coppery-headed Emerald]] are entirely iridescent.<ref>http://www.montereybay.com/creagrus/hummingbirds.html</ref> 

==Aerodynamics of flight==

Discovered after training a bird to fly through a cloud of neutrally buoyant helium-filled soap bubbles and recording airflows in the wake with [[stereo photography]].<ref>Rayner, J.M.V. 1995. Dynamics of vortex wakes of flying and swimming vertebrates. ''J. Exp. Biol.'' 49:131-155.</ref>]]
Hummingbird flight has been studied intensively from an [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] perspective: [[Hover]]ing hummingbirds may be filmed using high-speed [[video camera]]s.

Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[biophysics|biomechanist]] [[Douglas Warrick]] and coworkers studied the [[Rufous Hummingbird]], ''Selasphorus rufus'', in a [[wind tunnel]] using [[particle image velocimetry]] techniques and investigated the lift generated on the bird's upstroke and downstroke.

They concluded that their subjects produced 75% of their weight support during the down-stroke and 25% during the up-stroke: many earlier studies had assumed (implicitly or explicitly) that [[lift (force)|lift]] was generated equally during the two phases of the wingbeat cycle, as is the case of insects of a similar size. This finding shows that hummingbirds' hovering is similar to, but distinct from, that of hovering insects such as the [[hawk moth]]s. (Warrick ''et al.'', 2005).

==Metabolism==
With the exception of insects, hummingbirds while in flight have the highest [[metabolism]] of all animals, a necessity in order to support the rapid beating of their wings. Their [[heart]]beat can reach as high as 1260 beats per minute, a rate once measured in a [[Blue-throated Hummingbird]] [http://www.hummingbirds.net/about.html#heartbeat]. They also typically consume more than their own weight in food each day, and to do so they must visit hundreds of flowers daily. At any given moment, they are only hours away from starving. However, they are capable of slowing down their metabolism at night, or any other time food is not readily available. They enter a [[hibernation]]-like state known as [[torpor]]. During torpor, the heart rate and rate of breathing are both slowed dramatically (the heart rate to roughly 50-180 beats per minute), reducing their need for food.  

Studies of hummingbirds' metabolism are highly relevant to the question of whether a [[bird migration|migrating]] [[Ruby-throated Hummingbird]] can cross 800 [[kilometre|km]] (500 [[mile]]s) of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on a nonstop flight, as field observations suggest it does. This hummingbird, like other birds preparing to migrate, stores up fat to serve as fuel, thereby augmenting its weight by as much as 40 to 50 percent and hence increasing the bird's potential flying time. (Skutch, 1973)

== Range ==

Hummingbirds are found only in the [[Americas]], from southern [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]] to [[Tierra del Fuego]], including the [[West Indies]]. The majority of species occur in tropical [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], but several species also breed in temperate areas.  Excluding vagrants, sometimes from [[Cuba]] or the [[Bahamas]], only the migratory Ruby-throated Hummingbird breeds in eastern [[North America]]. The [[Black-chinned Hummingbird]], its close relative and another migrant, is the most widespread and common species in the western [[United States]] and Canada.

Most hummingbirds of the U.S. and Canada and southern migrate to warmer climates in the northern winter, though some remain in the warmest coastal regions. Some southern South American forms also move to the tropics. 

The Rufous Hummingbird shows an increasing trend to migrate east to winter in the eastern United States, rather than south to Central America, as a result of increasing survival prospects provided by artificial feeders in gardens. In the past, individuals that migrated east would usually die, but now many survive, and their changed migration direction is inherited by their offspring. Provided sufficient food and shelter is available, they are surprisingly hardy, able to tolerate temperatures down to at least -20<U+00B0>C (-4<U+00B0>F).

==Systematics and evolution==
[[image:Hummingbird.jpg|250px|right|thumb|250px|A male [[Costa's Hummingbird]], showing its plumage to good effect]]
Traditionally, hummingbirds are placed in the order [[Apodiformes]], which also contains the [[swift]]s. In the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]], hummingbirds are separated as a new order, '''Trochiliformes''', but this is not well supported by additional evidence. Hummingbirds' wings are hollow and fragile, making fossilization difficult and leaving their evolutionary history a mystery. Some scientists also believe that the hummingbird evolved relatively recently. Scientists also theorize that hummingbirds originated in South America, where there is the greatest species diversity. Brazil and Ecuador contain over half of the known species. 

There are between 325 and 340 species of hummingbird, depending on taxonomic viewpoint, historically divided into two subfamilies, the '''[[hermit (hummingbird)|hermits]]''' (subfamily '''[[Phaethornithinae]]''', 34 species in six genera), and the '''typical hummingbirds''' (subfamily '''[[Trochilinae]]''', all the others).

The modern diversity of hummingbirds is thought by evolutionary biologists to have evolved in South America, as the great majority of the species are found there. However, the ancestor of extant hummingbirds may have lived in parts of Europe to what is southern [[Russia]] today.

Genetic analysis has indicated that the hummingbird lineage diverged from their closest relatives some 35 million years ago, in the Late [[Eocene]], but fossil evidence is limited. Fossil hummingbirds 
are known from the [[Pleistocene]] of [[Brazil]] and the [[Bahamas]] - though neither has yet been scientifically described - and there are fossils and subfossils of a few extant species known, but until recently, older fossils had not been securely identifiable as hummingbirds. 

In [[2004]], Dr. [[Gerald Mayr]] of the [[Senckenberg Museum]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]] identified two 30-million-year-old hummingbird fossils and published his results in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2004/05/06/bird_fossils040506.html</ref> The fossils of this primitive hummingbird species, named ''[[Eurotrochilus inexpectatus]]'' ("unexpected European hummingbird"), had been sitting in a museum drawer in [[Stuttgart]]; they had been unearthed in a clay pit at [[Wiesloch]]-Frauenweiler, south of [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]] and, because it was assumed that hummingbirds never occurred outside the Americas, were not recognized to be hummingbirds until Mayr took a closer look at them.

Fossils of birds not clearly assignable to either hummingbirds or a related, extinct family, the [[Jungornithidae]], have been found at the [[Messel pit]] and in the [[Caucasus]], dating from 40-35 [[mya (unit)|mya]], indicating that the split between these two lineages indeed occurred at that date. The areas where these early fossils have been found had a climate quite similar to the northern [[Caribbean]] or southernmost [[China]] during that time. The biggest remaining mystery at the present time is what happened to hummingbirds in the roughly 25 million years between the primitive ''Eurotrochilus'' and the modern fossils. The astounding morphological adaptations, the decrease in size, and the dispersal to the Americas and extinction in Eurasia all occurred during this timespan. [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] results (Bleiweiss ''et al'', 1994) suggest that the main radiation of South American hummingbirds at least partly took place in the [[Miocene]], some 12-13 mya, during the uplifting of the northern [[Andes]].

==Hummingbirds and humans==

Hummingbirds sometimes fly into [[Garage (house)|garages]] and become trapped. It is widely believed that this is because they mistake the hanging (usually red-color) door-release handle for a flower, although hummingbirds can also get trapped in enclosures that do not contain anything red. Once inside, they may be unable to escape because their natural [[instinct]] when threatened or trapped is to fly upward. This is a life-threatening situation for hummingbirds, as they can become exhausted and die in a relatively short period of time, possibly as little as an hour. If a trapped hummingbird is within reach, it can often be caught gently and released outdoors. It will lie quietly in the space between cupped hands until released.

=== Feeders and nectar ===
The diet of hummingbirds requires an energy source (typically [[nectar]]) and a protein source (typically small insects). For nectar, hummingbirds will happily take artificial nectar from [[bird feeder|man-made feeders]]. Such feeders allow people to observe and enjoy hummingbirds up-close while providing the hummingbirds with a reliable supply of nectar, especially when flower blossoms are less abundant. Homemade nectar can be made from 1 part white, granulated table sugar to 4 parts water, boiled to make it easier to dissolve the sugar and to purify the solution so that it will stay fresh longer. The cooled nectar is then poured into the feeder. Honey should not be used because it is prone to culture bacteria dangerous to hummingbirds.<ref>http://faq.gardenweb.com/faq/lists/hummingbird/2003021845028716.html</ref> Diet sweeteners should also be avoided because, though the hummingbirds will drink it, they will be starved of the calories they need to sustain their metabolism.

Some commercial hummingbird foods contain red dyes and preservatives which are unnecessary and have not been studied for long-term effects on hummingbirds. While it is true that bright colors (especially red) attract hummingbirds, it is better to use a feeder that has some red on it, rather than coloring the water. It is possible that red dye is harmful to hummingbirds.<ref>http://www.hummingbirds.net/dye.html</ref>  Commercial nectar mixes may contain small amounts of mineral nutrients which ''are'' useful to hummingbirds, but hummingbirds get all the nutrients they need from the insects they eat, not from nectar, so the added nutrients are also unnecessary. Authorities on hummingbirds recommend just plain sugar and water (Shackelford ''et al.'', 2005).

A hummingbird feeder should be easy to refill and clean. Prepared nectar can be refrigerated for 1 to 2 weeks before being used, but once placed outdoors it will only remain fresh for 2-4 days in hot weather or 4-6 days in moderate weather before turning cloudy or developing mold. When changing the nectar, the feeder should be rinsed thoroughly with warm tap water, flushing the reservoir and ports to remove any contamination or sugar build-up. If dish soap is used, it needs extra rinsing so that no residue is left behind. The feeder can be soaked in dilute chlorine bleach if black specks of mold appear.

Other animals are also attracted to hummingbird feeders. It is a good idea to get a feeder that has very narrow ports, or ports with mesh-like "wasp guards", to prevent bees and wasps from getting inside where they get trapped. [[New World oriole|Orioles]], woodpeckers, banaquits, and other animals are known to drink from hummingbird feeders, sometimes tipping them and draining the liquid. If this becomes a problem, it is possible to buy feeders which are specifically designed to support their extra weight and which hummingbirds will use too. If ants find your hummingbird feeder, one solution is to install an "ant moat", which is available at specialty garden stores and online, or tanglefoot can be used provided it is applied in location inaccessible to the hummingbirds.
