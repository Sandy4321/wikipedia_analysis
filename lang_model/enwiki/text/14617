'''Norman Alexander "Mervyn" "Red" Dutton''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Canada|CM]]}} (July 23, 1898 <U+2013> March 15, 1987) was a Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] player, coach and executive. He played for the [[Calgary Tigers]] of the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL) and the [[Montreal Maroons]] and [[New York Americans]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  A rugged and physical [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]], Dutton often led his team in [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty minutes]] and was twice named a WCHL All-Star.

Dutton coached and managed the Americans and later purchased the team before suspending operations in 1942 due to World War II.  He served as the second [[NHL Commissioner|president]] of the NHL between 1943 and 1946 before resigning the position after the NHL's owners reneged on a promise to allow the Americans to resume operations following the war.  He served as a [[Stanley Cup]] trustee for 37 years but otherwise limited his involvement with the NHL following the Americans' demise. He was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1958.

A successful businessman, Dutton operated a construction company that built Calgary's [[McMahon Stadium]] in 1960 and he served for a time as the president of the [[Calgary Stampeders]] football club. He was invested as a member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1981 and is honoured by both the [[Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame|Manitoba Hockey]] and Alberta Sports Halls of Fame.  He was posthumously awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] in 1993 in recognition of his contributions to the game of hockey in the United States.

==Early life==
Dutton was born in [[Russell, Manitoba]] on July 23, 1898.<ref name="BlazeMag">{{cite journal |last=Shea |first=Kevin |title=Mervyn "Red" Dutton: Calgary's early hockey hero |journal=Blaze Magazine |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |date=2004 (Playoffs round 4) |page=23}}</ref> His father, Bill, was a successful contractor who helped build Canada's trans-continental railway system,<ref name="MGBillDutton">{{cite news |last=De Geer |first=Vern |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XYMtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cZkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7287,2214942 |title=Good Morning |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1953-12-12 |accessdate=2010-11-27 |page=12}}</ref> and the younger Dutton often helped his father at his work when he was a boy.<ref name="OCStampede">{{cite news |last=O'Brien |first=Andy |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_9IxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b-QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3710%2C2504944 |title=Calgary's incomparable Stampede gets a boss man to match |work=Ottawa Citizen |pages=2<U+2013>3, 28}}</ref>

His given name was Norman Alexander Dutton, but his birth names were quickly ignored.  A family friend of the Duttons refused to call him Norman as the name had a negative connotation for her, so she started to call him "Mervyn", a name that stuck.<ref name="CHStampede1960">{{cite news |title=Stampede honor highlights career |work=Calgary Herald |date=1960-07-11 |pages=19, 25}}</ref> His friends called him "Red" after the colour of his hair, and to most, he was known as Mervyn "Red" Dutton.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers">{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A<U+2013>Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |id=ISBN 0-385-25999-9 |pages=223<U+2013>224}}</ref>  

Dutton attended school at [[St. John's College, University of Manitoba|St. John's College]] in [[Winnipeg]].<ref name="LOHBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195805&type=Player&page=bio&list=ByName#photo |title=Red Dutton biography |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref> He left school in 1915 to volunteer with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] in [[World War I]] and served with the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].<ref name="MGBillDutton" /> He was only 16 at the time, and spent over four years fighting in the war.<ref name="RLPColeman">{{cite news |last=Coleman |first=Jim |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FpNVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GEANAAAAIBAJ&pg=3412,1543299 (story top right corner of page) |title=Jim Coleman's column for July 23 |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1982-07-23 |accessdate=2010-11-27 |page=A12}}</ref>  Dutton fought in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917 where he suffered a [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] wound to his leg serious enough that doctors pressed for amputation.<ref name="BlazeMag" />  Dutton refused and spent the following 18-months working to recover full use of his leg.  He played hockey almost constantly to regain strength in his leg, at one point playing in seven different Winnipeg leagues at the same time.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />

Following the war, Dutton sought to build his own contracting business.  However, an [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] in 1920 forced the closure of his business.  He then worked in a packing plant in Winnipeg that also ceased operations.  Dutton found himself penniless with only his pride preventing him from asking his father for help when he was met by the owner of a hockey team in [[Calgary]] who had sought him out. Dutton was offered $2,500 to play in the Alberta city.<ref name="OCStampede" />

==Playing career==
Dutton joined the Calgary Canadians of Alberta's [[Big-4 League]] for the 1920<U+2013>21 season,<ref name="LOHBio" /> then moved onto the [[Calgary Tigers]] of the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL) in [[1921<U+2013>22 WCHL season|1921<U+2013>22]] where he scored 16 goals and 21 points in 22 games.<ref name="LOHStats">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195805&page=statsawards&list=ByName#photo |title=Red Dutton statistics |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref>  Two seasons later, in [[1923<U+2013>24 WCHL season|1923<U+2013>24]], Dutton and the Tigers won the WCHL championship.  He assisted on the championship winning goal in a 2<U+2013>0 victory over the [[Regina Capitals]] by carrying the puck the length of the ice before passing to [[Cully Wilson]] who scored the goal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tigers are western Canada hockey champions |work=Calgary Herald |date=1924-03-08 |page=20}}</ref> The team then defeated the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]'s [[Vancouver Maroons]] before losing to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in the [[1924 Stanley Cup Final]].<ref name="BlazeMag" />

Twice a WCHL all-star,<ref name="LOHBio" /> Dutton played five seasons for the Tigers.  Known for his aggressive, physical style, he led the team in [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty minutes]] in each of those five years.<ref name="BlazeMag" />  Financial pressures forced the Western League to sell its interests to the NHL following the [[1925<U+2013>26 WHL season|1925<U+2013>26 season]],<ref>{{cite news |title=West unable to withstand financial pressure in effort to retain hockey |work=Calgary Herald |date=1926-05-06 |page=17}}</ref> and having suffered a serious knee injury during the season, Dutton was left unsure of his future.<ref name="OCStampede" /> 

None the less, his rights were sold to the [[Montreal Maroons]],<ref name="LOHStats" /> and he made his NHL debut on November 20, 1926 against the Canadiens.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SI4uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=94sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6521,2831157 |title=Bumper crowd as Canadiens battle Maroons tonight |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1926-11-20 |accessdate=2010-11-26 |page=22}}</ref> Dutton played four seasons with the Maroons, scoring 15 goals and 41 points.<ref name="LOHStats" /> He played in the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals for the second time in his career in [[1927<U+2013>28 NHL season|1927<U+2013>28]], but the Maroons lost the best-of-five [[1928 Stanley Cup Finals|final]] three games to two.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pm8tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9YsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6497,2055650 |title=N.Y.

Dutton was the subject of trade talks between the Maroons and the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] following the [[1928<U+2013>29 NHL season]].  The teams had been negotiating to send [[Marvin Wentworth|Cyclone Wentworth]] to Montreal in exchange for Dutton and [[Babe Siebert]] before the Black Hawks purchased the contract of [[Taffy Abel]], which ended the trade negotiations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZcNcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=71gNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5207,6093406 |title=Black Hawks land Abel from Rangers |work=Providence Evening Tribune |date=1929-04-17 |accessdate=2010-11-26 |page=11}}</ref> The Maroons continued to make Dutton available, with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] showing interest following the [[1929<U+2013>30 NHL season|1929<U+2013>30 season]].<ref>{{cite news |url=Pittsburgh Pirates are sold to Cleveland hockey concern |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1930-05-12 |accessdate=2010-11-26 |page=10}}</ref> Finally, he was sold to the [[New York Americans]] along with [[Mike Neville]], [[Hap Emms]] and [[Frank Carson]] for $35,000.<ref name="LOHStats" />

At first distraught at leaving Montreal, Dutton quickly adapted to playing in New York.<ref name="RLPColeman" /> He maintained his aggressive style of play with the Americans, again leading the league in penalties in [[1931<U+2013>32 NHL season|1931<U+2013>32]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/top_league.php?lid=nhl1927&sid=1932&leaguenm=NHL |title=1931<U+2013>32 NHL statistics |accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref> Despite his fiery temper, Dutton became one of the most popular players in New York amongst both the fans and his fellow players.<ref name="NYT1961">{{cite news |last=Daley |first=Arthur |title=The flamboyant redhead |work=New York Times |date=1961-05-21}}</ref> He was not able to turn the Americans' fortunes on the ice around, however, as the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in his first five seasons with the team.<ref name="LOHStats" />

Dutton was named the coach of the Americans for the [[1935<U+2013>36 NHL season]], and in doing so became the second player-coach in NHL history.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tMgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6WoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5190,2232427 |title=Red Dutton is new manager of Americans |work=Lewiston Daily Sun |date=1935-04-24 |accessdate=2010-11-28 |page=18}}</ref> Under his leadership, the Americans finished third in the [[Canadian Division]] with a 16<U+2013>25<U+2013>7 record and qualified for the post season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19351936&type=DIV |title=1935<U+2013>36 regular season standings |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref> The Americans then went on to defeat the Black Hawks 7<U+2013>5 in a two-game, total-goal series to face the Maple Leafs in the league semi-final series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lH8tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I5kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2694,3522672 |title=Red Dutton surprised |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1936-03-28 |accessdate=2010-11-28 |page=16}}</ref> Dutton was unable to play parts of the series against Toronto due to a hip injury,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ng8_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=jk4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=2422%2C490404 |title=Another spurt wins for Leafs |work=Windsor Daily Star |date=1936-03-28 |accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref> and the Americans lost the best-of-three series two games to one.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McFarlane |first=Brian |year=1990|title=100 Years of Hockey|isbn=0929091264|publisher=Summerhill Press|id=ISBN 0-929091-26-4 |page=34}}</ref>  Dutton retired as a player following the season and turned his focus to coaching full-time.<ref name="OCStampede" />

==Executive career==
While Dutton focused on coaching the team, the Americans were facing bankruptcy.<ref name="RLPColeman" /> Team owner [[William Dwyer|Bill Dwyer]], heavily in debt, turned to Dutton who lent $20,000 to allow the team to continue operating.  When the NHL finally forced Dwyer out and took over ownership of the franchise, the league asked Dutton to take over management of the team.<ref name="NYT1961" />

Though the ownerless team was written off by press and labeled as being "orphans",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7SE_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=wU8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=6151,3990505 |title=Red Dutton has faith in his motley crew |work=Windsor Daily Star |date=1938-01-19 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}</ref> Dutton built an Americans team in [[1937<U+2013>38 NHL season|1937<U+2013>38]] that finished with a 19<U+2013>18<U+2013>11 record. it was only the third time in the team's 13 year history they finished with a winning record.

Following the sudden death of [[Frank Calder]] in 1943, the NHL asked Dutton to serve as acting-president of the league.<ref name="HeraldColeman1980">{{cite news |last=Coleman |first=Jim |title=Dutton link with bygone era |work=Calgary Herald |date=1980-10-10 |page=D2}}</ref> The owners wanted Dutton in the post both because he was popular with the players, and because they felt they could control him.

In spite of his earlier reluctance to retain the presidency, Dutton completed a five-year agreement to remain as the head of the NHL in 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carroll |first=Dink |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UX4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ApkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2327%2C2546045 |title=Red reappointed for five-year term |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1945-06-15 |accessdate=2010-12-03 |page=14}}</ref> Dutton continued to make inquiries on the status of his team, but found in 1946 that the owners had reneged on their promise.

Dutton felt that the Rangers were responsible for the league's refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, Dutton swore that the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup in his lifetime.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bonanno |first=Rocky |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=503836 |title=Rangers' Cup "curse" lasted 54 years |publisher=National Hockey League |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}</ref> His vow became known as "[[Curse of 1940|Dutton's Curse]]".

==Business career==
Dutton used the money he earned with the Tigers and Maroons to start a second contracting business.  It too failed in 1933 as a result of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="OCStampede" /> In 1938, he tried again, joining with Reg Jennings and his brother Jack to form the Standard Gravel and Surfacing Company in Calgary.<ref name="RLPColeman" />  The company proved immensely successful during [[World War II]], building numerous airports within Canada as part of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] as well as completing highways in northern Alberta and the [[Northwest Territories]].<ref name="OCStampede" />  By 1960, their company had become Standard Holdings Ltd., and operated 20 different companies and had $70 million in contracts for that year alone,<ref name="CHStampede1960" /> and Dutton had personally become a millionaire.<ref name="NYT1961" />

He remained active in the sporting world as well.  When the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] found themselves in financial trouble in 1955,<ref>{{cite news |title=Grid operation mode outlined |work=Calgary Herald |date=1955-12-14 |page=48}}</ref> Dutton led a group of Calgary businessmen in purchasing the team.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Gorde |title=Red Dutton heads new group to take over local grid entry |work=Calgary Herald |date=1955-12-20 |page=26}}</ref> He was named president of the team, a post he held until 1959.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sport front briefs |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=1959-02-10 |page=Sports 14}}</ref>  In 1960, his company was contracted to build [[McMahon Stadium]] as the new home of the Stampeders.  He bet the stadium's benefactor, [[George McMahon]], $1,000 that he could complete the 19,000 seat facility within four months.  He won the bet with three days to spare.<ref>{{cite news |last=Maki |first=Allan |title=No task was too big for Red Dutton to tackle |work=Calgary Herald |date=1987-03-16 |page=A1}}</ref>

Also in 1960, Dutton was named president of the [[Calgary Stampede|Calgary Exhibition and Stampede]] on a two-year term.<ref name="CHStampede1960" /> He had been a Stampede director for ten-years previous to his appointment.<ref name="OCStampede" /> As head of the exhibition, he also spoke for the [[Calgary Stampeders (ice hockey)|Stampeders]] hockey team of the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ob1UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8jsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3942,3194301 |title=Franchise talk to come later |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1961-04-15 |accessdate=2010-12-04 |page=25}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Dutton and his wife Phyllis had four children.

Following the betrayal of the NHL owner's promise to revive the Americans, Dutton vowed never to return to an NHL arena again.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" /> In spite of this, he accepted a nomination in 1950 to become one of two Stanley Cup trustees, a position he held until his death in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_stTrustees.htm |title=Stanley Cup trustees |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>  In 1958, he was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].<ref name="LOHBio" />  Even with these accolades, Dutton remained apart from the NHL until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he dropped the puck for the ceremonial [[face-off|faceoff]] prior to the first game in [[Calgary Flames]]' history.<ref name="HeraldColeman1980" />

In recognition of his life and career, Dutton was invested as a member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&TypeID=orc&id=481 |title=Order of Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> In 1993, the NHL posthumously named him one of four recipients of the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] in recognition of his contributions to hockey in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashlesterpatrick.htm |title=Lester Patrick Trophy |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>  He was inducted into the [[Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1998,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.mb.ca/honoured/1998/mDutton.htm |title=Mervyn "Red" Dutton |publisher=Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.albertasportshalloffame.com/default.aspx?p=member&mid=979 |title=Dutton, Mervyn aka.
