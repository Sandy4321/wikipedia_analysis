==Description==
[[File:Sidney_Hall_-_Urania's_Mirror_-_Perseus.jpg|thumb|The sub-constellation "Caput Medus<U+00E6>" can be seen in the card for [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].]]
''Urania's Mirror'' illustrates 79<!--Count the ones listed in Ridpath: Caput Medus<U+00E6> is a subconsteallation, and "Vulpecula and Anser" a single constellation sometimes divided into two, but, if you look at the art, it is not divided up.--> constellations, some of which are now [[obsolete constellation|obsolete]], and various subconstellations, such as Caput Medus<U+00E6>, the head of Medusa, carried by Perseus.<ref name=Ridpath /> It was originally advertised as including "all the constellations visible in the British Empire",<ref name=Advertisement /><ref name=Hingley238 /> but, in fact, leaves out the [[southern constellations]] (which can be seen from Australia<!-- source lists places in Australia-->) and, by the second edition, the advertisements were changed to merely claim illustration of the constellations visible from  "Great Britain".<ref name=Hingley238 /> 

P.D. Hingley calls it "One of the most charming and visually attractive of the many aids to astronomical self-instruction produced in the early nineteenth century". On its main gimmick - the holes in the stars meant to show the constellation when held in front of a light, he notes that, as the size of the holes marked correspond to the magnitude of the stars, a quite realistic depiction of the constellation is provided.<ref name=Hingley238 /> [[Ian Ridpath]] mostly concurs. He describes the gimmick as an "attractive feature", but notes that, due to the light at the time being provided primarily by candles, that many cards likely burned up due to carelessness when trying to hold them in front of the flame. He notes three other attempts to use the same gimmick -  Franz Niklaus K<U+00F6>nig<U+2019>s ''Atlas c<U+00E9>leste'' (1826), Friedrich Braun's ''Himmels-Atlas in transparenten Karten'' (1850),  and Otto M<U+00F6>llinger<U+2019>s ''Himmelsatlas'' (1851), but states that they lack ''Urania's Mirror''<!-- -->'s artistry.<ref name=Ridpath />

The depictions of the constellations are copied from those in Alexander Jamieson's ''[[A Celestial Atlas]]'', published about three years earlier, and includes unique quirks of Jamieson's sky atlas, including the new constellation of [[Noctua (constellation)|Noctua]] the owl, and "Norma Nilotica" - a measuring device for the Nile floods - held by [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] the water bearer.<ref name=Ridpath />

==Mystery of the designer, and solution==
[[File:Advertisement_for_Urania's_Mirror.png|300px|thumb|Advertisement for ''Urania's Mirror'' from December 1824.]]
Advertisements for ''Urania's Mirror'', as well as the introduction to its companion book ''A Familiar Treatise on Astonomy'' credits the design of the cards to "a lady", stated to be "young" in the introduction of the book. This led to speculation for over a century, with prominent female astronomers such as [[Caroline Herschel]] and [[Mary Somerville]] being proposed, with others simply crediting the engraver, [[Sidney Hall]], alone, but none of these were seen as a particularly good fit.<ref name=Hingley238 /> The solution was not discovered until 170 years later, in 1994, when, while archiving early election certificates used to propose people to be admitted to the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], P. D. Hingley found one proposing the Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam, and naming him as "Author of Urania's Mirror".<ref name=Hingley239 />  While he had several notable sons,<ref name=Hingley239 /> he has no other known publications, his main distinction having have served as assistant master at [[Rugby School]] for 38 years.<ref name=Hingley239 />

The reasons for the disguise is unknown. Hingley notes that many publications of the time attempted to suggest women had a role in their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening to both genders. He notes that anonymity might have been necessary to protect his position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this seem unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility.<ref name=Hingley240>{{cite journal|last=Hingley|first=P. D. |date=1994|title=''Urania's Mirror'' <U+2014> A 170-year old mystery solved?|journal= Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=104|issue=5|pages=238-40|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994JBAA..104..238H}} p. [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/gif/1994JBAA..104..238H/0000240.000.html 240]</ref> Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from ''[[A Celestial Atlas]]'', suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.<ref name=Ridpath />

==Editions==
<gallery mode=packed heights=250px>
File:Aspin-1825-Pisces.jpg|First edition "[[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]", without stars in the surrounding constellations. "Plain".
File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Pisces.jpg|Second edition "Pisces", with the surrounding stars. "Fully coloured".
</gallery>

A December 1824 advertisement, which states the cards were "just published" offers to sell the the cards "plain" for <U+00A3>1/8s or "fully coloured" for <U+00A3>1/14s.<ref name=Advertisement /> This first edition did not include any stars surrounding the named constellations, leaving parts of the card blank. This was soon changed in a second edition, which added the stars around the depicted constellations back in.<ref name=Ridpath /> The accompanying book, ''A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy'' by Jehoshaphat Aspin went through at least four editions, with the last of these coming out in 1834.<ref name=Ridpath /> The second edition featured a marked expansion in the book's contents, growing from 121 pages in the first edition to 200 pages in the second.<ref name=Hingley238 /> An American edition was published in 1832. In the modern day, reprints of the cards were produced in 1993, and [[Barnes and Noble]] reproduced the American edition (with accompanying book) in 2004.<ref name=Ridpath />
