'''Alton Coleman''' was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. He was [[execution|executed]] by the state of [[Ohio]] on April 26, 2002 for the murder of 44-year-old Marlene Walters of [[Norwood, Ohio]] during a six-state killing spree in 1984.

===Overview===
Coleman received four [[capital punishment|death sentences]] from three Midwest states: [[Illinois]], Ohio (two times), and in [[Indiana]]. At the time of his execution he was the only condemned person in the country to have death sentences in three states. His partner-in-crime, '''Debra Denise Brown''', was originally slated to be executed in Ohio, but in 1991 her death sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life in prison]] by Gov. [[Richard Celeste]]. She still has a [[death sentence]] for the murder the duo committed in Indiana. However, Brown is serving her sentence, without possibility of [[parole]], in the Ohio Reformatory for Women in [[Marysville, Ohio]]. 

During the summer of [[1984]] the 28-year-old Coleman and Brown, who was 21 at the time, embarked upon a killing spree through several Midwestern states.

By the time the couple were caught, Coleman was charged or wanted for questioning in [[assault]]s on at least 20 people in 13 separate attacks, including seven murders. Almost all of the victims were [[African-American]] like Coleman and Brown, but authorities said that was simply because the duo knew they would blend better in the black community, and that there was no [[racism|racial motive]] in the murders.

===Background of Coleman and Brown===
[[Image:Alton coleman.png|thumb|left|Alton Coleman]]Coleman was a middle-school drop-out who lived with his 73-year-old grandmother in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and who was well-known to the Illinois law enforcement community. The son of a prostitute who would often have sex with customers in his presence, he was charged with [[sex crime]]s six times between [[1973]] and [[1983]]. Two of the cases were dismissed, and Coleman pleaded guilty to lesser charges in two and was twice acquitted. Coleman was scheduled to go on trial in Illinois on charges stemming from the [[rape]] of a 14-year-old girl when he fled and began his indiscriminate killing.

[[Image:Debra brown.png|thumb|right|Debra Brown]]One of 11 children, Brown was borderline [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]], suffered head [[Physical trauma|trauma]] as a child, and was described as a "dependent personality." She was engaged to another man when she met Coleman in 1983, but left her family and moved in with him shortly afterward. Although a willing participant in the assaults and murders, Brown was never violent or in trouble with the law until she met up with Coleman.

In commuting Brown's sentence, Gov. Celeste cited her low IQ scores, ranging from 59 to 74, and her "master-slave" relationship with Coleman. Brown was one of eight Ohio [[death row]] inmates to have her sentence commuted by Celeste, a staunch opponent of capital punishment, a week before he left office. Four of those whose sentences were commuted were the state's only female death row inmates.

Despite her non-violent history before the spree, Brown remains unrepentant for her acts. During the sentencing phase of her first Ohio trial, Brown sent a note to the judge which read in part: "I killed the bitch and I don't give a damn. I had fun out of it."

===Details of the Murders===
====May 1984====
Their crimes began in [[May]] [[1984]] when Coleman befriended Juanita Wheat who lived in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], and was the mother of nine-year-old Vernita. On [[May 29]], [[1984]], Coleman abducted Vernita to [[Waukegan, Illinois]]. Her body was discovered on [[June 19]], 1984 in an abandoned building, four blocks from Coleman's grandmother's apartment. The body was badly decomposed and the cause of death was ligature strangulation.

On [[May 31]], 1984, Coleman befriended Robert Carpenter in Waukegan, Illinois, and spent the night at his home. The next day he borrowed Carpenter's car to go to the store and never returned.

====June 1984====
In [[June 1984]], Coleman and Brown appeared in [[Gary, Indiana]], where they encountered two young girls, 9-year-old Annie  <!-- Out of respect for her privacy, the author (User:Marklemagne) is unilaterally withholding Annie's surname. It is available to interested parties in the various court records. --> and 7 year old Tamika Turks. Tamika's partially decomposed body was discovered on [[June 19]], 1984. The cause of death was ligature strangulation. Annie survived, despite being sexually assaulted by both Coleman and Brown. 

The day Tamika's body was found, Coleman befriended Donna Williams, 25, of Gary. On [[July 11]], 1984, Williams' badly decomposed body was discovered in [[Detroit]], about a half-mile from where her car was found. The cause of death was again ligature strangulation.

On [[June 28]], 1984, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer Jones of [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan]]. Palmer was handcuffed by Coleman and then badly beaten. Mrs. Jones was also attacked. Coleman ripped the Jones' phone from the wall and stole their money and car.

====July 1984====
The day after [[Independence Day]] 1984, Coleman and Brown came to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where Coleman befriended Virginia Temple, the mother of several children. Her eldest child was Rachelle, aged nine. When Virginia dropped out of communication with relatives, they became concerned about the children and entering the home found the young children alone and frightened. Virginia's and Rachelle's bodies were discovered in a crawl space. A bracelet was missing from the home and later was found in [[Cincinnati]] under the body of Tonnie Storey. The cause of death of both Virginia and Rachelle was strangulation.

Two days after the murders of Virginia and Rachelle, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Frank and Dorothy Duvendack of Toledo where Coleman proceeded to bind the couple with appliance and phone cords which had been cut. Coleman and Brown took money and the Duvendack's car. 

Later that same day, Coleman and Brown appeared at the home of the Reverend and Mrs. Millard Gay of [[Dayton, Ohio]]. They stayed with them in Dayton and then accompanied them to [[Lockwood, Ohio]], on [[July 9]], to a religious service. On [[July 10]], the Gays dropped off Coleman and Brown in downtown Cincinnati.

By this time, Coleman had come to the attention of the [[FBI]], which on [[July 12]], 1984, added him to its [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted List]] as a "special addition." Coleman was just the 10th person since the initiation of the list in [[1950]] to merit inclusion in such a manner.

Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood, Ohio, on [[July 13]] at about 9:30 a.m. Less than three hours later they drove away in Harry Walters' car, leaving Harry Walters unconscious and his wife, Marlene, dead.

Harry Walters survived. He testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had put up for sale. Walters sat on the couch as he and Coleman discussed the trailer title. Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Harry Walters on the back of the head. The force of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain. From that point on, Mr. Walters remembered little else.

Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, came home from work at about 3:45 p.m. At the bottom of the basement steps, she found her father, barely alive, and her mother, dead. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet. Her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back. Her mother's head was covered with a bloody sheet.

The [[coroner]] indicated Marlene Walters had been struck on the head approximately 20 to 25 times. Twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of vice grips, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was smashed to pieces. Parts of her skull and brain were missing.

The living room hallway, and basement, were splattered with blood. Fragments of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a blood-stained magazine rack located in the living room. Bloody footprints, made by two different kinds of shoes, were found in the basement.

The family car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was gone. Money, jewelry, and shoes had been stolen. Left behind were two bicycles, clothes and shoes.

Two days later, the Plymouth showed up abandoned in [[Kentucky]]. The couple then kidnapped Oline Carmichael Jr., a [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]], college professor and drove back to Dayton with their victim locked in the trunk of the car. On [[July 17]], in Dayton, they abandoned this stolen vehicle and Carmichael was rescued by authorities. 

Coleman and Brown reappeared at the home of Millard and Kathryn Gay. The Rev. Gay recognized Coleman, who was by this time the subject of a huge nationwide manhunt, and he and his wife were accosted with guns. The Rev. Gay asked Coleman, "Why you want to do us like that, like this," and according to Gay, Coleman responded: "I'm not going to kill you, but we generally kills them where we go." Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward Evanston.

On the way back home, they take time to steal another car, killing the 77-year-old man who owned it.

===Capture and Trial===
On [[July 17]], [[1984]], Alton Coleman became the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|388th fugitive listed by the FBI]] on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]].<ref name="50th">{{cite book|author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |title=FBI<U+2019>s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Program: 50th Anniversary 1950-2000 |publisher=K&D Limited, Inc. |year=2000}}</ref>

The pair was finally captured on [[July 20]], 1984 as they watched a pick-up basketball game in an Evanston park. Coleman had been recognized by a childhood friend who alerted police. In sharp contrast to their violent rampage, both Coleman and Brown surrendered peacefully.

A week after the pair was arrested, more than 50 law enforcement officials from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio met to plan their strategy for prosecuting Coleman and Brown. Michigan, which does not have the death penalty, was quickly ruled out as the place to begin and eventually Ohio was given the first shot at the alleged spree killers.
	
"We are convinced that prosecution (in Ohio) can most quickly and most likely result in the swiftest imposition of the death penalty against Alton Coleman and Debra Brown," U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb said.

===Appeals and Execution===
Ohio was successful in convicting Coleman and Brown on a pair of aggravated murder charges (In May 1985 for the murder of Tonnie Storey, and in June 1985 for the murder of Marlene Walters), as well as a plethora of other violent crimes. They were both sentenced to be executed and the lengthy appeals process began. Coleman's case went to the [[United States Supreme Court]] several times between [[1985]] and [[2002]], but his numerous arguments that his conviction and death sentence were unconstitutional failed to sway the justices.

By April 2002, time had run out for Coleman. His last-ditch effort to avoid lethal injection was unsuccessful when on April 25, 2002, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a claim by Coleman's attorneys that the state's plan to accommodate the large number of victims and survivors who wanted to view the execution would turn it into a "spectator sport." There were so many victims and survivors who were allowed to witness the execution that prison officials had been forced to set up a closed-circuit viewing outside the death house. 

For his final meal, Coleman ordered a well-done filet mignon smothered with onions, fried chicken breasts, a salad with French dressing, sweet-potato pie topped with whipped cream, french fries, collard greens, onion rings, cornbread, broccoli with melted cheese and biscuits and gravy. He washed it all down with a Cherry Coke {{Fact|date=February 2007}} . 

On April 26, 2002, reciting "The Lord is my shepherd," Alton Coleman died by lethal injection in the death chamber at the state prison in [[Lucasville]].

Reginald Wilkinson, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, said Coleman did not convey remorse for the killings {{Fact|date=February 2007}} .
