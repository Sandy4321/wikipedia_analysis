'''Elizabeth Warren''' ({{nee}} '''Herring'''; born June 22, 1949) is an [[United States|American]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy law]] expert, [[Harvard Law School]] professor, and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee in the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2012|2012 United States Senate election in Massachusetts]]. Her work as a national policy advocate led to the conception and establishment of the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]. She has written a number of academic and popular works, and is a frequent subject of media interviews regarding the American economy and personal finance.

Born in [[Oklahoma City]], Warren attended [[The George Washington University]] and the [[University of Houston]]. She received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Rutgers School of Law<U+2013>Newark]] in 1976, and went on to teach law at several universities before joining Harvard in the early 1990s. In the wake of the [[2008 financial crisis]], Warren served as chair of the [[Congressional Oversight Panel]] created to oversee the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program|Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)]]. She later served as [[Assistant to the President#Organization|Assistant to the President]] and Special Advisor to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. In the late 2000s she was recognized by publications such as the ''[[National Law Journal]]'' and the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] as an increasingly influential public policy figure. She announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate in September 2011, challenging [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Scott Brown]], and won the Democratic Party nomination in June 2012.

In 1995 Warren was asked to advise the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. She helped to draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict the right of consumers to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005 Congress passed the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Suzanna |last=Andrews |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/11/elizabeth-warren-201111#gotopage3 |title=The Woman Who Knew Too Much |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=November 2011 |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Public life===
Warren has had a high public profile; she has appeared in the [[documentary film]]s ''[[Maxed Out]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]''.<ref name="Rose">{{cite news |title=Elizabeth Warren on Charlie Rose|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10292|date=May 11, 2009}}{{cite news |title=Elizabeth Warren on Charlie Rose|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10895|date=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>  She has appeared numerous times on TV programs including ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Elizabeth Warren on the Daily Show |url=http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2009/04/tarp-cop-on-daily-show.html |date=April 15, 2009}}

===Books and other works===
Warren has written several books, including ''All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan'', coauthored with her daughter, Amelia Tyagi.

Warren and Tyagi wrote ''The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke''.  Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30 years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income-earners, families are no longer able to save and have incurred greater and greater debt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Elizabeth|title=All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan|year=2005|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0743269872|author2=Amelia Warren Tyagi|accessdate=16 September 2012|page=1-12}}</ref> 

In an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jeff Madrick]] said of Warren's book:
{{quote| The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children...&nbsp;their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.<ref>{{cite news |last=Madrick |first=Jeff |title=Necessities, not luxuries, are driving Americans into debt, a new book says |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/business/economic-scene-necessities-not-luxuries-are-driving-americans-into-debt-new-book.html |date=September 4, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 3, 2009 }}</ref> }}

Writing in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, Maryanna Murray Buechner said of Warren's book:
{{quote| For families looking for ways to cope, Warren and Tyagi mainly offer palliatives: Buy a cheaper house. Squirrel away a six-month cash cushion. Yeah, right. But they also know that there are no easy solutions. Readers who are already committed to a house and parenthood will find little to mitigate the deflating sense that they have nowhere to go but down.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buechner |first=Maryanne Murray |title=Parent Trap |date=September 8, 2003 |url=http://www.time.com/time/insidebiz/article/0,9171,1101030915-483310,00.html |work=TIME |accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref> }}

In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Himmelstein |first1=David U. |last2=Warren |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Deborah |last4=Woolhandler |first4=Steffie J. |title=Illness and Injury as Contributors to Bankruptcy |date=2005-02-08 |ssrn=664565 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |doi=10.2139/ssrn.664565 |first3=Deborah |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}</ref> which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem.

==Economic official==
===TARP oversight===
On November 14, 2008, Warren was appointed by [[United States Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] to chair the five-member [[Congressional Oversight Panel]] created to oversee the implementation of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=What Does $700 Billion Buy Taxpayers? |series=Fresh Air from WHYY |serieslink=Fresh Air |credits=Host: [[Terry Gross]]| network=[[National Public Radio]] |airdate=December 11, 2008 |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98123372 |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}</ref>  The Panel released monthly oversight reports that evaluate the government bailout and related programs.<ref name="Kantor">{{cite news |first=Jodi |last=Kantor |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/business/25warren.html |title=Behind Consumer Agency Idea, a Tireless Advocate |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 25, 2010}}</ref> During  Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, [[AIG]], bank stress tests, the impact of the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry, and other topics.<ref group="lower-alpha">All reports and videos are available online at [http://cop.senate.gov/ cop.senate.gov].</ref>

===Consumer Financial Protection Bureau===
[[File:Nomination of Richard Cordray.jpg|thumb|left|Warren stands next to President [[Barack Obama]] as he announces the nomination of [[Richard Cordray]] as the first director of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] during a statement at the [[White House]].]] Warren has long advocated the creation of a new [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]. The bureau was established by the [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. For the first year after the bill's signing, Warren worked on implementation of the bureau as a [[Special Assistant to the President]] in anticipation of the agency's formal opening. While [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] groups and [[consumer advocacy]] groups pushed for Obama to nominate Warren as the agency's permanent director,  Warren was strongly opposed by financial institutions which had criticized Warren as overly aggressive in pursuing regulations, and by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of Congress.<ref name = "Vanity Fair-Andrews-2011-07">

In July 2011, Obama announced the nomination of former [[Attorney General of Ohio|Ohio Attorney General]] [[Richard Cordray]] as the bureau's director.<ref>

However, his nomination was blocked by a Republican-led filibuster in the Senate. Without a director, the agency could not supervise non-bank financial companies or write new regulations. On 4 January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, President Obama appointed Cordray as the Bureau's Director in a "recess appointment".<ref>

And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged." Warren said Wall Street CEOs "wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs" and that they "still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warren-democratic-national-convention-system-rigged/story?id=17150134#.UEleDrLiYRk Elizabeth Warren: 'The System Is Rigged']</ref><ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/national_world&id=8799978 Elizabeth Warren, Bill Clinton speak at Democratic National Convention]</ref><ref>

In April 2012, the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported that in the 1990s, Harvard Law School had, in response to criticisms about the lack of faculty diversity, publicized Warren's law directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed her as having [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry.<ref name="Harvard trips">{{cite web|last=Chabot |first=Hillary |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view.bg?articleid=1061127454 |title=Harvard trips on roots of Elizabeth Warren<U+2019>s family tree |publisher=BostonHerald.com |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref><ref name="Carmichael">{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-05-25/news/31852969_1_harvard-law-school-answer-elizabeth-warren |title=Filings raise more questions on Warren<U+2019>s ethnic claims |publisher=Boston Globe |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ebbert |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2012/04/30/elizabeth_warren_was_listed_as_a_minority_professor_in_law_directories_in_the_80s_and_90s/ |title=Directories identified Warren as minority |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> Warren said she identified as a minority in the law directory listing (of the 1980s and 1990s) in hopes of being invited to events to meet people of similar background.<ref name="cbsnews3May12">{{cite news  | last = Madison | first = Lucy  | title = Warren explains minority listing, talks of grandfather's "high cheekbones" | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57427355-503544/warren-explains-minority-listing-talks-of-grandfathers-high-cheekbones/ | publisher = [[CBS News]] | date = May 3, 2012 | accessdate = 12 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chabot |first=Hillary |url=http://bostonherald.com/news/politics/view/20220502warren_i_used_minority_listing_to_make_friends |title=Warren: I used minority listing to share heritage |publisher=BostonHerald.com |date=2012-05-02 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> Harvard Law professor [[Charles Fried]], who had served as Solicitor General in the Reagan administration<ref> [http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=21 Harvard Law directory]</ref> and sat on the appointing committee that recommended Warren for hire in 1995, said that her heritage was never mentioned and played no role in the appointments process.<ref name="Harvard trips"/>

The Brown campaign called on Warren to "come clean about her motivations for making these claims and explain the contradictions between her rhetoric and the record". Warren's campaign responded that she was proud of her heritage and denied any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=Chris|title=Scott Brown calls on Warren camp to <U+2018>come clean<U+2019>|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1061128161&srvc=rss|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> Warren said she had not received any preferential treatment due to her claimed Native American heritage, and stated, "Every single person who has been involved in hiring me has issued a statement to that effect."<ref>{{cite web|author=John Suchocki |url=http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/06/elizabeth_warren_makes_emotion.html |title=Elizabeth Warren makes emotional defense of Native American background after arriving in Springfield for Massachusetts Democratic convention |work=The Republican |publisher=masslive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

The New England Historical Genealogical Society initially announced in May 2012 that it had found evidence for Warren's claims, but later recanted, saying, "We have no proof that Elizabeth Warren<U+2019>s great-great-great-grandmother O.C.
