===Part 1===
<!-- WP:FILMPLOT STIPULATES PLOT SUMMARIES "SHOULD" BE 400<U+2013>700 WORDS. IMPROVE THE SUMMARY BY ALL MEANS, BUT CHECK THAT YOU STAY WITHIN THESE LIMITS. DO NOT REMOVE THIS NOTICE -->
Minister [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] addresses the wizarding media stating that the [[Ministry of Magic]] will remain strong as Lord Voldemort gains power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. [[Severus Snape]] arrives at Malfoy Manor to inform Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters of Harry's departure from No. 4 Privet Drive. Voldemort commandeers [[Lucius Malfoy]]'s wand, as Voldemort's own wand cannot be used to kill Harry.
Meanwhile, the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] arrive at Privet Drive and escort Harry to safety using [[Polyjuice Potion]] to create six decoy Harrys. During their flight to the Burrow they are ambushed by [[Death Eater]]s, resulting in the deaths of [[Mad-Eye Moody]] and [[Hedwig (Harry Potter)|Hedwig]]. Voldemort attempts to kill Harry with Malfoy's wand, but fails. At the Burrow, Harry has a vision of Ollivander being tormented by Voldemort, who claims that the wand-maker had lied to him by informing him of the only way to kill Harry: obtaining another's wand.

Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow and distributes items from [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s will to Ron, Hermione and Harry. Ron receives Dumbledore's Deluminator; Hermione, [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]; and Harry is given the Golden Snitch. It's revealed that Harry was also willed to receive the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, however Scrimgeour states that the sword is an important historical artifact and is not eligible to be given away.

Later, the wedding of [[Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] is disrupted by Death Eaters, who have infiltrated the Ministry and are using its authority to persecute Muggle-born witches and wizards. The trio [[Disapparation|disapparate]] to London and find sanctuary at [[12 Grimmauld Place|No. 12 Grimmauld Place]]. There they discover that the "R.A.B." from the false Horcrux locket is [[Regulus Arcturus Black]], the younger brother of [[Sirius Black]]. From [[Kreacher]], the Black's house-elf, they learn that [[Mundungus Fletcher]] stole the real locket. Kreacher and [[Dobby the house elf|Dobby]] apprehend Fletcher, who reveals that the locket is in the possession of [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Under the disguise of Polyjuice Potion, the trio infiltrate the Ministry and successfully retrieve the locket, escaping into the wilderness.

Unable to destroy the Horcrux, they take turns wearing it in order to dilute its negative psychological effects. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating [[Gregorovitch]], a renowned wand-maker who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary [[Elder Wand]] from his shop. Voldemort then begins a search for the thief. While Ron wears the locket, he is overcome with the suspicion that Harry and Hermione are forming a romantic relationship. As a result, he abandons them. Harry and Hermione then visit Godric's Hollow where they seek [[Bathilda Bagshot]], the historian who may have the Sword of Gryffindor, which they believe will destroy Horcruxes. However, they are instead cornered by Voldemort's snake, [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]], and barely escape. Harry's wand is broken. Hermione identifies the mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as [[Gellert Grindelwald]].

When evening falls, Harry sees a doe [[ExpectoPatronus|patronus]] which leads him to a frozen pond. Gryffindor's sword is beneath the ice. Harry enters the pool through the ice to reach the sword. The locket around his neck attempts to strangle him, but Ron returns to rescue him. Ron eventually overcomes the locket's power, smashing it with the sword.

The trio then visit [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] to learn about a symbol seen several times on their journey. They learn that the symbol represents the quest for the [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]]: the [[Elder Wand]], the [[Resurrection Stone]] and the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Cloak of Invisibility|Cloak of Invisibility]]. Lovegood betrays them to the Death Eaters in an effort to have his kidnapped daughter returned. Harry envisions Voldemort learning from Grindelwald that the Elder Wand lies with Dumbledore. The trio are captured and taken to [[Malfoy Manor]]. [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] imprisons Harry and Ron in a cellar in which they discover [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], Ollivander, and [[Griphook]] the goblin. She tortures Hermione for information on how they found the sword, which was supposedly in a vault at [[Gringotts]]. After Dobby apparates to save them, a short battle ensues, and Harry duels with Draco and defeats him. Dobby is killed by Bellatrix as the protagonists escape. Voldemort breaks into Dumbledore's tomb and takes the Elder Wand.

==Production==
===Development===
The decision to divide Rowling's final book into a two-part film came from the original declined proposal to split ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'' in 2004. ''Deathly Hallows'' was shot back to back,<ref name="times">{{cite news|title=Longer spell at box office for Harry Potter |accessdate=14 March 2008 |date=14 March 2008 |first=Jack |last=Malvern |publisher=The Times}}</ref> and treated as if it were one film.<ref name="empireheyman">{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=22200 |title=Potter Producer Talks Deathly Hallows |accessdate=14 March 2008 |date=14 March 2008 |first=Olly |last=Richards |work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}</ref> The idea to split the book into a two-part film had been around since the middle of 2007, but only came into serious consideration after producer [[David Heyman]] was able to talk to writer [[Steve Kloves]] when the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] ended and Heyman had Rowling's approval.<ref name="empireheyman"/> Kloves started his work on the script for the second part in April 2009.<ref name="aprilempire">{{cite journal|title=Hallowed Ground |date = April 2009|pages=100<U+2013>104 |author=Helen O'Hara |journal=Empire}}</ref>

According to [[Warner Bros.]] executive [[Alan F. Horn]], it will allow "an extra hour and a half to celebrate what this franchise has been and do justice to all the words and ideas in the amazing story."<ref name="times"/> Heyman described the workings behind the split: "''Deathly Hallows'' is so rich, the story so dense and there is so much that is resolved that, after discussing it with J. K. Rowling, we came to the conclusion that two parts were needed."<ref name="times"/> Kloves was not able to start work on the script until the WGA strike ended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=21781 |title=About Those Harry Potter Rumours |accessdate=14 February 2008 |date=14 January 2008 |first=Olly |last=Richards |work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}</ref>

Before David Yates was officially chosen to direct the film, others had expressed an interest in the job. [[Alfonso Cuar<U+00F3>n]], director of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', had said that he would be tempted to return to direct.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban/news/1656252/ |title=RT-UK Exclusive: Alfonso Cuaron talks Mexico and a Return to Harry Potter |last=Utichi |first=Joe |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2007 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> [[Guillermo del Toro]], who passed on ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', had expressed interest in directing ''Deathly Hallows'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/10/26/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |title=Guillermo Game For 'Harry Potter' |accessdate=26 October 2007 |date=26 October 2007 |first=Larry |last=Carroll |publisher=MTV}}</ref> but an increased workload over the production of ''[[The Hobbit (2012 film)|The Hobbit]]'' ruled him out of the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=21871 |title=Guillermo Del Toro In Talks For Hobbit? |accessdate=29 January 2007 |date=28 January 2007 |work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |first=Olly |last=Richards}}</ref>

People have been so used to seeing Harry Potter at Hogwarts and we're just not there for the first part of the film. That seems to have really freshened things up, and hopefully will get people seeing the films with fresh eyes again, because it's just a totally different look when you're not just sat in the same room the whole time."<ref name="aprilempire"/>

As maintained by producer David Heyman and director David Yates, Part 1 and Part 2 were treated as one film during production, but are ultimately two different films with separate tones and styles, connected only by the "linear narrative that runs through the middle".<ref name="empireheyman"/><ref>[{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Weintraub|url=http://collider.com/david-yates-interview-harry-potter-deathly-hallows-part-1-part-2/60396/|title=Director David Yates Interview|publisher=''Collider''|date=15 November 2010|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> Yates commented on the contrast between the two parts, saying that Part 1 is a "[[road movie]]" and "quite real", "almost like a [[Cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>|v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]] documentary", while Part 2 is "much more operatic, colourful and [[fantasy film|fantasy-oriented]]", a "big opera with huge battles."<ref>[http://www.canada.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Harry+Potter+final+magic/3802811/story.html David Yates: Part 1 "Verite"]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Woerner|url=http://io9.com/#!5611928/find-out-where-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-1-will-end|title=Find out where Harry Potter and the Death Hallows Part 1 will end|publisher=io9|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Hunter|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/if-the-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-two-film-adaptation-were-a-person-this-splitting-point-would-be-the-taint.php|title=If The Two 'Harry Potter and the Death Hallows' Films Were A Person This Would Be Perineum|publisher=Film School Rejects|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2010/1/24/david-yates-deathly-hallows-a-big-opera-a-great-big-epic-with-huge-battles|title=David Yates: Deathly Hallows is a big opera, a great big epic with huge battles|publisher=The Leaky Cauldron|date=24 January 2010|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref>

===Sets===
Stuart Craig, set designer for all of the previous Harry Potter films, returned for the final two parts. He commented, "Inevitably, the book has to be so condensed. There's been a great deal of tolerance on the part of the public <U+2013> at least I think so. I could be proved wrong, still." On the wedding tent for Bill and Fleur's wedding he said, "The wedding tent, where the reception is held, rather than make it an extension of the house, which is rather eccentric, homemade, we decided to make it rather elegant, ... , It's lined with silk and beautiful, floating candelabra. So it's a nice contrast with the house." For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, "This is an underground world; this is a ministry, so we went to the real ministries, the Muggle ministries <U+2013> [[Whitehall]], in London <U+2013> and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries."<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Ordo<U+00F1>a |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/11/12/PK0R1G8TB4.DTL |title=Stuart Craig, Harry Potter's production designer |work=San Francisco Chronicle | date = November 14, 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Costumes ===
The costumes for Part 1 were designed by Jany Temime, who has been the costume designer on Harry Potter productions since ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004).<ref name="hero_complex">{{cite news|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/10/21/harry-potter-countdown-the-deathly-hallows-wedding-is-last-festive-moment-in-grim-finale/| title='Harry Potter' countdown: The 'Deathly Hallows' wedding is last festive moment in grim finale|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date = 21 October 2010|accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> Temime has spoken about a key design: Fleur's wedding dress. She says she "wanted it to be a witch wedding dress but not a Halloween dress. The dress is white but it needed to have something fantastic to it. So there is the phoenix [motif], the bird, which is a symbol of love in a way because there is rebirth, love never dies, it is born again."<ref name="hero_complex"/> Temime has been accused of copying the wedding dress design from a similar dress from [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]]'s Fall 2008 collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionist.ca/2010/10/did-harry-potter-designer-steal-a-dress-from-alexander-mcqueen.html |title=Did Harry Potter's Costume Designer Steal A Dress From Alexander McQueen? - Fashionist |publisher=Fashionist.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref>

===Visual effects===
After working on every film since ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] was asked to provide visual effects for the final instalments of the story, in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1'' and ''2''. Working closely with the film's VFX Supervisor, Tim Burke, the team was led by VFX Supervisor, David Vickery and VFX Producer Charlotte Loughlane. The main team also included 3D Supervisor, Rick Leary and 2D Supervisor, Sean Stranks.

Double Negative's work for ''Deathly Hallows: Part 1'' included the corroding Warner Brothers logo and extensive environment extensions of the Burrows and its surrounds. Additional environment work was completed on Xenophilus Lovegood's home, extending it in 3D and culminating in the Death Eater's attack. Double Negative also advanced the Death Eaters' smoke effects, with the introduction of the 'flayed man' stage in between their smokey, fluid, flying state and their live-action presence upon landing. Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts a wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dneg.com/projects/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_1_283.html|publisher=Double Negative Visual Effects|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref>

Also involved in the production was [[Framestore]], the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[visual effects]] company that produced the animated short, [[The tale of the three brothers|The Tale of the Three Brothers]], directed by [[Ben Hibon]] in Part 1 as well as most of the creature CGI like in previous films such as Dobby or Kreacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/animated-sequence-in-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows.html|title=Animated Sequence in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=20 November 2010|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
{{Main|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (soundtrack)}}
{{See also|Harry Potter music}}
Composer [[Nicholas Hooper]], who scored ''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'', did not return for ''Deathly Hallows''. Instead, [[Alexandre Desplat]] was hired to compose the score for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (soundtrack)|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]''. Desplat composed throughout the summer of 2010 and the recording sessions began on 14 August with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The supervising orchestrator on ''Deathly Hallows'', [[Conrad Pope]], (also one of the orchestrators on the first three Potter films) collaborated with Desplat and commented that the music is "exciting and vigorous" and "those who love melodies, harmonies and emotions in their film scores should be pleased. Reminds one of the old days."{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Part 1 soundtrack was released on 16 November 2010, three days before the film's release date, while a special Collector's Edition with bonus tracks and memorabilia was released on 21 December.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Composer of the first three films, [[John Williams]], expressed interest in returning for ''Deathly Hallows'' if it fit his schedule. Director David Yates stated that he was eager to work with Williams on the score for Part 2, but it was not possible due to their conflicting schedules.<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Sims|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/show/3948|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|publisher=MuggleNet|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> It was confirmed via the Warner Bros. website that Part 1 composer, Alexandre Desplat, was set to return for Part 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/harrypotterandthedeathlyhallows/mainsite/index.html#/synopsis|title=Alexandre Desplat <U+2013>Composer of Part 1 and 2|publisher=Warner Bros.|accessdate=30 January 2011}} (NOTE: Click "Filmmakers", then "Alexandre Desplat")</ref><ref name="filmonic">{{cite web|url=http://filmonic.com/alexandre-desplat-will-compose-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2 |title=Alexandre Desplat will compose Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 |publisher=Filmonic.com |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> In an interview with Film Music Magazine, Desplat stated that scoring Part 2 is "a great challenge" and that he has "a lot of expectations to fulfill and a great deal of work" ahead of him.<ref>{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Schweiger|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=6434|title=Deathly Hallows Composer Alexandre Desplat| work = Film Music |date=9 November 2010|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> Desplat started writing the music in early 2011 and finished recording with orchestrator [[Conrad Pope]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] on 27 May 2011 at [[Abbey Road Studios]], as stated on Pope's official Facebook page.<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/alexandre-desplat-confirms-starting-work-on-deathly-hallows-part-ii-musical-score-79424/ Alexandre Desplat begins to compose The Deathly Hallows: Part 2]</ref><ref>[http://www.facebook.com/conrad.pope/posts/1891857149098 Conrad Pope: Deathly Hallows Part 2]</ref>

The trailer music for ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' features two tracks, both from Brand X. Track one is called "The Sorcerer's Secret" and plays on the first three teasers for the film, while the second track, "Never Surrender", plays on the trailer for both parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/?cid=H&mid=30379 |title=SoundtrackNet : Trailers <U+2013> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part I (2010) |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date= |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> The third trailer, which promotes only Part 1, features three new tracks: Amphibious Zoo's "Ghost of War", Position Music's "Menace", and finally from the Immediate Music company, "The End of Days".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Part 1 featured the song "O Children" by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], one of only two songs in a ''Harry Potter'' film not specifically written for it (the other being [[Boys Will Be Boys (song)|"Boys Will Be Boys"]] by [[The Ordinary Boys]], used in [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]).

Warner Bros. Pictures was originally going to release Part 1 of ''Deathly Hallows'' in 2D and [[3-D film|3D]] formats. However on 8 October 2010, it was announced that plans for a 3D version of Part 1 had been scrapped. "Warner Bros Pictures has made the decision to release "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows <U+2013> Part 1" in 2D, in both conventional and IMAX cinemas, as we will not have a completed 3D version of the film within our release date window. Despite everyone's best efforts, we were unable to convert the film in its entirety and meet the highest standards of quality." Part 2, however, will still be released in 2D, 3D and [[IMAX]] formats.<ref name="Fandango">{{cite web | url=http://www.fandango.com/movieblog/deathly-hallows-part-one-will-not-be-in-3d-645221.html | title='Deathly Hallows' Part One Will Not Be In 3D | accessdate=6 November 2010 | last=Deane | first=Derrick | date=8 October 2010 | publisher=Fandango Movie Blog}}</ref>
