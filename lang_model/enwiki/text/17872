'''Bay Village''' is the second smallest{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} and arguably least-known officially-recognized [[Neighborhoods in Boston|neighborhood]] of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].  As of 2010, its population was approximately 1,312 residents living in 837 housing units, most of which are small brick rowhouses.<ref>[http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthoritynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/NBRHDPercentChange1.pdf Boston 2010 Census BRA neighborhood comparison]</ref>

== Description ==
The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] is the southern boundary of the neighborhood, which coincides with the right-of-way of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Boston and Worcester Railroad]], laid down in the 1830s.  Marginal Road and Cortes Street are the surface roads that parallel the "Pike".  Across the Pike to the southwest lies the [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]] neighborhood; to the southeast of the Pike and Tremont Street is the southern edge of [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]].  To the west of Berkeley Street and north of Columbus Street (west of Arlington Street) is the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] neighborhood.  To the north of Stuart Street is [[Park Square (Boston)|Park Square]], and to the east of [[Charles Street (Boston)|Charles Street]] is the [[Washington Street Theatre District]].<ref>Boundaries of the neighborhood as defined by the Bay Village Neighborhood Association: [http://www.bayvillage.net/neighborhood/bv_map.htm see map]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref><ref name=BVHD-Map>{{cite web|title=Bay Village Historic District (map) |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/Bay%20Village%20Historic%20District%20map_tcm3-13483.pdf |work=CityofBoston.gov |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>

The narrow one-way network and irregular grid arrangement of the streets make the interior urban spaces of Bay Village relatively quiet and pedestrian-friendly, due to sparse automobile traffic.  Most of the sidewalks are paved with brick, and are lit by [[gas lighting|gas streetlamps]] at night.  The exterior appearance of buildings is protected by a Historic District designation administered by the Bay Village Architectural Commission.<ref name=CoBHistoric>{{cite web|title=Bay Village|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/landmarks/historic/bayvillage.asp|work=CityofBoston.gov|publisher=City of Boston|accessdate=2011-07-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110720173231/http://www.cityofboston.gov/landmarks/historic/bayvillage.asp| archivedate= 20 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

There are a few "vest-pocket" parks located within or nearby Bay Village, notably Eliot Norton Park, which although technically located in the Theatre District, is just across Charles Street from the eastern boundary of the neighborhood.<ref name="BVHD-Map"/>  The [[Public Garden (Boston)|Boston Public Garden]] and [[Boston Common]] are located just two blocks away from the northern edge of Bay Village.

Traditionally middle to lower-middle class, the neighborhood has become relatively more expensive and upscale, beginning around the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  The Bay Village Neighborhood Association (BVNA) is very active in controlling urban nuisances, such as traffic, litter, graffiti, and pet wastes (an approved [[dog walking]] area is located next to Eliot Norton Park).  The BVNA is also known for organizing Spring and Fall Cleanup days, a book club, and the Bay Village Annual Neighborhood Block Party (which has sometimes featured restaurant tables and service literally in the middle of the narrow streets).<ref name=BVNA-Calendar>{{cite web|title=Calendar of Events |url=https://www.bayvillage.net/category/events/upcoming/ |publisher=Bay Village Neighborhood Association|accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:BostonMA 1BayStreet.jpg|thumb|left|The [[House at 1 Bay Street]], an 1830 house listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP)]]
The western part of the neighborhood was originally part of the body of water known as the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]], west of the [[Boston Neck]] [[isthmus]].  This area was once known as South Bay, as the original waterline was in the area of Arlington Street (formerly Ferdinand Street).  In the 1820s, the neighborhood was [[land reclamation|landfilled]] by developer [[Ephraim Marsh]],<ref name=Ephraim>{{cite web|title=Ephraim Marsh|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM12VB_Ephraim_Marsh|work=Massachusetts Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> in partnership with [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]], before the more extensive landfills of the adjacent Back Bay and South End neighborhoods.<ref name=ExpBoston>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Carolyn|title=Beacon Hill & Bay Village|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/BeaconHill_BayVillage_brochure_tcm3-19113.pdf|work=Exploring Boston's Neighborhoods|publisher=Boston Landmarks Commission|accessdate=2011-07-25|year=1998| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110720074025/http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/BeaconHill_BayVillage_brochure_tcm3-19113.pdf| archivedate= 20 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Through its history, the neighborhood has been known at different times as the '''Church Street District''', '''South Cove''', and '''Kerry Village'''.<ref name=BVNAHistory>{{cite web|title=Bay Village History|url=http://www.bayvillage.net/neighborhood/|work=Bay Village Neighborhood Association|publisher=Bay Village Neighborhood Association|accessdate=2011-07-03}}</ref>

Architecturally, many Bay Village homes look like smaller versions of [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] [[townhouse]]s.  This is largely because many of the craftspeople who built the Beacon Hill residences settled in this area and built the local residences for their own use.<ref name=ArchArea>{{cite web|title=Architecture of the Area|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM12VF_Architecture_of_the_Area |work=Massachusetts Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> Fayette Street, named for the [[American Revolutionary War]] soldier [[Marquis de Lafayette]], has numerous houses dating from the [[Federal Period]]. Grander five-story townhouses in the [[Greek Revival style]] may be found on Melrose Street.  After the area west of Arlington Street (formerly known as Ferdinand Street) was filled in, developers built luxury residential "hotels" in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian style]] on Cortes and Isabella Streets.

During the mid-to-late 19th century, most streets in Bay Village were raised 12<U+2013>18 feet (4<U+2013>6 m) to prevent flooding as the adjacent [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]] and [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] neighborhoods were created by continued landfill. Newer structures were built to this raised elevation, but many older buildings were modified with new entrances into what had previously been the second floor. Visitors can see evidence of this today by noting the location of the basement windows in some of the buildings on Fayette Street, as well as arches opening to horsewalks that ran under the houses to stables in the rear.  In addition, some private gardens were never raised, and remain near their original elevations.<ref name=Raising>{{cite web|title=Raising the Village|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM17CM_Raising_the_Village |work=Massachusetts Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>

The American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was born at the edge of Bay Village; his parents were both actors in the Theatre District nearby.  A commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is a couple of blocks away from the actual location of Poe's birth.<ref name=Poe>{{cite web|title=Edgar Allan Poe Birth Place |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2MWP |work=Massachusetts Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed "Charles Street South".<ref>{{cite web|title=An Interactive Map of Literary Boston: 1794<U+2013>1862|url=http://bostonliteraryhistory.com/sites/default/files/bostonliteraryhistorymap.pdf|work=Forgotten Chapters of Boston's Literary History|publisher=The Trustees of Boston College|accessdate=2012-05-22|format=Exhibition|date=March 28 <U+2013> July 30, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Glenn>{{cite web|last=Glenn|first=Joshua|title=The house of Poe -- mystery solved!|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/brainiac/2007/04/_a_globe_reader.html|work=boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2012-05-22|date=April 9, 2007}}</ref> A "square" at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor,<ref name=OldPoeSq>{{cite web|title=Edgar Allan Poe Square|url=http://bostonhistory.typepad.com/notes_on_the_urban_condit/2007/01/edgar_allen_poe.html|work=The City Record, and Boston News-letter|accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref> but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston Streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was newly designated "Edgar Allan Poe Square".<ref name=PoeSq>{{cite web|title=Edgar Allan Poe Square |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6AMW_Edgar_Allan_Poe_Square__Boston_MA |work=Massachusetts Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> A residential condominium a few streets away within Bay Village is also named in his honor, but otherwise has no known connection to the author.

{{As of|2013}}, fundraising is proceeding to construct a permanent memorial sculpture at Edgar Allan Poe Square. The winning design depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying [[The Raven|raven]], and trailed by papers falling from his open suitcase.<ref name=PFOB>{{cite web|title=[homepage]|url=http://www.poeboston.org/Poe_Foundation_of_Boston.html|work=Edgar Allan Poe Foundation of Boston|publisher=Edgar Allan Poe Foundation of Boston, Inc.|accessdate=2013-04-09}}</ref><ref name=Fox2013>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Jeremy C.|title=Vision for an Edgar Allan Poe memorial in Boston comes closer to reality|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2013/02/vision_for_an_edgar_allan_poe.html|accessdate=2013-04-09|newspaper=boston.com (Boston Globe)|date=February 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Kaiser>{{cite news|last=Kaiser|first=Johanna|title=Boston chooses life-size Edgar Allan Poe statue to commemorate writer's ties to city|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/beacon_hill/2012/04/life-size_poe_statue_chosen_to.html|accessdate=2013-04-09|newspaper=boston.com (Boston Globe)|date=April 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=PFOB2>{{cite web|title=About the project|url=http://poeboston.blogspot.com|work=Edgar Allan Poe Square Public Art Project|publisher=Edgar Allan Poe Foundation of Boston, Inc|accessdate=2013-04-09}}</ref>

Bay Village was the site of the November 1942 fire at the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|Cocoanut Grove]] nightclub, in which 492 people lost their lives.  Its terrible aftermath led to the creation and enforcement of stringent [[fire code]]s across the US, in the hope of preventing other such tragedies.  Marking the 50th anniversary of the incident, the Bay Village Neighborhood Association placed a memorial plaque in the brick sidewalk near the club<U+2019>s former site on Piedmont Street, now occupied by the Revere Hotel (formerly the Radisson Hotel).<ref name="BVNAHistory"/><ref name=Cocoanut>{{cite web|title=Cocoanut Grove Fire Site|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1836_Cocoanut_Grove_Fire_Site |work=Massachusetts Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
{{As of|2013}}, [[Walk Score]] rates Bay Village as the most [[walkability|walkable]] neighborhood in the City of Boston, which itself is rated the third most walkable city in the US, and has a high Transit Score as well.<ref name=WalkScoreBoston>{{cite web|last=Walk Score|title=About Boston|url=http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Boston|work=Walk Score|publisher=Walk Score|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Bay Village has been assigned a Walk Score of 98, and a Transit Score of 100.<ref name=WalkScoreBV>{{cite web|last=Walk Score|title=Bay Village, Boston|url=http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Boston/Bay_Village|work=Walk Score|publisher=Walk Score|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>

Several [[MBTA]] [[rapid transit]] stations are located just beyond the boundaries of Bay Village, which is also served by several local bus routes.  [[Commuter rail]] and [[Amtrak]] long-haul trains stop at [[Back Bay (MBTA)|Back Bay Station]] and [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]], within walking distance to the west and east of Bay Village, respectively.  Inter-city bus services depart from the regional bus terminal at South Station.

Nearby MBTA stations include:
* [[Arlington (MBTA station)|Arlington]]
* [[Back Bay (MBTA station)|Back Bay]]
* [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]]
* [[Tufts Medical Center (MBTA station)|Tufts Medical Center]]

On-street parking is very scarce within Bay Village, and is mostly reserved for holders of Residential Parking stickers.  Commercial parking is available in numerous surface lots and [[parking garage]]s located near or in the neighborhood.  Entrance ramps to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] ([[I-90]]) and the [[Central Artery]] ([[I-93]]) are a minute's drive away.

==Local media==
In addition to the larger metropolitan [[Media in Boston|Boston publications]], at least three local weekly newspapers are distributed free in Bay Village. The neighborhood is so small that it is often included in the South End or Back Bay neighborhoods. ''[[The Boston Courant]]'' covers the Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, Fenway, South End, and the Waterfront neighborhoods of Boston. ''[[The Beacon Hill Times]]'' has some coverage of Bay Village, and is of interest because of the close proximity and historical connections to the Beacon Hill neighborhood.  ''Boston Homes: The Complete Guide'' has dedicated real estate listings for South End / Bay Village, and also has events calendar listings for the area.

In addition, the Bay Village Neighborhood Association distributes its free quarterly newsletter in the area, and back issues can be downloaded from its website.
