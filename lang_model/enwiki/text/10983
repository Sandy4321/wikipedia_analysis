Above is the ''Bad Girls Club'' [[creed]] which was introduced in the [[The Bad Girls Club (season 3)|third season of the ''Bad Girls Club'']].<ref name="BG"/>

In no season of the Bad Girls Club are the contestants given a televsion set. The girls are also allowed to have frequent visitors to see them.<ref name="BG"/> The girls must go through tough situations such as fights ([[arguments]], [[Spitting|spit at]], [[food fight]]s, [[Bullying|breaking of personal belongings]], and [[personal attacks]]) and physical fighting such as physically touching another "bad girl" with intentions of hurting that person, which is seen throughout each season.<ref name="BG"/> The girls are thrown in the house and are there to co-exist and must tolerate everyone in order to "make it" at the end of the season and they accomplish this by staying in the show without being removed or voluntarily left the show.<ref name="BG"/> 

Bullying and tag teaming are seen throughout the series of the ''Bad Girls Club'' due to making personal friends and "having ones back" or if a group of girls dislike another they would form a way to make sure that the other girl is gone within a day of bullying.<ref name="BG"/> At the end of the show, some girls change their ways, looks at life in a different perspective, builds a back-bone, or becomes a [[role model]] which are the key results in the show.<ref name="BG">{{cite web |url=http://bad-girls-club.oxygen.com/about-the-bad-girls-club |title=About the "Bad Girls Club" |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Oxygen.com |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> 

In each season, when a "bad girl" is removed or leaves on her own terms, a collage of memorable videos of that "bad girl" is played shortly after her leave. Notability, the memorable videos are a collage of situations that the "bad girl" was in or was most notable as.

=== Season's 1 and 2 ===
The format for the [[The Bad Girls Club (season 1)|first season]] of the ''Bad Girls Club'' was largely different from subsequent seasons. A total of seven [[rebellious]] women, between the ages of 21 and 31, moved in as groups into a luxurious mansion in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The seven girls were also given contracts to maintain their good behaviors during the production of the show, along with a number one rule of the house, no physical violence towards roommates and producers. Season's one and [[The Bad Girls Club (season 2)|season two]] "bad girls" were not given [[nickname]]s, unlike future seasons where producers gave nicknames to all the bad girls who entered the show. During the process of season 1, a record number of "replacements" (who helped filled in, when an original bad girl is removed or left on her own terms) entered the show. On average, around one or two "bad girls" enters the show during episodes three and six. Season 1, however, had multiple replacements, which wasn't seen until [[The Bad Girls Club (season 5)|season 5]], within episodes two and ten. In the first episode aired, the producers first showed a physical fight that led up to ''Ripsi's'' removal from the show, this demostration became a pinpoint for every season of the Bad Girls Club. Season 1 was the first season to have 30 minute episodes and a total of 24 episodes in a season.<ref name="episodeguide">{{Cite episode |title=Episodes of The Bad Girls Club |episodelink=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/the-bad-girls-club/?ipp=40 |url= |network=[[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes=60 |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=English}}</ref>

Season 2's format changed drastically when the maximum age requirements dropped from 35 to 27, compared from season one. The "bad girls" of season 2 moved into the remodeled luxurious mansion that was given to season one girls in Los Angeles. The changing of mansion style, size, and structure became an incessant change in subsequent seasons. The seven girls were given monitory [[Voluntary association|non-profit job]]s to help them build a [[work ethic]] along with stability of being dependent on others, such as [[teamwork]] and commitment for success in later life. Failed to come at work or quit, was a monitory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, [[decision making]], and build [[cooperation]]. Season 2 became the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to give jobs for the "bad girls" and season 2 also became the final season to air 30 minute episodes.<ref name="episodeguide"/>

=== Replacement ''Bad Girls'' ===
In some cases, some "bad girls" may wish to leave the show due to [[court]], [[Dysfunctional family|issues at home]], think that they are better than the others or mostly due to the fact that some could not deal with the tensions and [[Stress (biology)|stress]] that the roommates were performing, such as [[bullying]], [[Practical joke|pranks]], and double tagging a "bad girl".<ref name="BG"/> A replacement is usually introduced in the house an episode or two after one bad girl leaves the show or is removed. The "original" bad girls are then seen [[dominate]] and stick together to try to [[intimidate]] the replacement(s) unless the "newbie(s)", "8th or 9th bitch", or "replacement to a replacement" are just like them.<ref name="BG"/> 

Season's [[The Bad Girls Club (season 1)|one]] and [[The Bad Girls Club (season 5)|five]] are the only seasons of the ''Bad Girls Club'' to have multiple replacements.

=== Live shows ===
On August 3, 2010, during the OxygenLive TV recap episode, re-imagined [[live television]] experience that, for the first time, combined [[List of social networking sites|social medias]] Facebook and Twitter with program content, which allowed fans of the show to submit their own opinions and comments about the show and the seven "bad girls" which were aired on television during the 10 p.m hour.<ref name="#1"/> The debut of season 5, became the final time that Oxygen had allowed live program content from fans to be shown during the 10p.m hour. 

In January 2011, [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] released a [[talk show|live talk show]] featuring season two's [[Tanisha Thomas]] as the [[Presenter|main host]] for ''[[OxygenLive.com]]''. The live show was introduced for the first time during the debut of [[The Bad Girls Club (season 6)|season 6]] to dish out gossip, rumors, confessions, and expressions that some "bad girls" of season six or "all-stars", during a particular episode. In some cases, the "bad girls" are given a [[questionnaire]] of various questions by fans that were submitted in on [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Twitter]] or [[Oxygen.com]]'s [[message boards]]. Mainly, the "bad girls" of season six are welcomed by Tanisha Thomas and are interviewed and questioned by Thomas after viewing an episode that they were involved in.<ref name="live">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxygenlive.com/ |title=OxygenLive.com |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref>
