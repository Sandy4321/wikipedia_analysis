'''Curtis Granderson''' (born March 16, 1981) is an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player for the [[New York Yankees]]. Before joining the Yankees in 2010, he played for the [[Detroit Tigers]] (2004<U+2013>2009). Granderson is a [[left-handed]] batter who throws [[right-handed]]. A [[center fielder]], Granderson is known for being a [[five-tool player]]. He is a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] (2009 and 2011) and won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] in 2011.

Off the field, Granderson is recognized for his commitment to the community through outreach and charity work.<ref name=mlbpa/> Many of his charitable endeavors support [[inner city]] children. He has also served as an ambassador for MLB abroad. Granderson won the [[Players Choice Award#The Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award|Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award]] in 2009 for his on-field performance and contributions in the community.

==College career==
Granderson was recruited by a number of [[college baseball]] programs, and he chose the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois-Chicago]] (UIC), in part because they allowed him to play basketball in addition to baseball.<ref name=quiteacatch/> However, Granderson quit basketball two weeks into his freshman year in order to concentrate on baseball.<ref name=quiteacatch/>

As a freshman at UIC in 2000, Granderson led the [[UIC Flames]] baseball team with seven [[home run]]s and 45 [[Base on balls|walks]]. He followed that by hitting .304 as a sophomore, leading the team in [[Run (baseball)|runs]], home runs, and walks. After his sophomore year, Granderson played in a summer collegiate league for the Mankato Mashers, now known as the [[Mankato MoonDogs|MoonDogs]], of the [[Northwoods League]], where he batted .328 in 44 games, with eight [[double (baseball)|doubles]], two [[triple (baseball)|triples]], one home run, 17 RBI, 28 runs scored, and 15 stolen bases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mankatofreepress.com/sports/x519254238/Making-the-bigs?keyword=secondarystory|date=May 14, 2006|title=Making the bigs: Granderson first player from Mankato Northwoods franchise in Major League Baseball|first=Chad|last=Courrier|newspaper=The Free Press|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

On August 7, Granderson became the second player in franchise history to have at least 30 doubles, 15 triples, 15 home runs, and ten stolen bases in a single season when he hit a double in a game against the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]].

During the 2007 season, Granderson accumulated 23 triples, which led all of baseball. The American League and Detroit Tigers record is 26 triples, a feat achieved by the all-time triples king, [[Sam Crawford]], in 1914. Granderson is the first player since 1949 to manage at least 23 in a single season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/3B_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders & Records for Triples|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref>  Only ten of his triples were at home despite the fact [[Comerica Park]] has seen more triples since it opened in 2000 than any other ballpark in baseball.
