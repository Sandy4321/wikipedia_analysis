The '''S.S. ''Christopher Columbus''''' was an [[passenger ship|excursion liner]] on the [[Great Lakes]], in service between 1893 and 1933. She was the only [[whaleback]] ship ever built for passenger service. The ship was designed by [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], the developer and promoter of the whaleback design.<ref name="ah">{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2001/2/2001_2_24_print.shtml

''Columbus'' was built between 1892 and 1893 at {{city-state|Superior|Wisconsin}} by the [[American Steel Barge Company]]. Initially, she [[ferry|ferried]] passengers to and from the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. Later, she provided general transportation and excursion services to various ports around the lakes.

At {{convert|362|ft|m|0|lk=on}}, the ship was the longest whaleback ever built, and reportedly also the largest vessel on the Great Lakes when she was launched.<ref name = "sw1"/> ''Columbus'' is said to have carried more passengers during her career than any other vessel on the Great Lakes.<ref name="sw1"> {{cite web |first=Brendon |last=Bailod|title=Columbus information page |publisher=Ship-wreck.com  |url=http://www.ship-wreck.com/shipwreck/projects/columbus/  |accessdate= 2008-03-25}}</ref> After a career lasting four decades, she was retired during the [[Great Depression]] and scrapped in 1936 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at {{city-state|Manitowoc|Wisconsin}}.<ref name="bgsu"> {{cite web

==Background and proposal==
{{main|Whaleback}}
The history of the ''Columbus'' is linked with the history of the whalebacks, an innovative but not widely accepted ship design of the late 1880s, and of their designer, Alexander McDougall.  A [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[immigrant]], Great Lakes [[captain (nautical)|captain]], inventor,<ref name="about-whale"> {{cite web
 |url=http://www.abouthegreatlakes.com/whale.htm
 |work=[http://www.abouthegreatlakes.com/ About the Great Lakes]
 |title=Remember the Whaleback Steamers
 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> and entrepreneur, McDougall developed the idea of the whaleback as a way to improve the ability of [[barge]]s to follow a towing vessel in heavy seas.<ref name="ah"/> Whalebacks were characterized by distinctive [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] shapes with rounded tops, lacking conventional vertical sides. Waves thus broke across their hulls with considerably less force than when striking a conventional hull.  Water could also flow around the rounded turrets which resembled [[gun turret]]s on contemporary warships; the superstructure and deckhouses were mounted on these turrets.<ref name = Duerkop> {{cite web | last = Duerkop | first = John | title = Some Marine Terminology | work = Research Resources | publisher = Marine Museum of the Great Lakes at Kingston | date = July 2007 | url = http://www.marmuseum.ca/duerkop.html | accessdate = 2008-03-22 }} (definition 65, <U+2018><U+2019>Whaleback<U+2019><U+2019>).</ref>  The rounded contours of whalebacks gave them an unconventional appearance, <ref name="ah"/>

After McDougall was unable to persuade existing shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in {{city-state|Superior|Wisconsin}} in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the [[SS Charles W. Wetmore|SS ''Charles W. Wetmore'']] to London, and starting another shipyard in {{city-state|Everett|Washington}}, which built the [[SS City of Everett|SS ''City of Everett'']].<ref name="wash"> {{cite web

[[Image:Christopher Columbus whaleback build.jpg|thumb|right|Hull under construction, showing turrets on which the decks were placed]]
The World's Fair Steamship Company ordered the construction of the ''Columbus'' at an estimated cost of [[US$|$]]360,000. The job was undertaken at McDougall's American Steel Barge Company works in Superior, Wisconsin, starting in the fall of 1892.<ref name="seaC">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200410/ai_n16065472/pg_2 |title=Last of the Whalebacks |work=Sea Classics |date=2004 |last=Wilkens |first=Steven A. |accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref>  

The hull framing, which included nine [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], was completed on [[September 13]] [[1892]].

The rounded hull top was then added, followed by the six turrets, which were substantially larger than those employed on freighter whalebacks. The ship was launched on [[December 3]] [[1892]], after which two [[superstructure]] decks were mounted on the turrets along the centerline of her hull to afford access to her two internal decks, one in the turrets and one in the hull below.<ref name="ah"/> 

She was fitted out over the remainder of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished. Her grand saloon and skylighted [[promenade deck]] contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak paneling, velvet carpets, etched glass windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers.<ref name="seaC"/><ref name="bookfair"> {{cite book

McDougall's American Steel Barge Company had committed in the contract that the ''Columbus'' would be built and delivered in three months, making her one of the fastest-built large ships of her time.  The builders further promised rapid loading and unloading, predicting that the vessel would be able to embark 5,000&nbsp;passengers in five minutes, and disembark the same passengers in even less time.

McDougall set up another holding company, the Columbian Whaleback Steamship Company of {{city-state|Duluth|Minnesota}}, to own and operate the ''Columbus''.  She was [[ship commissioning|commission]]ed on [[May 13]] [[1893]]. Her first captain was John McArthur, who had captained other whalebacks for McDougall's firms, starting with the first powered whaleback, the ''Colgate Hoyt'', built in 1890. McDougall was quoted as having said to McArthur, "There is your steamboat; take her down to Chicago and make a success of her."<ref name="mhgl-JMacArthur"/>

McArthur did just that. Painted in all white [[livery]], the ''Columbus'' made multiple round trips per day, sailing along the [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline from the [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]]/Van Buren Street dock to the Jackson Park, site of the World's Columbian Exposition's [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux arts]] "White City" exposition fairgrounds.
