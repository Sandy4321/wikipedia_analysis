[[EMI Music Publishing]]|id=MN0091320}}</ref> In the song, Knowles sings about a relationship that she knows is no good for her, but still one that she can't give up. The song is complete with stuttering beats coupled with her "liquidy" voice.<ref name="s2s" /> Samantha G. of the website [[Examiner.com]] noted that the song returned Knowles to "her vocal acrobats where the singer uses her voice to lay out the blueprint for the songs melody."<ref name="examiner" /> She further noted that the song used same effects as [[Justin Timberlake]]'s single "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]" and was cut out of ''I Am<U+2026> Sasha Fierce'' due to its [[Pop music|pop]] sound.<ref name="examiner" />

A writer of ''[[Rap-Up]]'' magazine noted that the remix of the song which was featured on the mixtape ''Big R&B Ego'' was "potent, but not quite fatal".<ref name="rapup" /> Sonya Eskridge of ''S2S Magazine'' wrote in her review of the song that "we can't help but wonder why it would have been cut".<ref name="s2s" /> Matthew Richardson of ''Prefix Magazine'' noted, "As far as songs that got left in the studio, 'Poison' actually isn't that bad. The song's production isn't loud enough for this to be a single, but Beyonce sounds fine here."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/beyonce/poison-mp3/31785/|title=Beyonce: "Poison" (MP3)|work=Prefix Magazine|first=Matthew|last=Richardson|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref> Recording artist [[Nicki Minaj]] also discussed the song during an interview with ''Rap-Up'' magazine, saying "When I tell you it gives me life, like, it gives me life. Her voice is effortless. It's badass, like, 'I know I<U+2019>m the best.' I love the melody, I love the cadence. It's playful, but it's just so in-your-face. It's dope and it's creative."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/08/10/whats-on-nicki-minajs-ipod/|title=What's on Nicki Minaj's iPod|work=Rap-Up|publisher=Devin Lazerine|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref>
