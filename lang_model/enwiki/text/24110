{{for|the aspect of [[oology]]|Egg collecting}}
'''Egging''' refers to the act of throwing [[Egg (food)|eggs]] at houses, cars, or people. Egging is a [[misdemeanor|criminal offence]] in most areas. The eggs are usually raw, but are sometimes hard-boiled or rotten.

Eggs are capable of causing damage when thrown at [[property]] and egging is often considered [[vandalism]] for this reason. Eggs can break windows and, when thrown at cars, can dent a body panel or chip paint where the shell breaks, leaving an oval outline. Additionally, [[egg white]]s can degrade certain types of vehicle and house paint. Whether or not the egg damages the surface beneath it, dried egg can be surprisingly difficult to remove. Vigorous removal attempts with scrapers or abrasives can, themselves, damage the egged surface.

A nurse was blinded in one eye when an egg was thrown at her from a passing car in March 2008 in Dublin.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/courts/youth-blinded-nurse-in-egging-attack-from-car-1935802.html Youth blinded nurse in 'egging' attack from car], Conor Gallagher, ''[[Irish Independent]]'', 6 November 2009</ref> A boy in Long Island also lost sight in one eye after teens from a local high school threw eggs out of a passing car on Halloween 2005.

Victims of egging may be entitled to compensation commensurate with the cost of repairs to mend damaged property due to the egging, common charges involved with eggings are damage to property, vandalism and may be liable to nuisance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/872086-nottingham-riots-11-year-old-girl-facing-criminal-damage-charges | title=Nottingham riots: 11-year-old girl facing criminal damage charges | publisher=Metro UK | date=11 August 2011 | accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> In some more serious cases where injuries due to egging is presented, perpetrators may be charged with assault and fined.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/2008/10/15/what-happens-to-people-caught-egging-2/ | title=What happens to people caught egging? | publisher=Seattle PI | accessdate=August 21, 2011 | first=Casey | last=McNerthney | date=15 October 2008}}</ref> Egging is sometimes associated with certain events and holidays. In parts of England and the United States October 30 is referred to as "[[Mischief Night]]," where mischievous teens rub soap bars on car windows, throw eggs at houses, adorn trees with toilet paper, and run away after ringing doorbells. In some areas of Queens, New York, Cabbage Night involved throwing rotten fruit at various neighbors, cars, and buses. Pre-teens and teens would fill eggs with [[Veet|Neet]] and [[Nair (hair removal)|Nair]] and throw them at unsuspecting individuals.

== As protest ==
Eggs are sometimes thrown at people as a form of [[protest]] as they are inexpensive and nonlethal yet at the same time very messy when broken. High-profile people that have been egged as a form of protest include [[Steve Ballmer]],<ref>[http://gizmodo.com/391736/steve-ballmer-egged-in-hungary Steve Ballmer: Steve Ballmer Egged in Hungary!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/09/03/arnold.recall/index.html | work=CNN | title=Schwarzenegger vows 'people's takeover' of Sacramento | date=2003-09-03 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> [[John Prescott]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bofunk.com/video/648/egg_head.html | title=Egg Head | publisher=bofunk.com | accessdate=2006-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1335000/1335033.stm | title=Prescott sees red | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=17 May 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1335000/1335107.stm | title=Prescott 'regrets' blow | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=17 May 2001}}</ref> [[Nick Griffin]],<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/09/nick-griffin-bnp-pelted-eggs The Guardian]</ref> [[David Blaine]],<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/article996690.ece TimesOnline]</ref> and [[Richard Prebble]].<ref>[http://data.filmarchive.org.nz/search/details_film.php?ref_no=F94566&result_no=5 NZ Eyewitness News, 31 August 1988]</ref> Irish bank [[Allied Irish Banks|AIB]] was egged in response to the Irish banking crisis of 2009.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/aibeggs.html AIB bank in Cork egged by man in suit]</ref> The [[Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament]] was egged by deputies inside the [[Ukrainian parliament]] on April 27, 2010 as a protest against a [[Russia<U+2013>Ukraine gas disputes#2010 gas agreement|natural gas agreement]].<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/65103/ Ukrainian parliament ratifies agreement extending Russian Black Sea Fleet's presence in Crimea], [[Kyiv Post]] (April 27, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/65113/ Oppositional deputies throw eggs in Lytvyn], [[Kyiv Post]] (April 27, 2010)</ref> During the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] candidate [[Viktor Yanukovych]] was rushed to hospital after he had been hit with an egg (while government officials claimed he was hit by a brick) which became a source of ridicule.<ref name=RIO>Revolution in Orange, [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], ISBN 0-87003-221-6 (page 58 + 59 written by [[Taras Kuzio]])</ref>
