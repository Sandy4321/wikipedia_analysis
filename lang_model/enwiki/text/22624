{{spanish name 2|Iniesta|Luj<U+00E1>n}}
'''Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta Luj<U+00E1>n''' (tambien llamado puto amo)(born 11 May 1984 in [[Fuentealbilla]], [[Albacete (province)|Albacete]], [[Castile-La Mancha]]) is a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[association football|football]] [[Midfielder|attacking midfielder]] who plays for [[FC Barcelona]]. His willingness to play anywhere on the pitch, coupled with a natural humility, has earned him the sobriquet ''El Ilusionista'', ''El Anti-Gal<U+00E1>ctico'' and most recently ''San Andr<U+00E9>s''<ref>http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/138/spain/2009/05/07/1250897/barcelona-hero-andres-iniesta-in-raptures-after-breaking-chelsea-</ref> or ''Don Andr<U+00E9>s''  from the Catalan press.<ref>http://euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/players/player=58031/index.html</ref> 

==Club career==
===Early career===
Initially, the 12-year-old Iniesta's parents travelled to Barcelona and took a look at the FC Barcelona youth school, [[La Masia]]. The trip resulted in Iniesta's enrolment in the Bar<U+00E7>a youth ranks. Like fellow La Masia graduate [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]], Iniesta originally started as a ''volante'' or holding midfielder<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> but his balance, close control and skill on the ball saw him make progress as an attacking midfielder. From that moment on he worked his way up the club ranks. [[Louis van Gaal]] handed him his debut on 29 October 2002, a [[UEFA Champions League]] game against [[Club Brugge K.V.]] He appeared eleven times in the league in [[La Liga 2003<U+2013>04|2003-04]], mostly as a deputy for [[Camp Nou]] favourite [[Ronaldinho]], scoring once as Bar<U+00E7>a sealed second place behind Ronalado [[Valencia CF]].

===2004-2007===
In the [[La Liga 2004<U+2013>05|2004-05]] season Iniesta successfully secured a permanent slot in the first team and figured in 37 of 38 league games &mdash; more than any other player. He displayed an unselfish attitude by regularly aiding forwards [[Samuel Eto'o]] and Ronaldinho but performed poorly in front of goal &mdash; denied by the woodwork on several occasions, he found the net just twice.

[[File:Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta 21dec2006.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta 2006]] 
Iniesta's improvement as a player continued in the [[La Liga 2005<U+2013>06|2005-06]] season, and because of the absence of [[Xavi]] due to injury, he was given regular starts in midfield. The increased playing time offered to him at the highest level gave him the opportunity to blossom into a superb midfielder. His contribution to the team was praised by manager [[Frank Rijkaard]] as Barcelona won a league and Champions League double.

The [[La Liga 2006<U+2013>07|2006-07]] season saw Iniesta's profile continue to rise and earned plaudits for his willingness to play in any position for his team. On August 22, 2006 Andres lifted the [[Joan Gamper Trophy]] as the captain of the team after defeating German side [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 4-0. He played for the first time as a striker for Barcelona in two Champions League matches against [[Levski Sofia]], finding the net twice. In the first knock out stage of the same competition, he played at left-back against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Despite being moved around the pitch by manager [[Frank Rijkaard]], the 2006-07 season remains Iniesta's highest scoring thus far.

According to the Spanish football magazine ''[[Don Bal<U+00F3>n]]'', a member of [[European Sports Magazines]], Iniesta has been one of the most consistent performers in the last two seasons of Primera Division, placing fifth in 2006-2007,<ref>{{cite web

===2008-present===
[[File:Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta - 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Iniesta training with Barcelona.]]
On 24 September 2008, Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta was chosen as one of the new Barcelona captains, with the former vice-captain, [[Ronaldinho]], departing for [[A.C. Milan]]. According to local newspaper, ''[[El Mundo Deportivo]]'', Iniesta will be the [[FC Barcelona|Bar<U+00E7>a]] fourth-choice captain, behind fellow Spaniards, [[Carles Puyol]] (1st-choice), [[Xavi]] (second-choice), and [[V<U+00ED>ctor Vald<U+00E9>s]] (third-choice). This new achievement by Iniesta has been welcomed by all ''[[Supporters of FC Barcelona|Cul<U+00E9>s]]'' worldwide, and, especially, by the pro-Barcelona press throughout Spain. In mid November 2008, Iniesta suffered a leg injury and was expected to return to action in 6 weeks. Iniesta, however, did not want to come back until he was 100 percent and finally returned to action on January 3, 2009 as a 65th minute substitute against [[RCD Mallorca]]. After only 10 minutes he scored a crucial goal and completed a Barcelona comeback in front of the [[Camp Nou]].<ref>{{cite web

On 5 February, Iniesta made his 250th appearance for Barcelona in the [[Copa del Rey]] match against Mallorca. Iniesta once again got injured in Barcelona's home match against [[M<U+00E1>laga CF]], but returned to action for the first leg Champions League quarter-final clash against Bayern Munich, which Barcelona won 4-0.

His current contract with Barcelona ends in June 2014.<ref>[http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=player&Id=582&pn=Andr%C3%A9s_Iniesta_Luj%C3%A1n www.footballdatabase.com]</ref> On July 19 2007, he was linked with a move to rivals [[Real Madrid]], with reports in newspapers suggesting Real was prepared to pay <U+20AC>60 million for him,<ref>[http://www.ontheminute.com/news/news.php?news=6919 Real Madrid chasing Barcelona midfielder Iniesta]</ref> which would trigger his release clause. Iniesta disregarded the rumours and reiterated his desire to remain with Bar<U+00E7>a by saying ''"I can<U+2019>t do anything about it but I<U+2019>d like to insist once again that I want to stay here. When I say I want to retire in Bar<U+00E7>a, I say it with all my heart."''<ref>[http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/futbol/temporada07-08/07/n070719101316.html FCBarcelona.cat]</ref> Iniesta's release clause has since been raised to <U+20AC>150 million, to dissuade possible suitors.

Teammate [[Samuel Eto'o]] described Iniesta as being 'the best player in the world; whenever Iniesta is on the pitch he creates a spectacle<U+2019>.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1173336/Samuel-Etoo-exclusive-Sign-team-England-Why-I-quit-best.html</ref>

On 6 May 2009, Iniesta scored the equalizing goal of Barcelona's semi-final against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the third minute of injury time to send Barcelona through to the [[2009 UEFA Champions League Final]] against defending champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8010840.stm|title=Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (agg 1-1) |date=6 May 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> in which he had a very influential role as his team went on to win 2-0. He provided the assist for the first goal scored by Samuel Eto'o.

He played an influential part in the Champion league final against Manchester United,which Barcelona won 2-0. After the game Wayne Rooney described him as the best player in the world.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/5398387/Manchester-United-v-Barcelona-Wayne-Rooney-backs-Andres-Iniesta-for-Ballon-dOr.html</ref>

==International career==
[[Image:Espa<U+00F1>a Suecia inicio Iniesta.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Iniesta playing for Spain during [[Euro 2008]]]]
Iniesta burst on to the international scene in 2001, helping [[Spain national football team|Spain]] win the [[UEFA]] European Under-16 Championship, and was in the squad that claimed the UEFA European Under-19 Championship the following year. Since then, he became a regular choice for the then youth coach [[Juan Santisteban]]. In 2003 he formed part of the Spanish side that reached the [[FIFA World Youth Championship]] final in the [[United Arab Emirates]], and was named in the [[FIFA]] all-star team. During his spell with the [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain U21s]] side, Iniesta was named captain on several occasions.

Originally a fringe player, he was called up to represent [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] on 15 May 2006, much to the surprise of many. Iniesta won his first [[cap (sport)|cap]] for [[Spain national football team|Spain]] when he was brought on at half-time in a friendly against [[Russian national football team|Russia]] on 27 May 2006.

He scored his first goal for Spain in a friendly against [[England national football team|England]] on 7 February 2007. His long range effort, hitting the underside of the crossbar on the way in, gave Spain the lead on 63 minutes. Iniesta proceeded to play a pivotal part in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008 by scoring goals against the likes of Sweden and by assisting the strikers. Iniesta usually played in the middle of the pitch, but he was also trusted with roles further up the pitch when Spain was away from home, most notably in the game against Denmark where he was given an advanced left wing position.

Iniesta was selected in Spain's squad for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] in Austria and Switzerland. Though a stomach bug somewhat hampered his performances, he still played an integral part in the midfield. He played in the first two of Spain's group stage matches and proved an important part of the team providing a particularly notable pass for [[David Villa]]'s second goal against Russia. He was not rested, unlike most of Spain's regulars, for the final group game against Greece (which Spain won 2-1 thanks to a fantastic volley from [[Rub<U+00E9>n de la Red]] and a late winner from [[Daniel G<U+00FC>iza]]), and returned for the quarter final as Spain beat Italy on Penalties. Iniesta was substituted before the penalties as in his other starts. In the semi-final against Russia he played the entire 90 minutes and produced a quality cross which [[Xavi]] converted to opening the scoring. The Technical Study Group named him the Man of the Match <ref>[http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/fanzone/motm/match=301698/index.html euro2008.uefa.com - Fanzone]</ref>.
He played the full duration of the [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|final]]  in [[Spain national football team|Spain's]] 1&ndash;0 win over [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament alongside fellow Spain midfielders Xavi, [[Cesc F<U+00E0>bregas]] and [[Marcos Senna]] and 5 other teammates.

==Personal life==
Iniesta's mother used to work as a maid in Hotel Rambla, and his father is a retired bricklayer who now handles Iniesta's club career choices. Iniesta has a cousin named Javier Gaston Alberto who is 14 years old and currently plays as a striker for one of the Barcelona youth teams and is considered a prospect for the future.
