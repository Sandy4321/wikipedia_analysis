'''Rivaldo V<U+00ED>tor Borba Ferreira''' (born 19 April 1972 in [[Paulista]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Brazil]]), commonly known simply as '''Rivaldo''', is a Brazilian professional [[association football|footballer]] who currently plays for Uzbek side [[Bunyodkor]]. He was widely considered one of the finest [[playmaker]]s in the modern history of the game. An [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]]. He most notably played five years with [[Spain|Spanish]] club [[FC Barcelona]], with whom he won the 1998 and 1999 Spanish [[La Liga]] championship and the 1998 [[Copa del Rey]]. Between 1993 and 2003, Rivaldo played 74 matches and scored 34 goals for the [[Brazil national football team]] and was a part of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] winning Brazilian team.

In 1999, Rivaldo was honoured as [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and [[European Footballer of the Year]]. He was named by [[Pel<U+00E9>]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|125 Greatest Living Footballers]] at a [[FIFA]] Awards Ceremony in 2004. He is also the president of [[Mogi Mirim Esporte Clube]] in his native Brazil.

== Biography ==
Rivaldo had an extremely poor upbringing in the ''[[favelas]]'' of the port town of [[Recife]]. His physical appearance still marks the poverty he experienced in his childhood: [[malnutrition|malnourishment]]-caused [[Genu varum|bowleggedness]] and the loss of several teeth. Rivaldo's father Romildo was killed in a road accident in 1989, but Rivaldo went on to his first professional contract later that year.<ref name="overcoming">Mike Lee, [http://www.britishcouncil.org/japan-sport-footballculture-players-rivaldo-greatest.htm Overcoming Tragedy to be the Greatest], ''[[British Council]]''</ref>

=== Beginnings in Brazil ===
Rivaldo began his professional career at the age of 16, when he signed with Paulista, from Pernambuco, in 1989,<ref name="father">[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/news/newsid=74934.html Rivaldo: In the name of the father], ''[[FIFA]]'', October 10, 2000</ref> despite the Paulista coaches believing him too physically weak to succeed.<ref name="overcoming"/> He went on to play for [[Santa Cruz Futebol Clube|Santa Cruz]] in 1991. In 1992, he moved south to the state of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] where he played for [[Mogi Mirim Esporte Clube|Mogi Mirim]] in the second tier of Brazilian football. It was for Mogi Mirim that he made his claim to fame: in a 1993 [[Campeonato Paulista|S<U+00E3>o Paulo State Championship]] match against [[Bauru]] team [[Esporte Clube Noroeste|Noroeste]], as soon as the referee whistled for the beginning of the match, Rivaldo noticed the Noroeste goalkeeper ahead of his position and scored the opening goal by lobbing the ball over the keeper, shooting from the midfield circle.

In 1993, the forward moved to the state capital to play for [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie A|first division]]. In the same year, he debuted for the [[Brazilian national football team]], scoring the only goal in a [[friendly match]] against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].<ref>http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/rivaldo-intlg.html</ref>

In the next year, he switched local allegiances and moved to [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], helping the club successfully defend its league championship in 1994. In both 1993 and 1994, he was honoured by the authoritative publication ''[[Placar Magazine]]'' with the [[Bola de Ouro|Bola de Prata]] for the best player in his field position. He was selected to represent Brazil at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. The Brazilian team won the [[bronze medal]], but Rivaldo was made the [[scape-goat]] for Brazil's semi-final defeat to [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and was excluded from the Brazilian national team by national team manager [[Mario Zagallo]].<ref name="father"/>

=== Transfer to Europe ===
Before the 1996 Olympics, [[Parma F.C.|AC Parma]] announced that they had signed Rivaldo and his teammate [[Alexandre da Silva Mariano|Amaral]] from Palmeiras.<ref name='The Independent 1996-06-27'>{{cite news | title=Sousa for Chelsea| date=1996-06-27| publisher=Independent News & Media| url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960627/ai_n14046663 | work =The Independent | accessdate = 2008-02-15}}</ref> After the Olympics, there was a dispute, and rather than [[Italy]], Rivaldo moved to [[Spain]] as he joined [[Deportivo de La Coru<U+00F1>a|Deportivo La Coru<U+00F1>a]] in [[La Liga]]. He only stayed for one season, but nonetheless a very successful one for both him and the club. Rivaldo was the fourth top goal scorer of the season with 21 goals (tied) in 41 matches as Deportivo finished third in the league. Rivaldo moved on to league rivals [[FC Barcelona]] in 1997 in a [[transfer deal]] securing Deportivo a 4000 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (around $26 million) transfer fee.<ref name="father"/>

In his first season at Barcelona, he was the second top goal scorer with 19 goals in 34 matches, as Barcelona won [[The Double]] of [[La Liga]] championship and [[Copa del Rey]]. Rivaldo returned to the Brazilian national team for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], where he scored three goals, including two in the 3-2 quarter-final win against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. Rivaldo had not been a part of the triumphant Brazilian team at the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 1997|1997 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica tournament]], but was a key player in the successful defence of that title at the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 1999|1999 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Rivaldo earned himself the distinction as top scorer of the tournament with five goals, one being the equaliser from a trademark free-kick in a 2-1 win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the quarter-finals, and two in the 3-0 victory over [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the final. He was named the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the tournament.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 1999, he won another La Liga title with Barcelona, and was again the second most scoring player in the league. In 1999, Rivaldo won both the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and [[European Footballer of the Year]] awards. In his third season in Barcelona, Rivaldo fell out with manager [[Louis van Gaal]], when he insisted to play as a playmaker, and not on the left wing.<ref>[http://www.4thegame.com/wanadoo/news/story/70237/RIVALDO+NOT+A+HAPPY+NOU+CAMP-ER.html RIVALDO NOT A HAPPY NOU CAMP-ER], ''[[4thegame]]'', December 22, 1999</ref> Even though he had a strained relationship with van Gaal, Rivaldo went on to score 10 goals in the European [[UEFA Champions League]] tournament, as the club reached the semi-finals. Van Gaal was fired in June 2000. In the following [[La Liga 2000<U+2013>01|2000-01 season]], Rivaldo was once again the second best goal scorer of the league. In the last game of the season, against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], Rivaldo scored a [[hat-trick]] to win the game 3-2. His third goal was a [[bicycle kick]] from the edge of the area in the 90th minute of the game, and is regarded as one of his greatest goals ever in a combination of importance and skill.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2002/story/0,,746642,00.html A star less bright], ''[[The Observer]]'', June 30, 2002</ref> The win secured Barcelona a place in the following UEFA Champions League tournament.

=== 2002 World Cup ===
Rivaldo had been the centre of criticism when Brazil did not win tournaments, ever since the 1996 Olympics,<ref>Rodrigo Amaral, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/england_v_brazil/newsid_2056000/2056726.stm Rivaldo reflects on wheel of fortune], ''[[BBC]]'', June 20, 2002</ref> as he was said to be saving his best form for his club team. During the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2002 World Cup qualifying games]], Brazil's poor form saw the team being booed by the Brazilian crowds,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and in the 1-0 win against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in November 2000, Rivaldo was booed so heavily that he threatened to retire from playing for his country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1031130.stm Brazil questions Rivaldo's role], ''[[BBC]]'', November 19, 2000</ref>

He was at the centre of numerous tugs of war between Barcelona and the Brazilian national team.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In one incident in the summer of 2001, Rivaldo had to play an exhibition match for Brazil against [[Panama national football team|Panama]], commute to [[Poland]] to play a match for Barcelona, and then return to Brazil for a qualifying match against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], all within ten days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The zenith of his national team career came at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], hosted in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He scored in the first five games for Brazil. Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo]] had done so for four matches, allowing journalists to question whether there was any rivalry between the two athletes. Rivaldo denied this, insisting that all he wanted was to be the world champion. His spectacular goal against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the second round prompted Belgian coach [[Robert Waseige]] to name Rivaldo as the deciding factor.<ref>John Chapman, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/brazil_v_belgium/newsid_2048000/2048030.stm Wilmots tells of ref's apology], ''[[BBC]]'', June 17, 2002</ref> Brazilian midfielder [[Ronaldinho]] helped Rivaldo score a crucial goal in the 2-1 win over [[England national football team|England]] in the quarterfinals. Brazil eventually met [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the final, and went on to win the tournament with a 2-0 victory in the final. Both Ronaldo goals came from trademark Rivaldo plays, as both Rivaldo and Brazil made amends for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final]] loss to [[France national football team|France]]. Rivaldo was named by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari as the best player of the tournament.

His early performance at the tournament was marred by his play-acting in the group match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jun/04/worldcupfootball2002.sport16 Scolari: Rivaldo did not cheat] The Guardian June 04 2002</ref> In the closing stages of the match, with the ball out of play, Turkish defender [[Hakan <U+00DC>nsal]] kicked a ball towards Rivaldo, who was waiting at the corner flag. The ball struck his thigh, but Rivaldo fell to the ground clutching his face. The referee sent the Turkish player off with a second yellow card. After a video review, Rivaldo was fined 11,670 [[Swiss Francs]] by FIFA, 1,670 of which were for "costs".<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/05/1022982720138.html Rivaldo fined half a day's pay for play-acting], ''[[The Age]]'', June 6, 2002</ref>

=== Barcelona exit ===
In June 2002, van Gaal returned to manage Barcelona. Rivaldo was released from his contract, and signed a three-year deal with the Italian [[Serie A]] club [[AC Milan|Milan]]. With Milan, he won the [[Italian Cup]] and the UEFA Champions League in the [[2003 in football (soccer)|2002-03 season]]. His time in Milan proved a mutually disappointing affair, often playing second fiddle to Rui Costa. He left the club after a season of very few starts, partly due to injury problems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} He briefly returned to Brazil, playing for [[Cruzeiro EC|Cruzeiro]] in [[Belo Horizonte]]. On July 22, 2004 he returned to Europe, joining Greek [[Alpha Ethniki]] division club [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] after much talk about which club he would join. There was also speculation that he might join English club [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], with Rivaldo stating that he wanted to help them qualify for Europe for the first time. However the deal fell apart because Bolton felt that the demands made by Rivaldo's agents were excessive.<ref>[http://mannyroad.com/bolton-wanderers-rivaldo/08/08/2008/ Bolton Wanderers Hall of Shame: Rivaldo]. ''Manny Road'', August 8, 2008</ref>

=== Olympiacos move ===
Rivaldo scored some memorable goals in his [[2004-05 in Greek football|first season]] at Olympiacos, including a fantastic effort in the [[Greek Cup]] final with a well placed lob from a difficult position close to the corner flag.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Rivaldo also scored two memorable free kicks during the season, the first in the local derby against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and the second against [[England|English]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the UEFA Champions League.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Olympiacos managed to keep the 1-0 lead against their arch-rivals, but Liverpool fought back to score the 3 goals needed to keep Olympiacos from the Final 16, much to Rivaldo's dismay. In the last game of his first season at Olympiacos, the club needed a victory in order to win the Alpha Ethniki championship, with Panathinaikos just one point behind. Olympiacos went on to beat [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]] 0-1 in an away match in [[Thessaloniki]], by yet another Rivaldo goal,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and secured the championship.

Rivaldo continued to score in the [[UEFA Champions League 2005-06|UEFA Champions League the following year]].  He scored a stunning 30 yard strike against [[Rosenborg BK]],<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPMtzWd-rpw] Rivaldo's goal vs. Rosenborg], ''[[Youtube]]''</ref> and against old foes [[Real Madrid]], although this was not enough, as [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] failed to advance from the preliminary Group Phase. In the domestic competitions, he kept the best for the second half of the season. He scored twice in Olympiacos' come-from-behind victory against Panathinaikos, as well as two in his team's 3-0 triumph against second placed [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], effectively securing another title for Olympiacos.  He also put Olympiacos through to the [[Greek Cup]] semi-finals, scoring on free-kicks in both quarter-final games against [[Skoda Xanthi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Rivaldo renewed his contract with Olympiacos for a third and final year, and promised to give his best, despite having turned 34. He didn't wait long to turn his words into actions: He led Olympiacos to overturn their half-time deficit against Skoda Xanthi, and scored both goals for the dramatic 2-1 victory in the first game of the season, winning him the [[Super League Greece|Greek SuperLeague's]] first-ever Player of the Week and Goal of the Week awards.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  In July 2006, Rivaldo announced that the [[2006-07 in Greek football|2006-07 season]] with Olympiacos would be his last in [[Europe]], before returning to Brazil.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5189506.stm Rivaldo to quit at end of season], ''[[BBC]]'', July 17, 2006</ref> However he quicky changed his decicion and decided to stay for another year. The 2006-2007 season was arguably his best season at Olympiakos,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} having scored 17 goals at 27 matches, at the Superleague championship.

=== AEK Athens ===
Rivaldo quit Olympiacos after contract negotiations stalled and signed on with rival Super League club [[AEK Athens FC|AEK Athens]] on 29 May 2007, making the acquisition arguably the best{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in the team's history. Rivaldo finished his Olympiakos career with 43 goals in 81 games played.

At AEK Athens, Rivaldo played under his former Barcelona manager [[Lloren<U+00E7> Serra Ferrer]]. He began his AEK career with a bang, scoring in his first friendly match. European goals soon followed; a penalty kick against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in AEK's unsuccessful [[UEFA Champions League]]<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bunyodkor rivo.jpg|thumb|Rivaldo in Bunyodkor]]  --> qualifier, and a bicycle kick in their [[UEFA Cup]] first round thumping of the [[Austria]]n side [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]]. Rivaldo's first [[Super League Greece 2007-08|Super League]] goal with AEK Athens came through a penalty in their 3-0 win against [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]]. Rivaldo was the [[Man of the Match]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} against his former team Olympiacos, where he had 3 assists and his team won 4-0.
After the end of 2007-2008 season, Rivaldo and AEK initially finished in first place in the Greek League, but after the court case between Apollon Kalamaria and Olympiacos for the illegal usage of a player in the 1-0 Apollon Kalamaria win earlier in the season, Olympiacos were awarded the 3 points in a court hearing, thus finishing 2 points ahead of AEK.

=== Move to Uzbekistan ===
Rivaldo announced on 25 August 2008 to a Greek Sport Radio Station that he agreed to continue his career at [[FC Bunyodkor|Bunyodkor]] in [[Uzbekistan]], effective immediately, after what he described as an "extremely tempting contract offer".<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=566291&&cc=5739 Rivaldo quits AEK Athens to head to Uzbekistan], ''[[ESPNsoccernet]]'', August 25, 2008</ref>

Rivaldo signed a 2-year contract worth <U+20AC>10.2 million <ref name="times">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/owen_slot/article5648354.ece World in motion] [[Times Online]] February 3, 2009</ref> and started his Uzbekistan career superbly with a brace on his debut. He scored his third goal in the AFC Champions League quarter final match leg 1, against [[Saipa F.C.|Saipa]] of [[Iran]] in the match that finished 2-2. He scored in the return leg as well, in a 5-1 victory. On 19 November 2008 he signed a new contract that will keep him in Uzbekistan until June 2011.<ref name="times"/>

Since joining Bunyodkor in 2008, his team have only lost once in the league over two seasons. In 2009 they went the whole season unbeaten..
