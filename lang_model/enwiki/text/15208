Lincecum was selected by the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the NL in the forty-eighth round (1,408th overall) of the [[2003 Major League Baseball Draft|2003 MLB Draft]], but did not sign.<ref name=03_draft>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/draftday/search.jsp?sc=round&sp=48 |title=2003 First Year Player Draft Tracker, 48th round|work=mlb.com| accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref> He decided to attend college instead, and was selected by the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the forty-second round (1,261st overall) upon re-entering the draft in [[2005 Major League Baseball Draft|2005]], but rejected an offer including a $700,000 [[signing bonus]].<ref name="let their hair down"/> The [[2006 Major League Baseball Draft|next year]], he was drafted tenth overall by the [[San Francisco Giants]], becoming the first player from the University of Washington to be taken in the first round.<ref name=uw-bio/> He signed for a $2.025 million signing bonus on June 30, which at the time was the highest amount the organization had ever paid to any amateur player.<ref name=signing_bonus/>{{#tag:ref|The Giants gave [[Angel Villalona]] a $2.1 million bonus a little over a month later.<ref name=signing_bonus>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060819&content_id=1619074&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf | title=Notes: Broken jaw sidelines Frandsen| last=Harvey| first=Coley| work=MLB.com| date=August 19, 2006| accessdate=August 31, 2007}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}}

During his brief minor league career he was frequently named as the top pitching prospect in the Giants organization.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cockcroft |first=Tristan H. |title=Around the NL: Nolasco debuts, Rollins third |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2864079&type=story |publisher= ''[[ESPN]]'' |date=May 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref>
 
Lincecum made his professional debut on July 26, 2006, with the [[Salem-Keizer Volcanoes]] (the Giants' Class A Short Season affiliate) against the [[Vancouver Canadians]], pitching one [[Inning#Baseball|inning]] and striking out all three batters he faced. After his second outing on July 31 against the [[Boise Hawks]], in which he pitched three innings, striking out seven and allowing just one [[Baserunning|baserunner]], he was promoted to the High Class-A [[San Jose Giants]].

On August 5, in his first start in San Jose against the [[Bakersfield Blaze]], he pitched 2<U+2154> innings, allowing three [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (two [[Earned run|earned]]), and [[Strikeout|striking out]] five.

With an injury to the Giants' fifth starter, [[Russ Ortiz]], Lincecum was called up from Fresno to make his first major league start on May 6, 2007, against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. He earned a [[no-decision]]; the Giants ultimately lost the game, 8<U+2013>5.

===2008===
The Giants asked Lincecum not to throw the bullpen sessions typical of other pitchers during the off-season. Manager Bruce Bochy told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that they were being careful with Lincecum because there have been studies that show that pitchers who throw 200 innings early in their career were more susceptible to injuries.<ref>{{cite news| last = Schulman | first = Henry | title=In Lowry, Giants are looking out for No. 3 | work= San Francisco Chronicle | date = February 16, 2008 | page = D<U+2013>1 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/16/SPC6V3GEN.DTL | accessdate=February 16, 2008}}</ref>

On May 15, 2008, after Lincecum struck out ten Houston Astros in six innings, Houston first baseman [[Lance Berkman]] offered his view of Lincecum: "He's got as good of stuff as I've ever seen. ...

Lincecum continued his dominance in the league by starting 5<U+2013>0.  His strikeouts piled up quickly and was atop the Major Leagues in the category through the early season.  However, issues concerning Lincecum's control over the movement of his pitches arose when he walked five batters for the fourth consecutive start on May 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore;_ylt=AqDeINYESIM40WS450vD_xWFCLcF?gid=300531126|title=Colorado Rockies/San Francisco Giants Box Score|date=Monday May 31, 2010|publisher=Yahoo!

Lincecum eventually recovered somewhat from his slump and made the 2010 [[National League]] [[All-Star]] Team. As of the All-Star break, Lincecum was 9<U+2013>4 with a 3.16 ERA over 116.2 innings pitched.  One of his great first half accomplishments was that Lincecum defeated Houston's Roy Oswalt three times in three months.  All three games were pitchers duels.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

On July 15, 2010, in his first start after the All-Star game, Lincecum pitched a six-hit, complete game shutout against the [[New York Mets]].

After a disappointing August, Lincecum came out of his slump on September 1; pitching against one of the league's top pitchers, [[Ubaldo Jimenez]], Lincecum went 8 strong innings of 1 run ball.  This was Lincecum's first win since July 30.  Lincecum continued to improve throughout September, finishing 5<U+2013>1 with 52 strikeouts and 6 walks as compared to the 20/13 ratio in August.  Lincecum managed to win his third consecutive National League strikeout title, he also set a record for most strikeouts by a MLB pitcher in his first four seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100930&content_id=15254620&c_id=mlb|title=Stat Speak: Lincecum, A-Rod join elite company|last=Schlueter|first=Roger|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref>

On October 7, 2010, in his first postseason game, Lincecum pitched a complete game two-hit shutout, striking out 14, against the Atlanta Braves in game 1 of the [[2010 National League Division Series#Game 1, October 7|NLDS]], breaking the all time record for strikeouts in Giants postseason history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=301007126|title=Tim Lincecum's sparkling debut carries Giants to 1<U+2013>0 NLDS lead|date=October 7, 2010|publisher=ESPN.

Lincecum pitched in both Games 1 and 5 of the World Series, earning a win in both. Game 1 of the [[2010 World Series]] saw Lincecum contribute to an 11<U+2013>7 win over the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. After presenting a strong start, he sat out the final 3 1/3 innings as the San Francisco bullpen preserved a comfortable win. On November 1, 2010, Lincecum started Game 5 of the World Series with an opportunity to clinch a world championship for San Francisco. Lincecum utilized all his pitches in throwing 8 solid innings, collecting 10 strikeouts while giving up only 3 hits, including a home-run, en route to a 3<U+2013>1 victory. His victory in Game 5 ended the Giants' 56-year drought between championships and also gave San Francisco its first baseball world championship in history. Lincecum also became the franchise leader for wins in a single post-season with 4.

===2011===
On May 4, he struck out twelve Mets becoming the Giants franchise record holder for the number of games pitched with 10 or more strikeouts with 29, surpassing [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum#Inductees|Hall of Fame "first five"]] inaugural member [[Christy Mathewson]]. Mathewson accumulated his 28 ten-plus-strikeout games in 551 starts over seventeen seasons of pitching for the Giants; Lincecum collected his 29 in 129 starts over five seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Lincecum: The Most Important San Francisco Giant Ever?|author=Manny Randhawa|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/699778-tim-lincecum-the-most-important-san-francisco-giant-ever|publisher=The Bleacher Report}}</ref> On May 21, he threw his 8th career complete game and his 5th career shutout, which he threw against the [http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=oak Oakland Athletics]. Tim Lincecum almost threw his first no-hitter on April 18. He gave up his first hit after 6 1/3 innings. On June 6, he recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the Washington Nationals, striking out [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]].  He accomplished this during his fifth year in the Major Leagues, becoming only the eighth pitcher in history to do so.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lincecum joins elite group with 1,000th |author=Rick Eymer|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110606&content_id=20104984&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|publisher=MLB.com}}</ref> He is the second player ever to have 1,127 strikeouts by his 5th season in the Major Leagues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} He was only 28 strikeouts short of passing Tom Seaver for having the most strikeouts in the first five seasons as a Major League Baseball Player, which was 1,155. In 2011, Los Angeles Dodgers ace, [[Clayton Kershaw]] and Lincecum matched up four times, evoking fans of both teams memories of the days [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Juan Marichal]] traded zeroes in the 1960s.{{Or|date=July 2012}} In those four games the scores were 2<U+2013>1, 1<U+2013>0, 2<U+2013>1, 2<U+2013>1, all going in the Dodgers favor. On September 10, 2011, both men struck out a combined 20 batters. The two appeared together on the [[Sports Illustrated]] 2012 baseball preview magazine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Lincecum finished the 2011 season 13<U+2013>14, despite a top-tier ERA of 2.74 (4th in the NL) and a stellar second-half ERA of 2.31. Lincecum's win-loss record was largely due to his receiving the worst run support in all of Major League Baseball; the Giants scored no runs in ten of his outings and scored two runs or fewer in 21 of them, leading to Lincecum becoming one of only six pitchers in modern major league history to have at least 200 strikeouts, an ERA of below 2.75, and a losing record.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===2012===
Lincecum signed a two-year, $40.5 million deal with the Giants, making him eligible for [[free agency]] after the 2013 season. He rejected their offer of a five-year, $100 million extension. Lincecum's knees started to get sore in 2011, and he felt he needed to lose weight.  He spent the offseason swimming and gave up eating at [[In-N-Out Burger]]. He lost {{convert|30|lb|kg}}, and pitching coach [[Dave Righetti]] felt he "showed up too little." He pitched poorly in [[spring training]], but the performance was considered meaningless.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nightengale|first=Bob|title=Tim Lincecum's struggles a Giant mystery|date=June 21, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/giants/story/2012-06-21/tim-lincecum-san-francisco-giants/55752324/1|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/692EF64o3|archivedate=July 9, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

On July 8, after a second consecutive start where Lincecum was chased out of the game in the fourth inning by the opposing team's lineup, giving up 6 runs and allowing 2 home runs, Giants manager Bruce Bochy stated, "It wasn't good.

==Pitch repertoire==
Lincecum throws a [[four-seam fastball]] at 91<U+2013>93&nbsp;mph, but mostly uses a [[two-seam fastball]] grip which he throws around 90<U+2013>93&nbsp;mph for more sinking movement to get more ground balls. This pitch has little lateral movement, due to his overhand delivery and the speed at which the pitch is thrown. He has a big breaking [[curveball]] that is thrown at a range of 77<U+2013>81&nbsp;mph and breaks away from a right-handed hitter. Lincecum uses a [[changeup]] that he grips similar to a [[Split-finger fastball|splitter]] with sinking two-seam action. His changeup appears similar to his fastball for the first {{convert|30|ft|m}}, but then dives down sharply tailing away from a left-handed batter, with a difference of {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} or more in velocity from his fastball (82<U+2013>85&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/another-look-at-tim-lincecum/ |title=Another look at Tim Lincecum|date=November 18, 2008 |author=Josh Kalk |publisher=The Hardball Times| accessdate=April 9, 2007 }}</ref> The majority of his strikeouts are recorded with this pitch. Lincecum also has a hard [[slider]] that breaks down and away from a right-handed hitter at a speed slightly higher than his changeup (84<U+2013>88&nbsp;mph). With his power fastball and strong secondary pitches, he has established himself as one of the elite pitchers in the game.<ref name=future_shock>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5783 |title=Future Shock: San Francisco Giants Top Ten Prospects| last=Goldstein| first=Kevin| work=[[Baseball Prospectus]]| date=December 29, 2006| accessdate=August 31, 2007}}</ref>

Lincecum is known for his long stride, unorthodox mechanics, and ability to generate high velocity despite his slight build: originally listed as {{height|ft=5|in=11}}<ref>{{cite news| url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=453311 | work=MLB | title=Tim Lincecum Stats, Bio, Photos, Highlights | accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref> and 175&nbsp;pounds.
