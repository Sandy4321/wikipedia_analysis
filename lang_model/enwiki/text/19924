'''DC++''' is an [[open source|open-source]], [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing|file-sharing]] [[client (computing)|client]] that can be used to connect to the [[Direct Connect network]] or to the [http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/ADC.html ADC] protocol. It is developed primarily by Jacek Sieka, nicknamed [[Arne the Duck|arnetheduck]].

As of [[2005]], no official statistics exist to verify the proportion of DirectConnect users using DC++. However, it is generally believed to be the most extensively used by a large margin; administrators of popular public DirectConnect hubs generally agree {{Fact|date=February 2007}} that DC++ is the client used by a significant majority.

DC++ is an open-source alternative to the original client, [[NeoModus Direct Connect]] (NMDC); it connects to the same file-sharing network and supports the same file-sharing protocol. One of the reasons commonly attributed to the aforementioned popularity of DC++ is that it has no [[adware]] of any kind, unlike NMDC <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.12.01/work-0128.html|title=Sharing the Data|accessdate=2006-12-21|author=Annalee Newitz|year=2001|month=July|work=Metro, Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper|publisher=Metro Publishing Inc}}</ref>. 

Many other clients exist for the Direct Connect network, and most of these are DC++ "mods": modified versions of DC++, based on DC++'s source code. A partial list of DC++ mods is given below. Some of these clients were developed for specialized communities (e.g. music-sharing communities), or in order to support specific experimental features, or perhaps features that have been rejected from inclusion in DC++ itself. An example of an experimental feature is [[hashing]], which was initially implemented in [[#BCDC++|BCDC++]] and later adopted by DC++.

[[As of 2002]], DC++ was still not accepted into some hubs because the number of slots is shared by all the hubs that the client is connected to.  When the DC++ tag was added to the client, a hack was to remove the tag in an attempt to mask the identity of the client.

==Hub addresses==
DC++ supports hub addresses in the following forms: '''dchub://example.com[:4012]''', with an optional port, and '''adc://example.com:12345'''.  The dchub:// text indicates a hub using the NMDC protocol whereas the adc:// indicates an ADC protocol based hub.  In the example, 4012 is the port where you can access the hub; the default port for NMDC hubs is 411.

==Derivatives==
An advantage of the open-source nature of DC++ is that several derivatives (mods) have been released which add features to the original client.

Many users send patches to DC++ which are included in future releases, but some features are rejected by the developer. Stated reasons for rejecting a patch are because they are coded poorly, or that the feature is frivolous, abusable or overly specialized, and does not belong in the main client. Examples include: upload bandwidth limiting (many users feel that upload bandwidth limiting is a form of cheating, while other users not using a [[duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]] network connection can only achieve reasonable download speeds by limiting uploads), colorized chat, specialized operator functions (e.g. client/share checking).

The developers of some mods contribute features and bug-fixes back to DC++.

Below is a list of well-known mods and their features:

===BCDC++===
Features:
* Automatic active mode IP configuration (on hubs that support $UserIP2)
* Bandwidth limiting

* [[Lua programming language|Lua scripting]] support
* Winamp, MPlayerC and iTunes "Now Playing" messages (ability to use a command to send the currently playing media file to the chat)

===LinuxDC++===
[[Image:LinuxDC++.png|250px|right|thumb|LinuxDC++ on Linux/Gnome]]

[http://linuxdcpp.berlios.de LinuxDC++] is a [[Unix]] port that is based on the core of DC++. It has a rewritten user interface based on the [[GTK+]] toolkit. It has not been released yet, but it is being developed actively and is available through [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]]. Even though the name implies it is [[Linux]]-only, it works on other [[POSIX]] compliant operating systems, such as [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]].
