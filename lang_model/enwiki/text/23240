{{nihongo|'''Hiroto Honda'''|<U+672C><U+7530> <U+30D2><U+30ED><U+30C8>|''Honda Hiroto''}}, known in the [[English language|English]] [[anime]] and most of the English video games as '''Tristan Taylor''', is a fictional character in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''.

Hiroto Honda, who is in class 1-B at Domino High School, is a boy who became a friend of [[Yugi Mutou]], [[Katsuya Jonouchi]] (Joey Wheeler in the English anime), and [[Anzu Mazaki]] (T<U+00E9>a Gardner in the English anime). In the first series anime, [[Miho Nosaka]] is also one of Honda's friends. Honda plays few of the games that Yugi plays, and does not play Magic and Wizards (also known as Duel Monsters) that often (In the Duel Monsters anime, he duels in the episode in the Noah Kaiba arc against the fourth member of the [[Big 5]], Nezbitt (Soichiro Ota)).

In the manga, Honda starts out as Jonouchi's street thug henchman. Eventually Honda is no longer important to the story. In the manga, Honda at first has a crush on [[Miho Nosaka]] but she rejects him. Honda develops a crush on Jonouchi's sister,  [[Shizuka Kawai]] (Serenity Wheeler in the English anime), and in the second series anime he fights with [[Ryuji Otogi]] (Duke Devlin in the English anime) over her. In the manga, Honda also owns a female [[dog]] named Blankey and has a nephew named Johji. Honda is also a sharpshooter; Honda says in the manga that when he was a kid, he could shoot a 100-[[yen]] piece with a [[BB gun]] from 50 feet. In the first series anime, Honda is the head of the clean-up committee at school and often cites his duty while doing things, which causes him to annoy his friends.

In the manga, Honda gets a crush over Miho, who is a minor character in the manga; Miho rejects him. In the first anime series, Honda's crush on Miho spans the series, but Miho is seen having a crush on [[Ryo Bakura]]. In the first anime series, Honda is Jonouchi's verbal sparring partner instead of his partner, and he is head of the beautification committee at his school, which he dramatically brags about often. Honda recalls that their friendship started after they participated in a [[relay race]]. In the Duel Monsters anime, Honda and Anzu are more or less cheerleaders for Yugi and Jonouchi. His crush for Shizuka was carried over to the Duel Monsters anime.

In the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'', Honda tends to omit [[honorific]]s just like his friend Jonouchi does.

==Naming==
In all of the Japanese versions and in the English-language versions of the original ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga by [[Kazuki Takahashi]], Honda is known as ''Hiroto Honda''.

In the English-language second series anime, the English-language video games, the English-language ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'', and the English-language "ani-manga" of that movie, he is known as ''Tristan Taylor''. In the English ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses]]'' video game, he is ''T. Tristan Grey''.

In translated versions of the manga in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]],  [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as Hiroto Honda. In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version of the manga he is known as Tristan Taylor. In the Spanish dubbed anime he is known as Trist<U+00E1>n Taylor. In the dubbed anime of all of the other [[Indo-European languages]] he is known as Tristan Taylor.

==Deck==
Honda uses a '''Military''' Deck, using Warriors and Machines related to the military theme. Prior to the duel with Rex Raptor, Joey discovers Tristan's cards, including a Lava Battleguard. Joey has a card called Swamp Battleguard, which works well with Lava Battleguard. Joey uses them in the duel against Rex, and they defeat Rex's strong dragon.
