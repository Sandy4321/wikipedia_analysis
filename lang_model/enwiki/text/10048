'''"Be Our Guest" '''is a song written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' 30th animated feature film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]] ''(1991), recorded by American actor [[Jerry Orbach]] and English actress [[Angela Lansbury]] as [[Characters in Disney's Beauty and the Beast#Lumiere|Lumiere]] and [[Characters in Disney's Beauty and the Beast#Mrs. Potts|Mrs. Potts]], respectively. Musically, "Be Our Guest" is a [[Broadway musical]]-inspired song, taking place within the first half of ''Beauty and the Beast ''in the style of a large-scale musical number by the castle's staff of enchanted servants to [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] in an attempt to make her feel welcome.

During ''Beauty and the Beast'', "Be Our Guest" is a vibrant musical number that takes place shortly after Belle, having just recently sacrificed her own freedom in return for her father's, is imprisoned by the Beast and subsequently confined to her bedroom. Hungry, Belle soon ventures into the kitchen, where she is greeted by Lumiere. Immediately, Lumiere leads Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth and the castle's staff of enchanted objects in an elaborate production number <U+2013> an attempt to officially welcome Belle to the Beast's castle, warmly inviting the character to literally "be [their] guest."

"Be Our Guest" has garnered widespread critical acclaim from film and music critics alike who, in addition to repeatedly deeming the song "show-stopping," praised its [[catchiness]], Ashman and Menken's songwriting and Orbach's performance while applauding the scene's ground-breaking, unprecedented use of [[computer-generated imagery]], additionally citing its [[Busby Berkeley]]-inspired [[choreography]] as a strong asset. "Be Our Guest" has since been extolled as one of Disney's most celebrated and popular songs, establishing itself as one of the studio's greatest and most iconic. "Be Our Guest" received nominations for both the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Awards]] for Best Original Song, ultimately losing both to the film's [[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|title song]]. "Be Our Guest" has been ranked highly on several "best Disney song" countdown lists, garnering recognition from [[IGN]], ''[[M (magazine)|M]] ''and the [[American Film Institute]]. In addition to appearing in the [[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Broadway musical adaptation]] of ''Beauty and the Beast'', "Be Our Guest" was performed by Orbach live at the 64th Academy Awards, has been parodied in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' and covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks. 

== Background ==
Originally,  ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', under the direction of Richard Purdum, was not intended to be a musical.  Then-studio chief [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] made the decision to turn the film into a Broadway-style musical similar to ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), Disney's previous animated film, after he, displeased with the film's initial story reel, ordered the film scrapped and restarted from scratch.  As a result, Purdum resigned, and first-time feature film directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]] replaced him.

Following the Academy Award-winning success of ''The Little Mermaid'', Katzenberg asked the ''The Little Mermaid'' songwriting duo of [[Howard Ashman]] and [[Alan Menken]] to write the songs for and score ''Beauty and the Beast''.  At first Ashman, who was at the time writing songs with Menken for a recently pitched film idea called ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', was reluctant to join the struggling film project, but eventually agreed.<ref name= indiewire1>{{cite web|title=Review: Beauty and the Beast 3D|work=IndieWire|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/review-beauty-and-the-beast-3d-is-the-same-great-movie-with-some-added-3d-charm|publisher=SnagFilms Co.|accessdate=29 August 2012|author=Drew Taylor}}</ref>

Musically, "Be Our Guest" is based on a simple melody that was composed by Menken, who initially had little intention of using it as anything more than just a "dummy."  Upon singing the tune and presenting it to co-writer Ashman, Menken discovered that he was unable to come up with a melody capable of surpassing "that dumb piece of music that I wrote initially because it was just right." Subsequently, Ashman wrote the song's lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.comicmix.com/news/2010/10/02/alan-menken-revisits-beauty-and-the-beast/|title = Alan Menken Revisits <U+2018>Beauty & The Beast<U+2019>|date = October 2, 2010|accessdate = May 27, 2014|website = ComicMix|last = Greenberger|first = Robert}}</ref>

Originally, the filmmakers had initially intended for "Be Our Guest" to be performed by Lumiere to Belle's disoriented father Maurice when the character first discovers the Beast's castle.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sfrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=11394|title = Beauty And The Beast (Three-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in DVD Packaging) by Directors: Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise|website = SFRevu|date = October 10, 2010|accessdate = April 20, 2014|last = Mohapel|first = Charles|publisher = SFRevu}}</ref> According to co-director [[Gary Trousdale]], "The song had already been recorded and the sequence partially animated when we decided that it would be more meaningful if it was directed towards Belle" because "she is one of the two main characters and the story revolves around her coming to the castle."<ref name=":12">{{cite web|url = http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=6858|title = Beauty and the beast 3d|accessdate = April 20, 2014|website = Cinema Review Magazine|publisher = CinemaReview.com}}</ref> Consequently, the song had to be re-written and the entire scene re-animated. Trousdale explained, "We had to bring Jerry Orbach and all the other vocal talents back into the  studio to change all references to gender that appeared in the original recording."<ref name=":12" />

The number - which is staged like a Busby Berkeley production, complete with rows of dancing table settings - is the closest thing in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to the bubbly 'Under the Sea' extravaganza in ''The Little Mermaid''."

=== Critical reviews ===
"Be Our Guest" has been universally lauded, receiving widespread critical acclaim, and garnering nearly unanimously positive reviews from both film and music critics. Hailing it as a "crowd-pleasing production number," ''[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]]'' drew positive similarities between "Be Our Guest" and songs from the Broadway musicals ''[[Hello, Dolly!

Several critics have awarded specific praise to "Be Our Guest"'s choreography, comparing it extensively to the work of director and choreographer [[Busby Berkeley]].

While ''Beauty and the Beast''<nowiki/>'s several theatrical re-releases and reissues have been met with generally mixed reviews, critical response towards the "Be Out Guest" musical sequence has remained predominantly positive. Reviewing the 2001 [[IMAX]] re-release of the film, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' Charles Solomon felt that the inclusion of the deleted song "[[Human Again]]" was unnecessary, preferring "Be Our Guest" and writing, "a second major production number simply isn't needed; 'Be Our Guest' is sufficient."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/31/entertainment/et-solom31|title = But It Was Big Enough Already|date = December 31, 2001|website = Los Angeles Times|accessdate = April 17, 2014|last = Solomon|publisher = Los Angeles Times|first = Charles}}</ref> Similarly, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''<nowiki/>'s William Arnold wrote, "On the other hand, it's understandable why ["Human Again"] was cut from the original.

Although vastly critically acclaimed, the song was not entirely void of some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of [[Sputnikmusic]] commented, "numbers like 'Be Our Guest' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware."
