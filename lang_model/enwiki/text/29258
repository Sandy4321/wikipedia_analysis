'''Iona Maclean''' is a fictional character in the [[BBC Scotland]] TV Series [[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]. Iona is played by Scottish actress [[Kirsty Mitchell]].

Born and bred in [[Glenbogle]], Iona is the local shepherdess who is never more at home than when out in the windswept, empty countryside with only her dog for company. In the opening episode of series seven, the laird, [[Paul Bowman-MacDonald|Paul Bowman]], accidentally burns down her home, forcing Iona to move into Glenbogle House. Her new living arrangements force Iona to form a relationship with the laird who, up until now, she's always found intimidating. Instinctive and honest, there's a hidden beauty beneath Iona's layers of waterproof clothing and muddy wellies. But as far as she's concerned she doesn't even register on Paul's emotional radar. However, all that is about to change.
