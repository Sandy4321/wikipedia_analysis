'''Tool''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[Band (music)|band]], formed in 1990 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The band consists of drummer [[Danny Carey]], bassist [[Justin Chancellor]], guitarist [[Adam Jones]], and vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]].

The band emerged with a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound on their first LP when the genre was dominated by [[thrash metal]], and was later seen at the top of the [[alternative metal]] movement with the release of their second  LP, ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'', in 1996. Efforts to unify musical experimentation, [[visual arts]], and a message of personal evolution continued with ''[[Lateralus]]'' (2001) and the most recent album ''[[10,000 Days]]'' (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world. Tool has won three [[Grammy Award]]s, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.<ref name="AllMusic Biography">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:zq5a8qmtbtq4~T1 | title=Tool Biography | publisher=AllMusic.com | accessdate=2006-04-28 | last= Erlewine | first= Stephen Thomas | coauthors = G. Prato}}</ref>

Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transgressing act and part of [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[art rock]]. The relationship between the band and today's [[music industry]] is ambivalent,<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows">{{cite web | date=[[2001-05-23]] | url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=685 | work=[[Exclaim!]] | title=Tool - Stepping Out From the Shadows | accessdate=2006-09-17 | last=Sokal | first=Roman }}</ref> at times marked by [[Censorship of music|censorship]] and the bandmembers' insistence on [[privacy]].<ref name="livewire">{{cite journal

During the 1980s, the future members of Tool all moved to Los Angeles. Both [[Paul D'Amour]] and [[Adam Jones]] wanted to enter the film industry, while [[Maynard James Keenan]] found employment remodeling pet stores after studying visual arts in Michigan.<ref name="livewire"/> [[Danny Carey]] performed as a drummer for [[Green Jell<U+00FF>]],<ref name="livewire"/> and [[Carole King]], and played around Los Angeles with [[Pigmy Love Circus]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Tool Bio: Danny Carey | publisher =Toolband.com | url =http://www.toolband.com/identity/danny/main.html | accessdate =2007-05-08 }}</ref>

It's a wrench.... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve."<ref>{{cite journal |  url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=April_1994--RayGun.html | title=Tool Rules | journal=RayGun Magazine | accessdate=2006-08-27 | date=April, 1994 | issue=15 | author=Zappa, Moon Unit}}</ref>

=== ''Undertow'' (1993<U+2013>1995) ===
[[Image:Screenshot tool sober lollapalooza 93 mtv clip.jpg|thumb|right|Tool's [[Lollapalooza]] 1993 performance was an important step in boosting their popularity. Above the band performs "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]". Left to right: Jones, Keenan, Carey.]]
The following year, at a time when post-[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] [[alternative rock]] was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than ''Opiate'' and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release when they opted for a heavier sound.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/> The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play the Garden Pavilion in [[Hollywood]] but learned at the last minute that the Garden Pavilion belonged to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Church of Scientology]], which the band felt clashed with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being".<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> Keenan recalled that he "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience".<ref name="33 things">{{cite web | url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2002 | title=33 Things You Should Know About Tool | work=Blender | accessdate=2006-09-18 | first=Jon | last=Dolan | year=2006 | month=August }}</ref>

Tool later played several very successful concerts during the [[Lollapalooza]] road show, and were moved from second to main stage by their manager and the festival's co-founder Ted Gardner.<ref>{{cite news |  url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=March_1997--Alternative_Press.html | year=1997 | title=Nobody's Tool | work=Alternative Press | accessdate=2007-04-08 | first=Jason | last=Pettigrew}}</ref> At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], comedian [[Bill Hicks]] introduced the band.

With the release of Tool's follow-up single "[[Prison Sex (Tool song)|Prison Sex]]", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with [[child abuse]], which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: "It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive." The video was mainly created by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his "surrealistic interpretation" of the subject matter.<ref name="hypno">{{cite journal | last=Jenison | first=David | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=December_1994--Hypno.html | title=Tool | accessdate=2007-11-10 | year=1994 | month = December | journal=HYPNO}}</ref> And while some contemporary journalists again praised the video<ref name="sfc94"/> and described the lyrics as "metaphoric",<ref name="much"/> the American branch of [[MuchMusic]] asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the respective music video too graphic and offensive,<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> and [[MTV]] stopped airing it after a few viewings.<ref name="sfc94"/>

In September 1995, the band entered the studios to record their second album. At that time, Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. [[Justin Chancellor]], a member of former tourmates [[Peach (band)|Peach]], eventually replaced D'Amour, chosen over competitors such as [[Kyuss]]' [[Scott Reeder]], [[Filter (band)|Filter]]'s Frank Cavanaugh, [[Pigmy Love Circus]]'s E. Shepherd Stevenson and [[ZAUM]]'s Marco Fox.<ref>{{cite journal

[[Image:Tool aenima cover dedication to hicks.jpg|thumb|right|This version of the ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' artwork shows a dedication to satirist [[Bill Hicks]], "another dead hero".]]
After Justin Chancellor came on board, recording of the already-begun ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' continued. The band enlisted the help of producer [[David Bottrill]], who had produced some of [[King Crimson]]'s albums while Jones collaborated with [[Cam de Leon]] to create ''<U+00C6>nima'''s (later Grammy-nominated) artwork. The album was released in October 1996.

Two-and-a-half years prior, [[Satire|satirist]] [[Bill Hicks]] had died; the album was dedicated to his memory.<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"/> The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks' material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".<ref name="austinkeenanhicks">{{cite news

The first single "[[Stinkfist]]" had difficulty gaining airplay: It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV renamed the music video of "Stinkfist" to "Track #1" due to offensive connotations,<ref name="stinkfist">{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/video/stinkfist/track1.html | title=The "Track #1" Fiasco | accessdate=2006-03-06 | first=Kabir | last=Akhtar | publisher = toolshed.down.net}}</ref> and the lyrics of the song were altered.<ref>McIver, p. 137.</ref> Responding to fan complaints of [[Censorship of music|censorship]], [[Matt Pinfield]] of MTV's ''120 Minutes'' expressed regrets on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.<ref name="stinkfist" />

A tour began in October 1996, only two weeks after ''<U+00C6>nima'''s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia in late March 1997. April 1 saw the first of several [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] pranks related with the band, most of them being initiated by Kabir Akhtar, webmaster of the semi-official fanpage [http://toolshed.down.net t.d.n], announcing that:
<blockquote>"<U+2026>while on tour in Australia, Tool's tour bus was involved in a serious highway accident. Early reports from Zoo Entertainment are that at least three of the band are listed in critical condition."<ref name="tdn - april fools 97">{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/news/aprilfools97.html | title=Tool News: April Fools 1997 | accessdate=2007-03-29 | first=Kabir | last=Akhtar | publisher = toolshed.down.net}}</ref></blockquote>

The hoax gained wide attention and was eventually exposed on radio and MTV. Akhtar later posted an apology, claiming that t.d.n "will not indulge itself in such outlandish pranks in the future"<U+2014>a false claim, as later pranks would prove.<ref name="tdn - april fools 97"/> The tour continued the next day as originally announced. Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at [[Lollapalooza]] '97 in July, this time as a headliner, gaining critical praise from ''[[The New York Times]]'':
<blockquote>"Tool was returning in triumph to Lollapalooza after appearing among the obscure bands on the festival's smaller stage in 1993. Now Tool is the prime attraction for a festival that's struggling to maintain its purpose.... Tool uses taboo-breaking imagery for hellfire moralizing in songs that swerve from bitter reproach to nihilistic condemnation. Its music has refined all the troubled majesty of grunge."<ref name="nytimeslollapalooza">{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903EEDF1738F937A25754C0A961958260 | title=Lollapalooza's Recycled Hormones: Rebellion by the Numbers | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2006-03-06 | first=Jon |last=Pareles}}</ref></blockquote>

Regardless of a decline in popularity of alternative rock music during the mid-90s in the United States, ''<U+00C6>nima'' eventually matched Tool's successful debut, selling equal numbers.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=August_1997--Circus.html | date= August, 1997 | title=Never Wanted To Be Rock Stars But They Are | journal=Circus | accessdate=2006-06-25 | first=Edward | volume = 8 | last=Fruchtman }}</ref> The progressive-influenced ''<U+00C6>nima'' landed the band at the head of the [[alternative metal]] genre: It featured the Grammy Award-winning "<U+00C6>nema" and appeared on several "Best Albums of 1996" lists,<ref name="acclaimedaenima">{{cite web

A legal battle that began the same year impeded the band from working on another release. [[Volcano Records]]&mdash;the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment&mdash;alleged contract violations by Tool and filed [[lawsuit|suit]]. According to Volcano, Tool violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a counter suit stating that Volcano failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. At the end of 1998, Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal.<ref>Akhtar, C15.</ref> In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then decided to sue the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.<ref>{{cite web

Keenan had this to say during an interview with ''NY Rock'' in 2000:

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported ''Lateralus'' and included a personal highlight of the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with [[King Crimson]] in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV described the bands as "the once and future kings of progressive rock", and Keenan stated: "For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like [[Lenny Kravitz]] playing with [[Led Zeppelin]], or [[Britney Spears]] onstage with [[Debbie Gibson]]."<ref name="kingcrimsonminitour"/> 

Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to spell another dormancy for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with [[A Perfect Circle]], the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both fan club exclusive. On [[April 1]], [[2005]], the official website announced that "Maynard has found Jesus" and would be abandoning the recording of the new Tool album temporarily and possibly permanently. [[Kurt Loder]] of [[MTV]] contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation.

In an interview conducted May 2007, Justin Chancellor stated that the band would continue their tour probably until early 2008 and afterwards "take some time off".

==Musical style and influences==
Tool has gained critical praise from the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'''s C.B. Liddell for a complex and ever-evolving sound.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200701120170.html | date= [[2007-01-12]] | title=In Sight/Music & Arts Tool frontman: 'I have not smashed up 1 hotel room' | work=International Herald Tribune/The Asahi Shimbun | accessdate=2007-05-25|first=C.B. | last=Liddell }}</ref> Describing their general sound, the [[All Music Guide]] refers to them as "grinding, post-[[Jane's Addiction]] heavy metal",<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/> and ''[[The New York Times]]'' sees similarities to "[[Led Zeppelin]]'s heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903EEDF1738F937A25754C0A961958260 | year=1997 | title=Lollapalooza's Recycled Hormones: Rebellion by the Numbers | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2006-04-28|first=Jon | last=Pareles}}</ref> Their 2001 work ''Lateralus'' led the All Music Guide to compare it to [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Meddle]]'' (1971) but thirty years later and altered by "Tool's impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread".<ref name="AMG Lateralus review"/>
===Musical style===
A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of odd meter [[time signature]]s. For instance, Justin Chancellor describes the time signature employed on ''[[Lateralus|Lateralus']]'' first single "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]", as 6.5/8 and that it later "goes into all kinds of other times".<ref name="bassplayer052001">{{cite journal |last=Scott Shiraki & E.E.

Beyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his musical scope. ''Bass Player'' magazine attested  to Chancellor's bass playing as a "thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility".<ref name="bassplayer052001"/> As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a [[Wah-wah|wah effect]] by [[Hammer-on|hammering]] "the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep", such as on the song "The Patient" (''Lateralus'' 2001).<ref name="bassplayer052001"/>

Completing the band's [[rhythm section]], drummer Danny Carey uses [[polyrhythm]]s,  [[tabla]]-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to trigger samples, such as prerecorded [[tabla]] and [[octoban]] sounds.<ref name="moderndrummer072006"/>

Maynard James Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'': after his performance during an [[Alice in Chains]] reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as "a natural fit at replacing [[Layne Staley]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/212872_alice21q.html | date= [[2005-02-21]] | title=Alice in Chains owns stage in tsunami-relief show full of surprises | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | accessdate=2007-05-25 | first=Travis | last=Hay}}</ref> Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, ''The New York Times'' wrote that "...both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity".<ref name="nytimeskeenan">{{cite web | url=

According to ''Guitar Player'' magazine, Adam Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar playing technique but rather combines many techniques.<ref name="guitarplayer2001">{{cite web | url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10882659_ITM | year=2001 | title=Mysterious Ways | month= June | work=Guitar Player | accessdate=2007-05-02 | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn }}</ref> For example, the [[All Music Guide]] wrote that he "alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism" in "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]".<ref name="soberamgreview">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:wxfexqrrldae | year=| title=Sober Song Review | work=AllMusic.com | accessdate=2007-05-02 | first=Steve | last=Huey}}</ref> Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a "pipe bomb microphone" (a [[pickup (music)|guitar pickup]] mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a [[talk box]] guitar solo on "Jambi".<ref>{{cite web | last =Forlenza | first =Jeff | title =The Making of Tool's "10,000 Days" | publisher =Mix | date = [[2006-07-01]]| url =http://mixonline.com/recording/projects/audio_making_tools_days/ | accessdate =2007-05-09 }}</ref>

In an interview with Tool, he touched briefly on how the two bands relate to each other:

<blockquote>"Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." (Robert Fripp during a "Tool Army" exclusive interview)<ref>{{cite web | title= Tool Army exclusive interview | url=http://www.toolarmy.com/home/ | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref></blockquote>

Also he stated:

<blockquote>"I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been an influence on them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn<U+2019>t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool."

When I hear these loud, goofy posturing idiots jumping up and down, more concerned about their hairdos than their music, it's just we do not do that, what am I missing? There's nothing to the music that moves me, or compels me to want to sit down and listen to it, which is unfortunate. Maybe I'm just a cynical old bastard."<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=July_2001--Drum_Media.html | date = 2001 | volume= 7 | title= Happy Meals Versus Tool Albums | first=Rod | last=Yates | journal= Drum Media | pages = 32 | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref></blockquote>

==Visual arts==
Part of Tool's work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos, live shows, and album packaging. In particular, [[Adam Jones]] doubles as the band's art director and director of their music videos.<ref name="alexgreyinterview">{{cite web | first = Jonathan | last=Drew | title = MUSIC MEETS ART Name the band Tool's fave artist | work = The Associated Press | url=http://asap.ap.org/stories/575717.s | date = [[2006-05-11]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}</ref> Another expression of this is an official website "dedicated to the arts and influences" on the band, [http://www.dissectional.com dissectional.com].

[[Image:Tool-Sober-video-screencap.jpg|thumb|right|Screencap from "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]", directed by [[Adam Jones]] and Fred Stuhr.]]
The band has released seven music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two, which the band states is to prevent people from "latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music."<ref name="much"/> With the exception of "[[Hush (Tool song)|Hush]]", all of Tool's music videos feature [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] at least to some extent. The videos are mainly created by Adam Jones, often with the help of artists such as [[Chet Zar]],<ref name="LiveDesign">{{cite web | last =Sandberg | first =Marian | title =Tool Time | work =Live Design | date = [[2006-11-01]] | url =http://livedesignonline.com/concerts/tool_time/index.html | accessdate =2007-05-09 }}</ref> [[Alex Grey]],<ref name="LiveDesign"/> and [[Osseus Labyrint]].<ref>{{cite web | url=

The "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" music video in particular attracted much attention. Jones explained that it doesn't contain a story-line, his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described this imagery stating that, in the video, "evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall" and called it a "groundbreaking", "epic" clip.<ref name="soberencephale">{{cite news | first = Greg | last=Heller | title = Weird Album Title for Tool | publisher=Rollingstone.com | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tool/articles/story/5931985/weird_album_title_for_tool | date = [[2001-01-12]] | accessdate = 2007-04-09 }}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' voted it "Best Video By A New Artist".<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/>

===Album artwork===
Responsible for most of the band's artwork concepts is Adam Jones. Their first album ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' featured a ribcage sculpture by Jones on the cover and photos contributed by the bandmembers.<ref name="hypno"/> Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]''<ref>Akhtar, G4.</ref> and ''[[Salival]]''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.happypencil.com/store.phtml?itemId=22&gid=3 | title=Salival Figure | work=Happypencil Store | publisher=happypencil.com }}</ref> featured works by [[Cam de Leon]]; ''[[Lateralus]]''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/columns/stephens/020508.shtml | title= High Art: Alex Grey and the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors | work=PopMatters | accessdate=2007-06-12 | date= [[2002-05-08]] | first=Michael | last=Stephens}}</ref> as well as ''[[10,000 Days]]''<ref name="alexgreyinterview"/> were created with the help of [[Alex Grey]]. The releases earned positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the [[Associated Press]] attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.<ref name="alexgreyinterview"/>

Both ''<U+00C6>nima''<ref>Akhtar, D11.</ref> and ''10,000 Days''<ref name="49thgrammyawards"/> were nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]], but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2006. As art director, Adam Jones created packaging for ''10,000 Days'' that features a pair of [[stereoscopic]] lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones has been a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography and expressed a desire for the packaging to be unique within budget, as well as reflecting '70s artwork that he appreciates.<ref name="newsgrammypackage">{{cite web | publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | title = Tool Guitarist Wins Grammy For 'Best Recording Package' | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=66850 | date = [[2007-02-11]] | accessdate = 2007-04-09 }}</ref>

A lot of the songs are a personal journey for him ... and he feels more comfortable in the shadows."<ref name="plsnews"/>
The big screens are used to play back "looped clips that aren<U+2019>t tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They<U+2019>ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised....
