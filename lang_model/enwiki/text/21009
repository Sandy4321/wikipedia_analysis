==Early life==
By the age of 5, Burke's local youth basketball league had to change its rules so that he would not keep [[steal (basketball)|stealing]] the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball.<ref name=MBDBiOb>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/sports/2011/03/24/driven-burke-is-ohios-best.html|title=Mr. Basketball: Driven Burke is Ohio's best|accessdate=2011-12-17|date=2011-03-24|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Blackledge, Steve}}</ref> He became [[Jared Sullinger]]'s best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated.
