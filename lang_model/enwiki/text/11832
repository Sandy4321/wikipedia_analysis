The '''Royal Gibraltar Regiment''' is the [[national security|home]] [[Defense (military)|defence unit]] for the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It was formed in 1958 from the [[Gibraltar Defence Forc]]e as an [[infantry]] unit, with an integrated [[artillery]] [[troop]].

==Formation==
Initially a reserve force, on the withdrawal of the [[British Army]] garrison from the territory in 1991, it was placed on the British Army's regular establishment and attached to [[British Forces Gibraltar]]. It is formed as a standard [[light infantry]] battalion with a Headquarters Company and three [[Company (military unit)|rifle companies]]. Of these, two are made up of regular soldiers and the other is a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit. HQ Company includes an artillery troop, equipped with the [[L118 Light Gun]]:

*'''Organisation'''
**HQ Company (Thomson's Battery)
**G Company (Regular)
**I Company (Regular)
**B Company (Territorial)

In 1999 the regiment was granted the Royal title. In March 2001, for the first time, the regiment mounted the [[Guard Mounting|guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. In addition to this, the regiment, thanks to its artillery heritage, is also permitted to fire gun salutes from the [[Tower of London]], something that is traditionally done only by the [[Honourable Artillery Company]]. The regiment also has responsibility for the [[Ceremony of the Keys]] in Gibraltar.

==Unit history==
===18th Century===
The earliest verifiable historical evidence of local civilians enrolled to defend Gibraltar dates to 24 June 1720 and by 1755 an armed organisation of local men were mounting guard on the picket line from [[Bayside]] to [[Devil's Tower (Gibraltar)|Devil's Tower]] to prevent soldiers from the garrison deserting across to the enemy. <ref name="1RG.GI">{{cite web|title=1RG.GI|url=http://www.1rg.gi/history/}}</ref>
These men were known as the Genoese Guard and were disbanded at the end of the seven years war. <ref name="1RG.GI"/>
During the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]], 160 local labourers volunteered to take part in the action during the night of 26/27 November 1781. They were tasked to follow the advancing troops and assist in the dismantling and demolition of the Spanish batteries, magazines and trenches. <ref name="1RG.GI"/>

===19th Century===
During the [[Mahdist War]], 100 local men were deployed by the commissariat as transport drivers, known as ''Los Carreteros Del Rey (the King<U+2019>s Muleteers)''. The expedition was involved in several battles with the Dervishes.  During a parade held in Gibraltar the mule drivers were awarded the Egyptian War Medal with a clasp bearing the title <U+2018>Suakin 1885<U+2019>. <ref name="1RG.GI"/>

===20th Century===
During the [[Second Boer War]], in 1900, a group of Gibraltarians offered to ''form a Local Corps of Volunteers''. The suggestion was made that some of the Volunteers might be organised as a Rifle Corps. However the war was over before the Corps was formed. <ref name="1RG.GI"/>
 
====The Great War====
During the [[Great War]] a group of Gibraltarians, volunteered to take up arms for King and Country. Such was the interest that soon some 400 Gibraltarians  joined. This group eventually obtained official recognition from the Governor, General Sir [[Herbert Miles]] on 3 July 1915. Addressing the volunteers at Wellington Front on that day the Governor reminded them that the Corps had come into being not because of any official demand but as a result of their patriotic fervour and of their love and respect for the Crown.<ref name="http">{{cite web|title=1RG.GI|url=http://www.1rg.gi/history/gvc.qxp}}</ref>
 
The Corps was initially based at Orange Bastion, with the Headquarters on the ground floor of what is now City Hall.  Later the Corps moved to Wellington Front. It consisted of four rifle companies, A, B, C and D, each commanded by a Captain, two subalterns, one Sergeant Major, four Sergeants, eight Corporals, two buglers and about 80 men.  The first Commanding Officer was Major G B Roberts of the [[Royal Engineers]]. During the war, the Corps provided substantial reinforcement to assist in the defence of the Rock.  It Corps was disbanded on 1 February 1920.<ref name="http"/>

====World War II====
In 1938 the Governor General Sir [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside]] formed a Territorial Unit which would be of Artillery to help man the anti-aircraft guns on Gibraltar. The Volunteers paraded for the first time on 28 April 1939.  Just before the outbreak of the war, more volunteers were called for and men were allocated to the 4th and 27th Coast Batteries of the [[Royal Artillery]] as well as to the [[Royal Signals]], [[Royal Army Service Corps]] and [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. <ref name="http"/>

On the 2 September 1939, the Gibraltar Defence Force was mobilised. The Heavy Anti Aircraft section was attached to 19 AA Battery Royal Artillery and deployed with two 3 inch guns to the Admiralty oil tanks, on the east side of the Rock.
They fired their first shots in anger on 7 July 1940 and from then on they were often in action against [[Vichy French]] and [[Italy|Italian]] planes, engaging [[Germany|German]] planes later in the war. They shot down their first enemy aircraft, on the night of the 20 August 1940.  The entry in the unit<U+2019>s War Diary reads as follows: <ref name="http"/>
{{Quote box
| quote  = "Third bombing raid over Gibraltar, first plane came over at 23.30 hours and 
was picked up by searchlights at the moment of bomb release.  It kept a steady course and AA fire was opened.  Plane was hit and brought down in the straits".

In April 1942, the Coastal Defence element was merged with the Anti Aircraft section. 
Early in 1944 the force was reconstituted under the Defence Force Ordinance 1943. The majority of volunteers were placed on the reserve list, with other sections disbanded. <ref name="http"/>

===Post War===
On 30 August 1958 the permanent cadre and the reserve of the Gibraltar Defence Force was formed into the Gibraltar Regiment.
The Regiment then had a dual role, being organised as an infantry battalion with four rifle companies and, an artillery troop manning the 9.2 inch coastal guns. <ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|title=1RG.GI|url=http://www.1rg.gi/history/regiment.qxp}}</ref>
This organisation was to remain in force until 1971.  With the departure of the last gunner unit in 1958 the Regiment was issued with four 25 pounder guns and took over the responsibilities of firing Royal Gun [[Salute]]s. <ref name="ReferenceA"/>
  
On 25 September 1971 the regiment was presented with its first colours. At a ceremony held at the [[Grand Parade]], [[Governor of Gibraltar|His Excellency the Governor]], Admiral of the Fleet Sir [[Varyl Begg]], presented the Regiment with its colours on behalf of Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. <ref name="ReferenceA"/>
On the same day the Regiment was granted the [[Freedom of the City of Gibraltar]] by the [[Mayor of Gibraltar]], the Hon [[Alfred Vazquez]] during a ceremony outside the [[Gibraltar Parliament|House of Assembly]]. <ref name="ReferenceA"/>
The Artillery battery was  named "Thompson Battery" on 15 September 1973 in honour of the late Sir Willie Thomson OBE JP, and in December 1975 Thomson<U+2019>s Battery was issued with three 105mm pack howitzers. Following [[Operation Corporate]] the Ministry of Defence decided, in line with its policy of modernisation and commonality of equipment to re-equip the Regiment with new weapons. In late 1982 six 105mm Light Guns replaced the three howitzers and eight blowpipe Surface-to-Air missile units replaced the four L40/70 AA Guns.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
 
On 1 April 1991, the Regiment was reorganised into an all Infantry Unit and took over the duties of the resident infantry Battalion. The re-roled Regiment consisted of a Headquarter Company (Thompson<U+2019>s Bty) and three Rifle Companies of which G and I Companies were regular with B Company and the [[Military band]] consisting of TA soldiers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 
On 21 April 1998 the Regiment performed its first public duties in London by firing a 62 Royal Gun Salute at the [[Tower of London]] on the occasion of HM the Queen<U+2019>s Birthday.  On the 1 July 1998 HRH the [[Duke of Kent]] presented The Regiment with its new Colours.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===21st Century===
In the 21st Century the Regiment has conducted public duties at [[Buckingham Palace]], the [[Tower of London]] and [[St James' Palace]] between 28 February to 16 March 2001. 
On 21 April 2004 the Regiment fired its second 62 Royal Gun Salute at the Tower Of London on the occasion of Her Majesty the Queen<U+2019>s birthday.
The regiment has supplied officers and men for the conflicts in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].  It is in these theatres that members of the Regiment have been decorated with two [[Bronze Star]]s and a [[Military Cross]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=1RG.GI|url=http://www.1rg.gi/history/royalregiment.qxp}}</ref>
