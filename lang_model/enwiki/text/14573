The '''Appanoose County Community Railroad''' {{Reporting mark|APNC}} is based out of [[Centerville, Iowa]]. It is a shortline running to the community of [[Albia, Iowa]], where it distributes cars from Centerville to be put on the [[BNSF Railway]]'s trains.

The railroad was hit hard when the local Rubbermaid plant in Centerville (APNC's premier customer) closed its doors on September 15, 2006. At least 75% of the cargo hauled by the shortline was from Rubbermaid. The railroad is partly operated by the county, and there are a few other industries in the same area, so the railroad may survive.

==Route of the APNC==
The APNC comprises routes formerly owned by 3 railroads: the [[Norfolk Southern]], the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific]] and the [[Burlington Northern]]. Starting from the Centerville industrial park, the APNC runs over {{Convert|4|mi|km}} of ex-BN trackage south, followed by {{Convert|5|mi|km}} of ex [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific|Rock Island]] east. At a point known as Moulton Junction, the two railroads, [[Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific|Rock Island]], met. Today, only one part of two of the original routes through here remain. This is where the APNC turns to the north. Until recently, a switchback was still located at this point, and the trains had to stop, reverse and couple up to their consist on the other end before continuing up the line. This has been replaced with one sweeping curve, and there is no longer an actual junction at Moulton Junction.

Going north, the APNC is now on ex-NS/N&W/Wabash trackage. The line passes over state highway 2, through the town of Udell, and crosses over the Iowa, Chicago & Eastern railroad at grade, before entering Moravia. Here there is a restored station, and a siding, which is used for run-around movements during the railroad's annual excursion train rides.

After leaving Moravia, the line continues north into Monroe County. The next town is Albia, and is also the northern terminus of the railroad. Here there is a small yard, where cars from Centerville are exchanged with the BNSF Railway.

In 2005, a new RELCO locomotive facility opened in Albia, and is directly off the APNC route on the southern edge of town. RELCO leases, rebuilds and repairs locomotives from all around the country. Many different locomotives have been repaired here, including units owned by [[BNSF]], [[Union Pacific]], [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], and [[Amtrak]]. RELCO also receives new locomotives en route and tests them on their tracks, and perhaps over the APNC as well. Some of Montana Rail Link's and Norfolk Southern's new SD70ACe locomotives were tested in Albia before they were put into regular service.

==Other railroads in the area==
There are other railroads that the APNC passes over or travels by. The [[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad]] (IC&E) passes through and crosses over the APNC just a little ways south of Moravia. The IC&E travels between [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. It is the former [[I&M Rail Link]], and even earlier than that it was the [[Milwaukee Road]].

[[BNSF Railway]]'s mainline between Chicago and [[Omaha, Nebraska]], splits in Albia, Iowa. The southern mainline track goes through a cutting and under Albia. The APNC railroad track crosses over this mainline track. This BNSF mainline was once the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]], and even earlier than that it was the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]], better known as the "Burlington Route".

The APNC Railroad ends in Albia. However, the tracks continue on. BNSF owns these tracks and it is their only route to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. It is single track the entire way.

==The APNC's locomotives==
The APNC owns two locomotives. They are both [[EMD GP7|GP7]]s. When they were purchased they were high-nosed, as are most GP7s. Today both engines have their noses lowered about like the nose on a standard [[EMD GP38-2|GP38-2]]. At first the engines were colored red with a white outline of Iowa below the cab's side windows, with the letters "APNC" in the outline. The engine's number was along the side of the locomotive. Today the paint scheme has changed. The engines are still mostly red, but there is a white stripe running down the center side of the engine, and there are white stripes on the front and rear nose of the engine, much like the stripes on the nose of many Missouri-Kansas-Texas GP7s. The engine number has now moved below the Iowa outline (not altered). Bright red "APNC" letters have been put on the white stripe along the side of the engine.

==Excursion trains==
Every July, the APNC Railroad offers train rides from Moravia, Iowa. Passengers can purchase tickets at the renovated Moravia Depot that is right along the APNC's mainline. The train travels from Moravia to Albia. Several different trains are operated per day, and one of the two GP7s will pull them.

The APNC railroad passes through four Iowa towns: [[Centerville, Iowa|Centerville]],  [[Udell, Iowa|Udell]], [[Moravia, Iowa|Moravia]] and [[Albia, Iowa|Albia]].
