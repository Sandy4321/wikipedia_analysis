== Biography==
Congressman Ackerman was first elected to Congress in a special election of 1983.
Born in [[Brooklyn]] to Eva and Max Ackerman,<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/ackerman.htm</ref> Ackerman was raised in [[Flushing, Queens]]. He attended local public schools, [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] and graduated from [[Queens College]] in 1965. After college, Ackerman became a [[New York City]] School teacher where he taught [[social studies]], [[mathematics]], and [[journalism]] to junior high school students in Queens.

Following the birth of his first child in 1969, Ackerman petitioned the [[New York City Board of Education]] for an unpaid [[leave of absence]] to spend time with his newborn daughter. But his request was denied under then existing policy which reserved unpaid "maternity-child care" leave to women only.

In what was to be a forerunner of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], then teacher Ackerman successfully sued the Board in a landmark case which established the right of either parent to receive unpaid leave for [[child care]]. A quarter of a century later, now a Congressman, Ackerman in the House-Senate Conference Committee, signed the report of the Family and Medical Leave Act which became the law of the land.

Ackerman's second career move occurred in 1970, when he left teaching to start a weekly community newspaper in [[Queens]] called ''The Flushing Tribune'' which soon became the ''[[Queens Tribune]]''. Ackerman served as its [[editing|editor]] and [[publisher]].

Ackerman was first elected to public office <U+2014> the [[New York State Senate]] <U+2014> in 1978. State Senator Ackerman was then elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1983 in a special election. Ackerman represented the central [[Queens]] area until 1992, when [[reapportionment]] reconfigured his district to the north shore of [[Queens]] , [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] Counties . Then redistricting in 2002 slightly redrew the boundaries again to its present configuration of communities in Queens and Nassau County.

Ackerman, who sports a white carnation boutonni<U+00E8>re each day, lives on a [[houseboat]] named the ''Unsinkable II'' while in Washington, D.C. and otherwise resides in [[Jamaica Estates, Queens|Jamaica Estates]], Queens with his wife Rita. The Ackermans have three children: Lauren, who married Paul, Corey, who married Lena, and Ari. Representative Ackerman is a very amateur [[photographer]], an avid [[stamp collector]] and a [[boating]] enthusiast. Ackerman is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].

At the 2006 meeting of the [[International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians (ICJP)]], Ackerman was unanimously elected to serve as the executive of the organization.

Congressman Ackerman was named an Honorary Graduate of the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] for his continued support of the service academy located in [[Kings Point, New York]].

== Committees ==
Congressman Ackerman is a senior member of the [[House International Relations Committee]] where he plays major leadership roles in flash point areas of the world. Often, these involve [[national security]], [[nuclear proliferation]] and [[terrorism]] issues in areas such as the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]].

Ackerman is the chairman of the International Relations Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, which has oversight on U.S. policy towards nations in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. He is also a member of and the most recent Democrat to chair the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, which has jurisdiction over [[United States]] policy towards [[countries]] in [[Asia]].

Ackerman also serves on the powerful Financial Services Committee where he sits on two Subcommittees: Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, as well as Capital Markets, Insurance and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Financial Services Committee has jurisdiction over [[banking]] and [[financial institutions]], housing programs, insurance regulations and monetary policy <U+2014> issues that are critical to [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]]. Ackerman is a champion of consumer rights and a fighter for financial community reform.

A Representative<U+2019>s representative, he was also Congress<U+2019> delegate to the United Nations. In addition, he is the Present Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on [[India]] and [[Indian American]]s. In 2002, he was awarded [[India]]'s third highest civilian award, the [[Padma Bhushan]] for his contributions as member of the India Caucus in the Congress.

== Legislative highlights ==
[[Image:911stamp.jpg|left|thumb|The "Heroes" postage stamp, introduced by Congressman Ackerman. Revenue from sales of this stamp supported families of rescue workers killed or disabled while responding to the attacks of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]]. The stamp was based on a photograph entitled [[Ground Zero Spirit]].]]

Among Ackerman's significant legislative undertakings, was the passage of his Baby [[AIDS]] [[legislation]]. The measure requires mandatory [[HIV]] testing of newborns and disclosure of the results to the mother. It also forbids insurance companies from terminating the [[health insurance]] of anybody who undergoes an [[AIDS test]], regardless of the results.

Ackerman championed the issue of newborn testing after discovering that 45 states, including New York, tested babies for HIV but did not disclose the results to the mothers, using the data for mere statistical purposes. As a result, thousands of mothers brought their infants home from the hospital, never aware that their children had tested positive for HIV. This [[legislation]], which became the subject of profound debate nationwide, garnered such support that it was the only bill that session of Congress to have a majority of all the House [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] as cosponsors. In addition, Ackerman stopped the anonymous testing from being reinstated in years that followed.

The Congressman was also successful in getting enacted, his bill that created the "Heroes" [[postage stamp]] (the one with the three firefighters raising the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] at ground zero), the revenue from which helps the families of rescue workers killed or permanently disabled while responding to the September 11 attacks.

Ackerman also scored a victory in his efforts to ban downed animals from being sold as meat in [[supermarket]]s, [[restaurant]]s and butcher stores. For a decade, Ackerman warned that use of such livestock was not only inhumane treatment of animals but also risked causing a [[Mad Cow disease|Mad Cow]] disaster in the United States. His legislation fell on deaf ears until December 2003, when his warning became prophetic and the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] <U+2014> among those who had opposed the bill <U+2014> finally imposed his ban through regulation.

Also law of the land is Congressman Ackerman<U+2019>s measure requiring [[bank]]s and [[financial]] companies to notify consumers when negative information is placed on their [[credit report]]s. The Congressman also sponsored legislation which is now law that in the wake of the [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]] and other corporate scandals, prohibits accounting firms from consulting for the companies they audit.

Other highlights include the Congressman authoring legislation that required President George W. Bush to impose [[international sanctions|sanctions]] against the [[Palestinian Authority]] for not complying with peace agreements it signed with the U.S. and [[Israel]]. Ackerman was also successful in getting [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] to cover testing for [[prostate cancer]].

Enacted as well was his measure that prevents [[war criminals]] and [[human rights]] abusers who have perpetrated [[genocide]], [[torture]], [[terrorism]] or other atrocities, from entering the U.S. and deports those who have slipped in. In addition, Ackerman sponsored the first federal legislation to ban the use of handheld [[cell phones]] while driving.

On October 10, 2002, Gary Ackerman was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

== Congressional initiatives ==

In his capacity as the then Chairman of the Asia Subcommittee, Ackerman made history in the 1990s by traveling to [[North Korea]] to discuss [[non-proliferation]]. Upon his return to [[South Korea]], Ackerman became the first person since the [[Korean War]] to cross the [[DMZ]] (Demilitarized Zone). 

Ackerman is also well known for his many missions to feed the starving people of [[Ethiopia]] and the [[Sudan]] and for playing a leading role in the rescue of [[Ethiopian Jews]] and aiding their emigration to [[Israel]]. Active in the Middle East peace process, Ackerman has met with the current and most past Israeli prime ministers and the heads of all the [[Arab]] countries in an effort to help secure peace in the region. He also ventured to [[Kashmir]] enduring sub-freezing winter temperatures in an attempt to secure the release of four western hostages. 

Among his many other initiatives, Ackerman helped to force the State of [[Hawaii]] to change its law that forbade blind individuals from bringing their guide dogs with them to the islands. The Congressman chaired an investigation and bipartisan hearing into whether [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]] officials properly utilized the spraying of [[Malathion]] during the [[West Nile virus]] outbreak. He also obtained federal funds to combat a return of the virus. 

He convinced the [[Germany|German]] government to establish a $110 million fund to compensate 18,000 [[Holocaust]] survivors and to investigate whether 3300 former [[Nazism|Nazi]] soldiers now living in the U.S. and collecting German pensions are war criminals. 

Congressman Ackerman also convinced the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to stop garnishing wages from certain U.S. soldiers serving in the war against [[Iraq]]. Although troops who serve in combat zones are not required to pay federal [[tax]]es, many soldiers had failed to be granted the exemption. 

In addition, the Congressman lobbied federal security officials <U+2014> with the September 11, 2001 attacks in mind <U+2014> to use retired law enforcement officers as screeners at New York airports and he pressed President Bush to make good on his promise to provide New York with $20 billion in additional 9/11 disaster aid.

The Congressman has also not been without some controversial votes. He was one of only 22 Congressman and the only Democrat from New York to vote against a resolution calling for the protection of the symbols and traditions of [[Christmas]]. The resolution, which did not include language that would protect the symbols of other religious holidays, passed 401-22 in the House in December 2005. This isn<U+2019>t the first time the Congressman was labeled as anti-Christian; in April 2003 the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] for religious and civil rights attacked Ackerman for voting against a non-binding resolution that would have declared a day of prayer in recognition of the U.S. [[war in Iraq]]. He was also criticized for calling on Bush to demand U.S. Secretary [[Rod Paige]]'s resignation for stating that values taught in Christian schools are better than those learned in public schools.

Ackerman received an "A" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005 [http://www.drummajorinstitute.com/congress/drum-major-voting-summary.php?name=Ackerman&state=NY&database=house Congressional Scorecard] on middle-class issues.

Ackerman referred to [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m]] as an 'great Iraqi poet' in his Iraq resolution speech at February 2007, while in fact Omar Khayyam is an ethnic Persian who was born in modern day [[Iran]].
