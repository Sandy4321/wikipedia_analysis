'''Charterhouse''', also known as '''Charterhouse-on-Mendip''', at {{gbmapping|ST500557}}, is a small [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[Mendip Hills]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) in the [[England|English]] county of [[Somerset]].

==Name==
The name is believed to come from the [[Carthusian]] order of [[Grande Chartreuse|Chartreuse]] in [[France]], which was established in [[Witham Friary|Witham]] (near [[Frome]]) in [[1181]] and formed a cell at Charterhouse in [[1283]] with a grant to mine lead ore.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1874336032}}</ref><ref name="reid">{{cite book |last=Reid |first= Robert Douglas |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Some buildings of Mendip |year=1979 |publisher=The Mendip Society |location= |isbn=0905459164 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/publications/up_081015_autumn07_lo.pdf |title=Autumn newsletter 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |format=PDF |work=Mendip Hills AONB }}</ref>

==History==
{{seealso|Charterhouse Roman Town}}
There is evidence, in the form of burials in local caves, of human occupation since the late [[Neolithic]]/Early [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Mendip Hills An Archaeological Survey of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty | work=Somerset County Council Archaeological Projects | url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/media/896B4/MendipAONB.pdf | accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>

The [[lead]] and [[silver]] [[Mining|mines]] at Charterhouse, were first operated on a large scale by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], from at least AD [[49]]. At first the lead/silver industries were tightly controlled by the [[Roman legion|Roman military]], but within a short time the extraction of these metals was contracted out to civilian companies, probably because the silver content of the local [[ore]] was not particularly high.<ref>{{cite web | title=Major Romano-British Settlement Charterhouse on Mendip, Avon | work=Roman Britain.org | url=http://www.roman-britain.org/places/charterhouse.htm | accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> There was also some kind of [[castra|'fortlet']] there in the [[1st century]], and an [[amphitheatre]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Charterhouse | work=Big Roman Dig | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/bigromandig/database/2_31.jsp?activityId=361 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> The roman landscape has been  designated as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Firth |first=Hannah |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mendip from the air |year=2007 |publisher=Somerset County Council |location=Taunton |isbn=9780861833900 }}</ref>

After the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], it was granted to Robert May who constructed a substantial house here and one of his descendants John May became [[High Sheriff of Somerset]] in 1602.<ref name="reid"/>

There is further evidence of mine workings in the [[medieval]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] periods.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mendip Hills An Archaeological Survey of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty | work=Somerset County Council Archaeological Projects | url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/media/896B4/MendipAONB.pdf | accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gough |first=J.W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The mines of Mendip |year=1967 |publisher=David & Charles |location=Newton Abbot | id=http://www.amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/B0000CNKWB }}</ref>Some of which survives within the [[Blackmoor Nature Reserve]] owned by [[Somerset County Council]].
