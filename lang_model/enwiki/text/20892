'''''DJ Hero''''' is a [[music video game]] developed by [[FreeStyleGames]] and published by [[Activision]] as a [[rhythm game]] similar to ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on [[turntablism]], the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously-recorded songs using [[record player]]s and sound effect generators, and features 94 [[remix|remixes]] of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres. To score points, the player must press buttons to activate accented beats, adjust their crossfade between the two songs, and "scratch" the turntable on the game's custom controller in time to marks that scroll on the screen to score points and perform well for the virtual crowd. The game features both a single player Career mode and cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also features a mode for selected songs for a DJ player to play alongside another player using a ''Guitar Hero'' guitar controller. Many DJ and mix artists have contributed to the game both in the game's development, the creation of mixes, and in lending their images for playable avatars in the game; these including [[DJ Shadow]], [[Z-Trip]], [[DJ AM]], [[Cut Chemist]], [[J.Period]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Daft Punk]], and [[Eminem]].

''DJ Hero'' was generally well-received by game journalists, praising the departure from the ''Guitar Hero'' series-style of gameplay, the use of the turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strong as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, ''DJ Hero'' is stated by [[NPD Group]] to be the highest-grossing new [[intellectual property]] of 2009 in North America.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Djhero1.jpg|thumb|left|''DJ Hero'' presents the player with three tracks corresponding to the buttons on the turntable controller, along with features to insert beats or to adjust the crossfader. The game features avatars of several popular mix artists, including [[Daft Punk]], shown here.|alt=A video game screen. At the bottom, a curved arc shows three colored lines (green, red, and blue) that have round gems on them as well as move back and forth along the arc. A meter shows a scoring value and number of stars. Above and behind this, two human characters are using shown using a turntable mixer; the two characters are wearing black, futuristic objects and wear helmets to mask their identity.]]
''DJ Hero'' primarily simulates [[turntablism]], a musical style used by [[disc jockey]]s to create a new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously-recorded songs played on [[record player]]s along with sound effect generators. The game features [[score attack]] gameplay similar to the ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable [[Phonograph|turntable]] that supports 3 "stream" buttons, an effects dial, a [[crossfader]], and a "Euphoria" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game.<ref name="DJ_Hero_this_year">{{cite web|url=http://xbox.hdtvinfo.eu/component/content/article/21-dj-hero-coming-this-year.html|title=DJ Hero coming this year|date=March 24, 2009|publisher=Xbox - HDTV Info Europe|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref><ref name="gi preview">{{cite news | title = DJ Hero: Drop the Needle | publisher = ''[[Game Informer]]'' | pages = 46<U+2013>51 | date = June 2009 }}</ref> A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players.<ref name="gi e3">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200906/N09.0602.1027.10806.htm | title =Activision Round-up: Guitar Hero 5, DJ Hero, Blur And More | first = Meagan | last = VanBurkleo | date = 2009-06-02 | accessdate = 2009-06-02 | publisher = ''[[Game Informer]]''}}</ref> Notes travel in an arc across a spinning [[Gramophone record|record]] on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial.<ref name="gi preview"/> The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time.<ref name="gi preview"/> Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums.<ref name="gi preview"/> "Euphoria" is equivalent to ''Guitar Hero'''s Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier.<ref name="gi preview"/> There is also a "Rewind" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance.<ref name="gi preview"/><ref name="gi e3"/> The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out.

Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with ''Guitar Hero'' and other compatible guitar controllers in a "DJ vs Guitar" mode.<ref name="gi preview"/><ref name="gi e3"/> Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix.<ref name="gi preview"/> A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time.<ref name="gi preview"/>

Activision had initially applied for a [[trademark]] on the name ''DJ Hero'' in early 2008, leading to speculation that Activision was making plans to compete against [[Konami]]'s ''[[Beatmania]]'' series of music video games with their own DJ game as a possible spinoff of their popular ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series.<ref name="djhero-trademark">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/357408/activision-trademarks-dj-hero|title=Activision Trademarks DJ Hero|last=De Marco|first=Flynn |date=February 17th, 2008|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref> [[FreeStyleGames]], a small developer of music games, was employed to help produce localized downloadable content for ''Guitar Hero'' games and develop another yet-to-be announced music game.<ref name="fsg-purchase">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54707 | title = Activision Buys Music Game Dev.

FreeStyleGames' in-house team included 16 employees developing the remixes, headed by Dan Neil to ensure the overall quality of the soundtrack.<ref name="develop mixes">{{Cite web | url = http://www.develop-online.net/features/740/Heard-About-DJ-Hero | title = Heard About: DJ Hero | work = [[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] | date = 2010-01-11 | accessdate = 2001-01-12 | first = John | last = Broomhall }}</ref> The team used a combination of [[MIDI]] software along with the [[music sequencer]] program, [[Ableton Live]]; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software.<ref name="develop mixes"/> Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a mix to meet certain gameplay goals, taking only a few minutes to complete, compared with the development of songs for ''Guitar Hero''.<ref name="develop mixes"/>

The team worked alongside artists and DJ's for incorporation of songs into the game.<ref name="develop mixes"/> Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes of the game and hardware to show them what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups.<ref name="develop mixes"/> This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process.<ref name="develop mixes"/> Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals of the game and requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.<ref name="develop mixes"/>

[[DJ Shadow]] was brought in by Activision during November and December 2008, at least a year into the development into the game, to help select individual songs, help with creating the mixes, and provide additional input for the game, and will also be a playable DJ avatar in the game.<ref name="gi dj shadow interview"/><ref name="ign pre-e3">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/988/988126p1.html | title = Pre-E3 2009: DJ Hero Impressions | publisher = [[IGN]] | first = Daemon | last = Hatfield | date = 2009-05-29 | accessdate = 2009-05-29}}</ref> He was able to identify old effects samples that were used in the past for scratching for the developers to include the game.<ref name="gi dj shadow interview"/> To create the mixes, DJ Shadow first created a "dry version" of each mix which did not include any embellishments.

===Legal conflicts===
On April 15, 2009, the publishers of ''[[Scratch: The Ultimate DJ]]'', [[Genius Products]] and Numark, sued against ''Scratch'''s developer, [[7 Studios]] and Activision.

''DJ Hero'' has received positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart of the music genre given the large number of titles based on guitar play.<ref name="eurogamer review"/><ref name="ign review"/> The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed to meet the needs of the game.<ref name="ign review"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://gear.ign.com/articles/103/1039104p1.html | title = DJ Hero Turntable Controller Review | first = Scott | last = Lowe | date =2009-10-26 | accessdate = 2010-01-23 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref> The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended.<ref name="gamespot review"/><ref name="1up review"/> Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers.<ref name="gamespot review"/><ref name="eurogamer review"/><ref name="giantbomb review"/> Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied.<ref name="giantbomb review"/><ref name="1up review"/> The [[learning curve]] of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from "Medium" to "Hard" and "Expert" levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions.<ref name="gi review"/><ref name="ign review"/> Johnny Minkley of [[Eurogamer]] considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the "Easy" difficulty being "less thrilling and engaging" compared to ''Guitar Hero'', the game was "structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit" with each successive career set and difficulty mode.<ref name="eurogamer review"/> Cam Shae of [[IGN]] Australia felt that the changes in "Hard" mode over "Medium" were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in "Hard" and "Expert" modes.<ref name="ign au review"/>   Richard Li of [[1UP.com]] noted that the inability to fail a song is both "is both a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game.<ref name="1up review"/> The omission of a practice mode was noted by Dameon Hatfield of [[IGN]], believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities.<ref name="ign review"/> Reviewers believed that the small faults in ''DJ Hero'' can be easily fixed for potential sequels.<ref name="arstech review">{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2009/10/wicka-wicka-wicked-dj-hero-new-fresh-triumphant.ars | title = Wicka-wicka-wicked: DJ Hero new, fresh, triumphant | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = 2009-10-28 | accessdate = 2009-10-29 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>

Reviewers found the on-disc soundtrack to be generally strong; Hatfield believed that "the entire soundtrack is superb and could easily stand on its own outside the game".<ref name="ign review"/> Matt Helgeson of ''[[Game Informer]]'' considered it to be one of the "most adventurous" soundtracks of any music game, and said though it often relied too much on pop hits, it remained true to the spirit of the DJ mix scene.<ref name="gi review"/> Minkley thought the game to have "vital, varied, surprising and vast musical content" and to be a fresh experience compared to previous music games.<ref name="eurogamer review"/> Other reviewers felt the soundtrack had some weak areas. Shae noted that many of the mixes felt like "random mash-ups that take disparate songs", which would be appropriate for a live DJ, but does not reflect well on the art of mixing that can be performed today.<ref name="ign au review"/> Li noted a clear distinction in the quality of the mixes between the early sets&mdash;those mostly created in-house by FreeStyleGames&mdash;and the latter sets centered around the work of famous DJs.<ref name="1up review"/> While Ben Kuchera of [[Ars Technica]] felt the soundtrack was good, he asserted that individual songs were unrecognizable because of modifications made to them for the mixes, and that they were more difficult to adjust to within the gameplay itself.<ref name="ars flopped">{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/11/innovating-problems-why-dj-hero-flopped.ars | title = Innovating problems: why DJ Hero flopped | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = 2009-11-15 | accessdate = 2009-11-24 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>  

Many reviews for ''DJ Hero'' felt the addition of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and would made the mixes sound worse.<ref name="giantbomb review"/><ref name="ign review"/><ref name="eurogamer review"/> Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song.<ref name="ign review"/> This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller.<ref name="eurogamer review"/> While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun,<ref name="ign review"/> others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game.<ref name="gi review"/> The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible [[epilepsy|epilepic seizures]] that could occur while watching the game.<ref name="giantbomb review"/> The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same [[The Muppets|Muppet]]-like appearances that occur in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, and are overly stereotyped.<ref name="gi review"/>

===Sales===
Prior to ''DJ Hero''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> release, game industry analysts had projected the title would sell 1.6 million units in its first fiscal quarter; however, after disappointing sales performances of ''Guitar Hero 5'' and ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]'' in the month prior to ''DJ Hero'''s release, analysis had lowered that expectation to 600,000 units.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/dj-hero-demand-well-below-expectations | title = DJ Hero demand "well below" expectations | publisher = Game Industry | date = 2009-10-26 | accessdate = 2009-10-26 | first = Matt | last = Martin }}</ref> [[NPD Group]] figures for the month of October reported only 123,000 units of the game were sold in the United States,<ref name="initial sales-Gamespot">{{cite web | url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/6239988.html | title=Brutal Legend sells 216K, DJ Hero 123K | date =2009-11-13 | accessdate =2009-11-13 | first =Tor | last = Thorsen| publisher = [[Gamespot]] }}</ref> below the 175,000 units projected by analysts.<ref name="projected sales-Gamespot">{{cite web | url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/6239698.html | title=DJ Hero sells 175,000 in Oct. - Analyst | date =2009-11-12 | accessdate =2009-11-13 | first =Brendan | last = Sinclair| publisher = [[Gamespot]] }}</ref> November sales in North America were estimated at 211,000 units.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.industrygamers.com/news/dj-hero-sold-just-123k-units/ | title = DJ Hero Sold Just 211K Units in November | first = James | last = Brightman | date = 2009-12-11 | accessdate = 2009-12-18 | publisher = Industry Gamers }}</ref> Through January 2010, the game has sold 789,000 units in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/02/activisions-guitar-hero-chief-exits-after-less-than-a-year.html | title = Activision's Guitar Hero chief exits after less than a year | first= Ben | last = Fritz | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2010-02-02 | accessdate = 2010-02-02 }}</ref> [[Ars Technica]], in considering the game as a "flop" in its present market due to these numbers, attributes the failure being due to four factors: the game was not suited for social play, the cost was prohibitive in the current market, the mixes in the game were relatively unknown despite the individual songs being well-known, and there was a lack of familiarity with how a turntable works for mixing compared with a guitar or drum kit.<ref name="ars flopped"/> However, despite these figures, Activision claims that ''DJ Hero'' is the highest-grossing new [[intellectual property]] of 2009 in North America based on NPD data, which reporters attribute to the game's higher cost.<Ref>{{cite web | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/01/press-start-top-selling-games-in-us-dj-hero-revenue/1 | title = Press Start: Top selling games in U.S.; 'DJ Hero' revenue | work = [[USA Today]] | date =2010-01-20 | accessdate =2010-01-19 | first =Brett | last = Molina }}</ref>
