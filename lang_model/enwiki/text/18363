Through his career had faced most of Mexico's top stars of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s including lucha libre legends such as [[El Santo]], [[El Solitario]], [[Mil M<U+00E1>scaras]], [[Alejandro Cruz (wrestler)|Black Shadow]], [[Hurac<U+00E1>n Ram<U+00ED>rez]], [[Gory Guerrero]], [[Ray Mendoza]] and [[Perro Aguayo]]. He was known as the "king of the Welterweight" due to him holding the [[Mexican National Welterweight Championship]] four times and the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship]] three times in his career. Lagarde teamed up with [[Ren<U+00E9> Guajardo]] to form a [[tag team]] known as ''Los Rebeldes'', considered to be one of the top five tag teams in Lucha libre history.

==Professional wrestling career==
Born in [[Zapotl<U+00E1>n de Ju<U+00E1>rez]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], Carlos Lagarde debuted in 1950 in Hidalgo State wrestling under the name Karloff Lagarde. In 1957 he won his first wrestling championship when he defeated Jalisco Gonzalez to win the [[Mexican National Welterweight Championship]].<ref name=MexWelter/> The following year, on January 31, 1958 Lagarde also won the [[NWA World Welterweight Championship]] when he defeated [[Blue Demon]] for the championship. With both the Mexican National and the NWA World titles in the welterweight division Largade reigned as the king of the welterweights for several years. On March 24, 1961 Lagarde became a triple champion when he defeated [[El Santo]] to win the [[Mexican National Middleweight Championship]]. His run with the Mexican National Welterweight Championship lasted 1,859 days in total, from 1957 until April 4, 1962 when he lost the title to Blue Demon. In the early 1960s Lagarde had begun teaming up with [[Ren<U+00E9> Guajardo]] and by 1962 they were one of the top teams in Mexico at the time and one of the top five ''Lucha libre'' teams of all time.<ref name=FigurasLagarde/><ref name="FigurasGuajardo">{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Grandes Figuras de la Lucha Libre | work = Ren<U+00E9> Guajardo (1933 - 1992)| location = Portales, Mexico | id = 17 | page = 49 | date = November, 2008 | accessdate = March 30, 2010 | language = Spanish}}</ref> They were collectively known as ''Los Rebeldes'' ("The Rebels") and headlined shows all over Mexico while wrestling against some of the top ''[[Face (professional wrestling)|Tecnicos]]'' (good guys) at the time such as El Santo, Blue Demon and [[Rayo de Jalisco, Sr.|Rayo de Jalisco]]. They held the [[Mexican National Tag Team Championship]] at least once between 1962 and 1967.<ref name=MexTag/> On April 28, 1962 Lagarde regained the Mexican National Welterweight Championship from Blue Demon, but vacated the title the following year to focus on defending the NWA World Welterweight Championship and teaming with Guajardo.<ref name=MexWelter/> Lagarde's marathon reign as NWA World Welterweight Champion ended on August 5, 1965, 2743 days after winning it, when he lost to [[Hurac<U+00E1>n Ram<U+00ED>rez]].<ref name=NWAWelter/> Lagarde regained the title in September and held it for 590 days before Vento Castella defeated him for the belt. Lagarde's third and final reign as NWA World Welterweight champion began only two months after Castella had won the title and lasted for 1,469 days making Lagarde the person to have held the NWA World Welterweight Championship the longest with 4,802 days in total, over 2,000 days more than the second longest.<ref name=NWAWelter/> In 1969 Lagarde won the Mexican National Welterweight Championship for a fourth time, defeating longtime rival Hurac<U+00E1>n Ram<U+00ED>rez for the title on September 9, 1969. The rivalry with Ram<U+00ED>rez extended into the 1970s with Ram<U+00ED>rez regaining the title in 1972 and Lagarde winning his fourth and final title from Ram<U+00ED>rez on October 20, 1972.<ref name=MexWelter/> Lagarde's final title run ended on August 11, 1973 when he was defeated by El Marque.<ref name=MexWelter/>

==Movie career==
When the Lagarde / Guajardo duo was at the top of the Mexican wrestling world the duo appeared in one of the many [[Lucha films]] produced at the time. They portrayed the ''[[wrestling mask|enmascarado]]'' (masked wrestlers) ''<U+00C1>ngel'' and ''Sat<U+00E1>n''. two of the main protagonists in the 1964 movie ''Los endemoniados del ring'' ("The Demons of the Ring").<ref name=FigurasLagarde/>

==Personal life==
Lagarde was a second generation wrestler, although the ring name of his father has not been found documented.<ref name=FigurasLagarde/> His brother wrestled around the same time as Lagarde was active, although the family relationship was not publicly known at the time, his brother wrestled as the masked "<U+00C1>ngel Negro" ("Black Angel"). Lagarde's nephew is also a professional wrestler as well, working under the [[ring name]] [[Karloff Lagarde, Jr.]] as a tribute to his uncle. It is not an uncommon practice in Mexico to become a "Junior" without being actually the son of the wrestler, instead it's seen as a tribute.<ref name=MondoFamily>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = A family affair | pages = 128<U+2013>132 | accessdate= July 16, 2009 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> Another one of Lagarde's nephews wrestles as ''Coco Rojo'', a wrestling [[clown]].<ref name=FigurasLagarde/>
