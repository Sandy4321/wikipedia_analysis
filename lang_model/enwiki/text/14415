'''Marcus Vick''' (born March 20, 1984 in [[Newport News, Virginia]])<ref name="hsprofile"/> is a former college and professional football player.  He is the younger brother of [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]], who also began playing [[high school football]] in [[Newport News Public Schools]].

==Early years==
Marcus Deon Vick was born to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie on March 20, 1984, in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. His parents married about a year later, by which time they had four children, Christina (Marcus's older sister), [[Michael Vick|Michael]] (Marcus's older brother), and Courtney (Marcus's younger sister). After their parents wed, the children elected to continue to use their mother's name as their surname.

The children grew up living in Ridley Circle, a [[public housing project]] in the financially depressed and crime-ridden [[East End (Newport News, Virginia)|East End]] neighborhood of [[Newport News]] not far from the massive [[Northrop Grumman Newport News]] Shipyard and local [[coal pier]]s. During his younger years, his father, Michael Boddie, had a job which required a lot of travel.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Their mother, Brenda, worked relatively [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|low wage service jobs]] that included driving a [[school bus]] as well as a position at a local [[K-Mart]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Like his older brother Michael, Marcus Vick attended [[Warwick High School (Newport News)|Warwick High School]]. At Warwick High School, he was coached by high school football coach [[Tommy Reamon]], a former collegiate and professional football player himself who had been instrumental in the development of future NFL quarterbacks [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]] (his older Cousin) and Marcus' brother, Michael.

==College career==
===Recruitment to Virginia Tech===
Heading into his senior year of high school, Marcus Vick was one of the country's top quarterback prospects.<ref>[http://rivals100.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?Sport=1&pr_key=1720 Marcus Vick <U+2013> Football Recruiting]. Rivals100.rivals.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-20.</ref> Although his brother had taken [[Virginia Tech]] in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]] within one game of a national championship and despite Michael's close relationship with Virginia Tech coach [[Frank Beamer]], Marcus did not seem sold on attending Tech.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The Universities of NC State, Virginia, Tennessee, and Miami all had scholarship offers on the table{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and after taking a trip with Reamon to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] training camp, even Michael was not convinced that Tech was the best option for his brother. Marcus was seriously considering NC State and Virginia Tech. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} By September, it was clear that Marcus was considering several schools, mostly because of concerns about the Hokies' scheme and its ability to prepare him for the [[NFL]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===2002<U+2013>2003===
While Vick arrived at Tech with great fanfare,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} he did not play as a true freshman. Beamer [[redshirted]] him, and he was a member of the dress squad for every game. During his freshman year, he ran a 4.48 forty and posted a 36-inch vertical jump during spring max testing. Vick threw five touchdown (TD) passes during spring scrimmages and added another in the Maroon-White game. He was 6-for-7 passing for 95 yards and one TD during one scrimmage, and turned in a 57-yard run in another scrimmage. He hit 10-of-15 passes for 92 yards and a TD in the Maroon-White game. For performances such as these, he was awarded the Paul Torgersen Award for the top offensive newcomer.

In 2003, Vick played in eleven games, splitting time with [[Bryan Randall]]. The highlight of Vick's season came during a 31<U+2013>7 upset win over #2 Miami. Despite completing only one pass, Vick's exceptional running ability and the outstanding play of Tech's defense contributed to one of the biggest wins in Tech's history. In Virginia Tech's loss in the [[Insight Bowl]] to the [[California Golden Bears]], Vick racked up 82 receiving yards, including one touchdown reception.<ref name="hsprofile">{{cite web|url = http://www.hokiesports.com/football/players/2005/vick.html|title = Marcus Vick's profile|accessdate = 2006-07-01}}</ref>

===2004===
Prior to the 2004 collegiate season, Vick had several run-ins with the law which resulted in [[misdemeanor]] convictions. According to an article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the convictions triggered a review by Virginia Tech Athletic Director Jim Weaver under the school's Comprehensive Action Plan, which was put in place in 1997 after 22 arrests involving 19 football players during a 15-month period.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27958-2004May14.html | work=The Washington Post | title=3 Va. Tech Football Players Get Jail Time | date=May 15, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>    

Following an incident which occurred on January 27, 2004, he was arrested and accused of having sexual relations with a 15-year old girl. The [[age of consent]] in Virginia is 16. With the others, he was also charged with unlawfully providing alcohol to three underage girls who "claimed" to be college students.

An eight-hour long trial was held in [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery County]] Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. According to a report in the Washington Post, "one of the girls wept as she recounted how she and two friends met the players at a Tech women's basketball game Jan. 27 and, after sneaking out of a house during a slumber party, went in Vick's sport utility vehicle to the apartment Vick and Hill share." The newspaper also reported "another girl testified that she told the players she was 18, three years older than her actual age." <ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> Although Vick had confessed to police that he had consensual sex with one of the girls that night,<ref>[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/95954 Lawsuit: Vick kept seeing underage girl]. Roanoke.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-20.</ref> during the hearing, the girl refused to answer questions from defense lawyers, invoking her [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination.
    
Juvenile and Domestic Judge Robert C. Viar Jr. dismissed the sex charge against Vick. However, he was convicted of all three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $2,250. On the same day, two of Vick's teammates also were convicted of three counts each of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Hokies [[tailback]] Mike Imoh, 19, was sentenced to 10 days in jail and fined $750. [[Wide receiver]] Brenden Hill, 19, was sentenced to 20 days in jail and fined $1,500.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/19/penalty.box/index.html | work=CNN | title=Marcus Vick convicted of misdemeanors | date=May 19, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> 

Vick appealed the lower court decision to Montgomery County Circuit Court. However, on September 13, he entered into a [[plea agreement]] which was accepted by the circuit court. The terms were a "no contest" plea to a single [[misdemeanor]] count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a suspended 30-day jail sentence, a fine of $100, and he was ordered to perform 24 hours of community service. Montgomery County Circuit Judge Robert Turk also prohibited Vick from contacting the teenage girls who were at the party. (After planning to appeal, Hill also settled on a similar plea agreement that erased two of the three misdemeanor counts. He pleaded "no contest" to the same charge and received the same penalty as Vick).<ref name="usatoday.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/bigeast/2004-09-13-vatech-vick_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Virginia Tech's Vick pleads no contest | date=September 13, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> 

In the summer of 2004, Vick was charged with reckless driving and possession of [[marijuana]] in [[New Kent County, Virginia]]. As part of a plea agreement in that case, Vick was placed in a drug offender program that required him to perform 24 hours of community service, undergo drug counseling and random drug tests, and give up his Virginia driver's license for six months.<ref name="usatoday.com"/> 

As a result of the incidents, he was suspended from the university for the fall semester of 2004.<ref name="VickdismissedWP">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/06/AR2006010601017.html|title=Virginia Tech Sacks Vick|last=Schlabach|first=Mark|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2006-01-07|accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.courttv.com/people/penalty_box/080304_ctv.html Penalty Box]. Courttv.Com. Retrieved on 2011-09-20.</ref>

Vick was reinstated to the school and the football team under specific guidelines that warranted immediate dismissal from the team for further transgressions.

===2005===
Head coach [[Frank Beamer]] initially announced that Vick would enter the 2005 season as the team's third-string quarterback, but he quickly won the starting role after impressive spring practices and scrimmages. All in all, it was Vick's most successful season, which saw the Hokies contending for a national championship and culminating in an impressive 11<U+2013>2 record, an [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Coastal Division title, an appearance in the inaugural [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Championship Game in the 2005 season, and a win in the 2006 [[Gator Bowl]].

The 2005 season, however, saw more controversy surrounding Vick. On October 1, 2005, Vick angered fans and press in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]] with a display of his middle finger to the crowd during the game at [[West Virginia University]]. Vick later apologized and made no further comments.

During the 2006 [[Gator Bowl]] on January 2, 2006, Vick once again courted controversy when he stomped on the leg of [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]] defensive end [[Elvis Dumervil]] with his foot. Dumervil was in a defenseless position; he was trying to get back up after the play. Following the game, Vick claimed the incident was accidental and asserted he apologized to Dumervil after the game; Dumervil, however, said that no apology was ever made.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2285819 "Vick reportedly wanted to scare teens after taunts"] [[ESPN]].com</ref> Virginia Tech Athletic Director [[Jim Weaver (athletic director)|Jim Weaver]] issued a statement from the university on the incident:

{{cquote|The unsportsmanlike conduct of quarterback Marcus Vick in yesterday's Gator Bowl game against Louisville is unacceptable behavior and contrary to the Hokies Respect Campaign. Such on-field action is not reflective of Virginia Tech football nor of the values we hold at Virginia Tech. I and my colleagues in central administration are embarrassed and this athletic administration will not condone such acts of unsportsmanlike conduct. We will review and assess this incident further and deal with it accordingly.}}

The referee working the game later apologized for missing Vick's stomp, saying he would have thrown Vick out of the game if he had seen it.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/acc/2006-01-04-referee-vick_x.htm "Referee says he would have tossed Vick had he seen stomp"] [[Associated Press]] via [[USA Today]]</ref>

Vick had lost his privilege to drive a motor vehicle in Virginia as the result of multiple traffic convictions, including reckless driving. On December 17, 2005, he was charged in [[Hampton, Virginia]] with speeding, and for the second time, with the more serious misdemeanor charge of driving on a suspended or revoked license.<ref name="VickdismissedWP" /> These offenses brought the total of his traffic arrests to nine in Virginia during the time he was enrolled at Virginia Tech.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

===Dismissal from Virginia Tech===
In 24 career games at Virginia Tech, Vick threw for 2,868 yards, 19 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions while also running 184 times for 492 yards and six touchdowns. However, during the same period, he was charged with nine traffic offenses, as well as convictions for possession of marijuana and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls05/news/story?id=2282642 Vick, dismissed by Hokies, says he will turn pro <U+2013> College Football <U+2013> ESPN].

On January 6, 2006, Virginia Tech announced his permanent dismissal from its football program "due to a cumulative effect of legal infractions and unsportsmanlike play".<ref name="VickdismissedVT"/>

In response to being thrown off the team, Vick has been quoted as saying, "It's not a big deal. I'll just move on to the next level, baby."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls05/news/story?id=2282642|title=Vick, dismissed by Hokies, says he will turn pro|date=2006-01-07|accessdate=2007-08-25|publisher=Associated Press via ESPN}}</ref>

==Professional career==
Vick declared his eligibility for the [[NFL draft]] on January 7, 2006.
After the [[2006 NFL Draft]], he told ESPN's [[Michael Smith (sports reporter)|Michael Smith]] that he considered himself a better quarterback than [[Matt Leinart]] and [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft06/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=2427759|title=QB says he has matured since dismissal from Va.

===Miami Dolphins===
Despite pre-draft speculation that Vick could go as high as the third round, he went undrafted, becoming an unrestricted free agent who could sign a contract with any team. Many of the NFL's scouts questioned his attitude and his ability to avoid future troubles on and off the field. Vick attended a [[Miami Dolphins]] rookie free agent minicamp after the draft<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/dolphins/2006-05-15-vick-signed_x.htm|title= Dolphins sign Marcus Vick|date=2006-05-15|accessdate=2007-08-25|publisher=Associated Press via USA Today}}</ref> and was subsequently signed by the Dolphins to a free agent contract for league minimum pay as a "wide receiver/quarterback/return specialist".<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2446261 Marcus Vick agrees to deal with Dolphins <U+2013> NFL <U+2013> ESPN]. Sports.espn.go.com (2006-05-15). Retrieved on 2011-09-20.</ref>

The Dolphins released him on September 2, 2006 to reach the regular season roster limit but re-signed Vick two days later, assigning him to the practice squad. His number was 16. On October 17, 2006 the Dolphins signed him as a wide receiver/kick returner/quarterback. He was moved from the practice squad to the active roster for the team's Week 7 game versus the [[Green Bay Packers]]. He was listed as the No. 3 "emergency" quarterback on the depth chart. His first action in the NFL was a regular season game against the [[New York Jets]] on December 25, 2006. He played the wide receiver position for the 4th quarter but had no recorded receptions. After the season, his contract expired and the Dolphins opted not to re-sign him.

==Legal troubles after Virginia Tech==
Within three days of his expulsion from Virginia Tech, Marcus Vick became involved in another incident resulting in criminal charges, this time back home in [[Hampton Roads]]. The result in court was yet another misdemeanor conviction, but only suspended jail time. He also subsequently became the target of a [[civil lawsuit]] which had not been resolved as of June 8, 2007.

On December 14, 2006, a 17-year old girl from [[Montgomery County, Virginia]], filed a [[civil lawsuit]] against Marcus Vick accusing him of molestation of a minor, fraud, and additional charges. In the lawsuit, seeking $6.3 million,<ref name="Vick_Released"/> an unnamed girl claims that when she was 15 (below the legal [[age of consent]] in Virginia) and was a student in high school, she was forced into a sexual situation with Vick, who was 20 years old, over 
a nearly two year long period. She also alleges Vick offered to provide her alcohol and marijuana and forced her to have sex with other men.<ref name="VickLawsuit"/> On September 15, 2008, the [[New York Times|New York ''Times'']] reported according to the plaintiff's attorney, the parties had agreed in principle to a settlement in the lawsuit.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

On June 13, 2008, according to a report in the [[Virginian-Pilot|Norfolk ''Virginian-Pilot'']] newspaper, a bicycle officer in Norfolk approached a couple arguing in a car shortly after midnight. When asked for identification, the driver, Marcus Vick, allegedly took off, driving the car at high speed. When another officer spotted the car and stopped it, Vick failed a sobriety test. Marcus Vick was charged with DUI, misdemeanor eluding police, driving on the wrong side of a street, reckless driving and driving on a suspended license, and was taken into custody. The young woman who is from [[Miami, Florida]] was charged with public drunkenness.<ref>[http://hamptonroads.com/2008/06/marcus-vick-arrested-dui-norfolk Ex-NFL player Marcus Vick charged with DUI | HamptonRoads.com | PilotOnline.com].
