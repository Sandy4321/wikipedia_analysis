==Plot==
Upset that [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] left the group of friends to move to Stoolbend, Virginia, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], [[Glen Quagmire|Quagmire]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] decide to interview potential friends to fill the vacancy, and are approached by a fellow bar patron named Jerome. After impressing the group with his [[darts|dart skills]], they decide to let Jerome join as their new fourth member. Later, when Peter introduces Jerome to [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], she reveals that the two used to date. Peter grows jealous and, in a fit of drunken rage, throws a bottle through the window of Jerome's home, inadvertently causing a fire and burning down his house. The next morning, Peter discovers that Lois has invited Jerome to live with them, unaware of the fact that Peter was the vandal who burned down his house. As time goes on, Peter cannot contain his jealousy and eventually appears to dress as a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], though it is immediately revealed that Peter's intention is to dress as a ghost carrying a torch, kicking Jerome out. During an argument, Lois reveals that Jerome had bought Peter a gift, and he goes on to apologize to Jerome for being so insensitive.

Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] offers to be the fourth member of Peter's group, until Peter tells him that it would not work because Quagmire hates him. After attempting to rectify the situation outside Quagmire's house, Brian ends up making things worse by mistaking Quagmire's sister, who is hiding out from her [[domestic violence|abusive]] boyfriend, for one of his dates. Brian tricks Quagmire into going to dinner with him by making him think [[Cheryl Tiegs]], Quagmire's long-lost love, is the one inviting him. At dinner, Brian attempts to make small talk, but Quagmire doesn't soften up. Finally, Brian asks Quagmire why he hates him. Quagmire, in response, lets loose a tirade outlining everything Brian has done that Quagmire finds reprehensible, and angrily storming off afterwards, sarcastically saying "thanks for the fucking steak". Brian then returns home, having been crying on the way back. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], in an uncharacteristic act of kindness, cheers him up by saying that he only needs to like himself, and then professes his own admiration for Brian by letting him spend the night in his room. Once they begin to sleep, however, Brian passes gas, much to Stewie's dismay.<ref name="ignpreview">{{citeweb |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/104/1048319p1.html |title=Family Guy Preview: "Jerome Is the New Black" |publisher=IGN |date= 2009-11-20|accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref>

Reviews of the episode were mostly mixed to negative, calling it an "inconsistent mixed bag episode," with many jokes "{{interp|falling}} flat." In a simultaneous review of the episodes of ''The Simpsons'' and ''American Dad!'' that preceded and followed the episode respectively, as well as ''The Cleveland Show'', [[The A.V. Club|The A.V. Club's]] Todd VanDerWerff commented that he thought the episode "started out well before sort of just petering out as the episode went on," comparing it to ''[[South Park|South Park's]]'' attempt to replace [[Kenny McCormick]], before ultimately reintroducing the character into the series. In the conclusion of his review, VanDerWerff praised Quagmire's monologue, commenting "it's certainly amusing that the show is spending all of this time tearing down the one character who's a mouthpiece for the creator."<ref name="avclub">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/pranks-and-greensa-brown-thanksgivingjerome-is-the%2C35656/ |title="Pranks and Greens"/"A Brown Thanksgiving"/"Jerome Is the New Black"/"My Morning Straitjacket" |work=The A.V.
