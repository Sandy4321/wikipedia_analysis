'''Sir Lord Baltimore''' are a pioneering [[United States|American]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], formed in 1968 by [[lead vocals|lead vocalist]]/[[drum kit|drummer]] [[John Garner (musician)|John Garner]], [[electric guitar|guitarist]] [[Louis Dambra]], and [[bass guitar|bass player]] [[Gary Justin]]. They are most notable for the fact that a 1971 review of their debut record, ''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]]'', contained the first documented use of the term "heavy metal" to refer to a style of music.<ref>Saunders, ''Kingdom Come'' review, ''Creem''.</ref> Additionally, Sir Lord Baltimore featured a drumming lead singer, traditionally a rarity in rock and metal music.<ref>Sir Lord Baltimore biography, BNRMetal.com.</ref>

In 2006, Garner and Dambra reunited as Sir Lord Baltimore and released a new album, ''[[Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw]]''. However, the band now has an overt [[Christian rock]] focus not found in their earlier work.<ref>Freeman, "Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master", ''The Village Voice''.</ref> Justin, who is no longer an active musician, did not participate.<ref>Garner, SirLordBaltimore.com.</ref>

==History==
Sir Lord Baltimore's career is divided into two distinct periods: their original formation from 1968-1976, during which time they put out two studio albums and started a third; and [[lead vocals|lead vocalist]]/[[drum kit|drummer]] [[John Garner (musician)|John Garner]] and [[electric guitar|guitarist]] [[Louis Dambra]]'s reunion in 2006.

===Original career===
[[Image:SLB_kingdom_come.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]]'' (1970)]] 
Having first met in high school, Garner, Dambra, and [[Bass guitar|bassist]] [[Gary Justin]] started rehearsing together in 1968.<ref>Freeman, "Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master", ''The Village Voice''.<br>* Sir Lord Baltimore biography, Metal-Archives.com.</ref> At the time of their formation, Dambra (as Louis Caine) was also playing for a group called [[The Koala (band)|The Koala]], who released an [[The Koala (album)|eponymous]] [[LP album|LP]] in 1969.<ref>''The Koala'' biography, Bad Cat Records.</ref> Additionally, Justin has cited [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s [[Jack Bruce]] as an influence on his early career choice.<ref>Saunders, ''Kingdom Come'' review, ''Creem''.</ref>

After a relatively short time, the new band auditioned for [[Mike Appel]], who was then working as a talent scout and would later launch and manage the career of [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Appel agreed to mentor them, reportedly gave them the name Sir Lord Baltimore, and would later co-write and co-produce their debut album.<ref>Freeman, "Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master", ''The Village Voice''.<br>* Rivadavia, Sir Lord Baltimore biography, AnthologyRecordings.com.</ref> Before going into the studio, though, the group played their first live concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], but it wasn't a paid performance.<ref>Garner, SirLordBaltimore.com.</ref>

Their first studio release, ''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]]'', was recorded at Vantone Studios in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], [[New Jersey]], with Jim Cretecos serving as Appel's co-producer. More notably, it was mixed at [[New York City|New York]], [[New York]]'s [[Electric Lady Studios]] by legendary [[audio engineer|engineer]] [[Eddie Kramer]], better known for his work with [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], and many others. According to Appel, [[United Kingdom|British]] [[psychedelic rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]] had the opportunity to hear Sir Lord Baltimore during these sessions, and were reportedly impressed.<ref>Rivadavia, Sir Lord Baltimore biography, AnthologyRecordings.com.</ref>

[[Image:Sir_lord_baltimore.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sir Lord Baltimore (album)|Sir Lord Baltimore]]'' (1971)]] 
Released on [[Capitol Records]] in 1970, the resulting album featured very fast-paced [[rock 'n' roll]] with high levels of distortion in the guitar and, in some cases, the bass, and extensive multi-tracking to further enhance the guitar sound.<ref>Cope, ''Kingdom Come'' review, HeadHeritage.co.uk.</ref> Though this style of rock 'n' roll would become popular in later years, it was considerably different from the majority of that era's contemporary rock music.<ref>Rivadavia, Sir Lord Baltimore biography, AnthologyRecordings.com.</ref>

On February 19-20, 1971, Sir Lord Baltimore played consecutive nights at New York's [[Fillmore East]] as the opening act on a bill that included [[The J. Geils Band]] and [[Black Sabbath]], as part of the latter's ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' tour. (Sir Lord Baltimore played additional dates on this tour, as well.)<ref>"Paranoid Tour" tour dates, Black-Sabbath.com.</ref> A [[photograph|photo]] of the band used in the Fillmore East's programs was later used as the cover of their 2006 reunion album, ''[[Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw]]''.<ref>Garner, SirLordBaltimore.com.</ref>

In May 1971, [[Mike Saunders]] (of later [[Angry Samoans]] fame) wrote a favorable review of ''Kingdom Come'' for ''[[Creem|Creem magazine]]''. Of historical note was Saunders' assertation that "...Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] tricks in the book." To date, this appears to have been the first printed use of the term "heavy metal" to reference a musical genre.<ref>Saunders, ''Kingdom Come'' review, ''Creem''.</ref>

Issued the same year, and again on Mercury, ''[[Sir Lord Baltimore (album)|Sir Lord Baltimore]]'' marked a change in direction, with ''Kingdom Come'''s frenetic pace giving way to slower-tempoed songs more reminiscent of music produced by the band's hard rock peers. Sir Lord Baltimore expanded to a four-piece for this album, with Louis Dambra's brother, Joey Dambra, joining as a second guitarist.<ref>Cope, ''Kingdom Come'' review, HeadHeritage.co.uk.</ref> Furthermore, ''Sir Lord Baltimore'' contains the band's only officially released live recording, "Where Are We Going."<ref>Sir Lord Baltimore, ''Sir Lord Baltimore'', 1971 Mercury Records.</ref>

Their career started to fade after ''Sir Lord Baltimore'''s release, and Mercury dropped them shortly thereafter. Garner has publicly blamed [[recreational drugs|drugs]] on the band's initial downfall, and low record sales were also a factor.<ref>Rivadavia, Sir Lord Baltimore biography, AnthologyRecordings.com.<br>* Freeman, "Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master", ''The Village Voice''.</ref> However, the band did start work in the mid-1970s for an unreleased third album originally scheduled for 1976, and music written for that project was eventually used on ''Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw''.<ref>Garner, SirLordBaltimore.com.</ref> 

In 1994, ''Kingdom Come'' and ''Sir Lord Baltimore'' were reissued on a single [[compact disc]], ''Kingdom Come/Sir Lord Baltimore'', from [[PolyGram]], and again in 2003 via Red Fox. However, the track listing on the combined CD differs from the original recordings. ''Kingdom Come'' was issued again separately in 2007, this time on Anthology Recordings, and uses the same track listing as the 1994 and 2003 editions. It is unknown if the band received royalties from any of these re-releases.

===Reunion===
[[Image:Sir_Lord_Baltimore_III_Raw.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw]]'' (2006)]]
Some 30 years after the band's break-up, Garner and Dambra reunited to record and self-distribute a new Sir Lord Baltimore album, ''Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw'', on JG Records in July 2006. Garner produced the album. The majority of the album's bass guitar lines were performed by [[Tony Franklin (musician)|Tony Franklin]], with guitarist Anthony Guido and bass player Sam Powell being credited as guest musicians. Though the album's music was originally written for the aborted 1976 release, the lyrics were changed to present a Christian viewpoint not found on Sir Lord Baltimore's 1970s recordings.<ref>Freeman, "Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master", ''The Village Voice''.<br>* Rockwell, ''Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw'' review, AngelicWarlord.com.</ref>

As of February 2007, ''Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw'' has not been released in brick-and-mortar or online stores, though the band is seeking traditional distribution. In addition to his modern day work with Sir Lord Baltimore, Dambra is an active [[pastor]] who ministers to homeless families in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>Freeman, "Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master", ''The Village Voice''.</ref> To date, he and Garner have not announced any future projects.
