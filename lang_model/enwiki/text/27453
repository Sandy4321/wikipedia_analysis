'''Kristopher Royce Versteeg''' (born May 13, 1986) is a Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|winger]] currently playing for the [[Florida Panthers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). Originally selected 134th overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Boston Bruins]], he played with club's minor league affiliate, the [[Providence Bruins]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) for parts of two seasons before being traded to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Versteeg continued playing in the AHL with the Blackhawks' affiliates until making his NHL debut during the [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08 season]]. The following campaign, he received a nomination for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's best rookie. In his second full season with the Blackhawks, he helped the club win the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|2010]].

==Playing career==
Versteeg was drafted 134th overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Boston Bruins]].  After a four-year [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL) career (spanning from [[2002<U+2013>03 WHL season|2002<U+2013>03]] to [[2005<U+2013>06 WHL season|2005<U+2013>06]] and spent with the [[Lethbridge Hurricanes]], [[Kamloops Blazers]] and [[Red Deer Rebels]]) During his time with the Lethbridge Hurricanes, he played with future Chicago Blackhawks teammate [[Brent Seabrook]] for three seasons. Versteeg made his professional debut, playing in the final 13 games of the [[2005<U+2013>06 AHL season|2005<U+2013>06]] season with Boston's [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Providence Bruins]].  

He remained with Providence for the beginning of [[2006<U+2013>07 AHL season|2006<U+2013>07]] before being traded by Boston on February 3, 2007, along with a conditional draft pick, to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] for [[Brandon Bochenski]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/nhl/article_1255309.php/Blackhawks_ship_Bochenski_to_the_Bruins|title=Blackhawks ship Bochenski to the Bruins | publisher =m&c.com | date = 2007-02-03 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}</ref>  As a result, he moved within the AHL to Chicago's minor league affiliate, the [[Norfolk Admirals]].  Versteeg then played for the [[Rockford IceHogs]] in [[2007<U+2013>08 AHL season|2007<U+2013>08]], as Chicago switched its AHL affiliation.  He made his NHL debut that season as he was called up for a total of 13 games, recording 2 goals and 2 assists.

Versteeg played his first full season with the Blackhawks in [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09]].  On January 1, 2009, he scored the opening goal of the [[2009 Winter Classic]] held at [[Wrigley Field]] against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].  Finishing the season with 22 goals and 53 points, second in rookie scoring to [[Bobby Ryan]] of the [[Anaheim Ducks]], he was nominated for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year along with Ryan and goaltender [[Steve Mason (ice hockey)|Steve Mason]] of the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for his efforts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ryan, Versteeg, Mason selected as Calder Trophy nominees|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=276043|accessdate=2009-04-23|date=2009-04-22|publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]}}</ref> Mason ended up winning the Calder. 

Versteeg's entry-level contract expired after the 2008<U+2013>09 season, which would typically have made him a [[restricted free agent]] (RFA).  However, a clerical error in which the Blackhawks failed to tender qualifying offers to their pending RFAs by the league deadline led to speculation Versteeg and several of his teammates would become [[unrestricted free agents]]. As a result, the [[NHL Players' Association]] (NHLPA) filed a grievance on the players' behalf. Shortly thereafter, on July 8, 2009, he re-signed with the Blackhawks to a three-year contract, worth nearly [[USD|US]]$9 million.<ref>{{cite news | first=Len | last=Ziehm | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Blackhawks, Kris Versteeg have deal | date=2009-07-08 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url =http://www.suntimes.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/1656279,CST-SPT-hawk08.article | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-08 | language = }}</ref>

Versteeg's offensive production dropped in his second full NHL season, recording 20 goals and 44 points over 79 games. In the 2010 playoffs, he added 14 points in 22 games, helping the Blackhawks to a [[Stanley Cup]] championship, defeating the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the Finals. His name was originally misspelled "Kris Vertseeg" when engraved on the Stanley Cup, but was quickly corrected.<ref>{{cite news | title='Vertseeg' has name misspelled on Cup | date=2010-09-29 | publisher=[[Fox News]] | url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2010/09/29/vertseeg-misspelled-cup/ | accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>

Due to [[salary cap]] restraints, the Blackhawks were forced to trade away several players in the off-season, including Versteeg. On June 30, 2010, he was dealt to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] along with the rights to prospect [[Bill Sweatt]] in exchange for forwards [[Viktor Stalberg]], [[Chris DiDomenico]], and [[Philippe Paradis]].  He recorded his first [[Gordie Howe hat trick]] (a goal, an assist and a fight) with the Maple Leafs in a game against the [[Ottawa Senators]] on October 9, 2010.  He scored against goaltender [[Pascal Leclaire]], assisted on a goal by [[Phil Kessel]] and fought [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]]. After recording 35 points over 53 games with the Maple Leafs in [[2010<U+2013>11 NHL season|2010<U+2013>11]], he was traded for the third time in his career on February 14, 2011. Toronto sent him to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in exchange for first-round and third-round draft picks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Leafs send Versteeg to Flyers.|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=353885|accessdate=2011-02-14|date=2011-02-14|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref> Versteeg joined the team that he helped defeat in the previous season's Stanley Cup Finals and scored seven goals to go with four assists during the remainder of the regular season. He scored one goal during the [[2011 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], which came in the final game of Philadelphia's fourth game 5-1 loss to the [[Boston Bruins]] in the second round.

On July 1, 2011, the Flyers traded Versteeg to the Florida Panthers for a second-round pick (2012 or 2013-Florida's choice) and a third-round pick in 2012 entry draft.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=Philadelphia Flyers|date=2011-07-01|title=Flyers Trade Versteeg To Panthers|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=568197|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>  The trade came just a few hours after the Flyers announced the signing of [[Jarom<U+00ED>r J<U+00E1>gr|Jaromir Jagr]].

==Personal life==
Versteeg's younger brother [[Mitch Versteeg|Mitch]] is a [[defenceman]] for the [[Trenton Titans]] of the [[ECHL]].

Versteeg has developed a reputation within the NHL for his habit of singing in public, as evidenced by his recitation of a portion of [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]'s "[[Glamorous (song)|Glamorous]]" on Mouthpiece Sports, as well as performing an altered version of LMFAO's "Yes" during the Chicago Blackhawks' victory parade. Versteeg also sang Kanye West's verse of the song "American Boy" featuring Estelle in a video clip on Blackhawks TV during his time with the Hawks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzAVPwFsnrE|title=Kris Versteeg Raps Fergie in the Chicago Blackhawks Locker Room | publisher =[[YouTube]] | date = 2008-11-04 | accessdate = 2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGSU0OX4qYA|title=Kris Versteeg Raps At The Chicago Blackhawks Rally | publisher =[[YouTube]] | date = 2010-06-10 | accessdate = 2010-08-15}}</ref>

Versteeg has a tattoo on his upper right arm that reads [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|06 <U+2022> 09 <U+2022> 10]] in commemoration of the date he won the [[Stanley Cup]] as a member of the Blackhawks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/leafs-beat/versteeg-has-mark-of-a-champion/article1717697/|title=Versteeg has mark of a champion | publisher =The Globe and Mail | date = 2010-09-21 | accessdate = 2011-07-11}}</ref>
