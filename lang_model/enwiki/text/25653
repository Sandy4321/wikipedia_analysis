'''Metrolink''' is a [[commuter rail]] system in [[Southern California]], United States. Established in 1991 as the '''Southern California Regional Rail Authority''' ('''SCRRA'''), it began service the following year. 

The rail system operates lines in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].<ref name=RouteMap>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/documents/Stations/MetrolinkMap.pdf |title=Metrolink Routes |date=15 February 2010 |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> It connects with the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's]] [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] lines at [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], and with the San Diego [[San Diego Coaster|Coaster]] and [[Sprinter (San Diego)|Sprinter]] lines at [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]]. It also connects with [[Amtrak]]'s [[Pacific Surfliner]], [[Coast Starlight]], [[Southwest Chief]], and [[Sunset Limited]] trains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amtrakcalifornia.com/rail/go/amtrak/stations/l_p/los-angeles/index.cfm |title=Los Angeles |publisher=Amtrak California |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> As of December 2009, it served 55 stations on {{convert|388|mi}} of track (excluding shared miles) throughout Southern California.<ref name=MetrolinkFact2009 /> Average weekday ridership for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 38,400.

==Governance==
The SCRRA is a [[joint powers authority]] governed by five county-level agencies: the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]], the [[Riverside County Transportation Commission]], the [[San Bernardino Associated Governments]], and the [[Ventura County Transportation Commission]].<ref name=MetrolinkAbout/> [[Ex officio member|Ex officio]] members include the [[Southern California Association of Governments]], the [[San Diego Association of Governments]], and the state of [[California]].<ref name=MetrolinkFact2009/>

==History==
Beginning in 1990, the member agencies of the SCRRA acquired track and other property from several freight operators: 175 miles of track, maintenance yards, and stations were purchased from [[Southern Pacific]] for $450 million and the rights to use Los Angeles Union Station were purchased from [[Union Pacific]] for $17 million.<ref name=SoCalBusiness>{{cite news |title=LACTC to acquire Union Pacific property and trackage rights for planned five-county commuter rail system.

When Metrolink service began on October 26, 1992, it only operated on three lines: the Ventura, Santa Clarita, and San Bernardino Lines (the Santa Clarita Line later became the Antelope Valley Line).<ref name=FreeLibraryOpening>{{cite web |title=Metrolink Train Service Begins Monday, Oct. 26 |date=22 October 1992 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |publisher=The Free Library |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/METROLINK+TRAIN+SERVICE+BEGINS+MONDAY,+OCT.+26-a012686400}}</ref> In 1993 and 1994, service was expanded to include the Riverside and Orange County Lines, respectively. The Inland Empire-Orange County Line opened in 1995, becoming the first suburb to suburb commuter rail line in the country. The system realized its current form in 2002 with the addition of the 91 Line.<ref name=MetrolinkMilestones>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/about/?id=5 |title=Metrolink Milestones |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

Since July 2005, Metrolink has been operated under contract by [[Veolia Transport]]. After the expiration of the current contract in June, 2010, [[Amtrak]] will resume operation of Metrolink trains, as was the case from 1992 to July 2005.<ref name=MetrolinkMattersMarchApril2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/includes/metrolink_matters/MetrolinkMattersMarchAprilWEB.pdf |title=Metrolink Matters |date=March/April 2010 |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> In the fall of 2009, inward-facing video cameras were installed in locomotives in order to monitor engineers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Metrolink adds video cameras to locomotives |first=Phil |last=Willon |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=6 October 2009 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/06/local/me-metrolink-cameras6}}</ref> Crash energy management cars are being prepared for service in the fleet; they are designed to lessen the toll on passengers in the case of an accident<ref name=CamarilloAcorn>{{cite news |title=Metrolink receives passenger cars specially designed to absorb a crash  |first=Joann |last=Groff |newspaper=Camarillo Acorn |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url=http://www.thecamarilloacorn.com/news/2010-03-12/Community/Metrolink_receives_passenger_cars_specially_design.html}}</ref> As part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], over $200 million has been allotted to the SCRRA in order to implement [[positive train control]], a crash-avoidance system.<ref name=Recovery>{{cite web |url=http://www.recovery.org/projectdetails.aspx?pid=ANT:10922757&gloc=San%20Bernardino%20[CA]*CNT:06071 |title=Positive Train Control |date=18 August 2009 |publisher=Onvia, Inc. |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>

==Fares and service==
[[Image:Metrolink Train Station.jpg|thumb|left|Metrolink's [[Burbank (Metrolink station)|Burbank]] station]]
Metrolink's fare structure is based on a flat fee for boarding the train and an additional cost for distance; fares are calculated in 25-cent increments between stations. Prior to July 2004, Metrolink fares were based on price zones radiating outward from Union Station, but a restructuring converted fare calculation to the current system. Fare increases normally occur annually in July to coincide with increased fuel and labor expenses and have generally averaged between 3.5% and 5% per year (although the restructuring caused a larger jump in rates).<ref name=Fares2008>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/news/?id=2321 |title=Metrolink Board approves increase to systemwide and Group Travel Program fares |date=25 April 2008 |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> The [[oil price increases since 2003]] are partly to blame for consistently increasing fares as Metrolink trains are powered by [[diesel fuel]].<ref name=FuelCost>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/news/?id=403 |title=EZ transit pass program |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

Metrolink riders can ride most buses in Los Angeles and Orange County, as well as the Metro Rail, free with their valid ticket or pass, and monthly pass holders in Orange and Ventura Counties can use Amtrak Pacific Surfliner and Thruway Coach services through the Rail 2 Rail program.<ref name=EZTransit>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/fares/?id=6 |title=Metrolink Considering Raising Fares Due to Higher Fuel Costs |publisher=Metrolink |date=26 April 2005|accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

The rail system experiences its peak ridership during weekday mornings and afternoons.<ref name=FreeCarl>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/AS+FUEL+PRICES+INCREASE,+METROLINK+RIDERSHIP+SOARS.-a083961853 |title=As Fuel Prices Increase, Metrolink Ridership Soars |work=Daily News |publisher=The Free Library|last=Schiermeyer |first=Carl |date=1996 |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> To reflect the demand of its mostly-commuter ridership base, most Metrolink trains operate in the morning between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. and in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. Even lines with high ridership (such as the San Bernardino line) operate very few trains outside of the commuter rush hour schedule.<ref name=Schedules /> Metrolink has been willing to add additional trains when funding becomes available, as was the case in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], when the county decided to subsidize more service.<ref name=LATimesOC>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-14/local/me-24009_1_orange-county |title=Metrolink Adds 2 More Trains Per Day for Orange County |last=Berkman |first=Leslie |date=14 July 1995 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==Rail lines==
As a commuter rail line, Metrolink serves mainly to connect Los Angeles to its adjacent suburbs and provide increased accessibility to employment and activity centers.<ref name=MetrolinkAbout /> The system offers travel to a diverse list of destinations, including [[Downtown Los Angeles]], [[Bob Hope Airport]], [[California State University, Los Angeles]], [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Angel Stadium]], and the San Clemente Pier.<ref name=Stations>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/stations/ |title=Stations |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> Special service has also been extended to the [[Fairplex|Pomona Fairplex]],<ref name=PomonaFairplex>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/news/?id=237 |title=Metrolink to Make Special Stops at Fair |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> the [[Ventura, California#Points of interest|Ventura Fairgrounds]],<ref name=VenturaFairgrounds>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/news/?id=212 |title=Metrolink to Again Offer Service to Ventura County Fair |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> and the [[Auto Club Speedway]]<ref name=VenturaFairgrounds>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolinktrains.com/spevents/?id=31 |title=Take Metrolink to the Auto Club Speedway for NASCAR Action! |publisher=Metrolink |accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> for certain events.

==Maintenance facilities==
[[Image:Inside-metrolink.JPG|thumb|The upper level of a Metrolink passenger car]]
===Central Maintenance Facility===
Metrolink's Central Maintenance Facility (CMF) is located on the east bank of the [[Los Angeles River]] near the intersection of the 5 and 110 Freeways, just south of the location of the former Southern Pacific Taylor Yard.<ref name=RiverProject>{{cite web |url=http://www.theriverproject.org/tayloryard/history.html |title=Taylor Yard History |work=The River Project |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> The facility is operated by Metrolink's equipment maintenance contractor, Bombardier Transportation.<ref name=Bombardier>{{cite web |url=http://www.bombardier.com/en/transportation/about-transportation/worldwide-presence?docID=0901260d8000ede1# |title=Bombardier Transportation in the USA |publisher=Bombardier |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

===Camp Pendleton Maintenance Facility===
Metrolink's [[Camp Pendleton]] Facility is located between San Clemente Pier Station and Oceanside Station at the southwest end of Camp Pendleton. This yard is owned by the northern San Diego county [[North County Transit District]] and also services [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]] trains.<ref name=Bombardier />

==Expansion==
Metrolink has grown in popularity in parallel with rising gas prices and the increasing cost of driving. In addition to higher ridership, station parking capacity has also been strained.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reyes |first=David |title=Metrolink growth strains station parking capacity |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date= July 5, 2008 |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/orange/la-me-stations5-2008jul05,0,5218936.story |accessdate=2008-07-07 }}</ref>

In 2005, the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] approved a plan to increase frequencies to 76 trains daily on the Orange County and Inland Empire-Orange County Lines by 2009,<ref name=OCRDouble>{{cite news |title=Metrolink daily O.C. service to nearly double |last=Radcliffe |first=Jim |newspaper=Orange County Register |date=14 November 2005 |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/service-30056-county-metrolink.html }}</ref> and funding for increased Metrolink service was included in the renewal of the Measure M sales tax for transportation approved by voters in November 2006.<ref name=OCTAM2>{{cite web |url=http://www.octa.net/M2Home.aspx?entryid=332 |title=Measure M2 |publisher=Orange County Transportation Authority |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> However, in 2010, to save money in the face of funding cuts, the Metrolink board voted to reduce mid-day service on the Inland Empire<U+2013>Orange County Line, as well as weekend service on both the Orange County and Inland Empire<U+2013>Orange County lines.<ref name=LATimesWeekendCuts>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/01/metrolink-cuts-some-weekend-service-but-fares-stay-put-for-now.html |title=Metrolink cuts some weekend trains, but fares stay put |last=Connell |first=Rich |date=8 January 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>

Future plans also call for line expansions extending Metrolink's service area. The proposed [[91 Line]] extension, known officially as the [[Perris Valley Line]], will link [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] and [[Perris, California|Perris]] by 2012.<ref name=Perris>{{cite web |url=http://www.perrisvalleyline.info/schedule.asp |title=Project Schedule |publisher=Riverside County Transportation Commission |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:Metrolink trains outside Union Station.jpg|left|thumb|Metrolink trains approaching and leaving Union Station during the evening rush hour]]A proposed station in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] was canceled in 2005 due to local opposition. Instead, a [[Placentia, California|Placentia]] Metrolink station which will serve the 91 Line's north Orange County passengers is currently in its final design phase. Construction on the Placentia station will begin in 2012 or 2013; it will be the only station on the 91 Line not shared by another Metrolink line.<ref name=Placentia>{{cite web |url=http://www.octa.net/pdf/Placentia_MetrolinkFactsheet.pdf |title=Placentia Metrolink Station |date=28 January 2009 |publisher=Orange County Transportation Authority |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

The Redlands Corridor, a {{convert|9|mi|km|sing=on}} eastward extension linking [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] with [[Redlands, California|Redlands]] and [[Mentone, California|Mentone]],  is planned by the [[San Bernardino Associated Governments]]. The association is considering whether to extend [[commuter rail]] along the corridor or to install either [[bus rapid transit]] or [[light rail]] lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanbag.ca.gov/projects/redlands-transit.html |title=Passenger Rail Extension to Redlands |publisher=San Bernardino Associated Governments |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

The [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] has proposed adding commuter rail service along the [[Harbor Subdivision (BNSF)|Harbor Subdivision]] corridor, so as to provide service to [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Los Angeles International Airport]], the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]], the [[Port of Los Angeles]], and/or the [[Port of Long Beach]]. A decision whether to employ commuter rail, light rail, or bus rapid transit in this corridor has not yet been reached.<ref name=MTAHarbor>{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.net/projects_studies/harbor_subdivision/images/AA_study/03-Alternatives.pdf |title=Metro Harbor Subdivision Transit Corridor Alternatives Analysis Report <U+2013> Final |date=November 2009 |work=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref>

In 2008, lobbyists pushed for a rail line to [[Temecula, California|Temecula]] in southwestern Riverside County via the 91 Line's [[Riverside-La Sierra (Metrolink station)|La Sierra station]].<ref name=RCTCFeasability>{{cite web |url=http://www.rctc.org/downloads/railfeasibilitystudy_2008.pdf |title=I-15 Commuter Rail Feasibility Study |date=29 June 2007 |publisher=Wilbur Smith Associates |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> While this proposed line could follow the route of an abandoned freight line, it would require significant money as freight service ceased almost 30 years ago. Despite this, the Riverside County Transportation Commission's 2008 Commuter Rail Feasibility Study still lists this route as one possibility being considered.<ref name=RCTCStudy>{{cite web |url=http://www.rctc.org/2008commuterrailstudy.asp |title=2008 Commuter Rail Feasibility Study |date=2008 |publisher=Riverside County Transportation Commission |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

The cities of the [[Coachella Valley]] ([[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], [[Cathedral City, California|Cathedral City]], [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]], and [[Indio, California|Indio]]) have requested commuter rail service from Los Angeles and Orange County, but the Union Pacific Railroad opposes further passenger service on its tracks.<ref name=CVAG>{{cite web |url=http://rctc.geoclients.com/coachellavalleyrailservice.asp |title=Coachella Valley Rail Service |publisher=Riverside County Transportation Commission |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> Nonetheless, as recently as 1999, the [[Coachella Valley Association of Governments]] was investigating the possibility of two daily round trips via the 91 Line from Los Angeles's [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] through Fullerton and Riverside to stations in Palm Springs and Indio (with a possible stop near [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]]),<ref name=RCTCCoachella>{{cite web |url=http://www.rctc.org/downloads/1999%20Coachella%20Valley%20Rail%20Study.pdf |title=Coachella Valley Passenger Rail Feasibility Study |date=February 1999 |publisher=Schiermeyer Consulting Services |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> possibly through a partnership with [[Amtrak]]. What effect these might have on the 91 Line's Perris Valley extension (or vice versa) is not discussed. This extension would likewise require significant money for infrastructure improvements: at least $500 million, according to the California State Rail Plan of 2005.<ref name=CVAG/>

===Livery===
Most Metrolink-owned units are painted in the Metrolink livery, white with periwinkle blue streaks. The agency is currently in the process of rolling out a new blue and green "ribbons" design. Locomotives are being given the new livery during downtime for maintenance and the new Rotem Bi-level cars are coming from the factory with the updated designed already applied.<ref name=MetrolinkMattersMarchApril2010 />

==Major accidents==
===Placentia, April 2002===
On April 23, 2002, a [[BNSF Railway]] freight train collided head-on with a Metrolink train in [[Placentia, California|Placentia]], near the [[Atwood, California|Atwood Junction]], at the intersection of Orangethorpe Avenue and Van Buren Street. Both trains were on the same east<U+2013>west track moving toward one another. The Metrolink had the right-of-way; it was supposed to switch to a southbound track. The BNSF train was supposed to slow and stop just before the switch while the Metrolink passed, but the crew missed a signal one and a half miles back warning them to slow down. By the time the crew saw the red "stop" signal at the switch and the Metrolink train, they were going too fast to avoid a collision. Although there was speculation that the signals alerting the BNSF to slow and stop had malfunctioned, an investigation later concluded that it was human error by the crew that caused the accident. Two people died in the crash and twenty-two were seriously injured.<ref>{{cite web

===Glendale, January 2005===
{{Main|2005 Glendale train crash}}
On January 26, 2005, a Metrolink passenger train collided with a vehicle parked on the tracks, and as a result derailed and jackknifed, striking a stationary freight locomotive and a Metrolink train moving in the opposite direction in what was then the deadliest train accident in Metrolink's history.  Eleven people were killed (including an off-duty sheriff's deputy and a train conductor) and over 100 people were injured, about 40 seriously. The man who parked the vehicle on the tracks, [[Juan Manuel Alvarez]], was apprehended and charged with 11 counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, including murder by train wrecking.<ref name=LATimesCharges>{{cite news |title=Man Faces Charges in Metrolink Collision |first=Michael |last=Muskal |first2=Jesus |last2=Sanchez |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=26 January 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/la-012605crash_lat,0,7433465.story}}</ref><ref name=LATimesVerdict>{{cite news |title=Verdict in train wreck: murder |first=Ann M. |last=Simmons |first2=Jack |last2=Leonard |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/27/local/me-metrolink27}}</ref> On June 26, 2008, Alvarez was convicted on the 11 murder counts and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.<ref name=LATimesConvicted>{{cite news |title=Metrolink killer gets 11 life terms, no parole |first=Ann M. |last=Simmons |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=21 August 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/21/local/me-metrolink21}}</ref>
