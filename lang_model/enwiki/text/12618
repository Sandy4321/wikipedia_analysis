==Overview==
{{Intelligent Design}}
Intelligent design is presented as an alternative to [[natural science|natural]] explanations for the development of life. It stands in opposition to conventional [[biology|biological]] science, which relies on the [[scientific method]] to explain [[life]] through observed physical processes such as [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]]. 

The stated purpose of Intelligent Design (ID) is to investigate whether or not existing [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence implies that [[life on Earth]] must have been designed by an [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] agent or agents. [[William A. Dembski]], one of intelligent design's leading proponents, has stated that the fundamental claim of intelligent design is that "there are natural systems that cannot be adequately explained in terms of undirected natural forces and that exhibit features which in any other circumstance we would attribute to intelligence."<ref>Dembski. The Design Revolution. pg. 27 2004 </ref> In a leaked memo, commonly known as [[Wedge strategy|The Wedge Document]], however, the supporters of the movement were told, "We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."<ref name=wedge1>Though intelligent design proponents say publicly the purpose of ID is search for design, they've stated a very different goal to their constituency: 
<cite>"We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID).

"Yet the express strategic objectives of the Discovery Institute; the writings, careers, and affiliations of ID<U+2019>s leading proponents; and the movement<U+2019>s funding sources all betray a clear moral and religious agenda."</cite> [http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10084 Inferior Design] Chris Mooney. The American Prospect, [[August 10]] [[2005]] ''and'' <cite>"ID's rejection of naturalism in any form logically entails its appeal to the only alternative, supernaturalism, as a putatively scientific explanation for natural phenomena. This makes ID a religious belief."</cite> [http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/experts/Forrest_expert_report.pdf Expert Witness Report] [[Barbara Forrest]] [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]],  April 2005. (PDF file) </ref>

Proponents of intelligent design look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] of what they term "signs of intelligence": [[physical property|physical properties]] of an object that point to a designer (''see'': [[teleological argument]]). For example, if an archeologist finds a statue made of stone in a field, he may, ID proponents argue, justifiably conclude that the statue was designed and then reasonably seek to identify the statue's designer. He would not, however, be justified in making the same claim if he found an irregularly shaped boulder of the same size.

The most commonly cited "signs of intelligence" include [[irreducible complexity]], information mechanisms, and [[specified complexity]]. Design proponents argue that living systems show one or more of these, from which they infer that some aspects of life have been designed. 

Intelligent design proponents say that although evidence pointing to the nature of an "intelligent cause or agent" may not be directly [[observation|observable]], its effects on nature can be detected. Dembski, in ''Signs of Intelligence'', states: "Proponents of intelligent design regard it as a scientific research program that investigates the effects of intelligent causes. Note that intelligent design studies the ''effects'' of intelligent causes and not intelligent causes ''per se''." In his view, one cannot test for the identity of influences exterior to a closed system from within, so questions concerning the identity of a designer fall outside the realm of the concept. However, no rigorous test that can identify these effects has yet been proposed.<ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/06/dembskis_profound_lack_of_comp.php MarkCC, ''Good Math/Bad Math'', "Dembski's Profound Lack of Comprehension of Information Theory"]: "In this paper, as usual, he's spending rather a lot of time avoiding defining specification. Purportedly, he's doing a survey of the mathematical techniques that can be used to define specification. Of course, while rambling on and on, he manages to never actually say just what the hell specification is - just goes on and on with various discussions of what it ''could be.''" [http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/11/bad_news_for_uncommon_descent_1.php Ibid, "Bad News for Uncommon Descent"] "In information science, it has never been shown that there exists any quantity that can be referred to as "specified complexity". They keep trying to foist the idea on readers as if it's an accepted part of the mathematical theory of information, but they even ''agree'' ''[sic: should be "can't even"]'' on what it is, much less present an actual mathematical definition."</ref>

===Origins of the concept===
Philosophers have long debated whether the complexity of nature indicates the existence of a purposeful natural or supernatural designer/creator. The first recorded arguments for a natural designer come from [[Greek philosophy]].  In the 4th century BC, [[Plato]] posited a natural "[[demiurge]]" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. [[Aristotle]]  also developed the idea of a natural creator of the cosmos, often called the "[[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]]," in his work ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. In ''De Natura Deorum'', or "''On the Nature of the Gods''" (45 BC), [[Cicero]] stated that "the divine power is to be found in a principle of reason which pervades the whole of nature."<ref>[[Cicero]], ''De Natura Deorum'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/nd.shtml Latin Library].</ref>

The use of this line of reasoning as applied to a supernatural designer has come to be known as the [[teleological argument]] for the existence of [[God]]. The most notable forms of this argument were expressed in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'',<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologiae]]''. "[http://www.faithnet.org.uk/AS%20Subjects/Philosophyofreligion/fiveways.htm Thomas Aquinas' 'Five Ways']" in ''faithnet.org.uk''. He [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 2: context#Page 24 of 139|framed the argument]] as a [[syllogism]]: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer.</ref> design being the fifth of Aquinas' five proofs for God's existence, and by [[William Paley]] in his book ''Natural Theology'' (1802).<ref>[[William Paley]], ''[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/p/pd-modeng/pd-modeng-idx?type=header&id=PaleyNatur Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]'', 1809, London, Twelfth Edition.</ref> Paley used the [[watchmaker analogy]], which is still used in intelligent design arguments. In the early 19th century, such arguments led to the development of what was called [[natural theology]], the study of [[biology]] as a search to understand "the mind of God." This movement fueled the passion for collecting fossils and other biological specimens that ultimately led to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[Origin of Species|the origin of species]]. Similar reasoning postulating a divine designer is embraced today by many believers in [[theistic evolution]], who consider modern science and the theory of [[evolution]] to be fully compatible with the concept of a supernatural designer. 

Intelligent design in the late 20th century can be seen as a modern development of natural theology which seeks to change the basis of science and undermine evolution theory. As evolutionary theory has expanded to explain more phenomena, the examples that are held up as evidence of design have changed. But the essential argument remains the same: complex systems imply a designer. Examples offered in the past included the eye (optical system) and the feathered wing; current examples are mostly [[biochemical]]: protein functions, blood clotting, and bacterial [[flagella]] (see [[irreducible complexity]]).

The earliest known version of the particular line of reasoning that would come to be called "intelligent design" began, according to [[Barbara Forrest|Dr Barbara Forrest]], "in the early 1980s with the publication of ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'' (MoLO 1984) by creationist chemist [[Charles Thaxton|Charles B. Thaxton]] with Walter L. Bradley and Roger L. Olsen. Thaxton worked for Jon A. Buell at the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] (FTE) in Texas, a religious organization that published MoLO."<ref>Dr Barbara Forrest. [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/3/11/8448/52824 Know Your Creationists: Know Your Allies] </ref>

Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific [[intelligent designer|agent of creation]] &ndash; it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the [[Christianity|Christian]] god.<ref name=dembski_logos>Dembski: <cite>"Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory,"</cite>  [http://touchstonemag.com/archives/issue.php?id=49 Touchstone Magazine. Volume 12, Issue4: July/August, 1999]</ref><ref name=wedge1/><ref name=wedge2>Phillip Johnson: <cite>"''Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of Intelligent Design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.''"</cite> Johnson 2004. Christianity.ca. [http://www.christianity.ca/news/social-issues/2004/03.001.html Let's Be Intelligent About Darwin].  <cite>"''This isn't really, and never has been a debate about science. It's about religion and philosophy.''"</cite> Johnson 1996. World Magazine. [http://www.leaderu.com/pjohnson/world2.html Witnesses For The Prosecution]. <cite>"''So the question is: "How to win?" That's when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the [[Wedge strategy|"wedge" strategy]]: "Stick with the most important thing"<U+2014>the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, "Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?" and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.''"</cite> Johnson 2000. Touchstone magazine. [http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html Berkeley's Radical An Interview with Phillip E. Johnson]</ref>  Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] court ruling held the latter to be the case.

===Origins of the term===
Though unrelated to the current use of the term, the phrase "intelligent design" can be found in an 1847 issue of ''Scientific American'' and in an 1850 book by [[Patrick Edward Dove]].<ref>[[Patrick Edward Dove|Dove, Patrick Edward]], The theory of human progression, and natural probability of a reign of justice. London, Johnstone & Hunter, 1850. LC 08031381 "Intelligence-Intelligent Design."</ref>  The term is also used in an address to the 1873 annual meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] by [[William Paley|Paleyite]] botanist [[George James Allman]]:

<blockquote>No physical hypothesis founded on any indisputable fact has yet explained the origin of the primordial protoplasm, and, above all, of its marvellous properties, which render evolution possible&mdash;in heredity and in adaptability, for these properties are the cause and not the effect of evolution. For the cause of this cause we have sought in vain among the physical forces which surround us, until we are at last compelled to rest upon an independent volition, a far-seeing intelligent design.<ref>'The British Association', ''The Times'', Saturday, [[20 September]] [[1873]]; pg. 10; col A. </ref></blockquote>

The term can be found again in ''Humanism'', a 1903 book by one of the founders of classical [[pragmatism]], [[Ferdinand Canning Scott Schiller|F.C.S. Schiller]]: "It will not be possible to rule out the supposition that the process of evolution may be guided by an intelligent design." A derivative of the term appears in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1967) in the article on the [[Teleological argument|''Telological argument for the existence of God'']] : "Stated most succinctly, [the argument] runs: The world exhibits [[teleological]] order (design, adaptation).  Therefore, it was produced by an intelligent designer."  The term "intelligent design" was also used in the early 1980s by Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] as part of his promotion of [[panspermia]].<ref>'Evolution according to Hoyle: Survivors of disaster in an earlier world', By Nicholas Timmins, ''The Times'', Wednesday, [[13 January]] [[1982]]; pg. 22; Issue 61130; col F. </ref> 

The predominant modern use of the term began after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in the case of [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] (1987), ruled that [[creationism]] is unconstitutional in public school science curricula. [[Stephen C. Meyer]], cofounder of the [[Discovery Institute]] and vice president of the [[Center for Science and Culture]], reports that the term came up in 1988 at a conference he attended in [[Tacoma, Washington]], called ''Sources of Information Content in DNA''.<ref>William Safire. The New York Times. [[August 21]] [[2005]].[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/magazine/21ONLANGUAGE.html?position=&ei=5090&en=f2de0d764cc7e0e8&ex=1282276800&adxnnl=1&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&adxnnlx=1132902202-gyP0H4EZfG7IeNHPMWlcBw  On Language: Neo-Creo] </ref> He attributes the phrase to [[Charles Thaxton]], editor of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''. In drafts of the book ''Of Pandas and People'', the word 'creationism' was subsequently changed, almost without exception, to ''intelligent design''. The book was published in 1989 and is considered to be the first intelligent design book.<ref>National Association of Biology Teachers. [http://www.nabt.org/sub/evolution/panda1.asp A Reader's Guide to Of Pandas and People] National Center for Science Education. [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8442_1_introduction_iof_pandas__11_23_2004.asp Of Pandas and People, the foundational work of the Intelligent Design movement] </ref> The term was promoted more broadly by the retired legal scholar [[Phillip E. Johnson]] following his 1991 book ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'', which advocated redefining science to allow claims of supernatural creation.<ref>"Although science has made great progress by limiting itself to explaining only through natural causes, Johnson would have us allow the occasional supernatural intervention for those phenomena that cause problems for his particular theology. Though he has no objection to natural explanations for how fluids pass through a cell membrane, we need to leave room for a "whimsical creator" (p. 31) or God<U+2019>s "inscrutable purpose" (p. 71) to explain the origin of life or the origin of complex body plans. Confusing unsolved with unsolveable, he wishes us to stop seeking natural causes for these phenomena. Johnson wishes to take us back to an earlier, less scientifically productive time when science had to wait for religious approval before daring to explain something that was religiously sensitive."

[[NCSE]]</ref>  Johnson, considered the "father" of the [[intelligent design movement]], went on to work with Meyer, becoming the program advisor of the [[Center for Science and Culture]] in forming and executing the [[wedge strategy]].

==Concepts==
===Irreducible complexity===
{{main|Irreducible complexity}}
In the context of intelligent design, irreducible complexity was put forth by [[Michael Behe]], who defines it as "a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."<ref>Behe, Michael (1997): ''Molecular Machines: Experimental Support for the Design Inference'' [http://www.apologetics.org/machines.html]</ref>

Behe uses the [[analogy]] of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces <U+2014> the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer <U+2014> all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe's original examples of alleged<ref>Irreducible complexity of these examples is disputed; see Kitzmiller, pp. 76-78, and [http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/ken_miller_webc.html Ken Miller Webcast] </ref><ref>The Collapse of "Irreducible Complexity" Kenneth R. Miller Brown University[http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/design2/article.html]</ref> irreducibly complex biological mechanisms instead include the bacterial [[flagellum]] of ''[[E. coli]]'', the [[blood clotting]] cascade, [[cilia]], and the adaptive [[immune system]].

Critics point out<ref> John H. McDonald's "[http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html reducibly complex mousetrap]"</ref><ref>David Ussery, "[http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/staff/dave/Behe.html A Biochemist's Response to 'The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution']"</ref> that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially. They argue that something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the "scaffolding objection" by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an "irreducibly complex" building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.<ref>For example, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5770/97 Bridgham ''et al.'']showed that gradual evolutionary mechanisms can produce complex protein-protein interaction systems from simpler precursors. {{cite journal| author =Bridgham ''et al.'' | year =2006| title = Evolution of Hormone-Receptor Complexity by Molecular Exploitation| journal =Science| volume =312 | issue =5770 | pages =97 - 101}}</ref>
Behe himself has since confessed to "sloppy prose," and that his "argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof."<ref>{{cite news | last = Orr | first = H. Allen | title = Devolution | publisher = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 2005-05-30 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact }} This article draws from the following exchange of letters in which Behe admits to sloppy prose and non-logical proof: {{cite web | last = Behe | first = M. | coauthors = Dembski, Wells, Nelson, Berlinski | title = Has Darwin met his match?

===Specified complexity===
{{main|Specified complexity}}
The intelligent design concept of "specified complexity" was developed by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian [[William Dembski]]. Dembski states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and specified, simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: "A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]] is both complex and specified."<ref>Dembski. Intelligent Design, p. 47 </ref> He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the "patterns" of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as [[DNA]].

Dembski defines complex specified information as anything with a less than 1 in 10<sup>150</sup> chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]: Complex specified information (CSI) cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.

The conceptual soundness of Dembski's specified complexity/CSI argument is strongly disputed by the scientific community.<ref>Nowak quoted. Claudia Wallis. Time Magazine, [[15 August]] [[2005]] edition, page 32 [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html Evolution Wars] </ref> Specified complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other fields as Dembski asserts. John Wilkins and [[Wesley R. Elsberry|Wesley Elsberry]] characterize Dembski's "explanatory filter" as ''eliminative'', because it eliminates explanations sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to design. They argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions.<ref>John S. Wilkins and Wesley R. Elsberry. Biology and Philosophy, 16: 711-724. 2001.

===Fine-tuned universe===
{{main|Fine-tuned universe}}
Intelligent design proponents also raise occasional arguments outside biology, most notably an argument based on the [[anthropic principle]] that the universe is "fine-tuned," an argument that claims that the many features that make life possible cannot be attributed to chance. These include the values of [[fundamental physical constants]], the strength of [[nuclear force]]s, [[electromagnetism]], electron-neutron mass ratios and [[gravity]], as well as a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of the thermodynamic concept of [[entropy]].<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3122 Evolution's Thermodynamic Failure]</ref><ref>[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo/entropy.html Entropy, Disorder and Life]</ref> Intelligent design proponent and [[Center for Science and Culture]] fellow [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, with many [[chemical elements]] and features of the universe like [[galaxies]] being impossible to form.<ref>{{cite book|author=Guillermo Gonzalez|title=The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery|year=2004|id=ISBN 0-89526-065-4}} </ref>Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome. Scientists almost unanimously have responded that this argument cannot be tested and is not scientifically productive. Some scientists argue that even when taken as mere speculation, these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.<ref>The Panda's Thumb. [http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000390.html review of The Privileged Planet] </ref> 

Critics of both intelligent design and the [[Anthropic principle#Variants of the anthropic principle|weak form]] of the [[anthropic principle]] argue that they are essentially a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]; in their view, these arguments amount to the claim that life is able to exist because the universe is able to support life.<ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf#search=%22Fine%20tuned%20universe%22 Is The Universe Fine-Tuned For Us?] Victor J.

Life as we know it might not exist if things were different, but a different sort of life might exist in its place. A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.<ref>''See, e.g.,'' Gerald Feinberg and Robert Shapiro, "A Puddlian Fable" in Huchingson, ''Religion and the Natural Sciences'' (1993), pp. 220-221</ref>

===Intelligent designer=== 

{{main|Intelligent designer}}

Intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Though Dembski in ''The Design Inference'' speculates that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements, the authoritative description of intelligent design<ref>"The theory of Intelligent Design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.''" Discovery Institute. What is Intelligent Design? [http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign Questions About Intelligent Design] </ref> explicitly states that the ''universe'' displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the [[paradox]], Dembski concludes that "no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life."<ref>Dembski. [http://www.leaderu.com/offices/dembski/docs/bd-the_ac.html The Act of Creation: Bridging Transcendence and Immanence] </ref> The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the [[Christianity|Christian]] god, to the exclusion of all other religions.<ref name=dembski_logos/>

Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics go so far as to argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, Jerry Coyne, of the [[University of Chicago]], asks why a designer would "give us a pathway for making vitamin C, but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes" and why he or she would not "stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species." Coyne also points to the fact that "the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref>Jerry Coyne. [[The New Republic]], [[August 22]] 2005. [http://www.tnr.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20050822&s=coyne082205 The Case Against Intelligent Design] </ref> Arguing to the contrary in this broader context, Behe argued in ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively.  Odd designs could, for example, "have been placed there by the designer... for artistic reasons, to show off, for some as-yet undetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason." Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, "either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved."

Asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question "What designed the designer?"<ref>Dr. Donald E. Simanek. [http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/philosop/empty.htm Intelligent Design: The Glass is Empty] </ref> Intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design.<ref>IDEA <cite>"One need not fully understand the origin or identity of the designer to determine that an object was designed. Thus, this question is essentially irrelevant to intelligent design theory, which merely seeks to detect if an object was designed... Intelligent design theory cannot address the identity or origin of the designer - it is a philosophical / religious question that lies outside the domain of scientific inquiry. Christianity postulates the religious answer to this question that the designer is God who by definition is eternally existent and has no origin. There is no logical philosophical impossibility with this being the case (akin to [[Aristotle]]'s 'unmoved mover') as a religious answer to the origin of the designer..."</cite> FAQ: Who designed the designer? [http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1147 FAQ: Who designed the designer?] </ref> Richard Wein counters that the unanswered questions a theory creates "must be balanced against the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides. Invoking an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings (ourselves) is little more than [[Begging the question|question-begging]]. The new question raised by the explanation is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to answer."<ref>Richard Wein. 2002. [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/choc_nfl.cfm#unembodied Not a Free Lunch But a Box of Chocolates] </ref> Dawkins sees the claim that the designer does not need to be explained, not as a contribution to knowledge, but as a [[thought-terminating clich<U+00E9>]].<ref>[http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/designer.html Who Designed the Designer?] Jason Rosenhouse.

==Movement==
{{main|Intelligent design movement}}

[[Image:Time evolution wars.jpg|thumb|[[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] cover, [[August 15]] 2005]] 

The intelligent design movement arose out of an organized [[Neo-Creationism|neocreationist]] campaign directed by the [[Discovery Institute]] to promote a religious agenda<ref><cite>"The social consequences of materialism have been devastating. As symptoms, those consequences are certainly worth treating. However, we are convinced that in order to defeat materialism, we must cut it off at its source. That source is scientific materialism. This is precisely our strategy. If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a 'wedge' that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the 'thin edge of the wedge,' was Phillip Johnson's critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in Darwinism on Trial, and continued in Reason in the Balance and Defeatng Darwinism by Opening Minds. Michael Behe's highly successful Darwin's Black Box followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."</cite> [http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf Wedge Document] Discovery Institute, 1999. (PDF file)</ref> calling for broad social, academic and political changes employing intelligent design arguments in the public sphere, primarily in the [[United States]]. Leaders of the movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the [[secular]] philosophy of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]]. Intelligent design proponents allege that science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand the adoption of a naturalistic [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]] that dismisses out of hand any explanation which contains a supernatural cause. The overall goal of the movement is to "defeat [the] [[Materialism|materialist]] [[world view]]" represented by the theory of [[evolution]] in favor of "a science consonant with [[Christian]] and [[Theism|theistic]] convictions." <ref name="wedge_doc">[http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf Wedge Document] Discovery Institute, 1999.</ref>

[[Phillip E. Johnson]] stated that the goal of intelligent design is to cast [[creationism]] as a scientific concept.<ref name=wedge2/><ref name=PJC><cite>"''I have built an intellectual movement in the universities and churches that we call The Wedge, which is devoted to scholarship and writing that furthers this program of questioning the materialistic basis of science."..."Now the way that I see the logic of our movement going is like this. The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, well, where might you get the truth?"..."I start with John 1:1. In the beginning was the word. In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right. And the materialist scientists are deluding themselves.''"</cite> Johnson 1999. Reclaiming America for Christ Conference. [http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp How the Evolution Debate Can Be Won] </ref> All leading intelligent design proponents are fellows or staff of the Discovery Institute and its [[Center for Science and Culture]].<ref>Discovery Institute fellows and staff. [http://www.discovery.org/fellows/ ] Center for Science and Culture fellows and staff. [http://www.discovery.org/csc/fellows.php ]</ref> Nearly all intelligent design concepts and the associated movement are the products of the Discovery Institute, which guides the movement and follows its [[wedge strategy]] while conducting its adjunct [[Teach the Controversy]] campaign.

Leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design. In statements directed at the general public, they say intelligent design is not religious; when addressing conservative Christian supporters, they state that intelligent design has its foundation in the [[Bible]].<ref name=PJC/> Recognizing the need for support, the institute affirms its Christian, evangelistic orientation: "''Alongside a focus on influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidences that support the faith, as well as to 'popularize' our ideas in the broader culture.''"<ref name="wedge_doc"/>

[[Barbara Forrest]], an expert who has written extensively on the movement, describes this as being due to the Discovery Institute's obfuscating its agenda as a matter of policy. She has written that the movement's "activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious world-view that undergirds it."<ref>Barbara Forrest. 2001. "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/wedge.html The Wedge at Work: Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics]</ref>

===Religion and leading proponents===
Intelligent design's arguments are formulated in [[secular]] terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Phillip E. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of [[theism|theistic]] [[creationism]] is a necessary first step for ultimately reintroducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes that "the first thing that has to be done is to get the [[Bible]] out of the discussion" and that "after we have separated [[scientific materialism|materialist]] [[prejudice]] from scientific fact ... only then can 'biblical issues' be discussed."<ref>Phillip Johnson. Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity. July/August 1999.<cite>"...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact."</cite> [http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/le_wedge.htm The Wedge] </ref> Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design identified "as just another way of packaging the [[evangelical Christian|Christian evangelical]] message."<ref>Phillip Johnson. Keeping the Darwinists Honest, an interview with Phillip Johnson. Citizen Magazine. April 1999. <cite>"Intelligent Design is an intellectual movement, and the Wedge strategy stops working when we are seen as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message. ... The evangelists do what they do very well, and I hope our work opens up for them some doors that have been closed."</cite> </ref> Most of the principal intelligent design advocates, including [[Michael Behe]], [[William Dembski]], and [[Stephen C. Meyer]], are Christians who have stated that in their view the designer of life is [[God]]. The vast majority of leading intelligent design proponents are [[Evangelism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]].  [[Jonathan Wells (creationist)]], another principal advocate, is a member of the [[Unification Church]], headed by [[Reverend Moon|Reverend Sun-Myung Moon]].

The conflicting claims made by leading intelligent design advocates as to whether or not intelligent design is rooted in religious conviction are the result of their [[wedge strategy|strategy]]. For example, William Dembski, in his book ''The Design Inference'',<ref name="Design Inference">William Dembski, 1998. The Design Inference.</ref> lists a [[god]] or an "[[extraterrestrial life|alien life force]]" as two possible options for the identity of the designer. However, in his book ''Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology,'' Dembski states that "Christ is indispensable to any scientific theory, even if its practitioners don't have a clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific theory can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ."<ref>Dembski, 1999. Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology. ''"Christ is indispensable to any scientific theory, even if its practitioners don't have a clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific theory can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ."'' p. 210</ref> Dembski also stated, "ID is part of God's [[general revelation]] [...] Not only does intelligent design rid us of this ideology ([[materialism]]), which suffocates the human spirit, but, in my personal experience, I've found that it opens the path for people to come to Christ."<ref>Dembski. 2005. Intelligent Design's Contribution to the Debate Over Evolution: A Reply to Henry Morris.[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.02.Reply_to_Henry_Morris.htm Reply to Henry Morris]</ref> 

Two leading intelligent design proponents, Phillip Johnson and William Dembski, cite the Bible's [[Book of John]] as the foundation of intelligent design.<ref name=dembski_logos/><ref name=PJC/> Barbara Forrest contends that such statements reveal that leading proponents see intelligent design as essentially religious in nature, as opposed to a scientific concept that has implications with which their personal religious beliefs happen to coincide.<ref>Barbara Forrest. Expert Testimony. ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial transcript, Day 6 ([[October 5]]) <cite>"What I am talking about is the essence of intelligent design, and the essence of it is theistic realism as defined by Professor Johnson. Now that stands on its own quite apart from what their motives are. I'm also talking about the definition of intelligent design by Dr. Dembski as the Logos theology of John's Gospel. That stands on its own." ... "Intelligent design, as it is understood by the proponents that we are discussing today, does involve a supernatural creator, and that is my objection. And I am objecting to it as they have defined it, as Professor Johnson has defined intelligent design, and as Dr. Dembski has defined intelligent design. And both of those are basically religious. They involve the supernatural."</cite> </ref>

==Controversy==
A key strategy of the intelligent design movement is convincing the general public that there is a debate among scientists about whether life evolved, in order to convince the public, politicians and cultural leaders that schools should "[[teach the controversy]]."<ref>Seattle Times. [[March 31]] 2005.[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002225932_design31m.html Does Seattle group "teach controversy" or contribute to it?] </ref> However, there is no such debate within the scientific community; the [[scientific consensus]] is that life evolved.<ref>National Association of Biology Teachers [http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp Statement on Teaching Evolution]</ref><ref>[http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] [[Royal Society]] (PDF file)</ref><ref>From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the world's largest general scientific society: [http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf 2006 Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] (PDF file), [http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/0219boardstatement.shtml AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws]</ref>  Intelligent design is widely viewed as a [[stalking horse]] for its proponents' campaign against what they say is the [[Materialism|materialist]] foundation of science, which they argue leaves no room for the possibility of God.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/intelligent-design-a-trojan-horse-says-creationist/2005/11/26/1132966007431.html Intelligent design a Trojan horse, says creationist] Mark Coultan, Sydney Morning Herald [[November 27]] 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.au.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cs_2005_02_special Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse, A Conversation With Barbara Forrest] Americans United for Separation of Church and State, February 2005 </ref>

The intelligent design controversy centers on three issues:

# Can intelligent design be defined as science?
# If so, does the evidence support it and related explanations of the history of life on Earth?
# If the answer to either question is negative, is the teaching of such explanations appropriate and legal in public education?

[[Natural science]] uses the [[scientific method]] to create ''[[a posteriori]]'' knowledge based on observation alone (sometimes called [[empiricism|empirical science]]). Intelligent design proponents seek to change this definition<ref>Barbara Forrest, 2000. "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism: Clarifying the Connection]." In ''Philo,'' Vol. 3, No. 2 (Fall-Winter 2000), pp. 7-29.</ref> by eliminating "[[methodology|methodological]] [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]" from science<ref>Phillip E. Johnson. Reason in the Balance: The Case Against Naturalism in Science, Law and Education (InterVarsity Press, 1995), positions himself as a "theistic realist" against "methodological naturalism."</ref> and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design movement, [[Phillip E. Johnson]],  calls "[[theistic realism]]",<ref>Phillip Johnson.  <cite>"My colleagues and I speak of 'theistic realism'<U+2014> or sometimes, 'mere creation' <U+2014> as the defining concept of our [the ID] movement. This means that we affirm that God is objectively real as Creator, and that the reality of God is tangibly recorded in evidence accessible to science, particularly in biology."</cite>  [http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/ratzsch.htm Starting a Conversation about Evolution]</ref> and what critics call "methodological supernaturalism," which means belief in a transcendent, nonnatural dimension of reality inhabited by a transcendent, nonnatural deity. Intelligent design proponents argue that naturalistic explanations fail to explain certain phenomena and that supernatural explanations provide a very simple and intuitive<ref>Phillip E. Johnson, quoted. 2001. Teresa Watanabe. Los Angeles Times (Sunday Front page) [[March 25]] [[2001]]. <cite>"We are taking an intuition most people have and making it a scientific and academic enterprise,"</cite> Johnson said. In challenging Darwinism with a God-friendly alternative theory, the professor, who is a Presbyterian, added, <cite>"We are removing the most important cultural roadblock to accepting the role of God as creator."</cite> [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?programs=CSCstories&command=view&id=613 Enlisting Science to Find the Fingerprints of a Creator: Believers in 'intelligent design' try to redirect evolution disputes along intellectual lines]</ref> explanation for the origins of life and the universe. Proponents say that evidence exists in the forms of [[irreducible complexity]] and [[specified complexity]] that cannot be explained by natural processes.

Supporters also hold that religious neutrality requires the teaching of both evolution and intelligent design in schools, saying that teaching only evolution unfairly discriminates against those holding creationist beliefs.  [[teach the controversy|Teaching both]], they argue, allows for the possibility of religious belief, without causing the state to actually promote such beliefs.  Many intelligent design followers believe that "[[Scientism]]" is itself a religion that promotes [[secularism]] and [[materialism]] in an attempt to erase [[theism]] from public life, and they view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres. Some allege that this larger debate is often the subtext for arguments made over intelligent design, though others note that intelligent design serves as an effective proxy for the religious beliefs of prominent intelligent design proponents in their efforts to advance their religious point of view within society.<ref>Joel Belz, 1996. World Magazine. [http://www.leaderu.com/pjohnson/world2.html Witnesses For The Prosecution]</ref><ref>Phillip E. Johnson. American Family Radio. [[January 10]] 2003 <cite>"Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of Intelligent Design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools."</cite> [http://www.christianity.ca/news/social-issues/2004/03.001.html Let's Be Intelligent About Darwin]</ref><ref>Jon Buell & Virginia Hearn (eds), 1992. Proceedings of a Symposium entitled: [http://ebd10.ebd.csic.es/pdfs/DarwSciOrPhil.pdf Darwinism: Scientific Inference of Philosophical Preference?]" (PDF file)</ref>

According to critics, intelligent design has not presented a credible scientific case and is an attempt to teach religion in public schools, which the [[United States Constitution]] forbids under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]]. They allege that intelligent design has substituted public support for scientific research.<ref>[[Karl Giberson]]. [[Science & Theology News]], [[December 5]] [[2005]] [http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2439.htm Intelligent design<U+2019>s long march to nowhere] </ref> Furthermore, if one were to take the proponents of "equal time for all theories" at their word, there would be no logical limit to the number of potential "theories" to be taught in the public school system, including admittedly silly ones like the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] "theory" (a deliberate parody of intelligent design).  There are innumerable mutually incompatible supernatural explanations for complexity, and intelligent design does not provide a mechanism for discriminating among them.   Furthermore, intelligent design is neither observable nor repeatable, which critics argue violates the scientific requirement of [[falsifiability]]. Indeed, intelligent design proponent [[Michael Behe]] concedes "You can't prove intelligent design by experiment."<ref>Claudia Wallis. Time Magazine, [[August 15]] [[2005]]. page 32 [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html Evolution Wars]</ref>

Though evolution theory does not seek to explain [[abiogenesis]], the generation of life from nonliving matter, intelligent design proponents cannot ''infer'' that an intelligent designer is behind the part of the process that is not understood scientifically, since they have not shown that anything supernatural has occurred. The inference that an intelligent designer (a god or an alien life force)<ref name="Design Inference"/> created life on Earth has been compared to the ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' claim that aliens helped the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids.<ref>Michael J. Murray, n.d. [http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/Philosophy/staticpages/Murray/Providence.pdf Natural Providence (or Design Trouble)] (PDF file)</ref><ref>Dembski. [http://puffin.creighton.edu/NRCSE/NRCSEPosReID.html What is the position of the NRCSE on the teaching of intelligent design <nowiki>[ID]</nowiki> as an alternative to neo-Darwinian evolution in Nebraska schools?]</ref> In both cases, the effect of this outside intelligence is not repeatable, observable or falsifiable, and it violates the principle of [[parsimony]].  From a strictly [[empiricism|empirical]] standpoint, one may list what is known about Egyptian construction techniques, but one must admit ignorance about exactly how the Egyptians built the pyramids.  <!--paraphrasing http://www.prospect.org/print/V13/22/mooney-c.html: "intelligent design advocates don't always articulate precisely what sort of intelligence they think is the designer, but God &ndash; defined in a very nebulous way &ndash; generally out-polls ''extraterrestrials'' as the leading candidate."-->

The criticism of intelligent design has not been limited to the scientific community. Some religious individuals and groups have objected to intelligent design as well, often on theological or moral grounds.<ref><cite>"While the ID crowd have some things of interest to say they, are indeed just a revamped God of the gaps and the Paylean argument from design in a more modern form. Their refusal to engage with the theological issues this engenders is their greatest weakness, it is also a deliberate strategy, to try and show to the secular world they are nothing but scientists and philosophers. It also hides from their Christian constituency that some of their people are not Christian - at least one is a Moonie. Their second weakness is to muddy the waters with terms like "methodological naturalism", "operations science" and "origins science". The fact that some leading Christian philosophers in the US (i.e. Plantiga [sic]) are also confused does not help. Their third weakness is ... their refusal to come clean on the age of the earth. This is to try and hide the fact that they have strong links with the young earthers, at least one of their leading people is a strong young earther. Fourthly, the movement is strongly driven by a US political agenda - the "renewal" of US society and culture through the destruction of materialism via its supposed foundation of "methodological naturalism", the greatest strength of which is supposed to be evolution. The export of this US agenda, redolent with the culture wars, to the rest of the world, is of grave concern."</cite> [http://www.iscast.org.au/pdf/bulletin/Bulletin48.pdf Intelligent Design?] ISCAST Bullentin, Issue 48, Spring 2005. Institute for the Study of Christianity in an Age of Science and Technology. (PDF file)</ref> Many religious people do not condone the teaching of what is considered unscientific or questionable material, and they support [[theistic evolution]] that does not conflict with scientific theories. An example is [[Christoph Cardinal Sch<U+00F6>nborn|Cardinal Sch<U+00F6>nborn]], who sees "purpose and design in the natural world" yet has "no difficulty... with the theory of evolution [within] the borders of scientific theory."

===Defining intelligent design as science===
The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and acquiring new [[knowledge]] of the [[natural world]] without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural, an approach sometimes called [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]]. Intelligent design proponents believe that this can be equated to [[materialism|materialist]] [[metaphysical naturalism]] and have often said that not only is their own position scientific, but it is even more scientific than evolution, and that they want a redefinition of science as a revived [[natural theology]] or [[natural philosophy]] to allow "non-naturalistic theories such as intelligent design."<ref>Stephen C. Meyer, 2005.  [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=1780 The Scientific Status of Intelligent Design: The Methodological Equivalence of Naturalistic and Non-Naturalistic Origins Theories]</ref> This presents a [[demarcation problem]], which in the [[philosophy of science]] is about how and where to draw the lines around science. For a theory to qualify as scientific, it must be:
:* ''Consistent'' (internally and externally)
:* ''Parsimonious'' (sparing in proposed entities or explanations, see [[Occam's Razor]])
:* ''Useful'' (describes, explains and predicts observable phenomena)
:* ''Empirically testable and falsifiable'' (see [[Falsifiability]])
:* ''Based on multiple observations'', often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments
:* ''Correctable and dynamic'' (changes are made as new data are discovered)
:* ''Progressive'' (achieves all that previous theories have and more)
:* ''Provisional'' or tentative (admits that it might not be correct rather than asserting certainty)

For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, but ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. Typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency,<ref>Intelligent design is generally internally consistent and logical only within the framework in which it operates. Criticisms are that this framework has at its foundation an unsupported, unjustified assumption: that complexity and improbability must entail design, but the identity and characteristics of the designer are not identified or quantified, nor need they be. The framework of intelligent design, because it rests on a unquantifiable and unverifiable assertion, has no defined boundaries except that complexity and improbability require design, and the designer need not be constrained by the laws of physics.</ref> violates the principle of parsimony,<ref>Intelligent design fails to pass Occam's razor. Adding  entities (an intelligent agent, a designer) to the equation is not strictly necessary to explain events.</ref> is not falsifiable,<ref>The designer is not falsifiable, since its existence is typically asserted without sufficient conditions to allow a falsifying observation. The designer being beyond the realm of the observable, claims about its existence can be neither supported nor undermined by observation, making intelligent design and the argument from design analytic ''a posteriori'' arguments.</ref> is not empirically testable,<ref>That intelligent design is not empirically testable stems from the fact that it violates a basic premise of science, naturalism.</ref> and is not correctable, dynamic, tentative or progressive.<ref>Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, ''the designer'', intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data.</ref>

In light of its apparent failure to adhere to scientific standards, in September 2005, 38 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]] issued a statement saying "Intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent."<ref>The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Nobel Laureates Initiative. Intelligent design cannot be tested as a scientific theory <cite>"because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent."</cite> [http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf Nobel Laureates Initiative] (PDF file)</ref> And in October 2005 a coalition representing more than 70,000 Australian scientists and science teachers issued a statement saying "intelligent design is not science" and called on "all schools not to teach Intelligent Design (ID) as science, because it fails to qualify on every count as a scientific theory."<ref> Faculty of Science, University of New South Wales. [[20 October]] [[2005]]. [http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/intelligent.html Intelligent Design is not Science - Scientists and teachers speak out]</ref> 

Critics also say that the intelligent design doctrine does not meet the criteria for [[scientific evidence]] used by most courts, the [[Daubert Standard]]. The Daubert Standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in United States federal courts and most state courts.  The four [[Daubert Standard|Daubert criteria]] are:
:* The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified. 
:* The methods should preferably be published in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal. 
:* There should be a known rate of [[error]] that can be used in evaluating the results. 
:* The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.

In deciding ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' on [[December 20]], [[2005]], Judge [[John E. Jones III]] agreed with the plaintiffs, [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|ruling that]] "we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents."

====Peer review====
The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community which withstands scrutiny have weighed against intelligent design's being considered valid science.<ref name=kitzruling_pg87> [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 87 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science]]</ref> To date, the intelligent design movement has yet to have an article published in a peer-reviewed [[scientific journal]].<ref name=kitzruling_pg87/><ref name="aaas_pr"/>

Intelligent design, by appealing to a [[supernatural]] agent, directly conflicts with the [[principle]]s of [[science]], which limit its inquiries to [[empirical]], observable and ultimately [[falsifiable|testable]] [[data]] and which require explanations to be based on empirical [[Scientific method|evidence]]. Dembski, Behe and other intelligent design proponents say bias by the scientific community is to blame for the failure of their research to be published. Intelligent design proponents believe that their writings are rejected for not conforming to purely naturalistic, nonsupernatural mechanisms rather than because their research is not up to "journal standards" and that the merit of their articles is overlooked. Some scientists describe this claim as a [[conspiracy theory]].<ref>John Hawks.  [http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/creation/bush_intelligent_design_2005.html The President and the teaching of evolution]</ref> The issue that the supernatural explanations do not conform to the [[scientific method]] became a sticking point for intelligent design proponents in the 1990s and is addressed in the [[wedge strategy]] as an aspect of science that must be challenged before intelligent design could be accepted by the broader scientific community. 

The debate over whether intelligent design produces new research, as any scientific field must, and has legitimately attempted to publish this research, is extremely heated.  Both critics and advocates point to numerous examples to make their case.  For instance, the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]], a former funder of the Discovery Institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion, says that it asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, but none were ever submitted. Charles L. Harper Jr., foundation vice-president, said: "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review."<ref>Laurie Goodstein. The New York Times. December 4, 2005. [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04good.html?ex=1291352400&en=feb5138e425b9001&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker]</ref> 

The only article published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal that made a case for intelligent design was quickly withdrawn by the publisher for having circumvented the journal's peer-review standards.<ref>[http://www.biolsocwash.org/id_statement.html Statement from the Council of the Biological Society of Washington] regarding publication of a paper by Stephen Meyer</ref>  Written by the Discovery Institute's Center for Science & Culture Director [[Stephen C. Meyer]], it appeared in the peer-reviewed journal ''Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington'' in August 2004.  The article was [[literature review]], which means that it did not present any new research but, rather, culled quotations and claims from other papers to argue that the [[Cambrian explosion]] could not have happened by natural processes.  The choice of venue for this article was also considered problematic, because it was so outside the normal subject matter (see [[Sternberg peer review controversy]]). Dembski has written that <cite>"perhaps the best reason [to be skeptical of his ideas] is that intelligent design has yet to establish itself as a thriving scientific research program."</cite><ref> Dembski. Is Intelligent Design a Form of Natural Theology? [http://www.designinference.com/documents/2001.03.ID_as_nat_theol.htm]</ref> In a 2001 interview, Dembski said that he stopped submitting to peer-reviewed journals because of their slow time-to-print and that he makes more money from publishing books.<ref>Beth McMurtrie. The Chronicle Of Higher Education. 2001. "[http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i17/17a00801.htm Darwinism Under Attack]</ref> 

In the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Dover trial]], the judge found that intelligent design features no scientific research or testing.<ref name=kitzruling_pg88>[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 88 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science]]</ref> There, intelligent design proponents cited just one paper, on simulation modeling of evolution by Behe and Snoke, which mentioned neither irreducible complexity nor intelligent design and which Behe admitted did not rule out known evolutionary mechanisms.<ref name=kitzruling_pg88/> But in sworn testimony, Behe said: "There are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred."<ref>[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', [[October 19]] [[2005]], AM session [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am.html Kitzmiller Testimony, Behe]</ref> As summarized by the judge, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed articles supporting his claims of intelligent design or irreducible complexity. In his ruling, the judge wrote: "A final indicator of how ID has failed to demonstrate scientific warrant is the complete absence of peer-reviewed publications supporting the theory."<ref name=kitzruling_pg87/> 
 
Despite this, the Discovery Institute continues to insist that a number of intelligent design articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals,<ref>Discovery Institute. [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2640&program=CSC%20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20Science Peer-Reviewed, Peer-Edited, and other Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated)]</ref> including in their list the two articles mentioned above. Critics, largely members of the scientific community, reject this claim, pointing out that no established scientific journal has yet published an intelligent design article. Instead, intelligent design proponents have set up their own journals with "peer review" which lack [[impartiality]] and [[rigour|rigor]],<ref><cite>"With some of the claims for peer review, notably Campbell and Meyer (2003) and the e-journal PCID, the reviewers are themselves ardent supporters of intelligent design. The purpose of peer review is to expose errors, weaknesses, and significant omissions in fact and argument. That purpose is not served if the reviewers are uncritical."</cite> [http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI001_4.html Index to Creationist Claims] Mark Isaak, TalkOrigins archive 2006 </ref> consisting entirely of intelligent design supporters.<ref><cite>"ID leaders know the benefits of submitting their work to independent review and have established at least two purportedly "peer-reviewed" journals for ID articles. However, one has languished for want of material and quietly ceased publication, while the other has a more overtly philosophical orientation. Both journals employ a weak standard of "peer review" that amounts to no more than vetting by the editorial board or society fellows."</cite> [http://law.wustl.edu/WULQ/83-1/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf Is It Science Yet?: Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution] Matthew J. Brauer, [[Barbara Forrest]], and Steven G. Gey (PDF file)</ref>

===Intelligence as an observable quality===
The phrase ''intelligent'' design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], a concept that has no [[scientific consensus]] definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that "Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature." The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be [[observation|observable]] without specifying what the criteria for the [[measurement]] of intelligence should be. Dembski, instead, asserts that "in special sciences ranging from [[forensics]] to [[archaeology]] to [[SETI]] (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable."<ref>Dembski.  Natural History magazine. April 2002. [http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/nhmag.html Intelligent Design?]</ref> How this appeal is made and what this implies as to the definition of intelligence are topics left largely unaddressed. [[Seth Shostak]], a researcher with the [[SETI Institute]], refuted Dembski's comparison of SETI and intelligent design, saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference of design on complexity &mdash; the argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes &mdash; while SETI researchers are looking primarily for [[artificial|artificiality]].<ref>Shostak. space.com <cite>"In fact, the signals actually sought by today<U+2019>s SETI searches are not complex, as the ID advocates assume. ... If SETI were to announce that we<U+2019>re not alone because it had detected a signal, it would be on the basis of artificiality."</cite> [http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_intelligentdesign_051201.html SETI and Intelligent Design] Seth Shostak. SETI Institute, December 2005.</ref>

Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science.  Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<ref>"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies. -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 81 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 81]]</ref>

As a means of criticism, certain [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]] have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of [[artificial intelligence]]. The criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent, specifically that "no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent, that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes."<ref>Taner Edis. Skeptical Inquirer Magazine, March/April 2001 issue. [http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-03/intelligent-design.html Darwin in Mind: Intelligent Design Meets Artificial Intelligence]</ref> This claim is similar in type to an assumption of [[Cartesian dualism]] that posits a strict separation between "mind" and the material universe. However, in studies of artificial intelligence, while there is an implicit assumption that supposed "intelligence" or [[creativity]] of a [[computer program]] is determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer [[programmer]], artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules. Rather, if a computer program can access [[randomness]] as a function, this effectively allows for a flexible, creative, and adaptive intelligence. [[Evolutionary algorithms]], a subfield of machine learning (itself a subfield of artificial intelligence), have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to "evolve" complex, highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer. Evolutionary algorithms use the Darwinian metaphor of random mutation, selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods. Furthermore, forays into such areas as [[quantum computing]] seem to indicate that real probabilistic functions may be available in the future. Intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the "innate" intelligence associated with biological organisms, and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception that intelligence itself necessarily requires a designer. [[Cognitive science]] continues to investigate the nature of intelligence to that end, but the intelligent design community for the most part seems to be content to rely on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems.

===Arguments from ignorance===
[[Eugenie Scott]], along with [[Glenn Branch]] and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are [[Argument from ignorance|arguments from ignorance]].<ref name="2002-09-10">Eugenie C. Scott and Glenn Branch. National Center for Science Education. [[September 10]] [[2002]]. [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/996_intelligent_design_not_accep_9_10_2002.asp "Intelligent Design" Not Accepted by Most Scientists]</ref> In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies upon a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause.  They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that "we don't know yet" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside of science.<ref name="2002-09-10"/> Particularly, [[Michael Behe]]'s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a [[dichotomy]] where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. In scientific terms, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" for naturalistic explanations of observed traits of living [[organism]]s.  Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.

Intelligent design has also been characterized as a "[[god of the gaps]]" argument, which has the following form:
:*There is a gap in scientific knowledge.
:*The gap is filled with acts of God (or [[Intelligent designer]]) and therefore proves the existence of God (or [[Intelligent designer]]). 

A [[God of the Gaps|god of the gaps]] argument is the [[theological]] version of an [[argument from ignorance]].  The key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations (often [[supernatural]]) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions. 

====Improbable versus impossible events====
[[William Dembski]] formulated the [[universal probability bound]], a reformulation of the creationist ''argument from improbability'',<ref> Jason Rosenhouse, (2001). ''[http://www.math.jmu.edu/~rosenhjd/sewell.pdf How Anti-Evolutionists Abuse Mathematics]'' The Mathematical Intelligencer, Vol. 23, No. 4, Fall 2001, pp. 3-8.</ref> which he argues is the smallest probability of anything occurring in the universe over all time at the maximum possible rate. This value, 1 in 10<sup>120</sup>, represents a revision of his original formula, which set the value of the universal probability bound at 1 in 10<sup>150</sup>.<ref>William A. Dembski (2004). ''[[The Design Revolution|The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design]]''</ref>  In 2005 Dembski again revised his definition to be the inverse of the product of two different quantities, 10<sup>120</sup> and the variable rank complexity of the event under consideration.<ref> The rank complexity is Dembski's &phi; function, which ranks patterns in order of their [[Kolmogorov complexity|descriptive complexity]]. See [[specified complexity]].</ref>

In "Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences," [[John Allen Paulos]] states that the apparent [[probability|improbability]] of a given scenario cannot necessarily be taken as an indication that this scenario is more unlikely than any other potential one: "Rarity by itself shouldn't necessarily be evidence of anything.  When one is dealt a [[bridge (card game)|bridge]] hand of thirteen cards, the probability of being dealt that particular hand is less than one in 600 billion [1 in 6 x 10<sup>11</sup>].  Still, it would be absurd for someone to be dealt a hand, examine it carefully, calculate that the probability of getting it is less than one in 600 billion, and then conclude that he must not have been [randomly] dealt that very hand because it is so very improbable."
