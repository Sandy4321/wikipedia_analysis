The '''1892 Alabama Cadets football team''' represented the [[University of Alabama]] in the [[1892 college football season]]. The team was led by head coach [[E. B. Beaumont]] and played their home games at [[List of Alabama Crimson Tide home football stadiums#Lakeview_Park|Lakeview Park]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. In what was the inaugural season of Alabama football, the team finished with a record of two wins and two losses (2<U+2013>2).

William G. Little of [[Livingston, Alabama]] is credited with being responsible for the introduction of football at the university. After playing the game in 1891 while in attendance at a northern [[University-preparatory school|prep school]], Little returned to Alabama where he helped establish the first team at the university for the 1892 season. The first game in Alabama football history was played on November 11, 1892, against Birmingham High School and was won by the Cadets 56<U+2013>0. They then split a pair of games with the Birmingham Athletic Club, and closed out the season with a 32<U+2013>22 loss in the first [[Iron Bowl]] against [[1893 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] on February 22, 1893. After the season, Beaumont was fired as head coach and replaced by [[Eli Abbott]] for the [[1893 Alabama Crimson White football team|1893 season]].
