'''Copeland Creek''' is a [[perennial]] [[stream]] that rises on [[Sonoma Mountain]] in [[Sonoma County, California]].<ref>''Santa Rosa Quadrangle'', Fifteen minute series, [[USGS]] Quadrangle Map, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington DC (1958)</ref>  The headwaters area is slightly above the [[Fairfield Osborn Preserve]], while the middle reaches drain [[grazing]] land and vineyards on the lower western slopes of the [[Sonoma Mountains]].  Upon reaching the valley floor Copeland Creek bisects the campus of [[Sonoma State University]] on its journey to discharge into the [[Laguna de Santa Rosa]].  The Copeland Creek watershed is part of the [[Russian River]] basin, which drains to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==History==
The prehistory of this watershed and creek environment includes settlement by [[Coast Miwok]], [[Wappo]] and [[Pomo people]]s.  These [[hunter gatherer]]s dominated human usage until arrival of [[Europe]]ans in the early 1800s.  Rather swiftly an [[overgrazing]] situation arose not only in the lower reaches, but as high as the present [[Fairfield Osborn Preserve]], which extends to elevation 1700 feet.  The upper reaches of the creek were effectively restored, following the purchase of the present lands of the Fairfield Osborn Preserve by [[William Matson Roth]]. 

The lower reaches were heavily disturbed as late as the 1990s, when a restoration of the reach between Roberts Road and Petaluma Hill Road was started.  These lower reaches would have been historically heavily [[vegetation|vegetated]] by native [[alder]] and arroyo [[willow]].<ref>David Cook and Jessica Martini-Lamb, ''Copeland Creek Restoration Project Monitoring Plan'',Sonoma County Water Agency, April, 2001</ref>  However, cattle grazing and associated trampling of [[vegetation]] severely reduced spawning of [[anadromous]] fish: by altering stream cover that cooled water temperatures and by elevating [[turbidity]], with resulting covering of spawning [[gravel]]s.  Some lower reaches between Roberts Road and the Fairfield Osborn Preserve are still subject to overgrazing as of 2006.  Overgrazing has also exacerbated stream bank [[erosion]], and led to invasive [[forb]]s and grasses supplanting the native [[riparian]] vegetation.  This alteration of native riparian growth has further reduced populations of [[avafauna]], [[amphibian]]s and macro [[invertebrate]]s.

==Ecology==
Principal plant communities within the upper reaches include the dominant [[California oak woodland]], and also consist of  [[douglas-fir]] [[woodland]] and [[riparian forest|riparian woodland]].  Within the oak woodland the main tree species are [[Coast live oak]], [[Oregon oak]], [[California black oak]], [[Canyon live oak]] and [[California bay laurel]].  The woodland [[understory]] exhibits [[toyon]], [[coffeeberry]], [[poison oak]] and numerous other flowering plants such as [[snowberry]] and the uncommon [[American Ginseng]].

==Management==
Oversight of Copeland Creek is by the [[Sonoma County Water Agency]]; in the year 2006 the Agency cleared [[cattail]]s and [[arroyo willow]] from certain lower reach portions of the creek in order to improve flow characteristics.<ref>[http://www.scwa.ca.gov/_pdf/stream_maintenance_2006_update.pdf Sonoma County Water Agency 2006 Maintenance Plan]]</ref>  As with any flood control management strategy, unintended environmental impacts can arise from stream channel modification.  The Sonoma County General Plan Open Space Element calls for a Copeland Creek Trail along Copeland Creek to connect Rohnert Park near Sonoma State University to Crane Creek Regional Park.<ref>[http://www.sonomatrails.org/docs/genplan.htm Excerpts from Sonoma County General Plan pertaining to Copeland Creek]</ref>  In addition the 2003 County Outdoor Recreation Plan calls for a Copeland Creek Regional Park of about 500 acres to be situated near [[Fairfield Osborn Preserve]] at elevation 1500 feet.<ref>[http://www.sonomatrails.org/docs/genplan.htm Sonoma County Outdoor Recreation Plan Park Summary]</ref>

The Sonoma County Water Agency in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Game have developed a strategy for enhancing [[spawning]] capability to the [[Russian River]] and a number of its tributaries; this activity was directed at the benefit of three [[threatened]] [[anadromous]] [[species]]: [[Coho salmon]], [[Chinook salmon]] and [[steelhead]].  A Copeland Creek Restoration Project addressed the creek channel along approximately 6000 lineal feet of Copeland Creek, which had been [[overgrazing|overgrazed]] by [[cattle]] for over 100 years.<ref>[http://www.scwa.ca.gov/environment/natural_resources/fisheries_enhancement.php Copeland Creek Fisheries Enhancement Program]</ref> Commencing in 1999, the project was implemented in four phases, the fourth and final phase of construction having been completed in the autumn of 2003. The project was designed to stabilize banks, decrease creek [[turbidity]], exclude cattle from the creek by fencing, and improve habitat for steelhead and other native [[fish]] and [[wildlife]].  The outcome yielded a creek with less sediment load and a more natural undulation of channel, where an almost linear creek geometry had existed for the previously modified  reach.
