'''Group-specific antigen''' (Gag) is the genetic material that codes for the core structural proteins of a [[retrovirus]].

It comprises part of the [[gag-onc fusion protein]].

==Gag in HIV==

Gag proteins are encoded by the ''gag'' gene, and provide structural elements of the virus.

===p24===
p24 makes up the viral capsid.

When a [[Western blot]] test is used to detect HIV infection, p24 is one of the three major proteins tested for, along with [[#gp120|gp120]]/gp160 and [[#gp41|gp41]].

===p6, p7, and p17===
p6 and p7 provide the nucleocapsid.

p17 provides a protective matrix (a protein that forms a scaffold during virion assembly).
