The '''River Ouse''' is a [[river]] in the [[county]] of [[West Sussex|West]] and [[East Sussex]] in [[England]]. It rises near [[Lower Beeding]], passes through [[Lewes]] and the [[South Downs]] and joins the [[English Channel]] at [[Newhaven, East Sussex]].

Unlike the other British rivers called the [[Ouse]], whose name comes from a Scandinavian root cognate with "oose", its name may come from a corruption of the [[French language|French]] "Rivi<U+00E8>re de Lewes"{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. The river was originally known as the River Mid-wynd.

The author [[Virginia Woolf]] drowned herself in the River Ouse on March 28, 1941, near the village of [[Rodmell]]. 

==Ouse Navigation==
[[Image:Cliffe Cut.jpg|thumb|This straightened tidal stretch of the River Ouse just south of Lewes is called Cliffe Cut. It was made when the Ouse was canalised in the late 1790s. The original course of the river meandered in the foreground.]]
In 1787, [[William Jessop]] was asked to survey the river with a view to extending navigation right up to [[Slaugham]]. Three years later the Upper Ouse Navigation Act was passed, enabling construction upon the navigation to begin. However, the initial estimates of cost were soon exceeded, and work slowed. Eventually, about 1812, the [[canalisation]] of the Ouse was completed, and the river was navigable from Lewes up to [[Balcombe, West Sussex]], the navigable part of the river terminating at '''Upper Ryelands Bridge'''. The navigation totalled 22 miles in length, plus a 3/4 mile branch to [[Shortbridge]], and featured 19 [[canal lock|locks]].<ref>{{cite web | title=River Ouse Navigation, Sussex | work= | url=http://www.sussex.co.uk/waterways/ouse.htm | accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>

Trade along the Ouse Navigation consisted mostly of lime, chalk, manure, aggregates and coal. Whilst in 1801 there were 51 barges registered as trading on the river (21 of which worked the river above Lewes), the navigation was never a huge commercial success. During the 1840s, as railways proved to be a cheaper and faster method of transporting goods, attempts were made to attract more trade by reducing tolls, but this had little effect and by 1868 all trade above Lewes had ceased, although boats continued working on the Lower Ouse to Lewes right up to the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web | title=History of the Sussex Ouse Navigation | work=The Sussex Ouse Restoration Trust | url=http://sxouse.users.btopenworld.com/history.htm | accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>

Today, the remains of most of the old locks are still visible, although all are now slowly deteriorating. The Sussex Ouse Restoration Trust is promoting renovating the navigation .<ref>{{cite web | title=Future Plans | work=The Sussex Ouse Restoration Trust | url=http://sxouse.users.btopenworld.com/future.htm | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

[[Southease]] [[swing bridge]] was built in the 1880s, is the second bridge on the site and though the swing mechanism remains, it has not been opened since [[1967]]<ref name=southease-bridge-and-railway>[http://www.snowing.co.uk/sias/articles/main_9.htm Sussex Industrial Archaeology Society page with information on Southease Bridge and railway]</ref>.

==Ecology and wildlife==
There is at present a lot of research into the presence and effects of organic and inorganic pollutants in the Sussex Ouse. The nature of the river is that sediment in high-flow areas is absent, with the exception of the Denton Island area. In 2001 the river flooded, placing areas of the river towns [[Lewes]] and [[Uckfield]] under water.

The river is known for the unusually large [[Brown trout|Sea Trout]] that migrate up the river twice a year to spawn. The river also contains large [[Northern pike|Pike]] (up to 30&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pound]]s) and more recently large [[Carp]]. Other species include [[Barbel (fish species)|Barbel]], [[Roach (fish)|Roach]], [[Common dace|Dace]], [[Rudd]], [[Minnow]], [[European perch|Perch]], [[European chub|Chub]], [[Pumpkinseed]] and [[Tench]]. The tidal stretches also contain [[Mullet (fish)]] and near the mouth, [[Moronidae|Bass]].

Today the Ouse is managed by the Environment Agency and is utilised as a source of drinking water and as a conduit for treated sewage as well as providing drainage for the surrounding area. It has reverted to its tidal state up to Barcombe Mills and its banks have been raised in an attempt to stop flooding. From Barcombe Mills to the sea the river has long posed a problem with flooding, as was so forcefully demonstrated in 1960, and more recently in October 2000.

==Culture==
The Ouse Summer Raft Race is held annually, and organised by the Lewes & District Round Table. Competitors construct their own rafts and paddle down the river, from [[Lewes]] to [[Newhaven]]. At Lewes and [[Southease]], the rafters are pelted by crowds on the bridge and riverbank with [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[flour]], [[seaweed]], and [[water]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Raft Race| work=Lewes & District Round Table website | url=http://www.lewesroundtable.co.uk/ | accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>
