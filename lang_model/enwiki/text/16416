"'''Between You and Me'''"{{#tag:ref|Some official releases, such as the single cover, label the song "Just Between You and Me".<ref name="liner1"/><ref name="liner2"/>|group="nb"}} is a song by the American [[contemporary Christian music]] group [[DC Talk (band)|DC Talk]]. Released in 1996, it was the second [[radio single|radio]] and [[Single (music)|commercial single]] released from the group's fourth album, ''[[Jesus Freak (album)|Jesus Freak]]''.

Lyrically, <U+201C>Between You and Me<U+201D> stresses the importance of seeking forgiveness from a friend. In contrast to many of the DC Talk's other singles, the [[Christian]] message of "Between You and Me" <U+2013> the importance of forgiveness and confession <U+2013> is heavily implied, although it is not blatantly stated in terms of any specific religion. The music video for the song features the band members <U+2013> [[Michael Tait]], [[Kevin Max]], and [[Toby McKeehan]] <U+2013> performing the song in a laundromat. Interspersed is footage of a man carrying a package while running from two other men.

After the unexpected success of the grunge rock single "[[Jesus Freak (song)|Jesus Freak]]," "Between You and Me" helped to bring DC Talk to a new level of success and solidify them as mainstream artists. The song later earned DC Talk a [[GMA Dove Award]] and is the only DC Talk single to have charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The single was also a Christian radio success and peaked at number one on both the [[Christian adult contemporary|Christian Adult Contemporary]] and [[Christian CHR|Christian Contemporary Hit Radio]] ''[[CCM Magazine]]'' charts.

In contrast to many of the DC Talk's other singles, the [[Christian]] message of "Between You and Me" <U+2013> the importance of forgiveness and confession <U+2013> is heavily implied, although it is not blatantly stated in terms of any specific religion. The only mention of God is featured during the breakdown of the song, which is absent in the radio edit.<ref name="refdctalk"/> This removal of God from the song caused some fans of the band to wonder if the group's record label made a "conscious effort to remove any overt Christian content from the song."<ref>[[#Howard|Howard and Streck (2004)]], p. 193</ref>

"Between You and Me" is built around acoustic strumming and synthesized drums, courtesy of Scott Williamson.<ref name="liner"/><ref name=billreview/> The song begins with acoustic strumming in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G major]].<ref name="refdctalk">[[#refdctalk|DC Talk (2001)]], p. 29.</ref><ref name=billreview/> The song then moves into the key of [[E major]] during the verses. "Between You and Me" features a chorus that is in the key of G major; in addition, the chorus is composed of "boyish lead vocals", "sweet harmonies", and "whirling organs".<ref name="refdctalk"/><ref name=billreview/> During the verses, [[Michael Tait]], [[Kevin Max]], and [[Toby McKeehan]] take turns singing lead. The second chorus is followed by a melodic breakdown featuring minimalistic guitar and whispered vocals. The song then repeats the line "It's my way to freedom" and "I've got something to say" until the end.<ref name="refdctalk">[[#refdctalk|DC Talk (2001)]], p. 37.</ref>

==Music video==

The music video for the song features Michael Tait, Kevin Max, and Toby McKeehan performing the song in a laundromat. Interspersed is footage of a man carrying a package while running from two other men. Near the end, he runs into the laundromat where DC Talk are singing and deposits the box in a trash can before leaving. Tait, Max, and McKeehan then reach into the trash can to investigate the contents of the box. Just as the box is opened, the video ends.<ref>{{cite video | people=DC Talk | title=Between You and Me | medium=Music Video| publisher=[[Forefront Records]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kXJdshVNq0}}</ref>

The video for "Between You and Me" received regular airtime on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music">[[#McNeil|McNeil (2005)]], pg. 99</ref> While the video was popular, however, the band found it more and more difficult to get airplay on MTV for what they perceived as a bias against the Christian music scene. McKeehan explained that with "Between You and Me", the group was able to "sneak one past the goalie", but afterwards the DJs realized that "this group's from the Christian market".<ref>[[#Alfonso|Alfonso (2002)]], p. 70</ref>

The song was released as a the second [[single (music)|single]] for ''[[Jesus Freak (album)|Jesus Freak]]'' in 1996. Due to its wide appeal, however, the song was extensively played on many non-Christian stations, leading the single to become a major crossover hit. The song's surprising rise on the Billboard's charts was a result of the partnership with [[Virgin Records]]. Phil Quartararo, then-CEO of Virgin Records said that "Between You and Me" was "identified early in the game as a very radio-friendly cut."<ref name="billboard2"/> In addition to "Jesus Freak" and "[[Colored People (song)|Colored People]]," "Between You and Me" was considered instrumental in breaking DC Talk into the mainstream.<ref name="billboard3">{{Cite news   | title = Jars and Butteflies: The Joys of Mainstreaming  | newspaper = Billboard  | pages = 38<U+2013>40  | date = April 25, 1998  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=aQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38&dq=dc+talk+Between+You+and+Me+Billboard&hl=en&ei=ojdHTL7FH4eonQem-9D2Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=dc%20talk%20Between%20You%20and%20Me%20Billboard&f=false  | accessdate = July 21, 2010}}</ref>

Jay R. Howard and John M. Streck, in their book ''Apostles of Rock: The Splintered World of Contemporary Christian Music'', called it "a significant validation of the music".<ref>[[#Howard|Howard and Streck (2004)]], p. 200</ref>

Critically, the song was also a success. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine gave the single an extremely positive review and noted that the song and band were helping to shatter the myth that "Christian pop has to be heavy-handedd or steeping power-ballad syrup".<ref name=billreview/> The magazine also praised the song for "lyrics [that] remain subtle but forthright in the song's positive message".<ref name=billreview>{{cite journal|last=Flick|first=Larry|title=Reviews and Previews|journal=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=September 28, 1996|volume=108|issue=39|page=108|accessdate=October 14, 2012}}</ref> Michael Mehle of the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' positively noted that the song possessed "[[Seal (musician)|Seal]]-like R&B" qualities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mehle|first=Michael|title=Christian Band Between Rock and a Hard Place|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67777803.html|accessdate=October 14, 2012|publisher=[[E.
