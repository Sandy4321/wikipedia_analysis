He is currently the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the United Kingdom, a role he was appointed to in May 2010, and has been the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] since 2001.

Osborne is part of the old [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocracy, known in [[Ireland]] as the ''[[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]]''. He is the heir to the [[Osborne Baronets|Osborne baronetcy]] (of Ballentaylor, in [[County Tipperary]], and Ballylemon, in [[County Waterford]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/10/04/george-and-the-hoares-115875-21720824/ |title=George Osbourne and the Hoares: Top Tory who wants to look after our money puts his in haven for super-rich|publisher=The Mirror|accessdate=6 October 2009|date=4 October 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/related-10117-17013-george-osborne-william-hague.do |title=George Osborne and William Hague |newspaper=Evening Standard |accessdate=10 May 2010 }}</ref>

He was educated at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], before becoming a Conservative researcher, and then an MP.

==Early life and family==
Osborne is the eldest son of four children. His father, [[Sir Peter Osborne, 17th Baronet]], [[Entrepreneur|co-founded]] the [[firm]] of [[fabric]] and [[wallpaper]]s [[designer]]s [[Osborne & Little]].<ref name=Mail_17_02_10>{{Citation | last = Tozer | first = James | title = George Osborne's doctor brother 'prescribed drug to cocaine-addict prostitute who wasn't his patient' | newspaper = The Daily Mail | date = 17 February 2010 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251406/George-Osbornes-doctor-brother-prescribed-Pill-Muslim-girlfriend-telling-GP.html | accessdate = 19 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=Guardian_08_10_09>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gallery/2009/oct/08/conservatives-toryconference-top-10?picture=353948131|title=Britain's Top 10 Tories|date=8 October 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=23 February 2010 | location=London | first1=Michael | last1=White | first2=Nick | last2=Boles}}</ref> His mother is Felicity Alexandra Loxton-Peacock, the daughter of artist Lady Clarisse Loxton Peacock.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Charles Mosley 2003">Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 2, page 1989.</ref>

Originally named Gideon Oliver,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> he changed his name to George when he was 13. In an interview in July 2005, Osborne said: "It was my small act of rebellion. I never liked it. When I finally told my mother she said, 'Nor do I'. So I decided to be George after my grandfather, who was a war hero. Life was easier as a George; it was a straightforward name."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1494588/The-future-belongs-to-us-predicts-Tory-partys-young-star.html |title=The future belongs to us, predicts Tory party's young star |author=Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson |date=22 July 2005 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |newspaper=The Telegraph | location=London}}</ref>

==Education==
Osborne was educated at two [[independent school]]s in west London: at [[Norland Place School]] in [[Holland Park]] and [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] (near [[Hammersmith]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23583566-st-pauls-school-in-150m-rebuild.do |title=St Paul's School in <U+00A3>150m rebuild |newspaper=Evening Standard |first=Tim |last=Ross |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=10 January 2010 }}</ref> followed by a [[Bachelor's degree]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]]<ref name="ReferenceA"/> where he received a [[2:1]] in [[Modern History]].<ref name=Guardian_08_10_09/> At Oxford he edited the university's [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]],<ref name="dm-bullingdon">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-447223/Oxford-1992-Portrait-classless-Tory.html |title=Oxford 1992: Portrait of a 'classless' Tory |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2008 | location=London}}</ref> and was a member of the [[Bullingdon Club]].<ref name="dm-bullingdon"/> He also attended [[Davidson College]] in [[North Carolina]] for a semester as a [[Dean Rusk]] Scholar.<ref>http://daybook.davidson.edu/?p=1634</ref>

==Working==
Osborne's first job was to provide data entry services to the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] to record the names of people who had died in London.<ref name="The George Osborne Supremacy">{{cite news |title=The George Osborne Supremacy |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=21 September 2008 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/moslive/article-1056606/Its-wife-arranges-mortgage-admits-George-Osborne--Chancellor-waiting.html |accessdate=21 September 2008 | location=London | first=Jon | last=Wilde}}</ref> He also briefly worked for [[Selfridges]]. He originally intended to pursue a career in journalism, but instead got a job at [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Conservative Central Office]].<ref name="The George Osborne Supremacy"/>

==Political career==
He joined the [[Conservative Research Department]] in 1994 and became head of the Political Section. Between 1995 and 1997 he worked for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as special advisor to minister [[Douglas Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]] (during the BSE crisis) and worked in the Political Office at 10 Downing Street.  Between 1997 and 2001, he worked for then Conservative leader [[William Hague]] as a speech writer and Political Secretary. In this role he helped prepare Hague for the weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions, often playing the role of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]. Under the successive leaderships of [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]] he remained on the Prime Minister's Questions team.

===Member of Parliament===
Elected as the Member of Parliament for [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]], Cheshire, in June 2001, he succeeded the [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] MP [[Martin Bell]], who had famously defeated the controversial former Conservative minister [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 election]].  Osborne won with a majority of 8,611, becoming (at that time) the youngest Conservative MP in the House of Commons. At the 2005 election, he was re-elected with an increased majority of 11,731 (51.8% of the vote) and in 2010 increased his majority still further to 14,487.

===Shadow Cabinet===
[[File:GeorgeOsborne.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Osborne speaking at a podium, gesturing with his hands.|George Osborne at Conservative Spring Forum 2006 in Manchester.]]

In September 2004, Osborne was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as Shadow [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]].

Following the 2005 general election, he was promoted to [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the young age of 33 by the then-[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Michael Howard]]. His appointment to such a senior shadow cabinet post at such a young age surprised many Conservative MPs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Howard had in fact initially offered the post to [[William Hague]], who turned it down. Press reports suggest that Howard's second choice for the post was in fact [[David Cameron]], who also rejected the job as he preferred to take on a major public service portfolio (he was made Shadow Education Secretary). Thus Howard turned to Osborne as his third choice for the role.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hague rejects post of shadow chancellor |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 May 2005 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/may/12/conservatives.whitehall |accessdate=4 May 2008 | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | location=London}}</ref> His promotion prompted speculation he would run for leadership of the Conservative Party when Howard stepped down, but he ruled himself out within a week.<ref name="Leader">{{cite news |title=Osborne will not enter Tory race |publisher=BBC News |date=20 May 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4564605.stm |accessdate=22 April 2007 }}</ref> Osborne served as campaign manager for David Cameron's leadership campaign, and kept the Shadow Chancellor's post when Cameron became leader later that year.

Osborne's close friendship with Cameron has led to comparisons with the relationship between [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the mid-1990s. Responding to this comparison at the LSE in February 2006, Osborne said that there had been "no deal" between him and Cameron and he has repeatedly denied ambitions beyond the Chancellorship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Asked whether or not he would be willing to sack a close colleague such as Osborne, Cameron stated, "With George, the answer is yes. He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are [[Godparent|godfathers]] to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23765406-david-cameron-would-i-sack-george-osborne-yes-absolutely-if-i-have-to.do |title=David Cameron: Would I sack George Osborne? Yes absolutely if I have to... |first=Geordie |last=Greig |date=6 November 2009 |newspaper=Evening Standard |accessdate=6 November 2009 }}</ref>

Osborne has expressed an interest in the ideas of "tax simplification" (including the idea of [[flat tax]]). He set up a "Tax Reform Commission" in October 2005 to investigate ideas for how to create a "flatter, simpler" tax system. The system then proposed would reduce the income tax rate to a flat 22%, and increase personal allowance from <U+00A3>4,435 to <U+00A3>10,000-<U+00A3>15,500. The idea of a flat tax is not included in the current Conservative party manifesto.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4325866.stm |title=Flat tax inventor turns critic |date=10 October 2005 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 April 2010 | first=Steve | last=Schifferes}}</ref>

Each year between 2006 and 2009, Osborne attended the annual [[Bilderberg Conference]], a meeting of influential people in business, finance and politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/regmem/?p=11145 |title=Register of Members' Interests <U+2013> George Osborne |publisher=TheyWorkForYou |accessdate=16 April 2010 }}</ref>

====Comments on Gordon Brown====
During Osborne's response to the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Gordon Brown]]'s ''Pre-Budget Report'' on 5 December 2005, Osborne accused Brown of being "a Chancellor past his sell by date, a Chancellor holding Britain back". In an interview the same week, he also referred to Brown as 'brutal' and 'unpleasant'.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=unpleasant+and+brutal+and+brown+and+osborne+&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&location=http%3A//news.ft.com/cms/s/3dbad21e-6378-11da-be11-0000779e2340.html |title=Shadow chancellor attacks 'brutal' Brown |author=Cathy Newman |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=2 December 2005 |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> In October 2006 Osborne was rebuked by the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] when he attacked the Chancellor at Oral Questions to the Chancellor by citing a comment attributed to the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]], describing the Chancellor as likely to make an 'effing awful' Prime Minister.<ref name="Hansard20061026">{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0001.htm#06102646000012 |title=Treasury questions |author= |work=[[Hansard]] |date=26 October 2006 : Column 1637 |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> It was widely suggested that Osborne was leading an assault on Brown which would allow the Conservatives to discredit him without damaging David Cameron's public image.<ref name="Hansard20061026" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/derek_draper/2006/08/camerons_boot_boys.html |title=Cameron's boot boys |author=[[Derek Draper]] |work=Guardian Unlimited |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=19 November 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article745905.ece |title=New era will begin with attack on Brown's record |author=Philip Webster |work=[[The Times]] |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=19 November 2007 | location=London}}</ref>  Osborne faced criticism from some quarters for appearing to suggest that Brown was "faintly autistic". After talking about his ability to recall odd facts in an interview, a host suggested that Osborne may have been "faintly autistic"; Osborne responded by saying that "We're not getting onto Gordon Brown yet".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5399072.stm |title=Osborne's Autism Jibe Criticised |author= |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref>

===="Run on the pound"====
On 14 November 2008, in an intervention described by the BBC's [[Nick Robinson]] as "pretty extraordinary",<ref name="Sterling">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7730803.stm |title=Osborne fears sterling collapse |date=15 November 2008 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}</ref> Osborne spoke out warning that the more the government borrows the less attractive [[Pound sterling|sterling]] becomes. He said: "We are in danger, if the government is not careful, of having a proper sterling collapse, a run on the pound." Labelling Gordon Brown's tactic as a "scorched-earth policy", which a future Conservative government would have to clear up, Osborne continued: "His view is he probably won't win the next election. The Tories can clear this mess up after I've gone."<ref name="Sterling"/> [[Stanley Kalms|Lord Kalms]], a prominent supporter of [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] in the 2005 leadership election, told the [[BBC News|BBC]] that former shadow home secretary David Davis would be more appropriate as shadow chancellor.<ref name="Sterling"/>

===The Deripaska claim===
In October 2008, Osborne's school and university friend the financier [[Nathaniel Philip Rothschild|Nathaniel Rothschild]] claimed that George Osborne had tried to solicit a <U+00A3>50,000 donation from the Russian aluminium magnate [[Oleg Deripaska]], which would have been a violation of the law against political donations by foreign citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-the-flawed-judgement-of-a-shadow-chancellor-968549.html  |title=Leading article: The flawed judgement of a shadow Chancellor |date=22 October 2008 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=23 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=Times2008-10-23 /> Deripaska, whose wealth amounted to $3.5bn in 2009,<ref>http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Oleg-Deripaska_UCP9.html</ref> hosted Osborne, Rothschild and [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Peter Mandelson]] on his yacht in Corfu in the summer of 2008, where the allegations took place. The [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] received a formal complaint initiated in a letter by the [[Liberal Democrats]]' Home Affairs Spokesman, [[Chris Huhne]], requesting them to investigate the claims against Osborne. The Commission rejected the claims and said it saw "no information" suggesting an offence.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7686789.stm  Huhne donor probe call rejected] BBC News, 23 October 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Corfu-Row-Lib-Dem-Chris-Huhne-Calls-For-Investigation-of-George-Osborne/Article/200810415126884?lpos=Politics_Carousel_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_15126884_Corfu_Row%3A_Lib_Dem_Chris_Huhne_Calls_For_Investigation_of_George_Osborne  Huhne calls for Investigation of George Osborne] [[Sky News]], 23 October 2008</ref> The story was coined by the press as 'Yachtgate.'<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/matthewd_ancona/3563042/Doesnt-Yachtgate-give-you-that-sinking-feeling.html|title=Doesn't 'Yachtgate' give you that sinking feeling?|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 26, 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2010|location=London|first=Matthew|last=d'Ancona}}</ref>

===Expenses===
In 2009, he received criticism for the way he had handled his expenses, after he was found to have "flipped" his second home,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6474725.ece|title=George Osborne 'flipped' second home to claim for <U+00A3>450,000 loan|accessdate=11 June 2009 | work=The Times | first=David | last=Brown | date=11 June 2009 | location=London}}</ref> changing which property he designated as his second home in order to pay less capital gains tax. The Lib Dems estimated he owed <U+00A3>55,000 to the public purse as a result of this.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5526823/MPs-expenses-George-Osborne-must-be-made-to-pay-say-Lib-Dems.html|title='MPs' expenses: George Osborne 'must be made to pay' say Lib Dems'|accessdate=13 June 2009 | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Melissa | last1=Kite | date=13 June 2009 | location=London}}</ref> He had previously paid back <U+00A3>1,193 on overpayments on his mortgage and chauffeur fares<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5581534/MPs-expenses-The-table-of-paybacks.html|title='MPs' expenses: The table of paybacks'|accessdate=18 June 2009 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}</ref> after a complaint from a Labour activist, and it also emerged that he had claimed <U+00A3>47 for two copies of a DVD of his own speech on "value for taxpayers' money".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knutsfordguardian.co.uk/news/4446313.Osborne_claimed___47_for_DVDs_of_his_speech_on__value_for_taxpayers__money_/|title='Tatton MP George Osborne claimed <U+00A3>47 expenses for DVDs of his speech on "value for taxpayers' money"'|accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref> Parliament's standards commissioner's report found that although Mr Osborne had breached the rules the offence was "unintended and relatively minor". Osborne had been told at the time by the Fees Office that his claims would be within the rules. "We entirely accept that Mr Osborne derived no significant benefit from them," the report added. The BBC's Political Correspondent Iain Watson said the repayment was relatively small in comparison with those made by some other MPs and would not be regarded as politically damaging.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8466921.stm|title='Osborne agrees to repay <U+00A3>1,936 after expenses breach'|accessdate=21 January 2010 | work=BBC News | date=21 January 2010}}</ref>

===2010 general election campaign===
During the 2010 general election campaign, Osborne was considered to have been sidelined due to his perceived unpopularity and the perception as a 'weak link' by both the Liberal Democrat and Labour strategists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/07/general-election-2010-georgeosborne|title='Where's George Osborne? I'm curious'|accessdate=28 April 2009 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Tall}}</ref>

==Political views==
The ''[[Financial Times]]'' describes Osborne as "metropolitan and socially liberal. He is hawkish on foreign policy with links to Washington [[neo-conservatives]] and ideologically committed to cutting the state. A pragmatic Eurosceptic".<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19dff8ce-2089-11df-bf2d-00144feab49a.html A Conservative Who's Who] FT.com</ref> There is evidence of this commitment to cutting the state in his party's manifesto, with Mr Osborne and the Conservatives seeking to cut the deficit "faster and deeper" than any other main party as well as committing to various tax cuts such as inheritance tax and national insurance. According to an [[Institute for Fiscal Studies|IFS]] report before the 2010 election,<ref>[http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/general-election-2010-parties-misleading-voters-over-deficit-warns-think-tank-ifs-tele-6015a50cb1a6.html?x=0 General Election 2010: Parties misleading voters over deficit, warns think tank IFS] Yahoo! Finance, 27 April 2010</ref> the Conservatives needed to find more money from cuts beyond what they had outlined than any other major party, although the report was also critical of Labour and the Lib Dems.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
Osborne was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on 12 May 2010 and as per custom with Cabinet Minsters, was sworn in as a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] the next day.<ref name="pc-13may2010">{{cite web

On 24 May 2010, he outlined <U+00A3>6.2bn cuts. Among the bigger savings for this financial year outlined by Osborne were <U+00A3>683m at the [[Department for Transport]], <U+00A3>780m at the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]], <U+00A3>836m at Business, <U+00A3>670m at Education and <U+00A3>325m Department for Justice. Osborne said, "We simply cannot afford to increase public debt at the rate of <U+00A3>3bn each week.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8699522.stm |title=George Osborne outlines detail of <U+00A3>6.2bn spending cuts |publisher=BBC News |date=24 May 2010}}</ref>

In July 2010, Osborne seeking cuts of up to 25 per cent in government spending to tackle the deficit, taking on the <U+00A3>20 billion cost of building four new [[Vanguard class submarine|Vanguard-class submarine]] to bear [[UK Trident programme|Trident]] would require a severe reduction in the rest of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] budget. The Chancellor insisted that Trident had to be considered as part of the MoD<U+2019>s core funding. He said, <U+201C>The Trident costs, I have made it absolutely clear, are part of the defence budget.<U+201D> He warned that if Trident was considered core funding, there would have to be severe restrictions in the way that Britain operated militarily, amid suggestions that regiments could be axed, or, potentially, the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]] amalgamated. [[Liam Fox]] said, "To take the capital cost would make it very difficult to maintain what we are currently doing in terms of capability."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/7916513/George-Osborne-Trident-is-not-exempt-from-budget-cuts.html |title=George Osborne: Trident is not exempt from budget cuts |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2010 |location=London |first=Rosa |last=Prince}}</ref>

On 4 October 2010, in a speech at the Conservative conference in [[Birmingham]], Osborne announced a cap on the overall amount of benefits a family can receive from the state, estimated to be around <U+00A3>500 a week from 2013. It has been estimated this could result in 50,000 unemployed families losing an average of <U+00A3>93 a week. He also announced that he would end the universal entitlement to [[child benefit]], and removed the entitlement from people on the 40% and 50% [[income tax]] rates from 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/oct/04/george-osborne-cap-welfare-payments|title=George Osborne to cap welfare payments|publisher=The Guardian |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2010 |location=London |first=Helene |last=Mulholland}}</ref>

In January 2011 a figure of 0.5 percent contraction in the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom economy]] was announced. While the cold weather in December was a factor, the [[Office of National Statistics]] said, that without that detrimental aspect the growth would have been ''flattish''. Hetal Mehta from Dalwa Capitol commented that the economy was clearly vulnerable and that, moving forward, a bumpy ride could be expected. Osborne said that the figures were disappointing but that there was strong performances and growth from sections of the economy less affected by the weather, such as in [[manufacturing]]. Osborne said the poor figures and bad weather would not affect implementation of his austerity measures and budget deficit reduction, and that he would not be "blown off course."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12272717|title=UK economy suffers 0.5% contraction|publisher=The BBC|date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2011 Osborne announced [[Project Merlin]] whereby banks will lend about <U+00A3>190bn to businesses this year - including <U+00A3>76bn to small firms - curb bonuses and reveal some salary details of their top earners. The [[Bank of England]] will monitor whether loans targets are being met. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman [[Lord Oakeshott]] resigned after the agreement was announced. This was in addition to the government increasing its levy on banks to <U+00A3>2.5bn this year - raising an extra <U+00A3>800m. [[HSBC]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group have signed up to the Project Merlin agreement, while Santander has agreed to the lending parts of the deal. Other pledges include providing <U+00A3>200m of capital for David Cameron's [[Big Society]] Bank, which is supposed to finance community projects.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12402469 Banks agree Project Merlin lending and bonus deal]</ref>
