The '''Augustinians''', named after [[Saint]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] (died AD [[430]]), are several [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[monastic order]]s and congregations of both men and women living according to a guide to religious life known as the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Rule of Saint Augustine]]. [http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=624 Prominent Augustinians] include the only English [[Pope Adrian IV]]<ref>Sources quoted in the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01156c.htm] New Advent Encyclopaedia, cf.<cite> Cardinal Boso's life, published by Muratori (SS.

The order has made a very significant [[missionary]] contribution to Christianity as well as establishing educational and charitable institutions throughout the world.

==The five main branches of the order internationally==
The Augustinian family worldwide is made up of five main branches
# '''The Order of the Hermit Friars of Saint Augustine'''; the friars subject to the jurisdiction of the Prior General (International leader)
# [[Augustinian nuns]] or sisters of contemplative life ([[Enclosed religious orders| enclosed]] nuns)
# other Augustinian orders not under the jurisdiction of the Prior General such as the [[Ursulines]]
# religious congregations of apostolic life (active congregations of men or women)
# lay fraternities and societies established under the name and teaching of Saint Augustine.

Some of the most visible contemporary groups of Augustinians include:

'''[[The Order of the Hermit Friars of Saint Augustine]]''' 

The O.S.A.'s, formerly called Augustinian [[Hermits]], but today known as Augustinian [[Friars]] or Austin Friars, are a [[mendicant orders|mendicant]] order. Being friars, they pray the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] throughout every day. This [[Latin Rite]] branch is active in society (ie. not [[Enclosed religious orders| enclosed]]) and it is counted comprehensively in the article below. It is headed by the international Prior-General in Rome, and while spiritually and historically connected is now canonically separate from the other [[Independent Augustinian Communities]] such as the [[Canons Regular]], [[Discalced Augustinians]], [[Augustinian nuns]], [[Order of the Canons Regular of Premontre|Premontres]], [[Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception]], [[Augustinian Recollects]] and [[Dominican Order|the Dominicans]].

The modern order of friars (Under the Prior General in Rome) is associated with the [[United Nations]] as a [[Non Government Organisation|Non-Governmental Organization]] and maintains a full-time representative to the United Nations. Worldwide there are nearly 2,800 Augustinian friars working in:

===Augustinian lay societies===
The lay societies are voluntary groups, generally made up of people who are either married or single and have sympathy with, and interest in, the Augustinian approach to life. These lay people do not take the monastic vows, but offer support to the work of the Augustinian order through voluntary work, gifts of money and goods, and the study and promotion of Augustine and Augustinian teaching. The [http://www.santaritadacascia.org/agostiniani/famigla_agostiniana_confra-en.htm Brotherhood of the Virgin Mary of the Belt] in Italy, the [http://www.osa-tabalong.org/friends/index.php Friends of Augustine] in the Philippines, the [http://www.augustinians.org.au/laygroups/community.html Augustinian Lay community] and the [http://www.augustinians.org.au/laygroups/friends.html Augustinian Friends] in Australia are some examples of Augustinian lay societies.

==Aggregated communities==
Other orders and groups belong within the Augustinian family either because they follow the Rule of Augustine or have been formally aggregated through their constitutions into the worldwide Augustinian Order. These are not counted comprehensively in this article only because the Catholic church's system of governance and accounting makes only the numbers of ordained priests relatively accessible and verifiable. Some of these include:
*The [[Hieronymites]], the [[Sisters of St Rita]], the [[Ursulines]], the [[Augustinian Sisters of Mercy of Jesus]] (South Africa), the [[Augustinians of the Assumption]] (which includes [[Byzantine Rite]] congregations), The [[Alexian Brothers]] (located in the USA, Europe, England, Ireland the Philippines and India), the [[Brothers of the Assumption]] (in the Congo), the [[Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation]] (Philippines), the [[Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions]], the [[Hospitallers of the Mercy of Jesus]] (Canada), the [[Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word]]<ref>c.f.<cite> The Rule of Saint Augustine and the Constitutions of the Order of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament </cite> New York: Schwartz, Kirwin, and Fauss, 1893, pp. 33<U+2013>35. </ref> (who established the [[University of the Incarnate Word]] in Texas), and the '''Sisters of St Joan of Arc''' (in Quebec, United States, and Rome) are just some of the Augustinian family of orders. Historically like the Benedictines, the Augustinain Order was by nature an order for laymen and women, the [[Canons Regular]] represent the clerical aspect of male religious life, while they are not Augustinians as such they follow the Rule of Augustine, hence the official name of the Order being the [[Canons Regular]] of St. Augustine and the false link with the Augustinian Order sometimes being made.  The [[Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem]] are a newly founded [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine rite]] congregation.

==The Augustinian Rule==<!-- This section is linked from [[Augustinians]] -->
The ancient [http://www.geocities.com/Athens/1534/ruleaug.html Rule] of life formally constituted for the hermits around 1243, had its origins established soon after St. Augustine was converted by [[Ambrose]] in Milan around the year 384 AD. He and some friends returned to his native [[Thagaste]] in [[North Africa]], gave away their possessions and began a life of prayer and study. Probably, Augustine didn't compose a formal monastic rule despite the extant Augustinian Rule <ref name="The Rule">Augustine of Hippo<cite> The Rule of St Augustine</cite> Constitutiones Ordinis Fratrum S. Augustini (Rome 1968) </ref>. Augustine's hortatory letter to the nuns at Hippo Regius (''Epist''., ccxi, [[Benedictine]] ed.) is not considered a formal Monastic rule by some scholars <ref>c.f <cite> Schaff Herzog Encyclopaedia</cite> on which the beginnings of this article are based</ref>. However, the present rule has strong consonance with the existing writings and teaching of Augustine of Hippo.

Three sets of the "Augustinian Rule" have been attributed to Augustine's authorship (texts in [[Holstenius]]-[[Brockie]], ''Codex regularum monasticarum'', ii, [[Augsburg]], [[1759]], 121<U+2013>127), the longest of which, a medieval compilation from certain pseudo-Augustinian sermons in 45 chapters, is the one commonly known as the ''regula Augustini'', and served as the constitution of the ''Augustinian Canons'' and many societies imitating them, as, for example, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s and [[Arrouaise (Abbey and Order)|Arrouaisians]]. 

The extant Augustinian orders claim lineage from the communities founded by Augustine of Hippo, and while the history of ideas is evident, historic continuity is not conclusively proven according to the standards of contemporary historical method. The most likely process of transmission occurred between the years 430 and 570 as the Roman empire collapsed - rapidly in Roman North Africa. Augustine's style of communal living was carried into Europe by monks and clergy fleeing the onslaught of the [[Vandal]] tribes under [[Geiseric]]. Around 440 [[Quodvultdeus]] of Carthage established communities in Naples. St. [[Fulgentius of Ruspe]] arrived in Sardinia by 502 and introduced Augustinian teaching there. The 5th century [[Donatus]] and his monks probably brought a form of it to Southern Spain around the year 570 when he established the ''Monasterium Servitanum'' <ref>c.f <cite>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05630c.htm New Advent Encyclopaedia] </cite> references to this exist in the later writings of [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore]], [[Ildephonsus of Toledo|St.Ildephonsus]] and [[Saint Eutropius|Eutropius]]</ref>.  A form of Augustine's Rule was later used as a basis for the reform of monasteries and cathedral chapters during the 11th century. [[Clare of Montefalco|Clare]] of [[Montefalco]] was one of the first abbesses to adopt the formally constituted Augustinian rule in her monastery in 1291. The rule was also adopted by the [[Dominicans]], [[Canons Regular]] of the [[Abbey of St. Victor]] in Marseilles (before its suppression), the [[Abbey of St Victor, Paris]] (a precursor to the [[University of Paris]]) as well as the [[Premonstratensians]] and Lateran Canons.

==History of the Grand Union==
The year 1256 is usually quoted as the date of the Grand Union that brought the modern order into existence, but there is some scholarly discussion over the exact date of the formal constitution of the Augustinian order, as it occurred in stages. By the [[11th century]] there had appeared historically identifiable groups of clerics in various part of Europe who renounced private property and lived together in community following the Rule of St. Augustine described above. The consolidation of this movement can be connected to the changes proposed by the [[Gregorian Reform]]. In 1243 the decree, ''Incumbit Nobis'' was issued by Pope Innocent IV, and it called together a number of monastic communities in Tuscany. The Augustinians owed their formal existence to the policy of [[Pope]]s [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] ([[1241]]<U+2013>[[1254]]) and  [[Pope Alexander IV]] ([[1254]]<U+2013>[[1261]]), who wished to counterbalance the influence of the powerful [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominicans]] by means of a similar order under more direct papal authority and devoted to papal interests.

The Augustinian Hermits (who are generally meant by the name "Augustinians", one branch of which [[Martin Luther]] belonged to) became the last of the great [[mendicant]] [[Catholic order|orders]] to be formally constituted in the [[thirteenth century]].
It is historically verifiable that Innocent IV, by the bull issued [[16 December]], [[1243]] united a number of small hermit societies with Augustinian rule, especially the [[Williamites]], the [[John-Bonites]], and the [[Brictinans]].

Alexander IV (admonished, it was said, by an appearance of Saint Augustine) called a general assembly of the members of the new united order under the presidency of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Richard of [[Saint Angeli]] at the monastery of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] in [[Rome]] in March, [[1256]], when the head of the John-Bonites, [[Lanfranc Septala]], of [[Milan]], was chosen general prior of the united orders. Alexander's bull ''Licet ecclesiae catholicae''<ref>Licet ecclesiae catholicae <cite>Bullarium Taurinense, 3rd ed., 635 sq.</cite> issued on 4 May, 1256</ref>, confirmed this choice. The new order was thus finally constituted with Italian, Hungarian, French, English, Belgian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swiss, Austrian and German Augustinian friars united into one international order. Pope Alexander IV afterward allowed some houses of the Williamites, who were dissatisfied with the new arrangement, to withdraw from the union, and they adopted the Benedictine rule.

Several general chapters in the thirteenth century ([[1287]] and [[1290]]) and toward the end of the [[16th century|sixteenth]] ([[1575]] and [[1580]]), after the severe crisis occasioned by Luther's reformation, developed the statutes to their present form (text in Holstenius-Brockie, ut sup., iv, 227<U+2013>357; cf. Kolde, 17<U+2013>38), which was confirmed by [[Pope Gregory XIII]]. A bull of Pius V in [[1567]] had already assigned to the Hermits of Saint Augustine the place next to the last (between Carmelites and Servites) among the five chief mendicant orders.

==The Augustinian ethos==
The teaching and writing of Augustine, the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Augustinian Rule]], and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over 16 centuries help define the ethos of the order, sometimes "honoured in the breach". 

As well as telling his disciples to be "of one mind and heart on the way towards God"<ref>Augustine of Hippo <cite> The Rule of St Augustine</cite> Constitutiones Ordinis Fratrum S. Augustini (Rome 1968) Chapter I</ref> Augustine of Hippo taught that "Nothing conquers except truth and the victory of truth is love" (''Victoria veritatis est caritas''}<ref>Augustine of Hippo <cite>Sermons 358,1</cite> "Victoria veritatis est caritas"</ref>, and the pursuit of truth through learning is key to the Augustinian ethos, balanced by the injunction to behave with love towards one another. It does not unduly single out the exceptional, especially favour the gifted, nor exclude the poor or marginalised. Love is not earned through human merit, but received and given freely by God's free gift of grace, totally undeserved yet generously given. These same imperatives of affection and fairness have driven the order in its international missionary outreach. This balanced pursuit of love and learning has energised the various branches of the order into building communities founded on mutual affection and intellectual advancement. The Augustinian ideal is inclusive. 

Augustine spoke passionately of God's "beauty so ancient and so new" <ref>Augustine of Hippo <cite>Confessions 10, 27</cite></ref>, and his fascination with beauty extended to music.  He taught that "to sing once is to pray twice" (''Qui cantat, bis orat'') <ref>Augustine of Hippo<cite> Sermons 336, 1</cite> PL 38, 1472 </ref>, and music is also a key part of the Augustinian ethos. Contemporary Augustinian musical foundations include the famous [[Augustinerkirche]] in Vienna where  Orchestral Masses by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] are performed every week, as well as the [http://www.florianer.at/site_en/ boys' choir] at [[Sankt Florian]] in Austria, a school conducted by Augustinian Canons, a choir now over 1,000 years old.

==History in Europe==
In its most flourishing state at the beginning of the 14th century A.D., the order in Europe had forty-two provinces (besides the two vicariates of [[India]] and [[Moravia]]) with 2,000 monasteries and about 30,000 members <ref>c.f. Augustino Lubin<cite> [http://www.cassiciaco.it/ITA/001ago/Agostiniani/lubin_conventi/lubin_600.htm ''Orbis Augustinianus sive conventuum] O. Erem. S. A. chorographica et topographica descriptio'', Paris, 1659, 1671, 1672 </cite></ref>. The [[Canons Regular]] and the [[Augustinian Recollects]] also have considerable history in Europe.

===German-speaking lands===
The successful [[Germany|German]] branch, which until [[1299]] was counted as one province, was then divided into four provinces. These provinces produced significant Augustinian leaders and reformers. These included the most famous German Augustinian theologian before the Augustinian [[Martin Luther]]: [[Andreas Proles]] (d. [[1503]]), the founder of the Union or Congregation of the Observant Augustinian Hermits, organized after strict principles; [[Johann von Paltz]], the famous [[Erfurt]] professor and pulpit-orator (d. [[1511]]); as well as [[Johann von Staupitz]], Luther's monastic superior and [[Wittenberg]] colleague (d. [[1524]]).

Reforms were also introduced into the extra-German branches of the order, but a long time after Proles's reform and in connection with the [[Counter-Reformation]] of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Augustinian credentials of [[Martin Luther]] did not prevent [[anti-clerical]] attacks on the order during the [[Reformation]], and neither did it enhance the order's political influence within the Catholic church during the [[Counter-Reformation]].

===Spanish-speaking and French-speaking lands===
The order of friars in [[Spain]] and [[France]] has had an eventful history, from being part of the Grand Union, through the periods of extensive Spanish colonisation, the [[French Revolution]], the effects of the [[Napoleonic wars]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], suppression of the order, the [[Spanish Civil War]], and then [[Francisco Franco]]. 

Historically, the other most important of the observant Augustinian congregations are the Spanish Augustinian tertiary nuns, founded in [[1545]] by Archbishop [[Thomas of Villanova]] at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]; the "reformed" Augustinian nuns who originated under the influence of Augustinian educated [[Carmelite]] [[Teresa of <U+00C1>vila|St Theresa]] after the end of the sixteenth century at [[Madrid]], [[Alcoi|Alcoy]], and in [[Portugal]]; and the barefoot Augustinians (in France ''Augustins d<U+00E9>chauss<U+00E9>s'') founded about [[1560]] by [[Thomas a Jesu]] (d. [[1582]]).

A significant Augustinian missionary college was established at the former Spanish capital of [http://augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=945 Valladolid] in 1759 - and this house was exempted from the suppression of monastic houses in Spain c.1835, later becoming the centre of restoration for the order in Spain. In 1885 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Augustinians took charge of the famous [[Escorial]], and friars continue to administer it today. The modern Augustinian province of Spain was refounded in 1926- largely through Spanish and Filipino friars from the Philippines- but that was not the end of difficulty for the order in Spain. During the Spanish Civil War (1936<U+2013>39) ninety eight Augustinians were murdered - sixty five friars from the Escorial alone were executed. Many of the discalced [[Augustinian nuns]] of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] were also put to death.

As of 2006 there were 177 Spanish Augustinian friars, with 23 in simple profession. <ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in Spain </cite> [http://www.osanet.org/whereweare/en/default.asp?page=europe.asp&language=en&section=whe International Order of St. Augustine]</ref>

===Setbacks in Europe===
Many European Augustinian priories and foundations suffered serious setbacks (including suppression and destruction) from the various periods of [[anti-clericalism]] during the Reformation and other historical events such as the [[French Revolution]], the [[Spanish civil war]] (among more than 6,000 clergy, 155 Spanish Augustinians were killed) <ref name="Moreno">The statistics come from ''Historia de la Persecuci<U+00F3>n Religiosa en Espa<U+00F1>a (1936<U+2013>1939)'' by Antonio Montero Moreno (Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos, 3rd edition, 1999)</ref>, the two [[World Wars]] and [[Communist]] repression.

===Latest statistics in Europe===
As of 2006 there were 148 active Augustinian priories in Europe, including Germany, Belgium, Poland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Malta, Spain and Spanish houses in the Philippines. This includes 1,031 friars<ref>N.B.<cite> Augustinian friars</cite> numbers cited from information on the website [http://www.osanet.org International Order of St. Augustine]</ref> in solemn vows, and 76 in simple vows.

==History in England==

In [[England]] and [[Ireland]] of the 14th century the Augustinian order had had over 800 friars, but these priories had declined (for other reasons) to around 300 friars before the [[anti-clerical]] laws of the [[Reformation Parliament]] and the [[Act of Supremacy 1559|Act of Supremacy]]. The friaries were dispersed from 1538 in the [[dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution of monasteries]] during the [[English Reformation]]. The martyr [[St John Stone]] was one of the few British Augustinians to publicly defy the will of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in this matter. The partial [[List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England]] alone includes 19 Augustinian houses. [[Clare Priory]] was one of the houses dissolved by King Henry VIII, but the Order managed to buy it back in 1953, with help from the family who then owned it.

==History in Ireland==
The English Province of the Order of Saint Augustine founded their first house in Dublin some time before 1280, and for a considerable time the Augustinians of Ireland were all English, effectively serving the English settlers in Ireland. [[Great Connell Priory]] was founded about 1202. However, by the mid 14th century thirteen houses of the Order had been established in Ireland. The Irish branch was relatively poor, and very few of the indigenous Irish friars were sent to the universities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] for their education (unlike the English Augustinians). The fortunes of the Irish order changed in 1361 when [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel]], the second son of [[King Edward III]], became viceroy of Ireland. He favoured the order, and soon established an Augustinian professor of theology based at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], and the Irish then order grew significantly until the time of the [[English Reformation]].

In Ireland  after the [[Reformation Parliament]] that began in 1529, the Augustinian houses in [[Leinster]], [[Munster]], [[Dublin]], [[Dungarvan]] and [[Drogheda]] were soon suppressed. The houses in [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ardnaree]], [[Ballinrobe]], [[Ballyhaunis]], Banada and [[Murrisk]] managed to remain functioning until 1610. By decree in 1542 the English parliament had allowed the Augustinian community at [[Dunmore]] in [[County Galway]], Ireland to continue. After 1610 the Dunmore community was the only surviving foundation, and in 1620 the Irish Province of the Augustinians was given pastoral charge of both England (where all houses had been forcibly closed) and Ireland. Irish Augustinian students were sent to the Continent to study, and the Irish Augustinians continued their work in Ireland under the harsh English [[Penal laws]] designed to protect the [[State religion|establishment]] of the [[Church of England]]. A number were executed - including [[William Tirry]][http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=819] OSA (executed 1654 for saying mass). In 1656, in response to the persecution at home, [[Pope Alexander VII]] established the Irish Augustinians in Rome in the church and priory of San Matteo in Merulana. Many Augustinians though remained in Ireland. In 1751 Augustine Cheevers O.S.A, an Irish Augustinian, was made [[Bishop of Ardagh]]. Others left to work in America and after the 1830s to Australia. After the [[Catholic Emancipation]] Act of 1829, the order began to re-organise more openly in Ireland. The Irish friars took the Order back to England, establishing a priory at [[Hoxton]], London in 1864. They further turned their attention to Nigeria, Australia, America and missionary work. The contemporary Irish order conducts parishes, a school in [[St. Augustine's College (Dungarvan)|Dungarvan]] (founded 1874), a school in [[St Augustine's and Good Counsel College, New Ross|New Ross]] and special ministries in Ireland.

Contemporary Ireland is undergoing rapid change, and this presents challenges to the order there. Many Irish emigrants (including Augustinian friars) are now returning. Over [[Ireland#Demographics|40,000 immigrants each year are admitted]] to keep the Irish economy working, and many are coming from the new Eastern European members of the [[European Union]]. For example, there are now over 100,000 Poles in the country as well as asylum seekers from Africa and the Balkan countries. The formerly unified Celtic culture of Ireland is diversifying, and this means its predominantly Celtic Catholic ethos as well.

==Measuring the growth or decline of the Augustinian Order internationally==
Given that the Roman Catholic church in the Western world has been experiencing a decline in vocations to the priesthood and religious life since the 1960s, a relatively simple way to assess the vigour of this order is to compare the numbers of those in solemn [[Profession (religious)|profession]] (vows) with those in simple [[Profession (religious)|profession]]. For a mendicant order such as the Augustinians, the most formal and significant commitments are the permanent and lifelong [[vows]] of Solemn profession. Ordination is considered a separate matter, and though most are, the Augustinian friar may or may not be ordained priest or deacon. Those in simple profession are the newer members of the order, but have agreed to make a serious commitment (temporary, but with a view to permanent commitment), and been formally accepted as suitable by senior members of the order to make that formal commitment. The figures quoted do not include aspirants to the order who have not reached the significant step of simple profession. The details of the median age of friars in respective national grouping is another way of assessing the vigour of the order, but these details are not included here. They may be found on the order's international website. Likewise, the growth of [[laity|lay]] organisations of Augustinian spirituality is another (less-precise) way of measuring the vigour of the order.

==History in the New World: North America==
[[Image:Saint thomas villanova church.JPG|300px|thumb|Right|St. Thomas of Villanova Church, on the Villanova University campus.]]

The North American foundation of the order happened in 1796 when Irish friars founded [http://www.ushistory.org/tour/tour_staug.htm Olde St. Augustine's Church] in Philadelphia. Michael Hurley was the first American to join the Order the following year. Friars established schools, Universities and other works throughout the Americas, including [[Villanova University]] (1842) near Philadelphia (USA) and [[Merrimack College]] (1947, USA). While [[Malvern Preparatory School]] was founded in 1842 alongside the University, by 1909 two Augustinian houses and a [[St. Rita of Cascia High School|school]] had been established in Chicago, 1922 in [[St. Augustine High School|San Diego]], by 1925 [[Villanova Preparatory School|a school in Ojai]] and Los Angeles; 1926 [[Cascia Hall Preparatory School|a school in Oklahoma]]; in 1947 [[Merrimack College|a college in Massachusetts]]; in 1953 [[Monsignor Bonner High School|a school in Pennsylvania]]; 1959 [[St. Augustine College Preparatory School|a school in New Jersey]]; in 1961 [[Austin Preparatory School|a school in Massachusetts]]; and in 1962 a [[Providence Catholic High School|school in Illinois]]  . The [[Augustinian Recollects]] are also present in the U.S.A. as are the [[Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception]].

The Order's 20th century establishment in [[Canada]]<ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in North America </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=636 Augnet historical information]</ref> was one result of both poverty and political trouble being experienced by German Augustinians. From 1925 and later during the [[Great Depression]] German Augustinians began arriving in North America to teach. After 1936, with the political situation in Nazi Germany worsening, more German Augustinians departed for North America. By 1939 from there were 46 German priests, 13 German religious brothers and 8 German candidates in North America. The order established the first of their Canadian houses at Tracadie, [[Nova Scotia]] in Canada in 1938. Among other Canadian foundations, the order also established a significant priory and [[St. Thomas of Villanova College|school]] in Toronto. The order, by 2006 has since professed many native Canadians.

===Latest statistics for the United States and Canada===
As of 2006 there were more than 70 Augustinian priories in the United States and Canada with 386 friars<ref>N.B.<cite> Augustinian friars</cite> numbers cited from information on the website [http://www.osanet.org International Order of St. Augustine]</ref> in solemn vows and 16 in simple vows.

==History in the New World: Latin America ==
[[Image:Convento san agustin 1.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Monastery of San Agustin of Yuriria, Mexico, founded in 1550.]] 
[[Image:Yecapixtlaconvent.JPG|thumb|left|220px|View of the 16th century convent-fortress of [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocat<U+00E9>petl|Yecapixtla]], [[Mexico]].]]
Sent by their Provincial St.[[Thomas of Villanova]], the first group of Spanish/Castilian Augustinians arrived in Mexico in 1533<ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in the Americas </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=700 Augnet historical information]</ref>. They soon formed multiple priories, including at [[Guanajuato]] (pictured) and were later instrumental in establishing the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Pontifical and Royal University of Mexico]]. By 1562 there were nearly 300 Spanish Augustinians in Mexico, and they had established some 50 priories. Their history in Mexico was not to be an easy one, given the civil strife of events like the [[Cristero War]], periodic [[anti-clericalism]] and suppression of the church that was to follow.

Spanish Augustinians first went to [[Peru]] in 1551. From there they went to [[Ecuador]] in 1573, and from Ecuador in 1575 to [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]] and [[Venezuela]]. The order founded the Ecuadorean University of [[Quito]] in 1586. Augustinians also entered [[Argentina]] via Chile between 1617 and 1626, and their history there was eventful. The order had considerable [[State-Church relations in Argentina|property confiscated by the Argentinian government]] under the [[secularisation]] laws in the 19th century, and were entirely suppressed for 24 years until 1901 when they returned.

Augustinians from Ecuador went to Bolivia in 1575. The Augustinian Province of Holland later also founded houses in Bolivia from 1930. The Order (from Mexico) arrived in [[Cuba]] in 1608. It was suppressed by force in 1842. In 1892 American Augustinians went back to Cuba from the Province of Villanova in the USA and remained there until 1961 when they were expelled by the government of [[Fidel Castro]].

The [[Augustinian Recollects]] are also present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama,  Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. The [[Canons Regular]] are present in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay.

===Latest statistics for Central and South America===
In Central and South America<ref>N.B.<cite> South American Augustinian friars</cite> numbers not available online</ref>, the Augustinians remain established in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela as well three Peruvian Vicariates of Iquitos, Apurimac and Chulucanas, and the Province of Peru. There are currently 814 friars in Latin America.

== History in Africa==
The Augustinians followed the Portuguese flag in Africa and the Gulf behind the explorer and seafarer [[Vasco da Gama]]<ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in Africa </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=625 Augnet historical information]</ref>. He had sailed from Lisbon in 1497, and arrived at [[Mozambique]] in March 1498. Portuguese Augustinians also worked on the island of [[Sao Tome]], in Warri (Nigeria) and in what is now known as [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], and [[Gabon]] up until 1738. The Portuguese also took control of the port of [[Goa]] in [[India]] - giving the Augustinians a foothold there also. Besides the early Portuguese Augustinians, other Augustinian missionaries have since followed to Africa from America, [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]] and [[Australia]]. The '''Augustinian Sisters of Mercy of Jesus''' established themselves in [[South Africa]] in 1891, and at their invitation they were joined in their work by American friars in 1997.

===Latest statistics for Africa===
As of 2006, there were more than 30 other Augustinian priories in [[Nigeria]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[South Africa]] and [[Algeria]], with over 85 friars<ref>N.B.<cite> Augustinian friars</cite> numbers cited from information on the website [http://www.osanet.org International Order of St. Augustine]</ref> in solemn vows, and more than 60 in simple vows. There are also Augustinians working in the Republic of [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Guinea]] and [[Burkina]].

==History in Asia==
===The Philippines===
The Augustinians were the first Christian missionaries to arrive in what is now regarded as Asia's only Catholic nation, and the leader of these first missionaries was the navigator [[Andr<U+00E9>s de Urdaneta]] (b. [[1498]] - d. [[June 3]], [[Mexico]], [[1568]]), an Augustinian [[friar]]. He was navigator on the journey that established the first permanent Spanish settlement in the [[Philippines]].  The historic [[Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines|Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines]] of the Order of St. Augustine was officially formed on December 31, 1575 as an offshoot of the establishment of the first permanent Spanish settlements. [[San Agustin Church|San Agust<U+00ED>n Church and Monastery]] in Manila became the center of Augustinian efforts to evangelise the Philippines. The order still has responsibility for one of the oldest churches in the Philippines, the [[Basilica Minore del Santo Ni<U+00F1>o|Basilica del Santo Ni<U+00F1>o de Cebu]] in Cebu. Before the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1898 which accelerated the [[separation of church and state in the Philippines]], the Augustinians conducted  more than 400 hundred schools and churches there and had pastoral care for some 2,237,000 Filipinos, including 328 village missions. The Philippine Revolution of 1896 cost the order its heaviest losses in the entire nineteenth century, breaking the historic connection with, or destroying the majority of its established works there. This included the removal of friars from 194 parishes, the capture of 122 friars by Filipino revolutionaries and the deprivation of income from 240 friars. Many Spanish Augustinians were forced to leave the country for Spain or Latin America, repopulating the Augustinian houses in Spain and reinforcing Augustinian missionary work in South America.  

In 1904 members of the order belonging to the Philippine province established the [[University of San Agustin]] in [[Iloilo City]], Philippines.  They have also since established schools such as the [[Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod]] in [[Negros Occidental]] (1962), the [[Colegio San Agustin, Makati]] (1969) and the [[Colegio San Agustin, Bi<U+00F1>an]] in [[Bi<U+00F1>an, Laguna]] (1985). In 1968 friars of the Philippine province re-established the Augustinian presence on the Indian subcontinent.

In 2004 the all-Filipino Augustinian Province of Cebu celebrated its twentieth year of existence. It has 85 members in final vows with 19 in simple profession. There are 12 priories including a mission on Socorro Island <ref> c.f.<cite> Augustinians in the Philippines </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=712&iparentid=711 Augnet historical information]</ref>. 

The order of friars is once again growing in the Philippines. The [[Augustinian Recollects]] are also present in the Philippines.

===Japan===
Despite a vigorous early [[Nagasaki#Medieval era|Christian foundation]] in [[Nagasaki]] by [[Jesuits]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Filipino]] Augustinians <ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in Japan </cite> http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=679&iparentid=678</ref> and the many 17th century [http://www.osa-west.org/japanesemartyrs.html Japanese Augustinian martyrs], the earlier Augustinian mission attempts eventually failed after the repression of [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] (ruled 1605<U+2013>1623; second Tokugawa shogun of Japan) and the expulsion of Christians under [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] (ruled 1623 to 1651; third Tokugawa shogun of Japan). 

However, American Augustinian friars returned to Japan in 1954, symbolically establishing their first priory in 1959 at Nagasaki (also site of the second [[atomic bomb]] dropped on August 13th, 1945). They then established priories in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] (1959), [[Nagoya]] (1964), and [[Tokyo]] (1968). As of 2006, there are seven United States Augustinian friars and five Japanese Augustinian friars.

Early Japanese Augustinian leaders, including [http://www.midwestaugustinians.org/saints/s_magdelinenagasaki.html St Magdalen of Nagasaki] and [http://augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1331&iparentid=756 St Thomas Jihyoe] are venerated as saints.

===Indonesia===
Two Dutch Augustinian friars re-established the order in [[Papua]] (now [[Indonesia]]) in 1953 while it was still a Dutch colony. In 1956 the order took responsibility for the area that was to become the Diocese of [[Manokwari]]. As of 2006, the Augustinian Vicariate of Indonesia has 15 friars in solemn profession, and 7 in simple vows. It is now predominantly Papuan. The '''Augustinian Sisters of God's Mercy''' are also present in Indonesia (including West Borneo). The first Dutch sisters had arrived in 1946, and the order is now entirely Indonesian with fourteen communities and 105 professed <ref>c.f. Augustinian news<cite> Augustinians </cite> http://www.augustinians.org.au/apac/bulletin_01.html</ref>.

The order of friars and affiliated orders are growing in Indonesia.

===Korea===
The Augustinian Recollects are also present in Korea, but for the Augustinian friars, the Region of [[Korea]] was founded in 1985 by Australian, English and Scottish friars. Filipinos later replaced the UK friars. As of 2006 there are 5 Koreans professed in the order and 12 in formation.<ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in Korea </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=694 Augnet historical information]</ref>.

The order of friars is growing numerically in Korea.

===India===
After an extensive period of expansion in India from the 15th century <ref>c.f. <cite> Augustinians in India</cite> [http://augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=659 Augnet historical information]</ref> the Portuguese Augustinians had not only established the order but also provided sixteen Indian bishops between 1579 and 1840. The order subsequently disappeared in India, cut off from its usual governance after the suppression of Portuguese monasteries in 1838, and the friars were forced to become secular priests. The order had failed successfully to establish itself as an autonomous indigenous Indian foundation.

However, the Augustinians were re-established by Filipino friars in 1968 at [http://augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=657 Cochin], and the Indian Augustinians took on further responsibilities in [[Kerala]] in 2005 <ref>c.f. Augustinian news<cite> Indian Augustinians </cite> http://www.augustinians.org.au/apac/bulletin_02.html</ref>. The Indian order currently has 16 ordained friars and 8 in simple vows. The order is growing numerically in India.

===China===
The first Western major work on the history of China was by Augustinian friar [[Juan Gonz<U+00E1>lez de Mendoza]]. It was a description of a visit to China by three others (including another Augustinian friar), and included the first known depiction of Chinese characters in Western publishing. In 1585 he published it at Rome in Spanish.

In about 1681, the Filipino Augustinian Alvaro de Benevente arrived in China and established the first of the Augustinian houses in China at [[Ganzhou|Kan-chou]]. Benevente was made bishop and became head of the newly-created Vicariate of [[Jiangxi|Kiang-si]] in 1699. The Augustinian missionaries had success in propagating Catholicism, but in 1708, during the [[Chinese Rites controversy]] they were forced to withdraw from China. Portuguese Augustinians also served in the colonial port of [[Macau]] from 1586 until 1712.

In 1879 Spanish Augustinians<ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in China </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=640&iparentid=638 Augnet historical information]</ref> from Manila (Elias Suarez O.S.A. and Agostino Villanueva O.S.A) entered China to re-establish an Augustinian mission. By 1910 the Augustinian mission had 24 members of the Order, two were indigenous Chinese. By 1947 the Augustinian mission counted 24,332 baptised Catholics as well as 3,250 preparing for baptism. They had established 20 major churches and 90 satellite churches. By that time there were 25 Chinese-born priests. '''Augustinian Recollects''' also established the (then) successful mission at [[Shangqiu|Kweiteh]] in [[Henan]] Province in 1923.

All foreign missionaries were expelled or imprisoned from 1953 by the Communist government. Chinese-born Augustinians were dispersed by government order and directed not to live the monastic life. Church officials were arrested, schools and other church institutions closed or confiscated by the State. Many priests, religious brothers and sisters, as well as leaders among the Christian [[laity]] were sent to labour camps. One of the last of the pre-Revolution Chinese Augustinians was Father Dai O.S.A.. He died in 2003.

====Latest information on China====
Since the re-unification of the former colonies of Macau and Hong-Kong with the central Chinese government and further developments in government religious policy, [[Roman Catholicism in China]] - including clergy, Roman Catholic bishops, and a Cardinal - once again exists openly alongside the members of the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]] and their co-religionists in the continuing underground Church.

The Augustinian have recently re-established friendly relations with Chinese educational organisations through school-placement programmes<ref>c.f. <cite> Australian Augustinian School Principal from [[St. Augustine's College, Brookvale]] visits China </cite>[http://www.augustinians.org.au/news/the_augustinian0312.html Augnet News in 2003]</ref> as well as through the [[University of the Incarnate Word]] Chinese campus founded by the '''Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word'''.

While there are Chinese Augustinian friars, there is not yet a priory in mainland China re-established.

====Other Augustinians in Taiwan====
The [[Augustinian Recollects]] are established in Taiwan, at [http://www.recoletos.ph/article/articleview/155/1/11/ Kaohsiung]. They are supported by Filipino Recollects from the Province of St. Ezekiel Moreno. Likewise the '''Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation''' are established there in [[Hsinchu]] city. The [[Canons Regular]] of Saint Augustine are also present in Taiwan.

===Latest statistics for Asia===
As of 2006 (and not counting Spanish Augustinian priories) there were more than 21 other Augustinian houses across the [[Philippines]], [[India]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Indonesia]], with more than 140 friars<ref>N.B.<cite> Augustinian friars</cite> numbers cited from information on the website [http://www.osanet.org International Order of St. Augustine]</ref> in solemn vows and more than 40 in simple vows.

The order of friars is growing in Asia.

==History in Australia==
Irishman [[James Goold|James Alipius Goold]] O.S.A, was the first Augustinian to arrive in the [[Australia|Australian]] colonies in 1838. He had been convinced to go to Australia by [[William Bernard Ullathorne]] (then the Benedictine Vicar-General of New Holland) after a chance meeting on the steps of the Roman Augustinian church at the monastery of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]]<ref name="Arneil">Arneil, Stan <cite>pp. 34 "Out Where the Dead Men Lie" (The Augustinians in Australia 1838<U+2013>1992) </cite>Augustinian Press Brookvale (1992). pp37.ISBN 0-949826-03-0</ref>. 

Goold began his missionary work in [[Sydney]] under Archbishop [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020300b.htm John Bede Polding], becoming parish priest at [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]]. Goold went on in 1848 to become the founding bishop and first [[Archbishop]] of the [[Archdiocese]] of [[Melbourne]]. He also commenced the design and construction of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|its Neo-Gothic Cathedral]]. Despite's Goold's initial desire to establish immediately an Australian branch of the order, the first Australian Augustinian was not ordained until 1940, and the Australian Province was not formally established as separate from its Irish founding province until 1952.

The Irish Augustinians formally accepted responsibility in 1884 for the part of Queensland that became the Diocese of [[Cairns]], and the first Australian priory was founded at [[Echuca]], Victoria in 1886. Priories were established at [[Rochester, Victoria|Rochester]] in 1889 and [[Kyabram]] in 1903. The order worked at different times in the colonies of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]], taking part in some critical moments of the settlement and establishment of modern Australia. [[Charles O'Hea]] O.S.A. baptized [[Ned Kelly]]. Father Matthew Downing O.S.A. tried to calm the miners who were part of the [[Eureka Stockade]] in 1854. The order also supplied a number of the other early Australian bishops including Martin Crane O.S.A. and Stephen Reville O.S.A both in [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandhurst|Sandhurst (Bendigo)]] John Heavey O.S.A. ([[Cairns]]), John Hutchinson O.S.A ([[Cooktown]]), and James Murray O.S.A ([[Cooktown]]).

The order presently conducts parishes, two schools (one established 1948 [[Villanova College|in Brisbane]], the other established 1956 [[St. Augustine's College, Brookvale|in Sydney]]), [[St John Stone]] House (a centre for Augustinian Spirituality), a formation centre, and special ministries such as [[palliative care]], HIV/AIDS ministry, and [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] ministry.

Associated orders such as the '''St John of God Brothers''' (arrived Australia 1947 and established mental health services) and the Filipino Augustinian '''Sisters of our Lady of Consolation''' also established an Australian house in the 1990s.

===Latest statistics for Australia===
As of 2006 there were 11 other Augustinian priories in Australia <ref>c.f.<cite> Augustinians in Australia </cite>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1102 Augnet historical information]</ref> with 36 friars in solemn vows, and one in simple vows. The order of friars is in numerical decline in Australia while affiliated orders are growing.

===Trivia===
There is a road named after the Augustinian order located in the City of London, by the name of Austin Friars.
