"'''Steven the Sword Fighter'''" is the sixteenth episode of the first season of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The episode, written by Joe Johnston and [[Jeff Liu]], sees Pearl ([[Deedee Magno]]) get injured and retreating into her gem to recover after she tries to teach Steven ([[Zach Callison]]) the art of sword-fighting using Holo Pearl, a holographic version of herself.

In the United States, the episode originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on April 9, 2014, the first new episode to air on the series' new Wednesday time slot. Pianist Aivi Tran and sound designer Steven Velma of the musical group Aivi & Surasshu composed one of the episode's soundtracks to resemble the "broken [[Fax|facsimile]]" nature of Holo Pearl. The episode was viewed by 1.098 million viewers, becoming the thirty-sixth most watched episode aired by the network for the week of April 7 to April 13, 2014.

==Plot==
While Steven ([[Zach Callison]]), Garnet ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), Amethyst ([[Michaela Dietz]]) and Pearl ([[Deedee Magno]]) are watching a fictional Japanese movie titled ''Lonely Blade'', Pearl critiques the film's sword fighting techniques and offers to show Steven how it's really done. To give him a proper demonstration, Pearl summons "Holo Pearl", a [[holographic]] version of herself to spar with. After Pearl wins the duel, she begins to show Steven the basics of sword fighting, but he wants to learn the movie's techniques. While she is distracted talking to Steven, Pearl is stabbed by the hologram and releases her physical form, leaving behind only her gem. Although Steven is distraught at first, Garnet and Amethyst assure him that Pearl has simply retreated into her gem and will return once she has fully regenerated.

Two weeks pass and Pearl is still inside her gem. Steven decides to use Holo Pearl has a replacement for the real Pearl. However, Holo Pearl only knows how to sword fight, seeing everything as a potential opponent. Garnet and Amethyst urge Steven to stop using it and wait for the real Pearl to come back. After Holo Pearl cuts down the real Pearl's favourite tree, Steven become infuriated and tells Holo Pearl to go away.

Later that night, Holo Pearl continues to try and challenge Steven, even though he repeatedly refuses. Eventually, Steven hits his breaking point and fights back against the hologram, accidentally activating its "advanced" mode. After an intense fight, Steven is able to destroy the hologram permanently. Garnet and Amethyst hear the commotion and come to check on Steven. While Steven is explaining what he has learned, Pearl regains her physical form, along with a new variation on her outfit.

==Cultural references==
Gergo Vas from ''[[Kotaku]]'' observed various video game references during Pearl's lecture on sword fighting, including ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Gitaroo Man]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. In addition, he identified an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' upon looking at [[GIF]]s of Pearl's sword-fighting scene with her hologram clone.<ref name="Vas2014"/> Writing for ''Cartoon Brew'', Kendra Beltran noted that ''Lonely Blade'' imitated the style of [[anime]], stating that "while the ''Universe'' team didn't overdo the animation on the anime, you could tell what they were going for without hearing the accents."<ref name="Beltran2014"/>

==Reception==
"Steven the Sword Fighter" was the first episode to premiere outside of Monday, onto its new time slot of Wednesdays, on [[Cartoon Network]].<ref name="Steven Crewniverse Behind-the-Scenes Universe2014a"/> Upon its premiere on April 9, 2014, the episode was seen by 1.098 million viewers.<ref name=<ref name="Zap2it 'Episode Guide'"/><ref name="Pucci2014"/> It received a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 0.7, and was ranked as the thirty-sixth most watched episode aired by the network for the week of April 7 to April 13, 2014.<ref name="Pucci2014"/><!-- The episode also saw [[digital distribution]] on [[Amazon Instant Video]], [[Google Play]] and [[iTunes]] upon its broadcast.<ref name="Amazon Instant Video2014"/><ref name="Google Play2014"/><ref name="iTunes 'Volume 1'"/>-->

Beltran highlighted elements of horror in the episode, noting it to come "in small spurts toward the end", while writing about the "eerie tone of the rainy night matched with the sword-wielding psychopath hologram."<ref name="Beltran2014"/> She found it "weird" seeing Steven trying not replace Pearl immediately, regarding her as the established mother figure in the series. She concluded her review stating that while "not much for [[characterization]]," Amethyst and Garnet's acts of "[[sitcom]] comedy" were "the source of laughter this time around" for the series.<ref name="Beltran2014"/>

Eric Thurm of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode an A<U+2212>, calling it, "in many ways, a perfect distillation of what makes ''Steven Universe'' special."<ref name="Thurm2014"/> He noted Steven's attempts to learn sword-fighting as a [[Callback (comedy)|call back]] to the first episode, "Gem Glow", which aired alongside "Steven the Sword Fighter" upon its premiere. Finally, he contrasted Steven's childishness and refusal to completely learn lessons to ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and ''[[Regular Show]]'', where the protagonists of each have taken steps toward maturity.<ref name="Thurm2014"/>
