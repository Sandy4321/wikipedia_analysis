[[Antigua and Barbuda]] competed at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], submitting a delegation that included athletes [[Daniel Bailey]], [[Brendan Christian]], [[James Grayman]], and [[Sonia Williams]] in track and field events, and [[Kareem Valentine]] in swimming. Antigua and Barbuda's appearance in Beijing marked its eighth appearance at the Summer Olympics since the nation's debut at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montr<U+00E9>al, Canada. There were no medalists from Antigua and Barbuda in 2008, although Bailey reached the quarterfinals and Christian the semifinals of their respective events.

==Background==
Antigua and Barbuda participated in eight Olympic Games between its debut at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montr<U+00E9>al and its 2008 appearance in Beijing, competing in every edition except for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. The 2008 Summer Olympic delegation was smaller than those of 1980s and 1990s, when they were composed of thirteen or more athletes, but, with five participants, it was the same size that it had been at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens. As of the conclusion of the Beijing Games, no Antiguan or Barbudan athlete has won a medal,<ref name=AB-sr /> although [[Brendan Christian]] progressed to semifinals and [[Daniel Bailey]] to quarterfinals of their respective events in 2008.<ref name=207ESPN /><ref name=256ESPN /> At the 2008 games Kareem Valentine was the youngest athlete at fifteen years of age and Sonia Williams was the eldest at twenty-nine.<ref name=ab08-sr />

The Foreign Ministry of Antigua and Barbuda supported the Chinese handling of the [[civil unrest]] in [[Tibet]], an issue marred in controversy due to self-immolations by [[Tibetan]]s and numerous crackdowns on protesters, and expressed support for Chinese efforts to host the Olympics in Beijing despite the controversy.<ref name=CN /> The flag-bearer for the Games was James Grayman, an [[Antiguan]] athlete.<ref name=bejingsic />
