The Indian [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]] borders with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and the Indian states of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa]], [[Assam]] and [[Sikkim]]. The [[Himalayas]] lies in the north of the state and the [[Bay of Bengal]] is at the south. In between them, the river [[Ganges]] flows eastwards and its main [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River]], flows south to reach the Bay of Bengal. The [[Siliguri Corridor]], which connects [[North-East India]] with rest of the India, lies in the [[North Bengal]] region of the state. Geographically, West Bengal is divided into a variety of regions<U+2014>[[Darjeeling Himalayan hill region]], [[Terai]] and Doors region, [[North Bengal plains]], [[Rarh region]], [[Western plateau and high lands]], coastal plains, [[Sunderbans]] and the [[Ganges Delta]].<ref name=swhydro/>

In 1947, when India gained independence, the state of West Bengal was formed with 14 districts, as per [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition plan]] of the then [[Bengal]] province of [[British India]].<ref name=parttionbanglaped/><ref name=partitionspoil/> The former princely state [[Koch Bihar]] joined as a district in 1950,<ref name=CBE/> and the former French enclave [[Chandannagore]] joined as part of the [[Hooghly district]] in 1954.<ref name=Chander/> The [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956 led to addition of [[Purulia district]] to the state and to enlargement of West Dinajpur district.<ref name=PF/> Later, larger districts such as West Dinajpur, 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated.

West Bengal is now divided into nineteen districts under three divisions.<ref name=blocdir/> Districts are administered by District Magistrates,<ref name=panchayatdef/> and divisions are administered by Divisional Commissioners.<ref name=blocdir/> [[Kolkata]], the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the state, constitutes the [[Kolkata district]]. Other districts are further divided into administrative units such as subdivisions and blocks, administered by SDO and BDO, respectively. The [[Panchayati Raj]] has a three-tier structure in the state. The atomic unit is called a [[Gram Panchayat]], which is the ''Panchayat'' organization for a collection of villages.<ref name=gpdef/> The block-level organizations are called ''Panchayat Samiti'',<ref name=psdef/> and the district-level organizations are named ''Zilla Parishad''.<ref name=zpdef/>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of West Bengal}}
West Bengal is bordered by three countries: Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh; and five Indian states: Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattishgarh, Orissa, and Assam. Sikkim and Bhutan are located at the north of the state, Nepal at the northwest, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattishgarh at the west, Orissa at the southwest, the Bay of Bengal at the south, and Bangladesh and Assam are at the east. West Bengal is the only state of India that has both the Himalayas in the north and the Bay of Bengal at the south. In between them, the river Ganges enters the state from west, before it branches off into its main distributaries: the Hooghly River, which flows southwards to reach the Bay of Bengal, and the [[Padma River]], which flows eastwards into Bangladesh.

The districts that are located at the north of the Ganges<U+2014>[[Darjeeling district|Darjeeling]], [[Jalpaiguri district|Jalpaiguri]], [[Cooch Behar district|Cooch Behar]], [[Malda district|Malda]], [[North Dinajpur district|North Dinajpur]] and [[South Dinajpur district|South Dinajpur]]<U+2014>are often referred to collectively as North Bengal.<ref name=swhydro>{{cite web | url = http://www.swhydro.arizona.edu/07symposium/presentationpdf/ChristianaD_pro.pdf | format=PDF | title = Arsenic Mitigation in West Bengal, India: New Hope for Millions | author = David Christiana | publisher = Southwest Hydrology | page = 32 | date = 2007-09-01 | accessdate = 2008-12-20}}</ref> Geographically, this area is divided into the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Terai and Doors region, and the North Bengal plains.<ref name=swhydro/> The Siliguri Corridor, also known as Chicken's Neck, which connects North-East India with rest of the India, lies in this region.

After India [[History of the Republic of India|gained independence]] in 1947, the province of Bengal was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partitioned]] along religious lines.
