==Communipaw-Lafayette==
Communipaw was part of [[Bergen City, New Jersey]]  during its brief incarnation between 1855-1870 before merging with [[Jersey City]], and was urbanized during the late half of the 19th century. Some streets of the neighborhood are part of the [[Communipaw-Lafayette Historic District]]. <ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/hpo/1identify/lists/hudson.pdf NJ State Register of Historic Places in Hudson County]</ref>Lafayette Park is likely named for the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who was stationed in Bergen in 1799,<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Jersey-City-History.html Battle with British]</ref> and later re-visited in 1824<ref>[http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/appletreehousejerseycity.shtml Aplple Tree House]</ref><ref>Harriet Phillips Eaton, Jersey City And Its Historic Sites, 1899:</ref><ref name="Grundy">{{cite book

===Lenape===
At the time of European settlement in the seventeenth century Communipaw was the site of the summer encampament and counsel fire of the [[Hackensack Indians]].<ref>Ruttenber,E.M.,Indian Tribes of Hudson's River, ISBN 0-910746-98-2 (Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001)</ref>a [[phratry]] of the [[Lenape]]. They, along with the [[Raritan (Native Americans)|Raritan]], [[Tappan (Native Americans)|Tappan]], [[Wecquaesgeek]], [[Canarsee]] and other groups who circulated in the region were collectively known as the [[River Indians]] by the immigrating population. 

It is likely that the name is based in the [[Algonquian language]] [[Lenape]]. Earlier spellings are numerous and have included ''Gamoenapa,''<ref>Ruttenber,E.M.,Indian Tribes of Hudson's River, ISBN 0-910746-98-2 (Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001) </ref>''Gemonepan,''<ref>Joan F.

===New Netherland===
[[Henry Hudson]], commissioned by the [[Dutch East India Company]], sailed along the shore at Communipaw in 1609 during his explorations of the [[Upper New York Bay]], [[North River]] and  [[Hudson Valley]].
<ref>http://www.jerseycityonline.com/jc_history.htm</ref>  On September 12th he sailed up to Communipaw, where Robert Juet, his mate, wrote in the log that it was "...a very good land to fall in with, and a pleasant land to see." <ref>[http://www.jerseycityonline.com/history_of_jersey_city.htm} JC Online]</ref> The [[New Netherland Company]] maintained a ''[[Factory (trading post)|factorij]]'', or trading post there during the 1610s.<ref>{{Cite journal

After the last British take-over of [[New Netherland]] in 1674 it became part of the [[Province of New Jersey]], in the county of [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], though it retained its [[Netherlands|Dutch]] character for hundreds of years. [[Washington Irving]] visited it often (at least once with future [[US president]] [[Martin van Buren]]) for inspiration. Writing in the early 1800s, he often referred to Communipaw as being the stronghold of traditional Dutch culture. <ref>http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Knickerbocker%27s_History_of_New_York/Book_II/Chapter_II</ref> [[John Quidor]], an American Romantic painter created works inspired the village: ''Embarkation from Communipaw'' and ''The Voyage from Communipaw to Hell Gate''.

Originally, the waters of the [[Upper New York Bay]] facing the village (situated near the site of today's [[Liberty Science Center]]) hosted vast [[oyster]] beds that were harvested well into the 19th century.  <ref>Kurlansky, Mark, ''The Big Oyster'', ISBN978-0-345-47639-5, Random House Trade paerpbacks, New York, 2006</ref>  As it was industrialized, first with the construction of ports and later with rail infrastructure, the shoreline was expanded with landfill, notably by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]. [[Communipaw Terminal]], officially known as the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey|Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal]], was the waterfront [[terminal station|terminus]]. The monument, along with the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island and Liberty Island]] recalls the period of massive emigration to the [[United States]]. The cove just to the south of the station is sometimes still called Communipaw Cove. The railroad also maintained a [[List of stations on the Central Railroad of New Jersey|Communipaw Station]] in the neighborhood farther inland <ref>List of stations on the Central Railroad of New Jersey.
