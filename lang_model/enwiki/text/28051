'''Demosthenes''' (384&ndash;322&nbsp;BC, ''[[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+0394><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>'') was a prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] statesman and [[orator]] of [[ancient Athens]]. His orations constitute the last significant expression of Athenian intellectual prowess and provide a thorough insight into the politics and culture of [[ancient Greece]]. He studied the masters of the oratorical art and delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of twenty, assaulting the guardians of his inheritance. Demosthenes made his living as a professional [[Logographer_%28legal%29|logographer]] and a lawyer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. At the same time he became more interested in politics.

In 351 BC, Demosthenes undertook his first political initiatives, devoting the most productive years of his career to restraining [[Macedon]]'s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against [[Philip II of Macedon]]. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon. He unsuccessfully tried to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the ancient [[Greece|Greek]] states. After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new King of Macedon, [[Alexander the Great]]. All his ventures again failed and his policy triggered Macedon's reaction. Thereby, Alexander's successor, [[Antipater]], sent his men to track him down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by Archias, Antipater's confidant.

The ''Alexandrian Canon'' compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] recognized Demosthenes as one of the 10 greatest orators and logographers. [[Cicero]] acclaimed him as "the perfect orator,"<ref name="Cic35"> Cicero, ''Brutus'', 35</ref> while [[Quintilian]] extolled him as "lex orandi" and underscored that "inter omnes unus excellat."<ref name="Q76"> Quintillian, ''Institutiones'', X, 1, 6 and 76</ref>

Demosthenes was orphaned at the age of seven.  Although his father provided well for him, his legal guardians, Aphobus, Demophon and Therippides, were accused of squandering his inheritance. As soon as Demosthenes came of age in 366 BC, he demanded the rendering of an account from the three legal guardians. According to the orator, the account revealed the misappropriation of large chunks of his property. Although his father left an estate of nearly fourteen [[Athenian Talent| talents]],<ref name="Aph4">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 1'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23875;layout=;loc=27.3 4]</ref> namely more than 3.150 golden [[Pound sterling| pounds]], Demosthenes predicated that the guardians had left nothing "except the house, and fourteen slaves and thirty silver minae (30 minae = 1/2 talent)".<ref name="Aph6">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 1'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23877;layout=;loc=27.5 6]</ref> At the age of 20, Demosthenes sued his trustees in order to recover his patrimony, beginning with Aphobus, followed by Demophon and Therippides.<ref name="AphIII6">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 3'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23970;layout=;loc=29.7 6]</ref> He delivered five orations himself: three ''Against Aphobus'' between 363 BC-362 BC and two ''Against Ontenor'' between 362 BC-361 BC.

Between his coming of age in 366 BC and the trials initiated in 364 BC, Demosthenes and his guardians engaged in a tough parley, which had no result, because both sides displayed no willingness for concessions.<ref name="Helios" /> At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. As an adolescent, his curiosity had been attracted by the orator [[Callistratus]], then at the height of his reputation, having won a cause of considerable importance.<ref name="Pl7">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 7</ref> According to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]<ref name="Nietzsche233-235">F. Nietzsche, ''Lessons of Rhetoric'', 233-235</ref> and [[Constantine Paparregopoulus|K. Paparrigopoulos]],<ref name="Paparrigopoulos396-398">K. Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Hellenic Nation'', Ab, 396-398</ref> Demosthenes was a student of [[Isocrates]]; Cicero and Quintillian maintain that Demosthenes was a student of [[Plato]]. [[Lucian]] includes [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]] and [[Xenocrates]] among his teachers.<ref name="Lucian1">Lucian, ''Demosthenes, An Encomium'', 12</ref>  These claims are nowadays disputed.{{Ref_label|B|<U+03B2>|none}} According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed [[Isaeus]] as his master in Rhetoric, though Isocrates was then teaching, either because he could not pay Isocrates the prescribed fee or because he preferred the style of Isaeus for his purpose, as being vigorous and astute.<ref name="Pl7" /> [[Ernst Curtius|Curtius]] likened the close and personal relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to "an intellectual armed alliance". <ref name="Jebb">R. C.

Jebb]], "some valuable hints Demosthenes unquestionably got from Isaeus ... but the limits of the influence forbid us to think that the intercourse between Isaeos and Demosthenes as teacher and learner can have been either very intimate or of very long duration".<ref name="Jebb" /> It is also believed that Isaeus helped Demosthenes edit his initial judicial orations against his guardians.<ref name="Tsatsos83">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 83</ref> Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian [[Thucydides]]. In the ''Illiterate Book-Fancier,'' Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in the orator's own handwriting.<ref name="Lucian2">Lucian, ''The Illiterate Book-Fancier'', 4</ref> Such legends hint at the orator's respect and admiration for a historian he must have assiduously studied.<ref name="Weil11">H. Weil, ''Bioraphy of Demothenes'', 10-11</ref>

According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], Demosthenes was married once and left behind him two sons. The only information about his wife, whose name is unknown, is that she was the daughter of Heliodorus, a principal citizen.<ref name="pseudo13">Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 13</ref> Demosthenes had also a daughter, "the first and only one who ever called him father", according to Aeschines' trenchant comment.<ref name="Ctesiphon77">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23457;layout=;loc=3.76 77]</ref> The girl died young and  unmarried a few days before Philip's death.<ref name="Ctesiphon77" />

===Career as logographer===
In order to make his living, Demosthenes became a professional logographer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits.  He was so successful that he soon acquired wealthy and powerful clients.

|-
| style="text-align: left;" | Demosthenes ('''''Third Philippic''', 69)

The Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, allowing him to serve personal interests, prejudicing the client. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents.<ref name="AischIII173">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23553;layout=;loc=3.172 173]</ref> He attacked his opponent, rhetorically querying: "And the born traitor--how shall we recognize him? Will he not imitate you, Demosthenes, in his treatment of those whom chance throws in his way and who have trusted him? Will he not take pay for writing speeches for them to deliver in the courts, and then reveal the contents of these speeches to their opponents?"<ref name="AischII165">Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002&query=section%3D%23361&layout=&loc=2.164 165]</ref> Aeschines also accused Demosthenes of writing a speech for Phormion, a wealthy banker, and then communicatting it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a capital charge against Phormion.<ref name="AischII165" /> Plutarch  supported this accusation, pointing out that Demosthenes "was thought to have acted dishonorably, for the speech which Phormion used against Apollodorus was also of his making; he, as it were, having simply furnished two adversaries out of the same shop with weapons to wound one another".<ref name="Pl15">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 15</ref>

==Early politics (354 BC-350 BC)==
===Speech training===
Even before he was 21 years of age in 363 BC, Demosthenes had already demonstrated an interest in politics. Then, in 363 BC, 359 BC and 357 BC, he undertook the function of the [[trierarch]], being responsible for the outfitting and maintenance of a [[trireme]]. In 350 BC, he became a [[choregos (ancient Greece)| choregos]], namely a grantor of a [[play]].

Although Demosthenes contended that he never plead in a single private case, <ref name="Zenothemis">Demosthenes, ''Against Zenothemis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0076;query=section%3D%2346;layout=;loc=32.31 32]</ref> it still remains unclear when and if Demosthenes abandoned the profit-making but less prestigious profession of the logographer.{{Ref_label|C|<U+03B3>|none}} According to Plutarch, when he first addressed himself to the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, "which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess."<ref name="Pl8">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 8</ref> Nonetheless, some citizens discerned his talent. When he first left [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)| ecclesia]] (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus upbraided him, saying that his diction was very much like that of [[Pericles]].<ref name="Pl9">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 9</ref> Another time ecclesia had refused to hear him and he was going home dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a familiar conversation with him."<ref name="Pl10">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 10</ref>

He also used to talk with pebbles in his mouth and recited verses while running. To strengthen his voice, he spoke on the seashore over the roar of the waves.]]
As a boy Demosthenes had suffered from a [[speech impediment]], an inarticulate and stammering pronunciation.<ref name="Britannica">''Encyclopedia Britannica''</ref> This is the reason Aeschinus taunted him and referred the nickname "Batalus", ostensibly invented by his own pedagogues<ref name="AischI126">Aeschines, ''Against Timarchus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23126;layout=;loc=1.127 126]</ref> or by the little boys with whom he was playing.<ref name="AischII99">Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0002:speech=2:section=99 99]</ref> According to Plutarch, he also had a weakness in his voice, "a perplexed and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking and disjointing his sentences much obscured the sense and meaning of what he spoke."<ref name="Pl8" /> Demosthenes soon undertook a disciplined program to overcome these shortcomings and improve his locution. He worked on his diction, his voice and his gestures.<ref name="Pl6">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 6 etc.</ref> His zeal and perseverance have passed into a proverb. It is, however, unknown whether these vignettes are factual accounts of events in Demosthenes's life or merely legendary examples of his perseverance and determination.<ref name="Helios" />

===Increased political activity===

Between 354 BC-350 BC Demosthenes continued in private law practice, while, at the same time, he became increasingly interested in public affairs. He mainly remained a judicial orator, but started involving himself in political cases. In 355 BC he wrote ''Against Androtion'' and a year later ''Against Leptines'', two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. The subject ''Against Timocrates'' and ''Against Aristocrates'' is the cracking down of corruption. Demosthenes denounced measures regarded as dishonest or unworthy of Athenian traditions.<ref name="Worthington29">I. Worthington, ''Demosthenes: Statesman and Orator'', 29</ref> All these speeches offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as the importance of the navy, of alliances and of the national honor.<ref name="Romilly116-117">J.

In 354 BC, Demosthenes delivered his first political oration, ''On the Navy''. The orator espoused moderation<ref name="Tsatsos88">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 88</ref> and proposed the reform of "symmories"(boards), a summary system funding the Athenian fleet.<ref name="Worthington29">I. Worthington, ''Demosthenes: Statesman and Orator'', 29</ref> In 352 BC he delivered ''For the Megalopolitans'' and a year later ''On the Liberty of the Rodians''. In both speeches, the orator opposed  [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], who was against any intervention in the internal affairs of the other Greek cities. 
Although none of his early orations was successful, Demosthenes imposed himself as an important political personality and broke with Eubulus' faction, a prominent member of which was Aeschines. He laid the foundations for his future political successes and for becoming the leader of his own party. His argumentation revealed his desire to articulate Athens' needs and interests.<ref name="Habinek21">T. N. Habinek, ''Ancient Rhetoric and Oratory'', 21</ref>  In 351 BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to undertake initiatives concerning the most important foreign affair of Athens: the stance his city should keep towards Philip II of Macedon. According to Jacqueline De Romilly, the threat of Philip would give his attitude a focus and a raison d'<U+00EA>tre.<ref name="Romilly116-117" /> From this point on, Demosthenes' career is virtually the history of Athenian foreign policy.<ref name="Britannica" />

[[Image:Philp.jpg|thumb|left|Ivory head of Philip II ([[Vergina]], [[Thessaloniki Archaeological Museum]]). Demosthenes saw the King of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities.]]
Most of Demosthenes' major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II. Since 357 BC, when Philip seized [[Amphipolis]], Athens was formally in a state of war against the [[Kings of Macedon|King of Macedon]]. In 352 BC Demosthenes characterized Philip as the very worst enemy of his city,<ref name="Arist121">Demosthenes, ''Against Aristocrates'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23426;layout=;loc=23.122 121]</ref> hinting at the ensuing fierce attacks against him.

The theme of the ''First Philippic'' (351 BC-350 BC) was preparedness and the reform of the theoric fund,{{Ref_label|D|<U+03B4>|none}} a mainstay of Eubulus' policy.<ref name="Romilly116-117" />.

From this moment and until 341 BC the orations of Demosthenes are all referred to the same issue, the struggle against Philip. In 349 BC Philip attacked [[Olynthus]], an ally of Athens at the time. In the three ''Olynthiacs'' Demosthenes criticized his compratiots for being idle<ref name="OlynthII23">Demosthenes, ''Second Olynthiac'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0070:speech=2:section=23 3]</ref>and urged Athens to help Olynthus<ref name="OlynthI3">Demosthenes, ''First Olynthiac'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0070;layout=;query=section%3D%232;loc=1.1 3]</ref>.

Demosthenes was among those who orientated themselves towards a compromise. In 348 another peculiar event occurred: [[Meidias]], a wealthy Athenian, slapped in public Demosthenes, who was at the time a choregos at the [[Dionysia|Greater Dionysia]]. Meidias was a friend of Eubulus and supporter of the unsuccessful excursion in Euboea.<ref name="Peace5" /> Demosthenes wrote the judicial oration [[Against Meidias]], which he probably never pronounced.

In 341 BC Demosthenes managed to draw [[Byzantium]] and [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] in an alliance with Athens, triggering Philip's hatred. The Athenians disallowed Philip's grievances and denounced the peace treaty, an action equivalent to an official declaration of war.

Athens formed an alliance, encompassing Euboea, [[Megara]], [[Achaea]], [[Corinth]] and [[Acarnania]]. Thebes, however, constituted the most desirable ally.

Philip inflicted a stringent punishment upon Thebes but was indulgent towards Athens. He actually proposed a new peace treaty, whose the terms were quite favorable for the defeated party.

In 336 BC Demosthenes celebrated Philip's assassination. According to Aeschines, "it was but the seventh day after the death of his daughter, and though the ceremonies of mourning were not yet completed, he put a garland on his head and white raiment on his body, and there he stood making thank-offerings, violating all decency".<ref name="Ctesiphon77" /> Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising and sent envoys to [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], an ostensible internal opponent of Alexander. Nonetheless, when the Athenians learned that Alexander whizzed to Boeotia, they panicked and begged the new King of Macedon for mercy. Alexander admonished them and imposed no punishment. The next year, Alexander engaged the Thracians and the Illyrians. While he was campaigning north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again, believing in the rumors that Alexander was dead. [[Darius III of Persia]] financed the Greek cities that rose up against Macedon and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300 talents on behalf of Athens and to have faced accusations of embezzlement.{{Ref_label|G|<U+03B6>|none}} Alexander razed, however, Thebes to the ground.

Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336 BC the orator Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honor Demosthenes for his services to the city. This proposal became a political issue and in 330 BC on legal irregularities Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon. In his most brilliant speech<ref name="Tsatsos301">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 301 and ''The Helios''</ref> ''On the Crown'' Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and attacked vehemently those who would have preferred peace with Macedon.

In 324 BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had entrusted huge treasures, had absconded and found refuge in Athens. Demosthenes at first gave advice to chase him out of the city.<ref name="Pl25">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 25</ref> Finally, Harpalus was imprisoned despite [[Hypereides]]' dissent.<ref name="Hypereides">Hypereides, ''Against Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0140%3Aspeech%3D5#anch4 1]</ref> Ecclesia after a proposal of Demosthenes decided the guarding of Harpalus' money, which were entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes himself.<ref name="Hypereides" /> When the committee counted the money, they found half the money Harpalus had declared he had.<ref name="Hypereides" /> Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit.

After Alexander's death in 323 BC Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to gain independence from Macedonian control in what is known as the [[Lamian War]]. Alexander's successor, Antipater, quelled, however, all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides among others. Following his request, ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian politicians to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of [[Poros| Calauria]], where he was later discovered by Archias, a confident of Antipater. The orator committed suicide before his capture. He took the poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his familly.<ref name="Pl29">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 29</ref> When Demosthenes perceived that the poison had pierced and seized his vitals, he said to Archias: "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of [[Creon]] in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." After he had thus spoken, he passed by the altar, he fell down and died.<ref name="Pl29" /> Years after Demosthenes' suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honor him and decreed nourishment to be given to his descendants in the [[Prytaneum]].<ref name="pseudo14">Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 14</ref>

Plutarch lauded Demosthenes for not being of a fickle disposition. Rebuting [[Theopompus]], the biographer insisted that for "the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose".<ref name="Pl15">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 15</ref> On the other hand, [[Polybius]] reprehended Demosthenes' policies. He accused him of having launched a bitter charge at the most illustrious Greeks, which would not deserve the name of traitor. The historian maintained that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, the only thing the Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. "And had it not been for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes."<ref name="Polybius">Polybius, ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Aid%3Db18c14 13]</ref>

K. Paparrigopoulos extolled Demosthenes' patriotism, but objurgated him as short-sighted. According to this critique, Demosthenes should have understood that the ancient Greek states could survive only unified under the leadership of Macedon.<ref name="Paparrigopoulos396-398" /> Therefore, Demosthenes is accused of misjudging events, opponents and opportunities and of being unable to foresee Philip's inevitable triumph.<ref name="Carey" /> He is criticized for having overrated Athens' capacity to revive and challenge Macedon.<ref name="Tsatsos318-326">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 318-326</ref> His city had lost most of his Aegean allies, whereas Philip had consolidated his hold over [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and was master of enormous mineral wealth. C. Carey concluded that Demosthenes was a better orator and political operator than strategist.<ref name="Carey" /> Nevertheless, the same scholar underscored that "pragmatists" like Aeschines or Phocion had no inspiring vision to rival that of Demosthenes. The orator asked the Athenians to choose that what is just and honorable, before their own safety and preservation.<ref name="Pl15" /> The people preferred Demosthenes' activism and even Chaeronea's defeat was regarded as a worth paying price in the attempt to retain freedom and influence.<ref name="Carey" /> According to A. W. Pickard, success may be an unworthy criterion to judge the actions of people like Demosthenes, who were dominated by the sentiment of political liberty.<ref name="Pickard">A.W.

De Romilly, ''A Short History of Greek Literature'', 121-122</ref>  

The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a hoplite indicates that he lacked any military skills. During this period of the Athenian history, almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent general. Demosthenes was no exception to the rule. This disproportion between his intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigor, stamina, military skill<ref name="Paparrigopoulos396-398" /> and strategic vision<ref name="Carey" /> is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue: 

:Had you for Greece been strong, as wise you were,
:The Macedonian had not conquered her.<ref name="Pl31">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 31</ref>

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] asserted that Demosthenes represents the final stage in the development of [[Attic]] prose. According to Dionysius, the orator joined the excellences of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal type style ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he excelled its special masters.<ref name="Dionysius46">Dionysius, ''On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes'', 46</ref> He is, therefore, regarded as a consummate adept in the techniques of oratory, which are fused in his work.<ref name="Romilly121-122" /> In his initial judicial orations, the influence of both [[Lysias]] and Isaeus is obvious <ref name="Tsatsos86">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 86</ref>, but his marked, original style is already revealed.<ref name="Jebb" />
Demosthenes' "affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when he does, it is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially in this, that his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit."<ref name="Thurston" /> Demosthenes was apt at combining abruptness with the exended period, brevity with breadth. Hence, his style harmonized the fervent traits of his commitment.<ref name="Romilly121-122" /> His language is simple and natural, never far-fetched or artificial. According to R.C. Jebb, Demosthenes was a true artist who could make his art obey him.<ref name="Jebb" /> For his part, Aeschines stigmatized his intensity, attributing to his rival strings of absurd and incoherent images.<ref name="Ctesiphon166">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002&query=section%3D%23546&layout=&loc=3.165 166]</ref> Dionysius underscored that Demosthenes' only shortcoming was the lack of humor,<ref name="Dionysius56">Dionysius, ''On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes'', 56</ref>, although Quintilian regarded this deficiency as a virtue.<ref name="Q2"> Quintillian, ''Institutiones'', VI, 3, 2</ref> The main criticism of Demosthenes' art, however, seems to have rested chiefly on his known reluctance to speak extempore,<ref name="Hermippos"> J. Bollansie, ''Hermippos of Smyrna'', 415</ref> He often declined to comment on subjects he had not studied beforehand.<ref name="Thurston" /> He gave the most elaborate preparation to all his speeches and, therefore, his arguments were the products of careful study.

{{cquote|The divine power seems originally to have designed Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities in their natural characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, and at the same time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.}}

During the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], Demosthenes had a reputation for eloquence.<ref name="Britannica" /> In [[modern history]], famous orators like [[Henry Clay]] would [[mimic]] Demosthenes' technique. His ideas and principles survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted a source of inspiration for the authors of the [[Federalist Papers|Federalist]] and for the major orators of the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="Tsatsos352">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 352</ref> [[Georges Clemenceau]] was among those who idealized the Athenian orator and wrote a book about him.<ref name="Marcu">V. Marcu, ''Men and Forces of Our Time'', 32</ref> For his part, Nietzsche was often composing his sentences according to the paradigms he found in Demosthenes,<ref name="Tongeren">P. J. M. Van Tongeren, ''Reinterpreting Modern Culture'', 92</ref> whose style he admired.<ref name="Beyond">F. Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', 247</ref> During the [[World War II]] the fighters of the [[French Resistance]] identified themselves with Demosthenes, while they gave [[Adolf Hitler]] the name of Philip. Thereby, the Athenian statesman was recognised as the symbol of independence and as a synonym of resistance against any tyrannical oppression.

Weil, ''Bioraphy of Demothenes'', 17</ref> maintain that Demosthenes never abandoned the profession of the logographer, but, after delivering his first political orations, he wanted to be regarded as a statesman. Thereby, he exercised less ostentatiously his duties as a lawyer. According to J. Murphy, his lifelong career as a logographer continued even during his most intense involvement in the political struggle against Philip.<ref name="Britannica" />

'''<U+03B4>.''' {{Note_label|D|<U+03B4>|none}} "Theorika" were allowances paid by the state to poor Athenians to enable them to watch dramatic festivals.

In one of his most vehement attacks against Demosthenes, Dinarchus raises the following query: "Will you not execute this accursed wretch, Athenians, who, in addition to many other crucial blunders, stood by while the Thebans' city was destroyed, though he had accepted three hundred talents from the Persian King for their protection ... ?"<ref name="Dinarchus" /> 

'''<U+03B7>.''' {{Note_label|H|<U+03B7>|none}} According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Demosthenes himself and others had again and again declared that assuredly the orator took no part of the money that Harpalus brought from Asia.<ref name="Pausanias">Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 2, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160;query=chapter%3D%2377;layout=;loc=2.34.1 33]</ref> He also narrates the following story: "Shortly after Harpalus ran away from Athens and crossed with a squadron to Crete, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him, though some assert that he was assassinated by Pausanias, a Macedonian. The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian, Philoxenus, who also had demanded Harpalus from the Athenians. Having this slave in his power, he proceeded to examine him, until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus. On obtaining this information he sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave a list of such as had taken a bribe from Harpalus, both their names and the sums each had received. Demosthenes, however, he never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him."<ref name="Pausanias" />On the other hand, Plutarch predicates that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a cup with twenty talents and that "Demosthenes could not resist the temptation, but admitting the present, like an armed garrison, into the citadel of his house, he surrendered himself up to the interest of Harpalus".<ref name="Pl25" />

'''<U+03B8>.''' {{Note_label|I|<U+03B8>|none}} F.Blass disputes the authorship of the following speeches: ''Fourth Philippic'', ''Funeral Oration'', ''Erotic Essay'', ''Against Stephanus 2'' and ''Against Evergus and Mnesibulus''.<ref name="Blass2">F.
