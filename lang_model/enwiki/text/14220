'''Baldr''' (modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] '''Baldur''', '''Balder''' is the name in modern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] and sometimes an [[Old Norse orthography|anglicized]] form) is, in [[Norse Mythology]], the god of innocence, beauty, joy, purity, and peace, and is [[Odin]]'s second son. His wife is called [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] and his son is called [[Forseti]]. Baldr had a ship, the largest ever built, named [[Hringhorni]], and a hall, called [[Breidablik]]. '''Phol''' may have been a German name for Baldr, based on the second [[Merseburg Incantations|Merseburg charm]], where the same person seems to be referred to as Phol and ''Balder''.

==The Prose Edda==
[[Image:Tripleurospermum perforatum 20041012 2572.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Matricaria perforata|Baldr's brow]].]]In the [[Gylfaginning]] section of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]] Baldr is described as follows.

:The second son of Odin is Baldr, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. [[Matricaria perforata|A certain herb]] is so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body. He is the wisest of the <U+00C6>sir, and the fairest-spoken and most gracious; and that quality attends him, that none may gainsay his judgments. He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be[.] - ''Brodeur's translation''

Apart from this gushing description Baldr is known primarily for the myth surrounding his death. His death is seen as the first in the chain of events which will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at [[Ragnarok]]. Baldr will be reborn in the new world, however, as foretold in the [[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]]. With this resurrection in mind, he is classified as a [[life-death-rebirth deity]].

[[Image:Balder.jpg|thumb|right|Due to perceived similarities, Baldr is sometimes associated with Christ in art{{fact|date=February 2007}}, as is clearly emphasized in this illustration of ''[[Baldrs draumar]]'' (1893).]]

He had a dream of his own death (or his mother had the same dreams). Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, and his mother [[Frigg]] made every object on earth [[vow]] never to hurt Baldr. All but one, an insignificant weed called the [[mistletoe]], made this vow. Frigg had thought it too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow (alternatively, it seemed too young to swear). When [[Loki]], the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god [[H<U+00F6><U+00F0>r]], who then inadvertently killed his brother with it. For this act, Odin and the giantess [[Rindr]] gave birth to V<U+00E1>li who grew to adulthood within a day and slew H<U+00F6><U+00F0>r.

Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship, Hringhorni, the largest of all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant [[Vafthruthnir]] (and which was, of course, unanswerable) in the [[Vafthruthnismal]] (the riddle also appears in the riddles of [[Gestumblindi]] in [[Hervarar saga]]). The dwarf [[Litr]] was kicked by [[Thor]] into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await the end of Ragnarok when she would be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by [[Hyrrokin]], a [[giantess]], who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.

Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger [[Herm<U+00F3><U+00F0>r|Hermod]], [[Hel (goddess)|Hel]] promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. And all did, except a [[giantess]], [[<U+00DE><U+00F6>kk]], who refused to mourn the slain god. And thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarok, when he and his brother H<U+00F6><U+00F0>r would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.

When the gods discovered that the [[giantess]] had been [[Loki]] in disguise, they hunted him down and bound him to three rocks. Then they tied a serpent above him, the venom of which dripped onto his face. His wife [[Sigyn]] gathered the venom in a bowl, but from time to time she had to turn away to empty it, at which point the poison would drip onto Loki, who writhed in pain, thus causing earthquakes. He would free himself, however, in time to attack the gods at Ragnarok.

==The Poetic Edda==
[[Image:Loki and Hod.jpg|thumb|right|[[Loki]] tricks [[H<U+00F6><U+00F0>r]] into shooting Baldr.]]

In the [[Elder Edda]] the tragic tale of Baldr is hinted at rather than told at length. Among the visions which the Norse Sibyl sees and describes in the weird prophecy known as the [[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]] is one of the fatal mistletoe.  Yet looking far into the future the Sibyl sees a brighter vision of a new heaven and a new earth, where the fields unsown shall yield their increase and all sorrows shall be healed; then Baldr will come back to dwell in Odin's mansions of bliss, in a hall brighter than the sun, shingled with gold, where the righteous shall live in joy for ever more.

==Gesta Danorum==
Writing about the end of the [[12th century]], the old Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] tells the story of Balder in a form which professes to be historical. According to him, '''Balderus''' and '''H<U+00F8>therus''' were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of Norway. Now Balderus was a demigod and common steel could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the rest of the gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and H<U+00F8>therus married the princess. Nevertheless Balderus took heart of grace and again met H<U+00F8>therus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. H<U+00F8>therus dealt him a deadly wound with a [[magic sword]], which he had received from Miming, the satyr of the woods; and after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.

==Chronicon Lethrense and Annales Lundenses==
There are also two less known Danish Latin chronicles, the ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' and the ''Annales Lundenses'' of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] account of H<U+00F6><U+00F0>r's slaying of Baldr.

It relates that Hother was the king of the [[Saxons]] and son of [[Hothbrodd|Hothbrod]] and the daughter of [[Hadding]]. Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods.

==Beowulf==
In [[Beowulf]] the Baldr-story appears featuring he [[geatish]] prince [[Herebeald]] in the place of Baldr, who is killed by his brother [[H<U+00E6><U+00FE>cyn]] ([[H<U+00F6><U+00F0>r]]). The king [[Hre<U+00F0>el]] replaces [[Odin]] as the grieving father.

==Merseburg Incantations==
The [[Merseburg Incantations]] feature Balder and Nanna (here termed "Sinhtgunt") in an ancient
spell for horse healing.

==Baldr in place names==
There are few old place names in Scandinavia that contains the name ''Baldr''. The most certain and notable one is the (former) parishname [[Balleshol]] in Hedmark county, Norway: "a Balldrshole" 1356 (where the last element is ''h<U+00F3>ll'' m "mound; small hill"). Others may be (in [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] forms) ''Baldrsberg'' in Vestfold county, ''Baldrsheimr'' in Hordaland county ''Baldrsnes'' in S<U+00F8>r-Tr<U+00F8>ndelag county - and (very uncertain) the fjord and municipality [[Balsfjord]] in Troms county.

==Analogues==
The legendary death of Baldr resembles the legendary death of the [[Iran|Persian]] hero [[Esfandyar]] in the epic [[Shahnameh]]. In Finnish mythology, [[Lemmink<U+00E4>inen]] shares just the same kind of fate as Baldr: to be killed by a blind one at the feast of gods. Baldr has also been likened to [[Jesus]], as [[C. S. Lewis]] did when he said he "loved Balder before Christ" (''Surprised by Joy''). Baldr, a god of light, shares some of Jesus' traits as a youthful [[Life-death-rebirth deity|"dying and rising" god]], who returns after [[Ragnarok]], the end of the world (comparable to the Christian [[Apocalypse]]) to usher in a new era of peace.

==Baldr's brows==
In [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]], the ''[[Matricaria perforata|Scentless Mayweed]]'' (''[[Matricaria perforata]]'') is named ''Baldr's brows'' because of its whiteness.
