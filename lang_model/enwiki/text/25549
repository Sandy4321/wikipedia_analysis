Slayer are known for their distinctive musical traits, involving fast [[tremolo picking]], [[guitar solo]]s, [[Double-bass drum#Double bass|double bass drumming]], and screaming vocals. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as [[serial killers]], [[satanism]], [[religion]], [[War|warfare]] and the [[Holocaust]] have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public.

Since their debut record in 1983, the band has released two [[live album]]s, one [[box set]], and ten [[studio album]]s, selling over four million albums in the United States. The band has received two Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "[[Eyes of the Insane]]", and headlined music festivals worldwide, including [[Ozzfest]] and the [[Download Festival]].

==History==
===''Early days'' (1981<U+2013>1982)===
Slayer formed in 1981, when guitarist Kerry King met Jeff Hanneman auditioning for a band. The two recruited bassist and vocalist [[Tom Araya]], who had played with King in a band called ''Quits'', and drummer [[Dave Lombardo]], who met King delivering pizzas.<ref name="Drummerworld - Dave Lombardo"/> The band began playing [[cover version]]s of [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]] songs at clubs and parties in [[Southern California]]. Early shows relied on a [[Satanism|satanic]] image, featuring pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses.<ref name="All Music Guide Biography of Slayer"/>

In 1982, Slayer recorded their first demo &mdash; a rehearsal featuring the songs "Fight Till Death"({{audio| Fight Till Death 83 demo clip.ogg|sample}}), "Black Magic" and "The Antichrist".<ref name="Rockdetector Biography - Years 81 to 84">{{cite web|title=Rockdetector Biography - Years 81 to 84|author=Sharpe-Young, Garry|publisher=Rockdetector.com|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,8188.sm|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref> The demo was widely traded in the 1980s underground tape trading scene and the band were offered to open for Bitch at the ''Woodstock Club'' in [[Los Angeles]]. While performing "[[The Phantom of the Opera (adaptations)#Music|Phantom of the Opera]]" the band was spotted by [[Brian Slagel]], a former music journalist who had recently founded [[Metal Blade Records]]. Slagel convinced the band to record an original song, "Aggressive Perfector"({{audio|Aggressive Perfector clip.ogg|sample}}) for his upcoming ''Metal Massacre III'' compilation, released in July 1983. The song created underground buzz, which led to Slagel offering the band a recording contract.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web|title = INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL|author = German, Eric|publisher = Metalupdate.com|url = http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewmetalblade.html|accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

===''Show No Mercy'' (1983<U+2013>1984)===
Without a recording budget, the band was forced to self-finance their debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who was employed as a [[respiratory therapist]],<ref name="Live Chat with Tom Araya of Slayer">{{cite web

[[Image:Slayer - Show No Mercy.jpg|left|thumb|Slayer's ''Show No Mercy'', 1983]]
''[[Show No Mercy]]'', released in December 1983 by [[Metal Blade Records]], generated underground popularity for the band. Slayer began their first national club tour in 1984 to promote the album, traveling in Araya's [[Camaro]] towing a [[U-Haul]] trailer.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The tour gave the band additional popularity; sales of ''Show no Mercy'' reached more than 20,000 in the US.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL"/>

In August 1984, Slayer released a four song [[extended play|EP]], entitled ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]''. The EP featured a darker, more [[thrash metal|thrash]]-oriented style than its predecessor, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band.<ref name="Slayer : Haunting the Chapel">{{cite web|title=Slayer:Haunting the Chapel|author=Rivadavia, Ed|publisher=All Music Guide|url = http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,164341,00.html|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> The opening track, "Chemical Warfare," has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984. After the release of ''Haunting the Chapel'', Slayer made their live European debut in 1985 at the ''Heavy Sounds Festival'' in [[Belgium]] opening for [[UFO (band)|UFO]],<ref name="SLAYER - Jeff Hanneman">{{cite web|title=SLAYER - Jeff Hanneman|author=Lahtinen, Lexi|publisher=Metal-rules.com|date=[[2006-12-18]]|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=737&Itemid=60|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> returning to the US to begin the ''Haunting North America'' 1985 tour. Following the tour, King temporarily left Slayer to join [[Dave Mustaine]]'s new band [[Megadeth]].<ref name="Megadeth History">{{cite web|title = Megadeth History|publisher = Megadeth.com|url =http://www.megadeth.com/index.php?section=history|accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref> Hanneman was worried about King's decision, stating in an interview "I guess we<U+2019>re gonna get a new guitar player".<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> While Mustaine wanted King to stay on a permanent basis, King rejoined Slayer after five shows, stating Megadeth was "taking too much of my time".<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two bands.<ref name="cocksucker">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=32802 |title="Slayer's Kerry King Says Dave Mustaine Is 'A Cocksucker'" - Feb. 12, 2005|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate = October 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Following King's return, the band embarked on the ''1984 Combat Tour'', with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], and released the ''[[Live Undead]]'' EP in November. Although the record label indicates the EP was "live in concert", it was recorded in a New York recording studio, with fans brought in to provide crowd noise.<ref name="Rockdetector Biography - Years 81 to 84"/>

===''Hell Awaits'' (1985<U+2013>1986)===
Slayer released their first live [[home video]] in 1985, dubbed ''Combat Tour: The Ultimate Revenge''. The video featured live footage filmed at [[New York]]'s [[Studio 54]] club, on the band's 1984 tour with Venom and Exodus. After the videos release, ''Show No Mercy'' had sold over 40,000 copies,<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL"/> which lead to the band returning to the studio to record their second full length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, allowing the band to hire producer [[Ron Fair]].<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Released in September 1985, Slayer's second full length release ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' expanded on the darkness of ''Haunting the Chapel'', with [[hell]] and [[Satan]] as common song subjects. The album was the band's most [[progressive rock|progressive]] offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The intro is a backwards recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating "Join us," ending with "Welcome back" before the track begins. The album was a hit, with fans choosing Slayer for best band, best live band, ''Hell Awaits'' as 1985's best album, and Dave Lombardo as best drummer in the [[United Kingdom|British]] magazine ''Metal Forces''' 1985 Readers Poll.<ref name="Rockdetector Biography - Years 85 to 86">{{cite web|title=Rockdetector Biography - Years 85 to 86|author = Sharpe-Young, Garry|publisher = Rockdetector.com|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,8189.sm|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref>

===''Reign in Blood'' (1986<U+2013>1987)===
Following the success of ''Hell Awaits'', Slayer were offered a recording contract with [[Rick Rubin]]'s newly founded [[Def Jam Records]], a largely [[hip hop music|rap]]-based label.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> With an experienced producer and [[major label]] recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on ''Hell Awaits'', ditched in favor of stripped down, [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] influenced song structures.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>
[[Image:Reign in blood.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Reign in Blood]]'', 1986]]

Def Jam's distributor, [[Columbia Records]] refused to release ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', due to its controversial graphic cover art and lyrical themes.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> "Angel Of Death",({{audio| Angel of Death clip.ogg|sample}}) detailed the [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s and [[human experiments]] conducted by Nazi doctor [[Josef Mengele]].

===''South of Heaven'' (1988<U+2013>1989)===
Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album.  To contrast the speed of ''Reign in Blood'', the band consciously decided to slow down the tempo incorporating melodic singing, rather than screaming.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> As a result, 1988's ''[[South of Heaven]]'' received criticism from longtime fans, although the album was Slayer's most commercially successful release at the time, debuting at #57 on the Billboard 200,<ref name="Billboard"> Billboard.com ''"Artist Chart History"'', at [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5692&model.vnuAlbumId=789249 Billboard.com]; last accessed [[December 13]], [[2006]].</ref> and second  to be certified gold in the US.<ref name="RIAA"> RIAA.com ''"Recording Industry Association of America Gold & Platinum Searchable Database"'', at [http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp RIAA.com]; last accessed [[December 13]], [[2006]].</ref> Press response to the album was mixed, with ''[[All Music Guide]]'' citing the album as "disturbing and powerful",<ref name="South of Heaven">{{cite web|title=South of Heaven|author=Henderson, Alex |publisher=Allmusicguide.com|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:oaq67uy0h0jf|accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling the album "genuinely offensive satanic drivel".<ref name="Slayer -  Album Reviews">{{cite web|title=Slayer - Album Reviews|author=Neely, Kim|publisher=[[Rolling stone]]|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/slayer/albums/album/128851/review/5943269/south_of_heaven|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>  ''South of Heaven'' featured a [[cover version]] of [[Judas Priest]]'s "Dissident Aggressor", the band's first cover song released on a studio album.  

In 1988 Slayer embarked on the ''World Sacrifice Tour'' with openers [[Nuclear Assault]], and in the summer were added as special guests on Judas Priest's ''[[Ram it Down]]'' tour.<ref name="Rockdetector Biography - Years 85 to 86"/>  Following nearly six years of constant touring, the band took time off in 1988.

===''Seasons in the Abyss'' (1990<U+2013>1993)===
Slayer returned to the studio with co-producer [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] in 1989, to record their fifth studio album. Following the backlash created by ''South of Heaven'', Slayer returned to the "pounding speed of ''Reign in Blood''", while retaining their new found melodic sense.<ref name=AMGSeasons>Huey, Steve.

Slayer returned as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European ''Clash of the Titans'' tour with [[Megadeth]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak, the tour was extended to the US beginning in May 1991, with Megadeth, [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]] and opening act [[Alice in Chains]]. The band recorded a double live album, ''[[Decade of Aggression]]'' in 1991, to celebrate ten years - the compilation debuting at #55 on the Billboard 200.<ref name="Billboard"/>

"Their downtuned rhythms, infectious guitar licks, graphically violent lyrics and grisly artwork set the standard for dozens of emerging thrash bands, and Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal" states [[MTV]], ranking Slayer as the sixth "greatest metal band of all time".<ref name="Why They Rule - #6 Slayer">{{cite web|title=Why They Rule - #6 Slayer|publisher=[[MTV]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml|accessdate =2006-01-18}}</ref>

When writing new material, the band will write the music before the lyrics. King or Hanneman, who uses a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] and [[drum machine]] will show band members the riff, to see what they think; either King or Hanneman and Lombardo will mention if any alterations can be made.
