The following is the '''complete [[discography]] of official releases by [[The Get Up Kids]]'''. The Get Up Kids are an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band that formed in 1995 in [[Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. Shortly after forming, the band signed to [[Doghouse Records]] and released their first EP, [[Woodson (EP)|Woodson]] along with their debut full-length album [[Four Minute Mile]] in 1997. After the success of their first album, the band was picked up by then-underground label [[Vagrant Records]], where they recorded [[Red Letter Day (EP)|Red Letter Day]], their second EP, followed by their sophomore album [[Something to Write Home About]]. The album was massively successful, making Vagrant Records one of the top labels in the country. They supported the album for three years with tours and two singles, "''[[Ten Minutes]]''" and "''[[Action & Action]]''". In order to capitalize on the success of the album, Vagrant released [[Eudora (album)|Eudora]], a compilation of B-Sides, covers and rarities in 2001. The following year, they released their third studio album [[On a Wire]]. The album was a large departure from their previous sound, and was considered a commercial failure. In 2004, they released their fourth album [[Guilt Show]] to better critical reception. A year later, they released [[Live! @ The Granada Theater]], the band's first and only live album. Later that year, the band broke up after one final tour. However, in 2008 the band reunited, and announced a reunion tour for 2009 to coincide with a tenth-anniversary re-release of their second album.
