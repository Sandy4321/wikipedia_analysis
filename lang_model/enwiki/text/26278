'''George Stanley McGovern''' (born July 19, 1922) is a historian, former United States [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]], [[United States Senate|Senator]], and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|presidential]] nominee. McGovern lost the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] in a landslide to [[Richard Nixon]]. As a decorated World War II combat veteran, McGovern was known for his opposition to the Vietnam War.

Appointed in 1961 by U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] as the worldwide director of the [[Food for Peace]] program, he remained a longtime leader in ensuring nutrition and food security as a means to fight poverty and political instability.  McGovern was appointed [[United Nations]] Ambassador on World Hunger in 2001. In 2008, he and Senator [[Bob Dole]] were named the 2008 [[World Food Prize]] Laureates for their work to promote school-feeding programs globally.

Soon thereafter McGovern was sworn in as a [[Private (rank)|private]] at [[Fort Snelling]] in [[Minnesota]].<ref name="ambrose-49">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 49.</ref>  He spent a month at [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post]] in [[Missouri]] and then five months at [[Southern Illinois Normal University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]] for ground school training; both the academic work and physical training would be the toughest he would ever experience.<ref name="ambrose-56">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 54, 56<U+2013>57.</ref>  He spent two months at a base in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and then went to [[Hatbox Field]] in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] for basic flying school in a single-engined [[PT-19]].<ref name="ambrose-56"/>  Lonely and in love, McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943, while on three-day leave in a ceremony at the small Methodist church in Woonsocket with his father presiding, as the couple decided not to wait any further.<ref name="ambrose-65">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 65<U+2013>66.</ref><ref name="terry-43">McGovern, ''Terry'', p. 43.</ref>  After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to [[Coffeyville Army Airfield]] in [[Kansas]] for three months of training on the [[BT-13]].<ref name="ambrose-68">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 68<U+2013>70, 73<U+2013>74.</ref>  Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at [[Pampa Army Airfield]] in [[Texas]] for twin-engine training on the [[Cessna AT-17|AT-17]] and [[Curtiss AT-9|AT-9]].<ref name="ambrose-68"/>  Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good [[depth perception]] aiding him.<ref name="ambrose-56"/>  Eleanor McGovern followed him to these different stops and was there when he got his wings and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|Second Lieutenant]].<ref name="ambrose-68"/>

McGovern was assigned to [[Liberal Army Airfield]] in Kansas to transition school to learn to fly the [[B-24 Liberator]], an assignment he was pleased with.<ref name="ambrose-68"/>  McGovern recalled later: "Learning how to fly the B-24 was the toughest part of the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because in the early part of the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was like at the controls. It was the biggest bomber we had at the time."<ref name="airjourn"/>  Eleanor was constantly afraid of her husband suffering an accident while training, which claimed a huge toll of airmen during the entire war.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 68, 72, 100.</ref>  This was followed by a stint at [[Lincoln Army Airfield]] in [[Nebraska]], where McGovern met his B-24 crew.<ref name="ambrose-96">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 94, 96, 99.</ref>  The traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds was a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation.<ref name="ambrose-96"/>  The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others due to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 115.</ref>  Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child and Eleanor became pregnant.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 87<U+2013>88.</ref>  In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at [[Mountain Home Army Air Field]] in [[Idaho]].<ref name="ambrose-96"/>  They then shipped out via [[Camp Patrick Henry]] in [[Virginia]], where McGovern found history books to fill downtime, and overseas on a slow troopship.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 102<U+2013>104.</ref>

[[File:15th AF B-24 Liberator.jpg|thumb|right|A B-24 Liberator of the Fifteenth Air Force's 451st Bombardment Group (not McGovern's group, but also stationed in Italy), on a March 1945 mission over Germany]]
In September 1944, McGovern joined the 741st Squadron of the [[455th Bombardment Group]] of the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], stationed at [[San Giovanni Airfield]] nearby [[Cerignola]] in the [[Apulia]] region of Italy.<ref name="ambrose-124">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 124, 128<U+2013>130.</ref>  There he and his crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression.<ref name="ambrose-124"/><ref name="nyt-prof-1968"/>  Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35 missions over enemy territory from there, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the ''[[Dakota Queen]]'' after his wife Eleanor.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 153.</ref>  His targets were in Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Germany, Hungary, Poland, and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either [[oil refinery]] complexes or rail [[marshalling yard]]s, all as part of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|U.S. strategic bombing campaign in Europe]].  The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by then, his missions often faced heavy [[anti-aircraft artillery]] fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.

On McGovern's December 15 mission over [[Linz]], his second as pilot, a piece of shrapnel from flak came through the windshield and missed killing him by only a few inches.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 179<U+2013>180.</ref>  The following day on a mission to [[Br<U+00FC>x]] he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 181.</ref>  The day after that he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 187<U+2013>189.</ref>  On a December 20 mission against the [[<U+0160>koda Works]] at [[Plze<U+0148>|Pilsen]], McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak.  Unable to return to Italy, McGovern was able to land his plane on a British airfield on [[Vis (island)|Vis]], a small island off the Yugoslav coast controlled by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisan (military)|Partisans]].  The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, killed many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there, but McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew and earning him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref name="ambrose-192">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 192<U+2013>196.</ref><ref name="1000-176">Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 176.</ref>

In January 1945, McGovern used [[R&R (military)|R&R]] time to see every sight he could in Rome and participate in an [[audience with the Pope]].<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 202<U+2013>206.</ref>  Bad weather prevented many missions from happening during the winter, and during downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about.  He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 186, 190.</ref>  In February, McGovern was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]].<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', p. 219.</ref>  On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farm when a jammed bomb accidentally released above it and destroyed it, which McGovern felt guilty about.<ref name="ambrose-228">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 228<U+2013>233.</ref>  (Decades later, after a public appearance in that country, the owner of that farm came to the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident, but no one was hurt and felt it was worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in some small way.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 262<U+2013>263.</ref>)  On return from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier.<ref name="ambrose-228"/>  April 25 saw McGovern's 35th mission, to fulfill the USAAF limit for combat, against heavily defended Linz.  The sky turned black and red with flak <U+2013> McGovern later said "Hell can't be any worse than that" <U+2013> the ''Dakota Queen'' was hit multiple times (producing 110 holes in its fuselage and wings) and the hydraulic system was knocked out.  McGovern's waist gunner was injured and his flight engineer so terrified that he would be hospitalized with [[battle fatigue]], but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.<ref name="1000-176"/><ref name="ambrose-240">Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 240<U+2013>245.</ref>

In May and June 1945, following the end of the European war, McGovern flew food relief flights to northern Italy, then flew back to the United States with his crew.<ref>Ambrose, ''The Wild Blue'', pp. 254<U+2013>256, 258.</ref>  McGovern was discharged from the Army Air Forces in July 1945, with the rank of First Lieutenant.<ref name="cby-265"/>  He was also awarded the [[Air Medal]] with three [[oak leaf cluster]]s,<ref name="nyt-mitn-61"/> one instance of which was for the safe landing on his final mission.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 43.</ref>

==Later education and early career==
Upon coming home, McGovern returned to Dakota Wesleyan University, aided by the [[G.I. Bill]], and graduated from there in June 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]''.<ref name="cby-265"/><ref name="anson-50">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 50<U+2013>53.</ref>  For a while he suffered from nightmares about flying through flak barrages or his plane being on fire.<ref>E.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
[[File:George McGovern bioguide.jpg|thumb|right|George S. McGovern, date uncertain]]
In 1956, McGovern sought elective office himself, and ran for the House of Representatives from [[South Dakota's 1st congressional district]], which consisted of the counties east of the [[Missouri River]].<ref name="cby-266"/>  He faced four-term incumbent Republican Party Representative [[Harold O.

Entering the [[85th United States Congress]], McGovern became a member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|House Committee on Education and Labor]].<ref name="cby-266"/>  As a representative, McGovern was attentive to his district.<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/>  He became a staunch supporter of higher commodity prices,<ref name="nyt-record"/> farm price supports, grain storage programs, and beef import controls,<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/> believing that such stored commodities programs guarded against drought and similar emergencies.<ref name="nyt-mitn-61"/> He favored rural development, federal aid to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security.<ref name="cby-266"/><ref name="nyt-record"/>  In 1957, he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under a fellowship from the [[American Christian Palestine Committee]].<ref name="cby-266"/>  McGovern first allied with the [[Kennedy family]] by supporting a House version of Senator John F.

In his 1958 reelection campaign, McGovern faced a strong challenge from South Dakota's two-term Republican Governor and World War II [[Medal of Honor]] winner [[Joe Foss]],<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/> who was initially considered the favorite to win.<ref name="anson-87">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 87<U+2013>90.</ref>  But McGovern ran an effective campaign and was the

In the [[86th United States Congress]], McGovern was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Committee on Agriculture]].<ref name="cby-266"/>  The longtime chair of the committee, [[Harold D.

==Food for Peace director==
[[File:JFKennedy GeorgeMcGovern.jpg|thumb|right|McGovern as Food for Peace director in 1961, with President John F. Kennedy]]
Having relinquished his House seat to run for the Senate, McGovern was available for a position in the new [[Kennedy administration]].<ref group="nb">McGovern first indicated his interest in becoming [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], and gained the backing of some farm groups as well as the support of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. The president-elect wanted to appoint him, but others felt that McGovern at age 38 lacked sufficient seniority. By the time of Kennedy's selection, McGovern was happy with the lesser position of Food for Peace director, as he had come to realize that Secretary of Agriculture was usually a difficult job and a dead end for political careers. See Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 98<U+2013>101, and Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 144.</ref>  McGovern was picked to become a Special Assistant to the President and first director of Kennedy's high-priority Food for Peace program, which realized what McGovern had been advocating in the House.<ref name="cby-266"/>  McGovern assumed the post on January 21, 1961.<ref name="jfk-let"/>

As director, McGovern urged the greater use of food to enable foreign economic development, saying "We should thank God that we have a food abundance and use the over-supply among the under-privileged at home and abroad."<ref name="nyt-mitn-61"/>  He found space for the program in the [[Old Executive Office Building|Executive Office Building]] rather than be subservient to either the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]] or [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].<ref>Schlesinger, ''A Thousand Days'', p. 170.</ref>  McGovern worked with deputy director [[James W. Symington]] and Kennedy advisor [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] in visiting South America to discuss surplus grain distribution, and attended meetings of the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].<ref name="cby-266"/> In June 1961, McGovern became seriously ill with [[hepatitis]], contracted from an infected White House dispensary needle used to give him inoculations for his South American trip; he was hospitalized and out of action for two months.<ref name="anson-110">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 110<U+2013>113.</ref>

By the close of 1961, the Food for Peace program was operating in a dozen countries<ref name="cby-266"/> and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before.<ref name="anson-110"/>  In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded [[school lunch]] program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one of five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it.<ref name="anson-110"/>  [[Pope John XXIII]] praised McGovern's work during an audience in Rome,<ref name="anson-110"/> and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers.<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/>  Administration was never McGovern's strength, however, and he was restless for another try at the Senate.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 116.</ref>  With the approval of President Kennedy, McGovern resigned his post on July 18, 1962.<ref name="cby-266"/><ref name="jfk-let"/> Kennedy said that under McGovern the program had "become a vital force in the world", improving living conditions and economies of allies and creating "a powerful barrier to the spread of Communism".<ref name="jfk-let">{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8773 | title=Letter Accepting Resignation of George McGovern as Director of the food for Peace Program | author=[[John F.

==U.S. Senator==
===1962 election and early years as a senator===
In April 1962, McGovern announced he would [[United States Senate elections, 1962|run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat]], intending to face incumbent Republican [[Francis H. Case]].<ref name="cby-266"/>  Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor [[Joseph H. Bottum]].<ref name="cby-266"/>  Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its [[New Frontier]];<ref name="cby-267">''Current Year Biography 1967'', p. 267.</ref> Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat.<ref name="nyt102062">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00F1FF73958137A93C2AB178BD95F468685F9 | title=McGovern Wages Uphill Battle in Senate Race in South Dakota | author=Janson, Donald | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 20, 1962 | page=9 | format=fee required}}</ref> McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|Farmers Union]].<ref name="nyt102062"/> Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign.<ref name="nyt102062"/>  (During this hospitalization, McGovern read [[Theodore H. White]]'s classic ''[[The Making of the President, 1960]]'' and for the first time began thinking about running for the office someday.<ref name="white-1972-40"/>)  Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may well have saved his chances.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. ix, 125.</ref>  The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years<ref name="cby-267"/> and only the third since statehood in 1889.<ref name="nyt102062"/>

When he joined the Senate in January 1963 for the [[88th Congress]], McGovern was seated on the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee]].<ref name="cby-267"/>  On the Agriculture Committee, McGovern supported high farm prices, full parity, and controls on beef importation, as well as the administration's [[Feed Grains Acreage Diversion Program]].<ref name="anson-135">Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 135.</ref>  McGovern had a fractious relationship with Secretary of Agriculture [[Orville Freeman]], who was less sympathetic to farmers; McGovern's 1966 resolution to informally scold Freeman made the senator popular back in his home state.<ref name="anson-135"/>  Fellow new senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] saw McGovern as a serious voice on farm policy and often sought McGovern's guidance on agriculture-related votes.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/us/28senate.html | title=Senate Has Changed in Kennedy's Time | author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 27, 2009}}</ref>  McGovern was largely inactive on the Interior Committee until 1967, when he was given chair of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs.<ref name="anson-144">Anson, McGovern, pp. 143<U+2013>144.</ref>  However, Interior chair [[Henry M. Jackson]], who did not get along with McGovern personally or politically, refused to allow McGovern his own staff, greatly limiting his effectiveness.<ref name="anson-144"/>  McGovern regretted not accomplishing more for South Dakota's 30,000 [[Sioux Indian]]s, although after a McGovern-introduced resolution on Indian self-determination passed in 1969, the [[Oglala Sioux]] named McGovern "Great White Eagle".<ref name="anson-144"/>

In his first speech on the Senate floor in March 1963, McGovern praised Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]] initiative, but spoke out against [[Cuba <U+2013> United States relations|U.S. policy towards Cuba]], saying that it suffered from "our Castro fixation".<ref name="cby-267"/>  In August 1963, McGovern advocated reducing the $53 billion [[Military budget of the United States|defense budget]] by $5 billion; influenced by advisor [[Seymour Melman]], he held a special antipathy towards the doctrine of [[Overkill#Nuclear weapons|nuclear "overkill"]].<ref name="anson-130">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 129<U+2013>131.</ref>  McGovern would try to reduce defense appropriations or limit military expenditures in almost every year during the 1960s.<ref name="anson-133">Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 133.</ref>  He also voted against many weapons programs, especially missile and anti-missile systems, and also opposed military assistance to foreign nations.<ref name="anson-133"/>  In 1964, McGovern published his first book, ''War Against Want: America's Food for Peace Program''.<ref name="cby-267"/>  In it he argued for expanding his old program, and a Senate measure he introduced was eventually passed, adding $700 million to the effort's funding.<ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', p. 136.</ref>

Preferring to focus on broad policy matters and speeches, McGovern was not a master of Senate legislative tactics, and developed a reputation among some other senators for "not doing his homework".<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/><ref name="anson-138">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 138<U+2013>139.</ref>  Described as "a very private, unchummy guy", he was not a member of the Senate "club" nor did he want to be, turning down in 1969 a chance to join the powerful [[Senate Rules Committee]].<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/><ref name="anson-138"/>  Relatively few pieces of legislation would bear his name and his legislative accomplishments were generally viewed as modest, although he would try to influence the contents of others' bills.<ref name="nyt-record"/><ref name="anson-138"/>  In terms of ideology, McGovern fit squarely within [[modern American liberalism]]; through 1967 his ADA senate score was 92, and when unbriefed on a particular matter, he would ask his staff, "What are the liberals doing?"<ref name="nyt-prof-1968"/><ref name="nyt-record"/><ref>Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 139<U+2013>141.</ref>

===Opposition to Vietnam War===
[[File:George McGovern Vietnam trip Nov 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Senator McGovern on his first trip to South Vietnam, November 1965]]
In a speech on the Senate floor in September 1963, McGovern became the first member to challenge the [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Under the Kennedy Administration|growing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam]].<ref name="anson-150"/><ref name="weil-16">Weil, ''The Long Shot'', pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref>  Bothered by the [[Buddhist crisis]] and other recent developments, and with concerns influenced by Vietnam historian [[Bernard Fall]], McGovern said:
{{cquote|The current dilemma in Vietnam is a clear demonstration of the limitations of military power. ... [Current U.S. involvement] is a policy of moral debacle and political defeat. ... The trap we have fallen into there will haunt us in every corner of this revolutionary world if we do not properly appraise its lessons."<ref name="nyt-record"/><ref name="anson-150">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 149<U+2013>151.</ref>}}

However, the speech was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from saying anything publicly for over a year afterward, partly because of the November 1963 [[assassination of President Kennedy]] and partly to not appear strident.<ref name="anson-152">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 152<U+2013>154.</ref>  Though more skeptical about it than most senators,<ref name="mann-366">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', pp. 357, 366<U+2013>368.</ref> McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which turned out to be an essentially unbounded authorization for President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to escalate U.S. involvement in the war.<ref name="nyt-record"/>  McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack;<ref name="weil-16"/> subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator [[J. William Fulbright]]'s urging to stand behind Johnson politically.<ref name="anson-152"/><ref name="mann-366"/>  Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war;<ref name="nyt-record"/> [[Wayne Morse]], one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of "very interesting, but very belated".<ref name="anson-152"/>  This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.<ref name="weil-16"/><ref name="mann-366"/>

In January 1965, McGovern made his first major address on Vietnam, saying that "We are not winning in South Vietnam. ... I am very much opposed to the policy, now gaining support in Washington, of extending the war to the north."<ref name="cby-267"/><ref name="anson-155">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 154<U+2013>157.</ref> McGovern instead proposed a five-point plan advocating a negotiated settlement involving a federated Vietnam with local autonomy and a UN presence to guarantee security and fair treatment.<ref name="anson-155"/>  The speech gave McGovern national visibility as one of the "doves" in the debate over Vietnam.<ref name="anson-155"/>  However, McGovern made moderate-to-hawkish statements at times too, flatly rejecting unconditional withdrawal of U.S. forces and criticizing [[Opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War#The draft|anti-war draft card burnings]] as "immature, impractical, and illegal".<ref name="anson-160">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 160<U+2013>164.</ref> In November 1965, McGovern travelled to South Vietnam for three weeks.<ref name="mann-486">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 486.</ref>  The human carnage he saw in hospital wards deeply upset him, and he became increasingly outspoken about the war upon his return, more convinced than ever that Vietnam was a political not military problem.<ref name="nyt-record"/><ref name="cby-267"/><ref name="anson-160"/>  Now he was ready, as he later said, "not merely to dissent, but to crusade" against the war.<ref name="mann-486"/>

McGovern voted in favor of Vietnam military appropriations in 1966 through 1968, not wanting to deprive U.S. forces of necessary equipment.<ref name="anson-160"/> Nevertheless, his anti-war rhetoric increased throughout 1967.<ref name="anson-165">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 165<U+2013>166.</ref>  Over the years, Johnson had invited McGovern and other Senate doves to the [[White House]] for attempts to explain the rationale for his actions in Vietnam; McGovern came away from the final such visit, in August 1967, shaken by the sight of a president "tortured and confused ... by the mess he has gotten into in Vietnam."<ref name="anson-165"/>

===1968 presidential and senate campaigns===
In August 1967, activist [[Allard K. Lowenstein]] founded the [[Dump Johnson movement]], and soon they were seeking a Democratic Party figure to make a primaries campaign challenge against Johnson in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]].<ref name="white-1968-72">White, ''The Making of the President 1968'', pp. 72<U+2013>74.</ref>  Their first choice was Senator Robert  Kennedy, who declined, as did another, and by late September 1967 they approached McGovern.<ref name="nyt-prof-1968"/><ref name="white-1968-72"/>  After much deliberation McGovern declined, largely because he feared such a run would significantly damage his own chances for reelection to his Senate seat in 1968.<ref name="nyt-mitn-72"/><ref name="anson-4"/>  A month later the anti-Johnson forces were able to convince Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] to run,<ref name="white-1968-72"/> who was one of the few "dove" senators not up for reelection that year.<ref name="anson-4">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 2<U+2013>8.</ref>

The 1968 Democratic primaries unfolded with McCarthy staging a strong showing and Robert Kennedy entering, followed by Johnson withdrawing and Vice President Humphrey running instead.  While McGovern favored Kennedy privately, McCarthy and Humphrey were from a neighboring state and publicly McGovern remained neutral throughout.<ref name="anson-188">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 188<U+2013>192.</ref>  McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 5 South Dakota Democratic primary, which resulted in a strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night.<ref name="anson-188"/>  McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before [[Robert F.

{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}
But most of all, McGovern was known for his continued opposition to the Vietnam War.  In March 1969, he became the first senator to explicitly criticize the new president's policy there, an action that was seen as a breach of customary protocol by other Senate doves.<ref name="anson-168">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 167<U+2013>169.</ref>  By the end of 1969, McGovern was calling for an immediate cease-fire and a total withdrawal of all American troops within a year.<ref name="anson-168"/> In October 1969, McGovern was a featured speaker before 100,000 demonstrators in Boston at the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]], and in November he spoke before 350,000 at Moratorium/[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|Mobilization]]'s anti-war march to the [[Washington Monument]].<ref name="anson-172">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 169<U+2013>174.</ref>  Afterward, he decided that radicalized peace demonstrations were counterproductive and criticized anti-war figures such as [[Rennie Davis]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[Huey Newton]], [[Abby Hoffman]], and [[Jerry Rubin]] as "reckless" and "irresponsible".<ref name="anson-172"/> 

Instead, McGovern focused on legislative means to bring the war to an end.<ref name="anson-177"/>  The [[McGovern<U+2013>Hatfield Amendment]] to the annual military procurement bill, co-sponsored by Republican [[Mark Hatfield]] of Oregon, required via funding cutoff a complete withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina by the end of 1970.<ref name="nyt090270">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0B1FF73D551B7493C0A91782D85F448785F9 | title=Senate Defeats 'End War' Move By Vote Of 55<U+2013>39 | author=Smith, Robert M. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 2, 1970 | page=1 | format=fee required}}</ref> It underwent months of public discussion and alterations to make it acceptable to more senators, including pushing the deadline out to the end of 1971.<ref name="mann-669"/>  In May 1970, McGovern obtained a [[second mortgage]] on his Washington home in order to fund a half-hour televised panel discussion on the amendment on [[NBC]].<ref name="mann-669"/> The broadcast brought in over $500,000 in donations that furthered work on passage,<ref name="anson-177"/> and eventually the amendment gained the support of the majority of the public in polls.<ref name="mann-669"/>  The effort was denounced by opposition groups organized by White House aide [[Charles Colson]], which called McGovern and Hatfield "apostles of retreat and defeat" and "salesmen of surrender" and maintained that only the president could conduct foreign policy.<ref name="mann-669"/> The amendment was defeated in September 1970 by a 55<U+2013>39 vote, just short of what McGovern had hoped would constitute at least a [[moral victory]].<ref name="anson-177">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 174<U+2013>178.</ref>  During the floor debate McGovern criticized his colleagues opposing the measure:

There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. And if we do not end this damnable war those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the Executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us.<ref name="anson-177"/><ref name="mann-669"/>}}

==1972 Presidential campaign==
{{Main|George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972}}
{{See also|United States presidential election, 1972}}
[[Front-runner]] [[Edmund Muskie]] did worse than expected in the New Hampshire primary and McGovern came in a close second. While Muskie's campaign funding and support dried up, McGovern picked up valuable momentum in the following months. [[Gary Hart]], who became a presidential contender 12 years later, was McGovern's campaign manager and future president Bill Clinton (with assistance from his future wife Hillary Rodham) managed the McGovern campaign's operations in Texas.  Despite losing several primaries, including losing Florida to [[George Wallace]], McGovern secured enough delegates to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] to win the party's nomination.

McGovern ran on a [[political platform|platform]] that advocated withdrawal from the Vietnam War in exchange for the return of American [[prisoners of war]]<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 122.</ref> and amnesty for draft evaders who had left the country.<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 337.</ref>

McGovern's platform also included an across-the-board, 37% reduction in defense spending over three years;<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 123.</ref> and a "demogrant" program (later dropped from the platform) that would replace the personal income tax exemption with a $1,000 tax credit as a minimum-income floor for every citizen in America,<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 125.</ref> to replace the welfare bureaucracy and complicated maze of existing public-assistance programs.  Its concept (a conservative one) was similar to the [[negative income tax]] long advocated by economist Milton Friedman, and by the Nixon Administration in the form of the Family Assistance Program, which called for a minimum family grant of $1,600 per year, later raised to $2,400.  The personal income tax exemption later became $1000 under President Reagan.  (As Senator, McGovern had previously sponsored a bill, submitted by the National Welfare Rights Organization, for $6,500 [[guaranteed minimum income]] per year to families, based on need.)<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 190.</ref> In addition, McGovern supported ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].

McGovern became tagged with the label "amnesty, abortion and acid", supposedly reflecting his positions.<ref group="nb">The label's origins later turned out to come from Thomas Eagleton, several months before he became the vice presidential nominee.  See [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19694666/page/7/ Meet the Press Transcript for July 15, 2007. "Interview with Robert Novak] and [http://www.columbiatribune.com/2007/Aug/20070819Feat004.asp Columbia Tribune. "A slice of history: Biographers of the late U.S. Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri will find some vivid anecdotes when they comb through his large collection of journals, letters and transcripts housed in Columbia" by Terry Ganey. August 19, 2007]</ref>

Just over two weeks after the 1972 Democratic Convention, it was revealed that McGovern's running mate, [[Thomas Eagleton]], had received [[electroshock therapy]] for [[clinical depression]] during the 1960s. McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry's battles with mental illness.<ref name="terry-review"/> Though many people still supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and columnists questioned his ability to handle the office of Vice President. The resulting negative attention prompted McGovern to accept Eagleton's offer to withdraw from the ticket. Five prominent Democrats publicly turned down McGovern's offer of the VP slot. Finally he was able to name [[United States Ambassador to France]] [[Sargent Shriver]], a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. This occurred after McGovern had stated publicly he was still "... behind Eagleton [[1000 percent]]"; reneging on that statement a few days later made McGovern look indecisive. The Eagleton controversy also put the McGovern campaign off message and was speculated at the time to perhaps be a harbinger of what would become McGovern's subsequent landslide loss.<ref>White (1973); Giglio (2009)</ref>

The McGovern Commission changes to the convention rules marginalized the influence of establishment Democratic figures (some of whom had lost the nomination to McGovern). Many refused to support him, with some switching their support to the incumbent President Nixon through a campaign effort called "[[Democrats for Nixon]]". In addition, McGovern was repeatedly attacked by associates of Nixon, including the infamous [[Watergate burglaries|Watergate break-in]], which eventually led to Nixon's resignation in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|author=Julian Borger |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1165126,00.html |title=Who is Karl Rove? &#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= March 9, 2004|accessdate=2010-06-17 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=James Ridgeway |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0529,ridgeway,66005,6.html |title=> news > Mondo Washington: Grime Pays by James Ridgeway |publisher=village voice |date=2005-07-12 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

An infamous incident took place late in the campaign. McGovern was giving a speech and a Nixon admirer kept heckling him. McGovern called the young man over and whispered in his ear, "Listen, you son-of-a-bitch, why don't you kiss my ass?"  The heckler confirmed the exchange when asked by a journalist, and the remark was widely reported.  By the following night, "KMA" buttons were being worn by people in the crowds at McGovern rallies.  Several years later, McGovern observed [[Mississippi]] Senator [[James Eastland]] looking at him from across the Senate floor and chuckling to himself.  He subsequently approached McGovern and asked, "Did you really tell that guy in '72 to kiss your ass?"  When McGovern smiled and nodded, Eastland replied, "That was the best line in the campaign."<ref>{{cite book|title=Presidential Campaigns|first=Paul|last=Boller|year=2004|page=340|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fZ_fSmFIabQC|accessdate=August 1, 2009 | isbn=9780195167160 | publisher=Oxford University Press US}}</ref>  McGovern later wrote, "I don't know whether the incident won or lost me votes.  It probably did both...  Some staff members frantically insisted that I issue a denial or retraction immediately.  I did no such thing.  I went to bed and slept soundly."

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|general election]], the McGovern/Shriver ticket suffered a 61%-37% defeat to Nixon<U+2013> at the time, the second biggest landslide in American history, with [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] totals of 520 to 17. McGovern's two electoral vote victories came in [[Massachusetts]] and Washington, D.C.; McGovern failed to win his home state of South Dakota, a state that had delivered for the Democrats in only three of the previous 18 presidential elections in the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Leip |url=http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/index.html |title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

One of the most memorable of the failings of McGovern's campaign was that, at the Democratic Convention, McGovern delivered his speech ("Come home America!") at 3 in the morning, reaching an audience of probably less than one million.  This was supposedly the result of McGovern either repaying favors or yielding to pressure to give more than a dozen interest groups what were supposed to be two or three minutes of face time on network TV.  Most of these special interest speakers ignored time limits, with the result that McGovern spoke to a more-than-half-empty auditorium

After this loss, McGovern remained in the Senate.  He was scarred by the enormous defeat,<ref name="miroff-293">Miroff, ''The Liberals' Moment'', p. 293.</ref> and wife Eleanor took it even worse; during the winter of 1972<U+2013>1973 the couple seriously considered moving to England.<ref name="nytm-mcginniss"/>  On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, he gave a speech at the [[Oxford Union]] beginning with the words, "Delighted as I am to be here, I had hoped to be engaged elsewhere this evening ..." which a largely student audience greeted with laughter and applause.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  In order to get past the "bitterness and self-pity" he felt, McGovern continued to force himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 [[Gridiron Dinner]], he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, "For many years, I wanted to run for the Presidency in the worst possible way <U+2013> and last year I sure did."<ref name="nytm-mcginniss"/><ref>Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 710.</ref>  Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the [[Watergate scandal]].

==Later activities==
During the 1980s, McGovern was a fellow at the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] think tank in Washington.<ref name="nyt-innkeeper"/> 

McGovern had made several real estate investments in the D.C. area and became interested in hotel operations.<ref name="nyt-innkeeper"/> In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], with the goal of providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility.<ref name="nyt-innkeeper"/><ref name="nrw-piece">{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n38_v26/ai_12685435/?tag=rel.res1 | title=A Politician's Dream <U+2013> A Businessman's Nightmare | author=McGovern, George | newspaper=[[Nation's Restaurant News]] | date=September 21, 1992}}</ref>  It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/style/chronicle-558491.html | title=Chronicle | author=Anderson, Susan Heller | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 14, 1991}}</ref>  In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and the ''[[Nation's Restaurant News]]''.<ref name="nrw-piece"/><ref>{{cite news | title=A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare | author=McGovern, George | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=June 1, 1992}}</ref>  He attributed part of the failure to the [[early 1990s recession]], but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits.<ref name="nrw-piece"/>  McGovern wrote, "I ... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day.

During early 1991, McGovern publicly explored another presidential run, [[United States presidential election, 1992|for the 1992 contest]], as President [[George H. W.

During this period, McGovern was the president of the Middle East Policy Council, a non-profit organization that seeks to educate American citizens and policy makers about the political, economic and security issues impacting U.S. national interests in the Middle East. He held this position from 1991 until December 1997 when he was replaced by Charles W. Freeman, Jr..

In January 2008, McGovern wrote an op-ed in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' calling for the impeachment of President [[George W.

By 2009, McGovern had moved to [[St. Augustine Beach, Florida]] as a new seasonal resident, citing the history and beauty of the area (and warm climate) as his reasons for becoming a "snowbird" there.
Later that year, McGovern donated $1 million to historic renovations of the [[Harry S.

As Chairman of the Democratic Party's [[Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection]] in 1969-1970, McGovern helped institute major changes in Democratic party rules that continue to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well.

He remains a symbol, or standard-bearer, of the [[political left]], particularly in relation to the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s when the country was torn by U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and the corruption and abuse of power of the Nixon administration. McGovern recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, "I opened the doors of the Democratic Party and 20 million people walked out."<ref name="nytm-mcginniss"/><ref>Jonah Goldberg, [http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzViZWNhOTk2ZTY3YzRmYjU3NjU4YWY0ODg1M2FjNjY= "Nedrenaline Rush"] August 11, 2006 ''[[National Review]]''</ref>  McGovern has also become more forceful in recent years in drawing historical parallels between the Nixon and Bush administrations and the Vietnam and Iraq wars.<ref name="ap102906"/>  McGovern's post-political career has generally enhanced his reputation; [[Tom Brokaw]] wrote in 1998 that "He remains one of the country's most decent and thoughtful public servants."<ref name="brokaw-121"/>

McGovern's legacy also includes a commitment to combating hunger both in the United States and around the globe. In addition to numerous domestic programs or legislation, including those regarding nutrition and food stamps, he collaborated with former Senator [[Bob Dole]] (R-Kansas) in creating an international school lunch program through The George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (since 2000), which helps fight child hunger and poverty by providing nutritious meals to children in schools in developing countries. This program has since led to greatly increased global interest in and support for school-feeding programs - which benefit girls and young women, in particular - and won McGovern and Dole the 2008 World Food Prize.
