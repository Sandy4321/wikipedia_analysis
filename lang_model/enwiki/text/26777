'''Tony Kushner''' (born July 16, 1956) is an American [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]]. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1992 for his play, ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes]]'', and co-authored with [[Eric Roth]] the screenplay for the 2005 film, ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]''.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Kushner was born in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]] to [[Jewish]] [[clarinetist]] and conductor William Kushner and Sylvia Deutscher, a [[bassoonist]]. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], the seat of [[Calcasieu Parish]] where he spent his childhood. During high school Kushner had a reputation in policy debate, at one point going to a camp, and making it to the final rounds. Kushner moved to New York in 1974 to begin his undergraduate college education at [[Columbia University]], where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Medieval Studies in 1978. He studied directing at [[New York University]]'s Graduate School, from which he was graduated in 1984. During graduate school, he spent the summers of 1978-1981 directing both early original works (Masque of Owls and Incidents and Occurrences During the Travels of the Tailor Max) and Shakespearean plays ([[A Midsummer Night's Dream]] and [[The Tempest]]) for the children attending the Governor's Program for Gifted Children (GPGC) in Lake Charles. In 2008, he received a [[Honorary Degree]] of [[Doctor of Letters]] from [[SUNY Purchase]] College.<ref>http://www.purchase.edu/AboutPurchase/NewsAndEvents/pressreleasedetails.aspx?newsid=131</ref>

''[[Angels in America]]'' is a play in two parts. The first part is entitled ''Millennium Approaches,'' and the second is entitled ''Perestroika''. Kushner's other plays include ''Hydriotaphia'', ''Slavs!: Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness'', ''[[A Bright Room Called Day]]'', ''Homebody/Kabul'', and the book for the musical ''[[Caroline, or Change]]''. His new translation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' was performed at the Delacorte Theater in the summer of 2006 starring [[Meryl Streep]] and directed by [[George C. Wolfe]]. Kushner has also adapted [[S. Ansky]]'s play ''[[The Dybbuk]]''.

Kushner has moved into cinema on late.  His co-written screenplay ''[[Munich]]'' was produced and directed by Steve Spielberg in 2005. In January 2006, a documentary feature about Kushner entitled ''Wrestling With Angels'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was directed by [[Freida Lee Mock]]. He is currently working with Spielberg again, writing the screenplay for a new movie about the complex icon Abraham Lincoln.

=== Kushner's style ===
Kushner's plays and screenplays are often a departure from typical Realism, experimenting with conventional storytelling by using shorter episodes.  
For example, the ''[[Angels in America]]'' plays together contain almost 50 scenes. His condensed, heightened dialogue compacts the action into impacting, concise bursts. He still proves effective in a more traditional, "long form" structure; three of the acts in ''[[Perestroika]]'' are long, single scenes. He is not afraid of spectacle - extraordinary moments that stay on target, not simply for show. Again in ''[[Angels]]'', we witness a midnight appearance from an angel, and a frightening daytime appearance of a Biblical harbinger of revelation. The play ''[[A Bright Room Called Day]]'', and his 1990 adaptation of Pierre Cornielle's ''[[The Illusion]]'' are primarily in verse, showing an almost Shakespearean love of poetry. Still, his subjects remain current, and like [[Henrik Ibsen]], creates stories which give rise to social discussion, instead being simply "issue plays."

=== Political views===
In an interview with the ''Jewish Independent'', Kushner insisted that "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for a [[one-state solution]], which is not true." However, he later stated that he hopes that "there might be a merging of the two countries because [they're] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map," although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.<ref name=JewishIndependent<ref name=JewishIndependent>{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/Aug07/archives07Aug24-01.html|date=August 24, 2007 |title=Tony Kushner as film subject|author=Cynthia Ramsey|publisher=Jewish Independent}}</ref>

Kushner's criticism of Israeli treatment of Palestinians and of the increase in religious extremism within Israeli politics and culture has created some controversy in the Jewish community, including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement of Brandeis University. The Zionist Organization of America unsuccessfully lobbied for the university to rescind its invitation to Kushner. In the course of the controversy, quotes critical of Zionism and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner said at the time that his quotes were "grossly mischaracterized." Kushner told the ''Jewish Advocate'' in an interview "All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am."<ref>Shayndi Raice.

Kushner and long term partner, Mark Harris, an editor of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and author of "Pictures at a Revolution - Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood" celebrated their wedding ceremony in April 2003.<ref name=vows>{{cite news | author=Lois Smith Brady | title=Weddings/Celebrations: Vows; Mark Harris and Tony Kushner | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E5DE143CF937A35756C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | date=4 May 2003 | accessdate=2008-12-21}}</ref>
