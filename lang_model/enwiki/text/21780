The '''Ganges Delta''' (also '''Sunderban Delta''' or the '''Bengal Delta''') is a [[river delta]] in the South Asia region of [[Bengal]], consisting of [[Bangladesh]] and the state of [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. It is the world's largest delta, and empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. It is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname '''The Green Delta'''. The delta, also known as the '''Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta''', stretches from the [[Hooghli River]] on the west to the [[Meghna River]] on the east. It is approximately 350km (220 miles) across at the Bay of Bengal. [[Kolkata]] (formerly Calcutta) and [[Haldia]] in India and [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] in Bangladesh are the principal seaports on the delta. 

The Ganges Delta arises from the confluence of the following rivers:
* [[Padma River|Padma (Lower Ganges)]] (''P<U+00F4>dda'')
* [[Jamuna River|Jamuna (Lower Brahmaputra)]] (''Jomuna'')
* [[Meghna]]

==Shape and composition==
The Ganges delta has the shape of a triangle, and is considered to be an "arcuate"  delta (arc-shaped). 
It covers more than 105,000 km<U+00B2> (40,540 mi<U+00B2>), and although the delta lies mostly in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], rivers from [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]] drain into it from the north. Approximately two-thirds of the delta is in Bangladesh. Most of the delta is composed of [[alluvial]] soils, with red and red-yellow [[laterite]] soils found as one heads farther east. The soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients, which is good for agriculture.

It is composed of a [[labyrinth]] of [[waterway]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[lake]]s and flood plain sediments (Chars). The Ganges delta is separated into two parts: the eastern (active), and the western (less active) part.

==Population==
Between 125 and 143 million people live on the delta, despite risks from [[flood]]s caused by [[monsoon]]s, heavy runoff from the melting snows of the [[Himalayas]], and tropical [[cyclone]]s. A large part of the nation of Bangladesh lies in the Ganges Delta, and many of the country's people depend on the delta for survival.

It is believed that upwards of 300 million people are supported by the Ganges Delta, and approximately 400 million people live in the Ganges River Basin, making it the most populous river basin in the world. Most of the Ganges Delta has a population density of more than 200 people per km<U+00B2> (520 people per square mile), making it one of the most densely populated regions on earth.

==Agriculture and fishing==
Approximately two-thirds of the Bangladesh people work in agriculture, and grow crops on the fertile floodplains of the delta. The major crops that are grown in the Ganges Delta are [[jute]], [[tea]], and [[rice]]. Fishing is also an important activity in the delta region, with fish being a major source of food for many of the people in the area.

In recent years, scientists have been helping the poor people of the delta to improve fish farming methods. By turning unused ponds into viable fish farms, and improving methods of raising fish in existing ponds, many people can now earn a living raising and selling fish. Using new systems, fish production in existing ponds has increased 800%. Shrimp and salmon are farmed in containers or cages that are submerged in open water<U+2014>most of these fish are exported.

==Cyclones and flooding==
In November 1970, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century  hit the Ganges Delta region. The [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] killed 500,000 people (official death toll), with another 100,000 missing. The [[The Guinness Book of World Records]] estimated the total loss of human life from the Bhola cyclone at 1,000,000 - [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53274]

Another cyclone hit the delta in 1991, killing about 138,000 people<U+2014>see [[1991 Bangladesh Cyclone]].

People have to be careful building on the river delta as severe flooding also occurs. In 1998, the Ganges flooded the delta, killing about 1,000 people and leaving more than 30 million people homeless. The Bangladesh government asked for $900 million to help feed the people of the region, as the entire [[rice]] crop was lost.

==Climate==
The Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet [[climate]] zone, and receives between 1500mm to 2000mm (60 and 80 inches) of [[rainfall]] each year in the western part, and 2000mm to 3000mm (80-120 inches) in the eastern part. The coolest month of the year, on average, is January, with April and May being the warmest months. Average temperatures in January range from 14<U+00B0>C to 25<U+00B0>C (57 to 77 <U+00B0>F), and average temperatures in April range from 25<U+00B0>C to 35<U+00B0>C (77 to 95 <U+00B0>F).
July is the wettest month, on average, when over 330mm (13 inches) of rain falls on the delta (temperature averages from Kolkata).

==Flora and fauna==
Three [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s cover the delta. The [[Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests]] ecoregion covers most of the delta region, although the forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture and only small enclaves remain. Thick stands of tall grass, known as canebrakes, grow in wetter areas. The [[Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests]] ecoregion lies closer to the Bay of Bengal; this ecoregion is flooded with slightly [[brackish]] water during the dry season, and fresh water during the monsoon season. These forests, too, have been almost completely converted to intensive agriculture, with only {{convert|130|km2|sqmi}} of the ecoregion's {{convert|14600|km2|sqmi}} protected. Where the delta meets the Bay of Bengal, [[Sundarbans mangroves]] form the world's largest [[mangrove]] ecoregion, covering an area of {{convert|20400|km2|sqmi}} in a chain of 54 islands. They derive their name from the predominant mangrove species, ''[[Heritiera]] fomes'', which are known locally as ''sundri'' or ''sundari''.

Animals in the delta include the Indian Python (''[[Python molurus]]''), Clouded Leopard (''Neofelis nebulosa'') , [[Indian Elephant]] (''Elephas maximus indicus'') and [[crocodile]]s, which live in the Sundarbans. Approximately 1,020 endangered [[Bengal tiger]]s (''Panthera tigris tigris'') are believed to inhabit the Sundarbans.

It is estimated that 30,000 [[chital]] (''Axis axis'') are in the Sundarbans part of the delta. Birds found in the delta include [[kingfisher]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[woodpecker]]s, the shalik (''[[Common Myna|Acridotheres tristis]]''), the [[Swamp Francolin]] (''Francolinus gularis''), and the doel (''[[Oriental Magpie Robin|Copsychus saularis]]''). Two species of [[dolphin]] can be found in the delta: the [[Irrawaddy Dolphin]] (''Orcaella brevirostris'')  and the [[Ganges and Indus River Dolphin|Ganges River Dolphin]] (''Platanista gangetica gangetica''). The Irrawaddy Dolphin is an [[oceanic dolphin]] that enters the delta from the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges River Dolphin is a true [[river dolphin]], but is extremely rare and considered [[endangered]].

Trees found in the delta include sundari, garjan (''[[Rhizophora]]'' spp.), [[bamboo]], mangrove palm ''([[Nypa fruticans]])'', and mangrove date palm (''[[Phoenix paludosa]]'').

==Future of delta==
One of the greatest challenges people living on the Ganges Delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising [[sea level]]s caused mostly by [[subsidence]]  in the region and partly by [[climate change]].  An increase of half a meter could result in six million people losing their homes in Bangladesh. Higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta, because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the Himalayas{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Important gas reserves have been discovered in the delta, which could play a major role in the future of the region, and hopefully help lift many of the poor people living in the delta out of poverty. Several major oil companies have invested in exploration of the Ganges delta region.
