'''Richard Wesley Hamming''' (February 11, 1915 &ndash; January 7, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] whose work had many implications for [[computer science]] and [[telecommunications]]. His contributions include the [[Hamming code]] (which makes use of a [[Hamming matrix]]), the [[Hamming window#Hamming window|Hamming window]] (described in Section 5.8 of his book ''Digital Filters''), [[Hamming numbers]], [[sphere-packing]] (or [[hamming bound]]) and the [[Hamming distance]].

[[File:Hamming.jpg|thumb|left|A two-dimensional visualisation<br>of the [[Hamming distance]]]]
He received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1937, a master's degree from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1939, and finally a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1942.  He was a professor at the [[University of Louisville]] during [[World War II]], and left to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1945, programming one of the earliest electronic digital computers to calculate the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists.   The objective of the program was to discover if the detonation of an [[atomic bomb]] would ignite the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamming|first=Richard|title=Mathematics on a Distant Planet|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|year=1998|month=Aug - Sep|volume=105|issue=7|pages=640<U+2013>650|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2589247}}</ref> The result of the computation was that this would not occur, and so the [[United States]] used the bomb, first in a test in [[New Mexico]], and then twice against [[Japan]].
Later, from 1946 to 1976, he worked at the [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], where he collaborated with [[Claude E. Shannon]]. During this period, he was an [[Adjunct Professor]] at the [[City College of New York]], School of Engineering.
On July 23, 1976 he moved to the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], where he worked as an [[Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] until 1997,
when he became [[Professor Emeritus]]. He died a year later in 1998.

He was a founder and president of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. His philosophy on scientific computing appears as preface to his 1962 book on numerical methods: ''The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.''

*:Unconventional introductory textbook which attempts to both teach calculus and give some idea of what it is good for at the same time.

*:Entertaining and instructive.  Hamming tries to extract general lessons<U+2014>both personal and technical <U+2013> to aid one in having a successful technical career by telling stories from his own experiences.
*:(Some of this material relating to the self-management of one's technical career can be found online in ''You and Your Research,'' {{Harv|Hamming|1986}}.)
*:One of Hamming's lessons is never trust without question someone who claims to be giving you highly accurate data to analyze <U+2013> not because they're deliberately lying to you but because the data is never as accurate as people think.

* Hamming discusses the use and potential of computers in the 1965 film ''Logic By Machine''.
