'''Father Mangunwijaya''', also as '''Yusuf Bilyarta Mangunwijaya''' ([[Ambarawa]], [[Central Java]], 6 May  1929 - [[Jakarta]] 10 February 1999), was an Indonesian architect, writer, and Catholic religious leader. He was fondly known as '''Romo Mangun''' (Father Mangun).

==Biography==
He was the son of Yulianus Sumadi and Serafin Kamdaniyah.  At the age of sixteen, during the revolution for independence from the Dutch, he joined the Student Army. The troops' callousness towards the villagers shocked him. In 1950, after hearing a speech by Major Isman about the harmful effects of the revolution on civilians, he decided to repay his debt by serving the people as a priest. He was ordained as a priest in 1959, and studied in Philosophy and Theological at ''Institute Sancti Pauli'' in [[Yogyakarta]]. He continued to study [[architecture]] in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]], and [[Institute of Humanistic Studies]], Aspen, Colorado. 

He created many literary works, such as Ikan-ikan Hiu, Ido, Homa, Roro Mendut, Durga/Umayi, and Burung-Burung Manyar, and also many other essays and non-fiction works. His literary fiction '''Burung-Burung Manyar''' (The Weaver Birds) received [[Ramon Magsaysay]] Award in 1996. 

He was known as the father of modern [[Indonesian architecture]]. He received [[Aga Khan Award]] in 1992 for his work with the slum dwellers on the banks of the Code river in [[Yogyakarta]].

His disappointment with [[Education in Indonesia|Indonesian education system]] triggered him to explore alternative education systems. He founded the Elementary Education Dynamics Foundation, as well as exploratory elementary school project for the victims of the [[Kedung Ombo]] dam construction.

He always sympathised with the poor and oppressed, and was considered as a hero and advocate for opposition to the [[Soeharto]] regime.
