Asimov is widely considered a master of [[hard science fiction]] and, along with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Arthur C.

The ''Galactic Empire'' novels are explicitly set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the ''Foundation'' series.  Later, beginning with ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', he linked this distant future to the Robot and Spacer stories, creating a unified "[[future history]]" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by [[Cordwainer Smith]] and [[Poul Anderson]].<ref>{{cite book |title= I.

Asimov wrote the [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'' series]] of [[Young-adult fiction|juvenile]] science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1969) (in English) Opus 100 (Anthology) [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] "So [Walter Bradbury] said, 'Use a pseudonym.' And I did. I choose Paul French and..."</ref>

The prolific Asimov also wrote [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[fantasy]], as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain scientific concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationalities, birth dates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as [[etymology|etymologies]] and pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science|Guide to Science]]'', the three-volume set ''[[Understanding Physics]]'', and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery]]'', as well as works on [[astronomy]], [[mathematics]], the [[Bible]], [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] writing, and [[chemistry]].

Asimov was a long-time member and vice president of [[Mensa International]], albeit reluctantly; he described some members of that organization as "brain-proud and aggressive about their IQs".<ref>{{Cite journal

==Biography==
Asimov was born between October&nbsp;4, 1919 and January&nbsp;2, 1920<ref name="birthday"/> in [[Petrovichi]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (to the south-west from [[Smolensk]]) to Anna Rachel (Berman) Asimov and Judah Asimov, a family of [[Jew]]ish [[miller]]s. While his exact date of birth is uncertain, Asimov himself celebrated it on January 2.<ref name="birthday"/>

The family name derives from a word for [[winter cereals|winter crops]] in which his great-grandfather dealt. This word is spelled {{lang|ru|<U+043E><U+0437><U+0438><U+043C><U+044B><U+0435> (''ozimye'')}} in Russian, and {{lang|be|<U+0430><U+0437><U+0456><U+043C><U+044B><U+044F> (''azimiya'')}} in Belarusian.<ref name="winter_crops">[http://translate.google.com/#ru/be/%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%B5 Google Translate Russian <U+2192> Belarusian (<U+043E><U+0437><U+0438><U+043C><U+044B><U+0435> <U+2192> <U+0430><U+0437><U+0456><U+043C><U+044B><U+044F>)].

His family emigrated to the United States when he was three years old. Since his parents always spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and English with him, he never learned Russian.<ref>{{cite book |title= It's Been a Good Life|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|editor= Janet Asimov|year= 2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location= Amherst, New York|isbn= 1-57392-968-9|page= 12}}</ref> Growing up in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five<ref>{{cite book|title=I.

His parents owned a succession of [[candy store]]s, and everyone in the family was expected to work in them. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928 at the age of eight.

===Education and career===
Asimov began reading science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s at a young age.<ref>{{cite video

}}</ref> His father, as a matter of principle, forbade reading the pulps, as he considered them to be trash, but Asimov persuaded him that the science fiction magazines had "Science" in the title, so they were educational. Around the age of 11, he began to write his own stories, and by age 19, after he discovered [[science fiction fandom]], he was selling stories to the science fiction magazines. [[John W. Campbell]], then editor of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title= Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction|last= Gunn|first= James|authorlink= James Gunn (author)|year= 1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-503059-1|pages= 12<U+2013>13, 20}}</ref>

Asimov attended New York City public schools, including [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys High School]] in [[Brooklyn]].<ref name="Early Asimov">{{cite book|title=The Early Asimov Volume 1|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|page=10|publisher=[[Panther Books]]|location=[[St. Albans]], Hertfordshire, UK|year=1973|isbn=0-586-03806-X}}</ref> Graduating at 15, he went on to Seth Low Junior College, a branch of [[Columbia University]] in Brooklyn, designed to absorb some of the Jewish and Italian-American students who applied to Columbia College, then the institution's primary undergraduate school for men with quotas on the number of admissions from those ethnic groups. Originally a [[zoology]] major, Asimov changed his subject to [[chemistry]] after his first semester as he disapproved of "dissecting an alley cat". After Seth Low Junior College closed in 1938, Asimov finished his BS degree at University Extension (later the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]]) in 1939. When he failed to secure admission to medical school, he applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia; initially rejected and then only accepted on a probationary basis, Asimov completed his MA in chemistry in 1941 and earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1948. In between, he spent three years during [[World War II]] working as a civilian at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]'s Naval Air Experimental Station. After the war ended, he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], serving for almost nine months before receiving an honorable discharge. In the course of his brief military career, he rose to the rank of [[corporal]] on the basis of his typing skills, and narrowly avoided participating in the 1946 [[atomic bomb]] tests at [[Bikini Atoll]].

[[File:Heinlein-decamp-and-asimov.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo|[[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] with Asimov, [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|Philadelphia Navy Yard]], 1944]]
After completing his doctorate, Asimov joined the faculty of the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine, with which he remained associated thereafter.<ref name="wiredforbooks">[http://wiredforbooks.org/isaacasimov/ Isaac Asimov Interview with Don Swaim] (1987)</ref> From 1958, this was in a nonteaching capacity, as he turned to writing full-time (his writing income had already exceeded his academic salary). Being [[tenure]]d, he retained the title of [[associate professor]], and in 1979, the university honored his writing by promoting him to full professor of biochemistry. Asimov's personal papers from 1965 onward are archived at the university's [[Mugar Memorial Library]], to which he donated them at the request of [[curator]] Howard Gotlieb. The collection fills 464 boxes, or 71 m of shelf space.

===Personal life===
Asimov married Gertrude Blugerman (1917, Canada<U+2013>1990, Boston) on July 26, 1942. They had two children, David (born 1951) and Robyn Joan (born 1955). In 1970, they separated and Asimov moved back to New York, this time to [[Manhattan]], where he lived for the rest of his life. He immediately began seeing [[Janet Asimov|Janet O. Jeppson]], and married her two weeks after his divorce from Gertrude in 1973.<ref>{{cite book |title= In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954<U+2013>1978|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1980|publisher=Doubleday|location= Garden City, New York|isbn= 0-385-15544-1}}</ref>

Asimov was a claustrophile: he enjoyed small, enclosed spaces.<ref>{{cite book |title= I. Asimov: A Memoir|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1994|publisher=Doubleday|location= New York|isbn= 0-385-41701-2|pages= 129<U+2013>131}}</ref> In the third volume of his autobiography, he recalls a childhood desire to own a magazine stand in a [[New York City Subway]] station, within which he could enclose himself and listen to the rumble of passing trains while reading.<ref>{{cite book |title= In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920<U+2013>1954|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1979|publisher=Doubleday|location= Garden City, New York|isbn= 0-385-13679-X}}</ref>

Asimov was [[fear of flying|afraid of flying]],<ref name="Acrophobia">{{cite book |title= I. Asimov: A Memoir|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1994|publisher=Doubleday|location= New York|isbn= 0-385-41701-2|pages= 125<U+2013>129}}</ref> only doing so twice in his entire life (once in the course of his work at the Naval Air Experimental Station, and once returning home from the army base in [[Oahu]] in 1946)<ref name="Acrophobia" />
Consequently, he seldom traveled great distances. This phobia influenced several of his fiction works, such as the [[Wendell Urth]] mystery stories and the ''Robot'' novels featuring [[Elijah Baley]]. In his later years, Asimov found enjoyment traveling on [[cruise ship]]s; on several cruises he was part of the entertainment program, giving science-themed talks aboard ships such as the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].<ref name="Acrophobia" />

Asimov was an able public speaker and was a frequent fixture at [[science fiction convention]]s, where he was friendly and approachable.<ref name="Acrophobia" /> He patiently answered tens of thousands of questions and other mail with postcards, and was pleased to give autographs. He was of medium height, stocky, with [[mutton chop]] whiskers, and a distinct [[New York accent]]. His physical dexterity was very poor. He never learned to swim or ride a bicycle; however, he did learn to drive a car after he moved to Boston. In his humor book ''Asimov Laughs Again'', he describes Boston driving as "anarchy on wheels".<ref>{{cite book |title= Asimov Laughs Again|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1992|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|location= New York|isbn= 0-06-016826-9}}</ref>

Asimov's wide interests included his participation in his later years in organizations devoted to the [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]<ref name="Acrophobia"/> and in The Wolfe Pack,<ref>See [http://www.nerowolfe.org/ NeroWolfe.org]</ref> a group of devotees of the [[Nero Wolfe]] mysteries written by [[Rex Stout]]. Many of his short stories mention or quote Gilbert and Sullivan.<ref>White (2005), pp. 83 and 219<U+2013>20</ref> He was a prominent member of the [[Baker Street Irregulars]], the leading [[Sherlock Holmes]] society <ref name="Acrophobia" /> having been admitted after writing an essay arguing that Professor Moriarty's work "The Dynamics of An Asteroid" involved the willful destruction of an ancient civilized planet. (This was alluded to in the 2011 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'' when Holmes ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) asks Moriarty ([[Jared Harris]]) to autograph this work, after which Moriarty asks after the health of "the Good Doctor"; a double-entendre meaning both Dr. Watson and Isaac Asimov, whose nickname it was.) He was also a member of the all-male literary banqueting club, the [[Trap Door Spiders]], which served as the basis of his fictional group of mystery solvers the [[Black Widowers]].<ref name="Asimov_p376-377">Asimov, Isaac. ''I. Asimov, a Memoir'', New York, Doubleday, 1994, pages 376<U+2013>377.</ref>

In 1984, the [[American Humanist Association]] (AHA) named him the Humanist of the Year. He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref> From 1985 until his death in 1992, he served as president of the AHA, an honorary appointment. His successor was his friend and fellow writer [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] He was also a close friend of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], and earned a screen credit on ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' for advice he gave during production (generally, confirming to [[Paramount Pictures]] that Roddenberry's ideas were legitimate science-fictional extrapolation).

Asimov was a founding member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, now known as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sixteen Notable Figures in Science and Skepticism Elected CSI Fellows|url=http://www.csicop.org/news/press_releases/show/sixteen_notable_figures_in_science_and_skepticism_elected_csi_fellows|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=11 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Playing with fire / Firewalking with the Wessex Skeptics|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717254.900--forum-playing-with-fire--firewalking-with-the-wessex-skeptics--.html|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=11 October 2012}}</ref> The organization lists him as a fellow.<ref>{{cite web|title=CSI Fellows and Staff|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csi_fellows_and_staff|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=11 October 2012}}</ref>

===Illness and death===
Asimov suffered a heart attack in 1977, and had [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple bypass surgery]] in December 1983. When he died in New York City on April 6, 1992, his brother Stanley reported heart and [[Renal failure|kidney failure]] as the cause of death.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=Isaac Asimov, Whose Thoughts and Books Traveled the Universe, Is Dead at 72|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/07/books/isaac-asimov-whose-thoughts-and-books-traveled-the-universe-is-dead-at-72.html?scp=7&sq=Asimov+Isaac&st=cse|accessdate=September 4, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 7, 1992|page=B7}}</ref> He was survived by his second wife, Janet, and his children from his first marriage. Ten years after his death, Janet Asimov's edition of Asimov's autobiography, ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]'', revealed that the myocardial and renal complications were the result of an infection by [[HIV]], which he had contracted from a blood transfusion received during his bypass operation.<ref>{{cite web

Asimov's family considered disclosing his condition just after his death, but the controversy that erupted the same year when [[Arthur Ashe]] announced his own HIV infection (also contracted from a blood transfusion during heart surgery) convinced them otherwise. Ten years later, after most of Asimov's doctors had died, Janet and Robyn Asimov agreed that the HIV story should be made public.<ref>{{cite web

===Overview===
[[File:Isaac Asimov on Throne.png|thumb|left|[[Rowena Morrill]]'s portrait of Asimov enthroned with symbols of his life's work]]{{Robotic laws}}
Asimov's career can be divided into several periods. His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]''. He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{Cite journal

Asimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]] (see ''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329). Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing the words '[[positronic brain|positronic]]' (an entirely fictional technology), '[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]' (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations) and '[[robotics]]' into the English language. Asimov coined the term 'robotics' without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word 'psychohistory', the word 'robotics' continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with "[[positronic brain]]s", giving Asimov credit for conceiving this fictional technology.<!-- Not "inventing".  The positronic brain is described as Asimov's "dream" (in the episode "Datalore").-->

===Science fiction===
Asimov first began reading the science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s sold in his family's confectionery store in 1929. In the mid-1930s he came into contact with [[science fiction fandom]], particularly the circle that became the [[Futurians]]. He began writing his first science fiction story, "Cosmic Corkscrew", in 1937; finished it on June 19, 1938, inspired by a visit to the offices of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''; and  personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell rejected "Cosmic Corkscrew", but encouraged Asimov to keep trying, and Asimov did. In October, he sold the third story he finished,<!--source does not cover that part--> "[[Marooned Off Vesta]]", to ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', then a monthly edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]], and it appeared in the March 1939 issue.<ref name=isfdb/> Two more of his stories appeared that year, "The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use" in the May ''Amazing'' and "Trends" in the July ''Astounding''.<ref name=isfdb/> For 1940, [[ISFDB]] catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines, including one in ''Astounding''.<ref name=isfdb/>

In September 1941, ''Astounding'' published the 32nd story Asimov wrote, "[[Nightfall (Asimov short story)|Nightfall]]", which has been described as one of "the most famous science-fiction stories of all time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue8/asimov.html|title=Isaac Asimov: The Good Doctor |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |last=Spud |first=The Invincible |work=Bewildering Stories article}}</ref> In 1968 the Science Fiction Writers of America voted "Nightfall" the best science fiction short story ever written.<ref name=obit/> In his short story collection ''[[Nightfall and Other Stories]]'', he wrote, "The writing of 'Nightfall' was a watershed in my professional career&nbsp;... I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a 'classic'."

"Nightfall" is an archetypal example of [[social science fiction]], a term coined by Asimov to describe a new trend in the 1940s, led by authors including Asimov and [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]], away from [[gadget]]s and [[space opera]] and toward speculation about the [[human condition]].

By 1941, Asimov had begun selling regularly to ''Astounding'', which was then the field's leading magazine.<!-- two appeared in Astounding that year per ISFDB --> From 1943 to 1949, all of his published science fiction appeared in ''Astounding''.

In 1942, he published the first of his ''Foundation'' stories<U+2014>later collected in the [[Foundation Trilogy|''Foundation'' trilogy]]: ''[[Foundation (novel)|Foundation]]'' (1951), ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'' (1952), and ''[[Second Foundation]]'' (1953)<U+2014>which recount the collapse and rebirth of a vast [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|interstellar empire]] in a universe of the future. Taken together, they are his most famous work of science fiction, along with the [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|''Robot ''series]]. Many years later, due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another,<ref name="wiredforbooks" /> he continued the series with ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982) and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1992). The series features his fictional science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted.

His [[positronic robot]] stories<U+2014>many of which were collected in ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950)<U+2014>were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of [[ethics]] for robots (see [[Three Laws of Robotics]]) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in one of his biographical pieces that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a Frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators.

The robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977 [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to "the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.  The 2004 movie ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', starring [[Will Smith]], was based on an unrelated script by [[Jeff Vintar]] titled ''Hardwired'', with Asimov's ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov's title were acquired.<ref>{{cite web

Also, one of Asimov's robot short stories, "[[The Bicentennial Man]]", was expanded into a novel ''[[The Positronic Man]]'' by Asimov and [[Robert Silverberg]], and this was adapted into the 1999 movie ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]].

Besides movies, his [[The Foundation Series|''Foundation'']] and [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|''Robot'']] stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as [[Roger MacBride Allen]], [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], and [[David Brin]]. These appear to have been done with the blessing, and often at the request of, Asimov's widow, [[Janet Asimov]].

In 1948, he also wrote a [[False document|spoof chemistry article]], "[[Thiotimoline|The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline]]". At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral [[dissertation]], and for the oral examination to follow that. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at [[Columbia University]], Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. During his oral examination shortly thereafter, Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he received. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, "What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline". The hysterically laughing Asimov was led out of the room then. After a five-minute or so wait, he was summoned back into the Examination Room and congratulated as "Dr. Asimov".<ref>Asimov, I. (1974) ''The Early Asimov, Volume 3.'' St Albans: Granada Publishing Ltd, p. 119. ISBN 0-586-03937-6</ref>

In 1949, the book publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]'s science fiction editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted Asimov's unpublished [[Novella|novelette]] "Grow Old Along With Me" (40,000 words) for publication, but requested that it be extended to a full novel of 70,000 words. The book appeared under the Doubleday imprint in January 1950 with the title of ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''. The Doubleday company went on to publish five more original science fiction novels by Asimov in the 1950s, along with the six juvenile [[Lucky Starr series|Lucky Starr novels]], the latter under the pseudonym of "Paul French". Doubleday also published collections of Asimov's short stories, beginning with ''[[The Martian Way and Other Stories]]'' in 1955. The early 1950s also saw the [[Gnome Press]] company publishing one collection of Asimov's positronic robot stories as ''[[I, Robot]]'' and his ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' stories and novelettes as the three books of the ''Foundation trilogy''. More positronic robot stories were republished in book form as ''[[The Rest of the Robots]]''.

When new science fiction magazines, notably ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' magazine and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', appeared in the 1950s, Asimov began publishing short stories in them as well. He would later refer to the 1950s as his "golden decade". A number of these stories are included in his ''[[The Best of Isaac Asimov|Best of]]'' anthology, including "[[The Last Question]]" (1956), on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of [[entropy]]. It was his personal favorite and considered by many to be equal to "[[Nightfall (Asimov short story)|Nightfall]]". Asimov wrote of it in 1973:

{{quote|Why is it my favorite? For one thing I got the idea all at once and didn't have to fiddle with it; and I wrote it in white-heat and scarcely had to change a word. This sort of thing endears any story to any writer.

Then, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers. Frequently someone writes to ask me if I can give them the name of a story, which they 'think' I may have written, and tell them where to find it. They don't remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably "The Last Question". This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, 'Dr. Asimov, there's a story I think you wrote, whose title I can't remember<U+2014>' at which point I interrupted to tell him it was "The Last Question" and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles.}}

In December 1974, former [[Beatle]] [[Paul McCartney]] approached Asimov and asked him if he could write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical. McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials. The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a "treatment" or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story. The treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives.

Beginning in 1977, Asimov lent his name to ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' (now ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'') and penned an editorial for each issue. There was also a short-lived ''Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine'' and a companion ''Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology'' reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as the stablemates ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine|Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine's]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine|Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine's]]'' "anthologies").

===Popular science===
During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov shifted gears somewhat, and substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' and 1982's ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', two of which were mysteries). At the same time, he greatly increased his nonfiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 engendered public concern over a "science gap", which Asimov's publishers were eager to fill with as much material as he could write.

Meanwhile, the monthly ''[[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' invited him to continue his regular nonfiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine]]'', ostensibly dedicated to [[popular science]], but with Asimov having complete editorial freedom. The first of the ''F&SF'' columns appeared in November 1958, and they followed uninterrupted thereafter, with 399 entries, until Asimov's terminal illness. These columns, periodically collected into books by his principal publisher, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], helped make Asimov's reputation as a "Great Explainer" of science, and were referred to by him as his only pop-science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects at hand on the part of his readers. The popularity of his first wide-ranging reference work, ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science]]'', also allowed him to give up most of his academic responsibilities and become essentially a full-time [[freelance writer]].

Asimov wrote several essays on the social contentions of his time, including "Thinking About Thinking" and "Science: Knock Plastic" (1967).

The great variety of information covered in Asimov's writings once prompted [[Kurt Vonnegut]] to ask, "How does it feel to know everything?" Asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the 'reputation' of omniscience<U+2014>"Uneasy".<ref>Asimov, I. ''[[In Joy Still Felt]]'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 30.</ref> In the introduction to his story collection ''[[Slow Learner]],'' [[Thomas Pynchon]] admitted that he relied upon Asimov's science popularizations (and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') to provide his knowledge of [[entropy]].

Asimov also contributed science article entries to several encyclopaedias, including Groliers, The Encyclopaedia Americana, The Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, and the World Book Encyclopaedia Yearbook.

The feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called "Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]", put together as they shared a cab ride in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself).<ref>{{cite web

====Coined terms====
Asimov coined the term "[[robotics]]" in his 1941 story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]",<ref>According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' the term "robotics" was first used in the short story "Liar!" published in the May, 1941 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.</ref> though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word, as he stated in ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' ("The Robot Chronicles"), though while acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story  "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" .<ref>{{cite book

Asimov also coined the term "[[spome]]" in a paper entitled, "There's No Place Like Spome" in ''Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/yr2000/s3.htm |title=Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments |publisher=Locusmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> originally presented as a paper to the American Chemical Society on September 13, 1965. It refers to any system closed with respect to matter and open with respect to energy capable of sustaining human life indefinitely.

Asimov coined the term "[[psychohistory (fictional)]]" in reference to a science in [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] universe which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. It was first introduced in the five short stories  (1942<U+2013>1944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel ''[[Foundation (novel)|Foundation]]''. Somewhat later, the term "[[psychohistory]]" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.

===Other writings===
In addition to his interest in science, Asimov was also greatly interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, most notably ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965), ''The Roman Republic'' (1966), ''The Roman Empire'' (1967), ''The Egyptians'' (1967) and ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968).

He published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes<U+2014>covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969<U+2014> and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970), ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).

Asimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing "pure" mysteries. He only published two full-length mystery novels, but  wrote a fair number of stories about the Black Widowers, a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, whom he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{Cite journal

Toward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks (and embarrassed one fan by autographing her copy with an impromptu limerick that rhymed "Nancy" with "romancy"). Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of "George" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.

Particularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by "J") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by "M"), Asimov published ''The Sensuous Dirty Old Man'' under the byline "Dr. 'A{{'"}} (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972).

Asimov published two volumes of autobiography: ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' (1979) and ''[[In Joy Still Felt]]'' (1980). A third autobiography, ''I. Asimov: A Memoir'', was published in April 1994. The epilogue was written by his widow [[Janet Asimov]] a decade after his death. ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]'' (2002), edited by Janet, is a condensed version of his three autobiographies. He also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing, ''[[Opus 100]]'' (1969), ''Opus 200'' (1979), and ''Opus 300'' (1984).

In 1987, the Asimovs co-wrote ''How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort''. In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.

Asimov and ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] developed a unique relationship during ''Star Trek's'' initial launch in the late 1960s. Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek's'' scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming despite its inaccuracies, that ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.

In 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A<U+2013>D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., "D-73" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=[[The Tragedy of the Moon]] |pages=48<U+2013>58 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |year=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3 }}</ref>

==Writing style==

{{quote|Except for two stories<U+2014>"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]" and "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]"<U+2014>they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent&nbsp;... The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction<U+2014>play themselves on a relatively bare stage.}}

Gunn observes places where Asimov's style rises to the demands of the situation; he cites the climax of "Liar!" as an example. Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in "Liar!" and "Evidence", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels. Asimov addresses this criticism at the beginning of his book ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':<ref name="Nemesis-Authour's note">{{Cite journal | last = Asimov | first = Isaac | title = Nemesis | date = October 1989 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>
{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing<U+2014>to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics<U+2014>Well, they can do whatever they wish.}}

Other than books by Gunn and Patrouch,  a relative dearth of "literary" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:

{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.}}

In fairness, Gunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both take the stand that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book goes into considerable depth commenting upon each of Asimov's novels published to that date. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but he does call some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' "reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose "need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society".

Although he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence), Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html|title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012|last=Jenkins |first= John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create "[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]", one of the early ''Robot'' stories. See ''In Memory Yet Green'' for details of that time period.) Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a "dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of "kyrt"</ref> Asimov fan" could enjoy it. Asimov's tendency to contort his timelines is perhaps most apparent in his later novel ''Nemesis'', in which one group of characters lives in the "present" and another group starts in the "past", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.

===Limitations===
Asimov was also criticized for the general absence of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and of [[extraterrestrial life]] in his science fiction.

;Alien life'''
Asimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name="Early Asimov" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name="WWE-1972">{{cite web

In the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novella "[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]", Asimov describes an author clearly based on himself who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a "compu-drama", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov ("Gregory Laborian") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.

;Gender and social issues
Others have criticized him for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' ("Women and Science Fiction"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early SF stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Book World" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}

''The Naked Sun'' (1957) deals with [[social issue]]s as a core part of its central setting and motivation, depicts genetic engineering in the guise of [[eugenics]] as a fundamental part of that society, and presents the reader with inverted arcologies where a single person is the focal point of the artificial environment, as well as a hero who hails from a "normal" [[arcology]] on Earth. Meanwhile, totally artificial birth, although not specifically cloning, is the aim of the leaders of the society, sexual want is the major driving force of the main female character (albeit veiled in 1950s sensibilities), and the entire story is used to make the point that too much order is ultimately a stagnant dead end to be avoided.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Views==

===Religion===
Isaac Asimov was an [[Atheism|atheist]], a [[Humanism|humanist]], and a [[Rationalism|rationalist]].<ref name="Popper">Isaac Asimov, "The Way of Reason", in ''In Pursuit of Truth: Essays on the Philosophy of Karl Popper on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday,,'' ed. [[Paul Levinson]], Humanities Press, 1982, pp. ix<U+2013>x.</ref> He did not oppose religious conviction in others, but he frequently railed against [[superstition|superstitious]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] beliefs that tried to pass themselves off as genuine science. During his childhood, his father and mother observed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] traditions, though not as stringently as they had in [[Petrovichi]]; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]]. As his books ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' and ''Asimov Laughs Again'' record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, [[Satan]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Jerusalem]], and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.

For a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, "shine as a learned scholar"<ref>Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920<U+2013>1954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a "[[Humanism|humanist]]" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew<ref>"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10<U+2013>13. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref> as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': "I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish."

When asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied, "I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time."<ref>Isaac Asimov on Science and the Bible (Free Inquiry -- Spring 1982)</ref>

In his last volume of autobiography, Asimov wrote, "If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul."<ref>{{cite book |title= I. Asimov: A Memoir|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1995|publisher=Bantam|location= New York|isbn= 0-553-56997-X|page= 338}}</ref> The same memoir states his belief that [[Hell]] is "the drooling dream of a [[Sadism and masochism (as medical terms)|sadist]]" crudely affixed to an all-merciful God; if even human governments were willing to curtail cruel and unusual punishments, wondered Asimov, why would punishment in the afterlife not be restricted to a limited term? Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife  existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who "slandered God by inventing Hell".<ref>{{cite book |title= I. Asimov: A Memoir|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1995|publisher=Bantam|location= New York|isbn= 0-553-56997-X|pages= 336<U+2013>338}}</ref>

===Politics===
Asimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]]. He was unhappy about what he considered an "irrationalist" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]; Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a "no-man's land of the spirit" from which he wondered if they would ever return.

He vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him "a crook and a liar".  He followed the unfolding events of Watergate day-to-day, and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. He was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: "I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal. To my way of thinking, the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again."<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 39</ref>

Though Jewish by birth, Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards [[Israel]]. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though remaining careful to insist he is by no means a [[Zionist]]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=In Memory Yet Green|quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> However, in his third autobiography, he clarifies his position by stating his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he is opposed to the concept of nation states in general, and supports the notion of a single humanity. He especially worries about the safety of Israel given that it has been created among hostile neighbours, and that Jews have merely created for themselves another "Jewish ghetto".<ref>{{Cite journal

Actually, I feel that no human group deserves a "homeland" in the usual sense of the word.... I am not a Zionist, then, because I don't believe in nations, and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world.}}</ref>

===Social issues===
Asimov considered himself a feminist even before [[Women's Liberation]] became a widespread movement; he joked that he wished women to be free "because I hate it when they charge".<ref>{{cite book |title= Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|year= 1991|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn= 0-395-57226-6|pages= 346<U+2013>347}}</ref> More seriously, he argued that the issue of women's rights was closely connected to that of population control. Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a "moral right" on population grounds, as must all [[consent]]ing adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction.<ref name="YIA" /> He issued many appeals for [[population control]], reflecting a perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part I|url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf|work=transcript page 6, 10/17/1988 show|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref>

In a 1988 interview by [[Bill Moyers]], Asimov proposed [[computer-aided learning]], where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part II|url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov2.pdf|work=transcript page 3, 10/17/1988 show|accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world. Also, the [[One to one computing|one-to-one]] model would let students learn at their own pace.

===Environmental issues===
Asimov's defense of civil applications of [[nuclear power]] even after the [[Three Mile Island]] nuclear power plant incident damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals. In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'',<ref name="YIA">Asimov, Isaac (1996). ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. ISBN 0-385-47624-8.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in "no danger whatsoever" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near "a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]" (referring to the [[Bhopal disaster]]).

In the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] crisis such as [[global warming]] and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].

===Other authors===
Asimov stated, both in his autobiography and in several essays, that he enjoyed the writings of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. He paid tribute to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in a "Black Widowers" story. (In his letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, who had previously interviewed him for ''Daily Telegraph Magazine'', Tolkien said that he enjoyed the science fiction of Isaac Asimov.)

He admired a number of his contemporaries, in particular fellow science-fiction author and science writer Arthur C. Clarke, with whom he entered into the lighthearted "Treaty of Park Avenue," which stipulated that Clarke was free to refer to himself as the best science fiction writer in the world (Asimov being second-best), provided he admitted that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (Clarke being second-best). He freely acknowledged a number of his fellow writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of [[Harlan Ellison]], "He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am."

==Influence==
[[Paul Krugman]], a Nobel laureate in economics, has stated Asimov's concept of psychohistory inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/|title=The Conscience of a Liberal, ''Who Are You Calling Dense?''|accessdate=November 18, 2010|last=Krugman |first= Paul|work=The New York Times|date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

John Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed:
{{quote|It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, ''The Unauthorized Life'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012|last=Jenkins |first= John}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}}}}

The ''Robot'' series was originally separate from the ''Foundation'' series. The Galactic Empire novels were published as independent stories, set earlier in the same future as ''Foundation''. Later in life, Asimov synthesized the ''Robot'' series into a single coherent "history" that appeared in the extension of the ''Foundation'' series.
