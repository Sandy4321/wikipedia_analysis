==Career==
===Early career===
Azaria has described his career as being very gradual, in that he has not skipped any of the usual "career steps".<ref name=freshair/> After moving to Los Angeles, where he was trained by acting teacher [[Roy London]],<ref name=awards/> he began working as a stand-up comedian,<ref name=msn/> becoming popular at local comedy clubs.<ref name=awards/> He made his first television appearance with a two-line role in an episode of the 1986 [[Peter Boyle]] series ''[[Joe Bash]]'',<ref name=msn/> though his part was edited out before the show's broadcast. Still, the role won him admission to the [[Screen Actors Guild]],<ref name=yahoo>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019189/bio|title=Hank Azaria|accessdate=2007-08-14|work=[[Yahoo!]]}}</ref> and enabled him to appear in an episode of ''[[Family Ties]]''.<ref name=msn/>

===''The Simpsons''===
[[File:The Simpsons 5F12.png|alt=Two cartoon characters aboard a ship at night, standing at the railing; a male dressed as a captain and a female dressed in a sleeveless gown appear to be chatting.|right|250px|thumb|Azaria's first role on ''The Simpsons'' was [[Moe Szyslak]], shown with Moe's one-time girlfriend Ren<U+00E9>e (voiced by [[Helen Hunt]], to whom Azaria was married for a time).]]

He became most famous for his [[Voice acting|voice]] work on the animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]'', a show that continues to the present. He joined the show at age 25, having previously performed only one voice over, as an animated dog in the Fox pilot ''Hollywood Dog''.<ref name=msn/> The first voice he performed was that of town bartender [[Moe Szyslak]], replacing [[Christopher Collins]] who had initially voiced the character. Having known him from the failed pilot, casting director [[Bonita Pietila]] called Azaria and asked him to audition for the voice of Moe.<ref name=msn/> At the time he was doing a play, in which he performed the role of a drug dealer, basing his voice on [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]''. He used that voice in the audition, and was told by [[Matt Groening]] and [[Sam Simon]] to make it more gravelly, ultimately becoming the voice of Moe. Groening and Simon thought it was perfect and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] Collins' voice.<ref name=freshair>{{cite interview|last=Azaria|first=Hank| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679119| city = Philadelphia| date = 2004-12-06| accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref><ref name=barber/><ref>{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|date=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Azaria did not expect to hear from the show again but they continued to call him back, first to perform the voice of [[Clancy Wiggum|Chief Wiggum]], and then [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], until eventually during the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] he was doing numerous voices. At that point he was given a contract and made a permanent member of the cast.<ref name=freshair/> As well as Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of the [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Carl Carlson]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], Dr. [[Nick Riviera]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Eddie and Lou|Lou]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Snake Jailbird|Snake]], [[Van Houten family#Kirk|Kirk Van Houten]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Sea Captain|the Sea Captain]], [[Springfield Elementary School#Superintendent Chalmers|Superintendent Chalmers]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Disco Stu|Disco Stu]], [[List of media personalities in The Simpsons#Duffman|Duffman]], the "Wise Guy" and numerous other one-time characters.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCann |first=Jesse L.|coauthors=Matt Groening|title=[[The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued]]|year=2002 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers |isbn=0-06-050592-3 |pages=116 }}</ref>

In addition to Moe's voice being based on Al Pacino, many of Azaria's other recurring characters are based on something else. He took Apu's voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on [[Peter Sellers]]' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film ''[[The Party (film)|The Party]]''.<ref name=freshair/> Originally, it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotypical, but due to Azaria's reading of the line "Hello, Mr. Homer" his character stayed.<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |accessdate=2007-08-15 |date=2000-10-21|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=Joe Rhodes}}</ref> Azaria, however, disputed this on ''LateNet with Ray Ellin'', claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical.<ref name=ellin>{{cite interview |subject=Hank Azaria |interviewer=[[Ray Ellin]] |title=Hank Azaria on LateNet with Ray Ellin |url=http://www.dailycomedy.com/joke/10559|program=LateNet with Ray Ellin|callsign=Daily Comedy|date=2007-12-05|accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> Chief Wiggum's voice was originally a parody of [[David Brinkley]] but when Azaria was told it was too slow he switched it to that of [[Edward G.

Macy]]. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=enemy>{{cite video|people=Azaria, Hank|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer's Enemy]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

His friends refer to him as "the freakish mimic" due to his ability to copy almost anybody's voice instantly after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do such a thing, until he realized that it was a rare talent. Azaria was glad to have found the "ultimate outlet" for his skill, in ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=freshair/> Matt Groening has stated that Azaria possesses the ability to turn unfunny lines into some of the best in an episode,<ref name=barber/> while former writer [[Jay Kogen]] stated: "Just when I think I know [Azaria's] bag of tricks, he's always got a new thing he does to surprise me."<ref name=msn/> Throughout the run of ''The Simpsons'', Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally.<ref name=freshair/> Azaria's work on the show has won him several awards, including three Emmys for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]]".<ref name=awards/> He was also nominated for the award in 2009, but lost to co-star Dan Castellaneta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2009ptemmys/61stemmys_nomswin_crtv.php?action=search_db#1|title=61st Primetime Emmy Awards Quick Search |accessdate=2009-09-12|date=2009-09-12 |publisher=''[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]''}}</ref> Azaria, with the rest of the principal cast, reprised all of his voice roles from ''The Simpsons'', for the 2007 film ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Homer going to bat in '07|accessdate=2007-08-16|date=2006-04-02|author=Michael Fleming|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>

Up until 1998, Azaria was paid [[United States dollar|$]]30,000 per episode. Azaria and the five other main ''The Simpsons'' voice actors were then involved in a pay dispute in which Fox threatened to replace them with new actors and went as far as preparing for casting of new voices. However, the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004, they received $125,000 per episode. In 2004, the voice actors intentionally skipped several table reads, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html |title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share|accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2004-04-03|author=Dan Glaister |work=[[The Age]]}}</ref> The strike was resolved a month later,<ref>{{cite news |title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2004-05-01|work=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> with Azaria's pay increasing to something between $250,000<ref>{{cite news|title=Meet the Simpsons |date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Express]]|author=Peter Sheridan}}</ref> and $360,000 per episode.<ref name=2008actors>{{cite news | author = Michael Schneider | title = Still no deal for 'Simpsons' cast | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2008-05-19 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986121.html?categoryId=14&cs=1 | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In 2008, production for the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twentieth season]] was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a "healthy bump" in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode.<ref name=2008actors/> The dispute was later resolved and Azaria and the rest of the cast received their requested pay raise.<ref>{{cite news |author=WENN |title='The Simpsons' Cast Settles Pay Dispute |work=Hollywood.com |date=2008-05-20 |url= http://www.hollywood.com/news/The_Simpsons_Cast_Settles_Pay_Dispute/5239887 | accessdate=2008-05-31}}</ref>

Once ''The Simpsons'' was "going steadily" and Azaria had enough money to live on, he stopped working on commercials as he found them "so demoralizing" and he always sounded sarcastic whenever he read for them. When recording the part of "Jell-O Man" for a [[Jell-O]] commercial, he was told to make the voice he offered "more likeable and friendly so that children like him." After pointing out that "Jell-O Man" was a fictional character, he left and never recorded for an advertisement again.<ref name=freshair/>

===Further career===
With the continuing success of ''The Simpsons'', Azaria began taking on roles, such as an appearance in the 1990 film ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' playing a police detective investigating the murder of a prostitute.<ref name=awards/> From then he became a regular on the show ''[[Herman's Head]]'' playing Jay Nichols, alongside ''The Simpsons'' co-star [[Yeardley Smith]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Herman's Head |author=Mark Lewisohn |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040212000254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/h/hermanshead_1299001449.shtml |accessdate=2007-08-16 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> He regularly recorded for ''The Simpsons'' and filmed ''Herman's Head'' during the same day.<ref name=Worcester/> He won praise as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 [[Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Quiz Show (1994 film)|Quiz Show]]'',<ref name="parents"/> and in the same year, he made his first appearance on ''[[Friends]]'', playing the recurring character David, one of [[Phoebe Buffay]]'s boyfriends. His first appearance was in the show's tenth episode, before the character left for [[Minsk]]. He came back in the show's seventh season, before making several appearances in the ninth, which culminated in him proposing to Phoebe. She rejected him, and David left for good.<ref name=awards/> From 1996, he had a recurring role in ''[[Mad About You]]'' as Nat, the dog walker.<ref name="parents"/> Azaria earned an Emmy nomination for both roles.<ref name=awards/> He continued his voice-over work as [[Eddie Brock|Venom/Eddie Brock]] in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' for four years,<ref>{{cite web |title=Venom |url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/bios/villains/venom/|accessdate=2007-08-16|work=Marvel Animation Age}}</ref> and in the animated feature ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'', as Bartok the bat, reprising the role in the direct-to-video sequel ''Bartok the Magnificent''.<ref name=awards/>

In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film ''[[The Birdcage]]''. He was nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]],<ref name=awards/> and critically branded "the most hilarious performance in the film."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3a138262|title=The Birdcage |accessdate=2007-12-31|author=Alison Macor|date=1996-03-08|work=The Austin Chronicle}}</ref> For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance.<ref name=freshair/> Azaria appeared in several films, often as minor characters.

Azaria starred as [[psychiatrist]] Craig "Huff" Huffstodt in the television series ''[[Huff (TV series)|Huff]]'', for which he also served as an executive producer.
