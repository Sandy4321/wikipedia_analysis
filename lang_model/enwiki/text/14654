This is the '''[[order of battle]] for Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]]''' during major periods of hostility in the [[Korean War]]. After [[People's Republic of China]] officially entered the Korean War in October 1950 by designating [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) North East Frontier Force as the People's Volunteer Army (PVA),<ref name=chen186>{{harvnb|Chen|1996|p=186}}.</ref> the PVA had spent two years and nine months in combat operations and five years and three months in garrison duties, with its last element left Korea in 1958.<ref name=zhang247>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=247}}.</ref> During this period, China had paid a huge price for its involvement in the Korean War.<ref name=zhang247/>  According to Chinese archives, about 73 percent of Chinese infantry forces, 67 percent of Chinese artillery forces, 100 percent of Chinese armor forces, 52 percent of Chinese air forces were deployed in Korea at one point or another, along side with 600,000 civilian laborers<U+2014>in total more than three million civilian and military personnel.<ref name=zhang247/><ref name=Li111>{{harvnb|Li|2007|p=111}}.</ref> Out of those forces, around 152,000 were killed, 383,500 were wounded, 450,000 were hospitalized, 21,000 were captured and 4,000 were missing.<ref name=Li111/> China had also consumed 5.6 million tons of war materials, 399 aircraft and 12,916 vehicles for its war efforts.<ref name=zhang247/> About a third of Chinese government's annual budget were spent on the military between 1950<U+2013>53, totaling 10 billion [[RMB]] by the war's end.<ref name=Li112>{{harvnb|Li|2007|p=112}}.</ref><ref group=nb>Equivalent to 3.3 billion [[USD]]. See {{harvnb|Li|2007|p=112}}.</ref> All in all, the Korean War was the largest foreign war in Chinese military history, despite the fact that no declaration of war had ever existed between China and [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]]' members.<ref name=Li111/>

It is normally difficult for historians to provide an accurate order of battle for Chinese troops in Korea, due to the fact that most of the information could only be obtained from prisoner interrogations or captured documents.<ref name=rottman181>{{harvnb|Rottman|2001|p=181}}.</ref> The constant Chinese troop movements and the reattachment of units between different commands further added to the confusion.<ref name=rottman181/> By the 1980s, however, a large number of [[Primary source|primary documentations]], memoirs and scholarly works on Chinese involvements in the Korean War began to appear in China, and it enabled historians to make a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of Chinese military operations during the Korean War.<ref name=zhang9>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=9}}.</ref>

Although the Chinese leadership did not make the decision to enter the [[Korean War]] until [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]] (UN) forces crossed the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] in October 1950,<ref name=chen186/><ref name=zhang78>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=78}}.</ref> it had been preparing for the possibility ever since United States intervened in Korea in June 1950.<ref name=zhang56>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=56}}.</ref><ref name=chen126_128>{{harvnb|Chen|1996|pp=126<U+2013>128}}.</ref> On July 13, 1950 and soon after UN forces entered the Korean War, China's Chairman, [[Mao Zedong]], ordered the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) 13th Army<U+2014>China's strategic reserve stationed in southern China<U+2014>to form the PLA North East Frontier Force (NEFF) in [[Manchuria]].<ref name=zhang58_59>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=58<U+2013>59}}.</ref><ref group group="nb" name=nomenclature>In Chinese military nomenclature, the term "Army" (<U+519B>) means [[Corps]], while the term "Army Group" (<U+96C6><U+56E2><U+519B>) means [[Field Army|Army]].</ref> Aside from the 38th, 39th and 40th Infantry Corps originally belonged to the 13th Army, the NEFF also included the 42nd Infantry Corps, three artillery divisions, one anti-aircraft regiments and three transport regiments<U+2014>in total more than 250,000 men.<ref name=zhang59>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=59}}.</ref> On October 19, 1950 and under strict secrecy, the NEFF officially crossed the [[Yalu River]] under the name Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA),<ref name=chen186/><ref name=zhang93_94>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=93<U+2013>94}}.</ref> although advance scouting parties had been spotted by UN forces as early as October 13.<ref name=roe148>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=148}}.</ref> On October 23, the PLA 50th and 66th Corps were attached to the PVA 13th Army in order to reinforce the defenses at [[Sinuiju]] and [[Chongju, North Korea|Chongju]] area.<ref name=zhang100_101>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=100<U+2013>101}}.</ref> At the same time, the 13th Army Headquarters was disbanded to increase coordination between PVA Headquarters and its field units.<ref name=roe153>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=153}}.</ref>

On August 26, 1950, the Chinese [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] concluded that PVA will eventually be composed of the PLA 9th, 13th and 19th Army<U+2014>totaling 700,000 men<U+2014>by the spring of 1951.<ref>{{harvnb|Chen|1996|p=151}}.</ref><ref name=roe233>{{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=233}}.</ref> On October 11, 1950, Mao authorized the PLA 9th Army to be move from [[Shandong]] province to Manchuria as reserves to the 13th Army in Korea.<ref name=zhang90>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=90}}.</ref> On November 10, 1950, the PLA 9th Army entered Korea in order to reinforce Chinese forces on the east side of [[Taebaek Mountains]].<ref name=applemanc21>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990a|p=21}}.</ref><ref name=zhang110>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=110}}.</ref> This development brings the total PVA strength to 450,000,<ref name=xue349>{{harvnb|Xue|1990|p=349}}.</ref> including 380,000 combat personnel.<ref name=roe233/>

The presence of UN forces at the north of the 38th Parallel, however, prompted the PVA to plan a limited offensive dubbed the "Six Phase Campaign".<ref name=zhang157_158>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=157<U+2013>158}}.</ref> Although the offensive was cancelled on September 4, 1951, it allowed the PLA 20th Army to be deployed in the [[Kumsong (North Korea)|Kumsong]] area by early September.<ref name=zhang157_159_160>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=157, 159<U+2013>160}}.</ref> The PVA had also decided to assume defensive posture on September 4 while postponing all major offensive operations, and the West Coast and East Coast Commands were created to guard against UN amphibious landings as the result.<ref name=zhang160>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=160}}.</ref> Finally, the Chinese Central Military Commission authorized the [[PLA Air Force]] to join the war in September 1951 in response to [[Operation Strangle (Korean War)|Operation Strangle II]] conducted by the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|US Far East Air Force]].<ref name=zhangx145>{{harvnb|Zhang|2004|p=145}}.</ref><ref name=sharder201_203>{{harvnb|Shrader|1995|pp=201<U+2013>203}}.</ref> By the end of October 1951, the total PVA strength in Korea reached 1.15 million men, including 19 infantry corps, nine artillery divisions, five tank regiments, 12 air divisions, four railway engineering divisions and eight logistical corps.<ref name=zhang163>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=163}}.</ref>

With the end [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]] on October 23, 1951 signaling the end of UN limited offensives,<ref name=hermes103_104>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|pp=103<U+2013>104}}.</ref> the Korean front had settled into a period of stalemate.<ref name=hermes104>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=104}}.</ref><ref name=varhola24>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=24}}.</ref> Although the Chinese had lost 36,000 ground troops from the UN offensives, the losses were mostly replaced by the summer of 1952.<ref name=zhang187>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=187}}.</ref> The PVA air forces, on the other hand, suffered major setbacks in constructing airfields in Korea.<ref name=zhangx171/> By late December 1951, all PVA air force personnel were stationed back to China due to the lack of airfields, and its ground support missions were soon abandoned.<ref name=zhangx171/><ref name=zhang179/>

With the front stabilized and no major offensives in planning, the PVA focused its attentions on logistics build up, troop rotations and political controls.<ref name=zhang165_195_224>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=165, 195, 224}}.</ref> In the area of logistics, the Railway Transport Forward Command was established in August 1951, and its Anti-Aircraft Artillery Command Bureau was organized in December 1951.<ref name=zhang175>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=175}}.</ref>  This allowed four additional anti-aircraft artillery regiments to be deployed in Korea.<ref name=zhang174>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=174}}.</ref> The PVA headquarters had also planned to rotate all troops in Korea by the end of 1953, and the Chinese Central Military Commission authorized the PLA 23rd, 24th and 46th Corps to replace 20th, 27th and 42nd Corps by September 1952.<ref name=zhang224>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=224}}.</ref> Finally, the political mobilization programs strengthened the Communist Party's hold on the field units, and mass [[purge]]s were carried out against undesirables while award systems were established for role models.<ref name=zhang195_197_211_213>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=195, 197, 211<U+2013>223}}.</ref>

The armistice negotiations at Panmunjom began to fall apart in September 1952, primarily due to Sino-Korean insistence that all prisoners of war be repatriated to their respective original countries, regardless of their personal preferences.<ref name=hermes279>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=279}}.</ref> As a significant number of Chinese and North Korean POWs had expressed their desire to defect permanently to [[South Korea]] or [[Taiwan]], the demand was met with strong opposition from the United States and South Korea.<ref name=varhola231>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=231}}.</ref> Feeling that the negotiations would soon fail, military commanders on both sides approved numerous tactical plans as means of applying pressure on their opponents.<ref name=hermes282>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=282}}.</ref> In late September, the PVA authorized its frontline troops to conduct tactical strikes against more than 20 UN outposts.<ref name=zhang226>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=226}}.</ref><ref name=cmsab272_273>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000b|pp=272<U+2013>273}}.</ref> The armistice negotiations officially ceased on October 8, 1952.<ref name=hermes281>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=281}}.</ref>

The fighting that followed the collapse of the armistice negotiation were some of the worst of 1952.<ref name=varhola25>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=25}}.</ref> The [[Battle of White Horse]] had crippled four regiments from the PVA 38th Corps, while [[Operation Showdown]] resulted in 11,500 Chinese casualties.<ref name=mal174>{{harvnb|Malkasian|2002|p=174}}.</ref> Despite the heavy losses, the Chinese managed to exhaust the UN forces through two months of [[attrition warfare]], and the [[United Nations Command]] soon renounced all major ground operations for the rest of the war.<ref name=mal174>{{harvnb|Malkasian|2002|p=174}}.</ref><ref name=hermes508>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=508}}.</ref> The front was stabilized once again by November 1952.<ref name=hermes318>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=318}}.</ref>

Despite the success on the ground, the PVA air force was unable to challenge the [[air supremacy]] of the US air force.<ref name=zhangx191>{{harvnb|Zhang|2004|p=191}}.</ref> By May 1953, the US air force were able to launch 22,639 [[sortie]]s per month against North Korean targets, while the PVA air force could only respond with 1,164 sorties during the same time period.<ref name=zhangx193>{{harvnb|Zhang|2004|p=193}}.</ref> The situation was further worsen when the [[Soviet Union]] withdrew 40 percent of its aircraft in the spring of 1953.<ref name=zhangx191/> The North Korean premier [[Kim Il Sung]] began to sue for peace under the constant UN bombardment,<ref name=zhangx189_197>{{harvnb|Zhang|2004|pp=189, 197}}.</ref> and the PVA could only counter by encouraging the North Koreans to continue night bombing missions with [[Po-2]] biplanes.<ref name=zhangx189>{{harvnb|Zhang|2004|p=189}}.</ref>

[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected as the President of the United States on November 4, 1952.<ref name=stu305>{{harvnb|Stueck|1995|p=305}}.</ref> After being elected, Eisenhower promised to end the Korean War with "deeds", not "words", while amphibious exercises were carried out around Korea.<ref name=stu305/> Although Eisenhower had no plans to end the war through military victory,<ref name=hermes367>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=367}}.</ref> the Chinese leadership interpreted those signs as an impending amphibious attack.<ref name=zhang233_234>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=233<U+2013>234}}.</ref> As the result, the PLA 1st, 16th, 21st, 54th Infantry Corps, 33rd Infantry Division and 1st Tank Division were ordered into Korea on December 17, 1952.<ref name=zhang236>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=236}}.</ref> Those new reinforcements soon brought the total PVA strength to 1.35 million men by the summer of 1953.<ref name=zhang257>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=257}}.</ref>

To the surprise of Chinese leadership, the expected UN attack did not occur, and the armistice negotiations was later resumed on April 26, 1953.<ref name=zhang240>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=240}}.</ref><ref name=hermes422>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=422}}.</ref> In order to end the war on favorable terms to the Communist, the reinforced PVA struck 10 UN outposts in early May 1953, while two major offensives were carried out against South Korean forces on June 10 and July 13 respectively.<ref name=zhang240_243>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|pp=240, 243}}.</ref> The resulting clashes soon produced 124,912 Chinese casualties against 60,360 UN losses from May to July.<ref name=hermes447>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=447}}.</ref> The armistice was signed at 10:12 on July 27, 1953,<ref name=hermes490>{{harvnb|Hermes|1992|p=490}}.</ref> and the PVA ended the war with a total of 1.35 million men, including 19 infantry corps, 15 artillery divisions, 9 air force divisions, 10 railway engineer divisions and one [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Public Security]] division.<ref name=xue355>{{harvnb|Xue|1990|p=355}}.</ref> The last Chinese formations left Korea on October 26, 1958.<ref name=cmsab529>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000b|p=529}}.</ref><ref name=zhang270>{{harvnb|Zhang|1995|p=270}}.</ref>
