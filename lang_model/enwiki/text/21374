'''Offshore wind power''' refers to the construction of [[Wind Farm|wind farms]] in bodies of water to generate [[Wind power|electricity from wind]]. Better wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power<U+2019>s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher.<ref name=btm2010o/> 

[[Siemens]] and [[Vestas]] are the leading turbine suppliers for offshore wind power. [[Dong Energy]], [[Vattenfall]] and [[E.on]] are the leading offshore operators.<ref name=btm2010o/> As of October 2010,  3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to [[BTM Consult]], more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the United Kingdom and Germany will become the two leading markets. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the United States.<ref name=btm2010o/>
 
==Definition==
Offshore wind power refers to the construction of [[Wind Farm|wind farms]] in bodies of water to generate [[Wind power|electricity from wind]]. Unlike the term typical usage of the term "offshore" in the marine industry, offshore wind power includes inshore water areas such as lakes, fjords and sheltered coastal areas, utilizing [[Wind_farm#Offshore|traditional fixed-bottom wind turbine technologies]], as well as deep-water areas utilizing [[floating wind turbine]]s.

==History==
Europe is the world leader in offshore wind power, with the first offshore wind farm being installed in Denmark in 1991.<ref name=eesi2010/> In 2008, offshore wind power contributed 0.8 [[GigaWatt]] (GW) of the total 28 GW of wind power capacity constructed that year.<ref>http://www.bwea.com/pdf/publications/CapReport.pdf</ref>
By October 2009, 26 offshore wind farms had been constructed in Europe with an average rated capacity of 76 MW,<ref>''Offshore Wind Energy'', The Windenergie-Agentur Bremerhaven/Bremen, 2009 Issue.</ref> and as of 2010 the [[United Kingdom]] has by far the largest capacity of offshore wind farms with 1.3 GW, more than the rest of the world combined at 1.1 GW<ref name="nef">[http://newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco/view_item?listid=1&listcatid=32&listitemid=4397&section=Wind UK reaches 5GW of installed wind landmark] ''New Energy Focus / [[BWEA]]'',  23 September 2010. Retrieved: 8 November 2010.</ref> The UK is followed by Denmark (854 MW), The Netherlands (249 MW), Belgium (195 MW), Sweden (164 MW), Germany (92 MW), Ireland (25 MW), Finland (26 MW) and Norway with 2.3 MW.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/01/offshore-wind-booming-in-europe??cmpid=WNL-Friday-January21-2011 |title=Offshore Wind Booming in Europe |date=January 20, 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}</ref>

As of October 2010, [[Denmark|Danish]] wind turbine manufacturers [[Siemens Wind Power]] and [[Vestas]] have installed 91.8% of the world's 3.160 MW offshore wind power capacity. Based on current orders, [[BTM Consult|BTM]] expects 15GW more between 2010 and 2014.<ref name="btm2010op">Madsen & Krogsgaard. [http://www.btm.dk/public/Press_DK_Offshore_2010.pdf Press offshore] (in Danish) ''[[BTM Consult]]'', 22 November 2010. Retrieved: 22 November 2010.</ref>

==Technology==
In 2009, the average nameplate capacity of an offshore wind turbine in Europe was about 3 MW, and the capacity of future turbines is expected to increase to 5 MW.<ref name=eesi2010/>  

Offshore turbines require different types of bases for stability, according to the depth of water. A monopile (single column) base, six meters in diameter, is used in waters up to 30 meters deep. In water 20-80 metres deep, a tripod base, or one with a steel jacket is used. [[Floating wind turbine]]s are being developed for deeper water.<ref name=eesi2010/>

Turbines are much less accessible when offshore (requiring the use of a service vessel for routine access, and a [[jackup rig]] for heavy service such as gearbox replacement), and thus [[reliability]] is more important than for an onshore turbine.<ref name="btm2010o"/> A maintenance organization performs maintenance and repairs of the components, spending almost all its resources on the turbines.  Access to turbines is by helicopter or service access vessel. Some wind farms located far from possible onshore bases have service teams living on site in offshore accommodation units.<ref name="dong">[http://www.dongenergy.com/hornsrev2/en/about_horns_rev_2/about_the_project/pages/accomodation_platform.aspx Accommodation Platform] ''[[DONG Energy]]'', February 2010. Retrieved: 22 November 2010.</ref>

The planning and permitting phase can cost  more than $10 million, take 5<U+2013>7 years and have an uncertain outcome.  The industry puts pressure on the governments to improve the processes.<ref>http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/commentary/nj-must-make-wind-farm-permitting-process-as-quick-and-easy-as-possible</ref><ref>http://www.ieawind.org/Annex%20XXIII/Subtask1.html</ref> In [[Denmark]], many of these phases have been deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles.<ref name="emDK">[http://www.energymatters.com.au/index.php?main_page=news_article&article_id=992 Streamline Renewable Energy Policy and make Australia a World Leader] ''Energy Matters'', 11 August 2010.

As of 2010, there are 39 European offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with an operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100, 000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The [[European Wind Energy Association]] has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.<ref name=eesi2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf |title=Offshore Wind Energy |author=[[Environmental and Energy Study Institute]] |date=October 2010 }}</ref>

As of November 2010, the [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] in [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 300 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Horns Rev|Horns Rev II]] (209 MW) in Denmark.

As of 2010, there are no offshore wind farms in the United States. However, projects are under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast.<ref name=eesi2010/>

==Economics and benefits==
Most entities and individuals active in offshore wind power believe that prices of electricity will grow significantly from 2009, as global efforts to reduce [[carbon emissions]] come into effect. [[BTM Consult|BTM]] expects cost per kWh to fall from 2014,<ref name="btm2010op"/> and that the resource will always be more than adequate in the three areas [[Europe]], [[United States]] and [[China]].<ref name="btm2010o">Madsen & Krogsgaard. [http://btm.dk/news/offshore+wind+power+2010/?s=9&p=&n=39 Offshore Wind Power 2010] ''[[BTM Consult]]'', 22 November 2010. Retrieved: 22 November 2010.</ref>

Offshore wind power can help to reduce energy imports, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases (by displacing fossil-fuel power generation), meet renewable electricity standards, and create jobs and local business opportunities.<ref name=eesi2010/>

==Aesthetics==
{{main|Environmental effects of wind power#Aesthetics}}
Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. A 2006 Survey by the University of Delaware near the proposed Cape Wind development found that residents most frequently based their decisions to support or oppose the wind farm on perceived impacts to marine life, the environment, electricity rates, aesthetics, fishing and boating.<ref>http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf</ref>
