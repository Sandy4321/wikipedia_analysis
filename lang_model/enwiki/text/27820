'''Bobby Joe Morrow''' (born [[October 15]], [[1935]]) is a former [[United States|American]] [[athlete]], winner of three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals in [[1956]].

==Biography==
Bobby Joe Morrow was born in [[Harlingen, Texas]] and raised in a farm in [[San Benito, Texas]].  Before becoming a [[Sprints|sprinter]], Morrow played [[American football]] for San Benito High School. Morrow also was a sprinter at [[Abilene Christian University]].

Morrow, who had won the [[1955]] [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] 100 [[Yard|yd]] title, had his most successful season in [[1956]], which led to his choice by [[Sports Illustrated]] as "[[Sportsman of the Year]]."  Morrow won the sprint double in the national college championships and retained his AAU title.  Late in the season, Morrow went to [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne]] as a leader of the American sprint team.  He came back with three gold medals.

First, Morrow was victorious in the 100 [[Metre|m]].  Next, he led an American sweep of the medals in the 200 m, equalling the Olympic Record as well.  As an anchorman for the 4 x 100 m [[Relay race|relay]] team, he won his third gold, setting a [[World Record]] as well. 

After the Olympics, Morrow's success on a national level continued, but he retired in [[1958]]. He made a short comeback before the [[1960]] Olympics, but he failed to qualify for the Olympic team.

After his retirement, Bobby Joe Morrow became a farmer and woodworker.
