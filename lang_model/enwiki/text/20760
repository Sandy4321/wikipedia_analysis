==History==
In June 2008, Nixle partnered with the non-profit organization [[NLETS]], a computer-based message switching system that links together all local, state and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States.

Under the relationship, NLETS houses Nixle servers in their secure facilities and integrates Nixle technology into their network.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nlets.org/strategicpartnerList.aspx | title=PARTNERSHIPS | accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref>

Nixle tested its technology in the winter of 2008 in [[Chula Vista]], California.  The test included publishers from the Chula Vista Police Department, Communications Department and various other Chula Vista municipal agencies.  After the 45 day test, the City of Chula Vista formally became the first municipality to adopt the Nixle platform.<ref>December 16, 2008 {{cite web | url=http://www.chulavistaca.gov/city_Services/Public_Safety/Police_Department/News/details.asp?NewsID=1295 | title=CVPD partners with Nixle to beta test new public notification software system. | accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref><ref>March 23, 2009 {{cite web | url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/local;id=14170 | title=CVPD Using E-Mail and Texts to Communicate With Public. | accessdate=2009-03-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In the Spring of 2009, agencies in eight states tested the new communication platform.  20 municipalities in California gained secure access to the service for testing, including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Napa, California|Napa]], [[San Diego]], [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], [[National City, California|National City]], [[Escondido]]<ref>March 31, 2009 {{cite web | url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2009/03/31/business/doc49d27d48b6ea0300504097.txt | title=TECH: Message service coming to Escondido. | accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref><ref>March 31, 2009 {{cite web | url=http://www.ci.escondido.ca.us/police/nixle/index.html | title=COMMUNITY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM | accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref> and [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]].  

Shortly thereafter, Nixle partnered with [[VeriSign]]'s Messaging and Mobile Media division (now a [[Syniverse]] division). [[Syniverse]] provides Nixle users with short message services ([[SMS]]), or text messaging.<ref>March 24, 2009 {{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS216986+24-Mar-2009+PRN20090324 | title=Nixle and VeriSign Messaging and Mobile Media Enable Police and Municipal Governments... | accessdate=2009-09-22 | work=Reuters | date=2009-03-24}}</ref>

After its partnerships with NLETS, VeriSign, and other firms,<ref>2009 {{cite web | url=http://www.hillardheintze.com/alliances.php | title=Hillard Heintze - Alliance Partners | accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref> Nixle began offering its service to agencies nationwide.  
By the summer of 2010, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, Virginia Beach, Minneapolis, and another 4600 other cities in all 50 states had adopted the program.<ref>October 22, 2009 {{cite web | url=http://bx.businessweek.com/real-time-web/view?url=http%3A%2F%2Fc.moreover.com%2Fclick%2Fhere.pl%3Fr2282951724%26f%3D9791 | title=Nixle, Inc.

==Case studies==
Nixle's public safety alerts have reached residents and communities across the country.

===Chula Vista missing woman===
A senior citizen went out to check the mail and never came back in.  Her husband, worried about her recent episodes, called police. CVPD issued the first of two Alert messages, asking folks to keep an eye out for a disoriented elderly woman wearing yellow shorts. The message was sent within a <U+00BD> mile of her home. 45 minutes later, CVPD sent a follow-up message with a complete description of the woman and a picture, widening out the message distribution area to 2.5 miles. A citizen received the message and saw the woman, allowing CVPD to bring her home safely.<ref>May 8, 2009 {{cite news | url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/05/11/story11.html | title=Nixle software pinpoints geographical areas for messaging - Philadelphia Business Journal | accessdate=2009-09-29 | first=Peter | last=Key | date=2009-05-11}}</ref>

===Civilian tips result in fewer fugitives===
1,062 tips were received in 2009 by Amarillo Crime stoppers which resulted in the apprehension of 44 of the 48 fugitives highlighted by the program, as well as a 126 total fugitive arrests.

Cpl Sean Slover stated that Crimestoppers is working with the online crime-notification program Nixle for dissemination information about crimes and wanted fugitives to subscribers.  The city of Amarillo uses the free service to notify citizens about crimes, fugitives, and emergency situations.

County Sherriff Brian Thomas says "it's an awesome tool...It's a way for citizens to get involved without getting involved.  You have a lot of people in the community that want to help but they're afraid to get involved.  This gives them that avenue to do that."<ref>March 29, 2010 {{cite web | url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/032910/new_news5.shtml | title=Tips Result in Fewer Fugitives | accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>

===Hocking College recommends that students use Nixle services===
After a mysterious, racially-charged death threat was scrawled on a college bathroom, frightened students turned to Dr. Ron Erickson, president of Hocking College in Ohio.

In order to keep the students safe, Dr. Erickson strongly encouraged students to register for Nixle Alerts, which sends messages directly to their emails or cell phones<ref>January 28th 2010 {{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/01/28/2010-01-28_death_threat_looms_over_ohio_college_black_students_fearful_of_feb_2_murder_spre.html | title=Death threat looms over Ohio College; black students fearful of possible Feb. 2 murder spree | accessdate=2010-04-18 | location=New York | work=Daily News | first=Michael | last=Sheridan | date=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>January 26, 2010 {{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhRZDpn7oA8 | title=Dr. Erickson - Message to Community - 01.26.10 | accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>

===Missing 5-year old girl found===
In Sioux County, IA, resident Trevor Schelling received a Nixle alert of a missing 5-year old girl.  While driving in Hull, IA, Schelling spotted the little girl and called the Sheriff's office.  The child was lost about a half mile from home.  She was safe and returned to her mother.

Sioux County Sheriff Altena said that "missing children are always a very scary situation for everybody.  It's great to have more tools, like Nixle, that can be used in situations like this.  The program worked exactly as it was supposed to-the Nixle report of a missing child was put out; a citizen received it on a cell phone text message, saw the child and called 911.  We're very thankful for people like Mr. Schelling."<ref>December 14, 2009 {{cite web | url=http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/article_e0eb0eea-ccdc-5c1d-b49b-38c94b8367e6.html | title=Alert system helps law enforcement warn and inform community | accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>

In Reedsburg Wisconsin a man charged with lewd behavior was apprehended almost immediately after a Nixle alert was sent out to local residents by police department.  Upon arresting Gordon Fitzpatrick, the man charged with exposing himself to three businesses in the summer of 2010, Police Chief Tim Becker stated that Nixle "is free service that is obviously very useful."<ref>August 21, 2010 {{cite web | url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime_and_courts/article_fbe4f1ca-ad92-11df-9f7d-001cc4c03286.html | title=Suspect caught minutes after Reedsburg police send alert | accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>

==Security==
Nixle's servers are all located at [[NLETS]], providing added security from would-be-hackers.  This enables local police departments nationwide to send immediate alerts and advisories using their secure police terminals.

Nixle does not access Nlets' law enforcement information, they access their infrastructure.  Nixle is designed on an emergency-grade platform hosted directly at the Nlets data center in Phoenix, Arizona, which features an on-site diesel generator for power failover, a Cisco firewall system and highly secured and tightly regulated physical access to the facility.  Nixle's partnership with Nlets allows Nixle to provide access to police and fire agencies across the United States on their private network in their vehicle or handhelds without internet access.

==Geographic targeting==
Nixle's technology platform creates a database of community information that builds upon itself. As municipal and community oriented groups push out their location-specific information directly to communities, the system also archives. This creates the foundation for databases of local news and information.

Information is disseminated to any point or address in a desired geographic area.  This technology is also available to consumers.

===Municipal wire===
The municipal wire delivers information exclusively from public safety agencies and municipal governments.  Advertising and other sets of information are not comingled within the Municipal wire so as not to diminish the integrity of public safety and government information.

===Secure group text messaging===
Nixle's Private Messaging application allows agencies and organizations to use the same trusted Nixle platform for public messaging to communicate internally via private groups.  Agencies and organizations can define custom groups and use mobile phone texts messages (SMS) to keep group members up-to-date with real-time messages on mobile phones.  Nixle's Private Messaging application will be rolled out at the multi-nation/multi-agency G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh in September 2009.

===Near time position targeting===
In January 2011, Nixle released an iPhone application<ref>[http://itunes.apple.com/app/nixle/id417438403?mt=8# iPhone Application]</ref> which periodically updates a user's location in its system.  This potentially allows for greater hyperlocality of messages, particularly in relation to users entering their home or business address.  While only a tiny fraction of mobile phones are iPhones that support background location updates, it's a notable step toward achieving the company's vision of being a hyperlocal, real-time messaging platform.
