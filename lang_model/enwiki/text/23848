The '''Hamadryas Baboon''' (''Papio hamadryas'') is a species of [[baboon]] from the [[Old World monkey]] family. It is the northernmost of all the baboons; its range extends from the [[Red Sea]] in [[Egypt]] to [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. Baboons are also native to and live in southwestern [[Arabia]], especially in [[Yemen]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The mountains of Yemen and the [[Horn of Africa]] is a habitat with the advantage for this species of fewer natural predators than central or southern Africa where other baboons reside. The Hamadryas Baboon was a sacred animal to the [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptians]] and appears in various roles in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], hence its alternative name of 'Sacred Baboon'.

==Description==
[[Image:Paviane in langer Reihe2.jpg|thumb|left|adult male (center) with his troop]]
Apart from the striking size difference between the sexes (males are often twice as large as females) which is common to all baboons, this species also shows [[sexual dimorphism]] in coloration. The fur of males is silver-white in color and they have a pronounced cape (mane and mantle) which they develop around the age of ten, while the females are capeless and brown. Their faces range in color from red to tan to a dark brown that older males often exhibit. Males are an average of 30" tall, with tails about 20" long, and weigh an average of about 45&nbsp;lbs. Tails end in small tufts. Infants are dark in coloration and lighten after about one year.  Hamadryas baboons reach sexual maturity at about 51 mo. for females and between 57 and 81 mo. for males.<ref>Rowe, Noel. The Pictorial Guide to Living Primates, Pogonias Press (Charlestown, Rhode Island: 1996)</ref>
The average life span of Hamadryas baboons in the wild is about 35 years.

==Ecology==
{{expand section}}
The Hamadryas Baboon lives in semi-desert areas, savannas and rocky areas, requiring cliffs for sleeping and possibilities to drink water. The Hamadryas Baboon is [[omnivorous]] and is adapted to its relatively dry habitat. It is not discriminating in its search for food, eating  grass, roots, seeds, reptiles, insects, small mammals and crops. Hamadryas baboons will dig for water in dry streambeds. Hamadryas baboons are diurnal.

==Behavior==
[[Image:Papio.JPG|thumb|right|Male and female]]
The Hamadryas Baboon is unusual among baboon and macaque species in that its society is strictly [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[patrilineal]]. Females may try to establish [[matriline]]s but they are usually overruled by the males, who forcefully transfer them among social units and away from their female relatives.<ref name="Sigg and Stolba et al. 1982">Sigg and Stolba et al. 1982</ref><ref>Swedell 2002</ref>  The males limit the movement of the females.  They herd them with visual threats and will grab or bite any female that wanders too far away.<ref name="Swedell and Schreier 2009">Swedell and Schreier 2009</ref>  Males will sometimes raid harems for females, resulting in aggressive fights.  Some males succeed in taking a female from another's harem. This is called a 'takeover'.<ref name="Swedell and Schreier 2009"/><ref>Swedell and Tesfaye 2003</ref><ref name="Swedell 2006">Swedell 2006</ref>  Visual threats are usually accompanied by these aggressive fights.  This would include a quick flashing of the eyelids accompanied by a yawn to show off the teeth.  As in many species, infant baboons are taken by the males as hostages during fights.

The baboon has an unusual 4-level social system called a multi-level society. Most social interaction occurs within small groups called one-male units or [[harem]]s containing one male and up to nine females which the males lead and guard.  A harem will typically include a younger "follower" male who may be related to the leader.<ref name="Swedell 2006"/><ref name="Kummer, 1968">Kummer, 1968</ref><ref name="Stammbach, 1987">Stammbach, 1987</ref>  Two or more harems unite repeatedly to form clans.<ref>Schreier and Swedell 2009</ref>  Within clans, the dominant males of the units are probably close relatives of one another and have an age related dominance hierarchy.<ref name="Sigg and Stolba et al. 1982"/><ref name="Abegglen, 1984">Abegglen, 1984</ref>

Bands are the next level.  Two to four clans form bands of up to 200 individuals which usually travel and sleep as a group.<ref name="Swedell 2006"/><ref name="Kummer, 1968"/><ref name="Abegglen, 1984"/> Both males and females rarely leave their bands. The dominant males will prevent infants and juveniles from interacting with infants and juveniles from other bands. Bands may fight with one another over food, etc. and the adult male leaders of the units are usually the combatants.<ref name="Kummer, 1968"/><ref name="Stammbach, 1987"/> Several bands may come together to form a troop. Several bands also often share a cliff-face which they sleep on.<ref name="Swedell 2006"/><ref name="Kummer, 1968"/><ref name="Abegglen, 1984"/>

==Reproduction==
[[Image:Female baboons with pups.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Female baboons carrying their "younglings"]]
Like other baboons, the Hamadryas Baboon breeds aseasonally. The dominant male of a one-male unit does most of the mating, though other males may occasionally sneak in copulations as well <ref name="Sigg and Stolba et al. 1982"/><ref name="Kummer, 1968"/><ref name="Stammbach, 1987"/><ref>Swedell and Saunders 2006</ref>. Often, a male forms a harem by "adopting" subadult females and teaching them to follow him. He protects them and in 1<U+2013>2 years, they go into estrus and he mates with them.

Females do most of the parenting. They nurse and groom the infant and it is not uncommon for one female in a unit to groom an infant that is not hers. Like all baboons, Hamadryas baboons are intrigued by their infants and give much attention to them. Dominant male baboons prevent other males from coming into close contact with their infants. They also protect the young from predators. The dominant male tolerates the young and will carry and play with them <ref name="Kummer, 1968"/>. When a new male takes over a female, she may go into deceptive estrous cycles. This behavior is likely an adaptation that functions to prevent the new male from killing the offspring of the previous male.

==Human interaction==
Hamadryas baboons often appear in [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian art]], as they were considered sacred to [[Thoth]], a major and powerful deity with many roles that included being the scribe of the gods. [[Astennu]], attendant to Thoth, is depicted as a hamadryas, and was one of the four hamadryas baboons that guarded the lake of fire in [[Duat]], the ancient Egyptian underworld. Sometimes Thoth himself appears in the form of a hamadryas (often depicted carrying the moon on his head), as an alternative to his more common representation as an [[ibis]]-headed figure. One of the roles in which Thoth appears as a hamadryas is as [[Aani]], god of equilibrium, who reported the results of the ''[[Weighing of the Heart]]'' ceremony in Duat.

[[Hapi]], one of the [[Four Sons of Horus]] that guarded the organs of the deceased in ancient Egyptian religion, is hamadryas-headed. Hapi protected the lungs, hence the common sculpting of a stone or clay hamadryas head as the lid of the [[canopic jar]] that held the lungs and/or represented the protection of the lungs. Hamadryas baboons were revered because certain behaviors that they perform were seen as worshiping the sun, and they were viewed as mediators between humans and the gods.

Transformation of field and pastureland represents the main threat to the Hamadryas Baboon, their natural enemies (the [[leopard]] and the [[lion]]) having been nearly exterminated in their range. The [[IUCN]] listed this species as "least concern" in 2008.<ref name="iucn"/>
