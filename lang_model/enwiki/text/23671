The '''Brazilian Intelligence Agency''' ({{lang-pt|'''Ag<U+00EA>ncia Brasileira de Intelig<U+00EA>ncia'''}}; '''ABIN''') is the successor organization to the [[National Intelligence Service of Brazil|Servi<U+00E7>o Nacional de Informa<U+00E7><U+00F5>es]] (SNI) or National Information Service formed during the government of [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco]] in the mid-1960s.

In attempt to bring intelligence agencies under the control of the civilian-led government as part of the process of democratization that began in Brazil in 1985, President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] replaced the SNI with the short-lived (1990<U+2013>94) Secretaria de Assuntos Estrat<U+00E9>gicos (SAE) or Strategic Affairs Secretariat. However, despite the dismissal of 144 SNI officers, the agency continued to be dominated by the military and effective oversight and control of the country's intelligence activities eluded the civilian government.

== Current agency ==
In 1995 President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] placed a civilian at the head of the SAE and subsequently created ABIN. Like many other Latin American nations, Brazil faces the challenge of having to overcome a long history of involvement by the military and their related intelligence arms in domestic politics. Early on, ABIN was tainted by a wiretapping and influence peddling scandal that led to the agency being placed under the direct control of the President and the Institutional Security Cabinet rather than being responsible to the national Congress. This had once again undermined the attempt to reduce the influence of the military on Brazilian intelligence agencies and their practises.

However, successive governments have taken a number of steps to reduce the influence of the armed forces and related intelligence agencies in domestic politics. The relationships between these groups and government in Brazil, so closely intertwined for decades, is evolving. The focus of intelligence agencies appears to be moving slowly from managing internal dissent to focusing on external threats and support of the nation's democracy.

==Wiretapping Suspensions==
On September 1, 2008, President [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] suspended the leadership of the organization, including its director Paulo Lacerda, and ordered an investigation into allegations that appeared in [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] magazine of [[phone tapping]] of senior figures including the heads of both the [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]] and the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Court]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7593265.stm "Lula suspends Brazil spy chiefs" (BBC)]</ref>.

==Current functions==
ABIN's main function is to investigate real and potential threats to the Brazilian society and government and defend the Democratic State of Law, the Brazilian sovereignty and the effectiveness of the public power.

==Motto==
The agency's motto is ''Intelligence for the defense of society, of the democratic Rule of Law and of national interests'' ({{lang-pt|A Intelig<U+00EA>ncia em defesa da sociedade, do Estado Democr<U+00E1>tico de Direito e dos interesses nacionais}}).
