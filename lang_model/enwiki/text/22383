'''''Red Dwarf''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] [[comedy]] [[Media franchise|franchise]], the primary form of which comprises eight series of a television [[sitcom]] that ran on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] between [[1988]] and [[1999]], and which has achieved a global [[cult following]].  It was created and originally written by [[Grant Naylor]] (a so-called '[[gestalt]] entity', in reality a collective [[pseudonym]] for the writing duo [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]]). The show had its origins in a recurring sketch, ''[[Dave Hollins: Space Cadet]]'', in the mid-1980s [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy show ''[[Son Of Clich<U+00E9>]]'', also scripted by Grant and Naylor.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide">{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Chris Howarths & Steve Lyons |title=Red Dwarf Programme Guide |year=1993 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=Section 1: The History |isbn=0-86369-682-1}}</ref>  In addition to the ''Red Dwarf'' television series, there have also been four bestselling [[novels]], two [[Pilot (television)|pilot episodes]] for an American version of the show, and a significant number of tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>

Despite the [[pastiche]] of science fiction used as a backdrop, ''Red Dwarf'' is primarily a character driven comedy, with many off-the-wall science fiction elements used as complementary [[plot device]]s.  For example, in the early series, a recurring source of comedy was the [[The Odd Couple|"odd couple"]] relationship between [[Dave Lister]] and [[Arnold Rimmer]], the two central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other but are trapped together deep in space.

''Red Dwarf'''s highest accolade came in 1994, when an episode from the sixth series ("[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]") won an [[International Emmy|International Emmy Award]] in the Popular Arts category.  The show also won Best BBC Comedy series at the [[British Comedy Awards]] during the same year, and attracted its highest ratings <U+2014> of over eight million viewers<ref>http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_8/aftermath.html</ref> <U+2014> by the eighth series in 1999. In a 2004 BBC poll to find [[Britain's Best Sitcom|Britain's best sitcom]] the show was voted 18<sup>th</sup> out of 100 nominations.

The current status of the show remains uncertain, as Doug Naylor (now in sole control of the franchise following the departure of Rob Grant in [[1995]]) is committed to writing and producing a [[#Red Dwarf: The Movie|feature film]] version of the sitcom.  Naylor has also stated that he hopes one day to tie up the [[cliffhanger]] upon which the eighth series ended, perhaps with a one-off, feature-length [[television special]] although production of a ninth series has not been ruled out, depending on the success of the feature film.

==Plot==
:''See also: [[List of Red Dwarf episodes]]''
The mining ship '''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]''' is a spaceship 6 miles (10&nbsp;km) long, 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) tall, and 4 miles (6&nbsp;km) wide belonging to the Jupiter Mining Corporation. In the first episode, an on-board radiation leak of Cadmium II kills everyone except for low-ranking technician [[Dave Lister]], who is in suspended animation at the time, and his pregnant cat, Frankenstein, who is safely sealed in the cargo hold. Following the accident, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] has to keep Lister in stasis until the background radiation dies down <U+2014> a process that takes three million years.  Lister therefore emerges as the last human being in the universe <U+2014> but not the only life form on-board the ship.  His former bunkmate and immediate superior [[Arnold Rimmer]] is resurrected by Holly as a [[Volumetric display|Hologram]] after the accident to keep Lister sane, while a creature known only as [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|The Cat]] is the last known surviving member of '''[[Felis sapiens|Felis Sapiens]]''', a race of humanoids that evolved in the ship's hold from Lister's cat Frankenstein and her kittens during the millions of years that Lister was in stasis.

The main dramatic thrust of the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth.  Along the way are frequent distractions that usually see the not-so-intrepid ''Dwarf'' crew encountering strange races and lifeforms that have developed in the intervening millions of years.

The crew roster changes as the years go by.  During the second series, the group encounter the sanitation [[mechanoid]] [[Kryten]], rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appears in [[Kryten|one episode]] of series two, but by the beginning of series three he has become a regular character.  At the end of series five, Red Dwarf itself is stolen from the crew, forcing them to travel in the smaller '''[[Starbug]]''' craft for the subsequent two series, with the added side-effect that they lose contact with Holly.  And in series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter-ego from a parallel universe, [[Ace Rimmer]], whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension.  Shortly afterwards, the crew find a replacement for Rimmer when they encounter another parallel version of themselves from a universe in which [[Kristine Kochanski]], Lister's unrequited love, was the person put into stasis and so the last remaining human.  A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in "our" universe, and she is forced to join the crew.

In the eighth (and, so far, final) series, ''Red Dwarf'' itself is reconstructed by the [[nanobots]] that had originally stolen it and broken it down into its constituent atoms.  In the process, the entire crew of the ship <U+2014> including a pre-accident Rimmer <U+2014> are resurrected, but the ''Starbug'' crew all find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's [[brig]] on a set of convoluted charges.  The series ends, however, with ''Red Dwarf'' being eaten away by a virus and all on board evacuated, save for Rimmer who is, in the cliffhanger ending, left stranded alone to face [[Grim Reaper|Death]].

==Characters and actors==
{{main|Red Dwarf characters}}

===Regular characters===
*[[Dave Lister]] played by [[Craig Charles]]. A genial [[Liverpudlian]] (and self-described bum) and the lowest-ranking crew member on the ship (chicken soup machine engineer) before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm on [[Fiji]], but is left impossibly far away by the accident that renders him the last surviving member of the human race.
*[[Arnold Judas Rimmer]] played by [[Chris Barrie]]. Born on the moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], Rimmer is a fussy, bureaucratic, neurotic coward, who is nevertheless judged to have the highest chance of keeping Lister sane when chosen to be the ship's one available hologram.
*[[Cat (Red Dwarf)|The Cat]] played by [[Danny John-Jules]].  A humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat.  In the early series the Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew.  As the series go by, however, he becomes more influenced by his human company, and so begins to resemble a stylish yet dimwitted human.
*[[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] in series I, II, VII and VIII played by [[Norman Lovett]]. [[Hattie Hayridge]] takes over the role for series III to V. The character makes no appearance in series VI. The ship's on-board computer has an [[IQ]] of 6,000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years he/she is left alone after the accident, having developed "computer senility". The change in actor for series III is explained by Holly changing his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe with whom he'd fallen in love.
*[[Kryten]] played by [[Robert Llewellyn]] from series III onwards. Full name Kryten 2X4B-523P. In his original one-off appearance in series II, Kryten was played by [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]. Salvaged by the crew from a crashed spaceship (upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years), and rebuilt by Lister, Kryten is a sanitation mechanoid with an overactive guilt chip. When first encountered by the crew, he is bound by his "behavioural protocols", but Lister gradually encourages him to break his programming and think for himself.
*[[Kristine Kochanski]] in series VII and VIII played by [[Chlo<U+00EB> Annett]]. Kochanski was originally, in series I, II and VI, a supporting character played by [[Altered Images]] vocalist [[Clare Grogan]] (credited as CP Grogan). In the first two series, Kochanski was introduced as a longtime crush of Lister's whom he had never managed to pluck up the courage to ask out on a date. In the first novel, however, she was described as having actually dated him for a month, and this development was [[retcon|retroactively]] introduced into the later series.

===Recurring guest characters===
*[[Red Dwarf characters#Captain Frank Hollister|Captain Frank Hollister]] (played by [[Mac McDonald]]) appears in Series VIII, two episodes of Series I and one episode of Series II.
*[[Red Dwarf characters#Olaf Petersen|Olaf Petersen]] (played by [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]) appeared in two episodes of Series I and one episode in Series II, and is mentioned regularly when Lister talks about the days before the accident, and during his imprisonment in Series VIII.  Typically Lister refers to this character by his surname only.
*[[Red Dwarf characters#Selby and Chen|Selby and Chen]] (played by David Gillespie and Paul Bradley, respectively) appeared in three episodes altogether.
*[[Red Dwarf characters#Kill Crazy|Kill Crazy]] (played by [[Jake Wood]]) and Baxter (played by [[Ricky Grover]]) appeared in several episodes of series VIII.
*[[Red Dwarf characters#Warden Ackerman|Warden Ackerman]] (played by [[Graham McTavish]]) appears in series VIII.
*[[Red Dwarf characters#The Skutters|Bob the Skutter]] is a small maintenance robot and friend to the regular characters.

===Guest actors===
*Actors who played more than one role in ''Red Dwarf'' include [[Tony Hawks]], [[Rupert Bates]] and [[Tony Slattery]]. Guest stars have included [[Brian Cox]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[Nicholas Ball (British actor)|Nicholas Ball]], [[Sarah Alexander]], [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]], [[Gordon Kennedy (actor)|Gordon Kennedy]], [[Mark Caven]], [[Jack Docherty]], [[Lee Cornes]], [[Morwenna Banks]], [[Don Henderson]], [[Don Warrington]], [[Angela Bruce]], [[Koo Stark]], [[Jenny Agutter]], [[Maggie Steed]], [[Jane Horrocks]], [[Geraldine McEwan]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Samantha Robson]] and [[Timothy Spall]].

==Production history==
The first series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1988.  Seven further series have so far been produced, and a [[film]] has been in [[development hell]] almost continually since before the last series in 1999.

===Concept and commission===
The concept for the show was originally developed from the sketch-series ''[[Dave Hollins: Space Cadet]]'' on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[Son of Clich<U+00E9>]]'' in the mid-1980s, written by [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]]. <ref name="The Official Red Dwarf Companion">{{cite book |last=Dessau |first=Bruce  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Official Red Dwarf Companion |year=1992 |publisher=Titan |location=Red Dwarf Genesis |isbn=1-85286-456-7}}</ref>  Some of their influences came from 1970s movies such as ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]'', ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', ''[[Silent Running]]'', and the television series ''[[Lost in Space]]''; but their concept had a large element of British-style comedy and satire thrown into the mix, ultimately moulded into the form of a [[sitcom]].  Having first written the pilot script for ''Red Dwarf'' in [[1983]] during a stay at a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[cottage]] owned by Naylor's father, the former ''[[Spitting Image]]'' writers had hawked their unusual and original script around a number of places but it was rejected by everyone at the BBC for three years, as it was believed a sitcom based around science fiction wouldn't be popular.<ref name="The Official Red Dwarf Companion"/>

However it was finally accepted by [[BBC North]] in [[1986]], <ref name="The Official Red Dwarf Companion"/> a happy result of a spare budget being assigned for a second series of ''[[Happy Families (TV series)|Happy Families]]'' that would never arise. The show was lucky to be remounted after an [[electrician]]'s [[Strike action|strike]] partway through rehearsals shut the entire production down,<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/> and the first episode, ''[[The End (Red Dwarf episode)|The End]]'', finally made it onto screens on [[15 February]] [[1988]].<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>  The creators have long admitted that without the persistence of producers and commissioners such as [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] and [[Peter Ridsdale-Scott]], the series might never have seen the light of day.

===Casting===
[[Alan Rickman]] and [[Alfred Molina]] were two of the notable names that auditioned for roles in the series, with Molina actually being cast as Rimmer originally.<ref name="Interview: Norman Lovett">Interview: Norman Lovett, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 9, November 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, issn=0965-5603</ref><ref name="Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End">Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 1, May 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, issn=0965-5603</ref> However, after having difficulties with the concept of the series, and of his role in particular (it has been said by Doug Naylor that he was constantly wondering when his character would stop being a hologram), the role was recast and filled by [[Chris Barrie]], a professional voice-actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on ''[[Spitting Image]]'', and with the producers on ''[[Happy Families (TV series)|Happy Families]]'' and various [[Jasper Carrott]] productions.<ref name="Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End">Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 1, May 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, issn=0965-5603</ref> [[Craig Charles]], a [[Liverpudlian]] "punk poet", was given the role of Dave Lister. He was originally approached by Grant and Naylor for his opinion about the character 'The Cat' as they were concerned it may be considered by some people as racist.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>  On the television programme 'Comedy Connections', Charles described the character as 'pretty cool' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister. Laconic [[stand up comedian]] [[Norman Lovett]], who had originally tried out for the role of Rimmer,<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/> was kept in the show as the senile computer of the titular [[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|ship]], [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]]. A professional dancer and singer, [[Danny John-Jules]], arriving famously late for his appointment, stood out as [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|The Cat]] immediately. This was partly due to his "cool" exterior, partly due to his dedicated research (reading [[Desmond Morris]]'s book ''[[Catwatching]]''), and partly because he showed up in character, wearing his father's 1950s-style suit.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/> 

Other actors attached to the project with supposed major roles at some stage during the pre-production years of the show include [[Ronnie Barker]], [[Hugh Laurie]], and [[David Baddiel]]. Many who came close to getting leading roles were rewarded with guest parts, including [[Craig Ferguson]], [[Lee Cornes]] and David Gillespie.

===Writing, producing, and directing===
Grant and Naylor wrote the first six series together (using the pseudonym [[Grant Naylor]] on the first two [[Red Dwarf#Books|novels]] and later as the name of their production company, although never on the episodes themselves) before Grant left in 1996, leaving Naylor to write the final two with a group of new writers, notably including Paul Alexander and actor Robert Llewellyn.

For the most part, [[Ed Bye]] produced and directed the series. He left before Series V due to a scheduling clash (he ending up directing a series starring his wife, [[Ruby Wax]]), and Juliet May took over as director, but she parted ways with Grant and Naylor partway through the series for personal and professional reasons. Grant and Naylor took over direction of the series, in addition to writing and producing.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>  Series VI was directed by Andy De Emmony, with Bye returning for the final two series.

Series I, II and III were made by Paul Jackson Productions, with subsequent series produced by the writers' own company [[Grant Naylor Productions]], all for [[BBC North]]; all eight series were broadcast on BBC2. At the beginning of Series IV, production moved from the BBC's [[Manchester]] studios to [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton]].<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/> 

The theme tune and incidental music were written and performed by [[Howard Goodall]], with the distinctive vocals on the theme tune courtesy of [[Jenna Russell]]. Goodall also wrote music for the show's various songs, including "Tongue Tied", with lyrics written by Grant and Naylor,<ref name="Interview: Howard Goodall">{{cite magazine |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Red Dwarf Smegazine |issue=Issue 10 |month=December |year=1992 |publisher=Fleetway Editions Ltd |location=Interview: Howard Goodall |issn=0965-5603}}</ref> which [[Danny John-Jules]] re-orchestrated and released as a Top 20 single. Craig Charles wrote, performed and sang "Cash" <U+2014> from the episode "[[Timeslides]]" <U+2014> with his band. Goodall's own voice can be heard in the version of the song "[[High Noon (song)|High Noon]]" in "[[Queeg (Red Dwarf episode)|Queeg]]" (Series II), and in the "Rimmer Munchkin Song" in "[[Blue (Red Dwarf episode)|Blue]]" (Series VII).  Chris Barrie purports to have been upset by not being invited to sing this song himself (Back from the Dead, series VII DVD); Howard Goodall, however, insists that Barrie was asked but turned the invitation down (Howard Goodall, Settling the Score, series VI DVD).

===Hiatus, changes, and disputes=== 
A period of three years elapsed between series VI and VII, partly due to the imprisonment and subsequent exoneration of Craig Charles on a rape charge, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects (notably Chris Barrie in ''[[The Brittas Empire]]'') and disputes over pay. When the series returned, it was [[filmizing|filmised]] and no longer shot in front of a live audience (a common misconception is that canned laughter was used, when in fact the completed episodes were later shown to an audience), allowing for greater use of four-walled sets, [[location shooting]] and [[Single camera setup|single camera]] techniques. Although some critics praised the higher production values, many fans disliked the series (see "[[Red Dwarf#Mixed reactions|Mixed reactions]]"), and when the show returned for its eighth series two years later, it had dropped use of the filmising process and restored the live audience.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===''Red Dwarf Remastered''===
{{main|Red Dwarf Remastered}}

In 1998, on the tenth anniversary of the show's first airing (and between the broadcast of series VII and VIII), the first three series of ''Red Dwarf'' were [[remastered]] and released on [[VHS]]. The remastering included reformatting the series in 14:9 widescreen (albeit, only for the VHS releases. TV showings were in original 4:3), applying the same 'field-removal' film effect as Series VII, replacing model shots with computer graphics, cutting various small pieces of dialogue (and, in some cases, entire scenes), re-filming Norman Lovett's Holly footage, creating a consistent set of opening titles for use in all episodes, and updating music and ambient sound effects with a digital master. [[Grant Naylor]] explained:

{{cquote|We're basically remastering the whole of the first six series for BBC Worldwide (the video company) who feel that they would be able to sell it more easily in Europe and America if there was a more unified look and feel to the whole of the series. What this means is ... consistent opening titles; it means that in places we can replace and improve the model shots.}}

''[[Red Dwarf Remastered]]'' was met with a generally poor fan reaction in the UK, but significant international broadcast sales - due mainly to the newer-looking visuals and the availability of isolated audio tracks for language dubbing. No further series were remastered and the later DVD releases of the same series reverted to the original versions; although the first episode of Series VII ("[[Tikka to Ride]]") would also include an alternative ''Remastered'' version, featuring upgraded CGI as the only difference to the original broadcast version.

The ''Remastered'' episodes were re-released on DVD on November 12th 2007, as part of the ''Red Dwarf : The Bodysnatcher Collection'' boxset.

==Spin-offs==
===Books===
The franchise has expanded to include four novels, written by the show's creators, Doug Naylor and Rob Grant (under the combined name of Grant Naylor).

* ''[[Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' (published [[2 November]] [[1989]]) <U+2014> Rob Grant, Doug Naylor <U+2014> ISBN 0-451-45201-1
* ''[[Better Than Life|Red Dwarf: Better than Life]]'' (published [[25 October]] [[1990]]) <U+2014> Rob Grant, Doug Naylor <U+2014> ISBN 0-14-012438-1
* ''[[Last Human]]'' (published April [[1995]]) <U+2014> Doug Naylor <U+2014> ISBN 0-14-014388-2
* ''[[Backwards]]'' (published [[2 May]] [[1996]]) <U+2014> Rob Grant <U+2014> ISBN 0-14-017150-9

These novels contain deeper insights and more thorough backstories for the main characters, as well as more information on humanity's future state of affairs.  Rather than adapting the show outright, the books provide yet another, possibly idealized version of the series' backstory.  They reinterpret and reposition elements from past episodes, and even introduce ideas that would later be used in the show.  

It was reported that both authors were working together on a sequel to ''Better than Life'', called ''The Last Human'', but after falling out with each other, and still owing Penguin Publishing two more ''Red Dwarf'' books, Grant and Naylor decided to each work alone on the novels. Two completely different, contradicting sequels were made as a result. ''Last Human'' (by Doug Naylor, who would go on to make two further television series) added Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while ''Backwards'' (by Rob Grant) was more in keeping with the previous two books, borrowing more extensively from established television stories. The styles of these sequels vary wildly from the two predecessors and each other, and gave some insight into which author had been more responsible for different elements and characters in preceding works. While opinion differs strongly on which solo effort is superior, neither matched the widespread fan acclaim of the original co-written novels.

All four books were published in [[audiobook]] format, the first two read by Chris Barrie, ''Last Human'' read by Craig Charles, and ''Backwards'' read by its author Rob Grant.

The [[BBC World Service]] re-recorded the first two books as ''The Red Dwarf Radio Show'', with Chris Barrie narrating and additional sound effects. These re-recordings were abridged versions of the original novels. The first series was broadcast from [[3 December]] [[1995]] to [[17 February]] [[1996]], and the second from [[13 March]] [[1997]] to [[28 March]] [[1997]].

An ''Omnibus'' edition of the first two books, including a few edits to the original text and some extra material such as the original script to the first episode of the TV series, was released in 1992 (ISBN 0-14-017466-4).

Several books containing ''Red Dwarf'' scripts have been published. ''Primordial Soup'' (1993, ISBN 0-14-017886-4) and ''Son Of Soup'' (1996, ISBN 0-14-025363-7) each contain six scripts, and the ''Red Dwarf VIII Scriptbook'' (1999, ISBN 1-85227-872-2) includes all eight episodes from series VIII. An extremely rare short book entitled ''Scenes From The Dwarf'' (ISBN 0-14-600243-1) was released in 1996 as part of the [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] ''60s'' series, containing scripts of a handful of scenes from the series.

''The Log: A Dwarfer's Guide to Everything'' (1997, ISBN 0-14-026862-6), a collection of humorous observations on a wide variety of topics written by Craig Charles and Russell Bell, was not affiliated with Red Dwarf, Grant/Naylor or the BBC. However, Charles was pictured on the cover in costume as Lister and, in the introduction, describes the book (tongue in cheek) as an attempt to ''compile a comparative list of scientific and sociological milestones in the development of the human race'' from the viewpoint of the last human being alive (i.e. someone very much like Lister). This book can therefore be considered an unofficial ''Red Dwarf'' spin-off.

===U.S. version===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:RedDwarfUSA.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Craig Bierko]] as Lister in ''Red Dwarf USA'']] --> 
A [[television pilot|pilot episode]] for an [[United States|American]] version (known to fans as '''''Red Dwarf USA''''') was produced for [[NBC]] in 1992, though never broadcast. The show followed essentially the same story as the first episode of the original series, substituting American actors (including [[Craig Bierko]] as Lister, [[Chris Eigeman]] as Rimmer, and [[Hinton Battle]] as the Cat) for the British; exceptions being Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten, and the British actress [[Jane Leeves]], later of ''[[Frasier]]'' fame, as Holly. It was directed by [[Jeffrey Melman]] and written and produced by [[Linwood Boomer]] of ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' fame.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>

It was later revealed on the series V DVD that Chris Barrie had been offered the chance to reprise his role as Rimmer for the US series, but turned it down believing he would be under contract "for years" afterwards if the show was a success.

It was also revealed that Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, with the support of the cast, convinced the pilot's producers to use a revised script of their creation, but in the course of production the American team reverted back to their original script.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>

As a result of this the two hastily put together an extremely low-budget network promo consisting of scenes from the first pilot and the British show edited in with newly-filmed footage (featuring a new Rimmer and, from a suggestion made by the network, a female Cat, played by [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]). This was also unsuccessful.<ref name="Red Dwarf Programme Guide"/>

Clips from the first pilot can be found on the DVD of series V in the featurette ''Dwarfing USA'', along with interviews with the British cast and Doug Naylor. Bootlegs of the pilots are widely circulated among ''Red Dwarf'' fans, and sold at conventions, while some low-quality recordings can be found on the Internet for downloading.

===''Red Dwarf: The Movie''===
Since the end of series Eight, Doug Naylor has been attempting to get funding to make a feature length film version of the show, but on every occasion so far has been thwarted by circumstances. He has long persisted with his conviction that the making of the movie (for which the script has been written for many years) takes precedence over any other possible future incarnation of Red Dwarf. On the series VIII DVD documentary ''The Tank'', however, he admits to being <U+2014> perhaps mindful of the age and schedules of the principal cast <U+2014> close to having to make a final, outright decision of whether to continue to pursue the film, make a series IX or some one-off TV special(s) (as ''[[Only Fools & Horses]]'' did previously), or simply end the series as it is.<ref>See ''Red Dwarf VIII'' (BBC DVD, 2006), documentary ''The Tank''</ref> Naylor sent a letter to the ''Red Dwarf'' fans at the Dimension Jump convention in 2004, which mostly consisted of his failed attempts to create the film, such as a fake Duke of Manchester offering money to fund the film provided Naylor paid his air fare to attend the meeting. Naylor has also stated that some studios have been impressed by the scripts, but either weren't looking for that kind of project or wanted the film recast.<ref>{{cite news

===Tongue Tied===
The song "Tongue Tied", originally featured in a dream sequence in the series II episode "Parallel Universe", was rearranged and rerecorded by Danny John Jules (under the name 'The Cat') and released as a single in October 1993. It reached number 17 in the UK charts, and was expected to get higher, but a planned performance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' never happened, thus halting momentum for the single. The single also included the actor's performance of the ''Red Dwarf'' theme song.

A video to accompany the release which starred Danny John-Jules as some of his ''Red Dwarf'' alter-egos, including Duane Dibbley, was also produced. This was primarily available to readers of the ''Red Dwarf Smegazine''. It was based around a storyline written by Danny John-Jules and featured music videos for some of the remixes, with guest appearances from the rest of the ''Red Dwarf'' cast, along with [[Clayton Mark]] ("Elvis" in Meltdown) and Charles Augins (Queeg 500 in ''[[Queeg (Red Dwarf episode)|Queeg]]''). In addition an eight-minute "Making Of" documentary featuring the cast was included.

The main melody of the song is also used in background music cues elsewhere in the second series - it appears in rearranged form in the episodes ''[[Stasis Leak]]'' and ''[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|Better Than Life]]'', both of which actually precede ''[[Parallel Universe (Red Dwarf episode)|Parallel Universe]]'' in the broadcast order.

===Specials===
On [[February 14]] [[1998]], the night before the tenth anniversary of the show's first broadcast episode, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] devoted an evening of special programming to the series, under the banner of ''Red Dwarf Night''. The evening consisted of a mixture of new, specially-recorded content and existing material, and was introduced and linked by famed actor and ''Dwarf'' fan [[Patrick Stewart]]. In addition, a series of special take-offs on BBC2's famous [[Station identification|idents]], featuring the "2" logo falling in love with a [[skutter]], were used.

The night began with ''Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg'', a spoof of the popular cookery programme ''[[Can't Cook, Won't Cook]]'', presented by that show's host [[Ainsley Harriott]] (who had himself earlier appeared in ''Red Dwarf'', albeit under heavy make-up, prior to his career as a celebrity chef). Taking place out of the continuity of the series (not least as it features both Kochanski and the hologram Rimmer, who never actually met in the series, on-board ''Starbug''), two teams (Kryten and Lister versus Rimmer and the Cat, although the Cat quickly departs to be replaced by alter ego [[Duane Dibbley]]) are challenged to make the best chicken [[vindaloo]]. The show was part-scripted by Paul Alexander, and part-[[improvised]] by the cast. ''Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg'' is available for viewing as a special feature on the series IV DVD.

After a compilation [[bloopers]] show, featuring out-takes that had already been seen on the various ''Smeg Ups'' releases (see [[#DVD and video|DVD and video]]) but new linking material from the cast, the next special programme was ''Universe Challenge'', a take-off of the ''[[University Challenge]]'' (or ''[[College Bowl]]'' in the USA) format. Hosted by original ''University Challenge'' presenter [[Bamber Gascoigne]] (following an introduction in which Chris Barrie mimicked current host [[Jeremy Paxman]] <U+2014> who Gascoigne subsequently 'blew up' with a Bazookoid), the show saw a team of knowledgeable ''Dwarf'' fans defeat a team consisting of Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Robert Llewellyn, Chloe Annett and Danny John Jules. ''Universe Challenge'' has not yet been released on DVD due to copyright complications.

''Universe Challenge'' was followed by ''The Red Dwarf A-Z'', a half-hour documentary special that chose a different aspect of the show to focus on for each letter of the alphabet. Talking heads on the episode included [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Terry Pratchett]], original producer [[K. Paul Jackson|Paul Jackson]], and Patrick Stewart, in addition to an appearance from two (officially-licensed) [[Daleks]]. Finally, the night ended with a showing of the [[Emmy]] award-winning episode from 1993, ''[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]''. ''The Red Dwarf A-Z'' is available for viewing as a bonus feature on the series II DVD, and as part of some countries' series VII VHS release.

Another one-off ''Dwarf'' special was produced in November of that year <U+2014> a short sketch serving as a prelude to Series VIII that was broadcast as part of the annual [[Children in Need]] fundraising night. The sketch saw the ''Dwarf'' crew (again featuring both Rimmer and Kochanski <U+2014> with Rimmer still sporting his holographic H to avoid spoiling the nature of his return) onboard the newly-redesigned ''Blue Midget'', discussing fund-raising and [[telethon]]s.

===Stage plays===
Blak Yak Theatre, a theatre group in Perth, Western Australia, were also given permission by Grant Naylor Productions to mount stage versions of certain Red Dwarf episodes in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Most notably, the cast featured a Lister speaking with an Australian accent and a white Cat. Tentative plans were also announced by GNP in September 2007 for an official project titled ''Red Dwarf : The Movie : The Stage Play'', but no further information has yet been forthcoming.

==DVD and VHS==
===DVD releases===
All eight series remain available on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4, with each release from Series III onward being accompanied by an original documentary about the making of each respective series, and a bonus disc filled with extra material. The DVD releases have been praised<ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck01/written_up.html Round-up of Series VIII DVD reviews by the official site]. The comments on the extras in these reviews are fairly indicative of the reaction each of the eight releases have received.</ref> for their particularly extensive bonus material, which includes cast commentaries, exhaustive deleted scenes, raw effects footage, previously-broadcast one-offs and specials about the show, outtakes and much more, including <U+2014> in one instance <U+2014> a special audio/part-animated version of an unmade episode, performed by Chris Barrie. In all of the DVDs there are hidden extras among the menus, known as Easter Eggs. These include extra animated interviews with Grant Naylor and Ed Bye, as well as other model shots and unseen footage.<br />
There are also various country-specific releases, usually without extras, across the globe.

Regions 2 and 4 have also seen the release of two ''Just The Shows'', digipack boxsets containing all the episodes from Series I<U+2013>IV (Volume 1) and V-VIII (Volume 2) with static menus and no extras. In October 2006, meanwhile, an [[DVD TV Games|Interactive Quiz DVD]] entitled ''Red Dwarf: Beat The Geek'' was released. The quiz allows "hardcore fans" to compete against casual viewers, in addition to offering general knowledge questions for friends/family not ''au fait'' with the series.<ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck01/dvd_beat_the_geek_210406.html News report on ''Beat The Geek'' release]</ref> The DVD is hosted by Norman Lovett and Hattie Hayridge, both reprising their roles as Holly. It is currently only available in regions 2-4, and in region 2 the initial release also included an internet treasure hunt competition called "Geek Chase",<ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck01/dvd_win_cash_061006.html News report on "Geek Chase"]</ref> with a prize of <U+00A3>5,000. (Now expired, though the game itself remains available online.)

The Region 1, 2(UK) and 4 releases of series 1-3 are the originally aired versions of the show. Some European countries such as [[Poland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[The Netherlands]] have localised releases which contain the ''Remastered'' versions of Series I-III. Bonus features on these DVDs vary. An earlier release in [[Japan]] featured the [[NHK]] versions of the show - remastered and dubbed, but with significantly altered title sequences and shorter running times, reflecting the fact that these edits were originally created for showing on commercial television.

In December 2006, it was announced<ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck01/dvd_remasters_of_the_universe_221206.html "Remasters of the Universe", reddwarf.co.uk]</ref> that a DVD boxset of ''Red Dwarf : Remastered'' was being prepared for release in October 2007.  It was subsequently announced in April 2007<ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck01/dvd_the_bodysnatcher_collection_270407.html "The Bodysnatcher Collection", reddwarf.co.uk]</ref> that the name of the boxset would be ''Red Dwarf : The Bodysnatcher Collection'' rather than ''Red Dwarf Remastered''.  The new title highlighted one of the set's other main bonus features:  a storyboard construction of "Bodysnatcher" (the "lost" episode from series 1, performed by Chris Barrie as for the series VII extra "Identity Within"), notable for being an original 1987 script "finished" by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor in 2007, working together for the first time since 1993.  The intention of the boxset retitling to was to ensure that no buyers or reviewers would mistake the set for a 'vanilla' edition of the 1997 Remastered series (akin to the Just The Shows sets) or even a new 2007 Remastering of the series.  It was felt by GNP that the renaming would focus attention onto the array of bonus features that had not been financially viable when the early series were originally released on DVD.

On Friday 24th August, 2 Entertain confirmed that another Red Dwarf DVD would be released by the end of the year. 'Red Dwarf: Just The Smegs' contains the original video releases of 'Smeg Ups' and 'Smeg Outs' (Out-takes from Series 1 - 6), plus the half hour version shown on 'Red Dwarf Night' and the Series 7 & 8 Smeg Ups released on the original series video releases. The Region 2 DVD will be released on November 5th in the UK.

===VHS releases===
For the initial release of the VHS editions, the videos were named after the first episode on the tape, as were other BBC videos at the time. This was changed for the second half of series I, as the BBC already had another series called ''[[Waiting for God (TV series)|Waiting for God]]'' (the title of the fourth episode in the series) so the video was named after the fifth episode, "Confidence and Paranoia". Because of this, the episode summaries on the back of the tape were mixed up with the second episode being listed first. The first video of series VI was named after the third episode on the tape, presumably because the [[Emmy]]-winning episode "[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]" was seen as being more prestigious than "Psirens", the first episode of the series.

'''Boxed Sets / Speciality Releases''':
Prior to the DVD releases, all eight series had been available on VHS. All the videos are now deleted, but none <U+2014> save for "Six Of The Best" <U+2014> are particularly rare. Three episodes of series VII were also released as special "Xtended" versions with extra scenes and no laugh track (these "Xtended" episodes would later be included on the DVD), while the [[Red Dwarf Remastered|remastered]] versions of series I<U+2013>III were released individually and in a complete box-set. 

A special limited edition box-set, ''Six Of The Best'', was released in 1997, featuring one episode from each (then-existing) series selected by the writers, and an audio CD of discussion and commentary by Rob Grant, Doug Naylor and Ed Bye (this discussion would later be split up and used as extras and [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s on the DVD releases).

'''Outtakes''':
Finally, two [[blooper|outtake]] videos were released, the famed ''Smeg Ups'' in 1994, and its sequel ''Smeg Outs'' in 1995. There was also a specially edited version of ''Smeg Ups'' for the ''Red Dwarf'' anniversary, which featured newly recorded links by Robert Llewellyn as Kryten, Chris Barrie as Rimmer and Craig Charles as Lister, the links were later released separately on the series VII DVD. The original, 1994 version of ''Smeg Ups'' contained outtakes from Series IV<U+2013>VI, with brand new specially-recorded links performed by Robert Llewellyn as Kryten, and featured the never-before-seen original ending of the Series VI finale "Out Of Time". ''Smeg Outs'' featured out-takes from the first three series, with more new links (now also featuring Craig Charles as Lister), in addition to the full-length video for "Tongue Tied". These videos were a strong commercial success, and ''Red Dwarf'''s outtakes remain among the most famous in television. All the out-takes featured on the videos have now been included on the relevant DVDs, and will be released in their original form on DVD on November 5th (In the UK) as 'Red Dwarf: Just The Smegs'.

===Releases on other media===
''Smeg Ups'' was re-released on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] in June 2006, with ''Smeg Outs'' originally intended to follow 'for Christmas',<ref>[http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck01/future_echoes.html Information on future DVD releases]</ref> but that release was subsequently cancelled.

Meanwhile, three episodes <U+2014> "[[Marooned (Red Dwarf episode)|Marooned]]", "[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf episode)|Quarantine]]", and "[[Cassandra (Red Dwarf episode)|Cassandra]]" <U+2014> are also available to view on selected mobile phones on a "ROK Chip".

Some episodes have also been made available to certain countries by the BBC for download through the [[Vuze]] client.

==Notable series characteristics==


===Mixed reactions===<!-- This section is linked from [[Red Dwarf]] -->
The many changes that were made to the series' cast, setting, creative teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans as to the quality of certain series. Series VI was based around the supply ship ''Starbug''. In the opening show of the series, "Psirens", the reason given by Rimmer was that Red Dwarf was stolen after Lister had forgotten which planetoid he had parked it on. However there was a real reason for the change <U+2014> too much of the ''Red Dwarf'' set did actually go missing. Series VI is often regarded as a highlight for lovers of one-line jokes but some saw it as a continuation of the 'Monster of the week' philosophy of Series V, which was nevertheless visually impressive. In Series VII and VIII there was a discernible shift away from both 'Monster of the week' and the stereotypical antagonism between Lister and Rimmer.

Series VII was seen by many as a disappointment: while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from outright [[sitcom]] and into something approaching [[comedy drama]] did not impress a significant number of long-standing fans.  Furthermore, the attempt to then shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm <U+2014> and at times downright hostile <U+2014> by many fans who felt that the level of humour in that series was far below that which they had come to expect from the show. There was also a significant amount of criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of ''Red Dwarf'', as many felt this detracted from the series' central premise of [[Dave Lister|Lister]] being the last human being alive.<ref>[http://www.ganymede.tv/indepth/under-fire Ganymede & Titan - "Under Fire"], 4 April 2003</ref>

On the other hand, there are other ''Red Dwarf'' fans who feel that Series VII and VIII, either separately or as a whole, are no weaker than the earlier series, and the topic is therefore the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.<ref>[http://www.ganymede-titan.info/articles/likevii.php Ganymede & Titan - "Why I Actually Like Series VII"], 7 November 2004</ref> Similar discussions revolve around the quality of Series VI (seen by some as the strongest series, but by others as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting), although not to the same extent; and there are even those who argue that the show lost its way with the significant changes made after Series II.

Within the context of British comedy in general, meanwhile, ''Red Dwarf'' occupies an ambiguous position. While revered by many <U+2014> and still a successful programme, as recent DVD sales have shown (series IV and V were the third and fourth best-selling BBC DVDs respectively in 2005<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2005/06_june/annual_review_2005.shtml BBC report on DVD sales], 6 June 2005</ref>) <U+2014> it is also often looked down upon by those in the comedy fraternity (comedians such as [[Armando Iannucci]] and [[Lee and Herring]] have remarked on their dislike for the series){{Fact|date=August 2007}}. This could be the result of any number of factors <U+2014> its [[niche market|niche]] content, the fact that its writers largely worked alone and are noted for little else in the industry, or the 'unfashionable' status of its main cast members (consisting of a dancer, a poet, an impressionist, and a stand-up comic, rather than previously-noted comedic actors) and the science fiction setting. Despite this, ''Red Dwarf'' consistently topped ratings (e.g. the series VIII opener "Back in the Red" received 8.05 million viewers when first broadcast in February 1999<ref>Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb)/RSMB, taken from ''The Radio Times'', week 20-26 Feb 1999</ref>), and remains one of the longest-running BBC2 comedy series.

===Invented words===

''Red Dwarf'', like many other science fiction series, developed its own distinct vocabulary. Words and phrases such as [[Hologrammatic]], [[Dollarpound]], [[Felis sapiens]], Fuchal, [[Red Dwarf characters#Simulants|Rogue Simulants]], [[GELF]], Space weevil and Zero G Football appear at various points during the series, highlighting a development in language, political climate, technology, evolution and culture in the future.

The series also famously employed a vocabulary of fictional expletives in order to avoid using potentially-offensive [[expletive]]s in the show, and to give nuance to futuristic colloquial language. By far, the most famous example is '[[smeg (vulgarism)|smeg]]'. The word can be considered a substitute for either "[[shit]]" or "[[fuck]]" depending on circumstance, and so variations of the word include 'smeghead', 'smeg off' and 'smegging hell'. Grant and Naylor have stated that they invented the word "smeg", and that it has no connection with any similar real words, such as '[[smegma]]' or the brand name that appears on the front of kitchen appliances. However, [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] Tony Thorne, in his 1990 ''Dictionary of Contemporary Slang'' (ISBN 0-7475-2856-X), reports instances of 'smeg' (and derivatives) being used as a term of 'mild contempt and even affection' among 'schoolboys, students and punks' as early as the mid-1970s <U+2014> a decade or so prior to the inception of the ''Red Dwarf'' phenomenon <U+2014> and unequivocally traces the [[etymology]] of the term back to '[[smegma]]'. A character in the 1978 [[DEVO]] promotional video "The Men Who Make The Music" employs the term in the line "You're dying under Daddy's Cap, Smeghead."

Other invented expletives and [[euphemism]]s include 'goit' (one who is annoying or awkward), 'gimboid' (one who is stupid or clumsy) and 'twonk' (one who is lacking intelligence). Another term of abuse used once in the show was the word 'gwenlan', the last name of Gareth Gwenlan, a former [[BBC]] head of comedy who had once passed on the show.

===Parody and pastiche===
While ''Red Dwarf'' is a comedy series, there is a mistaken belief that it exists solely as a 'parody' of existing science fiction shows. This, however, is untrue <U+2014> the science fiction elements of the series were always treated seriously by Grant and Naylor, and indeed there were many concepts introduced by the series that would later go on to be used by more "serious" programmes. Nevertheless, like many sitcoms of its era, a number of its episodes contained references to other (not always science fiction) television shows, films, books and plays. These included spoofs of films and TV programmes as diverse as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Neighbours]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]'', ''[[Doctor Doolittle]]'' and ''[[Pride and Prejudice (film)|Pride and Prejudice]]''.

===Continuity===
''Red Dwarf'' is particularly known for its creators' lax attitude towards continuity. As such, there were many facts and events that go contradicted (sometimes multiple times) from series to series. In the beginning, changing such things as the number of people on-board the ship (Originally 169, later became 1169), the number of times Rimmer took his astronavigation exam, or even what century Lister was from (In the 1st & 2nd series Lister was from the mid 21st century, but in the series 4 episode "Justice" Lister claims to be from the 23rd century), was a result of Grant and Naylor not bothering to check their facts because they assumed that no-one else would either. Perhaps the best-known example involved Lister having been said to have already had his [[appendix]] removed in an episode in series II, only to suffer from [[peritonitis]] and have it removed during series VI, an error that has received numerous attempts at explanation by writers and fans alike (most famously during the ''Smeg Ups'' video, when Kryten declared that Lister "liked the operation so much, he decided to have it again"<ref>''Smeg Ups'', BBC Video, 1994</ref>). Once the show began to attract a quite large fan base, however, such errors began to be gleefully pointed out by fans the world over, to the extent that they became one of the series' most notable features. Most of the series' continuity errors are therefore now treated with a certain amount of tongue-in-cheek reverence, and cheerfully ignored (just as Grant and Naylor ignored them when writing the show).
