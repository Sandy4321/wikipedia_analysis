'''Monument Square Historic District''' is a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] on Main and Water Streets, and Grove Avenue in [[Leominster, Massachusetts]]. The district includes Leominster's traditional [[town common]] or square, which is known as "Leomister Square" or "the Common." 

Leominster's common is the site of several monuments, including: a monument marking the site of the town's second meeting house from 1775-1824 (which was replaced by the first town house), a Native American mortar (moved to the site in 1880), several veterans' memorials, and a firefighters' memorial. The Leominster Historical Society headquarters is adjacent to the square. 

In 1743 the common was chosen as the site of the "First Church" meeting house in Leominster. At that time, an active church congregation was required for a town to gain a charter from the Massachusetts government. Originally a [[Congregationalist]] ([[Puritan]]) congregation, First Church's members later adopted a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology in the early 19th century, causing the traditional Reformed ([[Calvinist]]) members to leave the building and found what is now Pilgrim Congegational Church, also located on the common. The First Church congregation was funded with state tax revenue until 1835, when Massachusetts separated its churches from state funding.<ref>Mark Bodanza, Leominster Champion, 1/23/2009 (Neighborhoods), "First Church has rich history,"http://www.leominsterchamp.com/news/2009-01-23/neighborhoods/020.html</ref>

The historic district also contains many 19th-century  buildings, and the area was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982. The city hall and various churches and businesses are adjacent to the square.
