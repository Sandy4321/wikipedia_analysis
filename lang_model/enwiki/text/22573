''To prevent confusion and double counting, information in this table is updated only once a tournament or the player's participation in the tournament has concluded. This table is current through to the end of the 2010 French Open.
<!--if you cannot understand the italicized note, it just means WAIT until he exits in the tournament, either with a win or a loss so an editor can do it in just one go. and in updating numbers, include the update of tournaments played, finals reached and won, surface win-loss, overall win-loss, and these numbers in the career column, as well as the win-loss in the footnote. -->
