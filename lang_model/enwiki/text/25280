This '''list of tallest buildings in Chicago''' ranks skyscrapers in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] by height. Chicago has the tallest building in the [[United States]], the [[Sears Tower]], and many other tall buildings, mostly in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] or along the [[Magnificent Mile]]. The [[Sears Tower]] also has the most floors of any completed building in the world, and if one includes its 278-foot (85 m) tall western antenna, remains the world's tallest completed [[skyscraper]].  In addition, Chicago has the distinction of being the only city in the world with more than one building containing at least 100 floors ([[New York City]] had 3 such buildings from 1973-2001). The [[John Hancock Center]], with 48 floors of [[condominiums]] from the 45th floor to the 92nd floor in between business and [[restaurant]] spaces, holds the world record for the highest residential floor.

Chicago was the site of what is generally considered the world's first steel&ndash;frame skyscraper, the [[Home Insurance Building]], built in 1885 with 10 floors (later 12) and demolished in 1931.

The city has 89 buildings rising over 500 feet (152 m) inside its city limits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?31949868|title=Diagram of Chicago skyscrapers|accessdate=2007-11-17|publisher=SkyscraperPage.com}}</ref> second in [[North America]] only to [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|New York City]]. 

==Tallest buildings==
This lists ranks Chicago skyscrapers that stand at least 500&nbsp;feet (152&nbsp;m) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height.

<sup>1</sup> This building was destroyed by the [[Great Chicago Fire]] in 1871, and replaced by the current cathedral of the same name in 1875. 

<sup>2</sup> The clock tower on this building was removed in 1895, allowing a shorter building to become the tallest in the city. 

<sup>3</sup> This building is currently 282 feet (86 m) tall, following the removal of a pyramid top and sculpture.

==Tallest buildings in Chicago's suburbs==

A few high-rise buildings are scattered throughout Chicago's suburbs, with the densest concentrations in Evanston, Schaumburg, and the Interstate-88 corridor around Oak Brook. Buildings listed in italics are under construction.
