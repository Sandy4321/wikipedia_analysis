The '''Principality of Pindus and Voivodship of Macedonia''' (also ''Pindo'' or ''Pindos'', sometimes ''Pindus and Moglena''; {{lang-el|<U+03A0><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03B3><U+03BA><U+03B9><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03BF> <U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+03A0><U+03AF><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C5>}}; {{lang-it|Principato del Pindo}}; {{lang-rup|Printsipat di la Pind}}) was an attempt to establish an autonomous [[puppet state]] set up under [[Fascism in Italy|fascist]] [[Italy|Italian]] control in northwest [[Greece]] in the regions of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Thessaly]] and [[West Macedonia]] during [[World War II]].<ref>Poulton, Hugh. 2000. Who are the Macedonians? Indiana University Press. Pp. 111</ref> It was proclaimed during the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Italian occupation of northern Greece]] in the summer of [[1941]] as the fatherland of ethnic [[Aromanians]], but was never able to assert itself over the local population until its ''de facto'' disbandment in 1944.<ref>{{gr icon}}[http://www1.rizospastis.gr/columnPage.do?publDate=7/9/2003&columnId=342 The capitulation of Italy] from ''[[Rizospastis]]'' newspaper, 7 September 2003</ref> The capital of the statelet was [[Metsovo]] (''Aminciu'' in Aromanian), but the national assembly sat in [[Trikala]].

==History==
{{seealso|Axis Occupation of Greece}}

The concept of an autonomous Aromanian (Vlach) state in the [[Pindus]] area was initially promoted by [[Romania]] from the 1860s onwards. The first attempt to realize this goal was undertaken by  [[Alchiviad Diamandi di Samarina]], who in 1917 founded the "Republic of Pindus" in then Italian-occupied southern [[Albania]].<ref name=Romanian>{{gr icon}} [http://www.almyros.vlahoi.net/propaganda.htm Romanian Propaganda], from the Vlach Association of Almyros Province</ref> Although the statelet survived for only a day, it signalled the beginning of Diamandi's association with the Italians in pursuit of his aims.

After the [[Battle of Greece|fall of Greece]] to the Germans in spring 1941 and the division of the country among the Axis powers, Diamandi created a [[Separatism|separatist]] organisation known as the ''Fifth Roman Legion'', with the support of the Italian occupation authorities. Diamandi established himself as prince at Aminciu, and hoped for the creation of a state that would encompass all of north-western Greece.<ref name=Romanian/><ref>The Pindus region also spans southern parts of present-day Albania and the Former Yugoslav [[Republic of Macedonia]], but the "Principality" was restricted to the areas under Greek rule.</ref> Diamandi also met the Greek collaborationist Prime Minister, [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], but Tsolakoglou refused to accommodate his demands.<ref name=Romanian/>

In 1942 a faction of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (VMRO) offered the throne of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to Alchiviad, but there is no evidence as to whether he accepted it; however, his last successor, Julius I, was always styled as Voivode of Macedonia. Alchiviad eventually left the state in June of [[1942]], and took refuge in Romania because in the eyes of local Aromanians he was rather pro-Italian than pro-Aromanian, while the Italians considered him a Romanian agent. His successor for a very short time was [[Nicola Matushi]] from [[Samarina]], who tried to find a ''modus vivendi'' with the Greek leaders, but without success. After the liberation of Greece in October 1944, Matushi also left for [[Bucharest]].<ref>{{gr icon}} [http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=12764&m=S05&aa=1 <U+0397> <U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7> <U+039E><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7>], from the ''[[To Vima]]'' newspaper</ref> From mid-1942 on, the armed [[Greek Resistance]] also made its presence felt, fighting against the Italians and their collaborators.

In late 1942, the Italian occupation authorities, which previously had supported mostly Aromanian and [[Albanians in Greece|Albanian]] groups, changed their attitude towards the local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population. According to a source from the old pre-communist Bulgarian National Security Service, this change was due to the decisive intervention of the leader of [[VMRO]] [[Ivan Mihailov]] through [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] in [[Rome]] in early 1943{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. Then the vacant title was offered to the [[Cseszneky]] family, probably in recognition for their role in supplying the [[Italian Army]] with cereals. [[Gyula Cseszneky]] was a Hungarian-Croatian aristocrat<ref>[http://ferenczygen.tripod.com/id6.html Hungarian Aristocracy - Barons]</ref> in Italian service, who only nominally reigned as ''Voivode Julius''<ref>[http://starnarcosis.net/obsidian/soubalk2.html Regnal Chronologies: Northern Greece]</ref> between August-September in 1943, but never actually assumed power, although some local pro - [[Bulgarian]] autonomist leaders  from [[Ohrana]] governed in his name.<ref>Be<U+0161>ker, Inoslav: I Morlacchi nella letteratura europea. Il calamo, Roma 2007, ISBN 9788889837405.</ref> Whatever authority the Principality exercised, it practically ceased to exist after the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943, when the area was taken over by the Germans.

Another important figure in the history of the state was the Aromanian[[Vasil Rapotika]] (Vasilis Rapoutikas).<ref name=Romanian/> According to V. Papagianni, he was Minister of Defence in the autonomous government since its creation. After Matushi's departure Rapotika was not loyal to the Italians, but rather offered his services to the Germans, particularly after the Italian occupation forces had started to arm local Macedonians. He was shot dead by a Greek guerilla group just outside [[Larissa]]. The Greeks then tied his corpse on the back of a donkey and paraded him through the Aromanian villages of the Pindus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} This was intended in order to scare the local population and as a final proof that the Principality had reached its end.

Another commander was [[M. Hatzi]] who was recognized by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German authorities]] in 1944 as leader of their local supporters. In September 1944 the above mentioned Ivan Mihailov was offered by the Germans to head a future [[Independent State of Macedonia]] but he declined favouring the occupation of Vardar Macedonia by [[Bulgaria]].

==Internal policies==
Due to the chaotic political and military situation the succession rules were not set. Nevertheless, it seems that the Principality was an [[Elective monarchy|elective]] and not a [[hereditary monarchy]].

The state adopted certain anti-Greek policies but unlike other fascist r<U+00E9>gimes of the time was not [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jews]] from [[Kastoria]], [[Veria]], and [[Ioannina]] held top positions in the hierarchy of the Principality. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
