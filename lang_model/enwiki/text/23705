==Provincial politics==
Letnick began positioning himself in April 2008 to run for provincial office, informing his MLA [[Sindi Hawkins]] who had been diagnosed with cancer, that he would seek to replace her if she did not seek re-election.<ref>{{cite news |title=City councillor hints at provincial run |last=Nieoczym |first= Adrian |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= July 15, 2008 |page=7}}</ref> However, it was retiring MLA [[Al Horning]] in a neighbouring riding that asked Letnick to replace him.<ref>{{cite news |title=City councillor to seek a Liberal nomination |last=Smith |first= Jennifer |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= September 13, 2008 |page=4}}</ref> Letnick accepted and, as no one else contested, he was acclaimed BC Liberal candidate in the [[Kelowna-Lake Country (provincial electoral district)|Kelowna<U+2014>Lake Country]] riding.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-city councillor secures a Liberal nomination |last=Nieoczym |first= Adrian |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= November 27, 2008 |page=13}}</ref> In the May 2009 election, Letnick defeated the New Democratic candidate Matthew Reed who was an audio engineer and instructor,<ref>{{cite news |title=Reed runs in Kelowna-Lake Country |last=Nieoczym |first= Adrian |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= March 24, 2009 |page=1}}</ref> the BC Conservative Party candidate Mary-Ann Graham who was a [[Rutland, British Columbia|Rutland]] caf<U+00E9> owner, the Green Party candidate Ryan Fugger who was a freelance software and web developer, and independent candidate and fruit farmer Alan Clarke.<ref>{{cite news |title=Letnick takes on all comers armed with Liberal policies |last=Nieoczym |first= Adrian |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= April 16, 2009 |page=3}}</ref> Letnick won his riding with 52% of the vote and his BC Liberal Party won its third consecutive majority government.

As the [[39th Parliament of British Columbia|39th Parliament]] began, Premier Gordon Campbell did not include Letnick in the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|cabinet]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Two local MLAs given cabinet posts |last=Waters |first= Alistair |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= June 10, 2009 |page=1}}</ref> For the first two sessions Letnick was appointed to serve on two committees: the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services. As part of the finance committee he traveled the province for public consultation regarding government budget prioritization. In the third and fourth sessions he was re-assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Education and the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills - though neither committee was convened in third session and only the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills held a meeting in the fourth session. In Fall 2009 Letnick was appointed by [[Randy Hawes]], fellow BC Liberal MLA and the Minister of State for Mining, to lead a committee investigating a management strategy for aggregate extraction and processing in the Central Okanagan area.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gravel pit critics get their wish |last=Luciw |first= Jason |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= September 22, 2009 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=As year comes to a close, gravel pits continue to be a concern |last=Simmons |first= Mike |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= December 22, 2010 |page=26}}</ref> 

Letnick distinguished himself from the BC Liberals in November 2009 when he voted against their ''Assistance to Shelter Act'' which allowed police to use force in taking a person at risk to emergency shelters. Letnick voted against the bill as "a matter of conscience" saying that he supported the current methods used and that the act may dis-locate persons into unfamiliar parts of town without a means to return.<ref>{{cite news |title=Letnick goes rogue on Liberals |last=Waters |first= Alistair |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= November 12, 2009 |page=12}}</ref>

Letnick was a vocal proponent of independent power producers<ref>{{cite news |title=Thirst for power means finding green alternatives |last=Letnick |first= Norm |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= May 16, 2009 |page=25}}</ref> and of the Harmonized Sales Tax,<ref>{{cite news |title=Local MLA says he plans to vote to keep the HST in place |last=Letnick |first= Norm |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= June 17, 2011 |page=1}}</ref> though he was forced to deliver a local petition against the HST to the Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{cite news |title=Record hunt turns up no pre-election HST chat |last=Kines |first= Lindsay |coauthors=Les Leyne and Rob Shaw |newspaper=[[Times Colonist]] |location=[[Victoria, British Columbia]] |date= September 20, 2009 |page=7}}</ref> The unpopularity of the HST within his riding led to Letnick being included in a list of 24 MLAs, in June 2010, who the FightHST group would explore for potential recall.<ref>{{cite news |title=Local MLAs on HST hit list |last=Waters |first= Alistair |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= June 24, 2010 |page=1}}</ref> The group short-listed Letnick in their list of 18 MLAs, in September 2010, where they thought recall was possible<ref>{{cite news |title=Island MLAs on anti-HST recall hit list |last=Shaw |first= Rob |newspaper=[[Times Colonist]] |location=[[Victoria, British Columbia]] |date= September 21, 2010 |page=1}}</ref> <U+2014> though the group did not follow through with the recall campaign with Letnick.

Following the resignation of party leader [[Gordon Campbell]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party leadership election, 2011|BC Liberal Party leadership election]] was held. Letnick endorsed [[George Abbott (politician)|George Abbott]] as soon as he entered the race, citing the respect Abbott has of people within and outside the party.<ref>{{cite news |title=Letnick aligns himself with Abbott in leadership race |last=Waters |first= Alistair |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= November 26, 2010 |page=9}}</ref> [[Christy Clark]] won the leadership election and became Premier, but also did not include Letnick in her [[Executive Council of British Columbia|cabinet]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Stewart loses cabinet ministry posting |last=Waters |first= Alistair |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= March 15, 2011 |page=1}}</ref> However, Clark directed Letnick to chair the Select Standing Committee on Health with the specific task of assessing the sustainability of the health care system, given expected demographic trends, to 2036 and to report on potential alternative strategies.<ref>{{cite news |title=Navigating the 'boomer glacier' impact on health care |last=Letnick |first= Norm |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date= July 8, 2011 |page=1}}</ref>

In May 2011, Letnick introduced a private member bill called the ''Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act'' [http://www.leg.bc.ca/39th3rd/1st_read/m210-1.htm (M-210)] into the Legislative Assembly. The bill would have enabled 
people, like emergency workers or victims of crimes, to obtain blood tests from people who had their bodily fluids come in contact with them. Letnick cited encouragement from fire fighters and paramedics, as well as a Clark campaign pledge to debate more private member bills, as reasons for bringing the proposed legislation forward.<ref>{{cite news |title=Blood test bill introduced to protect emergency workers |last=Sherlock |first= Tracy |newspaper=[[Times Colonist]] |location=[[Victoria, British Columbia]] |date= June 2, 2011 |page=4}}</ref>

{{quote|Currently emergency workers and victims of crime who suspect they have been exposed to serious illness cannot determine their exposure until many months later, often past the window of preventative treatments. Because of this doubt, suspected exposed people usually ingest a concoction of prophylactic drugs, and they, with their families, carry the mental burden of uncertainty. This bill allows those individuals to ask the authorities to compel source individuals to get a blood test in a timely manner and, if a communicable disease is determined, to have the source individual's doctor communicate the results in confidence to the applicant's doctor.|Norm Letnick May 31, 2011<ref name=hansard>{{cite hansard |url= http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/39th3rd/H10531p.htm |house=[[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] |date= May 31, 2011 |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref>}}

The legislation only received first reading in the third session but Letnick brought it back in the fourth session as [http://www.leg.bc.ca/39th4th/1st_read/m204-1.htm Bill M-204] in November 2011.
