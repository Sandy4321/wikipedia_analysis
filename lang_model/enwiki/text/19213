The '''Two Harbors Light''' is the oldest operating lighthouse in the [[United States|US]] state of [[Minnesota]].  Overlooking [[Lake Superior]]'s [[Agate Bay]], the lighthouse is located in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]]. The construction of the Lighthouse began in 1891. The construction of the lighthouse was completed in 1892, the first lighting of the Two Harbors light was on April 14, 1892. The first Two Harbors keeper was Charles Lederle and there were normally three keepers assigned to make sure the light was lit every day. The Lighthouse was built to provide safe passage into the Agate Bay Harbor during the early 20th century, as Two Harbors was a major shipping point for the iron ore of the Mesabi Range.

The {{convert|49.6|ft|adj=on}} tower is made of red brick and the head keeper's residence is attached, it towers {{convert|78|ft}} from the lake level to the top and in {{convert|12|ft}} squared. The walls of the tower were built to be 3 bricks thick and the walls where the tower and house meet are a full 5 bricks thick. This was for the safety of the keeper's family.  The light has a total of six structures, a lighthouse tower with attached keeper's quarters, an assistant keeper's house, a fog signal building, an oil house, a skiff house and a garage.  The lighthouse was originally equipped with a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]].

In 1969 the Coast Guard removed the Fresnel lens and replaced it with a {{convert|24|in}} [[DCB-224|DCB-224 aerobeacon]] which is still used today. The light shines an average of {{convert|17|nmi}}.  The original lens is now at the [http://www.inlandseas.org/ Inland Seas Maritime Museum].  The Lake County Historical Society began to provide tours of the Lighthouse Station in 1988 when it was granted a lease by the U.S. Coast Guard.  In 1999 ownership was transferred to the Lake County Historical Society and the Society assumed responsibility for the operation of the light in 2001. While the lighthouse is still on the Light List<ref name=uscgll/> as active, it is listed as a private aid to navigation and is no longer maintained by the Coast Guard.

Three of the lighthouse station's buildings are open for visitors to tour:
*the Lighthouse Tower which has been restored and houses the rotating light
*the Assistant Keeper's building which has been restored to the late 19th century era and has exhibits about Lake Superior shipwrecks, the development of Agate Bay and a kiosk with historical information on the area
*the Keeper's Quarters of the Lighthouse have been restored to the early 20th century era which the Lake County Historical Society operates as a [[bed and breakfast]].
Also, on the site is the Pilothouse from the Frontenac ore boat, which contains an exhibit on its history and shipwrecks. The lighthouse was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 19, 1984 as '''Two Harbors Light Station''', reference number 84001483.
