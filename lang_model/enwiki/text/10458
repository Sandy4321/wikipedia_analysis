'''Hermes Fran<U+00E7>a Barros''' ({{IPA-pt|<U+02C8>e<U+0281>mi<U+0283> <U+02C8>f<U+027E><U+0250><U+0303>s<U+0250>}}; born August 26, 1974) is a former [[Brazil]]ian [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]]. He has competed for the [[UFC]], [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], [[Maximum Fighting Championship|MFC]], and [[Israel FC]]. He is a former [[List of WEC champions#Lightweight Championship|WEC Lightweight Champion]], and former [[UFC Lightweight Championship]] contender.

== Mixed martial arts career ==

===Early career===
Fran<U+00E7>a made his professional Mixed Martial Arts debut in 17 November 2001, with a win over future [[List of UFC Champions#Featherweight Championship|WEC Featherweight Champion]] [[Mike Brown (fighter)|Mike Brown]].  He quickly earned an undefeated streak of 6-0, finishing all his opponents under the limit of the second round, drawing the attention of the [[UFC]].

===First UFC run===
Fran<U+00E7>a made his UFC debut at ''[[UFC 42]]'', defeating [[Richard Crunkilton]] by [[Ultimate Fighting Championship#Match outcome|unanimous decision]]. He went on to win his next UFC fight against [[Caol Uno]] (who narrowly missed the lightweight championship after drawing with [[B.J. Penn]]) at ''UFC 44'' before losing a majority decision to [[Josh Thomson]] at ''UFC 46''.

His next outing in the UFC, against [[Yves Edwards]], was unsuccessful, losing the fight by split decision. Edwards would once again beat Fran<U+00E7>a by split decision in their encounter at ''Euphoria: USA vs. World'' in 2005, starting what would be a very bad year&nbsp;<U+2013> marked with three straight losses&nbsp;<U+2013> for the Brazilian fighter.

===Post-UFC release===
However, 2006 would prove to be a much better year for Fran<U+00E7>a. In March, he toppled [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]] champion [[Gabe Ruediger]] to capture the WEC Lightweight championship and then knocked out [[Team Quest]] fighter [[Ryan Schultz]] to take the AFC Lightweight championship in April.

Fran<U+00E7>a would continue his winning streak against the likes of [[Toby Imada]] and [[Brandon Olsen]] before signing a contract to fight [[Roger Huerta]] at ''[[UFC 61]]'' in July. Although Fran<U+00E7>a's opponent was changed&nbsp;<U+2013> Huerta pulled out due to injury, with UFC newcomer [[Joe Jordan (fighter)|Joe Jordan]] taking his place&nbsp;<U+2013> Fran<U+00E7>a still reigned successful in his UFC return, stopping Jordan by [[triangle choke]] submission in the third round.

===Second UFC run===
On August 4, 2006, it was revealed that Fran<U+00E7>a had accepted a late-notice fight with [[Jamie Varner]] at ''[[UFC 62]]''. Fran<U+00E7>a came in as a late replacement for [[Spencer Fisher]], who injured his back while preparing for the fight.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news.asp?n_id=5212 |title=UFC 62: Fisher Out, Franca In |last=Savage |first=Greg |date=2006-08-04 |work=sherdog.com |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> Despite accepting the fight on short notice, Fran<U+00E7>a reigned victorious, catching Varner in an armbar submission in the third round.

Fran<U+00E7>a successfully defended his WEC Lightweight championship against [[Nathan Diaz]], brother of UFC veteran [[Nick Diaz]], at ''[[WEC 24]]'' on October 12, extending Fran<U+00E7>a's win streak in 2006 to seven consecutive victories.

Fran<U+00E7>a won his fight against [[Spencer Fisher]] at [[UFC Fight Night 8]] by TKO in the second round; after his victory he got down on his knees (<U+00E0> la [[Georges St. Pierre]]) and begged UFC President [[Dana White]] to grant him a title shot against [[Sean Sherk]]. During the post-fight press conference White confirmed that Fran<U+00E7>a would be given a title shot at ''[[UFC 73]]''.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Fran<U+00E7>a lost to [[Sean Sherk]] by unanimous decision. On July 19, 2007 the California State Athletic Commission announced Fran<U+00E7>a had tested positive for the banned steroid [[Drostanolone]] in a post-fight drug test following his championship fight at [[UFC 73]]. He had been suspended from competing in [[California]] until July 5, 2008 and had been fined $2,500.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ufcdaily.com/2007/07/19/sean-sherk-hermes-franca-test-positive-for-steroids|title=Sean Sherk, Hermes Fran<U+00E7>a Test Positive for Steroids|publisher=UFC Daily}}</ref>

He has since left The Armory and was then removed from their main site as an instructor.

Franca spent early January 2008 helping BJ Penn train for his 5-round fight against [[Joe Stevenson]] for the vacant UFC lightweight championship at [[UFC 80]].<ref name=helpingbj>{{cite web

Fran<U+00E7>a lost his first fight in the UFC since his suspension in 2007 on July 19, 2008 to [[Frankie Edgar]] via unanimous decision.

He then went on to defeat [[Marcus Aur<U+00E9>lio]] via unanimous decision at [[UFC 90]] on October 25, 2008.

Fran<U+00E7>a was scheduled to fight [[Joe Lauzon]] on February 7 in the main event for [[UFC Fight Night 17]].<ref>http://fightticker.com/story_0127091105_hermes_franca_injured_out_of_ufc_fight_night_bout_with_joe_lauzon</ref> However, Fran<U+00E7>a pulled out of the event with a torn anterior crucial ligament in his right knee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/13834/injury-forces-hermes-franca-off-ufc-fight-night-17-card.mma|title=Injury forces Hermes Fran<U+00E7>a off UFC Fight Night 17 card|publisher=MMAJunkie}}</ref>  Fran<U+00E7>a made his return against [[Tyson Griffin]] on September 19, 2009 at [[UFC 103]]. Franca lost his fight to Tyson Griffin in the second round via TKO (Punches) after Griffin caught him with a straight right followed up by brutal ground and pound, eventually knocking out Fran<U+00E7>a for only his second ever KO loss.

After his defeat at the hands of [[Tyson Griffin]] at [[UFC 103]], Fran<U+00E7>a was released by the organization, along with other UFC veterans, [[Chris Wilson (fighter)|Chris Wilson]], [[Marcus Aur<U+00E9>lio]] and [[Justin McCully]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2009/10/4/1069024/the-latest-4-ufc-fighters-to-be.mma/ |title= The latest 4 UFC fighters to be released

===Post-second UFC release===
Following the loss to Eric Wisely and losing 4 out of his last 5 fights, Franca announced through his manager, Reed Wallace, his retirement.<ref>http://mmaweekly.com/former-wec-champ-hermes-franca-calls-it-quits</ref>

Franca has since come out of retirement and has bounced back nicely after an 0-3-1 record in four fights during 2010. Franca won via submission in February 2011 then scored two wins in April 2011 defeating Robert Washington and Josh Thorpe.

===Xtreme Vale Todo 5 controversy===
At the Xtreme Vale Todo 5 event that took place in Costa Rica on December 19, 2010, Hermes Franca was awarded a judges decision over [[Ferrid Kheder]] before the promoter, [[Lu Dwyer]], attempted to overturn it, causing widespread controversy. In addition to the fight's announcer, all three judges and the referee had scored the bout in favor of Franca. Regardless of the actual scores, Lu Dwyer declared Kheder the victor, and another promoter raised Kheder's hand in victory after the referee refused to do so.<ref name="xtremevaletodo">{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/288316/Hermes-Franca-speaks-out-about-Xtreme-Vale-Todo-fiasco/ |title=Hermes Franca speaks out about Xtreme Vale Todo fiasco |publisher=mixedmartialarts.com |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref>

There is a potential conflict of interest due to the fact that Kheder is primarily sponsored by Dwyer and her business J & L Irrigation. Dwyer sponsors "Team FK" by paying his living expenses and taking a percentage of his winnings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/12/21/1890232/hermes-franca-falls-victim-to-unregulated-international-mma#storyjump|title=Updated: Hermes Franca Falls Victim to Unregulated International MMA, Result Appears to Have Been Overturned|author=Brent Brookhouse|publisher=Bloody Elbow}}</ref>

Days after his controversial decision win, Ferrid Kheder posted on his Facebook page that Dwyer decided to overturn the fight result to a "No Contest" and suggested a 5 round rematch, presumably in the same promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://middleeasy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3521:breaking-hermes-franca-vs-ferrid-kheder-ruled-a-no-contest&catid=35:events|title=Franca vs. Ferrid Kheder ruled a no-contest|publisher=MiddleEasy}}</ref>

===Arrest, MFC Termination, and Prison Sentence===
Franca appeared to be back on track, winning at MFC 29 and being slotted in to fight [[Drew Fickett]] for the promotion's vacant lightweight championship at MFC 30 on June 10, 2011. Franca, however, turned himself in to Clackamas County Sheriff's officials in mid-May, 2011 and was charged with multiple sexual battery charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/hermes-franca-arrested-on-multiple-counts-of-sexual-abuse-mfc-bout-in-doubt |title=Hermes Franca Arrested on Multiple Counts of Sexual Abuse; MFC Fires Him |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=2010-05-19}}</ref> MFC president Mark Pavelich then terminated Franca's contract on May 19, 2011, citing the arrest and Franca having fought two times outside of the organization, breaching his contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/mfc-officials-fire-hermes-franca-citing-arrest-and-breach-of-contract |title=MFC Officials Fire Hermes Franca Citing Arrest and Breach of Contract |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=2010-05-19}}</ref>

Franca pleaded guilty to one count of attempted unlawful penetration  and was sentenced to 42 months in [[state prison]]; he was also sentenced to 4 and a half years probation after he serves his prison sentence and must register as a sex offender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/26857/ufc-vet-hermes-franca-sentenced-to-42-months-in-prison.mma|title=UFC vet Hermes Franca sentenced to 42 months in prison|publisher=MMAjunkie.com|date=January 6, 2012}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Franca and his wife have one son.<ref name="ufc.com">[http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=6660 Article detailing his upcoming fight with Sean Sherk at UFC 73]</ref> Franca lost his father when he was 14.
