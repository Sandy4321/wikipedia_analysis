However, after a few spins it becomes clear that this is far from a flop".<ref name="DigitalSpyReview"/> Sarah-Louise James from the UK ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' lauded the musical style of "Not Myself Tonight" but opined that it was overshadowed by the accompanying S&M-inspired music video.<ref name="DailyStar"/> On a negative side, Mesfin Fekadu from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' mockingly described the single as "mediocre at best."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/06/07/review_aguilera_has_an_identity_crisis_on_new_cd/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+CD+reviews|title=Review: Aguilera has an identity crisis on new CD|first=Mesfin|last= Fedaku|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref>
