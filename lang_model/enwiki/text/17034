The practice of '''[[Christianity]] in [[Korea]]''' centres around two of its largest branches, [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]], accounting for 8.6 million and 5.1 million members respectively.<ref>[http://www.kosis.kr/OLAPN/Analysis/stat_OLAP.jsp?tbl_id=DT_1IN0505&org_id=101&vwcd=MT_ZTITLE&path=%C1%D6%C1%A6%BA%B0%20%3E%20%C0%CE%B1%B8%A1%A4%B0%A1%B1%B8%20%3E%20%C0%CE%B1%B8%C3%D1%C1%B6%BB%E7%20%3E%20%C0%CE%B1%B8%BA%CE%B9%AE%20%3E%20%C3%D1%C1%B6%BB%E7%C0%CE%B1%B8(2005)%20%3E%20%C0%FC%BC%F6%BA%CE%B9%AE&item=&keyword=&lang_mode=kor&list_id=A11I1&olapYN=]</ref> 

==History==
Christianity has had a short history in Korea, with Roman Catholicism first introduced during the late [[Joseon Dynasty]] period. In 1603, [[Yi Gwang-jeong]], Korean diplomat, returned from [[Beijing]] carrying a world [[atlas]] and several [[theology|theological]] books written by [[Matteo Ricci]], a Jesuit missionary to [[China]].{{Ref|early2}} He began disseminating the information in his books and from these beginnings the first real seeds of Christianity were sown. Christianity as a belief system did not expand much over the following two centuries.

The Roman Catholicism first introduced in 1785 by [[Yi Sung-hun]]. Even after this time, Korean Christians were subject to persecution and hardship but this has not put off believers. <ref>[http://bgc.gospelcom.net/emis/2005/persecution.html Evangelical Missions Quarterly <U+2013> Persecution: A Biblical and Personal Reflection]</ref> Many were [[martyr]]ed, the most famous of whom was [[Andrew Kim Taegon]], who was beheaded in 1846 at the age of 25 for his practice of a foreign religion.

The [[Joseon Dynasty]] saw the new religion as a subversive influence and persecuted its earliest followers in Korea, culminating in the Byeong-in Persecution of 1864, in which 8,000 Catholics across the country were killed, including nine French missionaries. The opening of Korea to the outside world in the following years brought religious toleration for the remaining Catholics and also introduced Protestantism. 

The growth of both was gradual, however, until the middle of the twentieth century, when a number of factors have encouraged the growth of Christianity in Korea, and its growth since the 1960s has been significant enough that the number of adherents to Christianity surpassed that of adherents to the traditional religions. Today, Protestantism and [[Roman Catholicism in South Korea]] face different challenges, with the Korean Protestantism mired in various controversies and struggling with a declining number of followers,<ref>[http://www.omf.org/omf/us/peoples_and_places/countries/south_korea/south_korea_cont Number of Christians among young Koreans decreases by 5% per year] {{dead link | date= June 2010}}</ref> while the Catholic Church in Korea has increased its membership by 70% in the last ten years.<ref> [http://www.kosis.kr/OLAPN/Analysis/stat_OLAP.jsp?tbl_id=DT_1IN0505&org_id=101&vwcd=MT_ZTITLE&path=%C1%D6%C1%A6%BA%B0%20%3E%20%C0%CE%B1%B8%A1%A4%B0%A1%B1%B8%20%3E%20%C0%CE%B1%B8%C3%D1%C1%B6%BB%E7%20%3E%20%C0%CE%B1%B8%BA%CE%B9%AE%20%3E%20%C3%D1%C1%B6%BB%E7%C0%CE%B1%B8(2005)%20%3E%20%C0%FC%BC%F6%BA%CE%B9%AE&item=&keyword=&lang_mode=kor&list_id=A11I1&olapYN=] </ref><ref> [http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=262&aid=0000000521]</ref>

==Size and cultural significance==
Prior to the [[Korean War]] (1950<U+2013>1953), two-thirds of Korean Christians lived in the North, but most later fled to the South.{{Ref|intro1}} It is not known exactly how many Christians remain in [[North Korea]] today, and there is some confusion about the exact number in [[South Korea]] as well. It is known that by the end of the 1960s there were barely one million Protestants in South Korea, but during the "Conversion Boom" period ending in the 1980s, the number of Protestants increased faster than in any other country.

The 2005 South Korean census showed 29.2 percent of the population as Christian, up from 26.3 percent ten years previously.<ref>[http://kostat.go.kr/eboard_faq/BoardAction.do?method=view&board_id=106&seq=120&num=120 figures from the 2005 census] [http://kostat.go.kr/eboard_civil/BoardAction.do?method=view&board_id=111&seq=1752&num=1752 Figures from the 1995 census]</ref> 

Surveys have shown that South Korean Christians are very active, quite often exceeding their American counterparts in frequency of attendance at group worship services.<ref>[http://www.zogbyworldwide.com/int/readnewswire.cfm?ID=724 Error Occurred While Processing Request<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Seoul]] contains eleven of the world's twelve largest Christian congregations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} South Korea also provides the world's second largest number of Christian [[missionary|missionaries]], surpassed only by the [[United States]]. South Korean missionaries are especially prevalent in [[10/40 Window]] nations that are hostile to Westerners. In 2000, there were 10,646 Protestant South Korean missionaries in 156 countries, along with an undisclosed number of Catholic missionaries. A number of South Korean Christians, including [[David Yonggi Cho]], senior pastor of [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]], have attained worldwide prominence.  [[Rev. Abraham Park Yoon-Sik]], Senior Pastor of the [[Pyungkang Cheil Presbyterian Church]] (one of the largest Christian churches in South Korea), is the author of the History of Redemption Series of books which have gathered strong praise from theologians worldwide.  He is also the co-founder of [[the Abraham Park Kenneth Vine Collection]] biblical museum in Seoul.

==Factors encouraging the growth of Christianity==
{{undue|date=May 2010}}

===Academic sympathy===
[[Matteo Ricci]]'s books provoked immediate [[academia|academic]] controversy when Yi Gwang-jeong brought them into Korea, and academics remained critical for many years. Early in the seventeenth century, [[Yi Su-gwang]], a court scholar, and Yu Mong-in, a cabinet minister, wrote highly critical [[literary criticism|commentaries]] on Ricci's works, and over the next two centuries academic criticism of Christian beliefs continued unabated.

Some scholars, however, were more sympathetic to Christianity. Members of the [[Silhak]] (<U+C2E4><U+D559>; "practical learning") school believed in social structure based on merit rather than birth (see [[classism]]), and were therefore often opposed by the mainstream academic establishment. Silhak scholars saw Christianity as an [[ideology|ideological]] basis for their beliefs and were therefore attracted to what they saw as the [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] values of Christianity.{{Ref|academic1}} Thus, when Christianity was finally established in Korea, there was already a substantial body of educated opinion sympathetic to it, which was crucial to the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.{{Ref|academic2}} An 1801 study indicated that 55% of all Catholics had family ties to the Silhak school.{{Ref|academic3}} This [[philosophy|philosophical]] sympathy for Christianity among the educated [[elite]] greatly helped its growth in Korea.

===Lay leadership===
Largely as a result of the influence of the Silhak school, Christianity in Korea began as an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[laity|lay]] movement rather than being imposed by a foreign [[ecclesiastical]] [[hierarchy]]. The first Catholic prayer-house was founded in 1784 at [[Pyongyang]] by [[Yi Sung-hun]], a [[diplomat]] who had been [[baptism|baptized]] in [[Beijing]].{{Ref|lay1}} In 1786, Yi proceeded to establish a hierarchy of lay-priests.{{Ref|lay2}} Although the Vatican ruled in 1789 that the appointment of lay-priests violated [[Canon Law]], Christianity was introduced into Korea by indigenous lay-workers, not by foreign [[prelate]]s. Since Christianity began as largely a "grass-roots" effort in Korea, it spread more quickly through the population than it would if it had originated with outsiders with no initial popular support.

===Hangul, literacy, and education===
[[Hangul]], a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] Korean [[alphabet]] invented around 1446 by scholars in the court of [[King Sejong]] ,{{Ref|education1}}{{Ref|education2}} was little used for several centuries because of the perceived cultural superiority of [[Classical Chinese]] (a position similar to that of [[Latin]] in Europe). However, the Catholic Church became the first Korean organization to officially recognize the value of using Hangul, and [[Simeon-Francois Berneux|Bishop Berneux]] mandated that all Catholic children be taught to read it.{{Ref|education1}}{{Ref|use1}}  Christian literature printed for use in Korea, including that used by the network of schools established by Christian missionaries, mostly used the Korean language and the easily-learned Hangul [[writing system|script]].  

This combination of factors not only resulted in a rise in the overall [[literacy]] rate, but also enabled Christian teachings to spread beyond the elite, who mostly used Chinese.  As early as the 1780s, portions of the [[Gospels]] appeared in Hangul; [[doctrine|doctrinal]] books such as the Jugyo Yoji (<U+C8FC><U+AD50><U+C694><U+C9C0>) appeared in the 1790s and a Catholic [[hymnary]] was printed around 1800.

[[John Ross (missionary)|John Ross]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] Presbyterian missionary in [[Manchuria]] completed his translation of the [[Bible]] into Korean in 1887 <ref>[http://digilib.bu.edu/mission/component/content/article/20-p2r/107-ross-john-1842-1915.html John Ross (1842-1915), Scottish Presbyterian Missionary in Manchuria]</ref> and Protestant leaders immediately began a mass-circulation effort. In addition, they established the first modern educational institutions in Korea.{{Ref|protestantism2}}  The Methodist [[Pai Chai University|Paichai School]] for boys was founded in 1885, and the Methodist Ewha School for girls (later to become [[Ewha Womans University]]) followed in 1886. These, and similar schools established soon afterwards, helped the rapid expansion of Protestantism among the common people, and in time Protestants surpassed Catholics as the largest Christian group in Korea.  As a side effect during this period, female literacy rose sharply, since women had previously been excluded from the educational system.{{Ref|education3}}

===Parallels in Korean tradition===
The spread of Christianity in Korea was aided by the similarity of certain Christian doctrines with a number of Korean [[tradition]]s.  Unlike prevailing Chinese and Japanese religions of the time, shamanist Koreans had an [[monotheism|monotheistic]] concept of a Creator-God,{{Ref|parallel1}} whom they called [[Hwanin|Hwan-in]] or Hanal-nim (<U+D558><U+B0A0><U+B2D8>) (later also Haneul-nim, <U+D558><U+B298><U+B2D8>/<U+D558><U+B290><U+B2D8>, or Hana-nim, <U+D558><U+B098><U+B2D8>).  According to an ancient [[myth]], Hwan-in had a son named [[Hwanung]] (<U+D658><U+C6C5>) who, in turn, had fathered a human son named [[Dangun]] in 2333 BC.{{Ref|parallel2}}{{Ref|parallel3}}{{Ref|parallel4}} According to the story, Dangun founded the first Korean state and taught his people the elements of civilization during his thousand-year reign.{{Ref|parallel5}}  There are several variants of this myth, one of which depicts Dangun as having been mothered by a [[virgin]]{{Ref|parallel6}}. Some modern theologians have even attempted to explain the Christian concept of the [[Trinity]] in terms of the three divine characters in the Dangun myth.{{Ref|parallel7}} These parallels eased the Korean people's understanding of various Christian teachings, such as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of [[Jesus]].

===Identification with Korean nationalism===
One of the most important factors leading to widespread acceptance of Christianity in Korea was the identification that many Christians forged with the cause of [[Korean nationalism]] during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] of 1905 through 1945.

During this period, seven million Koreans were [[exile]]d or [[deportation|deported]]{{Ref|identification1}} and a systematic campaign of [[cultural assimilation]] was attempted. In 1938, even use of the Korean language was prohibited.{{Ref|identification2}} However, the distinctly Korean nature of the church was reinforced during those years by the allegiance to the nation that was demonstrated by many Christians.  Furthermore, while the subsequent [[constitution]] of South Korea guarantees [[freedom of religion]] as well as [[separation of church and state]], the [[South Korean government]] has been favorable overall to Christianity, regarding the religion as an ideological protection against [[Communism]].

On March 1, 1919, an assembly of thirty-three religious and professional leaders known as the "[[March 1 Movement]]" passed a [[Declaration of Independence]]. Although organized by leaders of the [[Chondogyo]] religion, fifteen of the thirty-three signatories happened to be Protestants{{Ref|identification3}}, and many of them were imprisoned. Also in 1919, the predominantly Catholic pro-independence movement called "Ulmindan" {{Ref|identification4}} was founded, and a [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|China-based government-in-exile]] was at one time led by [[Syngman Rhee]], a Methodist.{{Ref|identification5}}

Christianity was linked even more with the patriotic cause when Christians refused to participate in [[emperor worship|worship]] of the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]], which was required by law in the 1930s.{{Ref|identification6}}{{Ref|identification7}} Although this particular refusal was motivated by theological rather than political convictions, the consequent imprisonment of many Christians strongly identified their faith, in the eyes of many Koreans, with the cause of Korean nationalism and resistance to the Japanese occupation.  This show of resistance to the occupying nation enabled Koreans to see past the foreign origins of Christianity and accept it as their own.

===Minjung theology===
{{Main|Minjung theology}}

The Christian concept of individual worth has also found expression in a lengthy struggle for human rights and democracy in Korea. In recent years, this struggle has taken the form of [[Minjung theology]]. Minjung theology is based on the "image of God" concept expressed in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201:26-27&version=31 Genesis 1:26-27], but also incorporates the traditional Korean feeling of ''[[Han (cultural)|han]]'', a word that has no exact English translation, but that denotes a sense of inconsolable pain and utter helplessness.  Minjung theology depicts commoners in Korean history as the rightful masters of their own destiny.  Two of the country's best known political leaders, [[Kim Young-sam]], a Presbyterian, and [[Kim Dae-jung]], a Roman Catholic, subscribe to Minjung theology.{{Ref|minjung1}}  Both men spent decades opposing military governments in South Korea and were frequently imprisoned as a result, and both also served terms as President of the Republic after democracy was restored in 1988.

One manifestation of Minjung theology in the final years of the [[Park Chung-hee]] regime (1961-1979) was the rise of several Christian social missions, such as the [[Catholic Farmers Movement]] and the Protestant [[Urban Industrial Mission]], which campaigned for better wages and working conditions for laborers.  The military government imprisoned many of their leaders because it considered the movement a threat to social stability, and their struggle coincided with a period of popular unrest which culminated in the [[assassination]] of President Park on October 26, 1979,{{Ref|minjung2}}. However, even this period of turmoil affected the growth of Christianity to the degree that Koreans saw it as a source of stability in a difficult time.

===Social change===
Many Korean Christians believe that their values have had a positive effect on various social relationships. Traditional Korean society was hierarchically arranged according to Confucian principles under the semi-divine emperor. Women had no social rights,{{Ref|social1}} children were totally subservient to their parents,{{Ref|social2}} and individuals had no rights except as defined by the overall social system.  This structure was challenged by the Christian teaching that all men are created in the image of God and thus that every individual has essential worth. Closely aligned to this concept is an emphasis on the right to own private property.{{Ref|social3}}

Christians regarded the emperor as a mere man who was as much under God's authority as were his subjects,{{Ref|social4}} and Christian values also favored the social emancipation of women and children.{{Ref|social5}}{{Ref|social6}}  The church permitted the remarriage of widows (as taught by apostle Paul, not traditionally allowed in East Asian societies{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}), prohibited concubinage and polygamy, and forbade cruelty to or desertion of wives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required to educate them.{{Ref|social7}} Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in Asian culture) were prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} These changes were judged as favourable by many Koreans, who associated them with Christianity, and many became Christians as a result.

===Economic success===
South Korea's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s is usually credited to the policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] led by [[Park Chung Hee|Park Chung-hee]] to indigenous cultural [[values]] and [[work ethic]], a strong alliance with the United States, and the infusion of foreign [[capital (economics)|capital]]. But many South Korean Christians view their religious faith as a factor in the country's dramatic economic growth over the past three decades, believing that its success and prosperity are indications of God's blessing.

A 2003 study by economists Robert J. Barro and Rachel McCleary suggests that societies with high levels of belief in heaven and low levels of church attendance also exhibit high rates of economic growth.<ref>[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/papers/Religion_and_Economic_Growth.pdf]</ref> Barro and McCleary's model has been influential in subsequent scholarship and, to some observers, it supports the belief that Christianity has played a major role in South Korea's economic success.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2004/02/01/2003097097]</ref><ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70913FE355C0C728FDDA80894DC404482]</ref> The study has also been criticised by scholars such as Durlauf, Kortellos, and Tan (2006), who argue on statistical grounds that there is little evidence connecting religion and economic growth either directly or indirectly.<ref>[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/econ/archive/wp2006-09.pdf]</ref>

The confidence of South Korean Christians in the social and economic benefits of their faith has been a factor in the spread of Christianity in South Korea. There is much appreciation in South Korea for the statistical growth, impressive organization, and attractive buildings of many Christian groups. Koreans quite naturally want to associate themselves with prosperity and success, and insofar as they see Christianity as the source of those things, they will be more likely to accept it as an important influence in their lives.
