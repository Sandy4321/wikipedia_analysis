'''''Night of the Living Dead''''' is a 1968 American [[independent film|independent]] [[black-and-white]] [[zombie film]] directed by [[George A. Romero]]. It premiered on October 1, 1968, and was completed on a [[United States dollar|USD]]$114,000 [[budget]]. After decades of cinematic re-releases, it grossed some $12 [[million]] [[Cinema of the United States|domestically]] and $30 [[million]] internationally. ''Night of the Living Dead'' was heavily criticized during its release because of its explicit content. However, it eventually received critical acclaim and was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as a film deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."<ref name="CNN"/>

The film follows Ben ([[Duane Jones]]), Barbra ([[Judith O'Dea]]), and five others, who are trapped in a [[rural]] farmhouse in [[Pennsylvania]] and attempt to survive the night while the house is being attacked by mysteriously [[Corporeal reanimation|reanimated]] ghouls, otherwise known as [[zombies]]. ''Night of the Living Dead'' is the origin of six other ''[[Living Dead]]'' films directed by George A. Romero and became the inspiration for two remakes of the film, [[Night of the Living Dead (1990 film)|film of the same name]] directed by [[Tom Savini]], and ''[[Night of the Living Dead 3D]]'', which was directed by [[Jeff Broadstreet]] and contained a much different storyline.

== Plot ==
Siblings Barbra ([[Judith O'Dea]]) and Johnny ([[Russell Streiner]]) drive to a rural [[Pennsylvania]] [[cemetery]] to visit their father's grave. Barbra is afraid of cemeteries; Johnny frightens her repeating, "They're coming to get you, Barbra!" A pale skinned man ([[Bill Hinzman]]) is walking with a limp around the cemetery, and Johnny says that he is "one of them." Annoyed by Johnny's ignorance, Barbra goes to the man to apologize, but he grabs her. Coming to save his sister, Johnny wrestles with the man but is killed when he falls headfirst on a tombstone. Barbra flees, being pursued by the man. Crashing her and Johnny's car into a tree, she goes to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse of the homeowner. As she runs out into the yard, she realizes several more ghoulish figures are swarming toward the house. Suddenly, a man named Ben ([[Duane Jones]]) arrives at the house, drags Barbra inside and boards up the doors and windows. Barbra frantically insists that they must go and rescue Johnny, then collapses in shock.

[[File:Zombies NightoftheLivingDead.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ghouls swarm around the house, searching for living human flesh.]]

Hiding in the cellar are an angry married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper ([[Karl Hardman]] and [[Marilyn Eastman]]), their daughter Karen ([[Kyra Schon]]), and teenage couple Tom and Judy ([[Keith Wayne]] and [[Judith Ridley]]). Ben activates a radio while Barbra awakens, believing Tom and Harry to be more of the ghouls when they emerge from the cellar. Arguing with each other, Harry wants everyone to hide in the cellar but Ben deems it a "death trap" and remains upstairs. Tom agrees with Ben and asks for Judy to come upstairs.

Harry returns to the cellar to Helen and Karen, who was bitten on the arm by one of the attackers and has fallen ill. Radio reports explain that an epidemic of mass murder is sweeping across the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]]. Ben discovers a television; the emergency broadcaster horrifyingly reveals that the recently deceased have reanimated and are consuming the flesh of living humans. Experts, scientists, and the military do not know the cause; one scientist believes it is caused by [[radioactive contamination]] from a space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere. 

[[File:CooperFamily.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Cooper family have been hiding in the cellar beneath the house.]]

After the news reports reveal a series of local fortifications that the living are to retreat to for safety from the living dead, Ben devises a plan to escape from the house and head to the nearest one, for protection and to get medical help for Karen, who is barely conscious. Ben suggests they escape using the truck he drove to the house, but it needs fuel. Ben and Tom drive the short distance to an outside gas pump while Harry hurls [[Molotov cocktail]]s from an upper window to restrain the ghouls. Judy fears for Tom's safety and runs after him. They arrive at the pump but Tom spills fuel, setting the truck alight. Tom and Judy drive the truck from the pump to avoid further damage but it explodes, killing them. Ben returns to the house to find Harry boarding up the front door, which would leave Ben stranded outside at the mercy of the ghouls. Very angry with his actions, Ben kicks the door down and furiously beats Harry. Ghouls approach the truck and feed on Tom and Judy's flesh.  Back in the house, a final report on the television reveals that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop the [[ghouls in popular culture|"ghouls"]] and that [[posse comitatus (common law)|posses]] of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.

After the ghouls attempt to break into the house, Harry spots Ben's rifle and threatens to shoot him. Ben wrestles the gun from Harry and shoots him. The ghouls begin to tug Helen and Barbra through the windows. Harry stumbles into the cellar to find Karen has died from the infected bite on her arm, and Harry dies. Helen frees herself of the ghouls and proceeds to the cellar to find Karen reanimated and consuming Harry's flesh. Karen repeatedly stabs Helen with a cement trowel, killing her.

Barbra spots Johnny in the group of ghouls; distracted, she is carried away and never seen again. Karen tries to attack Ben, but he pushes her away and seals himself in the cellar, ironically the course of action he originally argued against. Ben shoots the reanimated Harry and Helen. He is the only one to survive the night, and awakens when a posse arrives. He hears the posse and proceeds to the window, when a member of the posse mistakes him for a ghoul and shoots him, killing him. His body is then placed onto a burning [[pyre]] with other dead ghouls.

== Production ==
=== Development and background ===
While attending [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Romero embarked upon his career in the [[film industry]]. In the 1960s, he directed and produced television commercials and [[sponsored film|industrial films]] for The Latent Image, a company he co-founded with friends [[John Russo]] and Russell Streiner. During this period, the trio grew bored making commercials and wanted to film a horror movie. According to Romero, they wanted to capitalize on the film industry's "thirst for the bizarre".<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead]. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref> He and Streiner contacted Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, president and vice president respectively of a Pittsburgh-based industrial film firm called Hardman Associates, Inc., and pitched their idea for a then-untitled horror film.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> Convinced by Romero, a production company called Image Ten was formed which included Romero, Russo, Streiner, Hardman and Eastman. The initial budget was $6,000 with the ten members of the production company investing $600 each for a share of the profits. When it was found that another $6,000 was required another ten investors were found but this was also soon found to be inadequate. Image Ten eventually raised approximately $114,000 for the budget.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview"/><ref name="RomeroPreface">George A.

=== Principal photography ===
[[File:EvansCityCemetery PA.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Evans City, Pennsylvania|Evans City]] Cemetery in 2007.]]
The small budget dictated much of the production process. According to Hardman, "We knew that we could not raise enough money to shoot a film on a par with the classic horror films with which we had all grown up. The best that we could do was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot".<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview"/> Scenes were filmed near [[Evans City, Pennsylvania]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of Pittsburgh in rural [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler County]]; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. The indoor scenes (upstairs) were filmed in a downtown Evans City home that later became the offices of a prominent local physician and family doctor (Allsop). This home is still standing on South Washington St. (locally called [[Pennsylvania Route 855|Mars-Evans City Road]]), between the intersecting streets of South Jackson and Van Buren.

The outdoor, indoor (downstairs) and basement scenes were filmed at a location northeast of Evans City, near a park. The basement door (external view) shown in the film was cut into a wall by the production team and led nowhere. As this house was scheduled for demolition, damage during filming was permitted. The site is now a [[Sod|turf farm]].<ref>What park? And where was the house, exactly? And yes, we DO need to know.</ref><ref>Neil Fawcett, "Evans Cemetery: Then and Now" at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/baps/evans_cemetary.html Homepage of the Dead].

[[Theatrical property|Props]] and [[special effect]]s were fairly simple and limited by the budget. The blood, for example, was [[Bosco Chocolate Syrup]] drizzled over cast members' bodies.<ref>"The Filming" of ''Night of the Living Dead'' at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/filming.html Homepage of the Dead]. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref> Consumed flesh was roasted ham and entrails donated by one of the actors who also owned a chain of butchers shops. Costumes consisted of second-hand clothing from cast members and [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]]. Zombie makeup varied during the film. Initially makeup was limited to "Raccoon" faces, white skin with blackened eyes, but as filming progressed mortician's wax was used to simulate wounds and decay to make the zombies more frightening. As filming was not linear, the "Raccoon" faces appear sporadically. Eastman supervised the special effects, wardrobe and makeup.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview"/> Filming took place between June and December 1967 under the working title ''Night of Anubis'' and later ''Night of the Flesh Eaters''.<ref name="IMDbbusiness">Business data for the film at the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/business Internet Movie Database]; last accessed June 24, 2006; however, places the box-office gross of $12 million at January 2000, not 1979.</ref><ref name="Scrapbook, Special Features 2002">Scrapbook, Special Features, ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition (DVD, Elite Entertainment, 2002).</ref><ref name="FrightfulFacts">"Frightful Facts" at [http://www.houseofhorrors.com/night68.htm House of Horrors]. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref> The small budget led Romero to shoot on [[35 mm|35&nbsp;mm]] black-and-white film. The completed film ultimately benefited from the decision, as film historian Joseph Maddrey describes the black-and-white filming as "[[guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla-style]]", resembling "the unflinching authority of a wartime [[newsreel]]". Maddrey adds, it "seem[s] as much like a documentary on the loss of social stability as an [[exploitation film]]".<ref>Joseph Maddrey, ''Nightmares in Red, White and Blue: The Evolution of the American Horror Film'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 51, ISBN 978-0-7864-1860-2 .</ref>

=== Post-production ===
Members of Image Ten were involved in filming and [[Film editing|post-production]], participating in loading [[camera magazine]]s, [[gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffing]], constructing props, recording sounds and editing.<ref name="RomeroPreface"/> Production stills were shot and printed by Karl Hardman, who stated in an interview that a "number of cast members formed a production line in the darkroom for developing, washing and drying of the prints as I made the exposures. As I recall, I shot over 1,250 pictures during the production".<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview"/> Upon completion of post-production, Image Ten found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] and [[American International Pictures]] declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot the final scene were rejected by producers.<ref>Jason Paul Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's: Interviews with 20 Cult Film Actresses'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 4, ISBN 978-0-7864-1818-3.</ref> Romero admitted that "none of us wanted to do that.

Romero Bio", Special Features, ''Dawn of the Dead'', Special Divimax Edition (DVD, Anchor Bay, 2004), [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001611DI/ ASIN B0001611DI].</ref>  The [[Manhattan]]-based [[Walter Reade|Walter Reade Organization]] agreed to show the film uncensored, but changed the title from ''Night of the Flesh Eaters'' to ''Night of the Living Dead'' because a film had already been produced under a [[The Flesh Eaters (film)|similar title]] to the former.<ref name="FrightfulFacts"/>  While changing the title, the copyright notice was accidentally deleted from the early releases of the film.

=== Writing ===
Co-written as a [[horror comedy]] by John Russo and George A. Romero under the title ''Monster Flick'',<ref name="Scrapbook, Special Features 2002"/> an early screenplay draft concerned the exploits of teenage [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] who visit [[Earth]] and befriend human teenagers. A second version of the script featured a young man who runs away from home and discovers rotting human corpses that aliens use for food scattered across a meadow. The final draft, written mainly by Romero during three days in 1967, focused on reanimated human corpses <U+2014> Romero refers to them as ''[[ghouls]]'' <U+2014> that feast on the flesh of the living.<ref name="Treatment">John A.

Part one became ''Night of the Living Dead''. Sequels ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978) and ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' (1985) were adapted from the two remaining parts.<ref>George A. Romero interview, ''Forbidden Weekend'', February 2, 1997, available here [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/baps/bbc_interview.html]. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref>

Romero drew inspiration from [[Richard Matheson]]'s ''[[I Am Legend (book)|I Am Legend]]'' (1954), a [[horror fiction|horror/science fiction novel]] about a [[Epidemic|plague]] that ravages a futuristic [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

{{cquote|I thought ''I Am Legend'' was about revolution. I said if you<U+2019>re going to do something about revolution, you should start at the beginning. I mean, Richard starts his book with one man left; everybody in the world has become a vampire. I said we got to start at the beginning and tweak it up a little bit. I couldn<U+2019>t use vampires because he did, so I wanted something that would be an earth-shaking change. Something that was forever, something that was really at the heart of it. I said, so what if the dead stop staying dead? ... And the stories are about how people respond or fail to respond to this. That<U+2019>s really all [the zombies] ever represented to me.

Official [[film adaptation]]s of Matheson's novel appeared in 1964 as ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', in 1971 as ''[[The Omega Man]]'', and the 2007 release ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''. Matheson was not impressed by Romero's interpretation, feeling that "It was ... kind of cornball",<ref>Richard Matheson interview, in Tom Weaver, ''Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1999), p. 307, ISBN 978-0-7864-0755-2.</ref> though he later said, "George Romero's a nice guy, though.

Russo and Romero revised the screenplay while filming. Karl Hardman attributed the edits to lead actor Duane Jones:
{{cquote|The script had been written with the character Ben as a rather simple truck driver. His dialogue was that of a lower class / uneducated person. Duane Jones was a very well educated man [and he] simply refused to do the role as it was written. As I recall, I believe that Duane himself upgraded his own dialogue to reflect how he felt the character should present himself.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview"/>}}

Eastman modified cellar scenes featuring dialogue between Helen and Harry Cooper.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview"/> According to lead actress Judith O'Dea, much of the dialogue was [[Improvisational theatre|improvised]]. She told an interviewer, "I don't know if there was an actual working script! We would go over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each felt it ''should'' be done".<ref name="O'Deainterview">Judith O'Dea interview, in Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 4.</ref> One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnny's death:

{{cquote|The sequence where Ben is breaking up the table to block the entrance and I'm on the couch and start telling him the story of what happened [to Johnny] it's all [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]].

[[File:Duane Jones as Ben in Night of the Living Dead bw.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ben, played by [[Duane Jones]].]]

The lead role of Ben was played by unknown stage actor Duane Jones. His performance depicted Ben as a "comparatively calm and resourceful [[Negro]]", according to a contemporary (1969) movie reviewer.<ref>Kevin Thomas, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Los Angeles ''Times'', January 10, 1969, reprinted in ''The A-List: The National Society of Film Critics' 100 Essential Films'', ed. Jay Carr (Cambridge, Mass.: Da Capo Press, 2002), p. 199, ISBN 978-0-306-81096-1 .</ref> Casting Jones as the hero was, in 1968, potentially controversial. At that time, it was not typical for an African American man to be the hero of a film when the rest of the cast was composed entirely of white actors and actresses. Social commentators saw that casting as significant; on the other hand, Romero said that Jones "simply gave the best audition".<ref name="RomeroJones">George A. Romero, quoted in Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror Movies'', p. 118.</ref> After ''Night of the Living Dead'', he co-starred in ''[[Ganja and Hess]]'' (1973), ''[[Vampires (1986 film)|Vampires]]'' (1986), ''[[Negatives (film)|Negatives]]'' (1988) and ''[[To Die For (1989 film)|To Die For]]'' (1989) before his death in 1988.<ref>Duane Jones at the [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427977/ Internet Movie Database].

Judith O'Dea, a 23-year-old commercial and stage actress, played Barbra. She had once worked for Hardman and Eastman in [[Pittsburgh]], so they called her to audition. O'Dea was in [[Hollywood]] seeking to enter the movie business. She remarked in an interview that starring in the film was a positive experience for her, although she admitted that horror movies terrified her, particularly [[Vincent Price|Vincent Price's]] ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' (1953). Besides acting, O'Dea performed her own stunts, which she jokingly says amounted to "lots of running". Assessing ''Night of the Living Dead'', she states "I honestly had no idea it would have such a lasting impact on our culture". She was just as surprised by the renown the film brought her: "People treat you differently. [I'm] [[wiktionary:ho-hum#English|ho-hum]] Judy O'Dea until they realize [I'm] Barbra from ''Night of the Living Dead''. All of a sudden [I'm] not so ho-hum anymore!"<ref name="O'Deainterview"/> Following ''Night of the Living Dead'', O'Dea appeared in the television film ''The Pirate'' in 1978 and feature films ''[[Claustrophobia (2004 film)|Claustrophobia]]'', ''[[October Moon]]'', and ''[[The Ocean (film)|The Ocean]]''.<ref>Judith O'Dea at the [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640621/ Internet Movie Database].

Retrieved June 24, 2006. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> Romero's decision to direct ''Night of the Living Dead'' essentially launched his career as a horror director. He took the helm of the sequels as well as ''Season of the Witch'', ''[[The Crazies (1973 film)|The Crazies]]'' (1973), ''[[Martin (film)|Martin]]'' (1977), ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993).<ref>George A. Romero biography at [http://www.horrordirectors.com/georgeromero.html HorrorDirectors.com]. Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref> Critics saw the influence of the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s in Romero's directorial style. Stephen Paul Miller, for instance, witnessed "a revival of fifties schlock shock... and the army general's television discussion of military operations in the film echoes the often inevitable calling-in of the army in fifties horror films". Miller admits, however, that "''Night of the Living Dead'' takes greater relish in mocking these military operations through the general's pompous demeanor" and the government's inability to source the zombie epidemic or protect the citizenry.<ref>Stephen Paul Miller, ''The Seventies Now: Culture as Surveillance'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1999), p. 81, ISBN 978-0-8223-2166-8 .</ref> Romero describes the mood he wished to establish: "The film opens with a situation that has already disintegrated to a point of little hope, and it moves progressively toward absolute despair and ultimate tragedy".<ref>George A. Romero, quoted in Royer, ''The Spectacle Of Isolation,'' p. 15.</ref> According to film historian Carl Royer, Romero "employs [[chiaroscuro]] ([[film noir]] style) lighting to emphasize humanity's nightmare alienation from itself".<ref>Carl Royer, ''The Spectacle Of Isolation In Horror Films: Dark Parades'' Binghamton, N.Y.: Haworth Press, 2005), p. 15, ISBN 978-0-7890-2264-6 .</ref>

While some critics dismissed Romero's film because of the graphic scenes, writer [[R. H. W. Dillard]] claimed that the "open-eyed detailing" of [[taboo]] heightened the film's success. He asks, "What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother? And Karen, in the film, offers a particularly vivid opportunity to commit the forbidden deed vicariously."<ref>R. H. W. Dillard, "''Night of the Living Dead'': It's Not Like Just a Wind That's Passing Through", in ''American Horrors: Essays on the Modern American Horror Film'', ed. Gregory A. Waller (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988), p. 15, ISBN 978-0-252-01448-2 .</ref> Romero featured social taboos as key themes, particularly [[cannibalism]]. Although zombie cannibals were inspired by Matheson's ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', film historian Robin Wood sees the flesh-eating scenes of ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a late-1960s critique of American [[capitalism]]. Wood asserts that the zombies represent capitalists, and "cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism." He argues that the zombies' victims symbolized the repression of "[[Other|the Other]]" in [[bourgeoisie]] American society, namely [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights activists]], [[Second-wave feminism|feminists]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[counterculture|counterculturalists]] in general.<ref>Robin Wood, "An Introduction to the American Horror Film", in ''Movies and Methods'', Vol. II, ed.

=== Music and sound effects ===
The [[film score|music score]] of ''Night of the Living Dead'' was not composed for the film; Karl Hardman told an interviewer that the music came from the extensive film music library of WRS Studio. Much of what was used in the film was purchased from the library of [[Capitol Records]], and an album of the soundtrack was released at one point. Stock music selections included works by WRS sound tech Richard Lococo, [[Philip Green (composer)|Philip Green]], [[Geordie Hormel]], [[Ib Glindemann]], William Loose, John Seely, Jack Meakin and Spencer Moore.

Some of the music in the film had previously been used on the soundtrack for the science-fiction [[B-movie]] ''[[Teenagers from Outer Space]]'' (1959). The eerie musical piece during the tense scene in the film where Ben finds the rifle in the closet inside the farmhouse as the radio reports of mayhem play in the background can be heard in longer and more complete form during the opening credits and the beginning of ''[[The Devil's Messenger]]'' (1961) starring [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] Another piece, accompanying Barbra's flight from the cemetery zombie, was taken from the score for ''[[The Hideous Sun Demon]]'' (1959) and had also been used in the final episode of television's ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which had aired one year earlier. According to WRS, "We chose a selection of music for each of the various scenes and then George made the final selections. We then took those selections and augmented them electronically". Sound tech R.Lococo's choices worked well, as Film historian Sumiko Higashi believes that the music "signifies the nature of events that await".<ref>Sumiko Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead'': A Horror Film about the Horrors of the Vietnam Era", in ''From Hanoi to Hollywood''</ref>

Sound effects were created by WRS Studio in Pittsburgh. "Sound engineer Richard Lococo recorded all of the live sound effects used in the film". Lococo recalled, "Of all the sound effects that we created, the one that still gives me goose bumps when I hear it, is Marilyn's screaming as [Helen Cooper] is killed by her daughter. Judy O'Dea's screaming is a close second. Both were looped in and out of echo over and over again". A [[soundtrack album]] featuring music and dialogue cues from the film was compiled and released by [[Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande]] in 1982; however, it has never been reissued on [[compact disc|CD]]. In November 2008, recording group 400 Lonely Things released the album ''Tonight of the Living Dead'', "an instrumental album composed entirely of ambient music and sound effects sampled from Romero's 1968 horror classic".<ref>Paul Corupe, "They're Coming to Remix You, Barbra", ''Rue Morgue'' (No. 92, August 2009), p. 63</ref>
On 25 May 2010, the record company Zero Day Releasing released the CD ''They Won't Stay Dead!: Music from the soundtrack of Night of the Living Dead''. It features all-new digitally restored audio from original library LPs and reels and it's the most comprehensive ''Night of the Living Dead'' soundtrack ever released in any format. It contains much more music than the Varese release, having 40 tracks.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film. "I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them," he said. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:
{{cquote|The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying... It's hard to remember what sort of effect this movie might have had on you when you were six or seven. But try to remember. At that age, kids take the events on the screen seriously, and they identify fiercely with the hero. When the hero is killed, that's not an unhappy ending but a [[tragedy|tragic]] one: Nobody got out alive. It's just over, that's all.

=== Reviews ===
Reviewers disliked the film's gory special effects. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' labeled ''Night of the Living Dead'' an "unrelieved [[orgy]] of [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]]" and questioned the "integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers".<ref>''Variety'', review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', October 15, 1968, quoted in Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 184.</ref> ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] referred to the film as a "junk movie" as well as "spare, uncluttered, but really silly."<ref>Vincent Canby, "Getting Beyond Myra and The Valley of the Junk", New York ''Times'', July 5, 1970, p. 49.</ref>

Since the release, critics and film historians have seen ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a subversive film that critiques 1960s American society, international [[Cold War]] politics and domestic [[racism]]. Elliot Stein of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' saw the film as an ardent critique of American involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], arguing that it "was not set in [[Transylvania]], but Pennsylvania <U+2014> this was [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]] at war, and the zombie carnage seemed a grotesque echo of the conflict then raging in [[Vietnam]]".<ref name="Steinreview">Elliot Stein, "The Dead Zones: 'George A.

While George Romero denies he hired Duane Jones simply because he was black, reviewer Mark Deming notes that "the grim fate of Duane Jones, the sole heroic figure and only African-American, had added resonance with the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]] fresh in the minds of most Americans."<ref name="RomeroJones"/><ref>Mark Deming, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', at [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:35311 Allmovie].

== Film series ==
{{Main|Living Dead}}

=== Romero's ''Dead'' Films ===
''Night of the Living Dead'' is the first of six ''...of the Dead'' films directed by George Romero. Following the 1968 film, Romero released ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', ''[[Diary of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Survival of the Dead]]''. Each film traces the evolution of the living dead epidemic in the United States and humanity's desperate attempts to cope with it. As in ''Night of the Living Dead'', Romero peppered the other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods in which they were released.

=== ''Return of the Living Dead'' series ===
The same year ''Day of the Dead'' premiered, ''Night of the Living Dead'' co-writer John Russo released a film titled ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]'' that offers an alternate [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] to the original film than ''Dawn of the Dead'', but acted more as a [[parody]] or [[satire]] and is not considered a sequel to the original 1968 film. Russo's film spawned four [[Return of the Living Dead (film series)|sequels]]. ''Return of the Living Dead'' sparked a legal battle with Romero, who believed Russo marketed his film in direct competition with ''Day of the Dead'' as a sequel to the original film. In the case ''Dawn Associates v. Links'', Romero accused Russo of "appropriat[ing] part of the title of the prior work", [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] ''Dawn of the Dead'''s advertising slogan ("When there is no more room in [[hell]] [...] the dead will walk the earth"), and copying stills from the original 1968 film. Romero was ultimately granted a [[restraining order]] that forced Russo to cease his advertising campaign. Russo, however, was allowed to retain his title.<ref>Patrick J.

=== Remakes and prequels ===
''Night of the Living Dead'' has been [[remake|remade]] twice, with a third announced for a 2010 release. The first remake, debuting in 1990, was directed by special effects artist [[Tom Savini]]. [[Night of the Living Dead (1990 film)|The remake]] was based on the original screenplay, but included more gore and a revised plot that portrayed Barbra<ref>The character's name is spelled ''Barbra'' in the remake, not ''Barbra''.</ref> ([[Patricia Tallman]]) as a capable and active heroine. [[Tony Todd]] played the role of Ben. Film historian Barry Grant saw the new Barbra as a corrective on the part of Romero. He suggests that the character was made stronger to rectify the depiction of female characters in the original film.<ref name="Grant">Barry Keith Grant, "Taking Back the ''Night of the Living Dead'': George Romero, Feminism and the Horror Film" , in ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', ed. Barry K. Grant (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1996), ISBN 978-0-292-72794-6 .</ref> The second remake was in 3-D and released in September 2006 under the title ''[[Night of the Living Dead 3-D]]''. Directed by [[Jeff Broadstreet]]. Unlike Savini's 1990 film, Broadstreet's project was not affiliated with Romero.<ref>''Night of the Living Dead 3-D'' at the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489244/ Internet Movie Database].</ref><ref>''Night of the Living Dead 3-D'' [http://www.nightofthelivingdead3d.com/ official site].

On September 15, 2009, it was announced that [[Simon West]] planned a [[3-D film|3D]] prequel to the original movie, to be titled ''[[Night of the Living Dead: Origins 3D]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33563/night-living-dead-3d-again |title=Night of the Living Dead in 3D Again? |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17391 |title='Night of the Living Dead' Origin Story Told in 3D CGI |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> The movie is being written and directed by Zebediah de Soto.

== Copyright status ==
''Night of the Living Dead'' entered the [[public domain]] because the original theatrical distributor, the Walter Reade Organization, neglected to place a [[copyright]] indication on the prints. In 1968, [[United States copyright law]] required a proper notice for a work to maintain a copyright.<ref>U.S. Copyright Office, Circular 92, ''Copyright Law of the United States of America'', Chapter 4: Copyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration, [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#405 Omission of notice on certain copies and phonorecords].</ref> Image Ten displayed such a notice on the title frames of the film beneath the original title, ''Night of the Flesh Eaters''. The distributor removed the statement when it changed the title.<ref>United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, ''Legal Issues that Arise when Color is Added to Films Originally Produced, Sold and Distributed in Black and White'' (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1988), p. 83.</ref>

Because of the public domain status, the film is sold on home video by many distributors. As of 2006, the [[Internet Movie Database]] lists 23 copies of ''Night of the Living Dead'' retailing on [[DVD]] and nineteen on [[VHS]].<ref>Merchandise for
