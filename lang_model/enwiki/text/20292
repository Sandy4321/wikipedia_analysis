The '''<U+00C9>cole du Louvre''' is an institution of [[higher education]] and French [[Grande <U+00C9>cole]] dedicated to the study of Archaeology, History of Art, Anthropology and Epigraphy.

It is located in the Aile de Flore of the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

Admission is subject to a competitive entrance exam straight after high school, but many candidates apply after one or two years of university studies<ref name="index2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoledulouvre.fr/index2.html |accessdate=2008-04-06 |title=Ecole du Louvre : enseignement, recherche et publications en histoire de l'art |date=2004-11-15}}</ref>.

== History ==

The <U+00C9>cole du Louvre was created in [[1882]] with the mission to "extract from the collections the knowledge they contain, and to train curators, missionaries and excavators". The school was originally dedicated to [[Archaeology]], but soon expanded to related disciplines, such as [[History of Art]], [[Anthropology]] or Ancient Languages<ref name="index2"/>.

The school was created in a context of expansion of higher education in Europe, and in France in particular. This was reflected in the fact that the school did not only provide education to its students, but also held specific lectures for a wider public. This specificity continues to this day with lectures and conferences aimed at fee-paying "auditors", as well as a summer school. Many other prestigious institutions were created around the same time, such as the [[Institut d'<U+00E9>tudes politiques de Paris]] (''Sciences-Po'') or the [[<U+00C9>cole des Hautes <U+00C9>tudes Commerciales]] (''HEC'').

In 1920, the school established its General Art History course (known as ''HGA''), the cornerstone of its teaching, up to the present. In 1927, it created the first chair of [[museology]] in the world. This course would develop into the current graduate program over the following years.

In 1998, following the development of the ''Grand Louvre'', the school moved to its present location in the Aile de Flore, the river-facing wing of the museum.

==Teaching==
[[Image:EdL-Hall.jpg|left|thumb|The entrance hall in the <U+00C9>cole du Louvre.]]
Since 2006, the <U+00C9>cole du Louvre complies with the [[Bologna process]] and offers an undergraduate degree in three years (''Premier Cycle''), a master's degree in two years (''Deuxi<U+00E8>me cycle'') and a research degree in three years (''Troisi<U+00E8>me Cycle''). It also provides preparation classes for some civil service exams as well as conferences for a wider public. Altogether, there are about 700 teaching staff.

A uniqueness of the <U+00C9>cole du Louvre is that selectivity is not limited to the initial competitive entrance exam to the undergraduate program. There is a strong selection between the first and second years, with many students unable to carry on and complete the degree. However, this is not to be equated with a drop-out rate in American or British universities. Rather, it is a manifestation of the French conception of selection towards excellence in higher education.

===Premier cycle===
During their three years at the <U+00C9>cole du Louvre, undergraduate students, known as ''EdLien'', follow a core course called ''HGA''. While lectures take place in an amphitheatre, tutorials take place in various museums and provide a "hands-on" experience with the material studied.

The first year is dedicated to Archaeology, with an emphasis on Classical and Oriental Archaeology.

The second year is centred on the History of Art and Archaeology of the non-Western world, as well as the study of the Renaissance.

The final year focuses on the History of Art in modern times, and on Anthropology.

In addition to the core course, students choose a specialisation area during their first year for the entire duration of the degree, known as ''cours organiques'' or ''sp<U+00E9>''. There are currently 31 specialisations (or ''cours organiques'') to choose from, ranging from [[Iconography]] or Greek Archaeology to European [[Anthropology]] or the History of Cinema.

Moreover, students have the faculty to follow courses in [[Epigraphy]], [[Numismatics]] or [[Modern Languages]].

===Deuxi<U+00E8>me cycle===
[[Image:Ecole Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|The Aile de Flore.]]
The master's program is composed of two years. During the first year, students are taught museology and research methods. At the end of the second year, students have to submit a thesis based on research and work experience.

===Troisi<U+00E8>me cycle===
Although the research program is not formally a doctoral program (delivering a ''dipl<U+00F4>me de recherche approfondie'' instead), the three -or more- years are spent doing extensive academic research under the direction of a supervisor from the '''<U+00C9>cole du Louvre'''.

==Academic partnerships==
The <U+00C9>cole du Louvre has exchange agreements with the [[University of Montr<U+00E9>al]] in [[Qu<U+00E9>bec]], the [[Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti]] in [[Venice]], [[Italy]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]] in [[Germany]].

==Library and publications==
The <U+00C9>cole du Louvre possesses one of the largest Art History and Archeology [[fonds|collections]], which is made available to academics and students.

The <U+00C9>cole du Louvre regularly publishes books, manuals and academic research; often in conjunction with an external publishing house.
