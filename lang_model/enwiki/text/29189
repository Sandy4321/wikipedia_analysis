'''St. Ignatius College Prep''', colloquially known as '''Ignatius''', '''Iggy''' or '''SICP''', is a [[coeducation]]al [[Jesuit]] [[secondary school]] located in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and founded in 1869<ref>[http://www.ignatius.org St. Ignatius College Prep official website]</ref> by Fr. Arnold Damen, S.J.  The school enjoys a selective, academic reputation.  It is located in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]].

==Overview==
The school's main building was designed by the architect [[Toussaint Menard]]<ref name="landmark"/> in the [[Second French Empire]] style, is one of the few buildings in Chicago that predates the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire|Great Fire of 1871]]. The main edifice is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]<ref name="nris">{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/|title=National Register Information System|date=2008-04-15|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref> and was deemed a Chicago Landmark in 1987<ref name="landmark">{{cite web|url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/LandmarksWeb/landmarkDetail.do;jsessionid=LHrKnNPjjLGrwl1798dGhFv6N3p67DkctyhCqMXnynYTz7wFDJx2!-176063537?lanID=1429|title=Chicago Landmarks - St. Ignatius College Prep Building|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> after an extensive restoration. The 19 acre (77,000 m<U+00B2>) campus is located on Chicago's West Side, adjacent to the campus of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. 

Features of the campus besides the 1869 building, include the Richard H. Driehaus "1895" Building, the Chicago Center, the McLaughlin Center and its 370 seat McLaughlin Theatre (with an interior modeled after several European opera houses).  The Grand Gallery and Brunswick Library on the fifth floor of the 1869 building feature a monument to alumni who fought in the [[Spanish-American War]] as well as a collection of notable letters and manuscripts ranging from [[American Civil War]] battle orders to a letter written by author [[Alexandre Dumas, p<U+00E8>re|Alexandre Dumas]].  The Brunswick Library originally housed the collection of Chicago's [[Field Museum of Natural History]] prior to the completion of its construction.

St. Ignatius employs a liberal-arts curriculum.  Besides preparing students for the nation's premiere universities, the school also seeks to educate the entire person, following the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm.  The teacher is merely a guide to knowledge, not the source of knowledge.  St. Ignatius was one of the first and few secondary institutions in the [[United States]] to adopt an integrated science program, in which students accomplish the equivalent of two semesters each of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] during the first and second or second and third years.  Upon completion of the integrated science program students have the option to complete independent research for two semesters in a research laboratory or follow [[Advanced Placement Program|AP]] courses in biology, chemistry, and physics; they may also take elective courses such as [[astronomy]], [[environmental science]], or [[genetics]].  Courses such as [[United Kingdom|British]] literature are incorporated into the core curriculum at St. Ignatius as well as  courses covering university and graduate-level topics such as the historical influence of [[philosophy]] on [[theology]] and [[christology]].  The school is one of the few remaining secondary institutions to offer a complete complement of [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]] courses.  Seven semesters of Religious Studies are included in the required curriculum, one semester during freshman year and two semesters during the last three years.  While the doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]] is the subject of much of these courses, the Freshman year semester is spent on an introduction to the major religions of the world and the Junior year coursework includes the critical study of several theories of human nature in the tradition of [[Western Philosophy]].  These theories have included the work of [[Plato]], [[Freud]], [[Sartre]] and [[B. F. Skinner]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

[[Vocational education]] is not offered to students.  [[Physical Education]] and Health courses are part of the core curriculum, consistent with the requirements of the [[State of Illinois]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

===Founding date questions===
There is currently debate about the actual founding date of St. Ignatius. For many years, in seals, logos, and official documents, the school has maintained that 1870 was the founding year of what was then St. Ignatius College. In January 2006, however, St. Ignatius changed its crest and website to indicate that the school had, in fact, been founded in 1869<U+2014>the year the first building was constructed.  The matter is confused even further by the fact that recent press releases from the school have maintained that the founding date was 1870. 1870 is, however, the year that the first class graduated.

===Tuition===
Tuition for the 2009-2010 school year is $12,380; however, there is a $2,000 gap between the cost of education and tuition. St. Ignatius awarded over $2.3 million in need-based grants to 319 students for 2009-2010.  Over 20% of enrolled students receive some financial aid. Much of the actual cost to operate the school is funded from its relatively vast development initiatives and endowment, including donations and grants from alumni, parents, parents of alumni, wealthy individuals and philanthropists, as well as corporate foundations and Chicago business concerns. St. Ignatius also hosts an annual auction, "Puttin' on the Ritz" in the spring and a golf outing in the summer.

===Mission statement===
:''St. Ignatius College Prep, a Jesuit Catholic school in the heart of Chicago, is a diverse community dedicated to educating men and women for lives of faith, love, service and leadership. Through outstanding teaching and personal formation, the school challenges its talented student body to intellectual excellence, integrity, and life-long learning and growth. Inspired by the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus]], this community strives to use God's gifts to promote social justice for the greater glory of God.''

In the 1850s, Fr. Arnold Damen, S.J., a Jesuit priest, set out to start a parish and college for the academically talented children of immigrants on Chicago's near-West Side, then an area of sprawling prairie. Construction of Damen's [[Holy Family Church]] was completed in 1857. With funds provided by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] financiers, construction of the main building of St. Ignatius College commenced in 1869 with designs by the French architect [[Toussaint Menard]].  On June 30, 1870, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] approved the Charter of St. Ignatius College, and in September, 1870 St. Ignatius opened its doors to thirty-seven young men who had completed the Eighth grade, the extent of formal education during the time period.

St. Ignatius was one of the first colleges in the Chicago area, predating the [[University of Chicago]] by 20 years and graduating its first class little more than a decade after [[Northwestern University]] did so. Students were instructed in [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], the elementary sciences, writing, arithmetic and rhetoric <U+2014> the components of a traditional "college" education of the era. In 1871, disaster struck Chicago in the form of the Great Chicago Fire, but Damen's church and college were one of only a few buildings to be spared from the inferno. Fr. Damen sent a telegraph to [[Pope Pius IX]] early in the day of the fire to ask his Holiness to pray to God to save Holy Family and St. Ignatius and promised to keep a candle lit as a memorial for as long as he lived--today the candle still burns in the school's Cuneo Chapel.    

St. Ignatius continued to grow through the 1870s and 1880s, adding another wing to the 1869 building 1874, and becoming an early pioneer in the new field of x-ray radiography. In 1895, the college's enrollment had expanded substantially enough to warrant the construction of a second building, the 1895 building. Just two years after the debut of electric power on a grand scale at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, St. Ignatius demonstrated its commitment to new technology when the 1895 building was constructed with integrated electric wiring, and the 1869 building was retrofitted to accommodate electricity.  

In the early 20th century, as Chicago's population boomed the enrollment of St. Ignatius increased commensurately. In 1922, St. Ignatius had become so large that the [[Jesuit order]] decided to separate the education of 14-18 year old boys into a "high school" and the education of adult males into a separate entity that became [[Loyola University Chicago]]. Thus, [[St. Ignatius Academy]] was born.  The school continued its mission through the 1950s and 1960s to provide education to boys from all walks of life. However, by the 1970s St. Ignatius' buildings had fallen into disrepair, enrollment was declining, and the school appeared to be poised to become a victim of [[urban decay]]. Fundraising initiatives begun in the 1970s, such as the "Walk for Ignatius" and annual benefits (the first headlined by Bob Hope in 1976) helped revive the school's financial health.

In 1980, the school bowed to the pressure of alumni with daughters and began to admit girls. The infusion of females caused enrollment to climb. In 1981, Fr. Donald H. Rowe, S.J. was selected by the Board of Trustees as the school's new President. A charismatic, dynamic, and controversial figure, Rowe immediately stated his intention to begin a renaissance for St. Ignatius. Rowe began a campaign in 1986 to completely restore the 1869 and 1895 buildings, the latter of which was renamed the [[Richard H. Driehaus Building]]. Additionally, Rowe set his sights on making St. Ignatius a repository of antique art linked to Chicago's storied past. $60 million was spent restoring the two buildings to their original architectural designs, including renovations room by room to restore the building, its flooring, paneling, paint, fixtures, etc. to be consistent with those of the late 19th century. The renovation and restoration continues to this day.  St. Ignatius is recognized on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In 2001-2002 the exterior of the 1869 building was renovated again and the slate roof and the decorative copper gutters replaced, with a stated effort to preserve the building for "centuries to come".  

During the 1990s Rowe embarked upon a campaign to construct two entirely new buildings to specification design and furnishings to match that of the 19th century French architectural style of the 1869 and Driehaus Buildings, creating a pastiche of re-creations of lost Chicago architecture. This round of construction commenced in 1994 and culminated with the Chicago and McLaughlin Centers' full completion in 2004. The school was also an early-adopter of high-speed [[Internet]] technology, and in 1999 became one of the first schools in the [[United States]] to become fully [[Wi-Fi]] enabled.

==Recent history==
{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}

On [[December 22]], [[1998]], the Trustees named Fr. Brian G. Paulson, S.J., a graduate of [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard Universities]], the 28th President of St. Ignatius. He has continued much of the work Fr. Rowe began, and has proven to be one of the more memorable Presidents in the school's 135-year history. Paulson has also overseen an expansion of the school's [[financial aid]] grants by 50% and the school's highest number of applicants ever, in which nearly 1,000 students applied for 320 spots for the Class of 2006. President Paulson has remained largely free of criticism from all parties, although the principal for the first part of his tenure, Dr. William Watts, was ousted in 2003. He was replaced by an interim principal Mrs. Carole Manning (one of the former assistant principals) for the 2003-04 school year. Dr. Catherine Karl was then chosen as the new principal in 
2004.

===Hurricane Katrina relief effort===
St. Ignatius Principal Dr. Catherine Karl announced on [[August 31]], [[2005]] that the school would begin to accept displaced students from [[New Orleans]]' [[Jesuit High School]] as visiting students.  St. Ignatius plans to waive tuition for any student from Jesuit High School.  Dr. Karl also announced that the school was in need of host families to house the displaced students for the duration of the academic term.  Priority was to be given to seniors at Jesuit High School, so that they would be able to complete their education on time and attend college next year.  St. Ignatius was already two-weeks into its fall term at the time the announcement was made. 

==Athletics==
St. Ignatius competes in the [[Chicago Catholic League]] (CCL) and is a member of the [[Illinois High School Association]] (IHSA) which governs msot sports and competitive activities in the state.  The school's teams are stylized as the "Wolfpack".
