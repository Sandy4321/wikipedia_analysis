Set in 1960, the game places the player in the role of a plane crash survivor named Jack, who must explore the underwater [[dystopia]]n (or failed utopian<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=138851|title=Xbox Preview: BioShock|publisher=CVG|date=2006-05-03|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref>) city of Rapture, and survive attacks by the mutated beings and mechanical [[Drone (bee)|drone]]s that populate it. The game incorporates elements found in [[computer role-playing game|role-playing]] and [[survival horror]] games, and is described by the developers and Levine as a "[[spiritual successor]]" to their previous titles in the ''[[System Shock]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/bioshock/707256p1.html | title=GameSpy: ''BioShock'' Preview | date = [[2006-05-10]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher= Gamespy |  first=  Li C. | last = Kuo }}</ref><ref>{{citeweb | url = http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/556/556421p1.html | title = IGN ''BioShock'' Interview | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2004-10-04]] | accessdate = 2007-10-07}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''BioShock'' is a [[first-person shooter]] with [[role-playing game]] customization and stealth elements, and is similar to ''[[System Shock 2]]''.

The player takes the role of Jack who aims to fight his way through Rapture, using weapons and [[plasmid]]s that give him special powers such as [[telekinesis]] or the ability to electrocute, incinerate or freeze foes, unleash an insect swarm on foes, or enrage them. Security cameras and foes can be evaded by stealth; alternatively, security cameras 
and turrets can be destroyed using weapons or hacked to use them to the player's advantage.<ref>{{cite web| url =

is based on the ''[[Pipe Dream (video game)|Pipe Dream]]'' game concept, can also be used on health dispensers and vending machines to gain extra benefits, and on locks and safes to gain access to the secured contents.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360reviews/fr/bioshockrev.htm | title = ''BioShock'' Review (X360) at Xbox.about.com | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | first = Eric | last = Qualls | publisher = [[About.com]]}}</ref>

[[Image:Bioshock enemies.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A Big Daddy defends a Little Sister from two Splicers, while the player watches.]]

The main resources in the game are ''ADAM'', ''EVE'', and money. ADAM is a [[mutagen]], which allows [[gene therapy|genetic changes]]. Quantities of ADAM can be used to purchase plasmids and other genetic mutations at special "Gatherers Gardens" vending machines throughout the game. ADAM can be obtained in several ways, most prominently the harvesting of "Little Sisters" after defeating their bodyguards, the [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|"Big Daddies"]], who are large, heavily armored, genetically enhanced humans wearing armored [[diving suit]]s. EVE acts as fuel for "active plasmids" in a manner similar to [[magic point]]s in other games, while money allows the purchase of items and ammunition, as well as paying to override security elements, such as bots or turrets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ggmania.com/full.php3?show=5856 | title = Gameguru reviews ''BioShock'' | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date = [[2007-09-17]] | publisher = Game Guru Mania}}</ref>

It is here that morality is implemented as an aspect of the gameplay; the player can choose to either rescue the Little Sisters, or harvest their ADAM (resulting in their death). While both choices have their advantages, this element of conflicting morals has an impact on the storyline, and, among other things, on the difficulty of the game itself.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/32465?from=30&comments_per_page=30 | title = ''BioShock'' morality | first Julian | last = Murdoch | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher = Gamers With Jobs | date = [[2007-06-05]]}}</ref>

To adapt and advance the character, the player can purchase plasmids, using ADAM. These are grouped under the Combat, Engineering, Active, and Physical [[technology tree]]s. The "Active" plasmids are abilities that function as alternate weapons; they are powered by EVE, and require activation by the player. The other classes of plasmids, referred to as "Tonics," are passive abilities that work as long as they are selected as equipment ("equipped").<ref>{{cite web | url = http://compactiongames.about.com/od/reviews/fr/bioshock_rev.htm | title = ''BioShock'' Review (PC) by About.com | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher = [[About.com]] | first = Michael | last = Klappenbach}}</ref>

Plasmids are versatile, and can be used by the player both in concert with each other and with the environment to create numerous effects. For example, "telekinesis" can be used on all loose objects: the player can catch and redirect grenades, rockets, thrown items, or hold large objects to form impromptu shields, or use those same objects as projectiles. Other types of plasmids have different practical uses; for instance, using an "electro-bolt" on a body of water electrifies not only the water, but also any beings and machines within it. The player is also encouraged to use critical thinking in the use of plasmids; for instance, a player may use "incinerate" to set an enemy on fire, and when the enemy jumps into a body of water to smother the flames, use "electro-bolt" to kill the enemy instantly. An element of choice is present: since not all plasmids can be equipped at once, the player must decide which plasmids to use, and which to place in storage.<ref name="bit-tech">{{citeweb | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/3 | title = ''BioShock'' Gameplay Review (page 2) | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date = [[2007-08-21]] | first = Joe | last = Martin | publisher = [[Bit-tech]]}}</ref>
[[Image:Bioshock-hack.jpg|right|thumb|The hacking [[minigame]] in ''BioShock'', which requires the player to construct a complete pipe system between two points while avoiding obstacles.]]
Most plasmids alter the character's appearance, in keeping with the theme of "sacrificing one's humanity," referenced by Ryan in one of the game's trailers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player.php?id=13583&type=mov&pl=game; | title = X06 Trailer | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher = [[GameTrailers]]}}</ref> For instance, the ''incinerate'' plasmid causes the character's left hand to glow red, take on a charred appearance, and radiate flames from the fingers. However, selecting a weapon shows that the right hand is unaffected, and changing to a different plasmid reverts the changes, suggesting that any physical changes conferred are temporary. Higher levels of the same plasmid will cause more extreme changes; for example, the highest level of ''incinerate'' causes a heavier glow, more severe charring, and more prominent flames. In all, there are over 70 unique plasmids and tonics varieties.

Via single-use weapon-upgrade kiosks called "Power to the People" machines, the player can customize weapons to hold larger magazines, consume ammunition at a slower rate, or cause more damage. Each weapon has a selection of three different types of ammunition: normal, anti-personnel, and armor-piercing bullets are available for the weapons found early in the game; later weapons such as the [[crossbow]] have more diverse types of ammunition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/5 | title = ''BioShock'' Gameplay Review "The little things" | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date = [[2007-08-21]] | first = Joe | last = Martin | publisher = [[Bit-tech]]}}</ref> There is also a "research camera" in the game that analyzes enemies. After taking enough pictures of any given enemy, the player is granted increased damage, plasmids, and other bonuses when facing that type of enemy in future battles. The quality of the photograph determines the rate at which these advantages are rewarded.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamebanshee.com/bioshock/weapons/researchcamera.php | title = Research Camera | accessdate = 2007-11-10 | publisher = GameBanshee}}</ref>

The player can also access several types of vending machines: the "U-Invent," which combines retrievable spare parts into ammunition, tools, etc.; "The Circus of Values" vending machine sells everything from cakes to first aid kits to EVE hypos; the "El Ammo Bandito!," a machine that vends both normal and specialty ammunition; and other more specialized machines, such as health stations. Most vending machine varieties can be hacked, allowing the player to buy "hack-only" items, and reducing the cost of the previously available merchandise.<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://gametz.com/Review/1654.html | title = ''BioShock'' (Xbox 360) review by Gametz | author = CenturionElite | accessdate = 2007-11-16 | date = [[2007-08-29]]}}</ref> Glass-walled "Vita-Chambers" can also be found throughout the game, which the player does not use directly. Instead, should Jack die, his body is reconstituted at the nearest one, retaining all of his possessions, but only a portion of his full health.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/795/795080p1.html | title = BioShock Hands-on | first = Charles | last = Onyett | date = [[2007-06-08]] | publisher = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04}}</ref>

''BioShock'' is set during 1960, in Rapture, a [[fiction]]al underwater [[dystopia]]n city.<ref name="bit-tech"/> The history of Rapture is learned by the player through audio recordings as he explores the city. Secretly built in 1946 on the mid-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[seabed]], Rapture was entirely self-sufficient and [[geothermal power|powered]] by [[submarine volcano]]es. Constructed by [[business magnate]] Andrew Ryan (voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]), Rapture was envisioned as the solution to what he saw as increasingly oppressive political, economical, and religious authority. The city was populated by those whom Ryan believed exemplified the best in humanity. Because it was full of the cream of mankind, there were several breakthroughs in technology in Rapture, such as the rapid advancement of genetic engineering technology, as well as the wartime invention of steampunk style upgrade stations. It was revealed in an audio log that Ryan wanted Rapture to become an "[[Garden of Eden|Eden]]," a concept furthered by the resources ADAM and EVE, which are named after the [[Adam and Eve|biblical inhabitants]] of Eden. During the early 1950s, Rapture's population peaked at several thousand, though an elite emerged, discomforting many of the inhabitants. <ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/rapture.html|title=What is Rapture?|publisher=Cult of Rapture|accessdate = 2007-10-07}}</ref>

The development of ADAM&mdash;[[stem cell]]s harvested from a previously unknown species of [[Nudibranch|sea slug]]&mdash;by Dr. Bridgette Tennenbaum further upset the social balance. ADAM's prevalence greatly accelerated [[genetic engineering]] research, creating a [[plasmid]] industry that sold everything from a cure for [[male pattern baldness]] to skills like [[telekinesis]], with non-passive types like the latter requiring a serum, EVE. In order to improve ADAM yields, Rapture scientists created the "Little Sisters," young girls, each with a slug embedded in her body. Although initially just ADAM "factories," during the war that later broke out, they were repurposed via [[mental conditioning]] to extract ADAM from the dead, and recycle it within themselves.<ref name="IGN water">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.ign.com/Irrational_Games/2007/05/23/55572/ | title = IGN first look at the Little Sisters | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-05-23]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04}}</ref> At the same time, the scientists created "Big Daddies" (voiced by [[Stephen Stanton]]), armed and highly enhanced humans in [[standard diving dress|diving suits]], to defend the Little Sisters as they worked.<ref name="bit-tech" />

For several years, Rapture was what Ryan originally intended it to be: a paradise of freedom and wealth. But ultimately, the very reason it was created&mdash;Ryan's hatred of authority&mdash;caused the city's downfall, and the ideals Ryan had envisaged to be corrupted and lost. To keep his utopia a secret, Ryan passed a single law: contact with the surface was prohibited. This edict made [[smuggling]] profitable, resulting in the formation of a small [[black market]]. This market came to be dominated by a man with just as much determination as Ryan: former mobster and accomplished con-artist Frank Fontaine (voiced by [[Greg Baldwin]]). Unlike Ryan, however, Fontaine wanted control. His wealth, combined with his monopoly on Tennenbaum's research, soon gained Fontaine enough power and followers to challenge Ryan for control of the city.

In late 1958, Ryan lost patience with the conflict and had Fontaine killed, an action that proved useless as another figure, Atlas (voiced by [[Hanover, Karl|Karl Hanover]]), took Fontaine's place as the leader of the opposition. On [[New Year's Eve]] that year, Atlas and his ADAM-augmented followers fomented a riot involving the lower and upper classes.<ref name="shacknews spoiler interview"/> This sparked a civil war between Ryan and Atlas that eventually spread to all of Rapture, crippling the city. As the war progressed, Ryan began to betray his ideals. The former advocate of reason and self-determination began using [[torture]] and [[mind control]] in his battle with Atlas. Eventually, he became so unreasonable that a number of his supporters attempted to assassinate him. By the time the player enters Rapture, only the "Splicers"&mdash;citizens with severe mental and physical problems caused by excessive ADAM use&mdash;are left, scavenging throughout the city. The remaining non-mutated humans have managed to barricade themselves in the few remaining undamaged areas, although most of these people are nonetheless mentally unstable or dangerous in some way.<ref name="IGN review">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813214p1.html | title = ''BioShock'' Review | publisher = [[IGN]] | last = Onyett | first = Charles | date = [[2007-08-16]] | accessdate= 2007-08-16}}</ref>

===Story===
[[Image:Bioshock-rapture.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The underwater city of Rapture]]
At the start of the game, Jack (the player protagonist) is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/813/813641p1.html|title=''BioShock'' Review: Welcome to Rapture; at IGN|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=7 October 2007}}</ref> after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.bioshock-online.com/faq/#about|title=''BioShock'' FAQs <U+2013> What is the game about?|accessdate = 2007-10-08|date=2006-12-30|publisher = Through the Looking Glass}}</ref> After surfacing, Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash, and swims to a nearby towering lighthouse sitting in the middle of the water, where he finds a [[bathysphere (vessel)|bathysphere]] which he uses to descend into the ocean and enter the failed "paradise" of Rapture.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/objects/793/793105.html|title=''BioShock''|publisher= IGN|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Atlas assists Jack via the service radio found in the bathysphere in making his way to safety, while Ryan, believing Jack to be a government agent (though he's not sure ''which'' government), uses Rapture's automated systems and his [[pheromone]]-controlled Splicers against him. Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids, and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM. Overhearing Atlas' words, Dr. Tennenbaum intercepts Jack, and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead. She gives him a special plasmid that will kill only the embedded slugs while leaving the girls alive and restoring their humanity, albeit with a much smaller reward of ADAM for Jack. Tennenbaum promises to repay him if he does as she asks.<ref name="IGN water"/> As Jack works his way through the city, he learns about Rapture's fate and history through audio logs, genetically-induced ghostly playbacks of past events, and radio messages. Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine, and just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located, Ryan has it destroyed; an enraged Atlas tells Jack that Ryan must die.

Jack makes his way to Ryan, who offers no resistance to Jack's efforts, but instead reveals why Jack has come to Rapture: Jack was actually born in Rapture a mere two years ago, genetically modified to mature rapidly. He is Ryan's illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene, an entertainer. Ryan further reveals that, after purchasing Jack's embryo, Frank Fontaine designed him to obey orders that are preceded or followed by the specific phrase "Would you kindly." Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryan's reach. When the conflict between Fontaine and Ryan reached a stalemate, Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package. At a designated time he opened the package to discover a revolver like the one found in the game, and instructions to hijack and crash the plane next to the lighthouse, enabling him to return to Rapture as the [[The Monkey and the Cat|cat's-paw]] of Atlas. Ryan calmly demonstrates Jack's lack of free will by forcing him to follow his commands using the trigger phrase, "Would you kindly<U+2026>" which the player then realizes Atlas has been using since his arrival, letting you know that Atlas has been controlling Jack the entire time. Ryan then orders Jack to kill him, so as to die on his own terms. Atlas, in complete control of the city as a result of Ryan's death, reveals himself to be Frank Fontaine, having faked his own death and adopted the alias and persona of Atlas to throw Ryan off his trail. With Ryan dead, Fontaine no longer needs Jack, and leaves him at the mercy of the reactivated security systems.  Nevertheless, Dr. Tennenbaum and her Little Sisters help Jack escape through the vent system, where he falls and loses consciousness.

When Jack awakes, Dr. Tennenbaum has already deactivated some of his conditioned responses (such as the trigger phrase itself) and assists him in breaking the remaining ones, among them one that would have eventually stopped his heart. During their subsequent pursuit of Fontaine, the doctor predicts that the only way to get through the last few obstacles would be to assemble a Big Daddy [[diving suit]] and follow the rescued Little Sisters through the passageways that only they can open. By the time Jack reaches him, Fontaine has injected himself with vast amounts of ADAM, becoming an inhuman monster. Jack and Fontaine battle, and Jack eventually prevails, allowing the Little Sisters to subdue Fontaine, by swarming over Fontaine and stabbing him with their needles, killing him by draining all the ADAM out of his system. Here the game ends.

Three endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, all narrated by Dr. Tennenbaum. If the player rescued all the Little Sisters (therefore saving their lives), the ending shows the rescued Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care, including their graduating from college, getting married, and having children; it ends on a heart-warming tone, with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all of the adult Little Sisters. If the player harvested (and therefore killed) more than one, but not all, of the Little Sisters, the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine, presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/793105/page_4.html|title=Guides: BioShock Guide (Xbox 360), BioShock Walkthrough|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref> Tennenbaum's voice narrates what occurred, condemning Jack and his actions. Later in the second ending, a [[ballistic missile submarine]] carrying a nuclear missile comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers. The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it.<ref name="bioshock walkthrough"> {{citeweb|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/bioshock/walkthrough/fontaineslair.php|title=BioShock <U+2013> Fontaine's Lair Walkthrough |publisher=GameBanshee|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> If the player harvested ''all'' of the Little Sisters, the player is shown the same movie as the second ending, though the tone of Tennenbaum's voice is a more disappointed and angrier one.<ref name="endings"> {{citeweb|url=http://guides.gamepressure.com/bioshock/guide.asp?ID=3351|title=BioShock <U+2013> Little Sisters and Big Daddies (SPOILERS!) <U+2013> Game Guide|publisher=GamePressure|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref>

Originally, ''BioShock'' had a storyline which was significantly different from that of the released version: the main character was a "cult deprogrammer"<U+2014>a person charged with rescuing someone from a [[cult]], and mentally and psychologically readjusting that person to a normal life.<ref name="shacknews original story">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48731 | title = Levine: ''BioShock'' Originally About Cult Deprogrammer (Updated) | date=2007-08-30 | accessdate = 2007-08-31 | first = Chris | last = Remo | publisher = Shacknews}}</ref> For example, Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: "[There are] people who hired people to [for example] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [kind of] character that you were."<ref name="shacknews spoiler interview">{{cite web | title = Ken Levine on ''BioShock'': The Spoiler Interview | url = http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=539 | date=  [[2007-08-20]] | accessdate = 2007-08-31| first = Chris | last = Remo | publisher = Shacknews }}</ref> This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a [[Senator]].<ref name="shacknews spoiler interview"/> By the time development on ''BioShock'' was officially revealed in 2004, the story and setting had changed significantly. The game now took place in an abandoned World War II-era underground laboratory, which had recently been unearthed by 21st century scientists. The genetic experiments within the labs had gradually formed themselves into an ecosystem, centered around three "castes" of creatures, referred to as "drones," "soldiers," and "predators." This "AI ecology" would eventually form the basis for the "Little Sister," "Big Daddy," and "Splicer" dynamic seen in the completed game.<ref>{{cite web | title = BioShock First Look - Exclusive First Impressions | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/bioshock/news.html?sid=6110044 | date= 2004-10-10 | accessdate = 2008-08-02| first = Andrew | last = Park | publisher = Gamespot }}</ref>   

While the gameplay with this story was similar to what resulted in the released version of the game, the story underwent changes, consistent with what Levine says was then-Irrational Games's guiding principle of putting game design first.<ref name = "shacknews original story"/>  Levine also noted that "it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6179423.html | title = Q&A: Diving deeper into ''BioShock''s story | date= [[2007-09-20]] | accessdate = 2007-09-20 | publisher = Gamespot | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair }}</ref>

In response to an interview question from the gaming website [[IGN]] about what influenced the game's story and setting, Levine said, "I have my useless [[liberal arts]] degree, so I've read stuff from [[Ayn Rand]] and [[George Orwell]], and all the sort of utopian and dystopian writings of the 20th century, which I've found really fascinating."<ref name="ign myths">{{citeweb|url=http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/704/704806p1.html|title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames | first = Douglass C. | last = Perry | publisher = IGN | date = [[2006-05-26]] | accessdate = 2007-10-07}}</ref> Levine has also mentioned an interest in "stem cell research and the moral issues that go around <nowiki>[it]</nowiki>."<ref name="ign myths"/>  In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run]]'', representing societies that have "really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456 | title = Big Daddy speaks  | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | first = Johnny | last = Minkley | date = [[2007-06-08]] | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>

According to the developers, ''BioShock'' is a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[System Shock]]'' games, and was produced by former developers of that series. Levine claims his team had been thinking about making another game in the same vein since they produced ''[[System Shock 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=103 | title = Ken Levine on the making of ''BioShock'' | publisher = Rock, Paper, Shotgun | date = [[2007-08-20]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | first = Kieron | last = Gillen}}</ref> In his narration of a video initially screened for the press at [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]] 2006, Levine pointed out many similarities between the games.<ref name="multiple">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/bioshock/news.html?page=1&sid=6150533&tag=result;title;0 | title=E3 06: ''BioShock'' Gameplay Demo Impressions | publisher = Gamespot | date=2006-05-10|accessdate = 2007-11-04 | author = Brad Shoemaker and Andrew Park }}</ref> There are several comparable gameplay elements: plasmids in ''BioShock'' serve the same function as "Psionic Abilities" in ''System Shock 2''; the player needs to deal with security cameras, machine gun turrets, and hostile robotic drones, and has the ability to hack them in both games; ammunition conservation is stressed as "a key gameplay feature"; and audio tape recordings fulfil the same storytelling role that [[e-mail]] logs did in the ''System Shock'' games.<ref name="multiple"/>  The "ghosts" (phantom images that replay tragic incidents in the places they occurred) from ''System Shock 2'' also exist in ''BioShock'',<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/6|title=''BioShock'' Gameplay Review <U+2013> Overlooked details|accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date = [[2007-08-21]] | first= Joe | last = Martin | publisher = Bit-Tech}}</ref> as do modifiable weapons with multiple ammunition types. Additionally, Atlas guides the player along by radio, in much the same way Janice Polito does in ''System Shock 2'', with each having a similar twist mid-game. Both games also give the player more than one method of completing tasks, allowing for [[emergent gameplay]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/interviews/bioshock1.php|title=''BioShock'' Interview | publisher =  Gamebanshee|date = [[2007-06-13]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04|first=Jon | last = Birnbaum}}</ref>

===Game engine===
''BioShock'' uses a highly modified version of the [[Unreal engine#Unreal Engine 2|Unreal Engine 2.5]] technology used by other previous Irrational Games titles including ''[[SWAT 4]]'', and ''[[SWAT 4#The Stetchkov Syndicate expansion|SWAT 4: The Stetchkov Syndicate]]''. In an interview at E3 in May 2006, Levine announced a switch to a modified [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 3|Unreal Engine 3.0]]. However, despite Levine's claim, BioShock is still built on Unreal Engine 2.5 technology, with some Unreal Engine 3 features integrated into BioShock by Irrational, 2K Boston, and 2K Australia. Levine emphasized the enhanced water effects, which he claimed would be very impressive: "We've hired a water programmer and water artist, just for this game, and they're kicking ass and you've never seen water like this."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://360.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=7461&pg=3 | title=E3 06: ''BioShock'' Interview Transcript | date=2006-05-18|accessdate = 2007-05-18 | publisher = Advanced Media Network | first = Eric | last = Topf}}</ref> This graphical enhancement has been lauded by critics, with [[GameSpot]] saying, "Whether it's standing water on the floor or sea water rushing in after an explosion, it will blow you away every time you see it."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock/review.html?page=1 | title=''Bioshock'' | date=2007-08-21 | accessdate =2007-08-21 | first = Jeff | last = Gerstmann | publisher= Gamespot}}</ref> The Windows version of ''BioShock'' can utilize [[Direct3D|Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10)]] features and content, if the system meets the hardware and software requirements,<ref name="BioFAQs 2" /> but it will also run on DirectX 9, if these requirements are not met, or if the video options are changed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/updates.html | title=DX10 Update | publisher = Cult of Rapture | date= [[2007-04-25]]|accessdate=2007-05-06 | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey }}</ref> There are a few differences in image quality between the two APIs, such as additional water reflections and soft particle effects,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://au.gamespot.com/features/6177688/index.html | title = BioShock Hardware Performance Guide | first = Sarju | last = Shah | date = [[2007-08-26]] | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | publisher = Gamespot AU}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/30/bioshock_gameplay_graphics_and_performance/1 | title = BioShock: Graphics & Performance | date = [[2007-08-30]] | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | first =  Tim | last = Smalley | publisher = Bit-Tech}}</ref> but are otherwise subtle from the player's perspective.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,2174758,00.asp | title=''BioShock Image Quality: DX9 Vs.

Chris Kline, lead programmer of ''BioShock'' from Irrational Games, deemed ''BioShock'' as "heavily [[Simultaneous multithreading|multithreaded]]" as it has the following elements running separately:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=109427&page=2 | title= Anyone else upgrading their pcs in anticipation of Bioshock? | date=2007-11-18|accessdate = 2007-11-18 | publisher =TTLG Forums | first = Chris | last = Kline}}</ref>

A demo was released on [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] on August 12, 2007,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/08/12/demo-bioshock.aspx | title = Demo: BioShock | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | first = Larry | last = Hyrb | date = [[2007-08-12]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04}}</ref> and the PC demo was officially released on August 20, 2007, and announced during [[Larry Hryb]]'s (Major Nelson) interview with Ken Levine on his [[podcast]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/08/12/show-239-wma-the-one-about-the-bioshock-demo-with-ken-levine.aspx | title = Show #239 (WMA) The one about the BioShock demo with Ken Levine | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | first = Larry | last = Hyrb | date = [[2007-08-12]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}</ref> The demo contains the first 45 minutes of the game and includes a cinematic opening sequence that established the setting and initial plot lines, and the tutorial phase of the game.<ref name="bit-tech" /> The demo also contained some differences from the release version such as an extra plasmid and weapons, alongside an earlier security system presence. These were introduced to give players access to several features of the full game. In nine days, the ''BioShock'' demo outperformed every other demo release on [[Xbox Live]] and became the fastest demo to reach one million downloads.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.xboxworld.com.au/news/bioshock-sets-new-xbox-live-marketplace-record.htm |title= ''bioshock'' sets new xbox live marketplace record |publisher = Xbox World Australia | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date =[[2007-07-09]] }}</ref>  The Steam demo was released on August 20, the day before the Steam release, and the [[Playstation 3]] demo was released on the [[Playstation Store]] on October 2, 2008.

===Updates===
On September 6, 2007, the Xbox 360 version of ''BioShock'' received an update: "Improves general game stability, especially when loading autosaves. It also tweaks the way enemies use health stations and fixes a slight audio glitch during menu loading."<ref name="nelsonupdate">{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/09/06/bioshock-title-update.aspx | title = ''BioShock'' Title update | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | last = Hryb | first = Larry | date=2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2007-09-09}}</ref> Users were prompted to download the automatic update when they next started the game.<ref name="nelsonupdate" /> The update has, however, been criticized for introducing several problems to the game, including occasional freezes, bad [[framerate]]s, and even audio-related issues.<ref name="updateprobs">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48832 | title = BioShock X360 Update Solves, Introduces Issues (Updated) | publisher = Shacknews | first = Chris | last = Faylor | date = [[2007-09-07]] | accessdate = 2007-11-14}}</ref>  The problem seems to be with the game's [[cache|caching]], and can be corrected by the user.<ref name="updateprobs" />

On December 4, 2007, a patch for the Windows version, and a title update and free downloadable content for the Xbox 360 version were released. In addition to correcting bugs in the software, the patch/new content introduces a horizontal field-of-view option, new Plasmids, an option to disable Vita Chambers, and an additional achievement in the Xbox 360 version for completing the game without using any Vita Chambers on Hard mode ("Brass Balls," 100 points). Vita Chambers need not be disabled to earn the achievement, and quick saves can still be used.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/pcpatch.html | title = BioShock PC Patch, Xbox 360 Title update and Downloadable Content | date = [[2007-12-03]] | accessdate = 2007-12-03 | publisher = Cult of Rapture | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey }}</ref>

An update for the PS3 version was released on the 13th of November to fix some small graphical problems and rare occasions where users experienced a hang and were forced to reset the console. This update also incorporated the Challenge Room and New Game Plus features.

===Other versions===
In an August 2007 interview, when asked about the possibility of a [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''BioShock'', Ken Levine had stated only that there was "no PS3 development going on" at the time;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/24/levine-confirms-no-ps3-bioshock-and-does-mea-culpa-on-pc-issues/ | title = Levine confirms no PS3 ''BioShock'' and does mea culpa on PC issues -- success hurts | publisher = Joystiq | date=2007-08-24 | accessdate = 2007-08-24 | first = Alexander | last = Sliwinski }}</ref> however, on May 28, 2008, [[2K Games]] confirmed that a PlayStation 3 version of the game was in development by [[2K Marin]], and it was released on October 17, 2008.<ref name=ps3pressrls/>  Jordan Thomas was the director for the PlayStation 3 version.

''BioShock'' has received wide critical acclaim:<ref name="Metacritic score (Xbox 360)"/><ref name="Metacritic score (PC)"/> mainstream press reviews have praised the immersive qualities of the game and its political dimension. The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' described it as "a beautiful, brutal, and disquieting computer game&nbsp;... one of the best in years,"<ref name="bostonglobereview">{{cite web | url = http://www.boston.com/ae/games/articles/2007/08/27/bioshock_lets_users_take_on_fanaticism_through_fantasy/ | title = ''BioShock'' lets users take on fanaticism through fantasy | publisher = [[Boston Globe]] | date = [[2007-08-27]] | first=  Hiawatha | last = Bray | accessdate = 2007-11-09 }}</ref> and compared the game to [[Whittaker Chambers]]'s 1957 riposte to ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', ''Big Sister Is Watching You''. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' also mentioned the Ayn Rand connection in a report on the game which featured a brief interview with Levine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/15-09/pl_games | title = ''BioShock'' owes more to Ayn Rand than Doom | first =Kieron | last =  Gillen | date = [[2007-08-21]] | publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review said, "I never once thought anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is essentially what 2K Games has done&nbsp;... the rare, mature video game that succeeds in making you think while you play."

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review concluded, "Sure, it's fun to play, looks spectacular and is easy to control. But it also does something no other game has done to date: It really makes you feel."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.game.co.uk/News/?lid=8845&ad=12_03_2008|title=Los Angeles Times review|accessdate=2008-06-10|publisher=Game.co.uk}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer described it as: "intelligent, gorgeous, occasionally frightening" and added, "Anchored by its provocative, morality-based story line, sumptuous art direction and superb voice acting, ''BioShock'' can also hold its head high among the best games ever made."<ref name="nytimesreport">{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/arts/television/08shoc.html?ex=1346904000&en=f4891059b252959b&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink | title = Genetics gone haywire and predatory children in an undersea metropolis | first = Seth | last =  Schiesel | publisher = New York Times | date = [[2007-09-08]] | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref>

It's no longer just another shooter wrapped up in a pretty game engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic game world ever conceived."<ref name="Eurogamer review" />

Reviewers did highlight a few negative issues in ''BioShock'', however. The recovery system involving "Vita-Chambers," which revive a defeated player at half-life, but do not alter the enemies' health, makes it possible to wear down enemies through sheer perseverance, and was criticised as one of the biggest flaws in the gameplay.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=170293 | title=''BioShock'' Review | work=Computer And Video Games | publisher=Xbox World 360 Magazine | accessdate=2007-07-24 | date = [[2007-08-16]] | first = Alex | last = Dale}}</ref> IGN noted that both the controls and graphics of the Xbox 360 version are inferior to those of the PC version, in that switching between weapons or plasmids is easier using the PC's mouse than the 360's radial menu, as well as the graphics being slightly better with higher resolutions.<ref name="IGN review"/> The game has been touted as a hybrid [[first person shooter]] [[role-playing game]], but two reviewers found advances from comparable games lacking, both in the protagonist and in the challenges he faces.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21212 | title = ''Bioshock'' review | publisher = Yale Daily News | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date = [[2007-09-07]] | author = S.T.

Users found that even if they uninstalled the game prior to reinstallation, they were still required to call SecuROM to re-activate the game. The issue was worsened by the fact that the incorrect telephone number had been included in the printed manual, as well as essentially forcing customers outside the United States to make expensive international calls to the US. In response, 2K Games and SecuROM increased the number of activations to five before requiring the user to call again. However, as no information had been provided by 2K on the existence of these measures prior to the game going on sale, or on the retail box of the game itself, many remain dissatisfied. Users also found that it was necessary to activate the game for each user on the same machine, which was criticized by some as an attempt to limit customers' fair use rights.<ref name="maxconsole_user_act">{{cite_web| url=http://www.maxconsole.net/?mode=news&newsid=20470| title="2K: Tell your brother to buy his own Bioshock, you didn't buy it for the whole family"| date=2007-09-04| publisher=[http://www.maxconsole.net/ maxconsole.net]| accessdate = 2007-11-12}}</ref><ref name="neoseeker_user_act">{{cite_web| url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/story/7091/| title=One copy of BioShock per family (member)?| publisher=Neoseeker| date=2007-09-05| accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>  2K Games has denied that this was the intent of the limitation.<ref name="2kgames_user_act">{{cite_web| url=http://forums.2kgames.com/forums/showpost.php?p=191631&postcount=2347| title=2K Games forum post by Jakester| publisher=[[2K Games]] forums| date=2007-09-04| accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

Two months after the initial release, 2K attempted to alleviate customer complaints by developing a special pre-uninstallation utility to refund activation slots to the user.<ref name="revoketool">{{cite web | url=http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/revoketool.html | title=2K Revocation tool download page | date = [[2007-11-03]] | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | publisher  = Cult of Rapture | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey }}</ref> This tool however does not address situations where the game has been installed on a PC which uses more than one user account as it only works once per PC (unlike activations which are counted per user-account), nor is it able to revoke an activation if the installation has become unusable, for example by hard disk failure, effectively rendering such activations permanently lost. 2K Games has specifically mentioned each of these issues in the revoke tool FAQ,<ref name="revoketool"/> and have stated that until software solutions are found for such situations they will handle any further requests for additional activations past the five-activation limit on a case-by-case basis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/support/revoketool/ | title=2K Revocation tool support page | date = [[2007-11-03]] | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | publisher  = Cult of Rapture | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey }}</ref>

As of June 19, 2008, 2K Games has removed the activation limit, allowing users to install the game an unlimited number of times. However online activation remains mandatory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/53236 | title = 2K Games Lifts BioShock PC Install Limit, DRM | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Aaron | last=  Linde | date = [[2008-06-19]] | accessdate = 2008-06-19}}</ref>  The deactivation of the system was promised by Ken Levine in August, 2007, after retail sales of the PC version of the game were no longer an issue.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/48641 | title = BioScandal Dwindles: Levine Promises Eventual Removal of DRM, Ends Betrayaltongate 07 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Chris | last = Faylor | date= [[2007-08-24]] | accessdate= 2008-06-19}}</ref>

Alerts from [[virus scanner]]s and [[malware]] detectors, which can be triggered by SecuROM software, led to some debate about whether a [[rootkit]] was being installed; this was denied by 2K Games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/pc_faq.html | title = The Cult of Rapture FAQ | date = [[2007-08-23]] | accessdate = 2007-08-23 | publisher = Cult of Rapture | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamingbob.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=300| title = ''BioShock'' Demo Installs SecuROM Service | date = [[2007-08-23]] | accessdate = 2007-08-25 | publisher = GamingBOB.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070826-clearing-the-air-bioshock-does-not-contain-a-rootkit.html | title = Clearing the air: ''Bioshock'' does not contain a rootkit | publisher = Ars Technica | first = Ken | last = Fisher | date = [[2007-08-26]] | accessdate = 2007-08-26}}</ref> However, an uninstallation of ''BioShock'' does not remove the files installed by SecuROM or the registry keys used, and some of these files are impossible to delete in a conventional way.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=41921 | title = Avoid ''Bioshock'' like the plague | date = [[2007-08-25]] | accessdate = 2007-08-25 | publisher = The Inquirer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamingbob.com/2007/08/23/bioshock-installs-rootkit-including-demo/ | title = ''BioShock'' Demo Installs SecuROM Service | date = [[2007-08-25]] | accessdate=2007-08-25 |publisher = GamingBOB.com}}</ref>

''BioShock'' was also criticized for not supporting [[pixel shader]] 2.0b video cards (such as the [[Radeon]] [[Radeon R420|X800]]/[[Radeon R420|X850]]), which were considered high-end graphics cards in 2004<U+2013>2005, and accounted for about 24% of surveyed hardware collected through [[Valve Corporation|Valve's]] Steam platform at the time of ''BioShock'''s release. User efforts to create a pixel shader 2.0-compatible version of the software have met with some success,<ref name="shadershock">{{cite_web| url=http://www.paolofranchini.com/shshock/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=5| title=ShaderShock: Project Summary| accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> but 2K Games has issued no statements regarding possible pixel shader 2.0 support being added by an official patch.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/journals/hardware.ars/2007/08/23/no-bioshock-rapture-in-sight-for-ati-x800x850-users | title = No ''Bioshock'' Rapture in sight for ATI X800/X850 users | date = [[2007-08-23]] | accessdate = 2007-09-26 | publisher = Ars Technica | last = Hruska | first = Joel }}</ref>

==Versions and merchandise==
===Limited Collector<U+2019>s edition===
Following the creation of a fan petition for a special edition, Take-Two stated that they would publish a special edition of ''BioShock'' only if the petition received 5,000 signatures;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/articles.html | title = Will There Be a Limited Collector's Edition? | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey | date = [[2007-03-27]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher = Cult of Rapture}}</ref> this number of signatures was reached after just five hours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/articles.html | title = There Will Be A Limited Collector's Edition! | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey | date = [[2007-03-28]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher = Cult of Rapture}}</ref> Subsequently, a poll was posted on the Cult of Rapture community website (operated by 2K Games) in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to see in a special edition; the company stated that developers would take this poll into serious consideration.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/coverartcontest.html | title = Design the BioShock Limited Edition Box | first = Elizabeth | last = Tobey | date = [[2007-04-18]] | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | publisher = Cult of Rapture}}</ref>  To determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K games ran a contest, with the winning entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's Owner and Graphic Designer Adam Meyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/coverartcontestwinners.html|title=The ''BioShock'' Cover Art Contest Winners|accessdate=2007-10-20|date =[[2007-05-28]]|publisher=Cult of Rapture}}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
{{mainarticle|BioShock Original Soundtrack}}

2K Games released an orchestral score soundtrack on their official homepage on August 24, 2007. Available in [[MP3]] format, the score&mdash;composed by [[Garry Schyman]]&mdash;contains 12 of the 22 tracks from the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/home.html Cult of Rapture | title = Introducing the BioShock Orchestral Score | publisher = [[2K Games]]| accessdate = 2007-11-04 | date = [[2007-08-24]] | first = Elizabeth | last=  Tobey}}</ref> The Limited Edition version of the game came with the ''The Rapture EP'' remixes by [[Moby]] and Oscar The Punk.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/gaming/its-free/a-bioshockep-with-period-remixes-290859.php | title = Limited Edition Rapture EP | publisher = [[Kotaku]]|dateformat=dmy|accessdate=2 November 2007 | date = [[2007-08-17]] | first = Luke | last = Plunkett}}</ref> The three remixed tracks on the CD include "Beyond the Sea," "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]" and "Wild Little Sisters"; the original recordings of these songs are in the game.

In ''BioShock'', the player encounters [[phonograph]]s that play music from the 1940s and 1950s as background music. In total, 30 licensed songs can be heard throughout the game.<ref name="Hyrb">{{cite web | url = http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/10/11/bioshock-music-list.aspx | title = ''BioShock'' Music list | date = [[2007-10-11]] | accessdate = 2007-10-12 | publisher = Major Nelson's Blog | first = Larry | last = Hyrb }}</ref>

===Film===
Industry rumors after the game's release suggested a film adaptation of the game would be made, utilizing similar [[green screen]] filming techniques as in the movie ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' to recreate the environments of Rapture.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/01/08/rumor-bioshock-movie-murmurs-in-hollywood/ | title =Rumor: BioShock movie murmurs in Hollywood | publisher = Joystiq | first = Ludwig | last = Keitzmann | date = [[2008-01-08]] | accessdate = 2008-01-10 }}</ref>  On May 9, 2008, Take Two announced a deal with [[Universal Studios]] to produce a ''BioShock'' movie, to be directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] (''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'') and written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] (''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]], [[The Aviator]], [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'').
