'''HNLMS Koning der Nederlanden''' (Dutch: ''Zr.Ms. Koning der Nederlanden'') was an iron-hulled  ''ramtorenschip''<ref name=k1879a/> ([[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[turret ship]]) built by the ''[[Rijkswerf (Amsterdam)|Rijkswerf]]'' at Amsterdam for the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] in the early 1870s. She was the largest ship to serve in the Dutch Navy during the 19th century. The ship was converted to a [[barracks ship]] in the late 1890s and stationed in [[Surabaya]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. ''Koning der Nederlanden'' was [[scuttling|scuttled]] in Surabaya on 2 March 1942, during the [[Battle of Java (1942)|Battle of Java]], to prevent her capture by the Japanese.

==Design and description==
[[HNLMS]] ''Koning der Nederlanden'' was the largest ship built for the Dutch Navy during the 19th century.<ref name=d01/> She was fitted with a [[Naval ram|ram]] that protruded {{convert|1.22|m|ftin|sp=us}} from the bow. The ship's [[gun turret]]s were only {{convert|3.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} above the [[waterline]], but the [[freeboard]] could be increased by use of hinged [[wikt:bulwark|bulwarks]]. The turrets were rotated by [[hydraulic machinery]].<ref name=d01>Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, pp. 200<U+2013>201</ref>

The ship had an [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|268|ft|4|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|49|ft|10|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|19|ft|3|in|m}}. She displaced {{convert|5400|t|LT}}. Her crew consisted of 256 officers and men.<ref name=d01/>

===Propulsion===
''Koning der Nederlanden'' had two [[Marine steam engine#Compound|compound steam engines]], built by [[John Penn (engineer)|Penn and Sons]],<ref name=s0>Silverstone, p. 341</ref> each driving a single {{convert|4.876|m|1|adj=on|sp=us}} propeller. The engines were powered by seven [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s. The engines produced a total of {{convert|4630|ihp|lk=in}} which gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|11.95|kn|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s that began on 26 July 1877. She carried {{convert|620|LT|t}} of coal and had three funnels. The ship was [[barque]]-rigged with three masts and had a total sail area of {{convert|847|sqm|sp=us}}.<ref name=d1>Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, p. 201</ref>

===Armament===
The ship mounted a pair of [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] {{convert|11|in|adj=on|0}} [[rifled muzzle loader|rifled muzzle-loading guns]] in each gun turret. Each gun weighed {{convert|25.4|LT|t}}. Four {{convert|120|mm|1|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Krupp]] [[breech-loading gun]]s were mounted on the upper deck and six {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]] were also fitted in the ship's superstructure.<ref name=d0>Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, p. 200</ref> They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a range about {{convert|3500|yd|m}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46" (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweps.com}}</ref> The ship was initially armed with [[spar torpedo]]es, but they were removed shortly after completion.<ref name=d01/>

===Armor===
''Koning der Nederlanden'' had a complete waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|200|mm|1|sp=us}} thick amidships, but reduced to {{convert|150|mm|1|sp=us}} at the bow and stern. Each [[gun turret]], and its base, was protected by {{convert|230|mm|1|adj=on|sp=us}} armor plates, although the total thickness around the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] was {{convert|305|mm|0|sp=us}}. The deck was unarmored.<ref name=d1/>

==Service==
''Koning der Nederlanden'' was laid down at the ''Rijkswerf''<ref name=k1879a/> in Amsterdam on 31 December 1871. She was launched on 20 October 1874 and commissioned on 16 February 1877.<ref name=d01/> The ship was designed by [[Bruno Tideman|B.J.

The ship arrived in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] from the Netherlands in June 1978 and was repaired at Surabaya from August until November that year.<ref name=k1879>Koloniaal verslag van 1879, Bijlage C [5.2], p. 59</ref> At the end of the year she was stationed at ''Batavia''.<ref name=k1879a>Koloniaal verslag van 1879, Bijlage C [5.9], p. 5</ref> In May and June 1880 she made a trip to the Timor Archipelago to show the Dutch flag.<ref name=k1881>Koloniaal verslag van 1881, Bijlage C [5.8], p. 9</ref> From March till August 1881 ''Koning der Nederlanden'' was stationed at [[Cirebon]]. She was there to support measures taken by the civil government to counter the in- and export of cattle in the region. In late January 1882 she was again sent to Cirebon due to the outbreak of [[cholera]]. The ship was recalled after a few weeks and send to [[Riau]] for practice.<ref name=k1882>Koloniaal verslag van 1882, Bijlage C [5.9], p. 9</ref> In April and July 1883 she practiced respectively along the north coast of [[Java]] and the [[Sunda Strait]]. On 1 August she replaced ''Zeeland'' as  guard ship at Batavia. After an outbreak of cholera on board later that year the crew disinfected the ship in late September.<ref name=k1884>Koloniaal verslag van 1884, Bijlage C [5.8], p. 9</ref> ''Koning der Nederlanden'' was since December 1883 in Surabaya for repairs to her [[boiler]]s.

The 37-millimeter guns were replaced by two [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]], {{convert|75|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} guns and four 37-millimeter quick-firers by 1890. The ship decommissioned on 1 April 1895 and began her conversion to an accommodation and [[guard ship]] at Surabaya Dockyard in August 1896. She retained all four of her 120-millimeter and two of her 37-millimeter guns when she recommissioned on 1 December 1899.<ref name=d01/>
