'''San Juan Creek''', also called the '''San Juan River''',<ref name=gnis/> is a {{convert|29|mi|km|adj=on}} stream in [[Orange County, California]] that consists of a catchment basin encompassing {{convert|133.9|mi2|km2}}.<ref name=usgs>7.5 Minute Quadrangle Map, U.S. Geological Survey, San Juan Capistrano, 1968, photorevised 1981</ref><ref name=ocw>{{citeweb | url=http://www.ocwatersheds.com/watersheds/sanjuan.asp | title=Introduction to San Juan Creek Watershed|publisher=www.ocwatersheds.com|work=Watershed and Coastal Resources Division of Orange County}}</ref> Its [[mainstem (hydrology)|mainstem]] rises in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], in the Trabuco Ranger District of the [[Cleveland National Forest]]. From there it runs parallel to the [[California State Route 74|Ortega Highway]] as it winds west and south through San Juan Canyon, where it is joined by numerous small tributaries, and is joined by  [[Trabuco Creek|Trabuco]] and [[Oso Creek|Oso]] Creeks as it passes through [[San Juan Capistrano]]. It flows into the [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[Doheny State Beach]]. Once out of the foothills, San Juan Creek flows through the city of [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]] where groundwater flow direction generally is from the northeast to the southwest. Groundwater in this basin at the San Juan Capistrano reach is considered good.<ref name=em>Earth Metrics Incorporated, ''[[Phase I Environmental Site Assessment]] for Rancho San Juan Capistrano, bounded by San Juan Creek Road, Paseo Ranchero and Camino San Jose Road, [[San Juan Capistrano, California]]'', January 4, 1990</ref> Recent efforts of stream conservation have been in the planning stage including [[habitat]] conservation plan work.<ref name="usace1">[[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.

The watershed is split by two earthquake faults, which also separates its [[groundwater]]. San Juan Creek and its tributaries originally supported a wide range of animals and plants, but those have been negatively affected by human habitation. Historically, the San Juan Creek watershed can be considered as having three major stages of human habitation; these are the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] period, the [[Spain|Spanish]] occupation in the 1700s, and the modern era. The creek and its tributaries receive large amounts of [[urban runoff]] from an increasingly developed drainage basin, and are now considered polluted. Also, watercourses in the San Juan watershed have undergone a series of man-made modifications, including [[drop structure]]s and [[reservoir]]s.<ref name=usace>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocwatersheds.com/watersheds/pdfs/San_Juan_Creek_F5_Report_August_2002.pdf|title=San Juan Watershed Feasibility Study|publisher=www.ocwatersheds.com|work=[[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]|accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref>

[[Image:San Juan Canyon.JPG|thumb|left|The uppermost reaches of San Juan Creek are called San Juan Canyon and are followed by the narrow Ortega Highway.]]
San Juan Creek begins high in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] northwest of [[Lake Elsinore]], in a steep and narrow canyon known as [[San Juan Canyon]], at roughly {{convert|5100|ft|m}} in elevation. From there, it flows steeply downhill over riffles and waterfalls, and soon begins to parallel [[California State Route 74]], here known as the [[Ortega Highway]], as it winds through the rocky gorge. It drops over San Juan Falls, a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} cascade,<ref>Shaffer, p. 379-380</ref> then crosses under an [[arch bridge]] that carries the Ortega Highway.

==Geology==
The geology of the San Juan Creek watershed is complex, but can be described as having many [[Fault (geology)|seismic fault]] zones, with streams tending to follow these fault zones where canyons have formed, and having extremely erosive soils. The [[alluvial]] [[floodplain]] of San Juan Creek tends to have very deep concentrations in lower reaches and are said to be poorly drained. Soil types in the San Juan watershed can be divided into the ''Metz-San Emigdio'', ''Sorrento-Mocho'', ''Myford''. ''Alo-Bosanko'', ''Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper'', and ''Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer'' associations, in order from most level to steepest. These soil types are referred to as "SA#" by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], with numbers ranging from 3 to 8. "Sedimentary bedrock" composes many hillsides in the San Juan watershed, and poses a landslide danger during earthquakes, severe erosion or other events that may cause failure of hillside stability.<ref name=usace/><ref name=datatable/>

There are also several seismic faults within the watershed. These include a fault line (Cristianitos) running along [[Oso Creek]] northeast-southwest, passing offshore {{convert|7|mi|km}} south of the mouth of San Juan Creek, as well as another fault zone (Mission Viejo) that parallels the Cristianitos but ends far more south, in [[San Diego County]]. In summary, the San Juan watershed can be considered as being bisected by two faults, running through its approximate center. The first recorded earthquake in the area partially destroyed [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] in 1812, followed by others in 1862, 1933 and 1938.<ref name=usace/>

==Hydrology==
[[Groundwater]] in the San Juan Creek basin, also referred to as the "San Juan Creek Groundwater Basin", has a total volume of roughly {{convert|900000|acre feet|m3}}. (California State Water Resources Control Board, 1977.) Natural groundwater recharge in the San Juan basin is estimated to be roughly {{convert|160000|acre feet|m3}} per year historically, mostly from precipitation. This amount has been reduced due to extensive development of the lower segment of the watershed, which is continuing to reduce the amount of open ground that can potentially serve in groundwater recharge. Artificially sourced water from [[irrigation]] and other uses is responsible for recharging roughly {{convert|37500|acre feet|m3}} annually. The watershed is essentially split into half by the Christianitos and Mission Viejo fault zones, which result in the division of the "Upper" and "Lower" groundwater basins. The groundwater mostly lies in [[alluvium]], which ranges from a depth of {{convert|200|ft|m}} in the lower watershed to mostly none in the upper reaches of the watershed.<ref name=usace/>

<!-- [[Image:SanJuanCreekAtGanado.jpg|thumb|left|San Juan Creek during high flow in March 1958]] -->
[[Image:San Juan Creek in San Juan Capistrano.JPG|thumb|left|The final reaches of San Juan Creek are seen here in receding floodwaters.]]
Historically, the total surface and subsurface outflow from the San Juan basin into the Pacific was calculated at {{convert|5200|acre feet|m3}} annually. Increasing urban development, resulting in increased runoff from irrigation and other sources, brought the annual outflow to {{convert|7800|acre feet|m3}} as of 1993. The maximum annual yield is {{convert|9000|acre feet|m3}}. Although water from San Juan Creek, tributaries and basin groundwater are increasingly used for a limited amount of [[agricultural]] and [[municipal]] purposes, the annual yield from the watershed is continually increasing. As the groundwater recharge rate of the watershed is relatively high, it is safe to assume that groundwater levels will recover quickly from human use and human-induced pollution.<ref name=usace/>

Due to the lower amount of urbanization in the San Juan watershed as compared with other watersheds in the county, the [[100-year flood]] inundation risk is also significantly lower than that of most of the nearby watersheds. It has been calculated that a 100-year flood in the watershed would only affect a roughly {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide area for the lower reaches of San Juan Creek inside San Juan Capistrano, while for Trabuco Creek, only a {{convert|0.2|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide area would be affected, mainly due to severe downcutting. <ref name=100yearflood>Technical Background Report, General Plan Update - City of San Juan Capistrano, August 1999</ref> A fact of note is that the failure of the earthen Trampas Canyon Dam (on [[Trampas Canyon]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} upstream of San Juan Capistrano) would actually create a floodwave slightly larger than that of the 100 year flood that would race down San Juan Creek to its mouth.<ref name=100yearflood/> However, many levees in the San Juan area are still inadequately suited to a 100 year flood, regardless of the extent.<ref name=usace/>

==Watershed==
The [[Santa Ana Mountains]] occupy most of the north, east and south parts of the approximately {{convert|133.9|mi2|km2|adj=on}} San Juan Creek watershed, while the [[San Joaquin Hills]] and one of their small subranges border the watershed on the southwest, east, and northwest. The three major tributaries, San Juan, Trabuco and Bell Creeks, all originate in the Santa Ana Mountains. There are four main alluvial river valleys in the watershed, drained by San Juan, Trabuco, Oso and Bell Creeks. The San Juan Creek valley occupies the south portion of the watershed, running roughly south before spreading wider near the coast, and running northeast until it turns sharply to the southeast to meet the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the city of [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]]. The Trabuco Creek valley runs west from the northeasternmost portion of the watershed, then gradually becomes wider in a section called the ''Plano Trabuco'' then it joins the smaller, urbanized valley of Oso Creek, which runs primarily south. The combined valley then runs southward to merge with the San Juan Creek valley in [[San Juan Capistrano]]. The Bell Creek valley is narrower, beginning a few miles south of [[Trabuco Canyon, California]], and running in an almost perfectly straight southward course to San Juan Creek, which at this point is shortly out of the uppermost reach of its watershed, [[San Juan Canyon]]. There are 19 other major creeks in the watershed, including [[Tijeras Canyon Creek]] and [[El Horno Creek]], both of which drain parts of the [[foothills]] of the Santa Ana Mountains.<ref name=study/><ref name=hydrounit>{{cite web|url=http://wrpinfo.scc.ca.gov/watersheds/briefs/sanjuan/index.html|title=San Juan Hydrologic Unit  Profile|publisher=wrpinfo.scc.ca.gov|work=California Coastal Conservancy|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref>

San Juan Creek is considered as part of the {{convert|500|mi2|km2|adj=on}} San Juan Hydrologic Unit, which is a coastal region running from central-south Orange County to the north extent of [[San Diego County]], which borders Orange County on the south. The hydrologic unit also covers the watersheds of the watersheds of [[Aliso Creek (Orange County)|Aliso Creek]], [[Salt Creek (Orange County)|Salt Creek]], [[Prima Deshecha Ca<U+00F1>ada]], [[Segunda Deshecha Ca<U+00F1>ada]], and [[San Mateo Creek (Southern California)|San Mateo Creek]], in order from north to south. Elevation above sea level ranges from {{convert|0|to|5700|ft|m}}, and precipitation in the hydrologic unit ranges from {{convert|12|to|16|in|mm}} annually. Except for San Mateo Creek, all of the other streams in the unit have a relatively developed watershed. San Juan Creek receives extra runoff from agriculture, urban activities, commercial irrigation, and other human-induced sources, which creates an extra unnatural flow (consisting of [[urban runoff]] and agricultural return flows).<ref name=hydrounit/> This runoff is often polluted by trash, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, and [[oil]] received while running over pavement, and [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]] if draining farmland. A specific point of concern in the watershed is [[Oso Creek]]. A Southern California environmentalist, Michael Hazzard, said after diving into Upper Oso Creek Reservoir to retrieve an [[outboard motor]]:

{{quote|I spent three days diving to retrieve an outboard motor and my skin broke out in hives and boils and my gallbladder suffered and I later had six operations over a 2 1/2-year period.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reyes|first=David|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/04/local/me-hazzard4|title=He Puts Clean Water First|publisher=articles.latimes.com|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=4 January 2004|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref>''}}

===Wildlife===
{{main|Wildlife of San Juan Creek}}
San Juan Creek was originally rich in riparian and other habitats in both its upper and lower watershed, with [[wetland]]s totaling over {{convert|300|acre|km2}} historically in the lower reaches, before the rapid population explosion of Orange County began. There are 16 major vegetation zones in the watershed. Currently, the total wetland acreage in the watershed is {{convert|3|acre|km2}}, or one percent of the historic total.<ref name=datatable/> In 1987, just five bird species were confirmed in the watershed, while for [[fish]], [[benthic]] [[invertebrate]]s, and certain [[insect]]s there were no confirmed observations, in part due to insufficient site coverage. [[Steelhead trout]] have recently been observed in the creek and its tributary, Trabuco Creek.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weikel|first=Dan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/24/local/me-steelhead24?pg=1|title=Endangered Steelhead Trout Likely Making A Comeback In O.C.

===Streamflow===
The [[USGS]] operated two [[stream gauge]]s on San Juan Creek in the city of [[San Juan Capistrano]], one from 1929 to 1969 and the second from 1970 to 1984. For the former gauge, the highest recorded peak flow during that period was {{convert|22400|cuft/s|m3/s}} per second on 25 February 1969, with a gauge height of {{convert|5.6|ft|m}}. The second highest peak flow during that period was {{convert|13000|cuft/s|m3/s}} on 2 March 1938, presumably at the peak of the [[Los Angeles Flood of 1938]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/peak?site_no=11046500&agency_cd=USGS&format=html|title=San Juan Creek (near San Juan Capistrano)|publisher=National Water Information System|work=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=1929-1969|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> For the more recent stream gauge, the highest recorded flow was {{convert|14700|cuft/s|m3/s}} on 4 March 1978, gauge height {{convert|17|ft|m}}.<!-- Assuming that USGS made a mistake in the data, because the other flows in excess of 10,000 second feet all have a gauge height exceeding 10 feet. --> The second highest flow was {{convert|11700|cuft/s|m3/s}} on 20 February 1980, gauge height {{convert|15.43|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/peak/?site_no=11046550&amp|title=San Juan Creek (at San Juan Capistrano)|work=[[United States Geological Survey]]|publisher=National Water Information System|date=1970-1984|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> The highest flow recorded on San Juan Creek of all time, however, was not by a USGS stream gauge; the flow of {{convert|33650|cuft/s|m3/s}} was recorded on 11 January 2005.<ref name=agenda>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanjuancapistrano.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid= 9052|title=Agenda Item|publisher=www.sanjuancapistrano.org|work=County of Orange, Resources Development and Management Department|date=13 May 2008|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
Before the 1700s, San Juan Creek and its tributary, Trabuco Creek, were probably unnamed, although it is likely that the creeks had indigenous names that were later lost. The land in the San Juan watershed was mostly [[Juaneno|Acjachemen Indian]] territory, which extended from [[Aliso Creek (Orange County)|Aliso Creek]] in the north to [[San Mateo Creek (Southern California)|San Mateo Creek]] in the south, a distance of roughly {{convert|35|mi|km}} north-south. Most of the population centered around the outfalls of the two large perennial streams in the area, San Juan and San Mateo Creeks, as well as Trabuco Creek.<ref name=juaneno>{{cite web|url=http://sanofoundation.org/site/heritage/native-american-history|title=Native American History (Jua<U+00F1>eno)|publisher=sanofoundation.org|work=The San Onofre Foundation|accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref>

Such inhabitants, who numbered roughly two thousand overall, were hunter-gatherers, living in small, semi-permanent villages beside or near perennial streams. Their diet usually consisted of fruits, acorns, and grains, and sometimes meat, while they practiced little agriculture. Shell [[midden]]s indicate that they also harvested [[shellfish]] from the coast. Although natural disasters such as floods, drought, and wildfires occurred during that time, as they do today, the Jua<U+00F1>eno did not affect the environment of the area in either a negative or positive way. No permanent structures were built in the San Juan watershed until the arrival of the Spanish.<ref name=usace/>

===Spanish arrival===
In 1776, [[Father Junipero Serra]] founded [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] on a site that was most probably close to the creek, and as a result, the creek takes its name from the mission. The first site, however, was abandoned due to lack of water,<ref name=sjcmission>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjchistoricalsociety.com/missionsjc.html|title=Mission San Juan Capistrano|publisher=sjchistoricalsociety.com|work=The San Juan Capistrano Historical Society|accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> although the creek was known in historical accounts to be [[perennial]].<ref name=datatable/> The mission was moved to a second site, where it now stands. The Acjachemen were dubbed the "Jua<U+00F1>eno" by the Spanish, after the mission. The Spanish were among the first to create hydrological changes in the San Juan watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams.<ref name=usace/> Grazing animals, including [[cow]]s, [[sheep]] and other livestock, began their prevalence during this period, destroying many native grasses and leaving the ecosystem unbalanced and prone to erosion. 

<!-- [[Image:Trabuco Creek.jpg|thumb|right|San Juan Creek meets Trabuco Creek, c.&nbsp;1959. The creeks are still mostly in their natural state, similar to the state before the Spanish arrival. The highway is [[Interstate 5]]. San Juan Creek is the large channelized stream in the right and Trabuco Creek is the vegetation-choked channel on the left.]] -->
The origin of the name of Trabuco Creek ''(Spanish: "Blunderbuss Firearm Creek", literally)'' stems from the [[Gaspar de Portola]] expedition of 1769, during which a soldier lost a [[blunderbuss]] ("trabuco"), and the name became associated with the creek after that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trabucocanyon.org/history.html|title=Trabuco Canyon History|publisher=www.trabucocanyon.org|work=Trabuco Canyon, CA|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orangecounty.net/cities/Trabuco.html|title=Trabuco Canyon, California|publisher=www.orangecounty.net|work=Orange County City Guide|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> The origin of the name of Oso Creek ''(Spanish: "Bear Creek")'' is not known. Many of the creeks in the watershed have names of Spanish origin, which were most likely named by the Spanish conquistadors a long time before the area was annexed by the [[United States]].

In 1812, a heavy earthquake severely damaged many of the structures built by the Spanish. The Great Stone Church at Mission San Juan Capistrano, which had been built only six years before, collapsed; over forty people were reported to have been killed.<ref name=sjcmission/>

Before urban development, the partially devastated lands caused by overgrazing during the Spanish period was still potentially capable of rebounding to their natural state. 
In 1964, the urban percentage was 3, while by 1988, it had increased to 18 percent. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urban, and the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.<ref name=usace/> Many areas in the watershed now have no chance to revert back to their natural state as long as human habitation continues.

<!-- [[Image:DanaPointHarbor.jpg|thumb|left|Dana Point Harbor under construction, late 1950s]] -->
In the late 1960s, the construction of [[Dana Point Harbor]] began very near the mouth of San Juan Creek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeguys.com/UGlossary/DPhistory.html|title=History of Dana Point|publisher=www.bridgeguys.com|accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> This harbor prevented the occurrence of a large [[surf break]] phenomenon, colloquially known as "[[Killer Dana]]", in the bay. With the disappearance of Killer Dana, water circulation in the bay decreased. Resultantly, as pollution from San Juan Creek continued to flow freely into the bay, it stayed there for a longer period of time in comparison with that if the harbor had never been built. The pollution problems are ongoing, posing problems at Doheny Beach, where the 850,000&nbsp;annual visitors are threatened by the continuing pollution from San Juan Creek.<ref name=pollutedbeaches>{{cite web|url=http://dailybruin.ucla.edu/stories/2009/may/26/la-county-beaches-most-polluted-state/|title=LA County beaches most polluted in state|work=The Daily Bruin|publisher=dailybruin.ucla.edu|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref>

[[Image:TrabucoFalls.JPG|thumb|right|The "waterfall" on Trabuco Creek as it is today]]
During floods in the 1990s, an almost sheer {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} [[waterfall]] was rapidly scoured out of a steep earthen slope on Trabuco Creek, downstream of a railroad bridge and upstream of the Oso Creek confluence. This drop required quick reinforcement with [[grout]]ed [[riprap]], and still exists, with an average gradient of 29 percent before sheerly plunging into a murky [[stream pool]]. It still poses a major barrier to migrating fish and other riverine organisms, and thus isolates the lower few miles of Trabuco Creek from the relatively natural upper course.<ref name=drops>{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.org/atf/cf/%7BED0023C4-EA23-4396-9371-8509DC5B4953%7D/Section_2-Stakeholder_Outreach.pdf|title=Stakeholder Outreach|publisher=www.tu.org|work=Trout Unlimited - San Juan and Trabuco Creeks Steelhead Recovery Watershed Management Plan|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>

In 1996, severe floods caused by heavy rainstorms in the San Juan watershed caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long sections of concrete lining near their confluence. The damage was chiefly caused by severe basal [[erosion]], which led to subsequent failure of the concrete walls and levees. Once the concrete was breached, the bare earth underlying it was exposed to erosion, threatening a nearby residential community, but the floods receded before any serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with [[grout]]ed [[riprap]], which can still be seen today.<ref name=agenda/><ref name=wmp/>

In early 2005, even more severe floods that also caused flooding along area streams such as [[San Diego Creek]] and [[Aliso Creek (Orange County)|Aliso Creek]] impacted the San Juan watershed, with an all-time highest flow of {{convert|33650|cuft/s|m3/s}} recorded on January 11. Although the floods did not exceed the San Juan Creek channel capacity of {{convert|58800|cuft/s|m3/s}}, the west levee of the channel inside San Juan Capistrano nearly failed.<ref name=agenda/>
Also in 2005, pumps were installed on Tick and Dove Creeks (tributaries of Bell Canyon, which flows into San Juan Creek) to remove urban runoff stemming from a {{convert|1100|acre|km2|adj=on}} residential community on a nearby ridge. The pumps remove excess flow and divert it to storage basins for later use as reclaimed irrigation water.<ref name=streambio/>

In May 2009, it was announced that [[levee]] repairs along San Juan Creek would close a popular bikeway for up to two years, with repairs finished later in 2013. This spurred protests from many area residents who are common users of the path.<ref name=bikeway>

==River modifications==
Although most streams in the San Juan watershed are less developed than those in the neighboring Aliso Creek and [[Salt Creek (Orange County)|Salt Creek]] watersheds, San Juan, Oso and Trabuco Creeks have undergone an extensive series of modifications designed to control floods, reduce excessive erosion, and provide [[reclaimed water]] for irrigation. A growing amount of [[urban runoff]] flows into the creek and its tributaries, adding to the excessive perennial flow referred to often as a "nuisance flow" or "dry season nuisance flow". Historically, only San Juan and Trabuco creeks were known to be perennial,<ref name=datatable>{{cite web|url=http://ceres.ca.gov/wetlands/geo_info/so_cal/san_juan_creek.html|title=San Juan Creek|publisher=ceres.ca.gov|work=California Resources Agency|date=2 December 1997|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> while most of the tributaries, except for spring-fed ones such as Holy Jim Creek, were ephemeral. Oso Creek was formerly ephemeral, but currently it can flow in excess of {{convert|100|cuft/s|m3/s}} in up to ten percent of an year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.laguna-niguel.ca.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=1022|title=Oso Creek/Hydrology |publisher=www.ci.laguna-niguel.ca.us|work=Laguna Niguel Amended Gateway Specific Plan |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>  Finally, the long series of human-made modifications to the creek have resulted in its mouth, [[Doheny State Beach]], placing tenth in the most polluted beaches of California.<ref name=pollutedbeaches/>

[[Image:Snow at Lake Mission Viejo 005.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Mission Viejo is an artificial lake formed by a dam across Oso Creek, used primarily for recreation.]]
San Juan Creek is channelized from immediately upstream of the Interstate 5 crossing, and remains that way for its entire length until its mouth. Trabuco Creek is relatively unchannelized, but is channelized for several hundred yards above its confluence with San Juan. In sharp contrast is Oso Creek, which is channelized along nearly its entire length, while Bell Canyon is free-flowing. Two large reservoirs, Upper Oso and [[Lake Mission Viejo]], are built on Oso Creek. While Lake Mission Viejo is primarily for recreation, the {{convert|115|acre|km2|adj=on}} Upper Oso Reservoir collects Oso Creek water and diverts it for irrigation use, while any low-flow spillage that occurs over its dam is collected at a small downstream dam that feeds a pipe that pumps it back to the reservoir; in this way the Upper Oso Reservoir can be considered as a [[pumped-storage]] operation, although it does not produce [[hydroelectricity]]. A notable aspect of the reservoir is that it was vital in providing water to extinguish a large [[wildfire]] in October 2002. The dam is rockfill, {{convert|800|ft|m}} long and {{convert|142|ft|m}} high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM623A_Upper_Oso_Reservoir_Dam_Mission_Viejo_CA|title=Upper Oso Reservoir Dam|publisher=www.waymarking.com|work=Water Dams on WayMarking.com|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref>

A number of [[check dam]]s exist on small upper tributaries of San Juan Creek, mostly inside the [[Cleveland National Forest]], as well as a small, abandoned [[gabion]] structure lower on San Juan Creek. The structure, which was formerly a small dam, is now out of operation, but its roughly {{convert|3|to|4|ft|m|adj=on}} drop still poses a problem for migrating [[steelhead trout]]. There are a few water diversion weirs that exist on San Juan tributary streams to divert water for irrigation, ranching and limited municipal uses, but due to limited flows and polluted water, the usefulness of these structures are limited.<ref name=drops/>

[[Image:GroutedSlopingBoulderDrop.JPG|thumb|right|Drop structure viewed during rainfall, near the San Juan-Trabuco confluence]]
A number of [[drop structure]]s, which are small dams used to control water velocity, exist on streams in the San Juan watershed, primarily also on Trabuco and Oso creeks. On Trabuco Creek, there are eight drop structures, mostly built of riprap. The largest are a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cascade immediately downstream of a [[Metrolink]] bridge and a concrete drop structure at the terminus of a [[culvert]] that crosses underneath [[Interstate 5]]; however, neither is inventoried by the Orange County Flood Control Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocflood.com/docs_maps_structures.asp?fac=L02|title=Channel Grade Control Structure Inventory: Trabuco Creek Channel|work=Orange County Flood Control Division|publisher=www.ocflood.com|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> There are also about seven drop structures on Oso Creek, most of which are also built of riprap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocflood.com/docs_maps_structures.asp?fac=L03|title=Channel Grade Control Structure Inventory: Oso Creek Channel|work=Orange County Flood Control Division|publisher=www.ocflood.com|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> The mainstem San Juan Creek does not have any notable drop structures, dams or water diversions.

As with channelization, [[levee]]s are only found in the lower San Juan watershed. San Juan Creek is bounded with levees from upstream of Interstate 5 to very near its mouth at Doheny Beach, while Trabuco Creek has levees from upstream of Del Obispo Street (a continuation of the [[Ortega Highway]]) downstream to its mouth at San Juan Creek. Oso Creek has some raised banks, but it is not certain if those are levees. Smaller tributaries, such as [[El Horno Creek]] and [[Bell Canyon]], do not have levees. Although the San Juan and Trabuco Creek levees are said to have a "fairly high level of protection currently",<ref name=usace/> failure scenarios of levees in the San Juan watershed have been extensively studied, and they have been determined to possibly fail for a variety of reasons, some of which have already been demonstrated in the floods of 1996 and 2005.<ref name=usace/><ref name=wmp/> In response to the danger of another flood, work has begun on a new west-bank levee replacement that will finish in 2013, blocking a popular San Juan Creek bicycle path for up to two years, despite protests from regular users of the path.<ref name=bikeway/>

==Stream crossings==
<!-- [[Image:SanJuanCanyonBridge.jpg|right|thumb|The arch bridge over San Juan Canyon, c.&nbsp;1930]] -->
This is a list of major crossings of San Juan Creek, proceeding upstream of the mouth. Notably, for the last stream crossing, the Ortega Highway crosses San Juan Creek on a {{convert|54.9|m|ft|adj=on}} long [[arch bridge]], which is said to be "basically intolerable requiring high priority of replacement", with a structural safety rating of 24.9 percent.<ref name=usace/><ref name=nbi>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbridges.com/|title=National Bridge Inventory|accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>
