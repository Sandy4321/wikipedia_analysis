'''Dynamite''' is an [[explosive material]] based on [[nitroglycerin]], initially using [[diatomaceous earth]] ([[American English|AE]]: kieselgur; [[British English|BE]]: kieselguhr), or another absorbent substance such as powdered shells, clay, sawdust, or wood pulp. Dynamites using organic materials such as sawdust are less stable and such use has been generally discontinued. Dynamite was invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in Kr<U+00FC>mmel (Geesthacht, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany), and [[patented]] in 1867. Its name is derived from [[Greek roots]] <U+03B4><U+03CD><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03B9><U+03C2> ''d<U+00FD>namis'' that literally mean "connected with power."

Dynamite is usually sold in the form of sticks about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|0}} long and about {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, with a weight of about {{convert|0.5|lb|kg|abbr=on|2}}.<ref name="Austin Blaster Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |title=Austin Powder Guide, Dynamite series page 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> Other sizes also exist. The maximum [[shelf life]] of nitroglycerin-based dynamite is recommended as one year from the date of manufacture under good storage conditions.<ref name="Austin Blaster Guide" />

Dynamite is a [[High explosives|high explosive]], which means it [[detonation|detonates]] rather than [[deflagration|deflagrates]]. While [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) is used as the [[TNT equivalent|standard for gauging explosive power]], dynamite has more than a [[Dynamite#Difference from TNT|60% greater energy density]] than TNT.

Another form of dynamite consists of nitroglycerin dissolved in [[nitrocellulose]] and a small amount of [[ketone]]. This form of dynamite is similar to [[cordite]], and is much safer than the simple mix of nitroglycerin and diatomaceous earth. '''Military dynamite''' achieves greater stability by avoiding the use of nitroglycerin and uses much more stable chemicals.<ref>{{citation |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&pg=PA498&lpg=PA498&dq=Military+dynamite+TNT|year=2007 |isbn=0-615-14794-1}}</ref> Public knowledge of dynamite led to [[metaphor]]ic uses, such as saying that a particular issue "is political dynamite" (for example at [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=8618 this link]).

==Uses==
Dynamite is mainly used in the [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[construction]], and [[demolition]] industries, and it has had some historical usage in warfare. However the unstable nature of nitroglycerin, especially if subjected to freezing, has rendered it obsolete for military uses.

==History==
[[Image:Nobel patent.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]]'s 1864 [[patent application]] for [[nitroglycerin]].]]
[[File:Nobels Extradynamit label.jpg|thumb|"Nobel's Extra Dynamite" manufactured by Nobel's old company, Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget.]]
Dynamite was invented by [[Alfred Nobel]] and was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than [[black powder]]. Nobel obtained [[patent]]s for his invention: in England on May 7, 1867 and in [[Sweden]] on October 19, 1867.<ref name=s&s-101>Sch<U+00FC>ck & Sohlman (1929), p. 101.</ref> He originally sold dynamite as ''"Nobel's Blasting Powder"''. After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[gunpowder]] and [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down. However, a few [[United States|American]] businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula.<ref name="USPat 234489">US Patent 234489 issued to Morse 16 November 1880</ref> The invention was celebrated by [[anarchism|anarchists]], who recognized its suitability for [[propaganda by the deed]].<ref>Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''</ref>

==Manufacture==
[[File:Explosives Magazine, Ladyha.JPG|left|upright|thumb|An old dynamite storage magazine at Ladyha' Colliery ruins, Ayrshire, Scotland.]]
[[File:Diatomaceous Earth BrightField.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Diatomaceous earth]] as viewed under [[Bright field microscopy|bright field]] [[lighting|illumination]] on a [[light microscope]]. Diatomaceous earth is a soft, [[siliceous]], [[sedimentary rock]] made up of the [[cell walls]]/[[exoskeleton|shells]] of single cell [[diatoms]] and which readily crumbles to a fine powder. It is also very absorbent. This image of diatomaceous earth particles in [[water]] is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/[[micrometer]], the entire image covers a region of approximately 1.13 by 0.69 millimeter.]]
Classic dynamite consists of three parts [[nitroglycerin]], one part diatomaceous earth and a small admixture of [[sodium carbonate]]. This mixture is formed into short sticks and wrapped in paper. Nitroglycerin by itself is a very strong explosive, and in its pure form it is extremely shock-sensitive (that is, physical shock can cause it to explode), and degrades over time to even more unstable forms. This makes it highly dangerous to transport or use in its pure form. Absorbed into diatomaceous earth or more commonly sawdust, nitroglycerin is less shock-sensitive. Over time, the dynamite will "weep" or "sweat" its nitroglycerin, which can then pool in the bottom of the box or storage area. (For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over boxes of dynamite in storage.) Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks causing them to be even more shock, friction or temperature sensitive. This creates a very dangerous situation. While the actual possibility of explosion without a [[blasting cap]] is minimal, old dynamite is still dangerous.

===South Africa===
For several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Republic of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases [22 kilograms (50 pounds) each] annually. In addition, a rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.<ref>[http://www.caia.co.za/chsahs02.htm An MBendi Profile: South Africa - History of the Chemical Industry]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

One of the drawbacks of dynamite was that it was dangerous to manufacture. There were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were also several less notable but still newsworthy explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are far safer to manufacture and to handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=2006-06-30 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

===United States===
[[Image:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]
In the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented "ammonium dynamite", a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. These dynamites were marketed with the trade name "Extra". Ammonium nitrate contains 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin. Dynamite was manufactured by the [[E. I du Pont de Nemours Company]] until the mid-1970s. Other American dynamite makers of that time period included the [[Hercules, California|Hercules Corporation]], Atlas, Trojan-US Powder, Austin, and several other smaller firms. Dynamite has been mostly phased out in favor of [[water gel explosive]]s, which are cheaper to manufacture, and in many ways are safer to handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/related_topics/explosives.html |title=DuPont Heritage: Explosives |publisher=.dupont.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

==Difference from TNT==
It is a common [[misconception]] that [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and dynamite are the same thing, or that dynamite contains TNT. Though both substances are high explosives, there is little similarity between them. Dynamite is an absorbent mixture soaked in nitroglycerin then compacted into a cylindrical shape and wrapped in paper. TNT is a specific chemical compound called 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. ('''Military dynamite''' is a dynamite substitute, also formulated without nitroglycerin, containing 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch to be the equivalent of dynamite composed of 60% nitroglycerin, but much safer to store and handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>)

A stick of dynamite contains roughly 2.1 M[[joule|J]] of energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classroom-energy.org/energy_101/energy_quick_tour/quicktour_1.html |title=Classroom Energy |publisher=Classroom Energy |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> The energy density ([[joule]]s/[[kilogram]] or J/kg) of dynamite is approximately 7.5 MJ/kg, compared to 4.7 MJ/kg of TNT{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.
