It was directed by [[Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra]] (of ''[[Aks (film)|Aks]]'' fame) and stars [[Aamir Khan]], [[Soha Ali Khan]], [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]], [[Kunal Kapoor]], [[Siddharth Narayan]], [[Sharman Joshi]], [[Atul Kulkarni]], British actress [[Alice Patten]], [[Waheeda Rehman]], [[Om Puri]], [[Kiron Kher]] and [[Anupam Kher]]. The music is by [[A. R. Rahman]] and the album went on to become a chartbuster. The movie was well-received all over the globe. 

While the film was India's entry for the [[Golden Globe Awards]] and the [[Submissions for the 79th Academy Award for Best Foreign Film|Academy Awards]] in the ''Best Foreign Film Category,'' it did not make the shortlist for either ceremony. It was, however, nominated for "[[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film Not In The English Language]]" at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Awards]] in 2006, where it lost to [[Pan's Labyrinth]]. However, ''Rang De Basanti'' won the best movie award at the 2007 [[Filmfare Awards]].

==Synopsis==
Struggling [[United Kingdom|British]] [[film director|filmmaker]] Sue McKinley ([[Alice Patten]]) comes to [[India]] after reading the diary of her grandfather Mr. McKinley ([[Steven Mackintosh]]), who served in the [[British Empire]] during the [[Indian independence movement]]. She plans to make a short film about some of the unsung revolutionary heroes of this independence movement based on the written account of her grandfather. Her friend, Sonia ([[Soha Ali Khan]]) helps her find four young men to act in the film: Daljit a.k.a. DJ ([[Aamir Khan]]), Karan Singhania ([[Siddharth]]), Aslam ([[Kunal Kapoor]]) and Sukhi ([[Sharman Joshi]]).

They are not enthusiastic at the idea of acting in a film about the independence movement, but Sue wins them over. Laxman Pandey ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), a political party activist, later joins the group, although he is initially unpopular due to his [[Hindutva]] beliefs and contempt for Aslam, a [[Muslim]]. As these young men learn more about the history of the Independence movement during filmmaking, they lose their cynicism and start to consider what they can contribute to society. 

During such a time, Ajay Singh Rathod ([[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]]), Sonia's fianc<U+00E9> and a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in the [[Indian Air Force]], is killed when his plane crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Ajay was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends don't accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives, which would have been lost had he ejected from the aircraft safely, leaving the aircraft to crash in an overcrowded area. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt [[Defense minister]] ([[Mohan Agashe]]). Through Rajnath Singhania ([[Anupam Kher]]), Karan's father, he had signed a contract for cheap, spurious [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21]] aircraft spare parts in return for a personal favor.

Not content to accept this as "just the way things are done", the group and their supporters decide to protest peacefully at [[India Gate]], a [[war memorial]] in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. Police forcefully break up their protest and in the process, Rathod's mother ([[Waheeda Rehman]]) gets severely hurt. These young men decide that they must emulate the early [[freedom fighter]]s and resort to violence to achieve justice. They kill the defense minister to avenge Rathod's death. The minister is speculated to be killed by terrorists and instead, he is considered a martyr by the media. To bring forth the true story, the group decide to go public through a radio station. Before they do so, Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. 

DJ, Sukhi, Karan, Pandey and Aslam forcibly take over the [[All India Radio]] station premises. Karan goes on air and speaks out the truth about the defense minister and his wrong doings. While the world is listening to this, they are all killed in an ambush by the police and the commandos.

Rakeysh Mehra, an [[advertisement]] director, whose first film was ''[[Aks (film)|Aks]]'' (2001), came up with several ideas for his next venture. While one such story was about a group of youngsters, who worked in an automobile garage shop, the other was about the life of [[Bhagat Singh]], an [[India]]n freedom revolutionary.<ref name="Paintityellow_dropped">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-03-17|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060203/asp/etc/story_5760702.asp

This new story, which eventually formed the base for ''Rang De Basanti'''s script, spoke of a British documentary filmmaker, who on her visit to India, realizes that the youngsters are far more Western than her.<ref name="Paintityellow_dropped"/> He added that this story came from his upbringing, youth and experiences over the years.<ref name="rediff_pI">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-03-16|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/jan/12mehra.htm

When asked about the extent of time he took in coming up with the story, he said that for researching aspects of the story, it took him seven years inclusive of three years for writing it.<ref name="rediff_pI"/> The filming was intended to be done bilingually in English (as ''Paint it Yellow'') and [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref name="bilingual">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-03-17|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/626728.cms

Having appreciated the films produced by Angad Paul, son of Lord [[Swaraj Paul]], an [[India]]n-based, [[British people|British]]-born businessman, Mehra approached the former in his office.

Since the film's story was based on the graduated students from [[Delhi University]], who refuse to evolve from the comfort of their alma mater.

Coming to the technical department, Lovleen Bains and Arjun Bhasin were the key people in designing the look of the film.

He was referred to Mehra by Khan due to his previous association. After knowing from the script that it was about ex-students in their late twenties, Bhasin developed the actors' look accordingly. Though he was responsible for Khan's rebellious look, Sharman Joshi's (who played ''Sukhi'') lovable persona or Madhavan's dignified appearance, Bhasin credited Bains for her major contributions to the film.<ref name="costumes">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-03-21|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2006/feb/01sld1.htm
