'''Stearns County''' is a [[County (US)|county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], founded in 1855<ref>[http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hinfo/govseries/No34.htm Minnesota Government Series, State Symbols<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. As of 2006, the population was 144,096 (133,166 in 2000). Its [[county seat]] is [[Saint Cloud, Minnesota|Saint Cloud]]{{GR|6}}. It was named after [[Charles Thomas Stearns]], a local politician.

Stearns County is part of the [[Saint Cloud metropolitan area|Saint Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
The area that is currently defined as Stearns County was once occupied by several indigenous tribes, such as the Sioux ([[Sioux|Dakota]]), Chippewa ([[Ojibwe]]) and Winnebago ([[Ho-chunk]]). The first large immigration was of German Catholics in the 1850s. Early arrivals also came from eastern states. Originally, the county was to be named Stevens County to honor Governor Isaac Ingalls Stevens who conducted an area expedition in 1853. However, due to a clerical error, the county was named Stearns after Charles Thomas Stearns who was a member of the Territorial Council.  (Later, the area two counties west was named [[Stevens_County,_Minnesota|Stevens County]], to compensate for this clerical error.)
