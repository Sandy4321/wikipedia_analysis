The '''Red Line''' is a [[rapid transit]] line operated by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] running roughly north-south through [[Boston, Massachusetts]] into neighboring communities. The line begins at [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife station]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], west of Boston, near the intersection of [[Alewife Brook Parkway]] and [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]].  It passes through downtown Boston, with transfers to the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] at [[Park Street (MBTA station)|Park Street]], the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] at [[Downtown Crossing (MBTA station)|Downtown Crossing]], and the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] at [[South Station (MBTA subway station)|South Station]]. South of downtown, it splits at [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]], with  branches to [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]] and [[Ashmont (MBTA station)|Ashmont]], with the [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]] connecting to [[Mattapan (MBTA station)|Mattapan]].

[[MBTA#Fare Collection|Regular fare]] is $2.00 when using a [[CharlieCard]] or $2.50 using cash or a [[CharlieCard#CharlieCard and CharlieTicket details|Charlie Ticket]]. Exit fares on the Braintree extension were discontinued in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/charlie/?id=10132 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930014518/http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/charlie/?id=10132 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |title=Frequently Asked Questions on the Fare Restructuring and Increase |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

Approximate travel times to or from Park Street are: northbound to [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]], 11 minutes; Alewife, 20 minutes; southbound to JFK/UMass, 8 minutes; Ashmont, 17 minutes; Braintree, 28 minutes.<ref>[[Association for Public Transportation]], ''Car-Free in Boston, A Guide for Locals and Visitors'', 10th ed.

==History==
{{see also|History of the MBTA}}
[[File:Cambridge Bridge postcard.jpg|thumb|left|The new Cambridge (now [[Longfellow Bridge|Longfellow]]) Bridge pre-1912, from the Boston end, with the unfinished right-of-way down the center.]]

===Cambridge Tunnel===
The Red Line was the last of the four original Boston subway lines ([[Green Line (MBTA)|Green]], [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange]], [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]]) to begin construction. The section from [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]] and [[Eliot Yard]] to [[Park Street (MBTA station)|Park Street]] and the [[Tremont Street Subway]] opened on March 23, 1912. At Harvard, a [[prepayment station]] was provided for easy transfer to streetcar routes operating in a separate tunnel (now the [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]]). Opening of the line required construction of the '''Cambridge Tunnel''' beneath [[Massachusetts Avenue (Cambridge)|Massachusetts Avenue]] and [[Main Street (Cambridge)|Main Street]] from Harvard onto the (now historic) [[Longfellow Bridge]]. The line occupied a previously constructed rail right-of-way in the center of the bridge.  On the Boston side, the line briefly transformed into an [[Rapid transit|elevated railway]], rising over [[Charles Circle (Boston)|Charles Circle]] and into a tunnel through [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] to Park Street. 

===Dorchester Tunnel and Extension===
The '''Dorchester Tunnel''' to [[Downtown Crossing (MBTA station)|Washington Street]] and [[South Station Under]] opened on April 4, 1915 and December 3, 1916, with transfers to the [[Washington Street Tunnel (Boston)|Washington Street Tunnel]] and [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] respectively. Further extensions opened to [[Broadway (MBTA station)|Broadway]] on December 15, 1917 and [[Andrew (MBTA station)|Andrew]] on June 29, 1918, both [[prepayment station]]s for streetcar transfer. The Broadway station included an upper level with its own tunnel for streetcars, which was abandoned in 1919 due to most lines being truncated to Andrew. The upper level has since been incorporated into the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]].

Next came the '''Dorchester Extension''', now the '''Ashmont Branch''', following a [[Right-of-way (railroad)|rail right-of-way]] created in 1870 by the '''Shawmut Branch Railroad'''. In 1872, the right-of-way was acquired by the [[Old Colony Railroad]] to connect the main line at [[Harrison Square (Boston)|Harrison Square]] with the [[Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad]], running from the Old Colony at [[Neponset, Massachusetts|Neponset]], west to what is now [[Mattapan (MBTA station)|Mattapan station]]. The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] succeeded Old Colony in operating the branch and passenger service ceased in anticipation of the Boston Elevated Railway expansion on September 4, 1926,<ref>[http://world.nycsubway.org/us/boston/red.html End of service on Old Colony's Shawmut Branch]</ref>

The Boston Elevated opened the first phase of the Dorchester Extension, to [[Fields Corner (MBTA station)|Field's Corner station]] on November 5, 1927, south from [[Andrew (MBTA station)|Andrew]], then southeast to the surface, and along the west side of the Old Colony mainline in a depressed right-of-way. [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|Columbia]] and [[Savin Hill (MBTA station)|Savin Hill stations]] were built on the surface at the sites of former Old Colony stations. The remainder of the extension opened to [[Ashmont (MBTA station)|Ashmont]] and [[Codman Yard]] on September 1, 1928, and included [[Shawmut (MBTA station)|Shawmut station]] where there had been no Old Colony station due to its close proximity to Fields Corner. The first phase of the [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]] opened on August 26, 1929, using the rest of the Shawmut Branch right-of-way, including [[Cedar Grove (MBTA station)|Cedar Grove station]], and part of the old [[Dorchester and Milton Branch]].

===MBTA era and branding===
The color red was assigned on August 26, 1965 to what had been called the '''Cambridge-Dorchester Tunnel''' and marked on maps as route {{MBTABus|1}}. The color was chosen because the line then ended at [[Harvard University]], whose school color is [[crimson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquare.com/History/Glimpses/Transportation.aspx |title=Transportation History |publisher=Harvard Square Business Association |author=Kleespies, Gavin W. and MacDonald, Katie |accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref>

In 1968, letters were assigned to the south branches, "A" for Quincy (planned to extend to South Braintree) and "C" for Ashmont. "B" was probably reserved for a planned branch from Braintree to [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]]. As new [[rollsign]]s were made, this lettering was phased out. In 1994, new electronic signs included a different labeling, "A" for Ashmont, "B" for Braintree and "C" for Alewife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups-beta.google.com/group/misc.transport.urban-transit/browse_frm/thread/a39e96e4ecc836ca/a9a23545f09a35c6 |title=misc.transport.urban-transit &#124; Google Groups |work=Groups-beta.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref>

===South Shore Line===
The first section of the '''South Shore Line''' opened on September 1, 1971, branching from the original Red Line at a [[flying junction]] north of Columbia (now [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]]).  It ran along the west side of the Old Colony rail right-of-way (which has since been reduced to one track), crossing to the east side north of Savin Hill. The northernmost station was [[North Quincy (MBTA station)|North Quincy]], with others at [[Wollaston (MBTA station)|Wollaston]] and [[Quincy Center (MBTA station)|Quincy Center]]. Beyond Quincy Center, the '''Braintree Extension''' runs southward to [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]], opened March 22, 1980, via an intermediate stop at [[Quincy Adams (MBTA station)|Quincy Adams]] which opened on September 10, 1983.  The Extension had been first planned by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]], published in 1969.

===Northwest Extension===
[[File:Alewife hatches.JPG|thumb|right|Subway hatches for planned extension to Lexington]]

The first part of the '''Northwest Extension''', the relocation of [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]] station, was finished on September 6, 1983. During construction, several temporary stations were built at Harvard Square. Eliot Yard was demolished: Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]] now sits inside its retaining walls. Extensions to [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter]] and  [[Davis (MBTA station)|Davis]] on December 8, 1984, and to [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]] on March 30, 1985 brought the line to its current terminus. During the expansion, the MBTA pioneered an investment in the "[[Arts on the Line]]" [[public art]] program. 

This extension had been scaled back from an original plan to extend the line from Harvard Square to Route 128 in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] via the former B&M/MBTA Bedford Branch railroad right-of-way.  That plan had been supported by the Town of Lexington, but was scuttled by fierce anti-urban sentiment in parts of [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]]. The right-of-way on which the extension would have been built was developed into the [[Minuteman Bikeway]]. 

===Recent history===
[[File:Old and new at Central Square station.JPG|thumb|right|Old and new construction at Central]]
Platforms on older stations were lengthened mostly in the 1980s to allow six-car trains, which first ran January 21, 1988.<ref name=changes /> (The Northwest Extension and the South Shore Line were built with 6-car platforms). JFK/UMass (then called Columbia) was the first to be modified in 1970, followed by Ashmont and Shawmut in 1981. Between 1984 and 1987, the remaining stations on the original Cambridge-Dorchester Line were rebuilt or modified.<ref name=changes /> In stations like Central and Downtown Crossing, the renovation is apparent where the new architecture is different from the old.

A second Red Line platform opened at [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]] on December 14, 1988, allowing Braintree Branch trains to stop at the station. Since then, the configuration of the line has remained essentially static. In January 2012, the state's Central Transportation Planning staff released a conceptual plan for widening the [[Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)|Southeast Expressway]], which would involve completely rearranging JFK/UMass station. The Red Line would be reduced to two tracks sharing a single platform, similar to the arrangements at [[Andrew (MBTA station)|Andrew]], and the junction between the Ashmont and Braintree branches would be streamlined and moved just south of the station. This would allow for a second commuter rail track through the station, allowing more trains to stop and eliminating a major bottleneck for the Old Colony Lines and the Greenbush Line.<ref name=jan2012plan>{{cite web |url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/119128/ocn785407701.pdf |title=Improving the Southwest Expressway: A Conceptual Plan |author=Central Transportation Planning Staff |publisher=Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization |date=January 2012 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}</ref>

===Longfellow Bridge rehabilitation project===
A $255 million project starting construction in Spring 2013 will replace structural elements of the [[Longfellow Bridge]], which carries the line across the Charles River between the [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]] and [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall/MIT]] stations.  The project will require at least 25 weekend shutdowns including temporary relocation of the tracks (substitute bus shuttle service will be provided). All outbound roadway traffic will be detoured from the bridge for the three years of construction.  The rebuilt bridge will have widened sidewalks and bike lanes.<ref name=Powers>{{cite news|last=Powers|first=Martine|title=Longfellow Bridge repairs, disruption to start in summer|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/02/28/longfellow-bridge-construction-begin-this-summer-with-major-traffic-diversions/gPqPYiWt2KmmWpxB5vmOaM/story.html|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name=MassDOT>{{cite web|last=MassDOT|title=Longfellow Bridge|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/charlesriverbridges/LongfellowBridge.aspx|work=Accelerated Bridge Program|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref>

== Operations and signaling ==
The line used [[Train stop|trip-stop wayside signaling]] for the Ashmont and Harvard branches until the mid-1980s, while the Braintree Branch was one of the earliest examples of [[Automatic Train Control]] (ATC). The Alewife Branch was built with ATC, at which point the remainder of the line was upgraded to ATC as well. The line was under local control at towers until 1985 when an electromechanical panel was completed at 45 High St. This was replaced in the late 1990s with a software-controlled Automatic Train Supervision, using a product by [[Union Switch & Signal]], subcontracted to Syseca Inc. (now ARINC), at a new theater at 45 High St. Subsequent revisions to the system were made internally at the MBTA.

The shortest scheduled [[headway]] run on the line was most likely the {{frac|1|3|4}} minute interval in the schedule published in 1928. Ridership peaked around 1947, when passenger counters logged over 850 people per four-car train during peak periods. The newer ATC signaling was designed to higher safety standards, but the block layout in the downtown area reduced the capacity by 50% over the previous wayside signaling system. The net loss of capacity measured in cars per hour has not been rectified, although at the same time the platforms were lengthened to run six-car trains, which are now operated on a longer headway. The shifting between speed codes that is inherent in an ATC system near capacity caused peak period energy consumption to skyrocket, and accelerated the decline of the 01400 series fleet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

During snowstorms, the MBTA runs an empty train during non-service hours to keep the tracks and third rail clear.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/boston/downtown/gallery/mbta_red_line_turns_100?pg=35 |title=MBTA Red Line's 100th anniversary |author=Ba Tran, Andrew |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

==Accessibility==
{{See also|MBTA accessibility}}
All stations are [[wheelchair accessible]] except [[Wollaston (MBTA station)|Wollaston]] on the Braintree branch and [[Valley Road (MBTA station)|Valley Road]] on the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line.

==Equipment==
The line is [[standard gauge]] [[heavy rail]], excepting the Mattapan Line, which runs trolleys. Trains consist of mated pairs of [[Multiple unit|electric multiple unit]] cars powered from a [[List of current systems for electric rail traction|600 VDC]] [[third rail]]. All trains run in six-car sets.

Rolling stock is stabled and maintained at the [[Cabot Yard]] near [[Broadway (MBTA station)|Broadway]] in [[South Boston]]. The connection to this yard is at the junction where the two branches split, near [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]]. Trains are also stabled overnight at Braintree (Caddigan Yard) and Ashmont (Codman Yard), and at the stub tracks west of Alewife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/boston/red.html |title=MBTA Red Line |publisher=nycsubway.org |author=O'Regan, Gerry |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> Eliot Yard, on the surface near [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]], served East Boston Tunnel (now [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]) cars for a short time and Red Line cars until it was demolished in the 1970s. (East Boston Tunnel cars accessed the yard through the now-closed Joy Street portal near [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin]] and a track connection on the [[Longfellow Bridge]]).

===1912 Cambridge Subway Cars===
The Cambridge Subway began service in 1912 with 40&nbsp;all-steel motor cars built by the [[Standard Steel Car Company]]. They had a novel design as a result of studies about Boston<U+2018>s existing lines, with a then-extraordinary length of 69&nbsp;ft. 2<U+00BD>&nbsp;in. over buffers and large standee capacity, weighing only 85,900&nbsp;lb. and with an all-new door arrangement: three single sliding doors per side evenly distributed along the car<U+2018>s length so that the maximum distance to a door was around 9&nbsp;ft. The idea was later taken over by the [[Brooklyn<U+2013>Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]] Standards and Philadelphia<U+2018>s [[Market<U+2013>Frankford Line|Frankford Elevated Line]] cars. About 20&nbsp;ft of the car was separated by a bulkhead for a smoking compartment. In contrast to the elevated lines, passenger flowthrough was not intended, and every door was used as both entrance and exit.<ref>''Steel Cars for the Cambridge Subway'' In: Electric Railway Journal, Vol&nbsp;XXXIX, No.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;58.</ref>

===Aluminum-bodied cars===
Three series of older [[aluminum]]-bodied cars were built: the 1500 and 1600 series by [[Pullman-Standard]] 1969<U+2013>1970, and 1700-57 by [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation|UTDC]] in 1988. These cars seat 62 to 64 each, and approximately 132 cars are in active service. All cars are painted white with red trim, with manually operated exterior [[roll sign]]s. Before their overhauls, the 1500 and 1600 series had a brushed aluminum livery with a thin red stripe, and were usually called "Silverbird" cars from their natural metal finish.

All these cars use traditional [[Direct current|DC]] [[traction motor]]s with [[electromechanical]] controls manufactured by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]], and can interoperate. The 1500 and 1700 series cars could operate as singletons, but in practice are always operated as mated pairs. The 1600 series could only operate as married pairs. Originally, the 1500s were double-ended and had two cabs, but were converted to single ended during their midlife overhaul.<ref>http://www.trolleymuseum.org/documents/fundraiser-EastBoston4.pdf</ref>  Headlights are still present on the non-cab ends on the 1500s. The 1700s also have headlights on their non-cab end, but they were built with only one cab.

===Stainless steel-bodied cars===
The 1800-85 series of [[stainless steel]]<U+2013>bodied cars was built in 1993<U+2013>1994 by [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] from components manufactured in [[Canada]] and assembled in [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, Vermont]]. These cars seat 50, and 86 cars are in active service. An automated stop announcement system provides station announcements synchronized with visual announcements in red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] signs ceiling-mounted in each car. These cars are stainless steel with red trim, and use yellow [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] exterior signs. These cars originally had red cloth seats (in contrast to the black leather seats of other cars), but in the early 21st century the cloth seats were replaced with black leather seats. More recently the black leather seats were replaced with vandalism-proof cloth seats containing multi-colored patterns, as with the other Red Line stock.

They have modern [[Alternating current|AC]] traction motors with [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] controls manufactured by [[General Electric]], can operate only as mated pairs, and can partially interoperate with older cars in emergencies or non-revenue equipment moves, but not in revenue service.

====Increasing capacity====
In December 2008, the MBTA began running a set of modified 1800 series cars without seats, in order to increase train capacity. The MBTA the first transit operator in the United States with heavy rail operations to run cars modified for this purpose. These cars have been designated as "Big Red" cars, denoted by large stickers adjacent to the doors. New automated service announcements at stations alert passengers to the arrival of these high-capacity trains.<ref>[http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/news/x1720679869/MBTA-introduces-new-high-capacity-cars MBTA strips out the seats from some Red Line trains]</ref> So far, the MBTA has only one pair of modified cars, in a consist that runs only once during the morning rush hour, toward [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]], and once during the evening rush hour toward [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]], departing Alewife at the top of the evening rush.

===Replacement of 1500, 1600 series cars===
The MBTA is starting to design the next generation trains, which will replace the 1500 and 1600 series, which are now over 40 years old.  .<ref>New Subway Vehicle Procurement / 220 Rapid Transit Cars

==Art and architecture==
[[File:Kendall Band Archimedes.jpg|thumb|right|Kendall Band]]
{{see also|Arts on the Line}}

The MBTA pioneered a "percentage for art" [[public art]] program called [[Arts on the Line]] during its Northwest Extension of the Red Line in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Arts on the Line was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar drives for art across the country.

The [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall/MIT]] station features an interactive public art installation by [[Paul Matisse]] called the ''[[Kendall Band]]'', which allows the public to activate three sound-producing machines utilizing levers on the wall of the station.

Above the tracks at [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]] hangs a series of [[Neon art|red neon tubes]] called ''End of Red Line'' by the Boston artist Alejandro Sinha.  Several other stations feature public art.<ref>{{cite web

Newer aboveground stations (particularly Alewife, Braintree, and Quincy Adams, which all have large [[parking garage]]s) are excellent examples of [[brutalist]] architecture.
