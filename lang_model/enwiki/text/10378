'''La Paz''' (Official Name: '''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de La Paz''') is the administrative [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Bolivia]], as well as the departmental capital of [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz Department]]. Located at an [[elevation]] of 3,660 meters, it is the world's highest capital city.  La Paz sits in a bowl surrounded by the high altiplano. As it grows, La Paz climbs the hills, resulting in varying [[elevation]]s from 3,000 meters to 4,100 meters (9,840&nbsp;ft to 13,450&nbsp;ft). Overlooking the city is towering triple-peaked Illimani, always [[snow]]-covered and majestic.  As of the 2001 [[census]], the city of La Paz had a [[population]] of 877,363,<ref>[http://obd.descentralizacion.gov.bo/municipal/fichas/generales/localidad.php?var=20101 Observatorio Bolivia Democr<U+00E1>tica]</ref> and together with the neighboring cities of [[El Alto]] and [[Viacha]], make the most populous urban area of Bolivia,and is called [[Metro La Paz]] with a population of more than 2.3 million inhabitants <ref>http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1262838217&men=gpro&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-730&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&geo=-1048596</ref> (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica).
La Paz is also known as Chuquiago Marka or Chuqiyapu from [[Aymara]] "chuqi," meaning gold, and "yapu", meaning farm.

== History ==
Founded in 1548 by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s at the site of the [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] settlement, [[Laja]], the full name of the city was originally ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de La Paz'' (meaning ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of [[Peace]]''). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the [[rebellion|insurrection]] of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and fellow [[conquistador]]s four years earlier against [[Blasco N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez Vela]], the first [[viceroy]] of [[Peru]]. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326435/La-Paz] La Paz. (2008). In Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. Retrieved November 10, 2008, from Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online</ref>

Control over the former [[Inca]] lands had been entrusted to [[Pedro de la Gasca]] by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. Gasca commanded [[Alonso de Mendoza]] to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548.
[[File:Fundacion de La Paz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|La Paz Fundation.]]
[[File:Pedro Murillo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pedro Domingo Murillo]]]]

In 1549, [[Juan Gutierrez]] Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. La Plaza de los Espa<U+00F1>oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.

Spain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to the no longer peaceful city of La Paz. Under the leadership of [[Tupac Katari]], they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians laid a two-month siege on La Paz - where and when the legend of the [[Ekeko]] is set. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. It was on July 16, 1809 that Pedro Domingo Murillo famously said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn-off. This formally marked the beginning of the Liberation of South America from [[Spain]]. Pedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa<U+00F1>oles that night, but his name would be eternally remembered in the name of the plaza, and he would be remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.

In 1825, after the decisive victory of the [[republicanism|republican]]s at [[Ayacucho]] over the Spanish army in the course of the [[South American Wars of Independence]], the city's full name was changed to ''La Paz de Ayacucho'' (meaning ''The Peace of Ayacucho'').

In 1898, La Paz was made the ''[[de facto]]'' seat of the national government, with [[Sucre]] remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted [[silver]] [[mining|mine]]s of [[Potos<U+00ED>]] to the exploitation of [[tin]] near [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national [[elite]]s.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553809/La_Paz.html] "La Paz," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008. Retrieved November 10, 2008. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwsTdY9y Archived] 2009-10-31.</ref>

La Paz is the highest capital city in the world, and is home to the world's highest golf course, football stadium, velodrome (where the world record currently stands), and landing strip.

=== History Timeline of La Paz ===
! Year
! Event
|-
| 1548
| The city of La Paz was founded by [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers on the pre- existing site of Choqueyapu, an ancient Aymara village. It was founded as Nuestra Senora de La Paz (Our Lady of Peace) by [[Alonso de Mendoza]], commissioned by [[Pedro de la Gasca]], to commemorate the "pacification" of Peru. It was started as a commercial city, lying on the main gold and silver route to the coast. The Spaniards came for the Bolivian gold found in the Choqueapu River that runs through present-day La Paz. The Spaniards took the gold mines away from Aymara people and made them work as slaves. The primarily male Spanish population soon mixed with the indigenous people, creating a largely mestizo, or mixed, population.
|-
| 1549
| In November of this year, Juan Gutierrez was given the task of designing an urban plan, in keeping with the Code of the Indies (regulations on Spanish Colonial Cities from Spain). As such, he was to lay out plazas and public lands and designate sites for public buildings. The Plaza Murillo (pictured below) was later selected as the site for the city Cathedral, elite homes, and government buildings.
|-
| 1600
| As the gold slowly diminished, the city's location between [[Potosi]] (the primary silver mining town) and [[Lima]] grew in importance, as La Paz became a main stop on the trade route. Soon La Paz was the most flourishing town in the Altiplano area of the Andes, although it was not as wealthy as Potosi.
|-
| 1800
| La Paz emerges as the largest city of Upper Peru (the early name for Bolivia) in the late eighteenth century, acting as the center for the population and agricultural production zone. The heavily populated [[Altiplano]] hinterland above La Paz fed its growth. Many large estate land holders, known as hacendados, lived in La Paz throughout most of the year while they maintained a small community of indigenous people to live and work on their haciendas (landed estates).
|-
| 1800
|La Paz emerged as the capital of the Intendencia, the home of a thriving commercial community, and the center of an important network of interregional and international trade routes. The majority of the absentee landed elite resided in La Paz, creating the commerce and royal treasury from which more wealth could be generated for investment in the rural zones of the Intendencia. At that time in history, the capital and its provincial hinterland were one of the wealthiest tax-producing areas in all of the Andes. This early beginning, as the home of the rich land-lords of the haciendas, is still evident in the structure of the city today, as the finest example of old Spanish Colonial Architecture seen in houses is located close to the central plazas and offices of the city.
|-
| 1809
| July 16: the first South American libertarian scream against the Spanish Crown is given in La Paz, in a rebellion led by Pedro Domingo Murillo and the others revolutionaries.
|-
| 1825
| Bolivia gained independence, which sparked even more growth in the city. Simon Bolivar was the first president of the Republic. The country was divided in 5 departments: La Paz, [[Cochabamba]], [[Potos<U+00ED>]], [[Charkas]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].
|-
| 1840
| Bolivia started exporting more than it imported, allowing the government to engage in infrastructural investments with the surplus funds. This led to a growth of La Paz as the financial, commercial, and political capital of the area. "With new urban classes emerging, and new capital to spend, there was both increased demands for foodstuffs production and an aggressive class of urban-based capitalists willing to engage in agricultural production"(Klien 1993 134). However, at this time La Paz was virtually isolated from the rest of the world due to the poor roads and lack of rail lines leading over the harsh Altiplano to ports in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]]. Contact between La Paz and the eastern part of the country, surrounded by rainforest, was even more difficult.
|-
| 1879
| [[The Pacific War]] with Chile. The Chileans entered the country at the coast for the salitre and the guano(Nitrate-rich bird dung). The result of this brutal war was the loss of Bolivia's coast land to [[Chile]].
|-
| 1898
| La Paz becomes de facto Bolivia's new administrative capital and the seat of the government, thus starting the process of development into the large city it is today.
|-
| 1900
| Construction began on the international railroad network linking La Paz to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, thus solidifying the future role of La Paz as a [[primate city]].  At this period in time the Bolivian government spent an annual spendings of $5,986,384.
|-
| 1921
| The first oil company came to Bolivia. Bolivia was found to have great reservoirs of oil, in addition to all the precious minerals.
|-
| 1952
| The great national revolution when the revolutionaries won the rights for the indigenous people. Their biggest accomplishment was agrarian land reform, which allowed peasants to have freedom from the obligations of working on the elite-owned land, diffusing the long-established hacienda system. This in turn sparked a great growth spurt in the city, as many working-class and poor migrated to urban areas.
|-
| 1963
|  Playing at home, Bolivia wins South American football (soccer) championships.
|-
| 1964
| Military revolution, with the help of the [[United States]], that established the dictatorial rule that would remain until 1980. The last dictator was [[General Hugo Banzer]]. He held elections in 1980, although, suspiciously, Banzer's candidate won and was president until the year 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/GEOG61/amartin/history.html |title=Macalester College Course GEOG61 |publisher=Macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>

== Principal Neighborhoods and Zones ==
[[File:SAN JORGE La Paz BOLIVIA.jpg|thumbnail|250px|San Jorge.]]
* '''Casco Viejo:''' is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the [[Central Bank of Bolivia]]. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.
* '''Downtown:''' locally known as "Downtown", comprises the center of La Paz and the neighborhoods of San Jorge and Sopocachi. It<U+00B4>s the main financial center of the city and where almost every government office is located.
[[File:Skyline of La Paz Bolivia.jpg|thumb|250px|Central Bank of Bolivia in the Middle.]]
[[File:Sopocachi.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sopocachi.]]
* '''Sopocachi:''' probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, located 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property.
* '''San Pedro:''' Built around the "Plaza de San Pedro" (official name: Plaza Sucre) on the right bank of the river Choqueyapu, is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro<U+00B4>s "Rodriguez Market" remains as one of the most important and oldest of the city.
[[File:Av. Ballivi<U+00E1>n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Calacoto]]
* '''Miraflores:''' Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (now called Parque Urbano Central) and connected by the [[Puente de las Am<U+00E9>ricas (Bolivia)|Bridge of the Americas]] and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the [[Universidad Mayor de San Andr<U+00E9>s]]'s faculty of medicine), hospitals and the [[Estadio Hernando Siles]](cap. 45,000 people).
*'' 'Northern District:''' has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the [[Cervecer<U+00ED>a Boliviana Nacional]] (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans ,and one of the city's  biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the "autopista"or Highway.
*'' 'Southern District:''' has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses the most affluent business and the richest neighborhoods of the city, like [[Calacoto]], La Florida, Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like [[Moody's]], [[Citibank]], [[Aon Corporation]], [[Huawei]], [[Millicom]] International Cellular, [[Pan American Silver Corporation]], a [[Sumitomo Corporation]] branch, [[Ernst & Young]], and the [[Mega Center]] Bolivia<U+00B4>s biggest [[shopping mall]] (52.000 mts2 of construction).

== Economy ==
The economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political leaders. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large Informal Economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. While there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it. La Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. Historically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. "The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development."

Located at {{Coord|16|30|0|S|68|08|0|W|city}} (-16.5, -68.1333), La Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.

The geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) reflects society: the lower areas of the city are the more affluent areas. While many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center, the houses of the truly affluent are located in the lower neighborhoods southwest of the Prado. And looking up from the center, the surrounding hills are plastered with makeshift brick houses of those of less economic fortune.

The satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the [[Altiplano]].

La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, very unusual topography, and traditional culture.

Under the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]], La Paz has a [[Oceanic climate|Subtropical highland climate]]. Owing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool throughout the year, though the [[diurnal temperature variation]] is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March. The sun passes directly overhead in late October and mid February.

La Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, and is closer to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. Therefore, it is closer to the famous mountains such as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the West of the La Paz, is the site of the tallest mountain in Bolivia and 9th tallest mountain in the Andes, the Sajama Volcano.  In July 1994, an [[1994 Bolivia earthquake|earthquake]] rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles north of La Paz, the largest earthquake since the Sumbawa earthquake of 1977.  Part of the water supply is derived from glaciers, which are becoming a less reliable source of water.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shukman |first=David |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8394324.stm |title=Glacier threat to Bolivia capital |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>

== Sports ==

*'''[[The Strongest]]'''. Founded in 1908 and hosts some of its games and trains on its home stadium. Is the oldest team, and the one that has won more tournaments during the 20th century. It has its own stadium named Rafael Mendoza. Don Rafael Mendoza was one of the most important presidents. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts so that the team rises again as one of the most importants of the country. For more info you can check http://www.clubthestrongest.net/
*'''[[La Paz F.C.]]'''.
However, both teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, '''[[Estadio Hernando Siles]]'''. It is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as: [[Mariscal Braun]] (2nd), Always Ready (3rd), Municipal (3rd) and Chaco Petrolero (3rd).

La Paz also hosts the national football team and a plethora of international games.

=== Education ===
La Paz as a modern city has the best universities of the country such as :

* [[Universidad Mayor de San Andr<U+00E9>s]].Opened in 1830,the second oldest university in [[Bolivia]].

== Tourism and Sites ==
La Paz is the cultural center of Bolivia.
[[File:Monolitos Miraflores La Paz Bolivia.jpg|thumb|160px| [[Tiwanaku]] Square in front of the football stadium]]
Some of the notable sites are the marketplaces. These are located across the city and one will most likely run through one at some point. Also, the city is home to hundreds of museums and locations such as the Cathedral of San Francisco (where the saint is buried), the Metropolitan Cathedral (home of Sucre's remains), the Palacio Quemado (executive building), the Congress (which one may attend sometimes), the Calle Jaen (preserved from its Spanish days, home to 10 museums), the [[Valle de la Luna (Bolivia)|Valle de la Luna]] (Valley of the Moon), the [[Muela del diablo]] (Devil's Tooth), the Cine-Teatro Municipal (built in the 19th century), the largest state University (Universidad Mayor de San Andres), the Cementerio General (where many of Bolivia's presidents are buried), the house of Simon Bolivar, the Devil's Tooth (geological formation, hiking site), and many more.
Supposable curses have been put on the land because of the disturbance in the ruins when Jose Galvaerio was murdered by Mateo Sanhosea.
[[File:Valle de la Luna - La Paz - Bolivia.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Valle de la Luna]].]]
The city is located near many natural and ancient ruins as well. Many tourists chose to take day trips to the [[Tiahuanacu]] ruins, which are thousands of years older than [[Macchu Picchu]] itself and of the same magnitude. Such is the interest in these ruins, that Chilean and Peruvian trips almost always include this site, even though it is in Bolivia. Another day trip visit tourists usually include is the [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakeside city of Copacabana (its cathedral is visited by many Bolivians to see the Virgen de Copacabana figure, deity of the Lake).

== Tourism in the City ==
Presidential Palace: Also known as the [[Palacio Quemado]] (Burnt Palace) due to repeated fire episodes the building endured in the past.

The Cathedral: Built in 1835, the cathedral is an impressive building worth seeing. It is located in the [[Plaza Murillo]] nest to the Presidential Palace.

Churches: San Francisco, Santo Domingo

Casa de [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]]: Once the house of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809 (hanged in the plaza that now bores his name) the house displays a collection of furniture, textiles, and art from colonial times.

Museo Costumbrista: Displays amazing ceramic dolls wearing traditional customs that show how was life in the early 1800s. Also displays are photos of old La Paz.
