==Plot==
Spanish teacher [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) learns that [[Sandy Ryerson]] ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]), the head of William McKinley High School's [[glee club]] has been fired. The school principal ([[Iqbal Theba]]) gives Will permission to take over the club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club members consist of fame-hungry [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), diva [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]), gay soprano [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), [[paraplegic]] [[electric guitar]] player [[Artie Abrams]] ([[Kevin Michael McHale|Kevin McHale]]) and [[stuttering]] goth [[Tina Cohen-Chang]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]). Will's efforts are derided by [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]), head of the school's successful [[cheerleading]] team, the Cheerios. His wife [[Terri Schuester|Terri]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]) is also unsupportive, suggesting Will become an accountant to increase their income. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach [[Ken Tanaka]] ([[Patrick Gallagher]]) allows Will to try and recruit football team members, he discovers that [[quarterback]] [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) is secretly a talented singer. He plants [[marijuana]] in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies. 

Will takes New Directions to see Vocal Adrenaline, a rival club, perform. He is accompanied by [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]), the school's [[Mysophobia|mysophobic]] [[guidance counselor]], who has an unrequited crush on him. Vocal Adrenaline perform an impressive rendition of [[Amy Winehouse]]'s "[[Rehab (Amy Winehouse song)|Rehab]]", which leaves New Directions worried about their chances of competing in the regional [[show choir]] competition. When Will returns from the performance, Terri informs him she is pregnant. Believing he needs to support his family, Will regretfully tells the club he is resigning, and applies for a job as an accountant. Finn is attacked by the football team for his involvement with New Directions, and initially decides to quit the club. When the team traps Artie in a [[portable toilet]] which they intend to [[outhouse tipping|tip over]], however, Finn refuses to take part. He apologizes to the glee club members, and the group resolves to continue on without Will. Emma urges Will to re-consider his decision to leave, and when he comes across New Directions performing "[[Don't Stop Believin']]" he decides to stay, telling the club he couldn't bear to see them win Nationals without him.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Pilot |episodelink=Pilot (Glee) |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy]] (director, writer), Brad Falchuk (writer), Ian Brennan (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2009-05-19 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref>

==Production==
===Conception===
''Glee'' was created by [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. Murphy drew inspiration from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role in all of his high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs.<ref name="Variety"/> Brennan originally wrote a script for a ''Glee'' movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series.<ref name="LAT"/> [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part to the success of the network's ''[[American Idol]]'', commenting: "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein".<ref name="Variety"/> Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism."<ref name="Variety"/> With regards to ''Glee''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads.<ref name="Variety">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989408.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Fox greenlights 'Glee' pilot |last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=23 July, 2008|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}</ref> ''Glee'' is set in [[Lima, Ohio]].

===Music===
The episode features covers of numerous songs sung on-screen by the characters.

===Casting===
[[File:Matthew Morrison 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Morrison was cast after Murphy spent three months observing actors on Broadway.]]
In casting ''Glee'', Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in ''[[Hairspray]]'' and ''[[The Light in the Piazza]]'', Michele, who starred in ''[[Spring Awakening]]'', and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of ''[[The King and I]]''. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele.<ref name="bs">{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/news-and-features-features/life-stages-1004009175.story|title=Life Stages |last=Kuhn|first=Sarah|date=September 3, 2009|work=[[Back Stage]]|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan of the character of Kurt from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', and was thusly cast as Kurt Hummel.<ref name="rewrite">{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-gleestage26-2009apr26,0,1653470.story |title=Video: 'Glee' team rewrites the school musical |first=Denise |last=Martin |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 26, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> He originally auditioned for Artie with the song "[[Chicago (musical)#Musical numbers and analysis|Mr Cellophane]]", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him.<ref name="bs"/> Colfer commented on his casting: "I'm so happy to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time. It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up. It's true: You can be famous - even if there's no money left in the world."<ref name="LAT">{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-glee26-2009apr26,0,7366573.story|title=Will TV audiences watch with 'Glee'?|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|date=April 26, 2009|work=[[LA Times]]|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}</ref>

Auditioning actors with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Mays auditioned with the song "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" from ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', while Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sung "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" of [[REO Speedwagon]]'s "[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]"."<ref name="rewrite"/> Monteith has deemed his casting "spot on" as: "I'm just like my character.

They're shot and performed with verve, and they put to shame those medleys contestants often perform on the Wednesday edition of ''American Idol''",<ref name="CT"/> but again observed: "Whether it will work as a satirical dramedy about the cutthroat social environment of high school is another matter."<ref name="CT"/> Of the principal cast, Ryan opined: "Casting Matthew Morrison as Will Schuester [...] was a wise move; the actor not only has a sweet voice but a hangdog hopefulness that gives a needed anchor to the show's more satirical elements. Cory Monteith gives quarterback Finn Hudson a jock-ish authority mixed with an appealingly square naivete, and Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless stereotype."<ref name="CT"/> She was critical, however, of Gilsig as Terri, calling her "the worst thing about ''Glee''" and opining: "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell."<ref name="CT">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-tc-tvcolumn-glee-0518-0519may19,0,676134.story|title='Glee' gets golden time slot, needs a better tune|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|date=May 19, 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> 

In contrast, Tom Shales for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticized Morrison as Will, writing: "Morrison is definitely not gleeful and doesn't seem particularly well equipped to be a high-school impresario; as pipers go, he's not even marginally pied."<ref name="WP"/> Shales was more positive regarding Lynch's performance, and concluded that: "Dramatic tension isn't exactly plentiful, but pleasingly staged songs and a general aura of retro ingenuousness come through, and seem awfully if fitfully refreshing".<ref name="WP">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/18/AR2009051802837.html|title=Sharply, Fox Provides A Reason For 'Glee' |last=Shales|first=Tom|date=May 19, 2009|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Brian Lowry also highlighted acting and characterization issues with the show, writing that: "It's among the adults, alas - who are mostly over-the-top buffoons - where ''Glee'' nearly sails off the rails, from Jane Lynch's tyrannical cheer matron to the salivating football coach, a bit like the Rydell High gang in ''Grease''."<ref name="Variety">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940256.html?categoryid=32&cs=1|title=Glee|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=May 14, 2009|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref> Lowry opined that: "Modest redemption comes from the stammering Emma (''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Jayma Mays), who has a clear crush on Will, even though he's married to his high-school sweetheart. Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, said wife (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew."<ref name="Variety"/> Mary McNamara for the ''[[LA Times]]'' has called ''Glee'': "the first show in a long time that's just plain full-throttle, no-guilty-pleasure-rationalizations-necessary fun."<ref name="McNamara">{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-glee19-2009may19,0,3088358.story|title='Glee' on Fox|last=McNamara|first=Mary|date=May 19, 2009|work=[[LA Times]]|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}</ref> She praised Lynch as Sue, writing that "Lynch alone makes ''Glee'' worth watching", and opined that overall: "The music, though by no means edgy, is energetic with a wide audience appeal, like the show itself.<ref name="McNamara"/>
