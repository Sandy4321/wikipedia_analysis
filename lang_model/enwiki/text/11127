The annual '''International Symposium on Rules ''' ('''RuleML''') is an international conference on research, applications, languages and standards for rule technologies. It is a conference in the field of [[rule-based programming]] and [[Rule-based_system|rule-based systems]] including [[Production_system|production rules systems]], [[Logic_programming|logic programming rule engines]], and [[Business_rules_engine|business rules engines]]/[[Business_rule_management_system|business rules management systems]]; [[Semantic_web|Semantic Web]] rule languages and rule standards (e.g., [[RuleML]], [[SWRL]], [[Rule_Interchange_Format|RIF]], [[Production_Rule_Representation|PRR]], [[Semantics_of_Business_Vocabulary_and_Business_Rules|SBVR]]); [[Complex_event_processing|rule-based event processing languages (EPLs) and technologies]]; and research on [[inference]] rules, [[Rule_of_inference|transformation rules]], [[decision rules]], [[Production_rule|production rules]], and [[Event_Condition_Action|ECA rules]]. RuleML is commonly listed together with and related to other major general [[List_of_artificial_intelligence_conferences|Artificial Intelligence conferences]] worldwide. <ref>See, e.g., [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/stats/venues RuleML is in the top 100 venues for impact factor on CiteSeerX (place 71)].</ref> <ref>See, e.g., figure 3 in [http://www.disco.ethz.ch/publications/apweb08.pdf  Michael Kuhn and Roger Wattenhofer.

== History and past events ==
The conference series has been held without interruption since 2002. The RuleML Symposium has evolved from an annual series of first international workshops since 2002, international conferences in 2005 and 2006, and international symposia since 2007.

== International Rule Challenge ==
The [http://ruleml-challenge.cs.nccu.edu.tw  International Rule Challenge] is one of the highlights of the RuleML symposium. It calls for submissions of benchmarks/evaluations, demos, case studies / use cases, experience reports, best practice solutions (e.g. design patterns, reference architectures, models), rule-based implementations/ tools/ applications, demonstrations engineering methods, implementations of rule standards and industrial problem statements.

The [http://ruleml-challenge.cs.nccu.edu.tw International Rule Challenge] has been held since 2007.
