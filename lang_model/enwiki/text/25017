'''Ralph Everard Gonsalves''' (born [[August 8]], [[1946]]), also known as "Comrade Ralph", is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Prime Minister]] of [[St Vincent and the Grenadines]].  He has held that position since [[March 29]] [[2001]]. He is leader of the [[Unity Labour Party]], and won the 2001 general elections by a landslide of 12 seats to 3, after a close run in the 1998 elections. He was re-elected in the December 2005 elections with the same parliamentary ratio.

He first entered political life as a student at the [[University of the West Indies]] at [[Mona, Jamaica]]; in 1968, as president of the Guild of Undergraduates, Gonsalves led the student protest at the banning of popular historian and intellectual [[Walter Rodney]].

Gonsalves received his Ph.D. in political science from UWI, Mona, and went on to receive a law degree from the University of the West Indies, [[Cave Hill, Barbados]] before returning to practise law and become an active politician in his homeland.

He has said, "Modern terrorism is a barbarism out of sync with civilized life."[http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/61/pdfs/st_vincents_grenadines-e.pdf]
