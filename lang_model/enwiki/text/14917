'''A. R. 'Bob' McLean''' (born [[February 1]], [[1914]]) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played for [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Norwood Football Club|Norwood]] in the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL) and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL). Affectionately referred to as 'Big Bob' McLean, he later became a long serving football administrator in South Australia.

As a player, McLean was mainly a ruckman but was also handy around goals, kicking 471 of them during his 221 games SANFL career. He started out at Norwood before crossing to Port Adelaide and participating in their 1939 premiership win. On four occasions he topped Port Adelaide's goal-kicking - 1940, 1941, 1947 and 1948. His tally of 80 goals in 1947 was enough to win him the league's [[Ken Farmer Medal|Leading goal-kicker]] award. He also represented South Australia in nine interstate matches over the course of his career. 

While on military service in Melbourne he made three appearances for St Kilda's seniors in the 1941 season.

He was appointed 'Club Secretary' of Port Adelaide in 1949 and remained in the job until 1980. From 1983 to 1989 he acted as 'Club Chairman'. McLean was also a SANFL League Director for 29 years and state selector for 17 years.

In 2007 he was inducted into the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]]. Five years earlier he had been one of the inaugural inductees in the [[South Australian Football Hall of Fame]].
