'''Fayum mummy portraits''' is the name given to a large number of paintings from the first to third century. These are [[encaustic painting]]s, made with hot, pigmented [[wax]] on wooden panels, which were inserted into the [[mummies]] of the deceased. Fayum portraits represent the mostly Greek inhabitants<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-59912/Egyptian-art-and-architecture/ Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online - Egyptian art and architecture - Greco-Roman Egypt]</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033869/al-Fayyum/ Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online - Fayyum]</ref> of Egypt and are some of the most interesting examples of surviving Greek art<ref> The Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Julia de Wolf Gibbs Addison, L. C. Page & company, p.242</ref> in Ancient Egypt. The surviving paintings are predominantly from the [[Fayum]] region in [[Egypt]] and were completed during [[Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods in a province of Egypt which had been settled primarily by Greek colonists<ref> Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings as Egyptian Pharaohs, Paul Edmund Stanwick, University of Texas Press, p.23 </ref><ref>The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World, Cambridge University Press, p.39</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033869/al-Fayyum/ Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online - Fayyum]</ref>, many of whom were soldier-veterans. The practice was common and the painters of the Fayum were either Greek residents<ref> Egypt, Cherine Badawi, p.120 </ref><ref> Restaura<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de Pinturas: aplica<U+00E7><U+00F5>es da enc<U+00E1>ustica, Edson Motta, Maria Luiza Guimar<U+00E3>es Salgado, p.93 </ref><ref> The World Museums Guide, Barbara Cooper, Maureen Matheson, Barbara Rosen, Threshold Books Ltd, p.66 </ref> dating from the Ptolemaic period of the late 4th century bc, or those who had inherited the Greek artistic tradition. The dry climate of the region preserved many of the paintings until today.

Most of the portraits depict the deceased at a relatively young age, and many show children. According to Walker (2000), "[[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scans of all the complete mummies represented [in Walker (2000)] reveal a correspondence of age and, in suitable cases, sex between mummy and image." Walker concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. The wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, this custom belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]]<ref> Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece,  Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p.601 </ref>. After the person was deceased, the portrait panel was placed over the mummified individuals face.

Together with the surviving frescoes and objects from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and tomb frescoes in [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonia]], they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalistim]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.

Many musueums around the world have fine examples of Fayum mummy portraits on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[Royal Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York]] and the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].
