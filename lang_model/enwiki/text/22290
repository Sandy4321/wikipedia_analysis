The Department and municipality are further split into four sub-prefectures: Atti<U+00E9>gouakro, Didi<U+00E9>vi, Ti<U+00E9>- di<U+00E9>kro and the Commune of Yamoussoukro, which contain 169 villages and hamlets.

==History==

===Colonial period history===
Chief [[Yamousso]], the niece of [[Kouassi N'Go]], ran the village of ''N'Gokro'' at the time of [[French colonization]]. The village then comprised 475 inhabitants, and was one of 129 [[Akou<U+00E9>]] villages.

Diplomatic and commercial relations were then established but, in [[1909]], on the orders of the Chief of [[Djamlabo]], the Akou<U+00E9> revolted against the administration. [[Bonzi]] station, seven kilometers from Yamoussoukro on the [[Bouafl<U+00E9>]] road, was set on fire, and the French administrator, [[Simon Maurice]], was spared only by the intervention of Kouassi N'Go. This respected former leader persuaded the Akou<U+00E9> not to wage a war which could only have turned into a disaster.

As the situation returned to normal, [[Simon Maurice]], judging that Bonzi had become unsafe, decided to transfer the French military station to Yamoussoukro, where the French Administration built a pyramid to the memory of Kouassi N'Go, Chief of the Akou<U+00E9>, and in homage to Yamousso, N'Gokro was renamed Yamoussoukro.

In [[1919]], the civil station of Yamoussoukro was removed, and [[F<U+00E9>lix Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny]] became the leader of the village in 1939. A long period was passed where Yamoussoukro, small agricultural town, remained in the shadows, until after the war, when it saw the creation of the [[African Agricultural Trade Union]], and first conferences of its Chief. But it was only with Independence that Yamoussoukro finally started to rise.

===History since independence===
After [[1964]], the President [[F<U+00E9>lix Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny]] made ambitious plans and started to build. One day in 1965, later called the Great Lesson of Yamoussoukro, he visited the plantations with the leaders of the county, inviting them to transpose to their own villages the efforts and agricultural achievements of the region. On [[July 21]], [[1977]], Houphou<U+00EB>t offered its plantations to the State.

In March [[1983]], Yamoussoukro became the political and administrative capital of [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]].  This marked the fourth movement of the country's capital city in just one century.  C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire's previous capital cities were [[Abidjan]] (1933), [[Bingerville]] (1900), and [[Grand-Bassam]] (1893). The majority of economic activity still takes place in [[Abidjan]].

==Highlights==
Yamoussoukro is also the site of what is claimed to be largest Christian place of worship on Earth: The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]], consecrated by [[Pope John Paul II]] on [[September 10]], [[1990]].

Also noteworthy are the [[Kossou Dam]], the [[F<U+00E9>lix Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny Foundation]], the [[PDCI-GDR House]], the various schools of the [[F<U+00E9>lix-Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny-Boigny Polytechnic Institute]], the international [[airport]] (with an average of six hundred passengers and 36 flights in 1995, it is one of two airports in Africa (with [[Gbadolite]]) that can accommodate the [[Concorde]]), the Town Hall, the Protestant Temple, the Mosque, and the [[Palace of Hosts]].

On [[November 6]], [[2004]], [[Yamoussoukro Airport]] was attacked by French infantry after military aircraft from the airport bombed a [[UN]] [[peacekeeping|peacekeeper]] base as well as rebel targets and 9 French peacekeepers and one U.S. civilian were killed. Two Ivory Coast [[Sukhoi Su-25]] aircraft and several [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopters were destroyed, which was most of the country's air forces. Mobs and rebels  tried to attack the French forces after the airport raid but were quickly suppressed and sold.
