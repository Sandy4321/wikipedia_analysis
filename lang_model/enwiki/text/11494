The '''superior orbital fissure''' is a [[foramen]] in the skull, although strictly it is more of a cleft, lying between the [[Small wings of the sphenoid|lesser]] and [[Great wings of the sphenoid|greater wings]] of the [[sphenoid]] [[bone]].

==Structures passing through==
A number of important [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures pass through the fissure, and these can be damaged in [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] trauma, particularly [[blowout fracture]]s through the floor of the orbit into the [[maxillary sinus]]. These structures are:
* superior and inferior divisions of [[oculomotor nerve]] (III) 
* [[trochlear nerve]] (IV) 
* [[lacrimal nerve|lacrimal]], [[frontal nerve|frontal]] and [[nasociliary nerve|nasociliary]] branches of [[ophthalmic nerve]] ([[trigeminal nerve|V1]])
* [[abducens nerve]] (VI) 
* [[superior ophthalmic vein]] 
* [[sympathetic fibers]] from [[cavernous plexus]]

Perhaps inevitably, a ribald [[mnemonic]] has been dreamt up by medical students:<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|42|38|454|1001}}</ref>
"Lazy French Tarts Sit Naked In Anticipation Of Sex" - for Lacrimal, Frontal, Trochlear,
Superior Division of Oculomotor, Nasociliary, Inferior Division of Oculomotor, Abducens nerves, Ophthalmic vein, Sympathetic nerves.

==Pathology==
The abducens nerve is most likely to show [[sign (medicine)|sign]]s of damage first, with the most common complaints retro-orbital [[Pain and nociception|pain]] and the involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, V1, and VI without other neurological signs or symptoms. This presentation indicates either compression of structures in the superior orbital fissure or the [[cavernous sinus]].

===Superior orbital fissure syndrome===
'''Superior orbital fissure syndrome''', also known as '''Rochon-Duvigneaud's syndrome''', is a neurological disorder that results if the superior orbital fissure is [[fracture|fractured]]. Involvement of the cranial nerves that pass through the superior orbital fissure may lead to III, [[diplopia]], [[paralysis]] of extraocular motions, [[exophthalmos]], [[ptosis]]. [[Blindness]] or loss of vision indicates involvement of the orbital apex, which is more serious, requiring urgent surgical intervention.
