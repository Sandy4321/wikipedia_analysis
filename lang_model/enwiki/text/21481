The group was founded in 2010 as the US branch of [[Stop Islamisation of Europe]].

===2010===
SIOA first entered the public eye with its early opposition to the construction of [[Park51]], a 13-story Muslim community center proposed for a location two blocks from the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. On May 6, 2010, following community approval of the project, Geller posted a blog piece<ref name=fear>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/08/16/ground_zero_mosque_origins/|title=How the "ground zero mosque" fear mongering began|first=Justin|last=Elliott|date=August 16, 2010|work=Salon}}</ref> calling the building a "Monster Mosque".<ref>{{cite book|title=Lessons and Legacies of the War on Terror: From Moral Panic to Permanent War|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=0415638410|series=Critical Terrorism Studies|editor=Gershon Shafir, Everard Meade, William J.

In July 2010, the organization purchased [[bus advertising]] in New York<ref name="Telegraph"/> and other American cities promoting a website offering "refuge from Islam."<ref name="CSM">{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Rice |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2010/0728/Anti-Islamic-bus-ads-appear-in-major-cities |title='Anti-Islamic' bus ads appear in major cities |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=July 28, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref> According to Pamela Geller, the ads "were designed to help provide resources for Muslims who were fearful of leaving the faith".<ref name="Telegraph">{{Cite news|work=Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7772258/Leaving-Islam-bus-adverts-draw-anger-in-NYC.html|title='Leaving Islam?' bus adverts draw anger in NYC|date=May 27, 2010}}</ref>  The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] criticized the premise of the ads, that there were any such Muslims, calling it "a smoke screen to advance [Geller's] long-standing history of anti-Muslim bigotry".<ref name="Telegraph"/>

===2011===
The Southern Poverty Law Center named SIOA an anti-Muslim [[hate group]] in February 2011,<ref name=nydaily>{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/southern-poverty-law-center-lists-anti-islamic-nyc-blogger-pamela-geller-followers-hate-group-article-1.135009|work=New York Daily News|date=February 25, 2011|first=Corky|title=Southern Poverty Law Center lists anti-Islamic NYC blogger Pamela Geller, followers a hate group|last=Siemaszko}}</ref> calling it a "propaganda powerhouse" that paints moderate Muslims as radical terrorists.<ref name=HateGroup>{{cite news|work=The Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/summer/jihad-against-islam|date=Summer 2011|issue=142|first=Robert|last=Steinback|title=Jihad Against Islam}}</ref> The [[Anti-Defamation League]] also lists it as a hate group, saying that it "promotes a conspiratorial anti-Muslim agenda under the guise of fighting radical Islam" and "seeks to rouse public fears by consistently vilifying the Islamic faith and asserting the existence of an Islamic conspiracy to destroy 'American' values."<ref name=ADL>{{cite web |url=http://archive.adl.org/main_extremism/sioa-a.html#.UtI2J6zGWeg |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |work=Extremism |title=Stop the Islamization of America (SIOA) |date=September 14, 2010}}</ref>

In July and August 2011, Geller and Spencer were discussed in the media because Norwegian mass-murderer [[Anders Behring Breivik]]'s anti-Muslim manifesto quoted Spencer at length and also cited Geller's blog.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/25debate.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Killings in Norway Spotlight Anti-Muslim Thought in U.S. |last=Shane |first=Scott |date=July 24, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> According to Heidi Beirich, Deputy Director of [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]], Geller and Spencer's writings were "the primary sources for the anti-Muslim propaganda that had helped give voice" to Breivik's 1500+ page manifesto.<ref name=Beirich2013/>  SIOA published a statement jointly with [[Jihad Watch]] and [[Stop Islamisation of Europe]] condemning Breivik's attack.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Critics of Islam Vow To Continue Activism After Oslo|publisher=The Forward|last1=Nathan-Kazis|first1=Josh|last2=Guttman|first2=Nathan|date=August 5, 2011|quote=A statement published on July 25 on Jihad Watch, by Spencer and Geller <U+2019>s SIOA and Stop Islamisation of Europe, their group<U+2019>s European ally, condemned the attacks.  The statement went on to say that Breivik had attempted to join SOIE but had been kept out of the organization 'because of his Nazi ties.'}}</ref>

SIOA ran another series of ads in the New York City subway in September 2012, reading "In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad."<ref name=attacked/> Several groups have sponsored subway ads to counter SIOA's original ad and condemn it as "hate speech."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/pro-muslim-subway-ads-to-hang-near-anti-jihad-ads/|newspaper=New York Times|title=Pro-Muslim Subway Ads to Hang Near Anti-Jihad Ads|date=Oct 4, 2012|first=Ashwaq|last=Masood}}</ref> The [[Jewish Council for Public Affairs]] has called it "bigoted, divisive" and JCPA President Rabbi Steve Gutow has said "the fact that ads have been placed in the subway attacking Israel does not excuse the use of attack ads against Muslims."<ref>{{cite web|title=JCPA Condemns Bigoted, Divisive, and Unhelpful Anti-Muslim Ads|url=http://engage.jewishpublicaffairs.org/blog/comments.jsp?key=477&blog_entry_KEY=6561&t=|publisher=JCPA|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}</ref>   [[William McGurn]], former speechwriter for President Bush, wrote an editorial in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' supporting the ads.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGurn|first=William|title=Call a Terrorist a <U+2018>Savage<U+2019>?

In early January 2013 the AFDI placed over 200 advertisements in New York City subway stations.<ref name=inflammatory/>  The ads juxtaposed images of the [[September 11 attacks]] with a quote from the Koran: "Soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2012/12/pamela-geller-mta-new-anti-islam-ads-to-debut-this-month-now-with-25-more-mta-disclaimer/|title=New Anti-Islam Ads to Debut This Month, Now With 25% More MTA Disclaimer|last=Epstein|first=Emily Anne|work=The New York Observer|date=December 7, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2014}} The quote is from [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/koran/koran-idx?type=DIV0&byte=72808 3:151]</ref> The [[New York City Transit Authority]], required by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] to accept the advertisements, insisted that 25% of their area contain a Transit Authority disclaimer.<ref name="Matt Flegenheimer">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/nyregion/controversial-group-has-new-anti-jihad-subway-ads.html?ref=nyregion&_r=1&|title=Controversial Group Plans More Ads in Subway Stations|date=Dec 13, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|first=Matt|last=Flegenheimer}}</ref> The ads ran for a month.<ref name=inflammatory>{{cite news|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/01/08/more-ads-with-inflammatory-messages-about-islam-appear-in-nyc-subway/|title=More Ads With Inflammatory Messages About Islam Appear In NYC Subway|date=January 8, 2013|publisher=CBS news}}</ref>

On June 26, 2013, the United Kingdom [[Home Secretary]] acted to prevent Geller and Spencer from entering the UK to attend a rally organised by the far-right [[English Defense League]].
