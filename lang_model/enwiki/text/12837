'''''Empire Endurance''''' was a {{GRT|8,514|first=short}} [[cargo liner]] that was built in 1927 as '''''Alster''''' by [[Deutsche Werft]], [[Hamburg]], Germany for the shipping company [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. In the years leading up to the [[World War II|Second World War]] ''Alster'' carried cargo and passengers between Germany and Australia. After the outbreak of war she was requisitioned by the [[Kriegsmarine]] for use as a supply ship.

''Alster'' was captured off Norway on 10 April 1940 by the British destroyer {{HMS|Icarus|D03|6}}. Initially serving under the original name as a repair, supply and cargo ship in Norway, she was later passed to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT) and renamed ''Empire Endurance''. She served until 20 April 1941 when she was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by the German submarine {{GS|U-73|1940|2}} south-east of [[Rockall]], [[Inverness-shire]], United Kingdom.

==Description==
The ship was a {{GRT|8,514|first=short}} [[cargo liner]].

''Alster'' was {{convert|509|ft|9|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|63|ft|6|in|m|2}}. She had a depth of {{convert|30|ft|9|in|m|2}}<!--, and a draught of {{convert|xx|ft|x|in|m|2}}-->.

The ship was propelled by a 1000 [[nominal horsepower|nhp]] [[triple expansion steam engine]], which had cylinders of 31{{frac|1|4}} inches (79 cm), 52{{frac|3|4}} inches (134 cm) and 86{{frac|5|6}} inches (220 cm) diameter by 57{{frac|1|16}} inches (145 cm ) stroke.

===Norwegian Campaign and capture===
On 18 March 1940, ''Alster'' was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine. She was used as a supply ship in [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung]] - the German invasion of Norway, forming part of the invasion's {{lang|de|''Ausfuhr-Staffel''}}, transporting heavy equipment.<ref name=Uboat/><ref name=bcruiser>{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWD-HF1940BCS1B.htm |title=Admiralty War Diaries of World War 2: Vice Admiral, Battlecruiser Squadron, Home Fleet - May to December 1940 |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=16 July 2011 |work=Naval-History.net }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://niehorster.orbat.com/011_germany/40-04_scandinavia/navy_ausfuhr.html |title=Scandinavian Campaign: Equipment Transport Echelon |accessdate=10 March 2012 |last=Niehorster  |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Niehorster}}</ref> ''Alster'' departed [[Brunsb<U+00FC>ttel]] at 02:00 on 3 April, destined for the [[Northern Norway|North Norwegian]] port of [[Narvik]]. She was one of four supply ships sailing from the [[Schleswig-Holstein Province|Schleswig-Holstein]] port in support of German forces landing at Narvik on 9 April, under cover of sailing to [[Murmansk]] in the Soviet Union.<ref>Sandvik 1965 vol. 1, p. 135</ref> None of these ships made it to their destination.{{#tag:ref|The three other supply ship sailing from Brunsb<U+00FC>ttel were {{SS|B<U+00E4>renfels|1921|2}}, ''Kattegat'' and {{SS|Rauenfels|1928|2}}. In addition to these, the tanker ''Jan Wellem'' sailed from the German [[Basis Nord]] near Murmansk. ''Jan Wellem'' was the only German supply ship to reach its destination before the invasion began. While ''Alster'' was captured, ''B<U+00E4>renfels'' was redirected to Bergen, ''Kattegat'' was sunk by the Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Nordkapp}} and ''Rauenfels'' was knocked out by the destroyer {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}.<ref>Lunde 2010, pp. 188{{dash}}189</ref><ref>Haar 2009, pp. 66, 68</ref>|group=Note}} The lack of supplies and artillery would leave the German forces [[Battles of Narvik|fighting at Narvik]] vulnerable.

At Kopervik the German plans suffered a delay because of a lack of [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] to guide the ship northwards, the ships departing Kopervik only on 6 April. Many of the other supply ships sent out in advance of the invasion also suffered delays, putting the supply part of the invasion plans out of schedule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4004-13APR01.htm |title=Naval Events, April 1940, Part 1 of 4 Monday 1st <U+2013> Sunday 7th |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=17 September 2008 |work=Naval-History.net }}</ref> By 8 April, ''Alster'' had reached the [[Bod<U+00F8>]] area, where she was intercepted by the Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Syrian}}, which sent her to Bod<U+00F8>.<ref name=april2>{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4004-13APR02.htm |title=Naval Events, April 1940, Part 2 of 4 Monday 8th - Sunday 14th |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=17 September 2008 |work=Naval-History.net }}</ref><ref>Berg and Vollan 1999, pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref><ref>Haar 2009, pp. 66, 333</ref>

On 16 May a request was made to the [[Admiralty]] for a call sign for ''Alster'', the ship departing Troms<U+00F8> the next day for [[Kirkenes]] in [[Finnmark]], escorted by the [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] whaler {{HMS|Ullswater||6}}. She was despatched to the northern port to retrieve a cargo of iron ore. Arriving on 19 May 1940, ''Alster'' loaded some 10,000 tons of iron ore over four days, sailing south to the port of [[Harstad]] on 22 May, still escorted by HMS ''Ullswater'', as well as the Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Nordhav II}}. On 23 May the British submarine [[HMS Truant (N68)|HMS ''Truant'']] made an unsuccessful attack with two torpedoes on ''Alster'', despite efforts having been made to both keep the cargo ship away from the submarine's patrol area, and to warn ''Truant'' of the ship's identity. The torpedoes missed, exploding when they hit land. ''Alster'' and HMS ''Ullswater'' arrived at Harstad on 26 May, with the escort vessel sailing northwards to [[Hammerfest]] with mail and provisions for the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}.<ref name=1stcruiser/><ref>Haar 2010, p. 263</ref> While ''Alster'' was at Harstad shipping in the town's harbour was repeatedly subjected to attacks by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, the ships being defended by [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters of the [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] operating from [[Bardufoss Air Station]] and anti-aircraft artillery.

In addition to her cargo of iron ore, the ship carried 209 British military personnel, 46 Norwegian military personnel and 72 German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. ''Alster'' arrived at [[Scapa Flow]] on 31 May, unloading her passenger there. Sailing on on 3 June, in the company of the passenger steamer {{SS|St. Magnus|1924|2}} and escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Ashanti|F51|6}} and {{HMS|Bedouin|F67|6}}, she arrived at [[Rosyth]] in Scotland on 4 June 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4005-14MAY04.htm |title=Naval Events, May 1940, Part 4 of 4 Wednesday 22nd <U+2013> Friday  31st |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=17 September 2008 |work=Naval-History.net }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4006-19JUN01.htm |title=Naval Events, June 1940, Part 1 of 4 Saturday 1st <U+2013> Friday 7th |accessdate=8 March 2012 |last=Kindell |first=Don |date=19 April 2009 |work=Naval-History.net }}</ref>
