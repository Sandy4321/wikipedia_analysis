The '''Council for the Affairs of Religious Cults''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0434><U+0435><U+043B><U+0430><U+043C> <U+0440><U+0435><U+043B><U+0438><U+0433><U+0438><U+043E><U+0437><U+043D><U+044B><U+0445> <U+043A><U+0443><U+043B><U+044C><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432>}}) was a government council in the [[Soviet Union]] that dealt with [[Religion in the Soviet Union|religious activity in the country]]. It was established in May 1944.<ref>Ro'i 2000, 11.</ref>   The council, established at the Council of People's Ministers, was set up to oversee all religious confessions aside from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which had its own council, The Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church.  It was also charged with the responsibility of managing relations with non-Christian religions and the Soviet state.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Altnurme |first=Riho |year=2002 |title="Religious Cults." Particularly Luthernaism, in the Soviet Union in 1944-1949 |journal=Trames |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=1}}</ref>  For example, the Soviet Union had discontinued formal diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]] following the installation of the Soviet Government.  The council would have been responsible for responding to the actions of the Holy See, even when the USSR did not officially recognize the Holy See's statehood, and was instrumental in the Soviet campaign against various religious groups, including [[Soviet_Anti-Catholic_Campaigns|Catholicism]].

The membership consisted of members from each Soviet territory and was headed by a chairman and was divided into divisions regarding particular denominations, for example [[Lutheranism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Altnurme |first=Riho |year=2002 |title="Religious Cults."
