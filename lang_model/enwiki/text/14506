:''Not to be confused with [[Anthocyanidin]], their sugar free counterparts.''

'''Anthocyanins''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''{{polytonic|<U+1F00><U+03BD><U+03B8><U+03CC><U+03C2>}} (anthos)'' = flower + ''{{polytonic|<U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>}} (kyanos)'' = blue) are [[solubility|water-soluble]] [[vacuole|vacuolar]] [[pigments]] that may appear red, purple, or blue according to [[pH]]. They belong to a parent class of molecules called [[flavonoids]] synthesized via the [[phenylpropanoid]] pathway. Anthocyanins occur in all [[Biological tissue|tissues]] of higher plants, including [[leaf|leaves]], [[plant stem|stems]], [[root]]s, [[flowers]], and [[fruit]]s. [[Anthoxanthin]]s are their clear, white to yellow counterparts occurring in plants.  Anthocyanins are derivatives of [[anthocyanidins]] which include pendant sugars.

[[Image:JalapenoStemPod.JPG|thumb|left|Anthocyanins provide the purple color of the vertical stripes on stem of this [[Jalape<U+00F1>o]] cultivar.]]
In flowers, bright reds and purples are adaptive for attracting pollinators.  In fruits, the colorful skins also attract the attention of animals, which may eat the fruits and disperse the seeds. In photosynthetic tissues (such as leaves and sometimes stems), anthocyanins have been shown to act as a "sunscreen", protecting cells from high-light damage by absorbing blue-green and UV light, thereby protecting the tissues from [[photoinhibition]], or high-light stress.  This has been shown to occur in red juvenile leaves, autumn leaves, and broad-leaved evergreen leaves that turn red during the winter. It has also been proposed that red coloration of leaves may camouflage leaves from herbivores blind to red wavelengths, or signal unpalatability, since anthocyanin synthesis often coincides with synthesis of unpalatable phenolic compounds.  

In addition to their role as light-attenuators, anthocyanins also act as powerful [[antioxidant]]s. However, it is not clear whether anthocyanins can significantly contribute to scavenging of free-radicals produced through metabolic processes in leaves, since they are located in the vacuole, and thus, spatially separated from metabolic reactive oxygen species. Some studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide produced in other organelles can be neutralized by vacuolar anthocyanin.

Anatomically, anthocyanins are found in the cell vacuole, mostly in flowers and [[fruit]]s but also in [[leaf|leaves]], stems, and [[root]]s. In these parts they are found predominantly in outer cell layers such as the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] and peripheral mesophyll cells.  

Most frequent in nature are the glycosides of [[cyanidin]], [[delphinidin]], [[malvidin]], [[pelargonidin]], [[peonidin]] and [[petunidin]]. Roughly 2% of all [[hydrocarbon]]s fixated in photosynthesis are converted into flavonoids and their derivatives such as the anthocyanins. There is no less than 10<sup>9</sup> tons of anthocyanins produced in nature per year.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}  Not all land plants contain anthocyanin; in the [[Caryophyllales]] (including [[cactus]], [[beet]]s, and [[amaranth]]), they are replaced by [[betalain]]s.

Plants rich in anthocyanins are [[Vaccinium]] species, such as [[blueberry]], [[cranberry]] and [[bilberry]], [[Rubus]] berries including [[black raspberry]], [[red raspberry]] and [[blackberry]], [[blackcurrant]], [[cherry]], [[eggplant]] [[peel (fruit)|peel]], [[black rice]], [[Concord grape]] and [[muscadine grape]], [[red cabbage]] and [[Violet (plant)|violet]] petals. Anthocyanins are less abundant in [[banana]], [[asparagus]], [[pea]], [[fennel]], [[pear]] and [[potato]], and may be totally absent in certain [[cultivar]]s of green [[gooseberries]].<ref name=Wu/>

The highest recorded amount appears to be specifically in the [[seed coat]] of black [[soybean]] (''Glycine max'' L.

Nature, primitive agriculture, and plant breeding have produced various uncommon crops containing anthocyanins, including blue- or red-fleshed potatoes and purple or red broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots and corn.  Tomatoes have been bred conventionally for high anthocyanin content by crossing wild relatives with the common [[tomato]] to transfer a [[gene]] called the anthocyanin fruit tomato ("aft") gene into a larger and more palatable fruit.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14691311 Jones CM, Mes P, Myers JR.

==Autumn leaf color==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
[[Image:Img fagus sylvatica atropurpurea 1890.jpg|thumb|A selected purple-leaf cultivar of [[European Beech]]]]
Plants with abnormally high anthocyanin quantities are popular as [[ornamental plant]]s. 
Many science textbooks incompletely state that [[autumn leaf color|autumn coloration]] (including red) is the result of breakdown of green chlorophyll, which unmasks the already-present orange, yellow, and red pigments ([[carotenoid]]s, [[xanthophyll]]s, and anthocyanins, respectively). While this is indeed the case for the carotenoids and xanthophylls (orange and yellow pigments), anthocyanins are not present until the leaf begins breaking down the chlorophyll, during which time the plant begins to synthesize the anthocyanin, presumably for photoprotection during [[nitrogen translocation]].

===Anthocyanins: Glucosides of anthocyanidins===
The anthocyanins, anthocyanidins with sugar group, are mostly 3-[[glucosides]] of the anthocyanidins.
The anthocyanins are subdivided into the [[sugar]]-free [[anthocyanidin]] [[aglycone]]s and the anthocyanin glycosides. As of 2003 more than 400 anthocyanins had been reported<ref>{{cite journal 
|author=Kong JM, Chia LS, Goh NK, Chia TF, Brouillard R |title=Analysis and biological activities of anthocyanins |journal = [[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]] |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=923<U+2013>33 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14561507 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031942203004382
 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(03)00438-2 }}</ref> while more recent literature (early 2006), puts the number at more than 550 different anthocyanins. The difference in chemical structure that occurs in response to changes in pH is the reason why anthocyanins are often used as [[pH]] [[pH indicator|indicator]], as they change from red in [[acid]]s to blue in [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s.

==Biosynthesis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
[[Image:Blood orange sliced.jpg|thumb|right|Anthocyanins are responsible for the distinctive color of [[blood orange]]s, although [[carotenoid]]s also contribute [[pigment]]ation in this fruit.]]
#Anthocyanin pigments are assembled like all other [[flavonoids]] from two different streams of chemical raw materials in the cell:
#* One stream involves the [[shikimate]] pathway to produce the amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. ''(see [[phenylpropanoid]]s)''
#* The other stream produces 3 molecules of [[malonyl-CoA]], a C3 unit from a C2 unit ([[acetyl-CoA]]).
#These streams meet and are coupled together by the enzyme '''chalcone synthase''' (CHS), which forms an intermediate [[chalcone]] via a [[polyketide]] folding mechanism that is commonly found in plants.
#The chalcone is subsequently isomerized by the enzyme '''chalcone isomerase''' (CHI) to the prototype pigment [[naringenin]].
#Naringenin is subsequently oxidized by enzymes such as '''flavanone hydroxylase''' (FHT or F3H), '''flavonoid 3' hydroxylase''' and '''flavonoid 3' 5'-hydroxylase'''. 
#These oxidation products are further reduced by the enzyme '''dihydroflavonol 4-reductase''' (DFR) to the corresponding leucoanthocyanidins.
#It was believed that leucoanthocyanidins are the immediate precursors of the next enzyme, a dioxygenase referred to  as '''anthocyanidin synthase''' (ANS) or '''leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase''' (LDOX). It was recently shown however that flavan-3-ols, the products of '''leucoanthocyanidin reductase''' (LAR), are the true substrates of ANS/LDOX. 
#The resulting, unstable anthocyanidins are further coupled to sugar molecules by enzymes like '''UDP-3-O-glucosyl transferase''' to yield the final relatively stable anthocyanins. 

More than five enzymes are thus required to synthesize these pigments, each working in concert. Any even minor disruption in any of the mechanism of these enzymes by either genetic or environmental factors would halt anthocyanin production.

==Potential food value==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Anthocyanins are considered [[secondary metabolite]]s as a [[food additive]] with [[E number]] 163.

Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants ''[[in vitro]]''. This antioxidant property may be conserved even after the plant which produced the anthocyanin is consumed by another organism, possibly explaining why fruits and vegetables with colorful skins and pulp are considered nutritious. Research continues to be underway as to the potential range of health benefits from anthocyanins.

Richly concentrated as [[pigments]] in [[berries]], anthocyanins were the topics of research presented at a 2007 symposium on health benefits that may result from berry consumption.<ref name=jafcsymp>[http://pubs.acs.org/journals/jafcau/promo/symposium/berryhealth.html ''Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'' Presents Research from the 2007 International Berry Health Benefits Symposium], ''Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'' ACS Publications, February 2008</ref> Laboratory-based evidence was provided for potential health effects against:

* cancer

Cancer research on anthocyanins is the most advanced, where black [[raspberry]] (''[[Rubus occidentalis]]'' L.) preparations were first used to inhibit chemically induced cancer of the rat [[esophagus]] by 30-60% and of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] by up to 80%.<ref name=jafcsymp/><ref>[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/canberry.htm Stoner GD. Black raspberries show multiple defenses in thwarting cancer, The Ohio State University Research News, undated]</ref> Effective at both the initiation and promotion/progression stages of tumor development, black raspberries are a practical research tool and a promising therapeutic source, as they contain the richest contents of anthocyanins among native North American [[Rubus]] berries.<ref name=Wada/>

Work on laboratory cancer models has shown that black raspberry anthocyanins inhibit promotion and progression of tumor cells by

# stalling growth of pre-[[malignant]] cells
# accelerating the rate of cell turnover, called [[apoptosis]], effectively making the cancer cells die faster
# reducing inflammatory mediators that initiate tumor onset
# inhibiting growth of new blood vessels that nourish tumors, a process called [[angiogenesis]]
# minimizing cancer-induced [[DNA]] damage.
