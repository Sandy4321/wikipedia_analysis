'''Talkin' Devil''' is a talking blues written by singer/songwriter [[Bob Dylan]]. Dylan never recorded it for a studio album, as was the fate of many of his early compositions, but he did record a short demo of the song for the folk magazine ''Broadside'', which was released on the compilation ''Broadside Ballads Vol. 1'' (under the [[pseudonym]] of "Blind Boy Grunt") in 1963.<ref>Williamson, Nigel, "The Rough Guide To Bob Dylan", p. 315</ref> It hasn't been re-relased on any of Dylan's albums since, and is considered a rarity among collectors.
