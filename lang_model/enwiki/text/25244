'''''Rainbow''''' is the seventh [[studio album]] by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]], released on November 2, 1999, by [[Columbia Records]]. The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous album, ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997), in which she began her transition into the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] market. ''Rainbow'' contains a mix of [[hip-hop]]-influenced R&B jams, as well as a variety of slow ballads. On the album, Carey worked with [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]], who replaced [[Walter Afanasieff]], the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s. As a result of her separation from her husband, [[Tommy Mottola]], Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several musicians such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], and [[Snoop Dogg]].

On Carey's previous album, ''Butterfly'', she began incorporating several other genres, including R&B and hip-hop, into her musical repertoire. In order to further push her musical horizons, Carey featured Jay-Z on the album's lead single, the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles. Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R&B than [[Pop music|pop]] for this album, and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as "Crybaby" and "How Much", both of which featured strong R&B beats and grooves.  Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period, including "[[Thank God I Found You]]" (written with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]]) and "After Tonight" (written with Diane Warren), mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life.

Upon release, ''Rainbow'' received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics. While many celebrated Carey's continued musical departure from her [[adult contemporary]] past, some felt the album was not as strong or as distinct as ''Butterfly''. The album debuted at number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]], with first week sales of over 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. ''Rainbow'' was certified triple-[[RIAA certifications|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of over three million copies within the United States. Outside the US, the album debuted atop the charts in France, and within the top five in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. In Europe, ''Rainbow'' was certified [[List of music recording certifications|platinum]] by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), denoting shipments of over one million copies throughout the continent.

Five singles were released from the album: two worldwide international releases, two promotional releases, and one European single. The album's lead single, "[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]", featured Jay-Z. The song became Carey's fourteenth chart topper on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]], and topped the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and Spain. "[[Thank God I Found You]]", featuring [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and [[98 Degrees]], was the second single released from the album. The song peaked atop the chart in the US, becoming Carey's fifteenth song to do so, and achieved moderate international charting. The next two singles, "[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]] and "[[Crybaby (song)|Crybaby]]"<U+2014>featuring Snoop Dogg<U+2014>were released as a [[double A-side]]. The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony due to Sony's alleged weak promotion of the singles. Carey's cover of [[Phil Collins]] "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]" was released in Europe, topping the charts in Ireland and becoming Carey's second chart topper in the United Kingdom.

==Background==
Since her debut in 1990, Carey's career was heavily calculated and controlled by her husband and head of her label [[Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref name="shapiro2">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=91<U+2013>92}}</ref> For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. In January 1995, as she recorded ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences.<ref name="shapiro2"/> She enlisted the production skills and [[Rapping|rap]] styles of [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], who was featured on the remix of her song "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]". While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's influence paid off:<ref name="shapiro2"/> the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling their joint performance one of the pioneering songs of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musical collaborations.<ref name="shapiro3">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=93}}</ref>

During the recording and production of Carey's ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' in 1997, the couple separated, leaving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album.<ref name="shapiro3"/> Following their separation, Carey began working with younger hip-hop and R&B producers and songwriters, aside from her usual work with balladeers [[Walter Afanasieff]] and [[Kenneth Edmonds]].<ref name="shapiro4">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=94}}</ref> While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey's previous releases, ''Butterfly'' also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R&B-infused jams.<ref name="shapiro4"/> While Sony accepted Carey's new collaborations with writers and producers such as [[P. Diddy]] and [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], they contiunued to focus their promotion on the ballads. After "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", the debut single from ''Butterfly'', was released in September 1997, Sony halted the release of the succeeding R&B-influenced jams, and released the ballad "[[My All]]" as the second worldwide single. ''Rainbow'' followed in its predecessors' footsteps, becoming even more drenched in modern hip-hop and R&B.<ref name="shapiro4"/>

During the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony, her ex-husband's label.<ref name="shapiro5">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=121}}</ref> Carey's lover at the time, [[Luis Miguel]], was in the midst of a European tour. In order to spend more time with him, she opted to record the album on the secluded island of [[Capri]], Italy, figuring the seclusion would also help her complete the album sooner.<ref name="shapiro5"/> During this time, Carey's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff, who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career.<ref name="shapiro5"/> Aside from their growing creative differences, Mottola had given Afanasieff more opportunities to work with other artists.<ref name="shapiro6">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=122}}</ref> She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff, in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained.<ref name="shapiro6"/> Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums.<ref name="shapiro6"/> In an interview with ''Blitz TV'', Carey spoke of her decision to record the album in Capri:
<Blockquote>
I love New York. But if I'm there, I want to go out, friends come to the studio, the phone rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, and there is no one I can run into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to effectively finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label'! I couldn't take it. The situation there [Sony] was becoming increasingly difficult.<ref name="shapiro5"/>
</Blockquote>
Like her previous releases, Carey co-wrote and co-produced the album's material, working with several hip-hop and R&B producers such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], and [[Brian Michael Cox]].<ref name="shapiro6"/> For the album's debut single release, Carey collaborated with Jay-Z and DJ Clue.<ref name="bronson">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=888}}</ref> During the spring of 1999, Carey began working with Clue on several [[hook (music)|hooks]] and melodies for the lead single. After a few hours, they decided to include a hip-hop star on the track, which eventually led to Jay-Z.<ref name="bronson"/> Carey's longtime friend and back-up vocalist [[Trey Lorenz]], who was featured on her remake of the [[Jackson 5]] song "[[I'll Be There (Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]]", added "some soft male [back-up] vocals."<ref name="bronson"/> Carey worked with Lewis and Jam on the ballad "[[Thank God I Found You]]".<ref name="bronson2">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=892}}</ref> She had already been in the studio with the duo several times when she contacted them to meet her at the studio, where she told them that she had come up with the title, hook, and melody. Usually, when Carey was writing the songs for ''Rainbow'', James "Big Jim" Wright would play the organ or piano and assist Carey to find the "right melody."<ref name="bronson2"/> However, since Wright was not present, Lewis played the organ while Carey directed him with her [[vocal range|lower registers]], providing the [[chord progression]]. They composed the song and recorded Carey's vocals. Knowing she wanted to introduce a male vocalist on the track, Lewis brought R&B singer [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and pop group [[98 Degrees]] into the studio.<ref name="bronson2"/> After a few hours, the group and Joe had recorded all their vocals and the song was complete.<ref name="bronson2"/> In an interview with Bronson, Lewis discussed the night Carey wrote "Thank God I Found You":
<Blockquote>
It all happened that night. She told us the title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.<ref name="bronson2"/>
</Blockquote>

While the album was immersed further into mainstream R&B territory, Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album, working with writers and producers such as [[David Foster]] and [[Diane Warren]].<ref name="shapiro6"/> The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster, who thought that the two would be able to "hammer out one hell of a ballad" together.<ref name="shapiro6"/> The two wrote and produced the song titled "After Tonight". Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel, describing their romance in Capri. While the song was deemed a success by both parties, they described their working relationship with mixed feelings.<ref name="shapiro6"/> According to Foster, who was involved in the writing session, Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song. He described it as a "give and take relationship"; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey would not like them; she wanted something more intricate and detailed. Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit.<ref name="shapiro6"/> In the end, Foster felt that they worked "well together". After recording the song, Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet.<ref name="shapiro7">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=123}}</ref> However, after recording his verses several times, Foster and Carey realized that the song would not turn out the way they planned.<ref name="shapiro7"/> Foster said the song's key was "too high for him"; the voices did not harmonize well. Carey did not have time to re-record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel's verses.<ref name="shapiro7"/> Miguel, furious over the failed collaboration, later sent a cut-up tape of the demo to Foster. Carey, Warren, and Foster also wrote "[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]", one of the other ballads featured on ''Rainbow''.<ref name="shapiro7"/>

 }}
As with ''Butterfly'', songs for ''Rainbow'' were chosen to solidify Carey's reputation as a multi-genre artist.<ref name="bronson"/> Throughout the first phase of her career, Carey's albums predominantly consisted of pop and adult contemporary ballads. ''Rainbow'' mixed hip hop and R&B-flavored upbeat songs with softer and lyrically intense ballads resembling those that Carey had previously recorded.<ref name="bronson"/> "[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]", Carey's first collaboration with Jay-Z, used a sample from "Attack of the Name Game", recorded by [[Stacy Lattisaw]], as its hook. The loop originated from "The Name Game" by [[Shirley Ellis]];<ref name="bronson"/> Ellis and co-writer [[Lincoln Chase]] are credited as songwriters on the track. Carey incorporated the hook into the song's melody, and added instrumentation.<ref name="bronson"/> Lyrically, the song chronicles the heartbreak the protagonist feels after learning of her lover's infidelity. "[[Thank God I Found You]]" features vocals from Joe and 98 Degrees, as well as songwriting and production from Carey and Lewis.<ref name="bronson2"/> According to Carey, the song reflects on events in her own life at the time, with the lyrics describing the completion the protagonist feels after "finding" their lover. Joe provides the main male vocal throughout each verse, and 98 Degrees sing the background vocals and the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].<ref name="bronson2"/>

Prior to the album's recording, Carey and her sister Allison had a falling out in their relationship.<ref name="shapiro8">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=126<U+2013>127}}</ref> Allison had contracted [[AIDS]] in 1995, and she blamed Carey for many of her problems and heartbreaks throughout the years. Her children were taken away while she received treatment for AIDS and for mental health issues.<ref name="shapiro8"/> Carey wrote a song titled "Petals", which she describes as the most honest lyrics she has ever written. The song tells of Carey's feelings for her sister, while illustrating the pain Allison's betrayal and suffering have caused.<ref name="shapiro8"/> In an interview with Bronson, Carey described the meaning of the lyrics of "Petals":
<Blockquote>
It is a great outlet for me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most personal songs and remains on of my favorites. I think [it had the most] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go hand in hand with the song's composition.<ref name="bronson"/>
</Blockquote>
"After Tonight" was a song Carey wrote with David Foster and Diane Warren. Carey had strong feelings about the song, as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel.<ref name="shapiro11">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref> The song was compared instrumentally to "[[My All]]" from ''Butterfly'', which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation.<ref name="shapiro11"/> In the lyrics, the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her and come back to her "after tonight." Carey's cover of the [[Phil Collins]] song "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]" was originally intended to be a solo ballad. The song was re-done after the album was released, with music by the Irish band [[Westlife]] replacing the song's instrumental bridge.<ref name="shapiro11"/> "[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]" was one of the album's most uplifting ballads, lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners. The message, Carey said, was a personal theme of hers growing up, of not letting others "bring her down" and not allowing them to take away the light inside her.<ref name="shapiro11"/>

==Conflict with Sony==

}}
As with ''Butterfly'' two years earlier, ''Rainbow'' became the center of conflict between Carey and her label.<ref name="shapiro10">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=133<U+2013>134}}</ref> After her divorce from Sony record official and Columbia CEO Tommy Mottola, Carey's working relationship with the label deteriorated. She intended for "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" to be the third single from ''Rainbows'', as it held very personal lyrical content. However, Sony made it clear that they intended the third single should be a more upbeat and urban track.<ref name="shapiro10"/> The difference in opinion led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid-2000, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" on radio stations.<ref name="shapiro10"/> One of the messages Carey left on her page read:
<Blockquote>
Basically, a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.<ref name="shapiro10"/>
</Blockquote>
Carey's actions were given mixed reception, with critics and executives commending her bold actions regarding a song she felt needed to be heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the dispute further.<ref name="shapiro10"/> Soon after, Sony stripped Carey's webpage of messages and began negotiations. Fearing to lose their label's highest seller and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song.<ref name="shapiro10"/> Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart, and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.<ref name="shapiro10"/>

''Rainbow'' garnered mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics. The album's main criticism was its lack of originality, as it failed to improve upon her previous opus, ''Butterfly''.<ref name="shapiro3"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] awarded the album three out of five stars, complimenting it as "the first Carey album where she's written personal lyrics, and allusions to her separation from Mottola."<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rainbow-r443455|title=Rainbow <U+2013> Mariah Carey|last=Erlewine Thomas|first=Stephen|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]. [[All Media Guide]]|accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref> He called the lyrics "true" and "deep", but criticized the lack of originality. Erlewine alluded to ''Rainbow'' as "ballad-heavy" and "repetitious", writing how the album followed the formula of Carey's previous album too precisely. Erlewine ended his review on a mixed note, writing "''Rainbow'' proves that she can still pull off that difficult balancing act, but it's hard not to be a little disappointed that she'd didn't shake the music up a little bit more <U+2013> after all, it would have been a more effective album if the heartbreak, sorrow, and joy that bubbles underneath the music were brought to the surface."<ref name=allmusic/>

Arion Berger, an editor from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', also gave the album three out of five stars. He felt ''Rainbow'' was a genuine R&B and hip-hop album, calling it a "sterling chronicle of the state of accessible hip-hop balladeering at the close of 1999."<ref name=rs>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/rainbow-19991125|title=Mariah Carey Rainbow|last=Berger|first=Arion|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]. [[Limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]]|date=1999-11-25|accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref> Aside from calling the some off the ballads "banal", Berger concluded his review with "''Rainbow'' is at its best<U+2014>and Carey at her most comfortable<U+2014>when urbane hip-hop stylings and faux R&B coexist in smooth middle-of-the-road harmony."<ref name=rs/> Critic [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]''  gave the album a double honorable mention ({{Rating-Christgau|hm2}}), writing "[It's] Not a 'real' r&b thrush, but good enough to fake it."<ref name=rc>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=877|title=Robert Christgau: CG: Mariah Carey|last=Christgau|first=Robert|publisher=RobertChristgau.com|year=1998|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> Amy Linden from ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' was unimpressed with the album, writing "I don't care about it anymore." While complimenting the album's genre influences and  featured musical guests, Linden felt ''Rainbow'' was not original. She concluded her review with "'Rainbow' will garner her even more adoration.

Arion berger from ''Rolling Stone'' called the song Carey's "most insinuating: nasal, silken, declarative, riding the percolating beat."<ref name=rs/> However, while dismissing some of the song's vocals and the incorporation of the hook, he complimented its marriage of pop and hip-hop through Jay-Z's verses.<ref name=rs/> Robert Christgau named the song one of his favorites from ''Rainbow'', calling it "real R&B."<ref name=rc/> The song's music video became one of the most expensive music videos of all time, costing an estimated $2.5 million.<ref name="bronson"/> The video features Carey visiting a movie theater with her friends, where she finds her lover with another woman. "Thank God I Found You" was released as the second worldwide single from the album. While becoming Carey's fifteenth chart topper in the US, the song achieved moderate chart success in Europe and other territories. Berger called it a "gospel soar" and complimented Carey's vocals, as well as the harmonies by 98 Degrees.<ref name=rs/> The music video features footage from a live concert with Carey and the band performing the song.

"[[Crybaby (song)|Crybaby]]" and "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" were released simultaneously as a [[double A-side]], with very limited promotion from Sony.<ref name="shapiro8"/> These two songs, especially the latter, became the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label, due to their alleged low promotion of the album.<ref name="shapiro8"/> "Crybaby" was chosen as one of the album's top songs by Christgau, who called it the album's best attempt at R&B.<ref name=rc/> Carey and Snoop Dogg were featured in the music video for "Crybaby", with Carey playing an anxious woman who can't sleep at night due to her lover's infidelity. A music video for "Can't Take That Away" was released around the same time, which features Carey on a rooftop garden. Carey sings during a rain storm, and towards the video's conclusion, the sun arises, bring forth a "new day". The final single from ''Rainbow'', "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)", was given a limited release as well. After performing moderately around the world, a new version of the song, featuring [[Westlife]], was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom.<ref name="shapiro11"/> It became successful there, peaking at number one in both territories, and became Carey's second UK chart topper.<ref name="shapiro11"/> The song's video features Carey and Westlife on a boat in Capri.
