'''The M<U+00F6>lders'''  family is a fictional family in [[Kaoru Mori]]'s manga [[Victorian Romance Emma]]. There was stated, the M<U+00F6>lders is a German family which settled in a country house in [[Yorkshire]], England. The M<U+00F6>lders family consists of Wilhelm M<U+00F6>lders, his wife Dorothea, their son Erich, and their daughter Ilse.

----
'''Wilhelm M<U+00F6>lders'''
: The head of the M<U+00F6>lders household. A German merchant who moved to England together with his family. He is shown to be fond of his children and having a wide perspectives, in which he once told his son to say 'thank you' even towards servants, "because that is what a gentleman should do". It seems that difference of class doesn't matter to him as much it does to English people at that time. He is a bit ignorant of a person, in which Dorothea always pushes him about the matter of education for their daughter Ilse.

'''Dorothea M<U+00F6>lders'''
: The wife of Wilhelm M<U+00F6>lders. Often acts as a bridge between the M<U+00F6>lders family and the other upper class families, Dorothea frequently goes on parties and dinners on behalf of her husband, accompanied by a servant who takes care of her dresses and make-ups. She is shown to be careless, for she mistakes Emma as her personal assistant Tasha in [[King's Cross Station]] and she takes Emma to her residence in York just because 'that girl seems to get along well with Tasha.' She is a close friend of Mrs. Trollope (later revealed as Aurelia, William's mother). Kaoru Mori personally noted that the role model for Dorothea is the opera singer [[Maria Callas]]

'''Erich M<U+00F6>lders'''
:The first M<U+00F6>lders' child, shown as a boy around 9-10 ten years old. He has a pet squirrel named Theo, and it seems that he likes his pet very much seeing that it frequently accompanies him. Erich speaks no English. In his first meeting with Emma, Theo was stuck in his bedpost's canopy and Emma helped him bringing Theo down although Emma couldn't speak German. Later, Erich expressed his gratitude toward Emma by kissing her on the cheek in front of parents, which surprised them.

'''Ilse M<U+00F6>lders'''
:The youngest child in M<U+00F6>lders household. In the manga, it was stated that Ilse is 5 years old. Ilse is a shy and quiet child yet adorable, so it seems that the servants like her very much. She is shown to inherit her mother's dark hair, and she has a favorite elephant doll, which is probably given by the servants on her birthday party.
