'''Edwin W. Pauley Pavilion''', informally and commonly known as '''Pauley Pavilion''', is an [[list of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] located on the campus of [[UCLA]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It is home to the [[UCLA Bruins]] men's and women's [[basketball]] teams. The men's and women's [[volleyball]] and women's [[gymnastics]] teams also play here. 
The building, designed by architect [[Welton Becket]]<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/27/sports/sp-pauley27 Pauley Pavilion plays catch-up]</ref>, was dedicated in June, 1965, named for [[University of California]] [[Regent]] [[Edwin W. Pauley]], who had matched the alumni contributions. Pauley donated almost one fifth of the more than $5,000,000 spent in building the [[arena]].

==Features==
[[Image:Pauley Pavilion crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Mens Basketball game at Pauley Pavilion on 1/8/05 when UCLA came from 22 down to upset Washington.]]

Pauley Pavilion contains 10,337 permanent theater-style upholstered seats, plus retractable [[bleachers]] for 2,482 spectators, making a total basketball capacity of 12,829. This capacity has been exceeded several times for several men's basketball games by adding portable bleacher seating alongside the retractable bleachers. The single-game attendance record of 13,478 was set on February 23, 1997 (UCLA vs. [[Duke University|Duke]]). 

When the bleachers are retracted, there is space for three full-sized basketball courts. These courts are used for team practice, [[intramural]] games, and pickup basketball games. It can also serve as a convention hall or large dining area when in this configuration.

When used for men's [[volleyball]], the basketball court is striped with colored tape. The volleyball net is erected at the half court line.  The women's team uses blue and yellow Sport Court lined up perpendicularly to the basketball court tucked up  to the east end of the court.

There is a tunnel on the south side through which trucks and service vehicles may enter. This is also the "backstage" entrance for players, performers, and broadcast personnel.

The floor is called "Nell and John Wooden Court" in honor of former UCLA Men's Basketball Coach [[John Wooden]] and his wife Nell.

==UCLA Men's Basketball seating==
From the opening of the building until 1987, the extra press not involved in the radio or television broadcasts sat behind the south side (team bench side) press table. The working press then moved to sit courtside at "press row" on the northern side of the court, as the south courtside seats were opened up to influential and affluent boosters. In 2003, the UCLA Athletic Department made available north side courtside seats to affluent donors. The media now sit higher up in permanent seating dead-center in the north side of the bleachers. The press move to the north side in 1987 was as controversial as the 2003 move, in that the student section was now behind the press table and big donors had taken the south side courtside seats.

The student section has moved several times as well. Since 2003, the student section of 1,750 seats occupies the north side bleachers.

The [[UCLA Marching Band|UCLA Varsity Band]] has also moved to accommodate seating changes. Originally, they were located on the north courtside directly across from the UCLA bench. In 1984, they moved to the northeast corner courtside. In 1996 they moved to the north side above the student section. In 2003, they moved to the west side of the arena to be courtside.

==History==
===1960s===
[[Image:PauleyPavilionExterior.jpg|thumb|right|Pauley Pavilion exterior]]Before the construction of the Pavilion, the on-campus home to the UCLA Bruins men's basketball team was the 2,000 seat [[Men's Gym]], disparagingly known as the "[[Body odor|B. O.]] barn." and currently known as the Student Activities Center.  Games were also played at the [[Pan Pacific Auditorium]], the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] and other venues around Los Angeles. 

Bruin teams coached by [[John Wooden]] won the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] in 1964 and 1965. Fans and Coach Wooden felt that a suitable arena needed to be constructed. The arena was constructed so that there would be some space between the crowds and the action on the court. Coach Wooden cited the example of the close quarters of Harmon Gym (now [[Haas Pavilion]]) where fans would pull leg hairs from his players' legs. [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], then known as Lew Alcindor, was recruited to UCLA partly on the promise of playing in the new arena.

*H.R. Haldeman [Chief on Staff of Nixon White House 1969-1973] headed the campaign to build a state-of-the-art sports arena.  A million dollars was raised, which was matched by a donation from Edwin W. Pauley.

*The building was dedicated to Regent Edwin W. Pauley, at the June 1965 commencement ceremony by UCLA Chancellor [[Franklin D. Murphy]].

*The facility opened for the 1965&ndash;1966 college basketball season. The first game ever played in Pauley Pavilion was on November 27, 1965. It featured the [[College freshman|freshmen]] team, led by Big Lew Alcindor, against the UCLA varsity squad, the two-time defending champions and pre-season No. 1 team. The freshmen defeated the varsity team 75-60, heralding great things to come.<ref>Florence, Mal - Who's No. 1? UCLA Frosh Too Hot for Varsity, 75-60. Los Angeles Times, November 28, 1965. Quote:''Lew Alcindor strode onto the Pauley Pavilion court Saturday night and captured the town, completely demoralizing the UCLA varsity basketball team in the process.''</ref>

*[[Ohio State]] was the first visiting team in the regular season. The varsity Bruins defeated the Buckeyes in the inaugural game 92-66.

*Pauley Pavilion hosted its first NCAA Regional Finals in the 1969 post-season. The Bruins advanced from there to win the 1969 Championship.

===1970s===
*John Wooden coached what would be his final game as varsity head coach in Pauley Pavilion March 1, 1975 in a 93-59 victory over [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. Four weeks later he would surprisingly announce his retirement following the NCAA semi-final victory against [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] and before his 10th National championship victory against [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]]. The Bruins won 149 games to 2 losses at home between 1965 and 1975. Bruin men's basketball teams won 8 more NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships from 1967 through 1975 under Coach Wooden. 

*UCLA's longest winning streak in men's basketball at Pauley Pavilion was 98 games. It ended on February 21, 1976, when Oregon defeated UCLA, 65-45.

*The 1978 [[AIAW]] Women's Basketball Championship Final Four was hosted at Pauley Pavilion. UCLA defeated the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] 90-74 to win their first Women's basketball championship in front of a crowd of 9,531.

===1980s===
[[Image:UCLA USC Volleyball game 08.jpg|thumb|UCLA vs. USC volleyball 2008]]
*The first [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship]] was held at Pauley Pavilion in 1981, with UCLA falling to [[University of Southern California|USC]] in the title match.

*The building was host to the [[1984 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. It was the third championship since the NCAA championship took precedence over the AIAW championship. The USC Trojan women's basketball team defeated the [[University of Tennessee]] Lady Vols 72-61.

*In the 1985 post-season, the Bruins hosted their first [[National Invitation Tournament]] ([[NIT]]) tournament games under coach [[Walt Hazzard]]. The Bruins won all three and advanced to the finals to win the [[1985 National Invitation Tournament]]. In November 1985 at the intrasquad game, a banner was added in a ceremony commemorating the tournament championship. The banner was the same size and style as the NCAA championship banners. This banner subsequently was removed to make room for the 1995 National Championship banner.

*The [[1987 Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]], the  first [[Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]], was played in Pauley Pavilion in the 1987 post-season. The Bruins were the first tournament champions.

*The 1987 [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship]] was held in Pauley Pavilion. UCLA defeated USC 3 - 0 to win the title.

*On June 28, 1987, John Wooden and [[Dean Smith]] coached against each other in an exhibition basketball game featuring alumni from both schools. <ref>Mike Downey - North Carolina Beats UCLA in Alumni Game, 116-111. Los Angeles Times. June 29, 1987</ref>

*In the 1989&ndash;1990 season, the building was celebrated in "25 years of Pauley". A book, ''Pauley Pavilion: College Basketball's Showplace'' by David Smale, was released commemorating the great teams that played there as well as great moments in the history of the building. The first jersey numbers of outstanding players were retired and displayed in the building (see below).

===1990s===
*The venue played host to the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

*In 1995 the Bruins won their eleventh NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, this time under coach [[Jim Harrick]].

*On October 14, 1995, the first day of practice after UCLA won its eleventh national championship in basketball, the UCLA Men's and Women's Basketball teams held UCLA's first - and heretofore only - Midnight Madness ceremony. (In NCAA rules before the 2005 season, practices could not begin until midnight of the first day. Many schools would use this as an opportunity to build support for their teams by beginning the season publicly at the first possible minute.)

===2000s===
*Former UCLA coach John Wooden and his late wife were honored on [[December 20]], [[2003]] when the basketball floor at Pauley Pavilion was named "Nell & John Wooden Court." Since his retirement, Coach Wooden has been a fixture at UCLA Men's Basketball games.

*The pavilion has played host to the numerous annual [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]], including the 21st show on Saturday, March 29, 2008, with UCLA alum [[Jack Black]] as host.

*The 2001 ''[[Jeopardy! College Championship]]'' was taped at Pauley Pavilion (November 7 through 20, 2001). Vinita Kailasanath (Stanford University) was the winner. Jayce Newton represented UCLA. 

*University officials began plans for a $110 million renovation to be completed in 2010, on Coach Wooden's 100th birthday. The university has formed a committee, including Honorary Chair [[John Wooden]], to assist in design and funding of the renovated arena.

*[[The Who]] were honored at the [[Vh1 rock honors|2008 VH1 Rock Honors]] ceremony at the Pauley Pavilion instead of the usual [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The concert consisted of an hour-long performance by the band as well as tributes by [[Incubus]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Flaming Lips]], [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Tenacious D]].<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?id=1588618 VH1.com Rock Honors 2008 Tribute Performers Video Playlist]</ref>.

==UCLA Championship banners==
[[Image:Pauley Pavilion.jpg|thumb|right|Pauley Pavilion, 2004 - six men's championship banners are visible]]
The only championship banners that are displayed within the building are for national or [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championships. Unlike most schools, there are neither conference championship banners nor other tournament championship banners displayed in the building, despite the fact UCLA teams have won many tournaments and basketball championships in the Pacific Ten Conference and its predecessor conferences. Former Bruin point guard [[Jordan Farmar]] described the rationale for this during the Bruins' 2005 [[Final Four]] run, by stating, "[a]t UCLA, only national championship banners go up."  The men's banners are navy blue with gold lettering, while the women's banners are gold with navy blue lettering.

There is one banner for the women's basketball [[AIAW]] championship in 1978. There are 11 individual banners for the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] teams. There are two banners for volleyball, one for the 19 [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship|men's NCAA volleyball championships]] and one for the three [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA women's volleyball championships]] and three [[AIAW Champions|AIAW championships]].  There are two banners for gymnastics, one for the two [[NCAA Men's Gymnastics championship|men's NCAA gymnastics champions]] and one for the five [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics championship|NCAA women's gymnastics champions]]. The volleyball and gymnastics banners list all the years in which Bruin teams were NCAA or National champions.

==Numbers of retired players==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: Wooden_players.jpg|right|thumb|John Wooden (center) with former Bruins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton.]]  -->On February 3, 1990 in a ceremony in Pauley Pavilion, the first four UCLA basketball player jersey numbers were retired. This was the key moment in the "Pauley at 25" celebration of twenty-five years of the arena. The primary criteria for being chosen was that all four players were three-time All-Americans.<ref name="mediaguide" >UCLA Men's Basketball Media Guide</ref> The honorees were: 

*[[Ann Meyers]] (as Ann Meyers-Drysdale) #15 
*[[Denise Curry]] #12

==Significant events==
[[Image:Pauley Pavilion, exterior.JPG|thumb|Pauley Pavilion from Drake Stadium]]
Pauley Pavilion has been the venue for many other sports championships, concerts, commencement ceremonies and political events. 

Concert performers have included [[Bob Marley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmarley.in/read_concert.php?id=219|title= UCLA, Pauley Pavillion, Los Angeles, California, USA Survival tour 1979,  23 november. |accessdate=2008-10-21}}</ref> [[Bad Religion]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Eric Clapton]], the [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Phish]].

In 1970, [[Frank Zappa]] appeared with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] performing Zappa's orchestral music. [[Zubin Mehta]] directed the orchestra in what would become the soundtrack for Zappa's movie [[200 Motels]]. Frank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention recorded [[Just Another Band from L.A.]] in Pauley Pavilion in 1972.

In 1984, it was the Los Angeles venue for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] Men's and Women's [[Gymnastics]] and Women's [[Artistic Gymnastics]] events. [[Mary Lou Retton]] became the first Olympic [[gymnast]] outside of [[Eastern Europe]] ever to have won the Olympic all-around title.

On April 26, 1986, a birthday tribute for actress/comedienne [[Carol Burnett]] was held inside. Singer [[Neil Diamond]] performed ''[[Sweet Caroline]]'' in her honor.

Two years later in 1988, it was the site of a [[United States presidential election debates|presidential election debate]] between [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]. Dukakis also held his final [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|election]]-eve rally here, hosted by the UCLA Bruin Democrats.

In 1994, composer [[Henry Mancini]], having learned he had [[Terminal illness|terminal]] [[cancer]], gave his last concert at Pauley Pavilion.

In 2009, [[UCLA Spring Sing]] made it's Pauley Pavilion return on May 8th, having switched from the smaller [[Los Angeles Tennis Center]] to this much larger venue due to it's popularity and overwhelming demand.

Almost every year since it's inception, the [[Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards]] have been held on the Nell and [[John Wooden]] court.

==Proposed renovation==

As Pauley Pavilion was turning 40 years old, talk intensified about a possible major renovation of the facility ([http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/24/sports/sp-pauley24 Los Angeles Times, 2005]).  Narrowness of the concourses for spectators to walk around the arena, limited food services and restrooms, the lack of luxury boxes, and a floor configuration that keeps some seating sections distant from the floor have been cited by various observers as areas needing improvement.

According to a 2008 [http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2008/jun/23/guerrero-begins-pauley-renovation/ article] in the UCLA [[Daily Bruin]], "UCLA initially announced the project Jan. 11, 2007, when it hoped to have construction completed by legendary basketball coach John Wooden<U+2019>s 100th birthday, Oct. 14, 2010. Since that announcement, the project has moved slowly, as UCLA has sought to raise funds for the project."

The cost of the renovation was once estimated to be $110 million, but now, a final estimate will await the development of the architectural plans.  The Bruin article also notes that, "a 2012 completion date is now most likely," with the prospect of UCLA basketball games having to move off-campus for one year.
