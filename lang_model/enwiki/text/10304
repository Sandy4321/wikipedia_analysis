'''William Henry Leonard Poe''', often referred to as '''Henry Poe''', ([[January 30]], [[1807]] <U+2013> [[August 1]], [[1831]]) was a sailor, amateur poet and the older brother of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and Rosalie Poe.

After the death of their parents, the three Poe children were split up: Henry lived with family in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], while Edgar and Rosalie were cared for by two different families in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Before the age of 20, Henry traveled around the globe by sea before returning to Baltimore and becoming a published poet and author. One of his works, "The Pirate", was a fictionalized account of his brother's relationship with [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] in Richmond. Henry died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1831 at the age of twenty-four.

Henry Poe was an inspiration to his brother's life and writings and the two had similar writing styles. Edgar Allan Poe for a time used the alias "Henri Le Rennet", a name inspired by Henry. Henry's influence on Edgar's writing include a character in the novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' and the name of the title character in the poem "[[Lenore]]".

Henry kept in touch with his younger brother Edgar sporadically as they grew up, often through letters but once he even visited Edgar in Richmond in the 1820s.<ref name=Meyers61/> There, Edgar introduced his brother to his childhood sweetheart, [[Sarah Elmira Royster]].<ref>Silverman, Kenneth.

In one letter, dated [[November 1]], [[1824]], Allan apologized that Edgar was slow in writing a letter to Henry, complaining that his foster-son "had little else to do, for he does nothing... The boy possesses not a Spark of affection for us, not a particle of gratitude for all my care and kindness towards him."<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 19<U+2013>20. ISBN 0815410387</ref>

Before the age of twenty, Henry served in South America and elsewhere on board the [[USS Macedonian (1810)|USS ''Macedonian'']].<ref name=Silverman37>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 37. ISBN 0060923318</ref> As a crewman aboard the ''Macedonian'', a [[frigate]], he also visited the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and Russia. In 1827, he returned to Baltimore to live with his grandmother, his aunt Maria Clemm, and his two cousins Henry Clemm and [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]].<ref name=Sova193/> Around this time, Henry was described as a "slim, feeble, young man with dark inexpressive eyes" who possessed a "singular personal beauty".<ref>Silverman, Kenneth.

=== Writings ===
In Baltimore, while working at a law office, Henry developed his interest in writing. He wrote verse inspired by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] into the albums of local young women and gave recitations.<ref>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 83. ISBN 0060923318</ref> The [[May 19]], [[1827]], issue of Baltimore's ''North American, or, Weekly Journal of Politics, Science, and Literature'' published Henry's "Dreams", a poems which laments the difference between the dream world and reality.<ref>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 73.

Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 84. ISBN 0060923318</ref>

One of Henry's poems, titled "Original", was virtually identical to one of Edgar's early poems published in ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', now known as "The Happiest Day, The Happiest Hour".<ref name=Silverman84/> Edgar wrote "The Happiest Day, The Happiest Hour" while he was serving in the Army. He sent the poem to Henry, who had it published in the [[September 15]], [[1827]], issue of the ''North American''.<ref>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 103<U+2013>104. ISBN 081604161X</ref> Henry's poems generally have themes of melancholy, despair, and feature women who die and abandon their loved ones who dream of their reunion. Many are so similar to Poe's early work that they may have been collaborative efforts.<ref name=Silverman85>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 85. ISBN 0060923318</ref>

== Influence ==
Edgar Allan Poe was very close to his brother, as he wrote: "there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother - it is not so much that they love one another as that they both love the same parent."<ref>Kopley, Richard and Kevin J. Hayes. "Two verse masterworks: 'The Raven' and 'Ulalume'", ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002: 194. ISBN 0521797276</ref> Edgar occasionally used the alias "Henri Le Rennet", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story.<ref name=Silverman37/> The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' (1836) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking.<ref>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 135. ISBN 0060923318</ref> Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem "[[Lenore]]".<ref>Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. Harper Perennial, 1991: 202-203. ISBN 0060923318</ref>
