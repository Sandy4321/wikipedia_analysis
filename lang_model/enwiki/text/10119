'''James Addison Reavis''' (May 10, 1843 &ndash; November 27, 1914), later using the name '''James Addison Peralta-Reavis''', the so-called '''Baron of Arizona'''{{#tag:ref|While Reavis was commonly referred to as "Baron", he never used the term himself.  He instead used the term "Barony" when referring to his claim as a means of emphasizing his wife's supposed noble lineage.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Powell | first = Donald M. | title = The "Baron of Arizona" Self-Revealed: A letter to His Lawyer | journal = Arizona and the West | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 161-73 | date = Summer 1959 }}</ref>|group="Note"}}, was an [[United States|American]] [[forger]] and [[fraudster]].  He is best known in association with the Peralta land grant, also known as the Barony of Arizona, a pair of fraudulent [[land claim]]s that if certified would have granted him ownership to over {{convert|18600|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3|lk=on}} of land in central [[Arizona Territory]] and western [[New Mexico Territory]].<!--maximum claim dimensions were 236.4921 by 78.8307 miles--><ref name="Wagoner 274">Wagoner p. 274</ref>  During the course of the fraud, Reavis collected an estimated US$5,300,000 in cash an promissory notes through the sale of [[Quitclaim deed|quitclaims]] and proposed investment plans.<ref name="Cockridge 150">Cockridge p. 150</ref>

Under the terms of [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] and [[Gadsden Purchase]], the United States was required to recognize and honor existing [[land grant]]s made by either the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] or [[Mexico|Mexican]] governments.<ref name="Wagoner 271">Wagoner p. 271</ref>  Reavis utilized this provision by manufacturing a fictional claim and recipient and then generating a collection of documents demonstrating how the claim came into his possession.  In his first claim, Reavis gained title to the grant via a series of [[Conveyancing|conveyances]].  When serious challenges to this claim developed, Reavis developed a second claim wherein he married the supposed last surviving [[lineal descendant]] of the original claim recipient.

During the course of his deception, Reavis managed to convince a number of prominent people to support his efforts.  He obtained legal and political support from [[Roscoe Conkling]], [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], and [[James Broadhead]].  Business leaders such as [[Charles Crocker]] and [[John W. Mackay]] in turn provided financial support.  Initial exposure of the fraud occurred when an unfavorable Surveyor General report caused the claim to be summarily dismissed.  In response to this action, Reavis [[lawsuit|sued]] the U.S. government for US$11,000,000 in damages.  The suit in turn prompted the U.S. government to perform a detailed investigation which fully exposed the forgeries that Reavis had planted in a variety of locations.

==Early life==
Reavis was born the second of five children to Mary (Dixon) and Fenton George Reavis on May 10, 1843 in [[Henry County, Missouri]] near the town of [[Clinton, Missouri |Clinton]].  His father was a [[Welsh people|Welshman]] who had immigrated to the United States in the early 1820s.<ref name="Cockridge 25">Cockridge p. 25</ref>  His mother was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] decent and proud of her Spanish heritage.<ref name="Cockridge 26">Cockridge p. 26</ref>  The family lived on a small farm and also owned a small [[Tanning|tannery]].<ref name="Cockridge 27">Cockridge p. 27</ref>  Reavis received little formal education, but his mother read Spanish [[Romanticism|Romantic literature]] to him and he developed a grandiose and eloquent writing pattern.<ref name="Cockridge 29">Cockridge p. 29</ref>  In 1857, the family sold their farm and moved to Montevallo, Missouri where they opened a store.<ref name="Powell 13">Powell p. 13</ref>

Following the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Reavis enlisted in Hunter's Regiment of the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]], 8th Division of the Missouri State Guard.  Several months later he went to [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] and reenlisted in Captain Lowe's company.<ref name="Powell 13"/>  Initially holding dreams of glory, the 18-year old Reavis soon discovered the realities of military life did not live up to his romanticized ideals.<ref name="Cockridge 35-6">Cockridge p. 35-6</ref>  About this time he also discovered by accident that he could accurately reproduce his commanding officer's signature.<ref name="Powell 13-4">Powell p. 13-4</ref>  Using this new found skill he began to produce [[Pass (United States military)|passes]] to avoid the drudgery of army life and instead spend time visiting his mother.<ref name="Powell 14">Powell p. 14</ref><ref name="Cockridge 37">Cockridge p. 37</ref>  When his fellow soldiers began noticing the frequency and manner in which he was obtaining passes, Reavis began selling forged passes to them.<ref name="Cockridge 37"/>

When some of his superiors became suspicious of Reavis, obtained [[Leave (U.S. military)|leave]] to get married.<ref name="Cockridge 37-8">Cockridge p. 37-8</ref>  Instead of getting married, he surrendered to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces.  Following his surrender, Reavis joined the [[Union Army]] and briefly served in an artillery regiment.  Following the war, he traveled to [[Brazil]] and gained functional fluency in Portuguese.<ref name="Powell 14"/>

Reavis returned to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] near the end of 1866.<ref name="Cockridge 39">Cockridge p. 39</ref>  There he worked in a series of jobs including streetcar conductor, traveling salesman, and as a clerk at a variety of retail stores.  Eventually Reavis found success as a real estate agent.  After several small real estate deals he had saved some money and opened his own office.<ref name="Powell 14"/>  After opening his office, Reavis discovered that the skills he had learned forging army passes also allowed him to adjust real estate paperwork and correct imperfect [[Title (property)|property titles]].<ref name="Powell 15">Powell p. 15</ref>  An example of this was when he aided a man seeking to purchase a track of land near St. Louis.  Three generations of documents accumulated by the selling family were not enough to establish clear title for the land.  Reavis was able to produce a yellowed and fading 18th century document that all previous searches had failed to notice.  Accepted as valid by all parties to the transaction, this document allowed his client to complete the transaction.<ref name="Cockridge 41-2">Cockridge p. 41-2</ref>

==George Willing==
Reavis met [[George M. Willing Jr.]] in 1871.<ref name="Powell 15"/>  Willing was a physician turned prospector who supplemented his income by selling [[patent medicine]].<ref name="Cockridge 48-50">Cockridge p. 48-50</ref>  He came to the real estate agent upon the recommendation of Colonel Byser, a previous customer of Reavis, seeking assistance with real estate purchase.<ref name="Cockridge 46">Cockridge p. 46</ref>  According to Willing, he had purchased the rights to a large Spanish [[land grant]] from Miguel Peralta for US$20,000 in gold dust, prospecting equipment, and saddle mules.  The transaction had occurred at a simple mining site in Black Canyon, southeast of [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott, Arizona Territory]] without the usual documentation.  As Willing explained, "When the trade was made, I had no paper on which to write the deed, so I scoured the camp and found a sheet of greasy, pencil-marked camp paper upon which I wrote ... and as there were no justices or notaries present I had it acknowledged before witnesses."<ref name="Powell 16">Powell p. 16</ref> The deed of transfer was dated October 20, 1864.<ref name="Powell 20">Powell p. 20</ref>
[[File:Cover of 1748 Peralta grant cedula.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of Royal {{lang|es|''cedula''}} (decree) initially establishing the Peralta grant.]]

By the time Willing reached Prescott to record the transaction, it was 1867.<ref name="Cockridge 14">Cockridge p. 14</ref>  He was short of funds at the time of his arrival and offered to sell a half interest in the claim to the local stable owner.<ref name="Powell 17-8">Powell p. 17-8</ref>  Willing suggested that the two of them could reap a sizable profit by selling nearby mines back to their owners.  The stable owner was incensed by the offer and the local townsfolk were soon unfriendly to Willing.  Fearing for his well being, Willing quickly settled his bills and left the next morning with a government surveying team destined for [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].<ref name="Powell 18">Powell p. 18</ref><ref name="Cockridge 15-6">Cockridge p. 15-6</ref>

Reavis suggested Willing leave his documents to allow the real estate agent time to inspect them.  Willing declined the offer and instead returned the next day with an expert in Spanish land titles, William W. Gitt.<ref name="Cockridge 47">Cockridge p. 47</ref>  Known as the "Old Spanish Land Title Lawyer" following a series of dubious land deals in Illinois and Missouri,  Gitt had recently returned to St. Loius.<ref name="Powell 19">Powell p. 19</ref> The previous two decades he had lived in [[Guadalajara, Mexico]] after an 1847 land claim [[lawsuit]] had resulted in a [[bench warrant]] being issued in in the lawyer's name.<ref name="Powell 152-3">Powell p. 152-3</ref>  

The three men began to meet for several hour each week to examine the grant paperwork.<ref name="Cockridge 48">Cockridge p. 48</ref>  In addition to the deed between Willing and Peralta there was an {{lang|es|''expendiente''}}, a copy of the legal papers relating to the Peralta grant.  Accompanying the copies was a letter dated 1853 and bearing the signature of Mexican President [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]] claiming a diligent search had been performed to locate all related documents and that the {{lang|es|''expendiente''}} established secure title of the grant.<ref name="Powell 19"/>  Reavis used this time and his association with Gitt to learn about Mexican and Spanish land documents.<ref name="Powell 20"/>  Reavis also developed a friendship with Willing's wife, Mary Ann, whom the young real estate agent came to regard as a second mother.<ref name="Cockridge 52">Cockridge p. 52</ref>

After a couple years, Reavis and Willing decided to form a partnership aimed at promoting the claim.  The plan was for the two men to travel separately, allowing Willing to retain Reavis upon his arrival as an expert in real estate law.<ref name="Myers">{{Cite journal | last = John Myers | first = Myers | authorlink = John Myers Myers | title = The Prince of Swindlers | journal = [[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 28-31+ | date = August 1956 | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1956/5/1956_5_28.shtml }}</ref>  Willing left with the paperwork in January 1874, taking the overland route to Arizona Territory.  Reavis in turn was to travel by water to [[California]] via [[Panama]].<ref name="Cockridge 54">Cockridge p. 54</ref>  During his journey, Reavis was to visit Florin Massol, a [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] merchant with whom Willing had left papers assigning mining rights within the Peralta grant as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] against a loan.<ref name="Cockridge 53">Cockridge p. 53</ref>

Reavis married Ada Pope of Montevallo, Missouri on May 5, 1874.<ref name="Cockridge 54"/>  The couple had known each other since the days when Reavis' family operated their store.<ref name="Cockridge 41">Cockridge p. 41</ref>  Following a brief honeymoon, he departed for the west and the couple did not see each other again for over six years.<ref name="Powell 21-2">Powell p. 21-2</ref>  Dissatisfied with the state of their marriage, she received a divorce on grounds of desertion in 1883.<ref name="Cockridge 41"/>

==Establishing the grant==
In March 1874, Willing arrived in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] and filed his claim in the [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]] Courthouse.<ref name="Ruffner">{{Cite news | last = Ruffner | first = Budge | title = 'Baron Of Arizona' Had Quite A Scheme | newspaper = The Courier | location =Prescott, Arizona | pages = 8 | date = September 10, 1982 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OLonAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wUwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5365,6280220 }}</ref>  The next morning he was found dead.<ref name="Powell 21">Powell p. 21</ref>  No official investigation as to the cause of Willing's death was ever performed.<ref name="Wagoner 272">Wagoner p. 272</ref>   Suggested causes include poison,<ref name="Myers"/>  "exposure and privation",<ref name="Wagoner 272"/> or simply "strange and unwitnessed circumstances".<ref name = "Ruffner"/>  Reavis learned of his partner's death upon his arrival in [[San Francisco]].  He had expected a bundle of correspondence awaiting his arrival, but instead found only two letters.  The first, from Willing, announcing the doctor's safe arrival in Prescott and the second, informing Reavis of Willing's death, from the Yavapai County sheriff who had sent a letter to the only address in the doctor's papers.<ref name="Cockridge 58">Cockridge p. 58</ref>

In order to continue with the planned scheme, Reavis needed to papers that had been in Willing's possession.  He did not however proceed immediately to Arizona Territory.  In poor health from the journey and in need of funds, Reavis worked as a schoolteacher in [[Downey, California]] during 1875 and 1876.  He then worked as a journalist in [[Northern California]], serving as a correspondent for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' and ''[[San Francisco Call]]'' with occasional work for a [[New York City]] paper.<ref name="Powell 22">Powell p. 22</ref>  As a result of his work at these papers, Reavis became acquainted with railroad tycoons [[Collis Huntington]] and [[Charles Crocker]].<ref name="Cockridge 79-81">Cockridge p. 79-81</ref>  He was also able to observe the operation of the [[Public Land Commission]].  At the time the commission had approved over 500 of the 800 claims presented to it, even frivolous claims were considered as long as examination expenses were payed by the filer, and bribery was a commonly accepted practice.  Assuming that practices in Arizona Territory were similar to those in California gave Reavis great hope for confirmation of the Peralta grant.<ref name="Cockridge 61">Cockridge p. 61</ref>

Reavis' first visit to Arizona Territory came with a May 1880 trip to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref name="Cockridge 1">Cockridge p. 1</ref>  There, posing as a subscription agent for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', he toured the area and even made a trip out to the confluence of [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt]] and [[Gila River|Gila]] rivers.<ref name="Wagoner 272"/><ref name="Cockridge 13">Cockridge p. 13</ref>  From Phoenix, Reavis took a stagecoach to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]].<ref name="Powell 24">Powell p. 24</ref>  Upon his arrival in the territorial capital, he made inquiries into Dr. Willing's death. After locating the probate judge who had overseen the case, Reavis presented a letter from Willing's widow authorizing him to take custody of any papers that had been in Willing's possession.<ref name="Powell 25">Powell p. 25</ref>  A search by the probate judge located Willing's possessions, allowing Reavis to gain control of the Peralta grant paperwork.<ref name="Powell 25-6">Powell p. 25-6</ref>  After completing this business, Reavis returned to California.<ref name="Powell 26">Powell p. 26</ref>

[[File:Map of Peralta land grant.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The Peralta land grant in its final form]]

Under Willing the grant had been a "floater", a grant for a certain amount of territory but lacking a fixed location. Such grants, while common, were useful as legal nuisances capable of scaring an unsophisticated land owner but of little real value.<ref name="Myers" /><ref name="Cockridge 86">Cockridge p. 86</ref> Reavis decided to change this situation and fixed the location of the grant.  To deal with historical ambiguities with various measurements, he choose the definitions most advantageous to his goals.  As a result, the grant for a 10&nbsp;[[League (unit)|league]] by 30&nbsp;league area turned into a territory running {{convert|49.5|mi|km}} miles north to south and {{convert|149.5|mi|km}} miles east to west.<ref name="Myers"/>  The size later grew to {{convert|78.8307|x|236.4921|mi|km|sigfig=3}}<ref name="Wagoner 274"/>  With the center of its western boundary set near the confluence of the Salt and Gila rivers, the grant ended up containing the towns of Phoenix, [[Globe, Arizona|Globe]], [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]], [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]], and [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] and stretching to the outskirts of [[Silver City, New Mexico]].  Other points of interest within the grant boundaries were the [[Silver King Mine]] and a section of the Southern Pacific railroad.<ref name = "Ruffner"/>

To achieve his new vision, Reavis had to first clear some outstanding business issues and obtain additional documentation.<ref name="Cockridge 85-6">Cockridge p. 85-6</ref>  His first step was to visited the family of Florin Massol were, in July 1881, he obtained a release of the mining rites that Willing had signed over.  In exchange Reavis signed a contract that promised to pay US$3000 plus interest to the Florins on the condition that the Peralta grant be confirmed.<ref name="Powell 26-7">Powell p. 26-7</ref>  Additionally Florin Masol, utilizing a power of attorney, signed over Willings' interest in the grant over to Reavis<ref name="Myers"/>  From California, Reavis traveled to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].  The record book for [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]], which had been sent to [[Philadelphia]] for the [[Centennial Exposition]], was at the time in [[Washington, D.C.]] pending its return to [[Jean-Baptiste Salpointe|Bishop Salpointe]].  While in Washington, Reavis obtained permission to examine the book in detail.<ref name="Powell 27">Powell p. 27</ref>

After examining the San Xavier record book, Reavis traveled to [[Mexico]] where between September to November 1881 he searched the archives in [[Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]] for information related to the Peralta grant.  In Mexico he resumed role of a newspaper corespondent looking for items of interest to Los Angeles and San Francisco readers.<ref name="Powell 27" />  He also cultivated friendships with the archivists in both cities, relationships that enabled him to gain easy access to the materials he was interested in inspecting.<ref name="Cockridge 88">Cockridge p. 88</ref>  By the time he left Mexico, Reavis had a collection of photographs and certified copies of papers related to Peralta grant.<ref name="Powell 28">Powell p. 28</ref>  From Mexico, Reavis traveled to see Mary Ann Willing who was then living in [[Kentucky]].  During his visit, on May 1, 1882, the widow signed over her interest in the grant for US$30,000 payed over time.<ref name="Powell 28" />

===First Baron of Arizona===
Contained within the collection of papers that Reavis had collected was the story of the Peralta grant's creation and the life history of the first and second Baron of Arizona.  The story began with the birth of Don Miguel Nemecio Silva de Peralta de la C<U+00F3>rdoba in 1708 to Don Jos<U+00E9> Gaston Silva y Carrillo de Peralta de las Falces de Mendoza and Do<U+00F1>a Francisca Maria de Garcia de la C<U+00F3>rdoba y Mu<U+00F1>iz de Perez.<ref name="Powell 29">Powell p. 29</ref>  Don Miguel entered the service of the King of Spain in 1727 as a lieutenant of [[dragoon]]s.  In 1742, he was appointed {{lang|es|''visitador del rey''}}, a royal inspector, and sent on a secret mission to Guadalajara in [[New Spain]].<ref name="Cockridge 91">Cockridge p. 91</ref>  Papers confirming Don Miguel's appointment named him as Baron of Arizonaca, [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]], and member of the [[Order of Montesa]].<ref name="Powell 29" />

[[File:Don Miguel Nemecio Silva de Peralta de la Cordoba.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of Don Miguel Nemecio Silva de Peralta de la Cordoba, the fictional 1st Baron of Arizona]]  

The exact nature of the royal emissary's mission was never revealed, but may have involved leaked information about claims of silver being found in the region of northern Sonora.<ref name="Powell 30">Powell p. 30</ref>  Apparently pleased with the results however, Philip V issued a royal {{lang|es|''cedula''}} (decree) stating the royal intention make a land grant to Don Miguel in November 1744.<ref name="Powell 30" /><ref name="Cockridge 93">Cockridge p. 93</ref>  Philip's {{lang|es|''cedula''}} was not acted upon until December 20, 1748 when [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] promoted Don Miguel to captain of dragoons, bestowing the title Baron of the Colorados upon him, and issued another {{lang|es|''cedula''}} instructing the Viceroy of New Spain to locate a suitable track containing 300 square [[League (unit)|leagues]] of land.<ref name="Powell 31">Powell p. 31</ref>

It was not until January 3, 1758 that a suitable tract of land north of [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] was located and a decree issue by the Viceroy,[[Agust<U+00ED>n de Ahumada]], granting Don Miguel the land.<ref name="Powell 32">Powell p. 32</ref>  The ceremony to physically locate and mark the claim occurred in May 1758.  Don Miguel traveled to the claim's location accompanied by a priest from San Xavier and two officers from the Viceroy's garrison.<ref name="Cockridge 96">Cockridge p. 96</ref>  The priest served as [[adjudicator]] while the officers acted as witnesses and surveyors.<ref name="Cockridge 96-8">Cockridge p. 96-8</ref> During the ceremony a large rock located on top of a hill, which they name the "Inicial Monument", was spotted and chosen to mark the center of the properties western boundary.<ref name="Powell 34">Powell p. 34</ref>

Following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits from New Spain]] in 1768, Don Miguel sent a request to [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] for reconfirmation of his grant.<ref name="Cockridge 98-9">Cockridge p. 98-9</ref><ref name="Powell 34"/>  The request was granted in 1776, an unusually long delay even accounting for bureaucratic processing and travel times of the day, in the form of a letter reading "I, the King of Spain, gratefully acknowledge your many valuable services in the army of the crown, and approve the grant to you which you have above described."<ref name="Powell 35">Powell p. 35</ref>

Don Miguel made one attempt to settle on his land, using the ruins at [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande]] as his base of operation.  The attempt was unsuccessful due to persistent raids from [[Apache]].<ref name="Powell 35" />   After the failed attempt, Don Miguel returned to Mexico were he married Sofia Ave Maria Sanchez Bonilla de Amaya y Garcia de Orosco during November 1770 at [[Etzatl<U+00E1>n]].<ref name="Powell 35-6">Powell p. 35-6</ref>  The marriage produced one son, Jesus Miguel Silva de Peralta de la C<U+00F3>rdoba y Sanchez de Bonilla, in 1781.<ref name="Powell 36">Powell p. 36</ref>

In addition to a [[Will (law)|will]],  Don Miguel created several additional documents to ensure his son should inherit his complete estate.  In 1788 Don Miguel placed a [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] in Guadalajara indicating his wishes.<ref name="Powell 36" />  Additionally Don Miguel went to the trouble in August 1787 of creating a {{lang|es|''cedula''}} before a notary in Gudalajara documenting the Peralta grant, title, coat of arms, and the ancestry of his son.<ref name="Powell 36-7">Powell p. 36-7</ref>  Don Miguel fell ill and died at the age of 116.  He was buried in Guadalajara on February 2, 1824.<ref name="Powell 37">Powell p. 37</ref>

==First claim==
After completing his work in Mexico, Reavis returned to San Francisco.  There he showed his documents to influential persons and wrote several anonymous news articles for the ''Examiner'' claimg there was "irrefutable evidence" supporting his claim on the Peralta grant.<ref name="Cockridge 106,113">Cockridge p. 106, 113</ref>  During this time he also was in negotiations with executives from the Southern Pacific Railroad.  The executives were interested in securing a 200 foot wide [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] for their railroad were their tracks crossed the grant while simultaneously blocking the [[Texas Pacific Railroad]] from doing the same.<ref name="Cockridge 77-80">Cockridge p. 77-80</ref><ref name="Powell 77-9">Powell p. 77-9</ref>   As a result of these talks, Charles Crocker signed an agreement providing Reavis with US$5000 upfront money and US$50,000 total to secure an easement across the Peralta grant.<ref name="Cockridge 105">Cockridge p. 105</ref>

Reavis' first official action came in October 1882, when he filed papers with the probate court in [[Safford, Arizona|Safford, Arizona Territory]] showing that he had been assigned Willing's deeds.<ref name="Cockridge 107-8">Cockridge p. 107-8</ref>  The reason for this filing is unclear as the probate court did not have the authority to determine the validity of the claim.  It is possible that the small county seat may have allowed Reavis better solidify his claim with a minimum of other people taking notice at the time.<ref name="Powell 9">Powell p. 9</ref>

The official filing of the claim came on March 27, 1883 in the [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] office of Surveyor General J.W. Robbins.<ref name="Ruffner" /><ref name="Powell 9"/>
Contained in the two trunks full of documents were Willing's deed of purchase along with 
On March 27, 1883, Reavis submitted two trucks full of documents.<ref name="Cockridge 115">Cockridge p. 115</ref>  In addition to Willing's deed of purchase, Reavis filed filed copies of the {{lang|es|''cedulas''}}, wills, codicils, and proclamations he had secured documenting the first baron's life.<ref name="Powell 37-8">Powell p. 37-8</ref>  Following an initial examination of the document, which lasted into the night, Robins promised to register the claim and begin his investigation as the first stage of the certification.<ref name="Cockridge 115-6">Cockridge p. 115-6</ref>

After filing his claim, Reavis established his base of operations at Arizola. This was a location near [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]] containing a small set of ruins that had supposedly been La Hacienda de Peralta.<ref name="Cockridge 117">Cockridge p. 117</ref>  At this site, Reavis brought in craftsman to build a mansion of redwood and red brick, complete with servant quarters, stables, storage sheds, and a protective stone wall surrounding the site.<ref name="Cockridge 120-1">Cockridge p. 120-1</ref>  

While the construction was beginning, Reavis began hiring rent collectors and agents and opened negotiations with James M. Barney, owner of the [[Silver King Mine|Silver King Mining Company]].<ref name="Cockridge 122-3">Cockridge p. 122-3</ref>  After several weeks Barney agreed to pay US$25,000 for a [[Quitclaim deed|quitclaims]].<ref name="Powell 79">Powell p. 79</ref>   While a considerable sum for the day, this price represented only a small sum compared to the profits generated by the mine.<ref name="Cockridge 123">Cockridge p. 123</ref>  Reavis also printed and posted notices throughout the claim instructing residents to contact Reavis' lawyer "for registering tenancy and signing agreements, or regard themselves liable to litigation for trespassing and expulsion when the Peralta Grant is, as it must be, validated by the U.S. Government."<ref name="Cockridge 124">Cockridge p. 124</ref>  He also arraigned for newspapers and hired publicists to announce the land grant, including claims that the title was ironclad and included both water and mineral rights.<ref name="Myers"/>

Soon after, Reavis and his agents began selling quitclaims to gullible and frighten settlers located within the claim boundaries.<ref name="Powell 39">Powell p. 39</ref><ref name="Wagoner 273">Wagoner p. 273</ref>  The prices charged for the quitclaims varied greatly and showed little relation to the value of a property of the current occupants ability to pay.<ref name="Cockridge 127">Cockridge p. 127</ref>  Some residents receiving demands for as much as a US$1,000 while others received a release for free or in exchange for a meal or a couple of drinks.<ref name="Cockridge 127"/><ref name="Powell 39-40">Powell p. 39-40</ref>

Initial reaction to the notices by local residents was stunned disbelief.<ref name="Cockridge 125">Cockridge p. 125</ref>  The claim had the potential effect of nullifying all existing land titles within the grant and most residents were concerned by the potential threat of litigation.<ref name="Myers"/><ref name="Cockridge 125" />  When word spread that both the Southern Pacific Railroad and Silver King Mine had agreed to terms with Reavis, concern turned to panic.  Many residents reasoned that if the mine and railroad, with their associated financial and legal resources, found Reavis' claim too strong to fight then the individual settlers stood no chance against it.<ref name="Powell 40">Powell p. 40</ref><ref name="Myers"/><ref name="Cockridge 123" />  This belief was augmented by Reavis' willingness to allow any interested party access to inspect his documents.<ref name="Powell 39" />  Faced with this challenge, some area pioneers abandoned their homes and land instead of trying to deal with Reavis.<ref name="Myers"/>

===Collapse of the claim===
Most territory residents vehemently opposed Reavis' claim and his efforts to sell quitclaims.<ref name="Powell 40" />  Leading the opposition were two Phoenix newspapers, the ''Herald'' and ''[[Phoenix Gazette|Gazette]]''.<ref name="Powell 41">Powell p. 41</ref>  Beginning in July 1883, the papers called upon area residents to not purchase any quitclaims from Reavis.<ref name="Cockridge 127-8">Cockridge p. 127-8</ref>  The effectiveness of this call was tainted however in November 1883 when it was revealed that ''Herald'' owner Homer H. McNeil had purchased a quitclaim for his property.<ref name="Powell 41"/> In response to the public backlash, the embarrassed McNeil was forced to publicly cancel the purchase.<ref name="Cockridge 132-3">Cockridge p. 132-3</ref>

About the time McNeil was returning his quitclaim, the Surveyor General's office dispatched Spanish language expert Rufus C. Hopkins to Mexico.  Reavis followed Hopkins, bringing a lawyer with him.<ref name="Powell 50">Powell p. 50</ref>  Upon their arrival in Guadalajara, Reavis made his best effort to become indispensable to the 70-year old Hopkins. After introducing the Spanish expert to the local archivists, Reavis the proceeded to guide him through the archives and point out the location of various documents that Reavis.<ref name="Cockridge 129">Cockridge p. 129</ref>  In addition to pointing out various bundles that he wished for Hopkins to inspect, Reavis took time to search new sections of the archive.  It was during this effort that he discovered a copy of the December 1748 {{lang|es|''cedula''}} recommending the initial grant was discovered.<ref name="Powell 50" />

While Reavis and Hopkins were in Mexico, Surveyor General J.W. Robbins died from [[tuberculosis]] and was replaced by his chief clerk, Royal A. Johnson.<ref name="Powell 50" />  Hopkin's report on his findings were favorable and in indicated the claim was well founded.<ref name="Cockridge 129"/> Johnson however was unhappy with the report, noting that while it indicated the seals and signatures all appeared genuine, the parts of the original documents had received on cursory inspection.  Additionally no copy of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III's]] signature had been located for purposes of comparison.  In a supplementary report Hopkins indicated that he had found no mention of Peralta or the grant during a brief search of the records in Mexico City.<ref name="Powell 51">Powell p. 51</ref> 

With the release of Hopkin's initial report, Reavis proclaimed that it was confirmation of his claim was just a matter of time.  He even began rumors that thee U.S. government was planning to offer US$100,000,000 to buy rights to his claim.<ref name="Cockridge 130">Cockridge p. 130</ref>  Johnson in turn only reported the the investigation was ongoing and refused to provide additional details to the public.  As a result, the Surveyor General was labeled as an accomplice to Reavis and vilified by the local newspapers.<ref name="Powell 53">Powell p. 53</ref> 

While this was ongoing, Reavis sought to expand his sale of quitclaims from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where his efforts were initially focused, to the town of [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]].  The initial target of the expansion was Tom Weedin, editor of the Florence ''Enterprise'', whom Reavis approached in January 1884.<ref name="Powell 43">Powell p. 43</ref>  The newspaper editor refused Reavis's offer and instead published an editorial calling for creation of a committee to raise funds to hire a lawyer to fight the Peralta grant in court.<ref name="Cockridge 144-5">Cockridge p. 144-5</ref>  Shortly thereafter, Anti-Reavis committees were established in Florence, [[Globe, Arizona|Globe]], Phoenix, and [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]].<ref name="Cockridge 151-2">Cockridge p. 151-2</ref>

Over the next year-and-a-half, Reavis faced two lawsuits.  The first came from George Willing Sr., father of Reavis' former business partner.  The elder Willing claimed that Mary Ann Willing only possessed a [[life estate]] on her husband's property and could not have legally provided a [[warranty deed]] to Reavis.<ref name="Powell 47">Powell p. 47</ref> An attempt was made to raise funds for this suit by appealing to residents living within the grant and offering land for 20% less than the price set by Congress.<ref name="Powell 47" />  The attempt was unsuccessful.  As a result, Willing ran out of funds and was not hear from again after a short time.<ref name="Powell 48">Powell p. 48</ref>

The second suit was filed by territorial attorney general Clark Churchill to settle [[Title (property)|title]] issues with his personal land holdings.<ref name="Powell 44">Powell p. 44</ref>  To deal with Churchill's suit, Reavis employed a strategy of delay and obfuscation.  During a February 1884 deposition, Reavis was forced to explain how he had come into possession of the Peralta grant and the nature of his relationship with Mary Ann Willings. Questions into his finances however were answered vaguely with Reavis claiming he would need to consult his "agents" to determine most details.<ref name="Powell 44" />  Additional questions regarding the exact boundaries of the grant were answered with similarly vague responses.<ref name="Powell 46">Powell p. 46</ref>  When the suit came to trial in May 1885, Reavis argued the court did not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of a Spanish grant.<ref name="Powell 46" />  The court overruled this and granted Churchill clear title to his property.<ref name="Powell 46-7">Powell p. 46-7</ref>

Following the ruling in the Churchill suit, [[General Land Office|Land Office]] Commissioner W. A. Sparks to Royal Johnson instructing the Surveyor General to halt work on verifying the Peralta grant.<ref name="Powell 54">Powell p. 54</ref>  Johnson willing honored the request.<ref name="Cockridge 155">Cockridge p. 155</ref>  Territorial residents were elated by news of this event as it effectively halted Reavis' efforts.  The ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'' reported "The tempest was all in a teapot after all" while another territorial newspaper ran the headline "Reavis Nailed Up".<ref name="Powell 55">Powell p. 55</ref>  Public meetings were quickly organized throughout the territory calling for a final determination on the grant.<ref name="Powell 55-6">Powell p. 55-6</ref>

Sensing the situation turning against him, Reavis hastily left for California.<ref name="Powell 56">Powell p. 56</ref>  Two weeks later he was largely forgotten however as [[Geronimo]] led 144 [[Chiricahua Apache]] off the reservation and brought the [[Apache Wars]] back to Arizona Territory.<ref name="Powell 57">Powell p. 57</ref>

==Second claim==
Reavis had realized before the collapse of his first claim that the complex series of [[Conveyancing|conveyances]] by which he claimed to have acquired the rights to the Peralta grant represented a serious weakness to his plans.  To overcome this weakness Reavis had began he work to establish an heiress to the grant while he was still preparing his first claim.<ref name="Cockridge 156-7">Cockridge p. 156-7</ref>

[[File:Do<U+00F1>a Sofia Loreto Micaela de Peralta-Reavis2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Do<U+00F1>a Sophia Micaela Maso Reavis y Peralta de la C<U+00F3>rdoba, third Baroness of Arizona]]
Reavis claimed to have heard rumors of a Peralta descendant as early as his arrival in California in 1875.<ref name="Powell 68">Powell p. 68</ref>  It was not until 1877 however that he met the heiress.  While traveling on a train, he spotted a young lady who bore a striking resemblance to the second baroness.{{#tag:ref|Reavis never provided by explanation as to how he had learned about the appearance of the wife of the second Baron of Arizona prior to his 1887 encounter with Sofia.<ref name="Cockridge 166"/>|group="Note"}}  After inquiring about her identity and background, and learning she knew of the name Maso, Reavis told her that she was most likely the heiress to a large fortune.<ref name="Cockridge 166">Cockridge p. 166</ref>  As the young lady had no papers establishing her identity, it was left to Reavis to find them.<ref name="Powell 62">Powell p. 62</ref>  The pair exchanged letters with each other until the end of 1882.  At that time Reavis visited her in [[Knights Landing, California]], were she worked as a house servant, and proposed marriage.  The couple were married in a [[Civil marriage|civil ceremony]] dated December 31, 1882.<ref name="Cockridge 166"/>{{#tag:ref|As Reavis was still married to Ada Pope till their divorce the next year, the second marriage was initially kept secret.<ref name="Cockridge 166"/>|group="Note"}}  Following their marriage, Reavis enrolled his new bride in a [[convent school]] to train her in the skills expected of a well-born lady.<ref name="Cockridge 175">Cockridge p. 175</ref>

After his first claim collapsed, Reavis returned to California to collect [[letters of introduction]] to influential [[New York]]ers from his friends and business contacts.<ref name="Cockridge 182">Cockridge p. 182</ref>  To these he added a number of Spanish contacts from his association with Spanish reporter Carlos Satana and a friendship with the Spanish [[Consul (representative)|consul]] stationed in San Francisco.<ref name="Cockridge 184">Cockridge p. 184</ref>  From California Reavis traveled with his wife, who was presented as his [[Ward (law)|ward]], to New York.  There he met with persons such as [[U.S. Senator]] [[Roscoe Conkling]], former [[U.S. Congressman]] [[Dwight Townsend]], Henry Porter of the [[American Bank Note Company]], and [[Hector de Castro]].<ref name="Cockridge 182-3">Cockridge p. 182-3</ref>  [[John W. Mackay]] was so impressed by Reavis' papers that he agreed to finance a search of the Spanish archives for additional documents.<ref name="Powell 68-9">Powell p. 68-9</ref>  To this end, Mackay provided him with a US$500/month stipend, an amount sufficient for the Reavis party to travel in a manner consistent with an influential family.<ref name="Powell 80">Powell p. 80</ref>

In December 1885, the Reavis party sailed for Europe.<ref name="Powell 69">Powell p. 69</ref>  Upon reaching Spain, Reavis began searching archives in [[Madrid]] and [[Seville]] related to the second Baron and his descendants.  It took several months of searching before Don Jesus Miguel's will leaving his estate to Sophia was located.<ref name="Powell 71">Powell p. 71</ref>   In addition to the various documents he located in the archives, Reavis also acquired several [[portrait painting]]s and [[daguerreotype]] photographs of individuals he claimed to have been his wife's ancestors.<ref name="Cockridge 232">Cockridge p. 232</ref> Spanish members of the Peralta and Ibarras, believing Sophia was a long-lost relative, entertained Reavis' wife while he was performing his search.  After he located the desired papers, Reavis and his wife publicly announced their marriage and recorded their marriage contract with the United States [[legation]]'s [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]].  The announcement was met with a new round of celebrations before the couple left Spain to make a tour of [[Mediterranean]] ports.  The couple did not return to the United States till November 1886.<ref name="Powell 71" />

Upon his return to the United States, Reavis spent some time in New York renewing his acquaintances with various political and business leaders.<ref name="Cockridge 237">Cockridge p. 237</ref>  Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements.   [[James Broadhead]], who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, following his examination proclaimed, "The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Hurd who have pronounced it good.  I have associated with them in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs.  Mr. J. Addison Reavis is the gentleman who is pushing the claim and his is a man of remarkable energy and persistence."<ref name="Powell 84">Powell p. 84</ref>  [[Roscoe Conkling]] in turn stated "I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find they all go to show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee."<ref name="Powell 83">Powell p. 83</ref> In addition to the endorcement, Conkling introduced Reavis to [[Robert G. Ingersoll]].<ref name="Cockridge 239">Cockridge p. 239</ref>  Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.<ref name="Cockridge 243">Cockridge p. 243</ref>  

From New York the Reavis party went to California.  There Reavis obtained an affidavit from Alfred Sherwood certifying he had known Sophia and her parents since her birth, she had been born in [[San Diego County, California]], and that she had been left in the custody of Don Jose R. C. Maso following the death of her mother and twin brother when her father had need to travel to Spain.<ref name="Powell 71" />

[[File:Do<U+00F1>a Peralta-Reavis in front of carved map.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Third baroness of Arizona standing in front of "Inicial Monument"]]
By the time that Reavis returned to Arizona Territory in August 1887 he was using the name "James Addison Peralta-Reavis".  The reason for his journey to Tucson was to file a new claim on behalf of his wife, Do<U+00F1>a Sophia Micaela Maso Reavis y Peralta de la C<U+00F3>rdoba, third Baroness of Arizona.<ref name="Powell 62" />  Before making the formal filing, Reavis hired a carriage and took a trip to the mountains south of Phoenix.  During this trip he and his wife happened across the "Inicial Monument" that marked her great-grandfather's land.<ref name="Powell 72">Powell p. 72</ref>

Formal filing of the second claim came on September 2, 1887.  Included with the official copied and photographs of original wills and codicils was a photograph of the third Baroness standing before the "Inicial Monument".<ref name="Powell 72" />   With the discovery of this marker, the claim was shifted {{convert|8|mi|km}} south.<ref name="Powell 149">Powell p. 149</ref>  To address possible inconsistencies with his original claim, Reavis claimed to suspect that some of the Willings' papers to be forgeries, but upon advice of his lawyers had filed his initial claim to initially establish the grant before U.S. authorities and to buy time while searching for proof of his wife's identity.<ref name="Powell 68-9" />  In addition to the claim, Reavis posted a US$10,000 deposit to assure an official survey of the grant.<ref name="Powell 74">Powell p. 74</ref>  Surveyor General John Hise refused to have the survey performed as it would imply the government had approved the claim.<ref name="Powell 88">Powell p. 88</ref>

===Second baron and his family===

The new filings by Reavis continued the story of the Peralta family.

The second Baron of Arizona, Don Jesus Miguel , never took an interest in his property within Arizona due to the threatening Apache presence.  He married Do<U+00F1>a Juana Laura Ibarra, a member of a prominent Guadalajara family, in 1822.<ref name="Powell 65">Powell p. 65</ref>  Something of a spendthrift, Don Jesus Miguel frittered away most of his inheritance.  After selling most of his properties, the second Baron settled into his [[Sonora]] estate.<ref name="Cockridge 161">Cockridge p. 161</ref>  After ten years of marriage, the couple had their only child, Sophia Laura Micaela de Peralta de la C<U+00F3>rdoba y Ibarra.<ref name="Powell 65" /><ref name="Cockridge 162">Cockridge p. 162</ref>

Do<U+00F1>a Sophia married Jos<U+00E9> Ramon Carmen Maso in 1860.<ref name="Powell 65-6">Powell p. 65-6</ref>  With his remote location providing a limited selection of suitors with appropriate standing, the Baron was initially pleased to have found a husband for his 28-year old daughter.  It was only after the wedding that he discovered his new son-in-law had a reputation as a "gentleman sport" (professional gambler) and ne'er-do-well in California.<ref name="Cockridge 162" />

In 1862, Maso was called to Spain to collect some funds owed to him and the Baron.<ref name="Powell 66">Powell p. 66</ref>  Maso left for San Francisco with the Baron, his mother, Do<U+00F1>a Carmelita Maso, and his then pregnant wife.<ref name="Cockridge 163">Cockridge p. 163</ref>  No explanation as to why the party did not embark from the more convenient port at [[Guaymas]] was ever given.<ref name="Powell 66" />  While in [[Agua Mansa, California]], Do<U+00F1>a Sophia unexpectedly went into labor and gave birth to twins, one boy and one girl.<ref name="Cockridge 163" />  The twins were quickly [[Infant baptism|baptized]] at the nearby Mission San Salvador.  Complications from the birth occurred and the boy and mother both died.  A [[wet nurse]] was located and arraignments were made for the newborn girl to be taken care of by a friend of Maso, John A. Treadway.<ref name="Powell 66" />  Maso then continued his journey while Don Jesus Miguel remained in San Francisco to be near his granddaughter.<ref name="Cockridge 164-5">Cockridge p. 164-5</ref>  Several months later, Don Jesus Miguel was summoned to Spain by Maso.  They both died in Spain, but not before the Baron had time to file a codicil to his San Francisco will naming his granddaughter as his sole heir.<ref name="Powell 67">Powell p. 67</ref>

In California, Treadway made arrangements with Alfred Sherwood to look after the infant Sophia and Do<U+00F1>a Carmelita Maso while he took a business trip.  During this trip, Treadway died near [[Sacramento, California]].<ref name="Powell 67" />  Do<U+00F1>a Carmelita Maso in turn died when Sophia was five.<ref name="Powell 67" />  When she was eight years old, Sophia was taken into the house of John Snowball.  He remembered the young girl speaking of an inheritance that was to come to her.<ref name="Powell 67-8">Powell p. 67-8</ref>

===Development plans for Arizona===
Reaction to the new claim by Arizona residents was nearly unanimously negative, with some newspapers publishing open incitements to violence against Reavis.<ref name="Cockridge 252">Cockridge p. 252</ref>  As a result of the opposition, sale of new quitclaims effectively ended.<ref name="Powell 79" />  
During his trip to Spain and visits to New York, Reavis had gained an understanding of government and big business finance.<ref name="Cockridge 235-6">Cockridge p. 235-6</ref>  He put this new knowledge to work and began offering investment opportunities involving the development of Arizona Territory.  With the accomplished business leaders he had met in New York and convinced of the legitimacy of his claim advocating on his behalf, Reavis began to gain millions of dollars in new funds.<ref name="Cockridge 238-9">Cockridge p. 238-9</ref>{{#tag:ref|Of the estimated [[US$]]5,300,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|5300000|1895|r=2}}}} in current dollar terms) in cash and [[promissory note]]s acquired by Reavis during the course of his fraud, only US$175,000 to US$225,000 was accumulated while he was still pressing the first claim.<ref name="Cockridge 150" />|group="Note"}}

[[File:Casa Grande Improvement Company Limited, Territory of Arizona 50 share certificate.jpg|thumb|left|Stock certificate for the Casa Grande Improvement Company Limited]]
Reavis formed three corporations in rapid succession in 1887, each bearing the name Casa Grande Improvement Company.<ref name="Powell 80-1">Powell p. 80-1</ref>  Each had Reavis as director and well known business leaders selected to serve as president and vice-presidents.<ref name="Cockridge 238">Cockridge p. 238</ref>  The third, the Casa Grande Improvement Company of Arizona, was incorporated in November and absorbed the prior two entities.<ref name="Powell 80-1" />  The purpose of the company was to develop the land of the grant by building roads, railways, dams, irrigation canals, telegraph lines, and other improvements while simultaneously engaging in leasing water rights, selling livestock, and performing other activities.  [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] was company's first president while other initial investors included [[Hector de Castro]], [[Dwight Townsend]] and Henry Porter of the [[American Bank Note Company]]<ref name="Powell 81">Powell p. 81</ref>

Among the development plans Reavis announced was construction of a large scale irrigation system.<ref name="Cockridge 257">Cockridge p. 257</ref>  At the core of the system was a proposed {{convert|450|ft|m}} masonry dam on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] near its junction with [[Tonto Creek]] (near where [[Theodore Roosevelt Dam]] was later built) and a {{convert|250|ft|m}} dam on the [[Gila River]] west of Florence.  Proposed cost of these dams were US$2,500,000 and US$1,000,000 respectfully<ref name="Powell 113">Powell p. 113</ref>{{#tag:ref|The price estimates of US$2,500,000 and US$1,000,000 used by Reavis for construction of dams on the Salt and Gila River appear unrealistically low. The {{convert|280|ft|m}} [[Theodore Roosevelt Dam]], completed in 1911 at the site of Reavis' proposed {{convert|450|ft|m}} masonry dam, cost the U.S. government US$5,500,000 to construct.<ref name="Powell 113" />|group="Note"}}

By the time of the second filing, Reavis was dressing in the finest linen and broadcloth while his wife wore the products of New York and San Francisco's best dressmakers.<ref name="Powell 75">Powell p. 75</ref>  Finding conditions in Arizona too hostile to his ambitions, Reavis rarely spent time at his mansion in Arizola.<ref name="Cockridge 257" />  He and his wife instead maintained residences in San Francisco, St. Louis, and near New York City were they entertained the social and financial elite.<ref name="Myers"/>   During one stay in New York, Mrs. Reavis, possibly feeling lonely while her husband was busy with his business dealings, found a two-month old orphan boy.  She adopted the boy and named him Fenton after her husband's father.<ref name="Powell 81" />  Reavis also purchased a [[hacienda]] in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].  In Mexico, Reavis also became a [[patron]] of various charities, opening a home for the blind and a hospital.  Additionally he built a monument dedicated to Don Miguel de Peralta in [[Monterrey]] and donated new altar linens for a cathedral in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]].<ref name="Cockridge 257"/>

==Fraud revealed==
The [[United States presidential election, 1888|U.S. Presidential election of 1888]] resulted in the return of a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[White House]].  Following the inauguration of Benjamin Harrison, Royal Johnson was reappointed Surveyor General for Arizona Territory in July 1889.<ref name="Powell 90">Powell p. 90</ref>  Despite having been out of office, Johnson had continued to investigate the validity of the Reavis claim.<ref name = "Ruffner 2">{{Cite news | last = Ruffner | first = Budge | title = 'Baron Of Arizona' Had Quite A Scheme (Part 2) | newspaper = The Courier | location =Prescott, Arizona | pages = 10 | date = September 17, 1982 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xaIKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qkwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5518%2C416027 }}</ref>  About this time, the acting Commissioner of the Land Office had received inquiries as to the status of the Peralta grant and in September of that year sent Johnson a letter directing the Surveyor General to "please report to me the exact condition of said grant as shown by papers and records in your office, and all the information you can obtain in regard to it."<ref name="Powell 90"/>  Johnson responded to this request on October 12, 1889 with the release of ''Adverse report of the Surveyor General of Arizona, Royal A. Johnson, upon the alleged Peralta Grant : a complete expose of its fraudulent character''.<ref name="Cockridge 259">Cockridge p. 259</ref>

Among the issues found in the report with the Peralta grant were:
*Most of the claim's 18th century documents showed evidence of having been written with steel [[Nib (pen)|nibbed]] pens, a tool rarely used until the 19th century, instead of a [[quill]].<ref name="Powell 91">Powell p. 91</ref>
*Printing styles on the Peralta documents differed with documents from the same time period, particularly in the use of the [[long s]].<ref name="Powell 92">Powell p. 92</ref>
*Search of Spanish archives for supporting documents failed to find information on the Peralta grant in locations where such information was expected to be located.<ref name="Powell 93-4">Powell p. 93-4</ref>
*Multiple spelling errors and grammar issues were present in the Peralta documents, a situation highly atypical of documents from the Spanish Royal court.<ref name="Powell 98-9">Powell p. 98-9</ref>

Johnson's report was met with celebration by the residents of Arizona and the once demonized Surveyor General became the toast of the town.<ref name="Cockridge 271">Cockridge p. 271</ref>  The ''Gazette'' praised the Surveyor General's intelligence and fairness while extending the thanks of the Salt River valley.  The ''Herald'' in turn printed "No one has criticized Johnson more than we and these criticisms were founded largely on his own statements, but no one will do Mr. Johnson complete justice for his actions on behalf of the settlers sooner or more heartily give him credit for standing by them in their time of need than the Herald."<ref name="Powell 99">Powell p. 99</ref>  [[Oakes Murphy|Governor Murphy]] even invited Johnson to Phoenix where a public reception was held in his honor.<ref name="Cockridge 271"/>

Response in Washington to Johnson's report was more subdued.<ref name="Powell 100">Powell p. 100</ref>  Reavis had enlisted the aid of [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[John Willock Noble]] and U.S. Senator [[Francis Cockrell]] to lobby on his behalf.  As a result it took until February 20, 1890 for the Commissioner of the Land Office, Lewis Groff, to respond to Johnson's report.<ref name="Cockridge 271" />  Groff's letter to Johnson was generally critical of the Surveyor General but could not disregard the report's findings.<ref name="Powell 100-1">Powell p. 100-1</ref>  The letter ended with instructions for Johnson "to strike the case from your docket and notify Mr. Reavis of the action, allowing the usual time for an appeal to the Hon. Secretary of the Interior."<ref name="Cockridge 271"/>

===Reavis' response===
In response to Johnson's report and the subsequent dismissal of his claim, Reavis filed  [[lawsuit|suit]] against the United States in the [[United States Court of Claims|Court of Claims]].  The lawsuit claimed the government has taken land belonging to Reavis and his wife and sold it to settlers, government had reserved 1,500,000 acres for its own use, had appropriated excessive water rights from the Gila River, and had denied the plaintiffs of their Constitutional right to due process.<ref name="Powell 102">Powell p. 102</ref>  Reavis sought US$11,000,000 in [[damages]] already incurred with provisions in the suit for "further relief and costs" against future damages.  [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] attorney Harvey S. Brown served as Reavis' lead council while [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] and [[James Broadhead]] assisted in preparing the case.<ref name="Cockridge 273">Cockridge p. 273</ref>

At the time of filing, Reavis and his wife said they were aware that the Surveyor General had released a report but claimed to not have been able to obtain a copy.<ref name="Powell 102" />  Following the initial filing a [[continuance]] was filed to allow time for additional evidence to be collected.<ref name="Cockridge 275">Cockridge p. 275</ref>  During the course of this delay, in March 1891, [[United States Court of Private Land Claims]] was created with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims involving old French, Mexican, and Spanish land claims.<ref name="Cockridge 273-4">Cockridge p. 273-4</ref>

After filing suit, Reavis went to California to locate witnesses who were familiar with the details of Sophia's youth.<ref name="Cockridge 278">Cockridge p. 278</ref>  During October and November 1890 a series of [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] were held in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]] to take testimony from the witnesses he had located.<ref name="Powell 103">Powell p. 103</ref>  Key witness located during this process were Miguel Noe Sr., his son Miguel Jr., Andr<U+00E9>s Sandoval, Alfred Sherwood, John Snowball.<ref name="Cockridge 281">Cockridge p. 281</ref>  Noe testified having been a friend of Jos<U+00E9> Ramon Carmen Maso and to having met the second Baron during his time in California before his return to Spain.  The testimony included a wide variety of details related to the second Baron's stay and included Noe accompanying the Baron to Sherwood Valley to confirm that his granddaughter was well cared for.<ref name="Cockridge 281-2">Cockridge p. 281-2</ref><ref name="Powell 109">Powell p. 109</ref>   The senior Noe's testimony was supported Miguel Jr. relaying his childhood memories of the second Baron.<ref name="Cockridge 282">Cockridge p. 282</ref>  Andr<U+00E9>s Sandoval testified to having run a boardinghouse and restaurant where the second Baron and his son-in-law had stayed they were in San Francisco.<ref name="Cockridge 283">Cockridge p. 283</ref><ref name="Powell 109-10">Powell p. 109-10</ref>  Sherwood providing details of Sophia's life from when she had been brought home by John Treadway at four months of age in July 1862, how she had been attended by her wet nurse and grandmother, and how her grandmother had told the young girl of a large inheritance she would someday receive.<ref name="Powell 104">Powell p. 104</ref>  Snowball in turn testified as to how he had take the orphaned girl into his house when she was eight and raised her till 1876 when she left to work with a dressmaker.<ref name="Powell 104" />  Other witnesses filled in additional details of Sophia's life between 1879 and 1882.<ref name="Powell 104" />

In addition to details about his wife's early childhood, Reavis discovered other witnesses able to relate details about her family.  In this manner additional details were revealed about the second Baron and his activities during the 1850s.  Another revelation was the existence of a previously unknown [[third cousin]] to the third Baroness, Miguel Lauro Peralta y Vasquez.  Information discovered about this cousin showed that he was traveled through Arizona during the time period in which Willing had purchased the rights to the Peralta grant and could potentially have posed as the second Baron during the transaction.<ref name="Powell 105">Powell p. 105</ref>

A trip to San Bernardino in early 1892 resulted in Reavis discovering baptismal records for the Maso twins along with a record of burial of mother and new born son.<ref name="Powell 107">Powell p. 107</ref>  Following this stop, Reavis returned to Guadalajara to search for additional records.  A local historian informed him that some records had been stored in the archives of the ''Ayuntamiento'' (Common Council).  An extended search of these records resulted in a copy of the first baron's probate proceedings being found.<ref name="Powell 107" />  The apparent reason for why they had never been found in previous searches was that they had been misfiled with a group of 1824 papers, possibly as a consequence of the first Baron's probate proceedings.<ref name="Cockridge 277">Cockridge p. 277</ref> Included in these records was a Peralta family genealogy and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheon]], and {{lang|es|''cedulas''}} showing the first barons promotion to captain of dragoons (1748), declaring the royal intention to make a land grant(1748), and approving the grant (1778).<ref name="Powell 108">Powell p. 108</ref>

[[File:Peralta-Reavis twin boys.jpg|thumb|left|The Reavis twins, Carlos and Miguel circa 1898]]
During the second half of 1892 Reavis had hoped to perform another search for witnesses in the company of James Broadhead.  Broadhead's duties as a Congressman however forced a delay of this plan until at least mid-1893.  This delay worked for Reavis as on March 8, 1893 his wife gave birth to twin boy, named Carlos Jes<U+00FA>s and Miguel in honor of the first and second Barons.<ref name="Cockridge 279">Cockridge p. 279</ref>  Reavis viewed this birth as further proof of Sophia being a twin.<ref name="Powell 108" />

By 1893, Reavis began to develop financial problems.  Travel, research, and legal expenses, combined with the maintenance expenses of his various households, had consumed most of his available cash.  Questions about the status of the Peralta claim in turn had dried up most new investments.<ref name="Cockridge 280">Cockridge p. 280</ref>  To  maintain solvency and defray his expenses, Reavis made arraignments with a group of Washington and San Francisco businessmen to extend him US$30,000 at the rate of US$2500/month.<ref name="Powell 111">Powell p. 111</ref>

With the volume of evidence and witness testimony accumulated, James Broadhead decided that the Peralta case was proven.<ref name="Powell 110">Powell p. 110</ref>
Reavis went to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory]] to file his final complaint in February 1893.  Land Office draftsman William Strover recalled "an express wagon drove up and unloaded an array of boxes and packages, all addressed to the court and marked 'Peralta Grant.'  When all was unpacked three large tables, placed end to end, filled with documents, ancient books,pictures, including a large oil painting of the Marquis de Peralta, in his robes as grandee of Spain.  There were documents with large leaden seals attached and signed by the king of Spain.  There was a complete history of the marquis [and] letters to him and from him."<ref name="Powell 110" />
After submitting his amended filing, Reavis and his family moved back to his mansion in Arizola.<ref name="Cockridge 285">Cockridge p. 285</ref>

===Government investigation===
[[File:Peralta grant document 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Forged Peralta grant document created by adding a page number (upper right) and the word "Lo" (lower right) to an otherwise valid original.]]
In response to Reavis' suit, Mathew Given Reynolds was appointed special attorney for the [[United States Court of Private Land Claims]].<ref name="Powell 117">Powell p. 117</ref> Sevaro Mallet-Prevost, a New York lawyer born in Zacatecas, Mexico and familiar with Spanish and Mexican law, and William M. Tipton, an expert on [[Questioned document examination|handwriting analysis]], were assigned to assist.<ref name="Cockridge 275" />  Mallet-Prevost and Tipton were dispatched to Tucson in January 1894 to make an examination of Reavis' original claim.  From there, Mallet-Prevost continued on to the archives in Mexico.<ref name="Powell 117-8">Powell p. 117-8</ref><ref name="Cockridge 287-8">Cockridge p. 287-8</ref>

As the archives in Guadalajara were in the process of being moved, Mallet-Prevost began his search in Mexico City.  A search of the National Archives found no record of the Peralta grant but did produce copies of signatures and 18th century documents for use in late comparisons.<ref name="Powell 118">Powell p. 118</ref>  From Mexico City he went to Guadalajara, arriving just after the move of the archive was completed. Upon his return to Santa Fe in April 1894, Mallet-Prevost stated he was "entirely convinced of the spurious character of every paper there filed".<ref name="Powell 118-9">Powell p. 118-9</ref><ref name="Cockridge 288">Cockridge p. 288</ref>

After examining the Mexican archives, Mallet-Prevost was sent to Spain, arriving in Madrid on June 12, 1894.<ref name="Powell 119">Powell p. 119</ref>  The first place the Mexican-born lawyer checked was the {{lang|es|''Archives de Indias''}} in Seville.<ref name="Cockridge 288"/>  There he found that Reavis had arrived as a tourist and after several days had applied for and was granted permission to search the archives.<ref name="Powell 119-20">Powell p. 119-20</ref>  Reavis searched bundles for several days without success, the archivist assigned to assist him believing the documents he was searching for did not exist.  Reavis then requested access to case 77, drawer 3, {{lang|es|''legajo''}} (file) 31.  The assisting archivist was surprised to see a document he had previously never seen in the bundle.  This incident was reported to the Chief Archivist who ordered that Reavis be carefully watched and that all records be carefully numbered before Reavis was allowed to examine them in the future.<ref name="Powell 120">Powell p. 120</ref>

When Reavis later returned to the archive, the prescribed measures had been put into place.  At the end of one day Reavis discovered a document in a bundle he was searching a requested a certified copy of it.  The document was in an envelope and the paper folded.  No other documents in the bundle were folded and the document Reavis had found was not numbered as other pages in the bundle had been.<ref name="Powell 120-1">Powell p. 120-1</ref> Based upon this evidence and testimony from other clerks in the archive that the questioned document had not originally been part of the bundle, an arrest warrant was issued for Reavis.<ref name="Powell 121">Powell p. 121</ref>  Reavis however left Seville before an arrest could be made and influential friends in Madrid had suppressed any further investigation.<ref name="Cockridge 291">Cockridge p. 291</ref>

While Mallet-Prevost was at the archives in Spain, Reynolds went to California to perform background investigations on the witnesses Reavis had located.<ref name="Cockridge 292">Cockridge p. 292</ref>  During this process, Reynolds was approached by San Francisco lawyer William W. Allen.<ref name="Cockridge 292" />  Allen informed the investigator that "I have an original contract made by and between Reavis and his wife, and a witness, in which the witness is to receive a contingency fee of fifty thousand dollars if he testifies to a certain statement prepared by Reavis."<ref name="Powell 123">Powell p. 123</ref>  Allen later told  how Reavis had given Miguel Noe information about Don Jos<U+00E9> Maso, Noe's supposed close friend, to Moe to commit to memory.  As part of the agreement, Noe was expected to locate other persons willing to memorize and testify to other events.<ref name="Powell 123" />

On September 6, 1894, the government requested a judge be commissioned to take testimony.  Despite protests from Reavis' attorney, Judge Thomas C. Fuller was appointed.  Testimony was taken in Guadalajara between October 16 and October 26, 1894.<ref name="Powell 122">Powell p. 122</ref>  Despite being informed of the proceedings, no one representing Reavis attended the proceedings.  The most likely explanation for this is that Reavis could no longer pay his attorneys.<ref name="Cockridge 292"/>  The testimony centered on the December 20, 1748 {{lang|es|''cedula''}} recommending the Viceroy make the Peralta grant.<ref name="Cockridge 295">Cockridge p. 295</ref>  When asked about this document, archivist Emitiro Robles Giles testified "I have searched all those archives in which such a {{lang|es|''cedula''}} should be found and I do not find it; I have found, however, a record to that effect; I have found in the protocol of the Notory Diego de la Sierra y Due<U+00F1>as certain documents in relation to the matter which are notoriously not genuine."<ref name="Powell 122-3">Powell p. 122-3</ref>

On January 5, 1895 Judge Wilbur F.Stone left New York to take evidence in Spain.<ref name="Cockridge 303">Cockridge p. 303</ref>  Due to delays in obtaining cooperation from the Spanish government this process was not completed till March 3, 1895.  Following his return, a trial date was set for May 30, 1895.<ref name="Powell 123" />  As details of the government's evidence became known, the lawyers representing Reavis began withdrawing from the case.<ref name="Cockridge 292"/>  Attorney Phil B. Thompson notified the Court of Private Land Claims of his withdrawal in a letter.<ref name="Powell 130">Powell p. 130</ref>  James Broadhead was unable to continue represent Reavis due to his appointment as Minister to Switzerland.<ref name="Powell 133-4">Powell p. 133-4</ref>  In the mean time, Reavis' money had run out and he was destitute by the time the trial began.<ref name="Powell 134">Powell p. 134</ref>

===Civil suit===
The trial for Reavis' civil action began on Monday June 3, 1895 at 10:00.<ref name="Cockridge 307">Cockridge p. 307</ref>  As neither Reavis nor anyone representing him was in attendance, the court adjourned till 14:00 before beginning without his presence.<ref name="Cockridge 308">Cockridge p. 308</ref>  The first motion was from a lawyer representing a group of 106 individuals related to Miguel Peralta of [[Wickenburg, Arizona|Wickenburg, Arizona Territory]].  These real Peralta family members had heard about the case and hoped for a portion of any settlement. In his statement to the court, the lawyer informed the court that:
:"The Government Attorney ... yesterday afternoon placed in my hands the printed evidence .. and to my mind it did seem as though that grant, upon which Reavis relies&mdash;it seems to me, from a cursory examination ... that it is a fabrication, and as such, if such it turns out to be ... I want it distinctly understood by the Court and by the Government Attorney, that we have had nothing to do with it.  We wash our hands from all of it."<ref name="Powell 135">Powell p. 135</ref>

Presentation of the government case began in earnest on Tuesday morning, Reavis and his council still not present.  First on the stand was Mallet-Prevost who testified about language and grammar problems present in some of the Peralta documents.<ref name="Cockridge 312">Cockridge p. 312</ref>   As an example of the problem he identified was one document contained the word {{lang|es|''tanacion''}}, a word not in the [[Spanish language]].  Another example was the word {{lang|es|''descrubudo''}}, an incorrect past tense of the verb {{lang|es|''describir''}}, being used instead of the correct {{lang|es|''descrito''}}.<ref name="Powell 136">Powell p. 136</ref>
[[File:Peralta grant document 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Forged Peralta grant document.  Page is entirely forged and was inserted into a {{lang|es|''cedula''}}.]]

Tipton, the government's document analysis expert, next took the stand to discuss  the 1748 {{lang|es|''cedula''}}.  His examination had found that while the coversheet appeared to be authentic, the only mention to Don Miguel de Peralta was located on a piece of yellowed tissue paper pasted to the paper.  The five sheets of paper contained inside the cover he declared forgeries due to the style of writing used not being consistent with the handwriting in use at the time and the seals being glued to the paper instead of impressed by a metal seal as was the custom at the time of the document.<ref name="Powell 137-8">Powell p. 137-8</ref><ref name="Cockridge 313-5">Cockridge p. 313-5</ref>  

Following this, Tipton went on to problems with other original papers that had been located during the search of the Guadalajara archives.  One group of papers was located in a set of papers related to work done by the [[notary]] Diego de la Sierra between 1697 and 1698.  The Peralta papers had been inserted between two pages of a bound volume numbered 178 and 179 respectfully, printed on paper that was shorter and narrower than the other pages of the book, showed evidence of being folded unlike the book's other pages, and were glued in place instead of being bound as was the rest of the volume.<ref name="Powell 138-9">Powell p. 138-9</ref><ref name="Cockridge 315-6">Cockridge p. 315-6</ref>

Wednesday began with  Mallet-Prevost testifying on his findings during his trip to Spain.  He began with the will of Miguel de Peralta where the only mentions to the name occurred over erasures.<ref name="Powell 139">Powell p. 139</ref>  Additionally the will indicated it had been recorded in the Registry of Mortgages, volume 23, page 2, leaf 216, in section 122.  An examination of that part of the Registry found an unrelated document.<ref name="Powell 139-40">Powell p. 139-40</ref> Tipton and Maller-Provest continued to examine other documents and depositions until later that afternoon.<ref name="Powell 140">Powell p. 140</ref>  At that time a telegraph arrived from Reavis asking for a continuance till June 10, 1895.  The request was granted.<ref name="Cockridge 316-7">Cockridge p. 316-7</ref>

Reavis first appeared in court on June 10, 1895.<ref name="Powell 141">Powell p. 141</ref>  His first act to to ask for a continuance so that he could locate new legal representation.  When this motion met resistance, Reavis made a [[Motion (legal)|motion to dismiss]].<ref name="Cockridge 319">Cockridge p. 319</ref>  Reavis was finally granted a one day continuance so he could prepare to represent himself.<ref name="Powell 141">Powell p. 141</ref>

Tuesday's court session began with Reavis taking the stand.  Beginning with an account of his early career, he described his meeting Dr. Willing and his trip to Prescott to obtain the Peralta documents.<ref name="Powell 142">Powell p. 142</ref>  During the testimony, Reavis listed the names of the many influential legal and business figures with whom he had associated.<ref name="Cockridge 322-3">Cockridge p. 322-3</ref>  When [[Cross-examination|cross-examined]] by Reynolds, Reavis employed a tactic of providing excessive and irrelevant details within his answers.<ref name="Powell 142">Powell p. 142</ref>  Later in the day Reavis was questioned about his discovery of documents within the San Xavier record books, his 1883 trip to the archives in Mexico, and his trip to Spain.<ref name="Powell 142-5">Powell p. 142-5</ref>

Wednesday morning's session began with Reavis being questioned about his marriage contract to his wife, moved to details on his discovery of the"Inicial Monument", and was followed by questioning of his financial transactions with the Southern Pacific Railroad and Silver King mine.<ref name="Powell 147-9">Powell p. 147-9</ref>  When questioned about the boundaries of the grant, Reavis testified that he had found a copy of a map  in the Mexico City archives but the archivist had refused to make him a copy as the map was surrounded by papers the archivist considered to be of a questionable nature.<ref name="Powell 150">Powell p. 150</ref>  To explain the lack of documents from Mexico City, Reavis stated that the archives of the Inquisition had been sealed and no one was allowed access.<ref name="Powell 152">Powell p. 152</ref>
In the afternoon, questioning turned to Revis' discovery of the baptismal and burial records in San Bernardino.<ref name="Powell 154">Powell p. 154</ref> This was followed by questions regarding Alfred Sherwood's 1887 affidavit regarding Sophia's noble birth.<ref name="Powell 156">Powell p. 156</ref>  During this line a questioning an apparent contradiction appeared where Reavis had known of Miguel Noe and others with knowledge of Sophia's early life as early as 1885 yet he did not look for any of these people till 1892.<ref name="Powell 157">Powell p. 157</ref>  On the morning of June 13, Reavis was forced to admit he had doubted some of the documents in his 1883 filing were not genuine, but he had still filed them on advice of council while believing his wife was the true heir.  At the same time he admitted that he had at that time not told his lawyers of his marriage.<ref name="Powell 157-8">Powell p. 157-8</ref>

Thursday afternoon, Father P.J. Stockman, [[rector]] of the church of San Bernardino, testified the records of the baptismal of Mrs. Reavis and her twin brother and deaths of the boy and his mother were forged.<ref name="Powell 159">Powell p. 159</ref> During a trip away from the parish, Stockman had left a young and inexperienced priest, Father Joseph O'Reilly, in charge of the church.  The young priest had been convinced to loan the birth and death registers to Reavis, but had failed to inform Reavis that the church kept a separate index the was organized by last name and updated annually.<ref name="Cockridge 176-7">Cockridge p. 176-7</ref>  During Father Stockman's testimony he pointed out differences in the inks between the pages related to Mrs. Reavis and the rest of ledger.<ref name="Powell 159">Powell p. 159</ref>  The index made no mention of Do<U+00F1>a Sophia Laura or her son and there was no evidence of either of their graves in the parish graveyard.<ref name="Cockridge 328">Cockridge p. 328</ref>  This testimony was followed by Father O'Reilly who identifying Reavis as the person he had given possession of the record books for a period of between two weeks and a month.<ref name="Powell 160">Powell p. 160</ref>  Following the priest's testimony the trial returned to an examination of the documentary evidence.  Reavis was granted a request to be excused from the court during this phase of the trial.<ref name="Powell 160"/>

Testimony on Friday began with Tipton examining the genealogical document for the Peralta family from the first Baron's will.  His testimony showed the first and last leaves of the document to be genuine documents from the indicated period but that the pages in between were all forgeries.<ref name="Powell 161-2">Powell p. 161-2</ref>
This was followed by an examination of the 1742 appointment of Don Miguel Peralta as royal inspector.  It was pointed out the bottom of the document contained the line "{{lang|es|''A la ciudad de Guadalajara avisandola la eleccion que V[uestra] M[agastad] ha hecho de Visitador de la Nueva Espana de la persona del Baron Arizonaca...''}}".  Within this line it was possible for an untrained person to see the words {{lang|es|''Visitador''}} and {{lang|es|''Baron de Arizonaca''}} had been written in a darker ink and by a different hand than the rest of the line.<ref name="Powell 162">Powell p. 162</ref>  Further inspection of the document by Tipton had revealed the document had originally announced the appointment of [[Pedro Cebri<U+00E1>n, 5th Count of Fuenclara]] as Viceroy of New Spain.<ref name="Powell 162"/>  Other evidence showed that the name Peralta had never been appeared on lists of members of the Military Order of Montesa or the Knights of the Golden Fleece.<ref name="Cockridge 331">Cockridge p. 331</ref>  The rest of the day was taken by Royal Johnson who testified to the steps he had taken during his investigation of the Peralta claim and how he came to his conclusions.<ref name="Powell 162-4">Powell p. 162-4</ref>  Rufus C. Hopkins testified on Saturday morning about his part in the Peralta claim investigation.  During the examination he admitted to having a limited knowledge of Spanish and having to make educated guesses as to a documents true meaning during his translations into English.<ref name="Powell 164-5">Powell p. 164-5</ref>

After adjourning for the weekend, the trial resumed on Monday June 17.  Local newspapers had reported that Mrs. Reavis had arrived from [[Denver]] on Friday afternoon and the courtroom was packed with spectators interested in see the third Baroness.<ref name="Cockridge 338-9">Cockridge p. 338-9</ref>  Upon taking the stand, she told of her childhood memories and then confirmed her husband's claim that an archivist in Seville had demanded a bribe before allowing documents related to the Peralta Grant to be copied.  She was however unable to provide few details about the claim papers.<ref name="Powell 166-8">Powell p. 166-8</ref>  Throughout the proceedings, Mrs. Reavis maintained she was the granddaughter of the second Baron despite intense questioning about his existence.<ref name="Cockridge 344">Cockridge p. 344</ref>  Monday's testimony ended with [[Jean-Baptiste Salpointe|Bishop Salpointe]] that he was familiar with the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac|San Xavier]] record book from his historical studies and the documents related to Miguel de Peralta in the record book had not been present before the book before the book had been sent to to [[Philadelphia]] for the [[Centennial Exposition]].<ref name="Powell 169-70">Powell p. 169-70</ref>

The final day of testimony came on June 18.  In an attempt to bolster his case, Reavis attempted to show that a portrait of Don Miguel Nemecio de Peralta de la C<U+00F3>rdoba bore a strong resemblance to his twins.   Other portraits, photographs, and documents were introduced in an attempt to prove the existence of Don Miguel and his family.<ref name="Powell 170-1">Powell p. 170-1</ref>  Closing arguments were presented the next day.  The government waived the right to a closing statement, feeling the presented evidence was strong enough to prove their case.<ref name="Cockridge 351">Cockridge p. 351</ref>  Reavis used the opportunity to introduce a bill of 52 objections.<ref name="Powell 171">Powell p. 171</ref>

The Court of Private Land Claims presented its findings on June 28, 1895.  The decision rejected the claim, finding "that the claim is wholly fictitious and fraudulent" and that the various Peralta documents had been forged and "surreptitiously introduced" into the various archives and record books where they were discovered.<ref name="Powell 172">Powell p. 172</ref><ref name="Cockridge 352-3">Cockridge p. 352-3</ref>

===Criminal trial===
Some Reavis associates did not believe the court's conclusion.  Dr. A. T. Sherwood, who lead an attempt to colonize the grant, told reporters, "It is impossible that any one man could have forged all the signatures in this case.  Reavis would have had to forge over 200 Spanish documents and signatures.  No man could have done it.  It is most the improbable thing conceivable."<ref name="Powell 173">Powell p. 173</ref>  Despite this support, Reavis was arrested and  charged, in a forty-two count indictment, with forgery, presenting false documents to the Court of Private Land Claims, and conspiracy to defraud the United States government.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Indicted on Two Score Counts | newspaper = New York Times | pages = 1 | date = January 20, 1896 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E2D7173BEE33A25753C2A9679C94679ED7CF }}</ref>

[[File:James Addison Reavis in prison clothes.jpg|thumb|upright|Reavis while imprisoned at Santa F<U+00E9>. circa 1895]]
Reavis [[plea]]ded not guilty and requested release on [[bail]].  The court then allowed him to send telegrams to his previous business associates requesting assistance in posting the bond.<ref name="Cockridge 356">Cockridge p. 356</ref>  No one was found willing to post the US$500 bail.<ref name="Powell 174">Powell p. 174</ref>  Reavis spent roughly a year in jail awaiting trial.  During this time his appeal of the civil ruling was denied and his wife moved to Denver.<ref name="Powell 174"/>  During this time, Reynolds went to California to investigate the witnesses that had testified for Reavis.  While there he discovered the date on John Treadway's tombstone showed November 21, 1861, six months before Mrs. Reavis' birth.<ref name="Powell 174"/>

The criminal trial began on June 27, 1896.<ref name="Cockridge 357">Cockridge p. 357</ref>  The trail was mostly a recapitulation of the evidence presented during the civil trial.  Confronted with the government's evidence, Jos<U+00E9> Ramon Valencia and Andr<U+00E9>s Sandoval confessed to perjury and testified against Reavis.  During his testimony, Valencia stated that he had been given a set facts by Miguel Noe and was to testify to these facts in exchange for US$20,000 once the claim was confirmed.  Noe had left for Mexico following the Court of Land Claims ruling and was not expected to return.<ref name="Powell 174"/>  Reavis found guilty on June 30, 1896.<ref name="Powell 175">Powell p. 175</ref>  On July 17, 1896, he was sentenced to two years and a fine of US$5,000.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Telegraphic Brevities | newspaper = New York Times | pages = 1 | date = July 20, 1896 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E7DC123BEE33A25753C2A9619C94679ED7CF }}</ref><ref name="Cockridge 358">Cockridge p. 358</ref>{{#tag:ref|The maximum possible sentence for his criminal conviction was 2 years and a US$10,000 fine.<ref name="Powell 175">Powell p. 175</ref>|group="Note"}}

Reavis was imprisoned from July 18, 1896 to April 18, 1898, earning a three month sentence reduction for good behavior.<ref name="Anderson 220">Anderson p. 220</ref>  By the time of the release, Sophia was living in [[Denver, Colorado]] with the couple's children and working as a [[milliner]].<ref name = "Ruffner 2"/>  Following his release, Reavis visited San Francisco, New York City, and Washington D.C. in an effort to find new investors to finance his development plans for Arizona<ref name="Cockridge 360">Cockridge p. 360</ref>   Instead of the reaction he had previously received, people listened politely but no longer took him seriously.<ref name="Powell 175">Powell p. 175</ref>  Unsuccessful in finding any investors, Reavis moved to Denver for a time to live with his wife and two sons.<ref name="Cockridge 360"/>  He also wandered from place to place advocating his vision for a large scale irrigation system within Arizona.  The "group of capitalists" he hoped for never materialized.<ref name="Powell 176">Powell p. 176</ref>

In 1900, Reavis began the magazine ''Peralta Reavis Real Life Illustrated'' where he promised to provide the complete inside story of the Peralta fraud.  The magazine folded after a single issue.<ref name="Powell 176" />  The same year he wrote a memoir that was published in several installments by the ''San Francisco Call'' under the title "The Confessions of the Baron of Arizona".<ref name="Cockridge 361">Cockridge p. 361</ref>

In June 1902, Reavis's wife filed for divorce on grounds of nonsupport.  Following the divorce little was hear from Reavis.  By 1913 he was living in a poor house in Los Angeles.<ref name="Powell 177">Powell p. 177</ref>  Reavis died in [[Denver, Colorado]] on November 20, 1914 and was buried in a paupers grave.<ref name="Cockridge 365">Cockridge p. 365</ref><ref name = "Ruffner 2"/>  Sophia died on April 5, 1934.  Her obituary in the ''Rocky Mountain News'' made no mention of the Peralata Grant.<ref name="Powell 177" />

After falling out of the public eye, Reavis became the subject of multiple magazine articles.  He was even featured in an official tour book.  Among the tales manufactured about the Baron of Arizona by these sources was that Reavis had used paper bearing the [[watermark]] of a [[Wisconsin]] [[paper mill]] that did not exist until the 1870 or 1880s.  Such tales discount the skill used by Reavis in the manufacture of his forgeries and the level of inspection they received before faults were eventually discovered.<ref name="Cockridge 264">Cockridge p. 264</ref>
Beyond the magazines, Reavis' exploits have also been utilized in several motion pictures.  A fraudulent land claim similar to the one created by Reavis was used as a plot device in the 1939 film ''[[The Night Riders (1939 film)|The Night Riders]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Night Riders (1939) | work = Movies | publisher = New York Times | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/65116/The-Night-Riders/overview | accessdate = 24-01-2011}}</ref>  Reavis' life later served as the basis for ''[[The Baron of Arizona]]'' in 1950.<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Baron of Arizona (1950) | work = Movies | publisher = New York Times | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/3995/The-Baron-of-Arizona/overview | accessdate = 24-01-2011}}</ref>

The mansion Reavis build in Arizola was rediscovered by the [[National Park Service]] in 1953 following years of use as a barn by a local farmer.<ref name="Cockridge 121">Cockridge p. 121</ref>  An evaluation in April 1963 by the Park Service determined restoration of the building was financially infeasible.<ref name="Cockridge 122">Cockridge p. 122</ref>
