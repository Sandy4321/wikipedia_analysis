The '''Fujiwhara effect''', named after [[Sakuhei Fujiwhara]], sometimes referred to as '''Fujiwara interaction''' or '''binary interaction''', is when two nearby [[cyclone|cyclonic]] [[vortex|vortices]] orbit each other and close the distance betwen the circulations of their corresponding [[low-pressure area]]s.  It is named after [[Sakuhei Fujiwhara]], who was the Japanese meteorologist who initially described the effect.  Binary interaction of smaller circulations can cause the formation of a larger cyclone, or cause two cyclones to merge into one.  [[Extratropical cyclone]]s engage in binary interaction when within {{convert|2000|km|mi}} of one another, while [[tropical cyclone]]s interact within {{convert|1400|km|mi}} of each other.

==Description==
When cyclones are in proximity of one other, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems due to their cyclonic wind circulations.  The two vortices will be attracted to each other, and eventually spiral into the center point and merge.  It has not been agreed upon whether this is due to the divergent portion of the [[wind]] or [[vorticity]] advection.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=112|page=1643|title=Comments on "A Numerical Study of the Interactions between Two Cyclones|author=DeMaria, Mark and Johnny C.

The effect is named after Sakuhei Fujiwhara, the Japanese meteorologist who initially described it in a 1921 paper about the motion of vortices in water.<ref name="Fujiwhara1291">{{cite journal |last=Fujiwhara |first=Sakuhei |year=1921 |title=The natural tendency towards symmetry of motion and its application as a principle in meteorology |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=47 |issue=200 |pages=287&ndash;293 |doi=10.1002/qj.49704720010 |bibcode = 1921QJRMS..47..287F }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wfujiwha.htm |title=Fujiwhara effect describes a stormy waltz |accessdate=2008-02-21 |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |date= November 1, 2007}}</ref>

==Tropical cyclones==
{{See also|Tropical cyclone}}
Tropical cyclones can [[tropical cyclogenesis|form]] when smaller circulations within the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] merge.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=June 2010|page=1745|title=Genesis of Tropical Storm Eugene (2005) from Merging Vortices Associated with ITCZ Breakdowns.

The effect becomes noticeable when they approach within {{convert|1400|km|mi}} of each other.  Rotation rates within binary pairs accelerate when tropical cyclones close within {{convert|650|km|mi}} of each other.<ref name="Ziv1995"/>

===Examples===

====North Atlantic====
[[Hurricane Iris (1995)|Hurricane Iris]] of the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season]] interacted with [[Hurricane Humberto (1995)|Hurricane Humberto]], before interacting and absorbing [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Karen|Tropical Storm Karen]] during September 3.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995iris.html TPC NHC IRIS 1995 PRELIMINARY REPORT]</ref>

In [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], the remnant low of [[List of storms in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Lee|Tropical Depression Thirteen]] moved northward and then northeastward around a non-tropical low located to the north of the system. It briefly strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee. Thereafter, Lee weakened back to a tropical depression as it moved northeastward and northwestward around the eastern side of the non-tropical low and eventually absorbed the non-tropical low.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL132005_Lee.pdf NHC Tropical Cyclone Report]</ref>

In the same year, [[Tropical Storm Alpha|Alpha]] was absorbed by [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]].

====Northeast Pacific====

In [[1974 Pacific hurricane season|1974]], Hurricanes [[1974 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Francesca|Francesca]] and [[1974 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Gretchen|Gretchen]] interacted with each other, until they merged on July 19.<ref name="MWR2">{{cite journal|author=Towry, Sharon|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|journal=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|volume=103|issue=6|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1975)103<0550:ENPTCP>2.0.CO;2|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493(1975)103%3C0550%3AENPTCP%3E2.0.CO%3B2|format=[[PDF]]|title=Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclones, 1974.

====Northwest Pacific====
In September [[1994 Pacific typhoon season|1994]], [[1994 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Pat|Typhoon Pat]] and [[1994 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Ruth|Tropical Storm Ruth]] completed a full orbit around their centroid before collapsing into a single cyclone.<ref>[http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1994atcr/pdf/wnp/29w.pdf Joint Typhoon Warning Center - Typhoon Pat] ([[PDF]])</ref>  In August [[1997 Pacific typhoon season|1997]], [[1997 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Amber (Miling)|Typhoon Amber]] absorbed [[1997 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Cass|Tropical Storm Cass]] over [[East China|Eastern China]], after both storms made landfall, on August 30. In October of the same season, [[Typhoon Ivan]] and [[Typhoon Joan (1997)|Typhoon Joan]] were a pair of super typhoons whose interaction affected their motion as Ivan was steered to the west, and Joan was steered more northerly.  In October [[2009 Pacific typhoon season|2009]], [[Typhoon Parma]] interacted with [[Typhoon Melor (2009)|Typhoon Melor]], affecting the movement of Parma.  Parma was moving through the [[South China Sea]] but made a recurvature move to southeastward, so it made its second and third landfall over northern Luzon. In addition, due to the interaction with Melor, Parma weakened into a tropical storm by October 4. 

In November 2009, [[Typhoon Nida (2009)|Typhoon Nida]] absorbed [[2009 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Depression Urduja|Tropical Depression 27W (Urduja)]] and become a powerful typhoon.  In August [[2010 Pacific typhoon season|2010]], a Fujiwara interaction occurred between [[2010 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Namtheun|Tropical Storm Namtheun]] and [[2010 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Lionrock|Severe Tropical Storm Lionrock]]. Namtheun turned southwestward while Lionrock turned eastward. Later, Namtheun weakened into a tropical depression in the [[Taiwan Strait]] and was absorbed by Lionrock.  In August [[2012 Pacific typhoon season|2012]], a Fujiwhara interaction occurred between Typhoon Tembin and Bolaven. Tembin was moving west, when Bolaven caused Tembin to turn east, resulting in a counter-clockwise loop of Tembin which caused torrential rain in Southern Taiwan.

====Southwest Indian Ocean====
In [[2007-08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|2008]], [[2007-08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Fame|Tropical Cyclone Fame]] began orbiting [[2007-08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Gula|Tropical Cyclone Gula]] with the stronger storm, Gula, absorbing Fame.

====South Pacific Ocean====
During January [[1997<U+2013>98 South Pacific cyclone season|1998]], Cyclones [[Cyclone Susan|Susan]] and [[1997<U+2013>98 South Pacific cyclone season#Cyclone Ron|Ron]] interacted with each other, before Susan absorbed Ron during January 9.<ref name="Jan 98">{{cite web|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary January 1998|publisher=Australian Severe Weather|accessdate=2011-06-27|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1998/summ9801.htm|author=Padgett, Gary|year=1998}}</ref>

==Cyclones within the Westerlies==

Binary interaction is seen between nearby extratropical cyclones when within {{convert|2000|km|mi}} of each other.  Interactions between their circulations at the 500 hPa&nbsp;level (18,000&nbsp;feet above [[sea level]]) behave more predictably than their surface circulations.<ref name="Ziv1995">{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|date=1995-05-01|title=Rotation of Binary Cyclones - A Data Analysis Study|author=Ziv, B and P.
