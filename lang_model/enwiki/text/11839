'''Herbert Tremenheere "Herbie" Hewett''' (25 May 1864 <U+2013> 4 March 1921) was an English [[cricketer]] who played and [[Captain (cricket)|captained]] [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in the late 19th century. He also appeared for [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].

Hewett was a belligerent left-handed opening batsman who hit the ball with power, but was also inclined to be argumentative off the pitch. He was educated at [[Harrow School]], and later won a [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1886. As captain of Somerset, he was instrumental in gaining [[First-class cricket|first-class status]] and admission to the [[County Championship]] for the county in 1891. He remained as Somerset captain for three seasons, usually opening the batting with [[Lionel Palairet]]. In 1892, [[Partnership (cricket)|they put on]] 346 for the first wicket, Hewett making 201. The stand remains the county's highest first-wicket partnership. In that season, Hewett made 1,405 runs at an [[Batting average#Cricket|average]] of more than 35, and was named as one of the "[[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Five Batsmen of the Year]]" by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]''. A disagreement over whether play should take place on a sodden pitch in the match against the [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] in 1893 led to Hewett leaving the county at the end of the season.

He continued to play first-class cricket for three more years, during which time he scored centuries against both Oxford and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge Universities]], appearing for a variety of amateur and representative sides. Another disagreement that centred on a wet pitch when captaining an "England XI" at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] prompted Hewett to feel insulted, and he left the match at lunch-time on the first day. His final first-class appearance was for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University in 1896.

==Early life==
Herbert Tremenheere Hewett was born in [[Norton Fitzwarren]], near [[Taunton]] on 25 May 1864. He was educated at [[Harrow School]], and was part of the school's cricket first eleven in 1882 and 1883.<ref name="boty">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154806.html |title=Batsman of the Year - 1893: Herbert Hewett |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> He appeared in the [[Eton v Harrow|annual contest]] against [[Eton College]] in both years, but did little on either occasion, his highest score being six, made in the first-innings in 1882.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/211/211370.html |title=Eton College v Harrow School |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |date=1882-07-14 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/211/211371.html |title=Eton College v Harrow School |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1883-07-13 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> On completion of his studies at Harrow, he attended [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], [[Oxford University]].<ref name="oucc">{{cite book |last1=Bolton |first1=Geoffrey |title=History of the O.U.C.C. |year=1962 |publisher=Holywell Press Ltd. |location=Oxford |page=361 |chapter=Complete List of Oxford Blues to 1960}}</ref> In his reminiscences, [[W.

==First-class debut==
Hewett's debut appearance in first-class cricket came when he was aged 20, playing for [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] in 1884. Facing [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] in late August, he scored 14 and 0 batting as part of the [[Batting order (cricket)|middle order]], and also claimed two [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]], his only ones in first-class cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2897.html |title=Kent v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1884-08-25 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Because of his studies at Oxford, Hewett's initial appearances for the county were limited to July and early August.<ref name="fcm">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-Class Matches played by Herbie Hewett (106) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name="om">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/Other_matches.html |title=Other matches played by Herbie Hewett (61) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> His first match for Somerset in 1885 was made against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in mid-July, during which he scored he maiden [[Century#Half-century|half-century]] in first-class cricket, remaining 50 [[not out]] in the second-innings of a five-wicket victory for Somerset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2987.html |title=Somerset v Hampshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1885-07-16 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> He passed 50 for Somerset on two more occasions during 1885, and finished the season with 247 runs at a [[Batting average#Cricket|batting average]] of 35.28; one of seven seasons in which his average was in excess of 30.<ref name="bbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/f_Batting_by_Season.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Herbie Hewett |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref>

Having previously played as part of the middle-order, Hewett switched to opening the innings at the start of the season, and also took on the [[Captain (cricket)|captaincy]]. The season brought him three half-centuries: two against Warwickshire, and one against Staffordshire, as well as a number of [[not out]] scores.{{#tag:ref|For individual match scorecards see <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128462.html |title=Warwickshire v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1889-06-24 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128471.html |title=Somerset v Staffordshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1889-07-15 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128473.html |title=Essex v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1889-08-09 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/129/129431.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1889-08-12 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128467.html |title=Somerset v Warwickshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1889-08-15 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128474.html |title=Somerset v Hampshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1889-08-19 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref>|group= n}}

==Captaining Somerset==
===Regaining first-class status===
[[File:Somerset1892 RedLillywhite1893.jpg|thumb|Hewett (centre) with the Somerset team of 1892.]]
In his history of Somerset cricket, ''Sunshine, Sixes and Cider'', David Foot describes Hewett's selection policy as captain as being one that was more dependent on the cricketing ability of the player than "of <nowiki>[the player's]</nowiki> social charm and ability to drink into the early hours" <U+2013> unlike some of his predecessors.<ref>Foot (1986), p34.</ref> In 1890, he captained his side unbeaten against county opposition to the "Second-class County Championship".<ref>Foot (1986), p27.</ref> Hewett's cricketing summer began slightly earlier than his county's though, with early season first-class appearances for [[A. J. Webbe]]'s XI and the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen of England]]. In the first of these matches, Hewett scored his maiden first-class century, reaching 114 for A. J. Webbe's XI against Cambridge University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3543.html |title=Cambridge University v AJ Webbe's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1890-05-19 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> Hewett top-scored with 65 in the second-innings of Somerset's opening county match of 1890,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128196.html |title=Middlesex v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1890-05-26 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> and two matches later scored 64 during a first-wicket partnership of 115 with [[Lionel Palairet]] against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128211.html |title=Somerset v Leicestershire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1890-07-14 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> A string of lower scores followed for just under a month before Somerset hosted Staffordshire at [[County Ground, Taunton|Taunton]]. Having dismissed the visitors for 43, Hewett remained 203 [[not out]] when he [[Declaration and forfeiture|declared]] the Somerset innings closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/128/128438.html |title=Somerset v Staffordshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1890-08-11 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> He did not pass 100 again that season, but came close during the [[Scarborough Festival]], being [[bowled]] for 99 in the second-innings for the Gentlemen of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3637.html |title=Gentlemen of England v I Zingari |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1890-08-28 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> In 13 matches that Somerset played against other county opposition in 1890, they won 12 and [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tied]] one. Hewett led the county's batting averages, and the county were unanimously admitted to the [[County Championship]] for 1891, regaining their first-class status.<ref>Foot (1986), pp27<U+2013>28.</ref>

===County Championship cricket===
Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3669.html |title=Middlesex v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1891-05-18 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. [[Lionel Palairet]], [[Bill Roe]] and [[Sammy Woods]] were all missing for various reasons, leaving Hewett with a depleted side and only two real bowlers; [[Ted Tyler]] and [[George Nichols (cricketer)|George Nichols]]. Surrey reached 449, and then bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in each innings.<ref>Foot (1986), pp28<U+2013>29.</ref> Hewett's emotions were still raw from this loss when Surrey travelled to Taunton more than two months later, expecting an easy win to secure a consecutive championship. The Somerset captain top-scored for his team with 55 in the first-innings as they reached 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler then secured a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who added another 331 runs in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. The same trio of Somerset bowlers proceeded to bowl the champions out for a second time, the final wicket falling two minutes from the close of play, granting their team a 130 run victory.<ref>Foot (1986), pp29<U+2013>32.</ref> Hewett had a quiet season with the bat, in addition to his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on only one other occasion; against Middlesex two weeks later.<ref name="bbs"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3752.html |title=Somerset v Middlesex |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1891-08-24 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> He scored 514 runs at an average of 19.76; his lowest average when playing eight or more innings.<ref name="bbs"/>

==Touring North America==
Following the close of the [[1891 County Championship]], Hewett was part of [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]]'s party which toured North America, playing six matches in the [[United States of America]] and two in [[Canada]]. [[Sammy Woods]] wrote that Hewett, along with [[Charles Wreford-Brown]] and [[George Ricketts]] got very [[Seasickness|seasick]] on the journey there.<ref name="Woods45">Woods (1925), p45.</ref> The first two matches were first-class fixtures against the [[Philadelphian cricket team|Gentlemen of Philadelphia]]. Hewett scored 30 and 49 in the first, an eight wicket loss which Woods blamed on being too soon after arriving, claiming the team "had hardly found our land-legs."<ref name="Woods45"/> The first match had yielded an aggregate of 861 runs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3766.html |title=Gentlemen of Philadelphia v Lord Hawke's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1891-09-25 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> the second contained only 352, of which Hewett scored 10 and 29. Only his captain, Lord Hawke, also reached double figures in both innings as the touring side won by four wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3767.html |title=Gentlemen of Philadelphia v Lord Hawke's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1891-10-01 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> None of the remaining fixtures on the tour had first-class status, and not all were eleven-a-side contests. Hewett scored 113 against the sixteen man 'All New York' on [[Staten Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/134/134894.html |title=All New York v Lord Hawke's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1891-10-05 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> a match in which he was standing in as captain due to Lord Hawke being ill.<ref>Woods (1925), p46.</ref> Woods rated Hewett, along with Lord Hawke and Brown as the best batsmen on the tour.<ref>Woods (1925), p47.</ref>

==Batsman of the Year==

==Departure from Somerset==
Hewett began the 1893 season brightly, reaching his half-century in each of his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3945.html |title=Oxford University v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-05-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly thereafter, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, [[George Wood (Somerset cricketer)|George Wood]] replacing him as a [[Substitute (cricket)|substitute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3980.html |title=Kent v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> The visit of the touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] began the process which led to Hewett's resignation from the county. The Australians had last played at Taunton in 1882, when both the ground and the team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and with the talents of [[Sammy Woods]], the match was eagerly awaited. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself.<ref name="roebuck6667">Roebuck (1991), pp66<U+2013>67.</ref> The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the [[Quantock Hills]].<ref name="foot4245">Foot (1986), pp42<U+2013>45.</ref> Hewett, along with Woods and [[Vernon Hill (cricketer)|Vernon Hill]] arranged to play golf in [[Minehead]].<ref name="woods5152">Woods (1925), pp51<U+2013>52.</ref> The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground, a decision which in his reminiscences, Woods supported, claiming that "the decision not to play was premature."<ref name="woods5152"/> At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued with the Somerset committee, eventually losing. The Australian side was recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once."<ref name="roebuck6667"/> David Foot offered s a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's "mind wasn't on the game."<ref name="foot4245"/> No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4004.html |title=Somerset v Australians |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-07-20 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him."<ref name="foot4245"/> Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season.<ref name="roebuck6667"/> Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy abilities.<ref name="roebuck6667"/><ref name="foot4245"/>

In his five further games for Somerset before the end of the season, Hewett hit two centuries, reaching 120 against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4038.html |title=Somerset v Nottinghamshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-08-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and 112 on his final appearance for the county, against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4045.html |title=Somerset v Gloucestershire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-08-28 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He scored 1,092 runs in total during 1893, of which his 669 for Somerset in the championship were scored at an average of 31.85, topping the county's batting charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1893/Somerset_Batting.html |title=Batting and Fielding for Somerset: County Championship 1893 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> During his five seasons of first-class cricket for Somerset, he played 51 matches and scored 2,592 runs at an average of 30.85.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/f_Batting_by_Team.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding For Each Team by Herbie Hewett |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

==Later cricket career and life==
After leaving Somerset, Hewett did not continue in county cricket at all, opting to play first-class cricket only for amateur and representative sides.<ref name="fcm"/> At the tail-end of the 1893 season, he played three times for the South, scoring two half-centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4050.html |title=Yorkshire v South |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-08-31 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4052.html |title=South v Australians |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-09-07 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He appeared 11 times in 1894, scoring 579 runs at an average of 34.05, higher than the previous season. Woods described Hewett as being "in splendid form" when he played, and lamented that he was no longer playing for Somerset.<ref>Wood (1925), p58.</ref> He scored his only century of the season for A. J. Webbe's XI, reaching 110 after opening the innings against Oxford University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4112.html |title=Oxford University v AJ Webbe's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1894-05-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He continued his form with the bat into 1895, twice scoring centuries for the Gentlemen against the universities, making 109 against Cambridge,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4301.html |title=Cambridge University v Gentlemen of England |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1895-05-20 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and 102 against Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4311.html |title=Oxford University v Gentlemen of England |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1895-05-23 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> During this season Hewett appeared in his first match for the amateur side [[I Zingari]], who had strong links with both [[Harrow School]] and Somerset president Sir [[Spencer Ponsonby-Fane]].<ref name="fcm"/>

Hewett played all three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; he opened the innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an 'England XI', a compliment for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant that the start was delayed. Unlike a couple of years earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted "Keep quiet or I'll think about calling the game off".<ref name=f45>Foot (1986), p45.</ref> Hewett did not bother with such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground.<ref name=f45/> [[Fred Spofforth]] replaced him in the match which the England side went on to win by nine wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4460.html |title=Yorkshire v England XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1895-09-05 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

During the English winter of 1895<U+2013>96, Hewett once again toured with Lord Hawke, travelling to [[South Africa]]. He played four matches during the tour, none of which were granted first-class status.<ref name="om"/> Though the tour included three matches against a [[South Africa national cricket team|South African national team]] which were deemed to be [[Test cricket|Tests]], Hewett did not participate in any of them,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/RSA/1895-96_RSA_Lord_Hawkes_XI_in_South_Africa_1895-96.html |title=Lord Hawke's XI in South Africa 1895/96 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and thus completed his cricket career without any Test appearances.<ref name="caprofile">{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/3615.html |title=Player Profile: Herbie Hewett |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He played his final first-class match in 1896, scoring 86 for the MCC against Oxford University.<ref name="fcm"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4580.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Oxford University |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1896-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He continued to play cricket for the Harrow Wanderers, MCC and I Zingari until 1901.<ref name="om"/> 

Hewett trained as a [[barrister]] at the [[Inner Temple]], where he passed at least one exam in 1890.  During the First World War, he served in the [[Territorial Force|Territorial Force Reserve]] as an Assistant [[Provost Marshal]] for the [[London District]], an appointment which he held from 7 September 1915 until 24 May 1918.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29321|supp=yes|startpage=9994|date=8 October 1915}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30773|supp=yes|startpage=7707|date=28 June 1918}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/232837.html |title=Obituaries in 1921 |publisher=Cricinfo |year=1922 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Darling |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Darling, 1st Baron Darling |title=Inner Templars who volunteered and served in the great war (1916) |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/innertemplarswho00inne#page/46/mode/2up |accessdate=2010-10-27 |page=46}}</ref>  He died in [[Hove]], [[Sussex]] on 4 March 1921.<ref name="caprofile"/>

==Personality and style==
When Hewett was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Five Batsmen of the Year]] by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' in 1893, the publication described him as "the finest left-handed batsman in England".<ref name="boty"/> He played in an unorthodox but attractive fashion, with [[W.G. Grace]] praising "his dashing and fearless hitting", while remarking that he had an awkward style.<ref name="wg"/> In ''Somerset, Cider and Sixes'', David Foot described that he was "possessed of an eagle eye, considerable meat and the ability to make his forcing shots attractive."<ref>Foot (1986), p39.</ref> In [[Peter Roebuck]]'s ''From Sammy to Jimmy'', he offered a similar portrait of Hewett's batting style, adding that "he saw it as his task to conquer".<ref name=r49>Roebuck (1991), p49.</ref> Hewett's batting received praise in [[Harry Altham|H.S. Altham]] and [[E. W. Swanton]]'s ''A History of Cricket'', where he is described as a "singularly determined and venomous" batsman who "hit the ball in unexpected and demoralizing directions."<ref name="altham"/> [[Sammy Woods]] claimed that Hewett disliked fielding, but offered the view that he was good at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|point]]. Woods also related how Hewett would chew on a toothpick, which he always had in his mouth when fielding, when his team was losing.<ref>Woods (1925), p52.</ref>

As evidenced by the manner in which Hewett left Somerset and walked off during the [[Scarborough Festival]] of 1895, he possessed a short fuse. Team-mate [[Frederic John Poynton]] characterised his captain as a player who suffered "from a deep, difficult nature, which once upset, took long to recover".<ref name=r49/> He was a strong leader who was both respected and feared by his colleagues.<ref name=r49/>
