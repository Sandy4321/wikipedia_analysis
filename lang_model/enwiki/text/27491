==Plot==
[[Andy Dwyer|Andy]] ([[Chris Pratt]]) takes over as the [[shoeshiner]] at the Pawnee town hall, replacing "Old Gus" ([[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]]), who insults everybody during a farewell party. Later, [[Mark Brendanawicz|Mark]] ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]) breaks the bad news to [[Leslie Knope|Leslie]] ([[Amy Poehler]]) that the Pawnee library has placed a planning claim for Lot 48, which Leslie has been working to turn into a park. Leslie and the rest of the parks department express hatred for the library, which Leslie declares a "diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats", much to the confusion of [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] ([[Rashida Jones]]). [[Ron Swanson|Ron]] ([[Nick Offerman]]) is particularly angry to learn his ex-wife [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Tammy Swanson|Tammy]] ([[Megan Mullally]]), who he insists is evil incarnate, is the new library director.

Leslie decides to confront Tammy directly, only to find Tammy seems to be a friendly woman who instantly agrees to let Leslie have Lot 48 as a "professional courtesy". Impressed, Leslie brings Tammy to the parks department so she can talk to Ron and work out their differences. Tammy and an agitated Ron go off to have coffee, and [[List of Parks and Recreation characters#Donna Meagle|Donna]] ([[Retta (comedian)|Retta]]) insists to Leslie that the arrangement is a mistake because the two act crazy when they are together. At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument in front of the other patrons. Moments later, however, the two are publicly making out on the table in front of everyone. The two rush off to a motel, where they are removing their clothing before even entering the building.

Ann and her boyfriend Mark run into Andy, Ann's ex-boyfriend. Andy flirts with Ann in front of Mark, and openly admits he plans to win her back from him. Mark asks advice from [[Tom Haverford|Tom]] ([[Aziz Ansari]]), who suggests Mark should take the high road. Mark tries to have a have a gentlemanly discussion with Andy, who continues to insist he loves Ann, pointing to the many photos he has of her around his shoeshine station. Finally, Ann confronts Andy and tells him to stop discussing her with Mark, as well as to remove her photos from the wall.

A cheery and singing Ron openly discusses the details  his sexual exploits with Tammy to an uncomfortable Leslie. Although she is initially pleased with the results of her meddling, Leslie soon realizes Tammy is using sex to manipulate Ron to give her control of Lot 48. Leslie confronts Tammy, who admits to the plot and brags that this is how the library operates. Leslie tries to get Ron to break up with Tammy, but he insists he cannot confront her without Leslie's help. The two go to the library, where Ron starts to cave in when Tammy flirts with him. Leslie tells Ron to do whatever will make him happy, even if it means giving up the lot. Ron, impressed that a woman would put his own needs first, decides instead to break up with Tammy and give the lot back to Leslie. After breaking the news to Tammy, he flees from the library with a push-pin stuck in his forehead, and part of his mustache missing.
