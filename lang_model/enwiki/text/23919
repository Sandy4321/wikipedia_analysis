The '''East Asiatic Company''' (EAC) ({{lang-da|Det <U+00D8>stasiatiske Kompagni ''or'' <U+00D8>K}}) was founded by [[Hans Niels Andersen]] in [[Copenhagen]] in 1897.  Service which would eventually include both  passenger and freight lines between the Danish capital, [[Bangkok]] and the [[Far East|far east]] was the initial objective.  Routes to include the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s were established when in 1899, the subsidiary Russian East Asiatic Steamship Co. of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] was formed.  

[[Europe]]-[[Asia]] operations widened when the firm, ''Est Asiatique Francais'' of [[Paris]], followed in 1902, the new [[Danish West India Company]], in 1905 and the [[Siam Steam Navigation Company]], in 1908.  The second of these was eventually renamed Thai Navigation Co. after the [[Thailand|Thai]] government took it over in 1941.  For trade in the South of [[Africa]], the [[Swedish East Asiatic Company]] later began regular trips.  The subsidiary [[Russian American Line]] began sailing to [[North America]] in 1916, continuing until 1917.  Another, the [[Baltic American Line]], continued the service under the Danish flag from 1921 to 1930.  EAC was also involved in shipping for hire with [[tramp steamer|tramp]] operations beginning in 1915 under the subsidiary D/S A/S Orient of Copenhagen. 

In these middle years, business grew considerably.  The [[United Baltic Corporation]] was formed as a partnership with [[Andrew Weir, 1st Baron Inverforth|Andrew Weir]] & Co. in 1919. The early 1920s saw services extend from Copenhagen to [[South Africa]], [[Cuba]], [[Australia]], [[Mexico]] and [[North Pacific]] ports.  [[New York City|New York]] and, later, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] or [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]] were among the ports of call added for ships on the north Pacific route in 1940.  Connections between [[Vancouver]] and the far east were handled by Johnson Walton Steamships Ltd of Vancouver, when they were acquired in 1949.  

Most recently, cargo was the mainstay of the business.  As air travel became more popular in later years, passenger operations shrank until 1969, when they were discontinued.
