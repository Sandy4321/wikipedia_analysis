The band formed in [[Brisbane]] in 1989, and since 1992 their line-up has consisted of vocalist [[Bernard Fanning]], guitarists [[Darren Middleton]] and [[Ian Haug]], bassist [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]], and drummer [[Jon Coghill]].<ref name="band-members">{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#1p1|title=Who is in the band?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|date=23 September 2002|accessdate=25 October 2007|author=Rice, Stephen; et al.|publisher=Powderfinger Central}}</ref>

Powderfinger became a commercial success with their third studio album ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'' in 1998. Since then they have released several hit singles and award-winning works earning them a total of fifteen [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]], making them the most awarded band behind [[Silverchair]].<ref name="ARIA-history">{{cite web|url=http://ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&artist=Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger ARIA awards history|accessdate=8 August 2007|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]}}</ref> Numerous Powderfinger albums have reached multiple-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] status, as well as top 5 rankings in the weekly [[ARIA Charts|Australian music charts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/search.asp?search=powderfinger&cat=a|title=Powderfinger albums chart rankings|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=australian-charts.com}}</ref> ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', Powderfinger's most successful album to date, earned over eight platinum certifications and ARIA Awards in five different categories.<ref name="aria-accred-2004albums">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2004.htm|title=2004 Album Accreditations|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=3 November 2007}}</ref> 

After the release of their first DVD ''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'' and a "[[best of]]" release, Powderfinger announced a [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] in 2005. The announcement of a two month-long nationwide tour with [[Silverchair]] entitled [[Across the Great Divide tour|''Across the Great Divide'']] followed the release of their sixth studio album, ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]'' in June 2007.

Across their sixteen year career, Powderfinger has been actively involved in philanthropic causes. In 2005, Powderfinger performed at a [[WaveAid]] concert in Sydney, to help raise funds for areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. Another performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in October 2007 raised funds for [[breast cancer]] victims and their families. The aim of their recent [[Across the Great Divide tour]] was to promote the efforts of [[Reconciliation Australia]], and to promote awareness of the gap in life expectancy between [[Indigenous Australia|Indigenous]] and non-Indigenous children.<ref name="thedwarf" />

On the morning of Friday 9 April 2010 Powderfinger announced at a press conference that they would be breaking-up after their "Sunsets" tour, saying it would be their last ever as the band had musically said everything they wanted to say.<ref name="breakup">{{cite web|url=http://www.novafm.com.au/Article_Powderfinger-will-break-up-after-big-tour_99424;|title=Powderfinger will break up after big tour|accessdate=9 April 2010|date=9 April 2010|publisher=Nova}}</ref>

=== Early albums (1994<U+2013>98) ===
Powderfinger released their debut studio album ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]'' under Polydor on 18 July 1994. The album, which Fanning describes as the band's "dark days," received limited radio coverage.<ref name="hindleysite" /> Following the release, the band toured heavily appearing at the [[Livid]] and [[Homebake]] music festivals,<ref>{{cite news|title=Make mine a double|author=Lawrence, Angie|accessdate=25 October 2007|year=1996|publisher=''[[Rave (magazine)|Rave]]''}}</ref> including an appearance at one of Australia's largest [[List of Australian music festivals|music festivals]], [[Big Day Out]], in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigdayout.com/history/pastlineups.php#1994|title=Big Day Out lineups history|publisher=[[Big Day Out]]|accessdate=23 November 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030035145/http://www.bigdayout.com/history/pastlineups.php#1994 |archivedate = October 30, 2007}}</ref> Three singles were released from the album <U+2013> "[[Tail (song)|Tail]]", "[[Grave Concern]]", and "[[Save Your Skin]]". Following the album's release, and lukewarm reception, the group recorded and released another EP entitled ''Mr Kneebone'' in 1995.

The band released the highly successful ''[[Double Allergic]]'' on 2 September 1996. This, their second album, reached double platinum status in Australia.<ref name="aria-accred-2007albums">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesARIACharts-Accreditations-2007Albums.htm|title=2007  Album Accreditations|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=31 October 2007}}</ref> Four singles were released from the album <U+2013> "[[Pick You Up]]", "[[D.A.F.

=== Critical acclaim and chart success (1998<U+2013>2003) ===
In September 1998, Powderfinger released ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'', their third studio album. It propelled Powderfinger to a prominent position on the Australian music scene, reaching #1 and later spending 100 weeks on the [[ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/artist/facts/Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger - Audio, Video, News, Biography, Quick and Juicy facts|work=Powderfinger - Top 5 Facts|publisher=Take 40|accessdate=18 November 2007}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The album, which sold over 280,000 copies and went over five times platinum domestically,<ref name="FAQsales">{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#3p9|date=23 September 2002|title=How many copies of the albums have been sold?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|author=Rice, Stephen; et al.|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=8 August 2007}}</ref> reached European audiences for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Day Dream Believers|author=Six, Nicola|accessdate=26 October 2007|date=19 November 1998|publisher=''[[The Courier Mail]]''|work=Pulse}}</ref> ''Internationalist'' was the first Powderfinger album to win the [[ARIA Music Awards]].

The band received much praise and criticism for their political views on several tracks on ''Internationalist''. In an interview with Benedict Watts, guitarist Ian Haug said that the political messages in "[[The Day You Come]]" were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Beckoning Finger|date=November 1998|publisher=JUICE Magazine|accessdate=25 October 2007|author=Watts, Benedict}}</ref>

Powderfinger's fourth studio album, ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', was released in September 2000, shortly after they were asked to write songs for the soundtracks of two films; ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]''. The song "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]" was written for ''Two Hands''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=10528|title=''Two Hands'' soundtrack|publisher=Soundtrack Collector|accessdate=26 October 2007}}</ref> and "[[My Kind of Scene]]" was written for ''Mission: Impossible II''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/mykindascene.htm|title="My Kind of Scene"|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=19 June 2007}}</ref> ''Odyssey Number Five'' was Powderfinger's most successful album to-date, selling 560,000 copies.<ref name="aria-accred-2004albums" /> "My Kind of Scene" was also released as a single from the album, as were "[[My Happiness (Powderfinger song)|My Happiness]]", "[[Like a Dog]]", "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]", and "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]".<ref>"[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]" and "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]" were released as a double [[A-side]].</ref> ''Odyssey Number Five'' won "Album of the Year", "Highest Selling Album", "Best Rock Album", "Best Cover Art", and "Best Group" at the ARIA Awards in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/2001-aria.htm|title=2001 ARIA Award Winners|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=27 October 2007}}</ref> "My Happiness" was also awarded "Single of the Year",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=2001|title=ARIA Awards 2001|work=History|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref> and other songs were nominated for ARIA Awards in various other categories.<ref name="AllARIA">{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/total-aria.htm|title=Australia ARIA Award Winners|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=6 August 2007}}</ref>

[[Image:John Collins.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]], shown above in January 2005, is one of the original founding members of Powderfinger.]]

''[[Vulture Street]]'' was released on 4 July 2003. The album, recorded in January and February 2003, was named after a street in [[West End, Queensland]], which was the location of the band's first recording room. The album was described by critics as "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album", and that it featured guitarists Middleton and Haug dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut.<ref name="SMGVulture">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/10/1057783275797.html|title=Powderfinger, Vulture Street|author=Zuel, Bernard|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 August 2007}}</ref> Simon Evans of musicOMH.com described the band as having "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/powderfinger.htm|title=Vulture Street album review|publisher=musicOMH.com|accessdate=28 November 2007|author=Evans, Simon}}</ref>

"[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind]]", "[[Since You've Been Gone (Powderfinger song)|Since You've Been Gone]]", "[[Love Your Way]]", and "[[Sunsets]]" from ''Vulture Street'' were released as singles.  Like earlier Powderfinger albums, ''Vulture Street'' won several ARIA Awards. It won "Album of the Year", "Best Group", "Best Rock Album" and "Best Cover Art" in 2003.<ref name="AllARIA" /> Several songs on the album were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004.

''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'' was the first live release by Powderfinger. Both the [[CD]] and [[DVD]] versions were released in late-2004. One single,"[[Stumblin']]" a song which originally appeared on ''Vulture Street'' as a normal track, was also released from the album. Powderfinger released a "[[best of]]" album entitled ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994<U+2013>2000|Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000]]'' a few weeks later. It included many of the band's singles to-date as well as non-singles "[[Powderfinger's Oi Song Trilogy#Thrilloilogy|Thrilloilogy]]" and "Belter" and a re-release of "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]". "These Days", although never officially released as a single, was ranked at #1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999.<ref name="triplej-1999" /> The album also included two new songs; "[[Bless My Soul]]" and "Process This", although only "Bless My Soul" was released as a single. 

Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fund raising concert in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster affected areas.<ref name="waveaid-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/events/1673/|title=WaveAid @ Sydney Cricket Ground|publisher=FasterLouder|accessdate=8 August 2007|date=30 January 2005}}</ref> Fanning sang for [[The Wrights]] when they performed "[[Evie (song)|Evie]]" at the concert and released a studio version of the song as a single, with the proceeds from the sale also going to tsunami relief efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=3923|title=The Wrights|publisher=Australian Music Online|author=[[EMI]]|accessdate=3 December 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070906105411/http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=3923 |archivedate = September 6, 2007}}</ref>

=== Era of side projects (2005<U+2013>07) ===
Powderfinger had a period of hiatus after the release of ''Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger'' in 2005. During that time, several band members pursued other musical projects.

Their song "Drifting Further Away" features on the fifth season [[Grey's Anatomy]] episode 'Stairway to Heaven', which aired on 21 January 2009.

=== Golden Rule & The End (2010) ===

On 4 December 2008, the band announced on their official website that they were currently writing material for their 7th studio album.

On 16 June 2009, the following announcement was made on MySpace: "Saddle up 'Finger fans, it's the news you've been waiting for! This coming Monday 22 June Powderfinger are returning to the studio! Taking the helms for this album will again be Nick DiDia, responsible for Internationalist, Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture St! After recording their last album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in LA, the band are looking forward to recording the new album in Australia. While we don't have a release date as yet, you can expect to see the new album out at the end of 2009". On Thursday 10 September they announced that new album will be called Golden Rule and is set to be released on 13 November 2009.

In July 2009, Bernard Fanning spoke to Triple J radio to confirm the band as the 2009 Homebake Festival headline act, which sees the band return to the festival after a 10 year absence. He also suggested that the new album may include cameo performances from other Australian musicians. The album was recorded in Byron Bay on the New South Wales north coast. The band announced in early September that the title of their upcoming seventh album is ''[[Golden Rule (album)|Golden Rule]]'', which was released on 13 November 2009.

The album's first single was released to radio on 25 September 2009, and is titled "[[All of the Dreamers]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,26057648-10388,00.html|title=See old footage of Powderfinger and hear snippet of new single All Of The Dreamers|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref><ref name="heraldsun.com.au">http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/powderfinger-present-their-new-album-golden-rule/story-e6frf9hf-1225771607169</ref> Burn Your Name was the bands second single, which was released on the 18th of December 2009, just before they began touring at the 2010 Big Day Out. Their 3rd single will be Sail The Widest Stretch.

''Golden Rule'' debuted at number 1 on the ARIA albums chart.

On 9 April 2010, Powderfinger announced before media,<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/powderfinger-calls-it-quits-20100409-rw6a.html</ref> and on their website<ref name="powderfinger.com">http://www.powderfinger.com/sunsetstour</ref> that after 21 years, the group will disband as a touring and recording band following their 'Sunsets' tour in September and October 2010. In a statement read by Bernard Fanning, the band said:

<blockquote>''"With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule, we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group. We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date."''<ref name="powderfinger.com"/></blockquote>

In April 2010, radio station Nova106.9 revealed Brisbane's favourite Powderfinger song to the band in an interview about the farewell tour. The result was These Days and surprised Bernard Fanning who thought it was going to be My Happiness (that was second).

== Musical style ==
In an interview with Paul Cashmere after the release of ''Vulture Street'', guitarist Darren Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had written "were just too ''Odyssey Number Five'' based," and that the first track, "Rockin' Rocks", was "probably the start of where we were heading" with the album.<ref name="cashmere-interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/powderfinger.html|title=Powderfinger, Interview|author=Cashmere, Paul|accessdate=7 November 2007|archivedate=12 December 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5U1bvrQZw}}</ref> Cashmere stated in the interview that the album was "the toughest [he has] heard Powderfinger sound".<ref name="cashmere-interview" />

Bernard Zuel of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewed both of Powderfinger's more recent albums. Describing ''Vulture Street'' as "a rawer, louder" album in comparison to ''Odyssey Number Five'', Zuel highlighted Fanning's "talent as a lyricist" and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton "dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut."<ref name="SMGVulture" /> Zuel stated that there is a "real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger," and described "On My Mind" as having "[[AC/DC]] meatiness", and "Love Your Way" as "acoustic tumbling into weaving [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] lines."<ref name="SMGVulture" />

In his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', Zuel described it as "[having] high-gloss and muscular framework," and stated that that was what "American radio considers serious rock."<ref name="SMH-Dream Days" /> 

{{cquote2|1=Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy.

Clayton Bolger of [[Allmusic]] stated in his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' that Powderfinger "largely revisit the sound of their ''Internationalist'' album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's ''Vulture Street''."<ref name="dreamdays-amg">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gnfrxz95ldfe~T1|title=''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' review|publisher=Allmusic|author=Bolger, Clayton|accessdate=11 November 2007}}</ref> He commented on Fanning's "commanding and distinctive vocals," the "twin-guitar attack" of Middleton and Haug, Collins' "innovative basslines," and the "powerhouse drum work" of Coghill.<ref name="dreamdays-amg" />

[[Image:Powderfinger performing September 2007 (e).jpg|thumb|left|The Across the Great Divide tour was an attempt to promote [[Reconciliation Australia]]'s efforts in the [[Indigenous Australia|Indigenous]] community.]]
In their time as a band, Powderfinger have been active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances.

Powderfinger consists of five members: vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist and harmonicist Bernard Fanning, bass guitarist John Collins, guitarist and backing vocalist Ian Haug, guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Darren Middleton, and drummer and percussionist Jon Coghill. This has remained the lineup of the band since 1992. Steven Bishop had been the group's drummer before this, but had left wanting to focus on his studies.<ref name="band-members" /> The band often refers to one another with partial pseudonyms. Most notably John Collins and Jon Coghill, presumably to avoid confusion, are referred to as JC and Cogsy respectively.<ref name="cashmere-interview" />

Powderfinger have collaborated with few artists, but have had pianist [[Benmont Tench]] play on ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1898994.htm|title=New Powderfinger album details|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Triple J|accessdate=26 October 2007|date=17 April 2007}}</ref> For their second album, ''Double Allergic'', the group enlisted producer [[Tim Whitten]].
