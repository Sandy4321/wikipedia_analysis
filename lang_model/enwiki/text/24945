'''Hurricane Hazel''' was the deadliest and costliest [[hurricane]] of the [[1954 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The hurricane killed as many as 1,000&nbsp;people in [[Haiti]] before striking the United States near the border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 4|Category 4 hurricane]]. After causing 95 fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] storm, raising the death toll by 81 people, mostly in [[Toronto]]. As a result of its damaging effects and high death toll, its name was [[Tropical cyclone naming#Retirement|retired]] and will never again be used for a hurricane in the North Atlantic basin.

In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the economy for several years to come. The hurricane made landfall in the Carolinas, and destroyed most of waterfront dwellings near the point of impact. On its way towards Canada, it affected several more states, including [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]], bringing wind gusts near {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} and causing $308&nbsp;million (1954 [[USD]]) in damages. When Hazel came to Ontario, rivers and streams passing through the [[Greater Toronto Area]] overflowed their banks, causing severe flooding. As a result, many residential areas located in floodplains, such as the [[Raymore Drive]] area, were subsequently converted to parkland. In Canada alone, over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]135&nbsp;million (2009: $1.1&nbsp;billion) of damage was incurred.

Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto due to a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms, and the storm's unexpected retention of power. Hazel had traveled {{convert|1100|km|mi|abbr=on}} over land, but when it approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1&nbsp;million (2009: $41.7&nbsp;million) in aid.

In early October 1954, a [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of Africa and was spotted on October 5, roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the island of [[Grenada]]. Sufficiently organized to be deemed a hurricane, the original [[hurricane hunter]] wind measurement of of 110 km/h (70 mph) soon increased to 160 km/h (100 mph) at the centre, with a forward speed of 16 km/h (10 mph).<ref name="miami5">{{cite news|title=Hazel Packs 100-mi Winds in the Caribbean|accessdate=2010-03-15|author=Milt Sosin|date=1954-10-05|work=The Miami News|url= http://news.google.ca/newspapers?nid=71XFh8zZwT8C&dat=19541005&printsec=frontpage|page=1}}</ref> Hazel moved west and intensified from October 6 to October 9 in the [[Caribbean Sea]] without directly striking any land;<ref name="siec"/> at one point, it was moving "practically parallel" to the Venezuelan coast.<ref name="miami7"/> After continuing on a westward track, it turned sharply to the north-northeast, to take aim for Haiti instead of Jamaica, contrary to meteorologists' predictions.<ref name="miami10">{{cite news|accessdate=2010-03-15|title=Hazel Changes Course Sharply, Moves on Haiti|author=Milt Sosin|date=1954-10-11|work=The Miami News|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?nid=71XFh8zZwT8C&dat=19541011&printsec=frontpage|page=1}}</ref> As a whole, the storm proved to be very unpredictable, defying forecasts on multiple occasions.<ref name="siec"/> 

On October 11, Hazel crossed Haiti as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 2|Category 2 hurricane]].

Hurricane Hazel made landfall near the North Carolina/South Carolina border as a Category 3 storm, on the morning of October 15.

Moving very rapidly, Hazel consolidated with a [[Weather front|cold front]] and moved towards Ontario; by midnight, it was centred over downtown Toronto. The most rain fell around [[Brampton]], as it was where the original storm and the cold front merged. Hazel had still retained intensity equal to that of a Category 1 storm, with gusts of over {{convert|150|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, sustained winds as high as {{convert|124|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and rainfall in excess of {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, after moving almost {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} over land.<ref name="siec"/> Leaving Toronto, the storm slowed down considerably, from a maximum forward speed of {{convert|77|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} within the space of a day.

==Preparations==
On October 6, small craft warnings were issued for the Dutch islands of [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], despite predictions that Hazel would pass to the north.

American planes observed the intensifying storm in the Atlantic Ocean since it was spotted, and warnings were issued for Florida's east coast when Hazel began to approach Jamaica.<ref name="miami8"/> When the hurricane had passed Haiti and was tracking north, it was expected to lose power as it passed over cooler waters north of [[Florida]].<ref name="siec"/> Hazel was originally forecast to hit [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>Hairr, p. 130</ref> At 11 a.m. EDT on October 14 the National Weather Bureau issued a warning for the [[Carolinas]], with the caveat that the hurricane was expected to stay offshore and largely spare any land.

In her book, ''Hurricane Hazel'', Betty Kennedy argues that in Canada, the impressions that Hazel was "the best-kept secret in town" and that it was a "fully documented meteorological event that should have taken nobody by surprise" both "paradoxically [...] contain a great deal of truth".<ref>Kennedy, p. 36</ref> Meteorologists predicted that if Hazel merged with the cold front, the storm would not lose intensity, but instead potentially strengthen. Two Special Weather Bulletins were issued by the Dominion Weather Office, but since it was expected that  the storm would pass east of [[Toronto]], few other warnings were given and there were no evacuations, which increased the eventually property damage and loss of life.<ref name="siec"/> The forecast called for high winds between {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with only occasional showers. On lakes [[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]], ships received warnings about strong winds, and the predicted wind speeds ranged from {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name="siec"/> Toronto Hydro had called in standby crews as heavy winds were forecast, although they were almost sent home at one point due to a lull in the storm.<ref name="tlec"/>

There had been significant rainfall in the Toronto area in the two weeks prior to Hazel, so the ground was already saturated. Few people in Canada had any experience with hurricanes, since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as Toronto.<ref name="fi192">Filey, p. 192</ref> Kennedy also notes that if "Toronto had been about to face a blizzard, or was threatened by a 14-inch [36-cm] snowfall, ''that'' [sic] would have been something understandable. [...] This was different. This was the unknown, the unfamiliar, the totally unexpected crisis. Hurricanes belonged in the tropics."<ref>Kennedy, p. 44</ref>

Hazel struck [[Haiti]] on October 12 as a Category 2 storm. The hurricane brought flash floods which destroyed numerous villages, and high winds which caused considerable damage to major cities. The death toll was estimated to be as high as 1,000&nbsp;people; most of the casualties drowned when the water flowed in a flood down the mountains, some which were as high as {{convert|2400|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The situation was exacerbated by deforestation, which lessened the ability of the soil to hold water. Haiti's South Peninsula took the brunt of the storm: the largest town, [[Aux Cayes]], reported at least 200 casualties, while the second-largest town of [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie]] was reported to have been washed in the sea, with at least 200 more casualties.<ref name="miami13">{{cite news|title=Hazel's Toll is 200 Dead; 500 Hurt in Haiti|author=Milt Sosin|date=1954-10-13|work=The Miami News|accessdate=2010-03-15|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?nid=71XFh8zZwT8C&dat=19541013&printsec=frontpage|page=1}}</ref> Damage in Aux Cayes was estimated to be $500,000 (1954 USD).<ref name="beaver13"/> Estimates of people left homeless in the wake of Hazel are as high as 100,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/724028821.html?dids=724028821:724028821&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+16%2C+2004&author=BOB+BURTT&pub=The+Record&desc=Hazel%27s+lessons+learned&pqatl=google|page=B.1|author=Bob Burtt|title=Hazel's Lessons Learned|date=2004-10-26|work=The Record|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>   Hazel destroyed about 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the country's economy for several years.<ref>Rotberg and Clague, p. 182</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00816FB395E107B93C7A9178AD85F418585F9|title=Hurricane Dents Economy of Haiti|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-14|date=1956-01-05}}</ref>  Objects from Haiti, such as bowls, were reported to have been transported by the hurricane to the Carolinian coast.<ref name="cent22">Gifford, p. 22</ref>

After leaving Haiti, Hazel went north towards the Bahamas. Since the hurricane passed largely east of the islands, only minor damage was reported. Hazel passed directly over [[Inagua]], where it claimed six lives when a sailboat capsized while taking shelter from the storm.<ref name="NOAA2">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easy_1951-60.htm|title=Hurricane of 1954|date=1954-12|accessdate=2010-04-03|publisher=NOAA|author=Walter R.

===United States===
Contrary to predictions, Hurricane Hazel regained strength over the Atlantic Ocean. Hazel made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near [[Calabash, North Carolina]], close to the North Carolina/South Carolina state border, halfway between [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. At landfall, the hurricane brought a [[storm surge]] of over {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a large area of coastline, producing severe coastal damage; the damage was greater since the hurricane coincided with the highest lunar tide of the year.<ref name="noaanc">{{cite web|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/products/nchaz/htm/hazel.htm|title=Hurricane Hazel|work=Coastal Service Center|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2009-06-14}}</ref> [[Brunswick County, North Carolina]], suffered the heaviest damage, where most coastal dwellings were either completely destroyed or severely damaged. For example, in [[Long Beach, North Carolina]], only five of the 357 buildings were left standing.<ref name="cent22"/> About 80% of waterfront dwellings in Myrtle Beach were also destroyed. As a result of the high storm surge, the low-lying sandy barrier islands were completely flooded.<ref>Hairr, p. 134</ref> The official report from the Weather Bureau in Raleigh, North Carolina stated that as a result of Hazel, "all traces of civilization on the immediate waterfront between the state line and Cape Fear were practically annihilated."<ref name="nc135">Hairr, p. 135</ref> The December 1954 NOAA report on the hurricanes of the year states that "every pier in a distance of 170 miles [270 kilometres] of coastline was demolished".<ref name="NOAA2"/>

At the Raleigh-Durham Airport in North Carolina, sustained winds of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} with gusts of {{convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were recorded. With such high winds state-wide, heavy damage was caused to forests, and to property as a result of falling trees. However, since the Carolinas, like the rest of the Southeastern United States, were suffering from a severe drought, the heavy rainfall brought by Hazel was welcome. In North Carolina, the most rain was received in the interior of the state: [[Robbins, North Carolina|Robbins]] received {{convert|286|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain, and [[Carthage, North Carolina|Carthage]] received {{convert|247|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="nc135"/>

Nineteen people were killed in North Carolina, with several hundred more injured; 15,000 homes were destroyed and another 39,000 were damaged.<ref name="noaanc"/> Damages in the Carolinas amounted to $163&nbsp;million. Beach property incurred $61 million of damage alone, while North Carolina took the brunt of the property damage, as only $25&nbsp;million in damage occured in South Carolina. Elsewhere in the United States, damages were estimated at $145&nbsp;million for a total of $308&nbsp;million in losses from the hurricane.<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Walter R.

While Hazel caused the most damage in the Carolinas, the storm did not lose all of its intensity. Going north, Hazel turned extratropical by midday when it merged with a cold; however, it retained hurricane-strength winds and it was continuing to drop heavy rainfall. After leaving North Carolina, the storm went through [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]]. In general, power was knocked out and trees were downed. Wind gusts throughout the area reached {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.<ref name="NOAA2"/><ref name="miami16"/>

Rain amounts were heavier on the western side of the storm. In West Virginia, the average amount of rain received was {{convert|230|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} with localised amounts of {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} were reported in the Appalachians. To the east, the Washington, D.C. area was particularly affected, and considerable flooding was reported in Virginia and Maryland. New Jersey escaped major flooding as the high tide was low enough, but to the south in [[Chesapeake Bay]], the majority of crab pots were destroyed.<ref>Hairr, p. 136</ref> Hazel lost a considerable amount of moisture when crossing the Allegheny Mountains, which raised rivers and streams in the [[Pittsburgh]] area significantly above the flood mark. In Pennsylvania, the winds were still high enough to unroof several homes. In upstate New York, the stormed blocked highways and railroads.<ref name="miami16">{{cite news|title=Floods Rise in Hazel's Wake|author=AP|date=1954-10-16|work=The Miami News|accessdate=2010-03-15|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?nid=71XFh8zZwT8C&dat=19541016&printsec=frontpage|e|page=1}}</ref>

When the storm arrived, the water table was already saturated; as a result, most of the precipitation<U+2014>with estimates as high as 90%<U+2014>simply ran off into rivers and creeks in Toronto, which raised water levels by as much as six to eight metres.<ref name="siec"/> Areas slightly to the west of Toronto proper received significantly more rain than to east: [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], near [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], received {{convert|214|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the most of any Canadian location, while both Snelgrove and Brampton reported {{convert|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} in three hours, between 9 p.m. and midnight on October 15.<ref name="siec"/><ref name="fi192"/> Anything built in the floodplain of a major waterway was either inundated or simply swept away.

Numerous roads and railways were also washed out. <ref name="trans">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=FE4D3A3F-1|title=Impacts&nbsp;<U+2014> Transportation}}</ref><ref name="impec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=En&n=FE71002F-1|title=Impacts}}</ref>

The [[Holland Marsh]] is located in a bowl-shaped valley directly south of Lake Simcoe, near [[Bradford, Ontario|Bradford]]. Unlike the flash floods in rivers and creeks to the south, the flooding of Holland Marsh was slow, which allowed people to avoid drowning by escaping to Bradford, which is located on a hill. Property damage was severe: Allan Andreson, a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] reporter, said that the "marsh was just like one vast lake. All you could see in the distance sticking out of the water was the steeple of the Springdale Christian Reformed Church".<ref>Kennedy, p. 101</ref> [[Highway 400 (Ontario)|Highway 400]], which passes through the marsh, was under as much as {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of water in some places when as much {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of water backed up. The economic losses were also hard. While most of the year's crop had been harvested by mid-October, it had not been brought in, so it was either submerged or swept away by the flood; in addition, any produce that came into contact with flood was deemed to be unfit for consumption and had to be destroyed.<ref>Kennedy, p. 103</ref> The original effort to drain the Marsh by Toronto Hydro was unsuccessful as their pumps were getting clogged by produce, and other debris. Through numerous donations, better equipment was obtained, and the Holland Marsh was drained by November 13.<ref>Kennedy, p. 105</ref> Fears that the marsh would become infertile after the flood were allayed with above-average harvests in the following years.<ref>Kennedy, p. 106</ref>

The [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]], in the west end of the city, caused the most destruction as a result of an intense flash flood. With no flood control in place and most minor rivers and creeks draining into it, a flash flood ensued. The resulting current was so strong that the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that the police were told that "nothing can make it and anyone in it will be killed for sure", when referring to launching a rescue boat.<ref name="hrec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=BD91538F-1|title=Impacts&nbsp;<U+2014> Humber River}}</ref> That prediction came true when a team of five volunteer firefighters were killed when their fire truck was swept away as they were responding to help a stranded motorist.<ref name="fi193">Filey, p. 193</ref> Communities along the Humber which were located in its floodplain were devastated: at Woodbridge, the river swelled from its usual width of {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}} at its narrowest point, and left hundreds homeless and nine dead. Of the 81 Canadian fatalities, 35 lived on [[Raymore Drive]]. Located parallel to the river, {{convert|366|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the road and 14 homes, many with their occupants inside, were swept away by the Humber. The rise of the river was unprecedented and the residents did not evacuate, which led to the high death toll. The damage was so severe that the area along Raymore Drive and the surrounding neighbourhood which had been flooded was converted from a residential area into a park.<ref name="hrec"/>

Further west, the [[Etobicoke Creek]] also overflowed its banks at the village of Long Branch, located near Lake Ontario, which caused heavy flooding. Seven people were killed, as many dwellings were swept into the lake.<ref name="lbec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=19D1EDC8-1|title=Impacts&nbsp;<U+2014> Long Branch}}</ref> That area of the village was also converted into a park. On the east side of Toronto, areas near the Don River received some flooding, but it was not as severe due to the substantially smaller amount of rainfall in that end of the city.<ref name="donec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=6A9B162F-1|title=Impacts&nbsp;<U+2014> Don River}}</ref>

The death of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural disaster in Canada. In addition to the casualties, over 4,000 families were left homeless.<ref name="gif13">Gifford, p. 13</ref> The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada estimates the total cost of Hurricane Hazel for Canada, taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption, the cost of lost property, and recovery costs, to be [[Canadian dollar|C$]]137,552,400 (2009: $1,126,947,163).<ref name="evec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=E1111740-1|title=Recovery&nbsp;<U+2014> Evaluation}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
===Haiti===
In the aftermath of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With existing infrastructure already poor, the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). [[Pan American World Airways]] offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid,<ref name="miami14"/> and the US aircraft carrier [[USS Saipan (CVL-48)|USS ''Saipan'']] deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies.<ref name="miami15">{{cite news|title=Big Scale Relief Is Pushed In Hurricane-Battered Haiti|author=AP|date=1954-10-15|work=The Miami News|accessdate=2010-03-15|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?nid=71XFh8zZwT8C&dat=19541015&printsec=frontpage|page=9A}}</ref> Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] following Hazel due to a lack of clean water.<ref>Kennedy, p. 31</ref>

===United States===
In the Carolinas, the National Guard was mobilised by the evening of October 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline. On October 17, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] declared a "major disaster" in the Carolinas, and offered "immediate and unlimited federal assistance."<ref name="time">{{cite news|work=Time Magazine|date=1954-10-25|accessdate=2010-03-15|title=The Americas: Hazel's Fling|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823583,00.html}}</ref> Recovery was quick, and by October 24, all but two units were demobilised. Another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts. An artificial sand dune barrier, {{convert|39|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, was completed by October 30, which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes. With Myrtle Beach a popular tourist destination, the Chamber of Commerce began an information campaign to inform the public, which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed, that the city would be ready for the coming summer. The rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform Myrtle Beach from a "quaint summer colony to a high-rise resort city".<ref name="st178-9">Stokes, pp. 178<U+2013>179</ref>

===Canada===
{{main article|Effects of Hurricane Hazel in Canada}}
[[File:Humber Weir.JPG|left|300 px|thumb|A [[weir]] was built on the Humber River near Raymore Drive to lessen the risk of a similar catastrophic flood.|alt=Water flows over a low dam over a river; one tree-lined bank of the river is visible.]]
Eight hundred troops<U+2014>fifteen militia groups and eight army reserve units<U+2014>were summoned to Toronto to assist with the cleanup. Local members of the navy assisted by providing boats and 100 men. The army donated 900 blankets, 350 mattresses, 175 double-decker beds, and 150 stretchers. Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort: the [[Salvation Army]] received so many donations of clothes, footwear, blankets, food, and money that its storage facilities were overfilled, forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed.<ref name="raec"/> 

The Hurricane Relief Fund was established to "receive contributions from all those citizens in this province and elsewhere who desire to assist those who have lost so much." It received donations from organisations, companies and individuals including [[Pope Pius XII]], the [[Ford Motor Company]], the [[United Church of Canada]], Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British American Oil Company. Approximately $5,100,000 (2009: $41,750,000) was distributed from a total fund of about $5,300,000 (2009: $43,000,000), with half the remainder set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims, and the other half going to cover administrative expenses.<ref name="raec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n=E1111740-1|title=Recovery&nbsp;<U+2014> Aftermath}}</ref>

In the aftermath of Hurricane Hazel, the [[Toronto and Region Conservation Authority]] was created though the merger of smaller, regional conservation authorities, with the mission to manage the area's floodplains and rivers. For instance, there had been previously rejected plans to build dams along the Humber River to control flooding; after the storm, some were built, but they would not prevent flooding in another weather event comparable to Hazel's severity and under similar circumstances.<ref name="mitec"/> After the flooding brought on by Hazel, flood control in Ontario and Canada as a whole became a more important issue.<ref>Cullingworth, pp. 249<U+2013>253</ref>

Land in heavily flooded areas was expropriated, and policies were instituted to prevent home construction and other development projects in ravines or floodplains. Most of this expropriated land was converted into parkland. Between [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] and Lake Ontario, the Humber River is now parkland,<ref name="mitec">{{cite web|author=Peter Bowyer|year=2004|accessdate=2009-06-17|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=En&n=CA3BC939-1|title=Mitigation}}</ref> while what was Raymore Drive at the time of the storm was turned into Raymore Park, which contains a footbridge over the Humber dedicated to the victims.<ref name="gif99">Gifford, p. 99</ref>

===Retirement===
As a result of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the Caribbean, United States and Canada, the name Hazel was retired, and will never again be used for an [[Atlantic hurricane]]. However, since it was retired before the inception of naming lists with the modern six-year cycle, it was not directly replaced with any particular name.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=2009-04-22|accessdate=2009-06-21|title=Retired Hurricane Names Since 1954|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml}}</ref>
