'''Dr. Lewis Heisler Ball''' ([[September 21]] [[1861]] &ndash; [[October 18]] [[1932]]) was an [[United States |American]] [[physician]] and [[politician]] from [[Mill Creek Hundred]], [[New Castle County, Delaware |New Castle County]], [[Delaware]], near Stanton. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican Party]], who served as [[United States Representative |U.S. Representative from Delaware]] and two terms as [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator from Delaware]]. He was known by his middle name.

==Early life and family==
Ball was born [[September 21]] [[1861]] in [[Mill Creek Hundred]], [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Delaware]]. He attended the Rugby Academy at [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and graduated from the [[University of Delaware|Delaware College]] at [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], [[Delaware]] in 1882. He received his medical degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and began the practice of medicine at Brandywine Springs, near [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]] in 1887. 

==The Addicks Era==
At the turn of the twentieth century [[Delaware]] was going through a political transformation. Most obvious to the public was the bitter division in the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican Party]] caused, in part, by the ambitions of J. Edward Addicks for a seat in the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senate]]. A gas company industrialist, he spent vast amounts of his own fortune to build a [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican Party]], with that purpose in mind. Largely successful in heavily [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democratic]] [[Kent County, Delaware |Kent County]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], he financed the organization of a faction that came to be known as "Union Republicans". Meanwhile he was making bitter enemies of the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] "[[Republican Party (United States) |Regular Republicans]]", many of whom considered him nothing more than a [[carpetbagger]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |Philadelphia]].

Ball was a [[Republican Party (United States) |Regular Republican]], and an outspoken opponent of Addicks. As such he was elected [[Treasurer |State Treasurer]] of [[Delaware]] from 1899 to 1901. He was then elected to the [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1900. During this term, he served with the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican]] majority in the [[57th United States Congress|57th Congress]] from [[March 4]] [[1901]] until [[March 3]] [[1903]]. This was during the administrations of [[President of the United States |U.S. Presidents]] [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

In 1899, one of the [[United States Senator|U.S. Senate]] seats came open and the Union Republicans in the [[Delaware General Assembly]] were committed to electing Addicks. Without the votes to do so, they were able to block the election of anyone else. As a result, one of [[Delaware]]'s [[United States Senate |U.S. Senate]] seats remained vacant for four years, and when the other came open, it too was left vacant due to the deadlock. Finally, in 1903, the matter became national news and too much of an embarrassment to continue. Addicks relented and allowed Ball to be elected to the remaining two years left on the first seat and Addicks' lieutenant, [[J. Frank Allee]] was elected to the second seat. 

==United States Senator==
Accordingly, Ball was elected to the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senate]] on [[March 2]] [[1903]], and served the remaining two years of the term with the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican]] majority in the [[58th United States Congress |58th Congress]]. But the controversy was not over. In 1905, when Ball's term ended, the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] again deadlocked and it took another two years to fill the seat. In the meantime, Addicks suffered major business setbacks and ceased to be a political factor. Regardless, the repeated inability of the [[Delaware General Assembly]] to fulfill this constitutional duty contributed strong evidence throughout the nation of the need for the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution |Seventeenth Amendment]] providing for the popular election of [[United States Senate |U.S. Senators]].

Several years later, in the second popular election of a [[United States Senate |U.S. Senator]] in [[Delaware]], Ball was again elected to the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senate]], this time in 1918, defeating incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democratic]] [[United States Senate |U.S. Senator]] [[Willard Saulsbury, Jr.]] During this term, Ball served with the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican]] majority in the [[66th United States Congress|66th]], [[67th United States Congress|67th]], and [[68th United States Congress|68th U.S. Congress]]. In the [[66th United States Congress |66th Congress]] he was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills and in the [[67th United States Congress |67th]] and [[68th United States Congress |68th Congress]] he was a member of the Committee on the District of Columbia. He was also appointed as a member of the rent commission of [[Washington, D.C. |Washington]]. 

In June 1919 he cast his vote in favor of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution |Nineteenth Amendment]] providing for Women's suffrage. Despite this, a year later, when [[Delaware]] had the opportunity to be the 36th and decisive state to ratify the amendment and make it law, supporters in the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] failed to get the needed votes and the honor passed to [[Tennessee]].

Ball was never considered an especially effective [[United States Senate |U.S. Senator]] in terms of gaining patronage for [[Delaware]]. However, he ensured his eventual defeat by becoming a rival of [[T. Coleman du Pont]], the former President of [[DuPont |E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], and the effective leader of the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican Party]] in [[Delaware]]. Du Pont had hoped to be the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican]] candidate for [[President of the United States |U.S. President]] in 1920, but his efforts began to collapse when Ball deserted him after the first ballot at the [[1920 Republican National Convention]]. Then, in 1922, Ball failed to support du Pont as he sought a full term in the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senate]] himself. By 1924 [[T. Coleman du Pont |du Pont]] thought he had a score to settle and defeated Ball for their party<U+2019>s nomination for a full term in 1924.

In all, Ball served two separate terms, the first from [[March 4]] [[1903]] until [[March 3]] [[1905]], during the administration of [[President of the United States |U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and the second from [[March 4]] [[1919]] to [[March 3]] [[1925]], during the administrations of [[President of the United States |U.S. Presidents]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Warren G. Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge]].

==Death and legacy==
Ball died [[October 18]] [[1932]] at Faulkland, near [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], and is buried in St. James Episcopal Church Cemetery in [[Mill Creek Hundred]], [[Delaware]], near Stanton.

==Public offices==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after [[November 1]]. The [[Treasurer |State Treasurer]] takes office the third Tuesday of January and had a two year term. [[United States Senate |U.S. Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives |U.S. Representatives]] took office March 4th and have terms of six years and two years respectively. Before 1913, the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] elected the [[United States Senate |U.S. Senators]], and afterwards they were popularly elected.
