The '''emerald cockroach wasp''' or '''jewel wasp''' (''Ampulex compressa'') is a  solitary [[wasp]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Ampulicidae]]. It is known for its unusual [[biological reproduction|reproductive behavior]], which involves stinging a [[cockroach]] and using it as a host for its [[larva]]e. It thus belongs to the [[entomophagous parasite]]s.

==Distribution==
The wasp is mostly found in the tropical regions of [[South Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Pacific islands]]. The flying wasps are more abundant in the warm seasons of the year.

''A. compressa'' was introduced to [[Hawaii]] by F.X. Williams in 1941 as a method of [[biocontrol]]. This has been unsuccessful because of the territorial tendencies of the wasp, and the small scale on which they hunt.<ref name=williams/>

==Appearance==
The wasp has a metallic blue-green body, with the thighs of the second and third pair of legs red. The female is about 22&nbsp;mm long; the male is smaller and lacks a [[stinger]].<ref name=williams>Williams, F. X. (1942) "''Ampulex compressa'' (Fabr.), a cockroach-hunting wasp introduced from New Caledonia into Hawaii". ''Proc. Hawaiian Entomological Society'', 11:221<U+2013>233.</ref>

==Reproductive behavior and life cycle==
As early as the 1940s it was reported that female wasps of this species sting a roach (specifically a ''[[Periplaneta americana]]'', ''[[Periplaneta australasiae]]'' or ''[[Nauphoeta rhombifolia]]''<ref name=williams/>) twice, delivering venom. A 2003 study<ref>*Gal Haspel, Lior Ann Rosenberg and Frederic Libersat (2003): [http://www.bgu.ac.il/life/Faculty/Libersat/pdf/JNB.2003b.pdf Direct Injection of Venom by a Predatory Wasp into Cockroach Brain], ''[[Journal of Neurobiology]]'', 56 (4):287<U+2013>292 {{DOI|10.1002/neu.10238}}
</ref> using [[radioactive tracer|radioactive labeling]] demonstrated that the wasp stings precisely into specific [[ganglion|ganglia]] of the roach. It delivers an initial sting to a [[thoracic]] ganglion and injects venom to mildly and reversibly [[paralysis|paralyze]] the front legs of its victim. This facilitates the second venomous sting at a carefully chosen spot in the roach's head ganglia ([[brain]]), in the section that controls the [[escape reflex]]. As a result of this sting, the roach will first groom extensively, and then become sluggish and fail to show normal escape responses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gal|first=Ram|coauthors=Rosenberg, Lior Ann; Libersat, Frederic|date=22 November 2005|title=Parasitoid wasp uses a venom cocktail injected into the brain to manipulate the behavior and metabolism of its cockroach prey|journal=Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology|volume=60|issue=4|pages=198<U+2013>208|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112152224/abstract|doi=10.1002/arch.20092|pmid=16304619}}</ref> In 2007 it was reported that the venom of the wasp blocks receptors for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[octopamine]].<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/071129/full/news.2007.312.html How to make a zombie cockroach], ''Nature News'', 29 September 2007</ref>

The wasp proceeds to chew off half of each of the roach's [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e.<ref name=williams/> Researchers believe that the wasp chews off the antenna to replenish fluids or possibly to regulate the amount of venom because too much could kill and too little would let the victim recover before the larva has grown.
The wasp, which is too small to carry the roach, then leads the victim to the wasp's [[burrow]], by pulling one of the roach's antennae in a manner similar to a leash. Once they reach the burrow, the wasp lays a white egg, about 2&nbsp;mm long, on the roach's [[abdomen]]. It then exits and proceeds to fill in the burrow entrance with pebbles, more to keep other [[predator]]s out than to keep the roach in.

With its escape reflex disabled, the stung roach will simply rest in the burrow as the wasp's egg hatches after about three days. The hatched larva lives and feeds for 4<U+2013>5 days on the roach, then chews its way into its abdomen and proceeds to live as an [[endoparasitoid]]. Over a period of eight days, the wasp larva consumes the roach's internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] in an order which guarantees that the roach will stay alive, at least until the larva enters the [[pupa]]l stage and forms a [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] inside the roach's body. Eventually the fully grown wasp emerges from the roach's body to begin its adult life. Development is faster in the warm season.

Adults live for several months. Mating takes about one minute, and only one mating is necessary for a female wasp to successfully parasitize several dozen roaches.

While a number of [[venomous animal]]s paralyze prey as live food for their young, ''Ampulex compressa'' is different in that it initially leaves the roach mobile and modifies its behavior in a unique way.
Several other species of the genus ''[[Ampulex]]'' show a similar behavior of preying on cockroaches.<ref name=williams/> The wasp's predation appears only to affect the cockroach's escape responses. Research has shown that while a stung roach exhibits drastically reduced survival instincts (such as swimming, or avoiding pain) for approximately 72 hours, motor abilities like flight or flipping over are unimpaired.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/06/the_wasp_that_walks_cockroaches.php|title=The wasp that walks cockroaches|last=Yong|first=Ed|date=June 5, 2008|publisher=Not Exactly Rocket Science News|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Libersat|first=Frederic|date=June 27, 2003|title=Wasp uses venom cocktail to manipulate the behavior of its cockroach prey|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=189|url=http://www.bgu.ac.il/life/Faculty/Libersat/pdf/JCP.2003.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>
