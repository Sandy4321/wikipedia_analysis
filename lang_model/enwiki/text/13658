'''Mother Mary Alphonsa''' (May 20, 1851 &ndash; July 9, 1926) was an [[United States|American]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[Nun#Distinction between nun and religious sister|religious sister]] and [[social worker]].

==Biography==
Mother Alphonsa was born on May 20, 1851 to [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and his wife [[Sophia Hawthorne]], and [[baptism|baptised]] as '''Rose Hawthorne'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Valenti|first=Patricia Dunvalay|title=To Myself a Stranger: A Biography of Rose Hawthorne Lathrop|year=1991|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807124734}}</ref>{{rp|1}} She lived in Massachusetts, Liverpool, England, then London, Paris, Rome, and Florence, Italy. The family returned to Concord, Massachusetts in 1860.  Her mother and the family moved to Germany, then England.  She married author [[George Parsons Lathrop]] in 1871; both converted to [[Roman Catholic]]ism in 1891. In 1876, the couple had a son, Francis, who died of [[diphtheria]] at the age of five. Afterwards Rose and George separated permanently in 1895.

After her father's death in 1864, she tried to become an author, like him. She wrote book of poems, ''Along the Shore'', which was published in 1888. She later decided to rededicate her life to restoring her family's reputation after her brother [[Julian Hawthorne]]'s illegal activities.

She was known for her service near and within [[New York City]], caring for impoverished [[cancer]] by founding [http://www.saintroseshome.org St. Rose's Free Home for Incurable Cancer] in the Lower East Side. After George's death in 1898, she became a nun and founded a community of [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] religious, now known as the [[Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne]]. It has been said she was inspired in part by the death of poet [[Emma Lazarus]], whom she befriended in 1881.<ref>Young, Bette Roth. ''Emma Lazarus in Her World: Life and Letters''. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1995: 186. ISBN 0-8276-0618-4</ref>

Rose Hawthorne Lathrop was awarded an honorary [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)]] from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1925. She died a year later on July 9, 1926. In 2003, [[Edward Egan]], Cardinal Archbishop of the [[Archdiocese of New York]] approved the movement for Lathrop's canonization. She now has the title "[[Servant of God]]" in the Catholic Church.
