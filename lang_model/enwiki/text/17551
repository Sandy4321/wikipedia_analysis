==Storylines==
===1995<U+2013>96===
Carly Tenney is the daughter of Ray Tenney and Sheila Washburn. Carly originally came to town in search of her "cousin" [[Rosanna Cabot]] and the Cabot fortune. When Carly was little, Sheila abandoned her, married Alexander Cabot and gave birth to Rosanna. Ray married Sheila's sister, Lee, and raised Carly as her own daughter.

Carly had a one night stand with a man she met in a bar soon after arriving in town, whom she later learned was [[Mike Kasnoff|Michael "Mike" Kasnoff]], Rosanna's fianc<U+00E9>. Carly tried everything she could to destroy their relationship. After Mike and Rosanna's wedding was called off, he and Carly slept together again and she became pregnant. Mike and Rosanna reconciled but Carly used the pregnancy to get closer to Mike. Rosanna became jealous of Carly and offered to buy Carly's baby. Carly at first refused but later used the offer in another attempt to end Mike and Rosanna's relationship. During a confrontation with Rosanna, Carly fell and went into premature labor. She gave birth to a stillborn, who she named Nora Kasnoff. Carly left to go to Hong Kong.

===1997<U+2013>2010===
Once she was back in Oakdale, Carly met Brad Snyder. She fell in love with Brad's brother, Jack. Her sister Rosanna agreed to provide Carly's child with a 50 million dollar trust fund if she would have the baby with a man to whom she was married (who was not Mike). Growing impatient, she later gave Carly a deadline: midnight the end of 1998. Unfortunately for Carly, the deadline was given in the late winter of 1998, giving her little time to get pregnant. She wanted to have Jack's baby, but he was injured in the line of duty and could not have sex. Deciding that the money was more important than her love for Jack (or feeling she could get him back later), she seduced Hal Munson. After they married, she was unsure whether she was pregnant, so as the end of March neared, Carly got desperate and enlisted John Dixon to inseminate her. In the meantime, Carly continued to pine for Jack, and Hal sensed this, leading to their divorce. Soon after, she found that her due date was in January, indicating that John was the likely father and not Hal. So she quickly married John so fulfill Rosanna's terms. As 1999 loomed, Carly decided to induce labor early to ensure her trust fund, but John refused to risk the baby's safety since the plan was for him to raise the child when it was born. However, when Carly felt a contraction in her 8th month, she had a change of heart and decided that she was keeping this child, money or no money. Not long after, fate intervened and miraculously, Jack delivered Carly's baby boy on New Year's Eve<U+2014>mere minutes before the deadline. John named the baby Parker after his mother's maiden name.

Brad found out from Molly Conlon that Hal Munson was the baby's true father and he used this information to blackmail Carly into marrying him. Once Carly found out, she demanded a divorce (believing Rosanna would still give her the trust fund). Brad agreed to the divorce when Carly promised to pay him five million dollars to sign the divorce papers. Brad just had one request, and that was Carly had to sleep with him one time. Reluctantly Carly agreed. When Carly went to collect her money from Rosanna, she refused to give Carly a dime. Brad was furious at Carly and wanted his money, or revenge. Brad made a public announcement at Hal and Barbara Munson's wedding that Hal was the father to Carly's baby. Jack was mad at Carly for putting herself in this predicament. When things cooled down and Jack wasn't so mad at Carly, they started getting closer. They eventually fell in love. 

Carly became a well-known fashion designer. She was always in competition with Barbara Ryan, who owned her own line of clothing. Carly was offered a temporary position to substitute for Barbara when Barbara was hurt in an explosion. Paul wanted to keep this a secret from his mother so she wouldn't get mad. Barbara found out and was furious. She had Carly, Emily Stewart and Rose D'Angelo kidnapped and taken out of the country, with the help of James Stenbeck. While kidnapped, the women were injected with a serum that would age them very quickly. When Carly was found, she couldn't bare to let anyone look at her. She refused to let Jack love her, and didn't want him to feel obligated to be with her. She also thought that Jack would eventually get tired of looking at her and leave her. But she was wrong. Jack vowed to stay by her side, no matter what. They finally came up with another serum that reversed the effects, and Carly was back to normal. 

Carly and Jack stayed together and got married, but tragedy was just around the corner for the happy couple. One day, Jack was escorting a prisoner back to the Oakdale police department when the car went off a bridge. Jack was never found, but Carly never gave up on him. When everyone was moving on with their lives, Carly, with the help of Parker, decided to find him. Her gut feeling was right. Jack was indeed alive. He was suffering from amnesia. A nurse who took care of him in the hospital brought him to her home, fell in love with him and they married, but it wasn't a legal marriage because he was still married to Carly. After taking him to court, Carly had Jack court ordered to live with her and the kids until one day he got his memory back and realized that he was in love with Carly. For a while, Jack was torn between Carly and Julia. He finally made his decision to stay married to the love of his life, Carly. Julia was hurt but she moved on. Unfortunately, Julia was murdered by her ex-husband. With his mother dead and his dad in prison, Julia's little boy, JJ was awarded to Jack and Carly. 

Through the years, Carly has been in and out of love with Jack. Just when Jack took her back, Carly did something behind his back that had him mad at her again. After years of fighting with Carly, Jack finally left her, maybe for good. Saddened over the breakup, Carly eventually decided to move on with her life and accept the fact that Jack would not return. She fell in love with Simon Frasier, who had hired her to design. Carly liked his wild spirit because it reminded her of herself. Unfortunately, Simon and Carly got in trouble with a diamond that was stolen from a prince. This time, Jack couldn't get her out of this mess. She ended up running from the law, and Jack. She left behind a wonderful life that she had worked so hard to establish, and three wonderful children.

When Carly returned to Oakdale, she set about making Jack see they were meant to be together but he was already involved with Katie Peretti. JJ was kidnapped by associates of Julia and Carly managed to follow Jack all over the country to find him. Together, they rescued JJ but Jack would still not consider a reconciliation. As his wedding to Katie neared, Carly began having headaches and passing out but she kept her symptoms to herself. Brad eventually discovered what was going on and convinced her to see a doctor. Carly was diagnosed with brain lesions and told she had only a few weeks to live.

She swore Brad to secrecy but Brad kept pressing her to come forward. He eventually spilled the beans to Jack who moved back in with Carly, even though he had just married Katie, for the kids' sake. Soon after, Carly learned she had been misdiagnosed and wasn't dying but again persuaded Brad to keep the secret so that she could truly win Jack's heart. Brad, in love with Katie, agreed but it became very hard for him to keep the secret. Carly convinced Jack to come away with her to Montana and they had sympathy sex. Brad couldn't believe it when she told him. Soon after, Katie realized the truth and decided to leave Jack. Carly begged Brad to keep quiet and then proposed to Jack herself. He accepted, again for the kids' sake.

Katie figured out what was really going on and on their wedding day went to the church. She couldn't out Carly, though, and left. At the altar, Carly had an epiphany and decided to tell Jack the truth. He left her on the spot. Still not over him, she tried several times to make her see that he truly loved her but Jack wouldn't admit it.
With Jack presenting a stony front and Lily out of town, Carly had no one to turn to except Holden. They became sympathetic friends, each trying to get over their exes. Soon their friendship grew and they began having an affair. Not wanting to ruin the one good relationship she had left - her friendship with Lily - Carly called a halt to the affair but Holden was too deeply involved. He told Lily the truth and she left him. Lily placed all the blame on Carly; still Carly would not consider entering into a real relationship with Holden.
They finally broke things off for good when Holden and Lily decided to try again after Ethan's accident at the Snyder Farm Project. Carly
couldn't understand why no one would forgive her part in the affair.  
After this she became fairly depressed.  She had lost Jack to another woman and couldn't handle it.  She began drinking to help fix her problems.  Her son, Parker, and Craig Montgomery were the only ones that notice her problems.  After a while she agreed to marry Craig, and he was trying to help her with her problem.

Her sister Rosanna came back to town and Carly and Craig lied to her about her alcoholism problem, as they were planning their wedding. After an intervention staged by her family, Carly finally agreed to go to rehab. Then Carly wrote a letter to Sage. She returns from rehab for Brad's funeral and she reveals she has become sober. She is happy to see Craig but then learns that he and Rosanna are having an affair and they break up. Then Craig and Rosanna planned to marry but she leaves him at the altar after realizing he still has feelings for Carly, and she flees to Germany. When Jack and Janet separate, he and Carly grow close once again and when she learns that Janet slept with Dusty she plots to break them up. On September 15, 2010, Jack and Carly re-marry, but while coming home after their wedding, they find Jack's ex-wife, Janet in labor so, Jack and Carly help deliver Janet's child. On September 16, 2010, Carly received news that she was pregnant. By current tense, Carly would have given birth to her child accordingly if the pregnancy was a success.
