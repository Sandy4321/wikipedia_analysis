'''''Hancock''''' is a [[2008]] [[superhero film]] directed by [[Peter Berg]] and starring [[Will Smith]], [[Jason Bateman]], and [[Charlize Theron]]. It tells the story of a vigilante superhero from Los Angeles whose reckless actions routinely cost the city millions of dollars. He saves Ray Embrey from being run over by a train, which causes Embrey, a public relations spokesperson, to make it his mission to change Hancock's public image for the better.

The story was originally written by Vincent Ngo in [[1996]] and [[development hell|had languished in Hollywood for some time]]. The project has had various directors attached, including [[Tony Scott]], [[Michael Mann]], [[Jonathan Mostow]], and [[Gabriele Muccino]]. ''Hancock'' was originally intended to be filmed before ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'', also starring Will Smith. ''Hancock'' was filmed in [[Los Angeles]] with a production budget of $150 million.

In the United States, the film was rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after changes were made at the organization's request in order to avoid a "restricted" (R) rating, which it had received twice before. The film was widely released on [[July 2]] [[2008]] in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Hancock'' has received relatively poor reviews from critics, with a 36% rating from ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', a reviews aggregator website.

==Plot==
John Hancock (Will Smith) is a well-known vigilante who lives in Los Angeles and has powers of a [[superhero]] such as being very strong, invulnerable and being able to fly. He regularly saves lives and catches criminals. However, Hancock's reckless actions routinely cost the city millions of dollars, as Hancock is nearly always drunk while attempting to capture criminals. Hancock, however, does not care what the city thinks, and routinely ignores [[subpoena]]s and talks rudely to strangers.

One day, Hancock saves Ray Embrey ([[Jason Bateman]]), a public-relations spokesperson whose attempts to market his world-changing "All-Heart" charity aren't gaining traction, from being run over by a train (in the process causing a massive [[derailment]] in Hancock's haphazard manner). Ray feels he owes Hancock his life, and he makes it his mission to change Hancock's public image for the better.

Ray teaches Hancock to make the compliment "Good job!" to the police. He also supplies him with a costume, after some other models are rejected by Hancock as being "homo". Ray also persuades Hancock to give himself in and accept going to prison so that the public will realize how much they need him; he argues that in the worst case he can always break out.  He reluctantly agrees and after a month the Chief of Police calls him to help save a female officer who is pinned down in a chaotic bank robbery shootout. After emphatically asking her permission to touch her, explaining that it is not sexual, Hancock saves the officer, removes the gang, and cuts the hand off the gang's leader Kenneth "Red" Parker Jr. ([[Eddie Marsan]]), who is holding a [[dead man's switch]] on a detonator.

After the rescue, Hancock becomes popular once more, as Ray had predicted. Ray and his wife Mary ([[Charlize Theron]]) go out to dinner with Hancock, where he relates how he woke up 80 years earlier with no memories of his life. Later that night, while Ray sleeps after passing out from drinking too much, Hancock discovers that Mary has super powers as well. Mary reveals that they are the last two "gods" or "angels" and have been a couple off and on for 3,000 years. All the others of their kind died - when they get too close to each other they become mortal, which allows them to be injured, and age. These immortals were created in pairs, and are inevitably drawn towards each other; she is Hancock's other half and wife for the last three millenia. She left him after he lost his memory after an attack in order to keep him from becoming mortal.  

Mary and Hancock have a brief fight over revealing this fact to Ray, inadvertently doing just that in the process. Hancock is shot twice in the chest when he stops a liquor store robbery. When he is admitted to the hospital, the news media covers it, thus revealing his location. Shortly before this the news had also revealed Parker had orchestrated a jail break during which eight men escape. Along with two other men, whom Hancock attacked and humiliated during his first day in prison, the revenge-driven villain heads to the hospital. Mary is shot while attempting to protect Hancock. Hancock finishes off the henchmen, but is still severely wounded. Just as he is about to be killed by Parker, Ray grabs a fire axe and chops the killer's other hand off and striking him on the chest with it, thus saving Hancock. Hancock leaves the hospital, Mary is saved and Hancock's powers are fully restored. The film ends with Hancock accepting his role as a hero and living in [[New York City]], letting Ray and Mary live a normal life while remaining their friend. He calls them on the phone one evening as they walk along the [[Santa Monica Pier]] and has them look up to the sky. He has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon as a thanks.  The movie ends with a middle after credit spoiler showing Hancock fighting crime in New York City.

==Production==
===Development===
Screenwriter Vincent Ngo wrote the [[spec script]] ''Tonight, He Comes'' in 1996.  The draft, about a troubled 12-year-old and a fallen superhero, was initially picked up by director [[Tony Scott]] as a potential project.<ref name=artisan>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117869866.html?categoryid=3&cs=1 | title=Artisan 'Comes' to deal with Goldsman | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2002-07-17]] | accessdate=2007-07-08 }}</ref>  Producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] came across the script, which he had considered a favorite,<ref name=plans>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117933792.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Col has plans for 'Tonight' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2005-11-30]] | accessdate=2007-07-08 }}</ref> and encouraged Richard Saperstein, then president of development and production at [[Artisan Entertainment]], to acquire it in 2002.<ref name=artisan/>  Director [[Michael Mann]] was initially attached to direct ''Tonight, He Comes'', but he instead opted to direct ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'' (2006).<ref name=plans/>  Eventually, Artisan placed the project in [[turnaround (film industry term)|turnaround]], and it was acquired by Goldsman.<ref name=hitched>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918115.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Col, Smith get hitched to hero pic | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2005-02-16]] | accessdate=2007-07-08 }}</ref> 

Screenwriters [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[John August]] performed rewrites of Ngo's script,<ref name=clay/> and [[Jonathan Mostow]] was attached to direct the film.  Under Mostow's supervision, a 10-page treatment was written to be pitched to actor [[Will Smith]] to portray the lead role in the film.  Both Mostow and Smith were not yet committed to make the project an active priority at the time.  Several studios pursued the opportunity to finance the film, and [[Columbia Pictures]] succeeded in acquiring the prospect in February 2005.  A second draft was scripted by Gilligan following the finalization of the deal with Columbia.  The film was initially slated for a holiday 2006 release.<ref name=hitched/>

In November 2005, Mostow and Smith committed to ''Tonight, He Comes'', with production slated to begin in [[Los Angeles]] in summer 2006.<ref name=plans/>  Smith had set up a [[pay or play contract]] to film ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' (2007) under [[Warner Bros.]] after completion of ''Tonight, He Comes''.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942073.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2564 | title='Legend' reborn again at Warners | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2006-04-25]] | accessdate=2007-07-08 }}</ref>  Mostow eventually departed from the project due to creative differences.<ref name=ankles>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943453.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 | title='Tonight' helmer ankles | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2006-05-17]] | accessdate=2007-07-08 }}</ref> Italian director [[Gabriele Muccino]] filled Mostow's vacancy in May 2006. Since Muccino was busy editing ''[[The Pursuit of Happyness]]'' starring Smith, which Muccino had directed, Smith switched projects to film ''I Am Legend'' first for its December 2007 release, and then film ''Tonight, He Comes'' afterward.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942537.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Inside Move: 'Legend' of Smith an early tale for WB | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2006-05-03]] | accessdate=2007-07-08 }}</ref>  Later in the month, Muccino left the project because of an incompatibility with filming the story.  Since Muccino was preparing ''The Pursuit of Happyness'', the studio had delayed the production start for ''Tonight, He Comes'' to summer 2007, enabling Warner Bros. to begin production of ''I Am Legend'' with Smith.<ref name=ankles/>

''Hancock'' was Peter Berg's first film with visual effects as critical cinematic elements.<ref name=unheroic/>  He considered the computer-generated fight his least favorite part of the film, citing limited control in making the scene successful.  According to the director, "Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're at the mercy of your effects guys... unless they're really technically oriented, that it's definitely the time we have the least amount of control as directors."  He and other filmmakers worked to cut down on the fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to [[Robert Downey Jr.]]'s acclaimed portrayal of [[Tony Stark]] in the previous May's release, ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]''.<ref name=boozy/>  The director said if ''Hancock'' pulls in as much business as predicted, a sequel, ''Hancock 2'', would likely follow.<ref name=unheroic/>

==Release==
===Marketing===
''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that ''Hancock'''s original story and controversial subject matter present a stark contrast to "a summerful of sequels and animated sure shots" and represent a gamble for "an increasingly corporate entertainment industry". ''Hancock'' had been reviewed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] twice, and both times received an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R rating]] instead of the makers' preferred PG-13 rating to target broader audiences. Questionable elements for the MPAA included Smith's character drinking in front of a 17-year-old and the character flying under the influence of alcohol. One element that was removed from the film to appeal to the MPAA was [[statutory rape]]. With such elements, studio executives only became comfortable with ''Hancock'' when the marketing approach focused on action and humor. Berg noted, "The ad campaign for this movie is much friendlier than the film."<ref name=clay>{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Cieply | title = A Man of Steel With Feet of Clay | work = [[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date = [[2008-05-04]] | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/movies/moviesspecial/04ciep.html?_r=3&ref=movies&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>  The MPAA ultimately gave the film a PG-13 rating, citing "some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and language".<ref name=preview>{{cite news | first=Brian | last=Linder | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/879/879467p1.html | title=Preview: Hancock | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]] | date=[[2008-06-05]] | accessdate=2008-06-24 }}</ref>

''Hancock'' was originally titled ''Tonight, He Comes'' and later changed to ''John Hancock'' before settling on its current title. Marketing consultants attempted to persuade Sony Pictures to again change the title ''Hancock'' because it was too vague for audiences, suggesting alternatives like ''Heroes Never Die'', ''Unlikely Hero'', and ''Less Than Hero''.  Despite the advice, Sony stayed with ''Hancock'' and anticipated marketing on the popularity of the film's star, Will Smith.<ref>{{cite news | first=Josh | last=Friedman | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/admark/la-fi-titles12-2008may12,0,1867330.story | title=Some movies are entitled to do well | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=[[2008-05-12]] | accessdate=2008-05-24 }}</ref>

''Hancock'' had its world premiere as the opener at the 30th [[Moscow International Film Festival]] on [[June 19]] [[2008]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Amie | last=Ferris-Rotman | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSL2063506920080620 | title=Smith and Theron descend on Moscow to promote film | work=[[Reuters]] | publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]] | date=[[2008-06-20]] | accessdate=2008-06-24 }}</ref>  To avoid copyright infringement, organizers undertook "unprecedented" steps to prevent illegal reproduction of the film.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Vladimir | last=Kozlov | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/news/e3i36ba53a2d13a6bd75c11ba21656ab04b | title=Moscow film fest to open with 'Hancock' | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] | date=[[2008-06-05]] | accessdate=2008-06-16 }}</ref>

For the film, Sony created a digital camera package (DCP) having 4K resolution, containing four times more information than the typical DCP that possessed 2K resolution.  Projectors for the higher-resolution package have been installed in 200 theaters in the United States with two dozen in evaluation.  The impact of the package has been debated, with one argument being that the difference is not noticeable and the counter-argument being that the higher resolution has future value.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Carolyn | last=Giardina | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1ede78880f527007a069f58585e40906 | title='Hancock' dressed in 4K | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] | date=[[2008-07-03]] | accessdate=2008-07-03 }}</ref>

Some critics reported that the film was a jumble of ideas that, despite starting well, did not fully deliver the edgy satire the subject matter promised, with a general consensus forming that it suffered from a weak story and poor execution.<ref name="latimes"/><ref name="rt"/> Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that the film's premise was undermined by the execution. McCarthy believed the concept ensured the film was "amusing and plausible" for its first half, but that the second half was full of illogical story developments and missed opportunities.<ref name="mccarthy">{{cite journal | first=Todd | last=McCarthy | url=http://www.variety.com/VE1117937497.html | title=Hancock | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=[[2008-06-24]] | accessdate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> Stephen Farber of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that the opening established the premise well, but that the film came undone when it began to alternate between comedy and tragedy, and introduced a backstory for Hancock that didn't make sense. He said it rewrote its own internal logic in order to pander to its audience.<ref name="farber">{{cite journal | author=Stephen Farber | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=11308 | title=Film Review: Hancock | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] | date=[[2008-06-24]] | accessdate=2008-06-25 }}</ref> Stephen Hunter in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' claimed it had begun with promise, but that the change in tone partway through was so abrupt that the film did not recover.<ref name="post">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/01/AR2008070102882.html | title=Man of Bent Steel | http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/01/AR2008070102882.html | author=Stephen Hunter | work=[[The Washington Post]] | publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] | date=[[2008-07-02]] | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}</ref> Jim Schembri of ''[[The Age]]'' called the change in direction "an absolute killer story twist",<ref name="schembri">{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film-reviews/hancock/2008/07/03/1214950929338.html | title=Hancock review | author=Jim Schembri | work=[[The Age]] | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=[[2008-07-03]] | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}</ref> and David Denby of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said it lifted the film to a new level by supplementing the jokes with sexual tension and emotional power.<ref name="denby">{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/07/07/080707crci_cinema_denby | title=Desperate Men | author=David Denby | work=[[The New Yorker]] | publisher=[[Advance Publications]] | date=[[2008-07-04]] | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}</ref>

Jim Schembri reported that Berg's direction helped to sell Hancock's "well-drawn" backstory,<ref name="schembri"/> Todd McCarthy said the gritty visual approach adopted by Berg did not mesh well with the "vulgar goofiness" of certain scenes,<ref name="mccarthy"/> and Stephen Farber pointed out that Berg's frantic direction compounded the storytelling errors.<ref name="farber"/> Stephen Hunter claimed that Berg had not understood that the shifting tone and plot twists were meant to be humorous, and that he had played straight what was supposed to be a dark comedy and subversive satire.<ref name="post"/> David Denby said Berg's style<U+2014>especially his use of close-ups<U+2014>was intended to showcase "genuine actors at work",<ref name="denby"/> while [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' insisted Berg had taken Hancock to heart and brought gravity to the film.<ref name="dargis">{{cite news | url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/movies/02hanc.html | title=Able to Leap Tall Buildings, Even if Hung Over | author=Manohla Dargis | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=[[2008-07-02]] | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}</ref> 

David Denby described Smith's performance as contrasting with his performances in his other films. He said, "For the first time in his life, Will Smith doesn<U+2019>t flirt with the audience... he stays in character as a self-hating lonely guy."<ref name="denby"/> Stephen Hunter argued that Smith and his co-stars had misunderstood the material in the same manner as Berg. He added that the examination of Smith's character came across at first as an examination of "phenomenally gifted" black sporting superstars who were "marginalized", "dehumanized" and exploited as a product by society.<ref name="post"/> Manohla Dargis was struck by Theron's performance, saying that she enabled Smith to deepen the film's emotional complexity.<ref name="dargis"/> Todd McCarthy said that Smith's "attitude-laden quips" helped to carry the film's superior first half, and that all three leads performed capably, but he said no opportunity was offered for the supporting characters to register.<ref name="mccarthy"/> [[Roger Ebert]] writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' praised the three leads, saying that Smith avoided playing Hancock "as a goofball" and instead portrayed him as a more subtle and serious character.<ref name="ebert">{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080630/REVIEWS/140273658 | title=Hancock review | author=[[Roger Ebert]] | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] | date=[[2008-06-30]] | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}</ref> Stephen Farber said that ''Hancock'' was a good showcase for the leads, affirming that Smith shone in a film that was only sporadically worthy of his performance.<ref name="farber"/>

Jim Schembri concluded that the film was "refreshing, savvy, fun and fast". He said it managed to mix comedy and action successfully, and that the drama came across as surprisingly genuine.<ref name="schembri">{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film-reviews/hancock/2008/07/03/1214950929338.html | title=Hancock review | author=Jim Schembri | work=[[The Age]] | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=[[2008-07-03]] | accessdate=2008-07-04 }}</ref> Stephen Farber believed that the extended development of the film had reduced its quality, but that the visual effects were "stellar" and showed wit.<ref name="farber"/> McCarthy praised the effects, but said the film was "both overwrought and severely undernourished."<ref name="mccarthy"/> Roger Ebert observed the film was "a lot of fun",<ref name="ebert"/> and Manohla Dargis admitted that it was "unexpectedly satisfying". She said that while it faltered and felt rushed towards its end, it had an emotional complexity and "raggedness" that spoke with sincerity about essential human vulnerabilities.<ref name="dargis"/> Stephen Hunter concluded that ''Hancock'' was ultimately "indigestible".<ref name="post"/>
