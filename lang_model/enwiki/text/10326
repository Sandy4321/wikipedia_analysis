'''Andronikos Doukas Palaiologos''' ({{lang-el|<U+1F08><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0394><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03B3><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}; ca. 1083/85 <U+2013> ca. 1115/18) was a [[Byzantine]] aristocrat and governor of [[Thessalonica]] early in the 12th century.

== Life ==
Born in ca. 1083/85, Andronikos was a son of the ''[[sebastos]]'' [[George Palaiologos]] and his wife Anna Doukaina.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=154}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|p=147}} His father was the son of the first known member of the [[Palaiologos]] line, became a distinguished general and was among the most important supporters of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (ruled 1081<U+2013>1118),{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1557}} while his mother was the sister of Alexios' empress-consort, [[Irene Doukaina]].{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|pp=148<U+2013>149}} Andronikos himself was named after his maternal grandfather [[Andronikos Doukas (cousin of Michael VII)|Andronikos Doukas]], which according to Byzantine custom probably suggests that he was the second-born son (his older brother Nikephoros bearing the paternal grandfather's name); Andronikos seems also to have preferred his mother's surname of [[Doukas]], by which he is referred to in the sources.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|p=147}}{{sfn|Polemis|1968|pp=58<U+2013>59, 153<U+2013>154}}

Like his father, he held the court dignity of ''sebastos'', but his early life is obscure. P. Gautier suggested that he is to be identified with the ''[[logothetes ton sekreton]]'' Andronikos Doukas, active under Alexios I, possibly after 1109. The only definitive information about his career is that he served as governor of [[Thessalonica (theme)|Thessalonica]]. The ''[[Timarion]]'', a satirical dialogue placed in the city, alludes to him without naming him, while an act preserved in the [[Docheiariou monastery]] records the "''[[pansebastos sebastos]]'' Andronikos Doukas" serving as "''[[dux|doux]]'' and ''[[praetor]]''" of Thessalonica in January/February 1112.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|pp=147<U+2013>148}}

Andronikos died young of heart failure, predeceasing his parents. His death is placed ca. 1115/18.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=154}}{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|pp=148<U+2013>149}} According to D. Polemis, he was survived by his wife<U+2014>Polemis surmises that this was a daughter of the ''[[porphyrogennete]]'' Zoe Doukaina, youngest daughter of [[Constantine X Doukas]] and wife of [[Adrianos Komnenos]]<U+2014>and was possibly the father of the ''[[megas hetaireiarches]]'' George Palaiologos (who may alternatively have been his brother),{{sfn|Polemis|1968|pp=54<U+2013>55, 154, 155}} but J.-C. Cheynet and J.-F. Vannier believe that he had no offspring.{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|p=149}} The court poet [[Nicholas Kallikles]] wrote an [[epitaph]] and four other poems in his honour,{{sfn|Cheynet|Vannier|1986|pp=147, 149 (note 16)}}{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=154 (note 3)}}  and his parents were later buried in the same tomb following their death.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=154}}
