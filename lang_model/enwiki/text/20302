==History==

===Founding===
[[Image:OldLaf.jpg|left|thumb|Lithograph of Lafayette College, circa 1875.]]
A group of Easton citizens led by James Madison Porter met on December 27, 1824 at White's Tavern to explore the possibility of opening a college.<ref name="Skillman"/>  The recent visit of [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]] to [[New York]] during his [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|grand tour of the US in 1824 and 1825]] prompted the founders to name the school after the [[France|French]] [[military officer]].<ref name="historyoflaf"/>  The group also established the 35-member Board of Trustees, a system of governance that has remained at the college to this day.<ref name="Skillman">Skillman, David B. The Biography of a College Being the History of the First Century of the Life of Lafayette College. Easton, PA: Lafayette College, 1932. Print.</ref>  In need of an education plan, the meeting gave the responsibility to Porter, lawyer Jacob Wagener, and [[Yale]]-educated lawyer Joel Jones.<ref name="Skillman"/>  The charter gained approval and on March 9, 1826, [[Pennsylvania Governor]] [[John Andrew Shulze]]'s signature made the college official.<ref name="Skillman"/> Along with establishing Lafayette as a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|Liberal Arts College]], the charter called for religious equality amongst professors, students, and staff.<ref>http://www.lafayette.edu/about/files/2011/09/October-2011_Statutes.pdf</ref> 

The Board of Trustees met on May 15, 1826 for the election of officers, resulting with Thomas Mckeen as Treasurer, Joel Jones as Secretary, and [[James Madison Porter]] as the first President of the College.<ref name="Skillman"/> Over the next few years, the Board met several times to discuss property and funding for the college's start-up.<ref name="Skillman"/> Six years after the first meeting, Lafayette began to enroll students.<ref name="Skillman"/>

The College opened on May 1, 1829, with four students under the guidance of [[John Monteith (minister)|Rev. John Monteith]].<ref name="Skillman"/> At the start of the next year, the Rev. [[George Junkin]], a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], was elected President of the college and moved the all-male Manual Labor Academy of Pennsylvania from Germantown to Easton.<ref name="Skillman"/> Classes began on May 9, 1832, with the instruction of 43 students on the south bank of the [[Lehigh River]] in a rented farmhouse.<ref name="historyoflaf"/>  In order to earn money to support the program students had to labor in the fields and workshops.<ref name="historyoflaf"/>  This manual labor infused College took the place of the original Military/Civil Engineering focus on which the school was founded, and would remain part of the curriculum until 1839.<ref name="Skillman"/> Later that year, Lafayette purchased property on what is now known as "College Hill" <U+2013> nine acres of elevated land across [[Bushkill Creek]].<ref name="historyoflaf"/>  The College's first building was constructed two years later on the current site of South College.<ref name="historyoflaf"/> [[Image:South College at Lafayette College.jpg|thumb|right|South College is one of Lafayette's largest residence halls, housing approximately 220 students in a coeducational setting.]]

A dispute between Porter and Rev. Junkin led to his resignation of the presidency in 1841.<ref name="Skillman"/> Though still young, Lafayette was beginning to take shape, grappling with the possibility of religious affiliation for financial stability.<ref name="Skillman"/> In 1854, Lafayette College became affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]]. By relinquishing their control, the College was able to collect [[USD|$]]1000 a year from the Presbyterian Church Board of Education as regularly as the latter could pay it.<ref name="Skillman"/> In the time from 1855 to 1856, Lafayette experienced a new peak enrollment of 112 students, leading to the "famous class" of 1857.<ref name="Skillman"/> This close-knit class of 27 men worked in secrecy to establish charters in national fraternities, thus instating the first Greek Fraternities at Lafayette College.<ref name="Skillman"/> These Fraternities remained secret and discouraged by the authorities until 1915.<ref name="Skillman"/>

===World War I===
In preparation for [[World War I]], Lafayette announced that their current students would be awarded their degrees in absentia if they enlisted or went to work for farms to support the war effort.   Professor Beverly Kunkel organized The Lafayette Ambulance United, Section 61, [[United States Army Ambulance Service|United States Army Ambulance Corps]].  During the summer of 1917, Dr. MacCracken arranged to turn the campus into a war camp for the War Department.  Men trained to serve in mechanical trades.  Lafayette remained a war camp until January 2, 1919 when the regular course of study was re-established at Lafayette.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skillman|first=David Bishop|title=The Biography of a College: Lafayette|year=1932|publisher=Scribner Press|location=Hoboken, NJ}}</ref>

===Lafayette in The Depression===
A drastic change in numbers of undergraduate and graduate students occurred between 1930 and 1934 during the [[Great Depression]].  The college made efforts to bolster enrollment including creation of new scholarship opportunities as well as scholarship loans.  Lafayette College also founded an Engineering Guidance Conference for boys.  The Conference was two weeks long and introduced twenty-one high school students to the concepts of engineering.  This program continued until the outbreak of [[World War II]].  Though the College faced its own deficits, it aided the larger community by offering a series of classes to unemployed men free of charge beginning in 1932.  They also made athletic facilities available to unemployed members of the community.  Enrollment began to rise again for the 1935<U+2013>1936 school year.<ref name="Gendebien">{{cite book|last=Gendebien|first=Albert W.|title=The Biography of a College: Begining the History of the Third Half-Century of Lafayette College|year=1986|publisher=Maple Press|location=York, PA}}</ref> [[File:Lafayette College Easton PA 68 building.jpg|thumb|left|Colton Chapel]]

===Decade of Progress campaign===
As the college moved out of the great depression, the college's new President, [[William Mather Lewis]], began what it called the Decade of Progress campaign.  It started as a celebration of the 70th anniversary of Lafayette<U+2019>s engineering program.  President Lewis regarded this 70-year period as a period, which <U+201C>covers the great development in American engineering which has now seemed to reach its peak.<U+201D> The goal of this campaign was to raise $500,000 for payments on Gates hall, renovation of Van Wickle Memorial Library as well as equipment upgrades in other departments.  By the time the campaign closed in 1944, the total amount received was $280,853.34.<ref name="Gendebien"/>

===World War II===
Initially, Lafayette College on the student and faculty level was committed to keeping peace in the [[Western Hemisphere]].  When [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] addressed the [[Pan-American Conference|Pan-American Congress]] stating that it was America<U+2019>s duty to protect American<U+2019>s science, culture, freedom and civilization, thirty-seven Lafayette faculty members wired the President objecting to his sentiments.  When the country was left with no other option in the wake of [[Pearl Harbor]], The College Council of Defense was organized and overseen by the [[Northampton, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] County Council of Defense.  The college took official action as well.  It bolstered its [[ROTC]] program and improved their facilities to prepare for air raid tests.  The college continued to thrive until the draft age was lowered from 20 to 18 in November 1942.  Lafayette College was one of 36 academic institutions selected to train engineering and aviation cadets by the War Department. After the war The [[G.I. Bill|Serviceman<U+2019>s Readjustment Act of 1944]] caused enrollment at Lafayette to jump dramatically peaking in 1949 with approximately 2000 students.<ref name="Gendebien"/>

===Coeducational institution===
In 1967, faculty requested that a special committee be formed to discuss making Lafayette a co-educational institution.  That committee issued a formal recommendation the following year. In September 1970 Lafayette College welcomed its first official coeducational class with 146 women (123 freshmen, and 23 transfers).<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafayette: Coed in 1970|url=http://sites.lafayette.edu/coeducation/|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>

===Recent history===
In 2004, a report on religious life at Lafayette College was compiled.  This report recommended a review of the college's formal relationship with the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian church]].<ref name="chaplainposition">{{cite web | url=http://www.thelaf.com/news/chaplain-position-to-be-eliminated-upon-miller-s-retirement-this-spring-1.2516409#.UTfu-xldW2w | title = Chaplain position to be eliminated upon Miller's retirement this spring | publisher = The Lafayette | accessdate=}}</ref> To date, however, this affiliation remains in place.

In 2007, the college commemorated the 250th birthday of General Lafayette through a series of lectures and campus dedications.<ref name="marquis250">{{cite web | url=http://www.lafayette.edu/250/ | title = Marquis de Lafayette at 250 | publisher = Lafayette College | accessdate=2007-09-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070827032644/http://www.lafayette.edu/250/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-27}}</ref>  Major festivities were held on September 6, 2007, Lafayette's birthday, and were kicked off the night before with a lecture by renowned historian [[David McCullough]]. Lafayette commemorated the recognition of the College Charter by the Pennsylvania Legislature on March 9, with a campus wide and alumni toast around the world.

The school's current president is [[Daniel Weiss (art historian)|Daniel Weiss]].  On January 16, 2013,  [[Alison Byerly|Dr. Alison R. Byerly]] was announced as Lafayette's 17th and first female President.  She took office on July 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafayette College picks Middlebury College professor as its 17th president|url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/easton/index.ssf/2013/01/lafayette_college_picks_middle.html|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref>
