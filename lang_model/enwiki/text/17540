'''KDE''' (''K Desktop Environment'') ({{IPAEng|<U+02CC>ke<U+026A>di<U+02D0><U+02C8>i<U+02D0>}}) is a [[free software]] project which aims to be a powerful system for an easy-to-use [[desktop environment]]. The goal of the project is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology. These include [[KOffice]], [[KDevelop]], [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]], [[K3b]] and many others.

== History ==
===Origins===
KDE was founded in 1996 by [[Matthias Ettrich]], who was then a student at the [[Eberhard Karls University of T<U+00FC>bingen]]. At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the [[Unix]] desktop. Among his qualms was that none of the [[application software|applications]] looked, felt, or worked alike. He proposed the formation of not only a set of applications, but rather a [[desktop environment]], in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop easy to use; one of his complaints with desktop applications of the time was that his girlfriend could not use them.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} His initial [[Usenet]] post spurred a lot of interest, and the KDE project was born.<ref>{{ cite newsgroup | title = New Project: Kool Desktop Environment (KDE) | url = http://groups.google.com/group/de.comp.os.linux.misc/msg/cb4b2d67ffc3ffce | first = Matthias | last = Ettrich |  newsgroup = comp.os.linux.misc | newsgroup = de.comp.os.linux.misc | id = 53tkvv$b4j@newsserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de | date = [[14 October]] [[1996]] | accessdate = 2006-12-29 }}</ref>

The name ''KDE'' was intended as a word play on the existing [[Common Desktop Environment]], available for Unix systems. CDE was an X11-based user environment jointly developed by HP, IBM, and Sun, through the [[X/Open]] Company, with an interface and productivity tools based on the [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] graphical widget toolkit. It was supposed to be an intuitively easy-to-use desktop computer
environment.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://bubl.ac.uk/ARCHIVE/subject/computing/misc/coseup6.htm |title= COSE Update FYI| accessdate= 2007-09-25 }}</ref> The ''K'' was originally suggested to stand for "[[wiktionary:kool|Kool]]", but it was quickly decided that the K should stand for nothing in particular. Additionally, one of the tips in certain versions of KDE 3 incorrectly states that the K currently is just meant to be the letter before L in the Latin alphabet, the first letter in the word Linux (which is where KDE is usually run).<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-bugs-dist&m=99123156103826&w=2 | title = Bug#26414: incorrect tip KDE acronym | accessdate = 2007-08-08 }}</ref>

Matthias Ettrich chose to use the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt toolkit]] for the KDE project. Other programmers quickly started developing KDE/Qt applications, and by early 1997, a few applications were being released. At the time, Qt did not use a [[free software license]] and members of the [[GNU project]] became concerned about the use of such a toolkit for building a free software desktop and applications. Notably, KDE was removed from [[Debian]] because the project interpreted the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] as not allowing KDE to be linked to Qt. Two projects were started: "[[Harmony toolkit|Harmony]]", to create a Free replacement for the Qt libraries, and the [[GNOME]] project to create a new desktop without Qt and built entirely on top of free software.

===First series===
[[Image:KDE 1.0.jpg|thumb|KDE 1.0]]
On [[12 July]] [[1998]] [[KDE 1]].0 was released. In the release announcement the KDE team outlined the project and its reasons for creation:
{{Cquote2|quotetext=KDE is a network transparent, contemporary desktop environment for UNIX workstations. KDE seeks to fill the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar to the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT. We believe that the UNIX operating system is the best operating system available today. In fact UNIX has been the undisputed choice of the information technology professional for many years. When it comes to stability, scalability and openness there is no competition to UNIX. However, the lack of an easy to use contemporary desktop environment for UNIX has prevented UNIX from finding its way onto the desktops of the typical computer user in offices and homes.

With KDE there is now an easy to use, contemporary desktop environment available for UNIX. Together with a free implementation of UNIX such as Linux, UNIX/KDE constitutes a completely free and open computing platform available to anyone free of charge including its source code for anyone to modify. While there will always be room for improvement we believe to have delivered a viable alternative to some of the more commonly found and commercial operating systems/desktops combinations available today. It is our hope that the combination UNIX/KDE will finally bring open, reliable, stable and monopoly free computing to the average computer.

In November 1998, the Qt toolkit was dual-licensed under the free/[[open source license|open source]] [[Q Public License]] (QPL) & commercial-licence (proprietary software is required to pay a licence fee to Trolltech) The same year, the KDE Free Qt foundation<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php | title = KDE Free Qt Foundation | accessdate = 2007-01-26 }}</ref> was created which guarantees that Qt would fall under a variant of the very liberal [[BSD license]] should Trolltech cease to exist or no free/[[open source software|open source]] version of Qt be released during 12 months. Debate continued about compatibility with the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), so in September 2000, [[Trolltech]] made the Unix version of the Qt libraries available under the GPL, in addition to the QPL, which eliminated the concerns of the [[Free Software Foundation]].

===Second and third series===
[[Image:KDE-2.0-es-es.png|thumb|KDE 2.0]]
The second series of releases, [[KDE 2]], introduced significant technological improvements.<ref name="2.0 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-2.0.php KDE 2.0 Release Announcement]</ref> These included [[DCOP]] (Desktop COmmunication Protocol), [[KIO]], an application I/O library. [[KParts]], a [[component object model]], allowing an application to embed another within itself, and [[KHTML]], an [[HTML]] rendering and drawing engine.<ref name="2.0 announcement"/>

[[Image:Kde-3.2.3-es-es.png|thumb|KDE 3.2 with Konqueror and the About screen.]]
The [[KDE 3|third series]] was much larger than the previous series, consisting of six major releases. The API changes between KDE&nbsp;2 and KDE&nbsp;3 were comparatively minor, meaning that the KDE 3 can be seen as largely a continuation of the KDE 2 series. All releases of KDE&nbsp;3 are built upon Qt&nbsp;3, which was only released under the GPL for Linux and Unix-like operating systems, including Mac OS X. For that reason, KDE&nbsp;3 is only available on Windows through ports involving an X server.

===Fourth series===
[[Image:KDE 4.0.png|thumb|KDE 4.0 with Dolphin and System Settings.]]
[[KDE 4]] is based on Qt&nbsp;4 which is also released under the GPL for Windows and Mac OS X. Therefore KDE&nbsp;4 applications can be compiled and run natively on these operating systems as well.

KDE 4 includes many new technologies and technical changes. The centerpiece is a redesigned desktop and panels collectively called [[Plasma (KDE)|Plasma]] which replaces [[Kicker (KDE)|Kicker]], [[KDesktop]], and [[SuperKaramba]] by integrating their functionality into one piece of technology, and is intended to be more configurable for those wanting to update the decades-old [[desktop metaphor]]. There are a number of new frameworks, including [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]], a new multimedia interface making KDE independent of any one specific media backend, [[Solid (KDE)|Solid]], an API for network and portable devices, and [[Decibel (KDE)|Decibel]], a new communication framework to integrate all communication protocols into the desktop. Also featured is a metadata and search framework, incorporating [[Strigi]] as a full-text file indexing service, and [[NEPOMUK (framework)|NEPOMUK]] with KDE integration.<ref>[http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main1/Nepomuk-Kde NEPOMUK-KDE]</ref>

The release of KDE 4.0 has met with mixed reception, however. While early adopters have been tolerant of lack of finish for some of its new features, KDE 4.0 has taken the brunt of the wave of criticism for its release in popular linux distributions, despite the lack of stability and the somewhat developer quality as compared with former release, KDE 3. The reason is that KDE 4.0's aforementioned developments are still works in progress. The criticism has emerged in spite of the environment being labelled as non-final in distributions such as OpenSUSE. On the other hand favourable reviews praised KDE 4.0 for its revolutionary changes. <!---By the time KDE 4.1 is released, the environment will gain more polish and become more stable, making it more sufficient for release unto the general public.--->

== Organization==
Like many free/open source software projects, KDE is primarily a volunteer effort, although various companies, such as [[Novell]] (in the form of [[SuSE]]), [[Trolltech]], and [[Mandriva]], employ developers to work on the project. Since a large number of individuals contribute to KDE in various ways (''e.g.'' code, translation, artwork), organization of such a project is complex. Most problems are discussed on a number of different [[mailing list]]s. Important decisions, such as release dates and inclusion of new [[application software|applications]], are made on the ''kde-core-devel'' list by the so-called ''core developers''. These are developers who have made significant contributions to KDE over a long period of time. Decisions are not made by a formal voting process, but by discussion on the mailing lists. In most cases this seems to work well, and major debates (such as the question of whether the KDE&nbsp;2 [[application programming interface|API]] should be broken in favour of KDE&nbsp;3) are rare.

The KDE project and related events are frequently [[sponsor]]ed by individuals, universities, and businesses.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kde.org/support/thanks.php | title=Sponsorship Thanks | accessdate=2006-10-16}}</ref> On [[15 October]] [[2006]], it was announced that [[Mark Shuttleworth]] had become the first [[patron]] of KDE, the highest level of [[sponsorship]] available.<ref name="kdepatron">{{cite web|url=http://dot.kde.org/1160932072/|title=Mark Shuttleworth Becomes the First Patron of KDE|date=[[15 October]] [[2006]]|publisher=KDE|accessdate=2006-10-16}}</ref> On [[2007]]-[[07-07]], it was announced that [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Novell]] had also become patrons of KDE.<ref name="kdepatron-intevell">{{cite web|url=http://dot.kde.org/1183806862/|title=Intel and Novell Become Patrons of KDE|date=[[July 7]] [[2007]]|publisher=KDE|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

While developers and users are now located all over the world, the project retains a strong base in [[Germany]]. The web servers are located at the universities of [[T<U+00FC>bingen]] and [[Kaiserslautern]], a German non-profit organization (KDE e.V.) owns the [[trademark]] on "KDE" and KDE conferences often take place in Germany.

=== Identity ===
[[Image:Konqi-klogo-official-400x500 b.png|right|100px|thumb|[[Konqi]], mascot of the KDE project]]
Many KDE applications have a "K" in the name, mostly as an initial letter and capitalized. However, there are notable exceptions like [[Synaptic Package Manager#kynaptic|kynaptic]], whose ''K'' is not capitalized, and [[Amarok (audio)|Amarok]]. The ''K'' in many KDE applications is obtained by spelling a word which originally begins with ''C'' or ''Q'' differently, for example [[Konsole]] (which, incidentally, is correct spelling in German) and [[Kuickshow]]. Also, some just prefix a commonly used word with a ''K'', for instance [[KOffice]]. Some applications do not have a ''K'' in the name at all, such as [[Gwenview]]. This seems to be an increasing trend among KDE 4 applications and technologies.

The KDE project's [[mascot]] is a green dragon named [[Konqi]].

==Development==
KDE is built with Nokia [[Trolltech]]'s [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] toolkit which runs on most [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Both KDE and GNOME now participate in [[freedesktop.org]], an effort to standardize Unix desktop interoperability, although there is still some competition between them.<ref>[http://www.pcauthority.com.au/feature.aspx?CIaFID=3446 A tale of two desktops]</ref>

The KDE team releases new versions on a regular basis.

==== Platform releases ====
Platform releases are major releases that begin a series (version number X.0). These releases are allowed to break both binary and [[source-compatibility]] with the predecessor, or to put it differently, all following releases (X.1, X.2, ...) will guarantee source & binary compatibility ([[Application programming interface|API]] & [[Application binary interface|ABI]]). This means, for instance, that software that was developed for KDE&nbsp;3.0 will work on all (future) KDE&nbsp;3 releases, in contrast to an application that was developed for KDE&nbsp;2, which is not guaranteed to be able to make use of the KDE&nbsp;3 libraries. KDE major version numbers follow the Qt release cycle meaning that KDE&nbsp;4 is based on Qt&nbsp;4, while KDE&nbsp;3 was based on Qt&nbsp;3.

==== Standard releases ====
There are two main types of releases, major releases and maintenance releases.

Major releases (with two version numbers, for example 3.5) contain new features. As soon as a major release is ready and announced, work on the next major release starts. A major release needs several months to be finished and many bugs that are fixed during this time are [[backport]]ed to the stable branch, meaning that these fixes are incorporated into the last stable release by maintenance releases.  Starting with the KDE 4 series, KDE has a major release roughly every six months.

[[Maintenance release]]s have three version numbers, e.g. KDE 1.1.1, and focus on fixing bugs, minor glitches and making small usability improvements. Maintenance releases in general do not allow new features although some releases include small enhancements. A shortened release schedule is used.  Starting with the KDE 4 series, KDE has a maintenance release roughly every month, except when there is a major release.

== Toolkit licensing ==
[[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]], to which native graphical KDE applications link for their graphical [[Widget toolkit|widgets]], is free software, [[dual-licensed]] under the [[GNU GPL]] versions 2 and 3, and [[QPL]] licenses. Trolltech also sell licenses for developing [[proprietary software]]. When using the free versions, programs which link to Qt must be released as [[free software]] (under the GPL or another license permitted by the QPL, such as the BSD or LGPL for example).  The core libraries of KDE are collectively licensed under the [[GNU LGPL]], although unless the license of Qt is changed (for example, if the agreement made with the KDE Free Qt foundation is invoked) the only way for commercial software to make use of them is to be developed under the terms of the Qt commercial license.

It is not necessary to use Qt or the KDE libraries to write software which integrates well with the KDE desktop. Software using any other toolkit, following the [[freedesktop.org]] standards or using KDE facilities such as KPrinter and KDialog can integrate nicely with the KDE desktop (both KPrinter and KDialog link to Qt, and are under the GPL), however the widgets will not have the exact behavior of Qt widgets. Additional integration efforts are being discussed in the [[Portland Project|Portland Free Desktop initiative]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Portland | title=A portland Wiki - Portland | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> and are planned for KDE 4.

Some other free/open source desktop platforms (such as [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]] and [[EDE]]) use [[Widget toolkit|toolkits]] licensed under the [[LGPL]]. The LGPL permits proprietary/closed source applications to link to libraries licensed under the LGPL, with some restrictions: the Section 6 of the LGPL v2.1 prohibits linking to software with a license that restricts reverse-engineering and modification of the work for the customer's own use.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html | title=GNU Lesser General Public License | accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> The [[proprietary software license|proprietary]] Qt license which Trolltech sells does not carry these restrictions.
