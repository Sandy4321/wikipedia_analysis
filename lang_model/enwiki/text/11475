[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB|PC}} (30 September 1788 &ndash; 29 June 1855), known before 1852 as '''Lord FitzRoy Somerset''', was a [[British Army]] officer. As a junior officer he served in the [[Peninsular War]] and the [[Hundred Days]], latterly as military secretary to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. He also took part in politics as  [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Truro (Parliamentary borough)|Truro]] before becoming [[Master-General of the Ordnance]]. He became commander of the British troops sent to the [[Crimea]] in 1854: while his primary objective was to defend [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] he was ordered to besiege the [[Russia]]n Port of [[Sevastopol]]. After an early success at the [[Battle of Alma]], a failure to deliver orders with sufficient clarity caused the fateful [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. Despite further success at the [[Battle of Inkerman]], a piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol in June 1855 was a complete failure. Somerset died later that month from a mixture of [[dysentery]] and [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].

[[File:Raglan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Field Marshal Fitzroy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, 1855]]
Somerset became commander of the British troops sent to the [[Crimea]] with the temporary rank of full [[general]] on 21 February 1854<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21524|startpage=515|date=21 February 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> and was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 20 June 1854.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21564|startpage=1931|date=22 June 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> While Somerset's primary objective was to defend [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] he was ordered by the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], who was at the time [[Secretary of State for War]], to besiege the [[Russia]]n Port of [[Sevastopol]] "unless it could not be undertaken with a reasonable prospect of success".<ref>Hibbert, p. 56</ref> An Anglo-French force under the joint command of Somerset and [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud|General Jacques St. Arnaud]] defeated General [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]]'s Russian army at the [[Battle of Alma]] in September 1854.<ref name=heath268/>

At the [[Battle of Balaclava]] in October 1854, Somerset issued an order to the [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan|Earl of Lucan]], his cavalry commander, who in turn ordered the [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan|Earl of Cardigan]], a subordinate commander who happened to be Lucan's brother-in-law and who detested him, to lead the fateful [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] leading to some 278 British casualties.<ref>Calthorpe, p. 132</ref> Despite an indecisive result at Balaclava the British and French allied army gained a victory at the [[Battle of Inkerman]] in November 1854 and Somerset was promoted to the rank of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 5 November 1854.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21630|startpage=3593|date=21 November 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> He was also awarded the Ottoman Empire [[Order of the Medjidie]], 1st Class on 15 May 1855.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21714|startpage=1915|date=18 May 1855|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref>

Somerset was blamed by the press and the government for the sufferings of the British soldiers in the terrible Crimean winter during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854<U+2013>55)|Siege of Sevastopol]] owing to shortages of food and clothing<ref>Martin, p. 181</ref> although this, in part, was the fault of the home authorities who failed to provide adequate logistical support.<ref name=odnb/> A piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol on 18 June 1855 was a complete failure.<ref name=odnb/> The anxieties of the siege began to seriously undermine Somerset's health and he died from a mixture of [[dysentery]] and [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] on 29 June 1855.<ref name=odnb/> His body was brought home and interred at [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton]].<ref name=heath268/>
