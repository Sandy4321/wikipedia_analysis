The '''Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction event''' was the large-scale [[mass extinction]] of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time, approximately {{Ma|65.5}} (mya). It is widely known as the '''K<U+2013>T extinction event''' and is associated with a geological signature, usually a thin band dated to that time and found in various parts of the world, known as the [[K<U+2013>T boundary]]. ''K'' is the traditional abbreviation for the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], and ''T'' is the abbreviation for the [[Tertiary]] Period.  The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.<ref name="Fortey">{{cite book|author=Fortey, R|title=Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth|publisher=Vintage|date=1999|pages=238<U+2013>260|isbn=978-0375702617}}</ref>

Many scientists theorize that the K-T extinctions were caused by one or more catastrophic geological events such as massive [[impact event|asteroid impacts]] or increased [[volcano|volcanic activity]].  Several [[impact craters]] and massive volcanic activity in the [[Deccan traps]] have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event. These geological events may have reduced [[sunlight]] and hindered [[photosynthesis]], leading to a massive disruption in Earth's [[ecology]].  Other researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in [[sea level]] or [[climate]].<ref name="MacLeod"/>

==Extinction patterns==
There was a progressive decline in [[biodiversity]] during the Maastrichtian stage of the Cretaceous Period prior to the suggested [[ecological crisis]] induced by events at the K-T boundary. Furthermore, biodiversity required a substantial amount of time to recover from the K-T event, despite the probable existence of an abundancy of vacant [[ecological niche]]s.<ref name="MacLeod"/>

Despite the severity of this boundary event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different [[clades]].  Species which depended on [[photosynthesis]] became extinct or suffered heavy losses due to reduced [[solar energy]] reaching the earth's surface due to atmospheric particles blocking the sunlight.  As is the case today, photosynthesizing organisms, such as [[phytoplankton]] and land [[plant]]s, formed the primary part of the [[food chain]] in the late Cretaceous.  Evidence suggests that [[Herbivores|herbivorous]] animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, top [[predators]] such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also perished.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilf, P & Johnson KR|title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: a quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record|journal=Paleobiology|date=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=347<U+2013>368|doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030%3C0347:LPEATE%3E2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

[[Coccolithophorids]] and [[mollusc]]s, including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, freshwater [[snail]]s and [[mussel]]s, as well as organisms whose [[food chain]] included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of [[mosasaur]]s, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary.<ref name="Kauffman">{{cite journal| last =Kauffman| first =E| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Mosasaur Predation on Upper Cretaceous Nautiloids and Ammonites from the United States Pacific Coast | journal =Palaios| volume =19| issue =1| pages =96<U+2013>100| publisher =Society for Sedimentary Geology| date =2004| url=http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/96|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

[[Omnivores]], [[insectivores]] and [[carrion]]-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[mammal]]s. Mammals and birds which survived the extinction fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter.

The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, [[crocodilian]]s and [[Choristodera|champsosaur]]s, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name="SheehanHansen"/>

===Microbiota===

The K<U+2013>T boundary represents one of the most dramatic turnovers in the [[fossil record]] for various [[calcareous]] [[nanoplankton]] (which formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name).

[[Radiolaria]] have left a geological record since at least the [[Ordovician]] times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K-T boundary.

As the [[biomass]] in the ocean is thought to have decreased during the hypothesised K-T event, numerous species of [[benthic]] foraminifera went extinct, presumably since they depend on organic debris for nutrients.  However, as the marine microbiota recovered, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources.<ref name="MacLeod"/>  Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding.

===Marine invertebrates===
[[Image:Amonites.Domus da Coru<U+00F1>a.jpg|thumb|left|An [[ammonite]] fossil]]

There is variability in the fossil record as to the extinction rate of marine invertebrates across the K-T boundary.  The apparent rate is influenced by the lack of fossil records rather than actual extinction.<ref name="MacLeod"/>

[[Ostracodes]], a class of small [[crustaceans]] that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits in a variety of locations.  A review of these fossils shows that ostracode diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any other time in the Tertiary.  However, current research cannot ascertain whether the extinctions occurred prior to or during the boundary interval itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Coles GP, Ayress MA, and Whatley RC|date=1990|title=A comparison of North Atlantic and 20 Pacific deep-sea Ostracoda in Ostracoda and global events (RC Whatley and C Maybury, editors)|pages=287<U+2013>305|publisher=Chapman & Hall|isbn=978-0442311674}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Late Maastrichtian and Danian Ostracode Faunas from Northern Alaska: Reconstructions of Environment and Paleogeography|author=Brouwers EM & De Deckker P|date=1993|journal=Palaios|volume=8|issue=2|pages=140<U+2013>154|doi=10.2307/3515168}}</ref>

Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous [[Scleractinia]] [[coral]] genera failed to cross the K-T boundary into the Paleocene.  Further analysis of the coral extinctions show that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow [[tropical]] waters, went extinct.  The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and areas of the ocean below the [[photic zone]] were less impacted by the K-T boundary.  Colonial coral species rely upon [[symbiosis]] with photosynthetic [[algae]], which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K-T boundary.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vescsei, A & Moussavian, E|title=Paleocene reefs on the Maiella Platform Margin, Italy: An example of the effects of the cretaceous/tertiary boundary events on reefs and carbonate platforms|date=1997|journal=Facies|volume=36|issue=1|pages=123<U+2013>139|doi=10.1007/BF02536880}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Rosen, BR & Turnsek, D|date=1989|title=Extinction patterns and biogeography of scleractinian corals across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary.

Most species of [[brachiopods]], a small phylum of nearly extinct marine invertebrates, survived the K-T event and diversified during the early Paleocene. The numbers of cephalopod, [[echinoderm]], [[bivalve]], and [[brachiopod]] genera exhibited significant diminution after the K-T boundary.<ref name="MacLeod"/>

Except for [[nautiloid]]s (represented by the modern [[order]] of [[nautilida]]) and [[Coleoidea]]s (which diverged into modern [[octopus]] and [[squids]]) all other species of the class [[Cephalopoda]] went extinct at the K-T boundary. [[Ammonite|Ammonoids]], a group of shelled cephalopods whose fossils are widely distributed, went extinct at the K-T boundary, as did other clades of the class. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving orders, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in surviving the extinction event.  The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (multiple eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K-T boundary event.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ward, PD, Kennedy, WJ, MacLeod, KG, and Mount, JF|date=1991|title=Ammonite and inoceramid bivalve extinction patterns in Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sections of the Biscay region (southwestern France, northern Spain)|journal=Geology|volume=19|issue=12|pages=1181<U+2013>1184|url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/12/1181}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Harries PJ, Johnson KR, Cobban WA, Nichols DJ|date=2002|title=Marine Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section in southwestern South Dakota: Comment and Reply|journal=Geology|volume=30|issue=10|pages=954<U+2013>955}}</ref>

Approximately 35% of [[echinoderm]] genera went extinct at the K-T boundary, although taxa that thrived in low-latitude, shallow-water environments during late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate.  Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K-T boundary.  The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of [[carbonate platform]]s, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Neraudeau D, Thierry J & Moreau P|date=1997|title=Variation in echinoid biodiversity during the Cenomanian<U+2013>early Turonian transgressive episode in Charentes (France)|journal=Bulletin de la Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> g<U+00E9>ologique de France|volume=168|pages=51<U+2013>61}}</ref>

[[Insect]] damage to the fossilized leaves of [[flowering plants]] from  fourteen sites in North America were used as a proxy for insect diversity across the K<U+2013>T boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction.  Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity.

Due to the wholesale destruction of vegetation at the K<U+2013>T boundary, there was a significant proliferation of [[saprophytic]] organisms such as [[Fungus|fungi]] which do not require [[photosynthesis]] and need organic substrates provided by the dead vegetation.  The dominance of fungal species would have lasted only a few years until ferns and other plant species recovered when the atmosphere cleared and once again favored photosynthetic organisms.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vajda, V & McLoughlin S|date=2004|title=Fungal Proliferation at the Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary Boundary|journal=Science|url=http://www.geol.lu.se/personal/VIV/Vajda%20&McLoughlin%202004.pdf|format=PDF |volume=303|pages=1489<U+2013>1490|doi=10.1126/science.1093807|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

===Amphibians===

There is no evidence of K<U+2013>T boundary mass extinctions of amphibians, and there is strong evidence that most amphibians survived the event relatively unscathed.<ref name="MacLeod"/>  Several in-depth studies of [[salamander]] genera in fossil beds in [[Montana]] show that six of seven genera were unchanged after the event.<ref name="Archibald">{{cite journal|author=Archibald, JD & Bryant, LJ|date=1990|title=Differential Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction of nonmarine vertebrates; evidence from northeastern Montana.

[[Frog]] species appear to have survived into the [[Paleocene]] with few species becoming extinct.

Amphibian survival resulted from the clade's ability to seek shelter in water or to build burrows in sediments, soil, wood, or beneath rocks.<ref name="Robertson"/>

===Non-archosaur reptiles===

The two living non-[[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]] taxa, [[testudines]] (turtles) and [[lepidosaur]]s ([[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[Amphisbaenia|worm lizards]]), along with [[champsosaur]]s (semi-aquatic [[archosauromorph]]s which died out in the early [[Miocene]]), survived through the K<U+2013>T boundary.<ref name="MacLeod"/>  Over 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K-T boundary.  Additionally, all six turtle families in existence at the end of the Cretaceous survived into the Tertiary are represented by current species.<ref name="Novacek">{{cite journal|title=100 Million Years of Land Vertebrate Evolution: The Cretaceous-Early Tertiary Transition |author=Novacek MJ|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|volume=86|issue=2|date=199|pages=230<U+2013>258|doi=10.2307/2666178}}</ref>

Living lepidosaurs include [[Rhynchocephalia]] and [[Squamata]]. The Rhynchocephalia, or tuatara, were widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurs in the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous. They are represented today by a single genus located exclusively in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lutz D|date=2005|title = Tuatara: A Living Fossil|publisher=DIMI Press|isbn=0-931625-43-2}}</ref>

The order, Squamata, which is represented today by lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenia, radiated into various ecological niches during the [[Jurassic]] and were successful throughout the Cretaceous.  They survived through the K-T boundary and are currently the most successful and diverse group of living reptiles with more than 6000 extant species.  All living families of lizards represent survivors from the Cretaceous, so it is presumed that few went extinct at the boundary.  No known family of terrestrial squamates went extinct at the boundary, and based on fossil evidence, they did not suffer any significant decline in numbers.  Their small size, adaptable metabolism and ability to move to more favorable habitats were key factors to their survivability during the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.<ref name="Novacek"/><ref name="MacLeod"/>

===Archosaurs===

The [[archosaur]] clade includes two living orders, [[crocodilians]] (of which [[Alligatoridae]], [[Crocodylidae]] and [[Gavialidae]] are the only surviving families) and [[birds]], along with the extinct [[dinosaurs]] and [[pterosaurs]].

====Crocodilians====

Ten crocodile families are represented in the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K-T boundary.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Calibration age and quartet divergence date estimation|author=Brochu CA|date=2004|journal=Evolution|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1375<U+2013>1382|doi=10.1554/03-509}}</ref>  Five families have both Maastrichtian and Paleocene fossil representatives.  All of the surviving families of crocodilians freshwater and terrestrial environments, except for the [[Dyrosauridae]] which lived in freshwater and marine locations. Approximately 50% of crocodilian representatives survived across the K-T boundary, with the only apparent trend is that no large crocodiles, such as the giant North American crocodile ''[[Deinosuchus]]'', survived.<ref name="MacLeod"/>  Crocodilian survivability across the boundary resulted from its aquatic niche and ability to burrow which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary.<ref name="Robertson">{{cite journal|title= Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic|author=Robertson DS, McKenna MC, Toon OB, Hope S & Lillegraven JA|journal=GSA Bulletin|date=2004|volume=116|issue=5<U+2013>6|pages=760<U+2013>768|doi=10.1130/B25402.1|url=http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~presto/cenozoic.pdf|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>

====Pterosaurs====

Only one family of pterosaurs, [[Azhdarchidae]], is definitely present in the Maastrichtian, and it went extinct at the K-T boundary.  These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a group that contained 10 families during the mid-Cretaceous.  Smaller pterosaurs went extinct prior to the Maastrichtian as a result of competition with birds that filled the same ecological niche and as a result of their non-sheltering environment niche.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Slack KE, Jones CM, Ando T, Harrison GL, Fordyce RE, Arnason U &  Penny D|date=2006|title=Early Penguin Fossils, Plus Mitochondrial Genomes, Calibrate Avian Evolution|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=23|pages=1144<U+2013>1155|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/6/1144|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref><ref name="PennyPhillips">{{cite journal|author=Penny D & Phillips MJ|date=2004|title=The rise of birds and mammals: are microevolutionary processes sufficient for macroevolution|journal=Trends Ecol.

====Birds====
[[Image:Amnh30.jpg|thumb|The remarkable four-winged ''[[Microraptor]]'', a distant relative of the birds.]]
Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see [[Origin of birds]]).  However, all non-[[Neornithes|neornithean]] birds became extinct, including flourishing groups like [[Enantiornithes|enantiornithines]] and [[Hesperornithes|hesperornithiforms]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hou L, Martin M, Zhou Z & Feduccia A|date=1996|title=Early Adaptive Radiation of Birds: Evidence from Fossils from Northeastern China|journal=Science|volume=274|issue=5290|pages=1164<U+2013>1167|doi=10.1126/science.274.5290.1164}}</ref>  Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K-T boundary, and that duck, chicken and ratite bird relatives existed with non-avian dinosaurs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Definitive fossil evidence for the extant avian radiation in the Cretaceous|author=Clarke JA, Tambussi CP, Noriega JI, Erickson GM, & Ketcham RA|date=2005|journal=Nature|volume=433|issue=7023|pages=305<U+2013>308|doi=10.1038/nature03150}}</ref>  Neornithine birds survived the K-T boundary as a result of their abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water, marshlands.  Many species of birds can build burrows, nest in tree holes, or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K-T boundary.  Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of dinosaurs.<ref name="Robertson"/>

====Dinosaurs====
[[Image:Sauriersenck.JPG|thumb|''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' replica at [[Senckenberg Museum]], showing modern view of posture.]]
More has been published about the extinction of dinosaurs at the K-T boundary than any other group of organisms.  Except for a few controversial claims, all non-avian dinosaurs went extinct at the K-T boundary.  The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the choices.<ref name=AF04>{{cite book |last=Archibald |first=J.

It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food as both herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce, and carnivores would have shortly found prey in short supply.<ref name="Robertson"/>

Several researchers have stated that there were [[Paleocene dinosaurs]] and therefore the extinction of dinosaurs was gradual. Their arguments were based on the discovery of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek]] Formation up to {{m to ft|1.3}} above and 40,000 years later than the K<U+2013>T boundary.<ref name="Sloan"/>  In 2001, it was argued by Fassett and colleagues that pollen samples recovered near a fossilized [[hadrosaur]] [[femur]] recovered in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone at the [[San Juan River (Utah)|San Juan River]] indicate that the animal lived in Tertiary times, approximately 64.5&nbsp;mya (about 1 million years after the K<U+2013>T event).  This would make hadrosaurids a [[Dead Clade Walking]].<ref name="Fassett"/>  Others, including Sullivan, have stated that these apparent "Paleocene dinosaurs" are "re-worked", that is, the fossils were eroded from their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.<ref name ="Sullivan"/>

===Mammals===

The Northern hemisphere [[marsupial]] families became extinct, but those in Australia and South America survived. Other mammalian families, including [[monotremes]] (egg-laying mammals), [[multituberculates]], and [[placentals]], the ancestors of most modern mammals, survived the K<U+2013>T event.<ref name="Dodson">{{cite book| last = Dodson| first = P.| authorlink =Peter Dodson | title = The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History| publisher = Princeton University Press| date = 1996| location = Princeton| pages = 279<U+2013>281| isbn = 0-691-05900-4}}</ref>  Mammalian species began diversifying approximately 30 million years prior to the K-T boundary; however, further diversification actually stalled across the boundary, which indicates that mammals filled ecological niches during the Cretaceous that were least impacted by the extinction event.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The delayed rise of present-day mammals|author=Bininda-Emonds, ORP, Cardillo, M, Jones, KE, MacPhee, RDE, Beck, RMD, Grenyer, R, Price, SA, Vos, RA, Gittleman, JL Y Purvis, A|journal=Nature|volume=446|pages=507<U+2013>512|date=2007|doi=10.1038/nature05634}}</ref>  A few orders of mammals did diversify right at the K-T boundary, including [[Chiroptera]] (bats) and [[Cetartiodactyla]] ([[cetaceans|whales and dolphins]] and [[Even-toed ungulate]]s), as a result of the reduced competition in those niches.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Placental mammal diversification and the Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary boundary|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/100/3/1056.pdf|format=PDF|date=2003|author=Springer, MS, Murphy, WJ, Eizirik, E, & O'Brien, SJ|journal=PNAS|volume=100|issue=3|pages=1056<U+2013>1061|doi=10.1073/pnas.0334222100|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref>

K-T boundary mammalian species were relatively small (most less than 1 kg) which allowed them to find shelter in a number of different environments.  In addition, many early monotremes and marsupials were semiaquatic or burrowing which also provided protection from K-T boundary environmental stresses.<ref name="Robertson"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gelfo JN & Pascual R|date=2001|title=''Peligrotherium tropicalis'' (Mammalia, Dryolestida) from the early Paleocene of Patagonia, a survival from a Mesozoic Gondwanan radiation|journal=Geodiversitas|volume=23|pages=369<U+2013>379}}</ref>

==Evidence==
===North American fossils===
[[Image:Field dinos 2.jpg|thumb|right|A rich variety of [[dinosaur]] fossils are found in stratigraphic layers that predate the event.]]

In North American terrestrial sequences, the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-Maastrichtian palynomorph record and the post-boundary fern spike.<ref name="Vajdaetal"/> 

At present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks is found in [[Montana]], USA, comprised of the [[Hell Creek]], [[Lance Formation|Lance]] and [[Scollard Formation|Scollard]] formations.  The fossil beds are found in strata from about 83.5&nbsp;mya (million years ago) to 64.9&nbsp;mya, covering the [[Campanian]] and [[Maastrichtian]] [[geologic timescale|ages]] of the [[Cretaceous]] through the beginning of the [[Paleocene]] period. They show changes in dinosaur populations over the last 18 million years of the Cretaceous. Although the Hell Creek, Lance and Scollard formations provide a wealth of information, they cover a relatively small area and it cannot be assumed that these formations represent a worldwide picture of dinosaur life at the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name="MacLeod"/>

The middle<U+2013>late Campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Torosaurus]]'',<ref name="Dodson"/> which suggests prey were plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.

In addition to rich dinosaur fossils, there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K-T boundary.  In the sediments below the K<U+2013>T boundary the dominant plant remains are [[angiosperm]] pollen grains, but the actual boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores.<ref name="USGS">{{cite web| title =Online guide to the continental Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary boundary in the Raton basin, Colorado and New Mexico| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey| date =2004| url =http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/kt/stop2b.html| doi =| accessdate =2007-07-08}}</ref> Normal pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smathers, GA & Mueller-Dombois, D|date=1974|title=Invasion and Recovery of Vegetation after a Volcanic Eruption in Hawai'i, Scientific Monograph Number 5|publisher=United States National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/science/5/contents.htm|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

===Marine fossils===

The mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at the K<U+2013>T boundary.<ref name="Pope">{{cite journal|author=Pope, KO, D'Hondt, SL & Marshall, CR|date=1998|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/19/11028|accessdate=2007-06-15|title=Meteorite impact and the mass extinction of species at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary|journal=PNAS|volume=95|issue=19|pages=11028<U+2013>11029|id=PMID 9736679}}</ref> [[Ammonite]] genera became extinct at or near the K<U+2013>T boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression.

R. & Ward, PD|date=1996|title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys|journal=Science|volume=274|issue=5291|pages=1360<U+2013>1363|doi=10.1126/science.274.5291.1360}}</ref> Further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in the late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction.<ref name="Marshall"/>

==Duration==
The length of time taken for the extinction to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over a relatively short period (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the [[Signor-Lipps effect]]; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Signor III, P. W. and Lipps, J. H.|date=1982|title=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns, and catastrophes in the fossil record.  In: Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the Earth, Silver, LT & Schultz, PH (editors)|journal=Geological Society of America Special Publication|volume=190|pages=291<U+2013>296}}</ref>  Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock which cover a time range from several million years before the K<U+2013>T extinction to a few million years after it.<ref name="MacLeod"/>

==Geological cause of extinctions==

There have been several theories on cause of the K-T boundary which lead to the massive extinction.  These theories have centered on either impact events or increased vulcanism; some include elements of both.   A scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, [[marine regression]], and extraterrestrial impact has been proposed. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in and loss of habitats. Dinosaurs, as the largest vertebrates, were the first to be effected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, [[particulate]] materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains.  The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction.<ref name="AF04"/>

[[Image:Chicxulub radar topography.jpg|thumb|Radar topography reveals the {{km to mi|180}} wide ring of the crater.]]

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of [[Nobel prize]]-winning physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], his son geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michels discovered that [[sedimentary]] layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary boundary contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] many times greater than normal (30 times and 130 times background in the two sections originally studied).  Iridium is extremely rare in the [[Crust (geology)|earth's crust]] because it is a [[siderophile]], and therefore most of it travelled with the [[iron]] as it sank into the [[Structure of the Earth #Core|earth's core]] during [[planetary differentiation]].  As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an [[asteroid]] struck the earth at the time of the K<U+2013>T boundary.<ref name="Alvarez">{{cite journal|title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction|author=Alvarez, LW, Alvarez, W, Asaro, F, and Michel, HV|date=1980|journal=Science|volume=208|issue=4448|pages=1095<U+2013>1108|doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095}}</ref>  There were other earlier speculations on the possibility of an [[impact event]], but no evidence had been uncovered at that time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=De Laubenfels, MW|title=Dinosaur Extinctions: One More Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume= 30|issue=1|pages=207<U+2013>218|date=1956|url=http://www.norwebster.com/astrohit/|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref>

The obvious consequence of an impact would be a dust cloud which would block [[sunlight]] and inhibit photosynthesis for a few years. This would account for the extinction of [[plants]] and [[phytoplankton]] and of [[organisms]] dependent on them (including [[predators|predatory animals]] as well as [[herbivores]]). However, small creatures whose food chains were based on [[detritus]] might have still had a reasonable chance of survival.  It is estimated that [[sulfuric acid]] [[aerosol]]s were injected into the [[stratosphere]], leading to a 10<U+2013>20% reduction in sunlight reaching the earth's surface.  It would have taken at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate.<ref name="Pope"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Ocampo, A, Vajda, V & Buffetaut, E|title=Unravelling the Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene (KT) Turnover, Evidence from Flora, Fauna and Geology in Biological Processes Associated with Impact Events (Cockell, C, Gilmour, I & Koeberl, C, editors)|publisher=SpringerLink|date=2006|pages=197<U+2013>219|isbn=978-3-540-25735-6|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vw75014157p2p278/|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> 
The consequences of reentry of ejecta into Earth's atmosphere may have included a brief (hours long) but intense pulse of [[infrared|infrared radiation]] of an intensity similar to an [[oven]] set to [[broiling|broil]], killing exposed organisms.<ref name=Robertson/> Global [[firestorm]]s may have also resulted as incendiary fragments from the blast fell back to Earth. Analyses of [[fluid inclusions]] in ancient [[amber]] suggest that the [[oxygen]] content of the atmosphere was very high (30<U+2013>35%) during the late Cretaceous. This high O<sub>2</sub> level would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> plummeted in the early Tertiary Period. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary [[greenhouse effect]] once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable survivors of the "long winter".<ref name="Pope">{{cite journal|title=Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub Cretaceous/Tertiary impact|author=Pope, KO, Baines, KH, Ocampo, AC, & Ivanov, BA|date=1997|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=102|issue=E9|pages=21645<U+2013>21664|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1997/97JE01743.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>

The impact may also have produced [[acid rain]], depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor. [[Buffer solution|Chemical buffers]] would have limited the changes, and the survival of animals vulnerable to [[acid rain]] effects (such as [[frog]]s) indicate this was not a major contributor to extinction.  Impact theories can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulphuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time<U+2014>possibly under ten years.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kring, DA|date=2003|title=Environmental consequences of impact cratering events as a function of ambient conditions on Earth|journal=Astrobiology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=133<U+2013>152|id=PMID 12809133}}</ref>
Subsequent research, however, identified the [[Chicxulub Crater]] buried under [[Chicxulub, Yucat<U+00E1>n|Chicxulub]] on the coast of [[Yucatan]], [[Mexico]] as the impact crater which matched the Alvarez hypothesis dating. Identified in 1990 based on the work of Glen Penfield done in 1978, this crater is oval, with an average diameter of about {{km to mi|180}}, about the size calculated by the Alvarez team.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pope KO, Ocampo AC, Kinsland GL, Smith R | title=Surface expression of the Chicxulub crater | journal=[[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | year=1996 | pages=527-30 | id=PMID 11539331}}</ref><ref name="Keller">{{cite journal|author=Keller, G, Adatte, T, Stinnesbeck, W, Rebolledo-Vieyra, Fucugauchi, JU, Kramar, U, & St<U+00FC>ben, D|date=2004|title=Chicxulub impact predates the K-T boundary mass extinction|journal=PNAS|volume=101|pages=3753<U+2013>3758|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400396101 }}</ref>

The shape and location of the crater indicate further causes of devastation in addition to the dust cloud. The asteroid landed right on the coast and would have caused gigantic [[tsunami]]s, for which evidence has been found all round the coast of the Caribbean and eastern United States<U+2014>marine sand in locations which were then inland, and vegetation debris and terrestrial rocks in marine sediments dated to the time of the impact. The asteroid landed in a bed of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulphate), which would have produced a vast sulphur dioxide [[aerosol]]. This would have further reduced the sunlight reaching the earth's surface and then precipitated as acid rain, killing vegetation, plankton and organisms which build shells from calcium carbonate ([[coccolithophorids]] and [[molluscs]]). The crater's shape suggests that the asteroid landed at an angle of 20&deg; to 30&deg;From horizontal and traveling north-west. This would have directed most of the blast and solid debris into the central part of what is now the United States. Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 65&nbsp;mya, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions.<ref name="Keller"/><ref name="Morgan">{{cite journal|title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub|author=Morgan, J, Lana, C, Kersley, A, Coles, B, Belcher, C, Montanari, S, Diaz-Martinez, E, Barbosa, A & Neumann, V|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=251|issue=3<U+2013>4|date=2006|pages=264<U+2013>279|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009}}</ref>

===Deccan Traps===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]] -->
{{main|Deccan Traps}}

Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&nbsp;mya and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two-thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in 1 million years about 65.5&nbsp;mya, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hofman, C, F<U+00E9>raud, G & Courtillot, V|date=2000|title=40Ar/39Ar dating of mineral separates and whole rocks from the Western Ghats lava pile: further constraints on duration and age of the Deccan traps|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=180|pages=13<U+2013>27|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00159-X}}</ref><ref name="Duncan">{{cite journal|title=Rapid eruption of the Deccan flood basalts at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary|author=Duncan, RA & Pyle, DG|date=1988|journal=Nature|volume=333|pages=841<U+2013>843|doi=10.1038/333841a0}}</ref>

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reducing photosynthesis in plants.  In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name="Duncan"/>

In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that [[paleontologists]] were being misled by [[Signor-Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alvarez, W|title=T. rex and the Crater of Doom|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691016306|pages=130<U+2013>146}}</ref>

===Multiple impact event===
Several other craters also appear to have been formed about the time of the K<U+2013>T boundary. This suggests the possibility of near simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary impact with [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Among these are the [[Boltysh crater]], a {{km to mi|24}} diameter impact crater in the [[Ukraine]] {{nowrap|(65.17 <U+00B1> 0.64 mya);}} the [[Silverpit crater]], a {{km to mi|20}} diameter impact crater in the [[North Sea]] {{nowrap|(60<U+2013>65 mya).}}  Any other craters that might have formed in the [[Tethys Ocean]] would have been obscured by tectonic events like the relentless northward drift of Africa and India.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mullen, L|date= [[October 13]] [[2004]]|title= Debating the Dinosaur Extinction| url= http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1243.html|journal=Astrobiology Magazine|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Mullen, L| date= [[October 20]], [[2004]] | title=Multiple impacts|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1253.html|journal=Astrobiology Magazine|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref><ref name="Mullen Shiva">{{cite journal|author=Mullen, L|date=[[November 03]] [[2004]]|title=Shiva:  Another K<U+2013>T impact?|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1281.html|journal=Astrobiology Magazine|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref>

===Maastrichtian sea-level regression===
There is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the [[Mesozoic]] era. In some [[Maastrichtian]] [[Faunal stage|stage]] rock layers from various parts of the world, the later ones are terrestrial; earlier ones represent shorelines and the earliest represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with [[Orogeny|mountain building]], therefore, the likeliest explanation is a "regression", that is, a drop in sea level. There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the explanation which is currently accepted as the most likely is that the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]] became less active and therefore sank under their own weight.<ref name="MacLeod"/><ref> {{cite journal|title=Abrupt deep-sea warming at the end of the Cretaceous|journal=Geology|date=1998|first=L|last=Liangquan|coauthors=Keller, G|volume=26|issue=|pages=995<U+2013>998|id= |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/11/995|format=|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

A severe regression would have greatly reduced the [[continental shelf]] area, which is the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a ''marine'' mass extinction. However research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction.  The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the earth's [[albedo]] and therefore increasing global temperatures.<ref name="Marshall"/>

Marine regression also resulted in the loss of [[epeiric sea]]s, such as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] of North America.  The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing [[coastal plain]]s that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. Another consequence was an expansion of [[freshwater]] environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to [[freshwater]] [[vertebrates]], those that prefer [[ocean|marine]] environments, such as [[shark]]s, suffered.<ref name=AF04/>
