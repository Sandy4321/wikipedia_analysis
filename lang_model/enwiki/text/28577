'''''Guitar Hero II''''' is a [[music video game]] and a sequel to ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. The second entry in the [[Guitar Hero (series)|''Guitar Hero'' series]], it was developed by [[Harmonix Music Systems]] and published by [[RedOctane]]. It was first released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in November [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/701/701726p3.html|title=IGN: Guitar Hero II Interview|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> The game was later released for the [[Xbox 360]] in April [[2007]], with additional content not originally in the PlayStation 2 version.<ref>{{cite web| title = Xbox.com - Guitar Hero II| publisher = Microsoft Corporation| url = http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/g/guitarhero2/| accessdate = 2007-07-24 }}</ref>

Like the original ''Guitar Hero'', the player uses a [[guitar]]-shaped peripheral to play [[rock music|rock songs]] as [[note]]s scroll towards the player. Most of the gameplay from the original game remains intact, with new modes and note combinations being the major additions. The game features more than 40 popular licensed songs, many of them [[cover version]]s recorded for the game, spanning five decades (from the 1960s to the 2000s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/737/737956p1.html|title=Guitar Hero II Final Tracklist Revealed|date=2006-10-06|last=Roper|first=Chris|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>

The PlayStation 2 version of ''Guitar Hero II'' can be purchased individually or in a bundle that packages the game with a cherry red [[Gibson SG]] guitar controller. The Xbox 360 version of the game is offered in a bundle that packages the game with a white [[Gibson X-Plorer]] guitar controller. Both of these controllers are wired, but RedOctane also sells a wireless controller for the PlayStation 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redoctane.com/gh-sgwireless.html|title=Guitar Hero<U+2122> Wireless Controller (Guitar Only)|accessdate=2007-07-18|publisher=RedOctane}}</ref>

Since its release, ''Guitar Hero II'' has been met with both critical and commercial success, helping the ''Guitar Hero'' series become a cultural phenomenon.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/fashion/15guitar.html|title=Virtual Frets, Actual Sweat|publisher=New York Times|last=Zezima|first=K.|date=2007-07-14|accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref> It has spawned a spin-off, ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'' for the PlayStation 2. As of July 2007, a full-fledged sequel, ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', is currently under development by [[Neversoft]], the makers of the popular [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk'' series]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=14971|title=Gamedaily: Guitar Hero Development Goes to Neversoft|publisher=GameDaily|date=2007-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-26|last=Brightman|first=James}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{seealso|Guitar Hero (series)#Common Gameplay Elements|l1=Common gameplay elements in the Guitar Hero series}}
Gameplay is based on the successful formula created for the first ''Guitar Hero'' game; the player may use the guitar peripheral to play scrolling notes by holding the corresponding fret button on the guitar neck and simultaneously pressing the strum bar. Alternatively, one can play with the [[DualShock#DualShock 2|DualShock 2]] or Xbox 360  controller by using 4 shoulder buttons and a face button, mapped to specific fret keys.<ref name="ps2-manual-controller">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=RedOctane | title=PlayStation 2 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=3 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95023-226-US}}</ref><ref name="xbox-manual-controller">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=RedOctane | title=Xbox 360 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=3 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95057-226-US}}</ref>

Several changes have been made to the gameplay mechanics for ''Guitar Hero II'': [[hammer-on]] and [[pull-off]] functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics available for a song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either ''Quick Play'' or ''Career'' mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list.<ref name="gamezone review"/> The handedness of the guitar can now be toggled from the Pause menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's main menu). For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the Leaderboard feature, and there are 50 [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|Achievements]] that can be earned in the game.<ref name="xbox-manual-xbl">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=RedOctane | title=Xbox 360 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=8-9 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95057-226-US}}</ref><ref name="GameSpot review Xbox 360"/>

=== Career ===
[[Image:Guitar-hero-2-xbox360-screen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Screenshot from the Xbox 360 version of the game, displaying the scoring meter (left), the guitar fretboard (middle), and the Rock and Star Power Meters (right).]]
In Career mode, players create a band name and select a guitarist from among the available characters. Eight characters are available from the start of the game: Eddie Knox, Axel Steel, Casey Lynch, Lars <U+00DC>mla<U+00FC>t, Izzy Sparks, Judy Nails, Johnny Napalm, and Pandora.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarherogame.com/gh2/|title=Character List at Official Site|publisher=RedOctane|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> Additional characters &mdash; Clive Winston, Xavier Stone and the Grim Ripper &mdash; can also be purchased, allowing them to be used in later sessions.

Only the lead guitar is available to be played in the Career mode. Over the course of the Career mode the band plays at eight available venues. The venue system from the original game has been altered slightly. Every venue is in a different city, and the Career mode has the band traveling from town to town in order to play at the next arena. The band starts out at Nilbog High School, in an unspecified city in [[Ohio]] referred to only as the "[[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]", at a [[Battle of the Bands]] competition. Then the band progresses to bigger [[New England]] venues: the Rat Cellar Pub in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] (paying homage to the legendary, defunct punk-rock club [[The Rathskeller]], or "The Rat", which was located in Kenmore Square); the Blackout Bar in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; the RedOctane Club in [[Brooklyn]], New York; and the Rock City Theater in [[Detroit, Michigan]] (named after the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] song "[[Detroit Rock City (song)|Detroit Rock City]]"); before crossing back to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], making a stop at the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] in [[Austin, Texas]]; the Harmonix Arena in [[Oakland, California]]; and culminating at [[Stonehenge]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Guitar Hero II Review + Song List| publisher = Fullspectrumottawa.com - Exposure Online Magazine| url = http://www.fullspectrumottawa.com/exposure/exposure_guitar_hero_ii_song_list.php| accessdate = 2007-07-24 }}</ref> The latter is a reference to the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' in which the band performed the song "Stonehenge" on stage with a model of the monument. The venues feature [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[pyrotechnics]] that are synchronized with the music.<ref name="GamePro review PS2"/>

Not all songs in the main set list are available from the start. Once a song is unlocked for play within Career mode, it becomes available for play in all other modes. When working through Career mode at a specific difficulty level, the next tier of songs is unlocked once the required number of songs on the current tier (3-5, depending on difficulty and console) are completed. Additionally, the encore song for a particular tier is only made available once its requirements are completed. On the Easy difficulty setting, there no encores are available, but the next tier will be unlocked immediately after completing the required songs in the previous tier.<ref name="gamezone review">{{cite web | url = http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r29286.htm | title = Guitar Hero II Review | last = Watkins | first = Rob | date = 2006-11-10 | accessdate = 2007-07-26 | publisher = Game Zone }}</ref>

Successful completion of a song on Medium or higher difficulty during Career mode will earn the player in-game cash. Higher difficulty levels{{Fact|date=July 2007}} and better scoring performances are rewarded with more cash.<ref name ="worth playing review">{{cite web | url = http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=38695&mode=thread&order=0 | title = PS2 Review - 'Guitar Hero II' | date  =2006-11-16 | accessdate=2007-07-26 | publisher = Worth Playing}}</ref>  In-game money can be used at ''The Store'' to buy various items. Some items are available only after completing all songs at higher difficulty levels or 5-star performances.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}  Purchases in ''The Store'' carry over to each difficulty in career mode and all game modes.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Within ''The Store'', the player can purchase new [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] guitars, guitar finishes, three additional characters, alternate outfits for the eight characters available from the start, bonus songs, and videos.<ref name="xbox-manual-store">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=RedOctane | title=Xbox 360 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=8 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95057-226-US}}</ref>  Within the Xbox 360 version, there is also an option to access the ''Guitar Hero II'' content on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].<ref name="xbox-manual-xbl"/>

=== Multiplayer ===
<!--[[Image:Guitar-hero-2-xbox360-multiplayer.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Screenshot of the Cooperative mode from the Xbox 360 version of ''Guitar Hero II''.]]-->
[[Image:Guitar Hero II PS2 co-op screen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In cooperative multiplayer, the two players share their score, Rock Meter, and Star Power.  Screenshot from the PlayStation 2 version.]]
There are three different multiplayer modes available:<ref name="xbox-manual-mpmodes">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=RedOctane | title=Xbox 360 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=8-9 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95057-226-US}}</ref><ref name="GameSpot review PS2"/>
*'''Cooperative'''
:One player plays lead guitar while another plays either [[bass guitar]] or [[rhythm guitar]], depending on the song. Both players share a score, rock meter, star power meter, and streak multiplier. Cooperative mode is the only multiplayer mode in which a song can be failed. Star power can only be activated by both players simultaneously.
*'''Face-Off'''
:This is the same multiplayer mode as featured in the original game, though in ''Guitar Hero II'' both players can individually select their level of difficulty.  In this mode, players alternate between playing sections of each song. The scores are weighted so that a player who hits more notes on Easy difficulty may not necessarily win against an opponent on Expert difficulty who hits less notes.
*'''Pro Face-Off'''
:Players play the full lead guitar track on the same difficulty. For the PlayStation 2 mode, this is available upon completion of any career level<ref name="ps2-manual-proface">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=RedOctane | title=PlayStation 2 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=8 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95023-226-US}}</ref>, while for the Xbox 360 version, the mode is unlocked after completing the career mode at Medium level or higher.<ref name="xbox-manual-proface">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=RedOctane | title=Xbox 360 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=9 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95057-226-US}}</ref> The score system is identical as the song could be played alone, but songs cannot be failed in this mode.

While online multiplayer was not available at the release of ''Guitar Hero II'' for the Xbox 360, RedOctane has stated that they hope to be able provide this later once they are able to work out the technical issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/guitar-hero-2/754599p2.html|title=Gamespy - CES 2007 Preview for Guitar Hero II for the Xbox 360|date=2007-01-11|last=Accardo|first=Sal|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>

=== Practice ===
Practice mode is a new addition to the game, allowing a player to practice certain sections of a song ("Verse 2," "Chorus," "Bridge 3," etc.) on different difficulties and instruments.<ref name="1UP.com review Xbox 360"/> Practice mode gives the player the ability to toggle the speed of the notes (Full Speed, Slow, Slower and Slowest) and does not stop a song no matter how many mistakes are made. Players can play the [[bass guitar]] lines on most songs. On others, a [[rhythm guitar]] line is available instead.<ref name="xbox-manual-practice">{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=RedOctane | title=Xbox 360 Guitar Hero II Instruction Manual | pages=9 | publisher=RedOctane|language=English|id=95057-226-US}}</ref>

== Soundtrack ==
{{main|List of songs in Guitar Hero II}}
Both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions of ''Guitar Hero II'' feature the same core 64 playable songs (40 licensed, 24 bonus songs).<ref>{{cite web| author=Roper, Chris|date=2006-10-09|title = IGN: Guitar Hero II Final Tracklist Revealed | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/737/737921p1.html|work=ign.com|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> The Xbox 360 version contains 10 exclusive tracks not included in the PlayStation 2 version, in addition to downloadable songs that can be purchased on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] in packs of three for 500 [[Microsoft Points]] ([[United States dollar|US$]]6.25) per pack. In addition to exclusive tracks, the Xbox 360 version features a reorganized set list that progresses in difficulty better than the PlayStation 2 version.<ref name="GameSpot review Xbox 360"/>

Most of the songs featured are [[cover version]]s, with the exception of "Stop", "Dead!", "[[Possum Kingdom]]", "[[John the Fisherman]]" and the unlockable bonus songs (which are original artist performances). <ref>{{cite web| title = Guitar Hero II Review | last = Sellers| first = Pete| publisher = Deeko Entertainment| date = 2006-11-07| url = http://www.deeko.com/ps2/reviewdetail.asp?id=752| accessdate = 2007-07-24 }}</ref> Cover songs are credited on screen with the phrase "as made famous by" (for example, "[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]], as made famous by [[Cheap Trick]]"), while the original songs are credited with "as performed by" (for example, "John the Fisherman, as performed by [[Primus (band)|Primus]]").

RedOctane has stated that the Xbox 360 version of "''Guitar Hero II'' is planned to feature more downloadable content than any other 360 title".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/764/764899p1.html|title= Guitar Hero II 360 Interview|last=Kolan|first=Patrick|publisher=IGN|date=2007-02-14|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>

== Featured instruments ==
''Guitar Hero II'' features many popular real world [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Epiphone]], and [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] guitars, <ref>{{cite web| title = Guitar Hero II Demos at E3 (Press Release)| publisher = Reverb Communications, Inc| date = 2006-05-05| url = http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001852.html| format = HTML| accessdate = 2007-07-24 }}</ref>including the [[Gibson Les Paul]], [[Gibson SG]], and [[Gibson Explorer]]. Oddities such as the double necked [[Gibson EDS-1275]] and unusual looking [[Gibson Corvus]] also make an appearance. Several available finishes are also recognizable from popular guitarists, including [[Zakk Wylde]]'s bullseye Les Paul. As play progresses, several custom shaped guitars become available, although some are notable in the real world such as the USA and Battle Axe (a similar looking bass is played by [[Gene Simmons]] and guitar was played by [[John Christ]] of [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]]/[[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] fame). Basses, such as the [[Music Man StingRay]], [[Gibson Thunderbird]], and the [[H<U+00F6>fner]] bass are also available for co-op play.

The band itself plays with [[Orange Music Electronic Company|Orange]] amps and [[Drum Workshop|DW]] drum kits, along with more in-game endorsements. When the player passes each set of songs in career mode, his/her band is rewarded with money and equipment endorsements, including [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] effects, [[Line 6]] guitar amplifiers, VHT amplifiers, [[Mesa Boogie]] amplifiers, and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] keyboards. These products then appear on stage while the band plays the ensuing setlists.<ref name="A_Day_Spent_with_GHII">{{cite web| title = A Day Spent in the Presence of the Mighty Guitar Hero 2 | url = http://ulo.tricho.us/?p=63|date=2006-08-05|accessdate=2007-07-27|last=Neiburger|first=Eli}}</ref>

The PlayStation 2 version of ''Guitar Hero II'' was welcomed with very positive reviews. It received a 10/10 review in the December issue of ''[[Official PlayStation Magazine]]'' and was awarded the Game of the Month award. The game received a rating of 9.5/10 from [[IGN]],<ref name="IGN review PS2"/> ranking higher than the original game in the series and amongst IGN's highest rated PS2 games ever. It was also nominated for Best Game of 2006 on [[Gametrailers]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Game Of The Year Awards 06 |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player.php?id=16209&type=mov&pl=game|publisher=Gametrailers|date=2007-01-11|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] reviewed the PlayStation 2 version with a rating of 8.7/10,<ref name="GameSpot review PS2"/> and the Xbox 360 version 8.9,<ref name="GameSpot review Xbox 360"/> both slightly lower than its predecessor. ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave it a 9 out of 10, while its "second opinion" rating was even better, at 9.25/10. According to [[Game Rankings]],<ref name="Game Rankings score PS2"/> the average critic score of ''Guitar Hero II'' is 93%, making it the 9th best reviewed game of 2006.

The Xbox 360 version has earned similarly positive reviews and slightly higher scores with a 9.5/10 in the March issue of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'',{{Fact|date=July 2007}} a 4.75/5 from ''[[GamePro]]'', a 9.5/10 from ''[[Play Magazine]]'' and a 9.4/10 from [[IGN]]. As of [[April 3]] [[2007]], the Game Rankings score is 94%.<ref name="Game Rankings score Xbox 360"/> The popular [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] television show [[X-Play]] gave both versions of the game a 5 out of 5. Additionally, the Australian Xbox Magazine has also awarded the game, for the first time, an 11/10, in a reference to ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Common praise for the game by critics is aimed at the new multiplayer and practice modes.<ref name="1UP.com review Xbox 360"/><ref name="worth playing review"/> Common critiques concern the song list, which includes more hard rock and metal than the previous game, deeming it less accessible to casual players.<ref name="1UP.com review Xbox 360"/> Other common critiques concern the quality of the covers.<ref name="GameSpot review Xbox 360"/>

The downloadable song packs for the Xbox 360 version have been criticized for being too pricy. Each song is priced at 166.67 MSP using the [[Microsoft Points]] system, which is approximately $2.08 [[USD]] for one song. The price was seen by many fans of the series as being far too expensive and was met with resistance and angst with a large number of people pledging to boycott the content.<ref name="major nelson 3 song packs"/> Microsoft's Xbox Live Director of Programming, [[Major Nelson]], defending the pricing and release scheme, and attributed the high cost of the content to "licensing issues" on the Xbox 360 platform, as all contracts drawn up for songs from the original game had to be rewritten, since they are playable on an additional console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/04/12/major-nelson-talks-guitar-hero-downloads-halo-3/|title=Joystiq - Major Nelson Talks Guitar Hero Downloads, Halo 3|accessdate=2007-05-21|last=Yoon|first=Andrew|date=2007-04-12|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref>

In [[1UP.com]]'s review for the Xbox 360 version of the game, the downloadable song packs are noted as a "mixed blessing"; praise is given for retooling the songs with better gameplay elements such as the inclusion of co-op modes, but the fact that the songs come in pricy packs of three "defeats much of the appeal".<ref name="1UP.com review Xbox 360"/> In an interview with [[RedOctane]] president Kai Huang,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/780/780829p2.html | title = Rocking on with Guitar Hero|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Burman|first=Rob|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref> Huang stated that the decision to pack the songs in three was made to keep the cost of the tracks down. Though Huang felt the pricing was fair, he noted afterward "we do listen to the fans and take any feedback we receive seriously." On [[July 12]], [[2007]], Dusty Welch of RedOctane has stated that there has been over 300,000 downloads of the music packs to date, and that the current prices were "very attractive and desirable for consumers."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070712/wr_nm/gamesexpo_activision_dc;_ylt=ApxJtTdQy_TT9_YHguMnK1MK77EF | title = Activision to stick to "Guitar Hero" song price | date = 2007-07-12 | accessdate = 2007-07-13 | publisher = Reuters }}</ref>

=== Sales ===
In December 2006, ''Guitar Hero II'' for PlayStation 2 was the second top-selling video game of the month,<ref name="1UP NPD 2006">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3156365|title=NPD Releases December Numbers, Fanboys Riot|date=2007-01-11|accessdate=2007-07-27|publisher=1up|last=Klepek|first=Patrick}}</ref> selling 805,200 units. It was outsold only by ''[[Gears of War]]'' for Xbox 360 (which sold 815,700 units).<ref name="1UP NPD 2006"/>

It was the fifth top-selling video game of the fiscal year of 2006, with 1.3 million copies sold. It was also the third best-selling game for the PlayStation 2, behind ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.<ref name="1UP NPD 2006"/>

In total, ''Guitar Hero II'' has sold over 3 million copies.<ref name="nytimes"/>

== Technical issues ==
No official statement from [[RedOctane]] or [[Activision]] has been made about the discs or the game itself having any issues, but players have reported songs freezing or skipping, causing the audio to be unsynchronized, unusually long loading screens, and menus that freeze or lock up entirely causing the game to crash. The RedOctane Support Center Answer Guide states, "We<U+2019>re already in the process of looking into this and testing to replicate the experience. We<U+2019>ll notify everyone with our results shortly, and will have a positive resolution if need be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redoctane.us/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=2&id=120|title=RedOctane Support Center|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref><!-- Dead link -->

Two models of the Xplorer controller were released for the Xbox 360 version of the game: model numbers 95055 and 95065. Of the two versions, the 95055 has an [[RJ-11]] jack for effect pedals near the controller cord and is suspect to having an unresponsive [[whammy bar]]. RedOctane later responded, saying that they "isolated this issue to two model numbers that can be found on the guitar's packaging". Customers are able to exchange these models for new models.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sliwinksi | first = Alexander | title = Red Octane Says Two Xbox Guitar Models Defective | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | date = [[2007-04-07]] | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2007/04/07/red-octane-says-two-xbox-guitar-models-defective/ | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}</ref>

On [[April 13]], [[2007]], Activision revealed that the issue was not a problem with the hardware, and that the guitars were ''not'' defective. The cause of the problem was anti-cheat protection software, and Activision released a patch on Xbox Live on [[April 14]], [[2007]] to remedy it.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamestooge.com/2007/04/13/guitar-hero-ii-360-its-not-the-guitar-its-the-software/|title= It's Not the Guitar, It's the Software!|date=2007-04-13|accessdate=2007-07-27|last=Schommer|first=Derrick|publisher=Gamestooge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://forum.guitarherogame.com/Default.aspx?g=posts&t=18566 |title= RedOctane post information Guitar Hero II patch|date=2007-04-13|accessdate=2007-07-27|publisher=Guitar Hero Forums}}</ref> However, this patch may have caused some unintended side effects. Starting on [[April 16]], [[2007]], numerous users began reporting lockups and failures of their system (such as the ''[[Red Ring of Death]]'') after downloading and installing this patch, causing them to require hardware repair service through Microsoft. RedOctane stated, "We're aware of the problem and we're looking into it."<ref>{{cite web | title = RedOctane admits to Guitar Hero II patch problem | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = [[2007-04-16]] | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=75328 | accessdate = 2007-04-17 |last=Bramwell|first=Tom}}</ref>
