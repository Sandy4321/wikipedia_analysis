It was published in Japan and North America by [[Square Enix]] and in European territories by [[Take-Two Interactive]]. It was released on September 11 2003 in Japan, on March 2 2004 in North America, and on May 21 2004 in Europe. A Europe-exclusive [[mobile phone]] adaptation of ''Drakengard'' was co-developed and co-published by [[Square Enix]] and [[Macrospace]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mobile.square-enix-europe.com/news/news-detail.asp?nid=105 | title=Square Enix and Macrospace Team Up For Mobile Content | accessdate=2007-07-30 | date=2004-07-08 | work=[http://mobile.square-enix-europe.com/home.asp Square Enix Mobile (Europe)] | publisher=[[Square Enix]]}}</ref> The game is the first installment of the [[Drakengard (series)|''Drakengard'' series]], featuring a mixture of ground-based hack-and-slash and aerial combat, and role-playing elements that have become a staple of the series.

The game's story features Caim, a deposed prince of the Union, in his quest for vengeance against the Empire. Wounded in battle while protecting his sister Furiae, he is forced to make a pact with a red dragon named Angelus. As they journey together, they join with Hierarch Verdelet on a quest to prevent the Empire from destroying magical seals that keep the world in balance: Furiae acts as the central seal, and if she dies, the world will fall into chaos.

The game was conceived by Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki as a hybrid between the popular ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' series and Cavia's aerial combat game ''[[Ace Combat]]''. It was Shiba's first project as a producer. The game's dark story was created by Taro Yoko, who also directed the game, and Sawako Natori, who wrote the majority of the script. The game's music was written by [[Nobuyoshi Sano]] and Takayuki Aihara. The game sold well in Japan and received mixed to positive reviews in the west: reviewers praised the game's story and music, but were mixed about the graphics and criticized the gameplay for being repetitive.

''Drakengard'' features three basic gameplay types: ground missions, aerial missions, and Free Expedition Mode. Each level has a time limit of one hour for the player to complete them.<ref name= "VGdg1"/> The gameplay combines a mixture of hack-and-slash similar to the ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' series, and aerial segments reminiscent of ''[[Panzer Dragoon]]''. In some levels, players can switch between ground-based and aerial combat.<ref name= "GSpreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/drakengard-preview/1100-6086793/|title=Drakengard Preview|author=Gamespot staff|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|date=2004-01-21|accessdate=2014-03-26}}</ref> The game is divided into thirteen chapters.<ref name= "GSpreview"/> Each of these chapters are divided into verses, which act as the game's levels. Normal verses are numbered: the additional verses are marked by Roman numerals. The game features five endings: the normal ending and four additional endings are achieved when certain conditions are met, such as completing optional chapters or obtaining powerful weapons.<ref name= "RPGtips">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgsite.net/feature/3255-hacking-and-slashing-through-drakengard-tips-for-new-pact-partners|title=Hacking and Slashing Through Drakengard: Tips for New Pact-Partners|author=Henges, Elizabeth|publisher=RPGSite|date=2014-01-26|accessdate=2014-03-26}}</ref> The gameplay modes are called Ground Mode, Strafe Mode, and Air Mode.<ref name= "DGgameplay">{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/01/23/drakengard-progress-report|title=Drakengard Progress Report|author=Dunham, Jeremy|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-01-22|accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref> Players can navigate the game world and select missions via a world-map accessed between levels. While playing, a mini-map allows the player to see enemy locations, and a full-screen map can be switched to that covers the entire area and shows mission objectives.<ref name= "GSdg1"/>

Ground-based gameplay primarily has the player controlling the main protagonist Caim. He has access to three types of attack: a standard sword-slash, a magic attack and a dash attack that throws enemies to the ground.<ref name= "VGdg1"/> Additional weapons can be accessed and swapped via the menu. Weapons can be leveled up through use, with each having a four-level cap. The player can access up to eight weapons during a mission.<ref name= "DGgameplay"/><ref name= "GSdg1"/> Pressing the attack button repeatedly while in combat with enemy units triggers combos, and pressing another button mid-combo will trigger a special attack which will temporarily incapacitate enemy units in the immediate area. The player can also temporarily switch between Caim and an assigned ally, who shares similar attacks but deals more damage.<ref name= "GSdg1"/> These allies are gained in optional chapters and can only be summoned a limited number of times.<ref name= "RPGtips"/>

In aerial combat missions, the player controls Caim's dragon partner Angelus. During these moments, players are directed against multiple aerial targets which must be destroyed for the player to win. Angelus gains experience points and levels up through combat similar to the weapons for ground-based combat. Boss battles are all located in these aerial stages.<ref name= "GSdg1"/> Angelus has access to two types of standard fire attacks: a free-aim blast which causes high damage, and homing bolts which can hit multiple targets but do less damage. Homing shots can be dodged or countered by some enemy types later in the game.<ref name= "RPGtips"/> She can also perform a special area-affecting magical attack which damages or kills multiple enemy units in an area. Angelus can be quickly used to traverse battle areas during primarily ground-based missions.<ref name= "VGdg1"/> Angelus can be summoned during certain ground-based missions and played in "Strafe Mode". Controls are identical to ground-based combat. Pressing the select button causes Caim to dismount Angelus.<ref name= "DGgameplay"/> Caim and Angelus level up during combat in different ways: as Caim levels up, the two's shared health meter grows, while Angelus' leveling increases the damage her attacks do to enemy units.<ref name= "RPGtips"/>

The mobile phone port of the game features four different locations and two battle modes: a side-scrolling ground mode and an aerial dragon-riding mode. Achieving high scores unlocks hints and tips for the PlayStation 2 version of the game.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mobile.square-enix-europe.com/games/games-detail.asp?gid=38 | title=Game Details: Drakengard | accessdate=2007-07-30 | work=[http://mobile.square-enix-europe.com/home.asp Square Enix Mobile (Europe)] | publisher=[[Square Enix]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007001517/http://mobile.square-enix-europe.com/games/games-detail.asp?gid=38 |archivedate = 2007-10-07}}</ref>

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===
{{Main|Characters of the Drakengard series}}
''Drakengard'' takes place in an unnamed medieval [[dark fantasy]] world, called Midgard in the official guide. Midgard is protected from falling into chaos by the Seals, magical objects tied to a living female chosen as a Goddess of the Seal: the Goddess lives as a hermit, and the destruction of the seals and her allows malevolent beings known as the Watchers ({{nihongo|Angels|<U+5929><U+4F7F>|Tenshi}} in the Japanese version) to enter the world and begin destroying humanity.<ref name="DODguide1">{{cite book |title=Drag-On Dragoon Official Guide Book |publisher=Square Enix |location=Tokyo |isbn=4757510314 |language=Japanese |date=2003-10-24}}</ref> A key element of the world is the ability for a human and a beast to form a pact, a magical ritual that ties their souls together and grants great power: their lives become bound by the pact, and the human pays a price for it in the form of some attribute (i.e. their voice, their eyesight or their ability to age). During the events of ''Drakengard'', the Union, which protects the Seals, is in the midst of a religious war with the Empire, a power led by a cult who believe that destroying the seals will bring them good fortune.<ref name="DODguide2">{{cite book |title=Drag-On Dragoon Official Guide Book |publisher=Square Enix |location=Tokyo |isbn=4757510314 |page=191 |language=Japanese |date=2003-10-24}}</ref>

Other prominent characters are {{nihongo|Furiae|<U+30D5><U+30EA><U+30A2><U+30A8>|Furiae}}, Caim's sister and the current Goddess of the Seal; {{nihongo|Inuart|<U+30A4><U+30A6><U+30F4><U+30A1><U+30EB><U+30C8>|Iuvaruto}}, Furiae's former fiance; and {{nihongo|Manah|<U+30DE><U+30CA>|Mana}}, Seere's sister, leader of the enemy cult and the game's main antagonist.

===Story===
During a battle with the forces of the Empire to protect Furiae, Caim is severely injured. Encountering Angelus wounded from torture, the two agree to make a pact and save each other.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Drakengard|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=2 March 2004|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=Verse 3|level=Chapter 1|language=|quote='''Caim''': A dragon!

Eventually, Furiae and Inuart are captured by the Empire, with Inuart being tortured and brainwashed by Manah. Verdelet and Caim travel to each of the Seals, but each time arrive too late to stop them being destroyed. Along the way, Caim and Verdelet are joined by Leonard and Seere, and take along Arioch to protect others from her madness. Eventually, the Union and the Empire engage in battle and the Union are victorious. After the battle, however, the Union's surviving troops are decimated by an unknown force and the Empire's troops return to life.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Drakengard|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=2 March 2004|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=Verse 7|level=Chapter 5|language=English|quote='''Text''': As the fire falls from the sky, Imperial solders rise one by one from the dead, like demons of the underworld. }}</ref> Caim and Angelus travel to a fortress that has appeared in the sky, where they find that Furiae has killed herself, breaking the final seal.

Defeated, Manah asks them to kill her, but Angelus declares that she must live with her crimes.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Drakengard|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=2 March 2004|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=Verse 8|level=Chapter 8|language=English|quote='''Manah''': Kill me, kill me.

As Verdelet performs the ritual, Angelus tells Caim her name before fading away.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Drakengard|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=Square Enix|date=2 March 2004|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=Verse 9|level=Chapter 8|language=|quote='''Angelus''': I have never...seen you weep before.

Subsequent playthroughs and extra chapters reveal further details about the characters. Leonard's self-imposed seclusion is because he was trying to suppress his [[pedophilia]], and the guilt at his brothers' deaths stems from the fact that he gave in to his cravings and left them unprotected.<ref name="QUOTEleonard">{{cite video game|title=Drag-On Dragoon|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=2003-10-11|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=|level=Leonard's Regret|language=Japanese|quote=}}</ref> Arioch's madness takes the form of cannibalism of children, with her believing that they would be safe from harm within her.<ref name="QUOTEarioch">{{cite video game|title=Drag-On Dragoon|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=2003-10-11|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=|level=Arioch's Madness|language=Japanese|quote=}}</ref> Furiae is also revealed to feel romantic love for Caim, which led to Inuart becoming jealous and easily turned against them during his captivity.

There are four possible alternative endings. In the second ending, Inuart manages to place Furiae's body inside a Seed of Resurrection, turning her into a monster which kills him. Caim kills her, but not before the other Seeds produce clones of her that will destroy humanity.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Drakengard|developer=[[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]|publisher=Square Enix|date=2 March 2004|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=Verse 6|level=Chapter 9|language=|quote='''Text''': Caim stands alone, holding the remains of Furiae in his arms.

==Development==
The original idea for ''Drakengard'' originated between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki when they were working at Cavia.

The game underwent multiple changes for its western release. The game's original title ''Drag-On Dragoon'' was chosen for its sound, and was not considered right for the western market. Because of this, it was changed to ''Drakengard''.<ref name="IGN1"/><ref name= "EuroInterview"/> The game also underwent major debugging and an alteration in the angle of the in-game camera.<ref name= "EuroInterview"/> In addition to this, some of the more mature themes, such as references to sexual taboos, were censored in the western localization.<ref name= "DODcensor">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/10/11/drakengard-3-connects-nier-will-balance-darkness-humor/|title=Drakengard 3 Connects To Nier, Will Have A Balance Between Darkness And Humor|author=Hawkins, Matt|publisher=Siliconera|date=2013-10-13|accessdate=2013-12-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131218203606/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/10/11/drakengard-3-connects-nier-will-balance-darkness-humor/|archivedate=2013-12-18|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The music for the game was composed by [[Nobuyoshi Sano]] and Takayuki Aihara. In creating the score, the two took multiple samples from pieces of classical music. They then rearranged the pieces, remixed and layered them in various ways. The main objective of the composers was to create music that emulated the game's hack-and-slash gameplay, and well as the dark story and general narrative theme of "madness". The music was intended to be "experimental" and "expressionistic" rather than "commercial". After composition, all the tracks were performed by a full orchestra.<ref name= "SEmusicLiners">{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/drakengard.shtml|title=Drag-on Dragoon Original Soundtrack :: Liner Notes Translated by Ben Schweitzer|author=Schweitzer, Ben|publisher=Square Enix Music|accessdate=2014-02-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140222144620/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/drakengard.shtml|archivedate=2014-02-22|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The team who worked on the music were the same team who worked on the ''[[Tekken]]'' series, and they sought to emulate the music of Northern Europe.<ref name="IGN1"/> The soundtrack features multiple samples from the works of classical composers, selected by Aihara.<ref name= "SEmusicLiners"/> The game's theme song, {{nihongo|"Exhausted"|<U+5C3D><U+304D><U+308B>|Tsukiru}}, was composed by Sano, written by Natori and sung by [[Eriko Hatsune]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/lyrics/drakengard/exhausted.shtml|title=Square Enix Music Online :: Drakengard - Exhausted|publisher=Square Enix Music|accessdate=2014-03-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140301164247/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/lyrics/drakengard/exhausted.shtml|archivedate=2014-03-01|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The soundtrack was originally released in two volumes.

The story received the highest amount of praise. [[IGN]]'s Jeremy Dunham called it the game's "biggest strength", praising the edgy themes the game explored, the balance between fantasy and the realistic world and character design, and the multiple parallels with ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''.<ref name= "IGNdg1"/> The reviewer for [[Computer and Video Games]] (CVG) praised the "the maturity and wit of the dialogue and unfolding plot", saying it seemed to surpass other RPGs produced by Square Enix at the time.<ref name= "CGVreview"/> [[VideoGamer.com]]'s Adam Jarvis praised the game's storytelling style, saying that while the story became "a little bogged down at various points, it is deep enough to keep your interest throughout the game."<ref name= "VGdg1"/> [[Gamespot]]'s Greg Kavasin said that "though the story itself is awkwardly paced and is sometimes difficult to keep up with, it becomes one of the main motivating factors for wanting to get all the way through to the end of the game."<ref name= "GSdg1"/>

The graphics received mixed responses. Kavasin said the game "looks decent but, ultimately, not all that good", criticizing the bland environments and awkward movements for enemy units and the playable character, but praising the design of the dragon.<ref name= "GSdg1"/> The reviewer for [[Game Informer]] was more positive, praising the graphical detail and cutscenes and the look of enemy units, despite some pop-up issues and framerate dips.<ref name= "GIdg1"/> Jarvis praised the design of the main cast, but cited the repetitive enemy design and dark environments as detracting elements.<ref name= "VGdg1"/> Dunham praised the character and monster designs as well as the full-motion cutscenes, but was less impressed by the repetitive enemy designs, bland environments and low draw distance.<ref name= "IGNdg1"/> The full-motion videos were also praised by the CVG reviewer.<ref name= "CGVreview"/> Reaction to the sound design was mixed to positive. Dunham praised the majority of the British-style voice acting, but called the music "disappointing".<ref name= "IGNdg1"/> Game Informer cited the low number of background tracks and voice acting "straight out of a renaissance festival" as poorer parts of the game.<ref name= "GIdg1"/> Kavasin praised the voice acting and called the music "the most nerve-racking and most intense aspect of the game."<ref name= "GSdg1"/> Jarvis was also positive, praising the sound design for battles, most of the voice acting and the music, which "[helped] create a suitably dark atmosphere."<ref name= "VGdg1"/>

Reception of the gameplay was mixed to negative, with Dunham saying it suffered the same problems as its derivative games despite its easy entertainment value,<ref name= "IGNdg1"/> and Jarvis calling the options in gameplay "fairly limited".<ref name= "VGdg1"/> Though citing it as repetitive, The CVG reviewer praised the aerial segments of gameplay, calling them the most entertaining segments, and that the standard combat served to embellish the protagonist's "kick-ass persona, making him more than just another anonymous dragon rider".<ref name= "CGVreview"/> Kavasin was exceptionally critical, saying that the gameplay both made the process of playing laborious and detracted from the main story.<ref name= "GSdg1"/> Game Informer called the gameplay "fun, but [lacking] any semblance of depth."<ref name= "GIdg1"/>
