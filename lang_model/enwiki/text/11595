'''Portman Road''' is an association football stadium in [[Ipswich]], Suffolk, England. It has been the home ground of [[Ipswich Town F.C.]] since 1884. The stadium has also hosted a number of England youth international matches, and one [[England national football team|senior England]] [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] international match, against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in 2003. It has staged several other sporting events, including athletics meetings and international [[Field hockey|hockey]] matches.

The stadium underwent significant redevelopments in the early 2000s, which increased the capacity from 22,600 to a current figure of 30,311, making it the largest capacity football ground in [[East Anglia]]. Each of its four stands have since been converted to [[All-seater stadium|all-seater]], following the recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]]. Also located at the ground are conference and banqueting facilities, the ''Sir Bobby Robson Suite'', ''Legends Bar'' and a club store selling Ipswich Town merchandise.

More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890.<ref name=stadium/> At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] played a Suffolk County Football Association team.

Meanwhile, ground development continued with roofing enhancements to the North Stand and an increase in capacity to 31,500 by 1963.  Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year lease on the ground with owners [[Ipswich Borough Council]].<ref name=p_of_a/>

The  two-tier propped cantilever Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, providing 3,500 additional seats and increasing the capacity of the ground to approximately 37,000.  Advertising appeared around the perimeter of the ground in the same year, while the following year saw the construction of the "Centre Spot" restaurant underneath the Portman Stand.  Additional seating was added to the Portman Stand in 1974 and the ground saw its record attendance of 38,010 the following year in an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].  Following success in the [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978 FA Cup]], the club invested in 24 executive boxes in front of the Portman Stand and, as a result of the Safety of Sports Ground Act (1975), reduced the capacity in front by introducing seats, taking the overall capacity down to 34,600.<ref name=stadium/><ref name=p_of_a/>
