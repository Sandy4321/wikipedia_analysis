'''''Horae Canonicae''''' is a series of poems by [[W. H. Auden]] written between [[1949 in poetry|1949]] and [[1955 in poetry|1955]]. The title is a reference to the [[canonical hours]] of the [[Christian Church]], as are the titles of the seven poems constituting the series: "[[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]]", "[[Terce]]", "[[Sext]]", "[[None (liturgy)|Nones]]", "[[Vespers]]", "[[Compline]]", and "[[Lauds]]". Each refers to a fixed time of the day for prayer. 

The canonical hours create a framework for the dramatization of Auden's religious position, which he described in a letter as "very much the same as [[Reinhold Neibuhr|Reinhold [Neibuhr]'s]], i.e. [[Augustinian]], not [[Thomist]] (I would
allow a little more place, perhaps, for the ''[[Via Negativa]]''.) Liturgically, I am
[[Anglo-Catholic]]<U+2026>".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Curtis, Jan|title=W. H.

"Prime" and "Nones" were first published in Auden's collection ''[[Nones (Auden)|Nones]]'' ([[1951 in poetry|1951]]). ''Horae Canonicae'' was published as a unity in Auden's ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1955).
