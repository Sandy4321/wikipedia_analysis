The '''Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial''' began on [[May 3]], [[2000]], which was 11 years, four months and 13 days after the blowing up of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] on [[December 21]], [[1988]].

A [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[High Court of Justiciary]] was purpose-built at the neutral venue of [[Camp Zeist, Netherlands]], a former [[United States Air Force]] base. Facilities for a high security prison were also installed there. Under a bilateral [[treaty]]<ref>[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20702/volume-702-I-10089-English.pdf#page99 Treaty concerning the trial (page 99)]</ref> between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], these premises were, for the duration of the [[trial (law)|trial]] and any subsequent [[appeal]], under the authority and control of the Scottish Court. Dutch law still theoretically applied to the area, but, barring an emergency, the Dutch authorities were banned from entering the premises and the Court had the authority to enact regulations that superseded Dutch law when necessary for the execution of the trial<ref>articles 5 and 6</ref>, and to jail people for [[contempt of court]]<ref>article 3 (3) d</ref>. The court itself, as well as people involved in the trial (officials of the court, accused, witnesses, solicitors, ...) also enjoy total or partial immunity from Dutch law<ref>articles 8-10, 14-17</ref>.

==Venue==
[[Image:PA103judges.jpg|right|thumb|The [[High Court of Justiciary]] at Camp Zeist]]
Upon the indictment of the two Libyan suspects in November 1991, the Libyan government was called upon to extradite them for trial in either the United Kingdom or the United States. Since no bilateral extradition treaty was in force between any of the three countries, Libya refused to hand the men over but did offer to detain them for trial in Libya, as long as all the incriminating evidence was provided. The offer was unacceptable to the US and UK, and there was an [[impasse]] for the next three years.

In November 1994, President [[Nelson Mandela]] offered [[South Africa]] as a neutral venue for the trial but this was rejected by the then [[British prime minister]], [[John Major]].<ref>[http://www.dispatch.co.za/1997/10/27/page%2013.htm Families say SA trial site acceptable]</ref> A further three years elapsed until Mandela's offer was repeated to Major's successor, [[Tony Blair]], when the president visited [[London]] in July 1997 and again at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997|1997 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM) in [[Edinburgh]] in October 1997.  At the latter meeting, Mandela warned that "no one nation should be complainant, prosecutor and judge" in the Lockerbie case.

The eventually agreed compromise solution of a trial in the [[Netherlands]] governed by Scots law was engineered by legal academic [[Robert Black (professor)|Professor Robert Black]] of [[Edinburgh University]] and, as endorsing Britain's new, ethical foreign policy, was given political impetus by the then foreign secretary, [[Robin Cook]].

==Accused==

Two Libyans were accused of the crime. They were named as [[Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi]] and [[Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah]]. In the run-up to the trial, the prosecution had considered bringing charges against Swiss businessman, [[Edwin Bollier]], of the electronics firm [[Mebo]] Ag, but decided that, unless evidence to incriminate Bollier were to be adduced during the trial, he would not be included as a co-conspirator in causing the bombing.

[[Libya]] made three stipulations, when agreeing to hand over the two accused to the Scottish police: that they would not be interviewed by the police; no one else in Libya would be sought for the bombing; and, that the trial should be before three Scottish judges, sitting without a [[jury]]. On [[April 5]], [[1999]], over a year ahead of the start of the trial, [[Megrahi]] and [[Fhimah]] arrived in the [[Netherlands]].

==Charges==

The two accused denied all charges against them. Three outline charges were:

*[[murder]];
*[[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to murder; and,
*a breach of the Aviation Security Act 1982.

The full charges included the names of the murdered 259 passengers and crew of [[Pan Am Flight 103]], and the eleven residents killed at [[Lockerbie]] in [[Scotland]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/newsid_493000/493242.stm Full charges, and names of 270 victims]</ref>

==Judges==

The Scottish [[High Court of Justiciary]] at [[Camp Zeist, Netherlands]] was presided over by three senior judges and an additional judge (non-voting):<ref>[http://www.terrorismcentral.com/Library/Legal/HCJ/Lockerbie/TheJudges.html Lockerbie trial Judges]</ref>

*Presiding Judge: Lord Sutherland ([[Ranald Ian Sutherland]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]), the longest serving of Scotland's judges;
*Lord Coulsfield ([[John Taylor Cameron]] QC);
*Lord MacLean ([[Ranald Norman Murdo MacLean]] QC); and,
*Additional judge: Lord Abernathy ([[John Alastair Cameron]] QC).

==Prosecution==

There were five [[Lord Advocate]]s from the 1991 [[indictment]] of the two accused Libyans until their trial in 2000 - three Conservative: [[Lord Fraser of Carmyllie]], Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, and two Labour: Lord Hardie and [[Lord Boyd of Duncansby]]. Lord Boyd led the prosecution on behalf of [[the Crown]]. Assisting him were Advocate Deputes [[Alastair Campbell, Lord Bracadale|Alastair Campbell QC]] and [[Alan Turnbull, Lord Turnbull|Alan Turnbull QC]]. Alongside the prosecution were seated [[U.S. Department of Justice]] representatives Brian Murtagh, who had helped draw up the indictment against the two accused, and Dana Biehl.

Five years after the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, who issued the arrest warrants in 1991, was alleged to have said that he was not entirely happy with the evidence presented against Megrahi during his trial in 2000, and in his subsequent appeal in 2002. However, he made it clear that this did not mean that he believed Megrahi to be innocent. According to ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' of [[October 23]], [[2005]], Lord Fraser allegedly cast doubt upon the reliability of the main prosecution witness, [[Tony Gauci]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2090-1839307,00.html Doubts about Tony Gauci's evidence]</ref>

==Defence==

Representing [[Megrahi]] were his [[solicitor]], Alistair Duff, and [[advocate]]s [[William Taylor QC]], David Burns QC and [[John Beckett QC|John Beckett]]. [[Fhimah]] was represented by solicitor Eddie McKechnie, advocates Richard Keen QC, Jack Davidson QC and Murdo Macleod. Both defendants also had access to Libyan defence lawyer, Mr. Maghour.

==Pre-trial hearings==
Five pre-trial hearings took place: the accused waived their right to attend two procedural hearings at the high court in Edinburgh; they attended two hearings at Camp Zeist which were held in private; and, on [[December 7]], [[1999]] they made their first public appearance before the [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]]. At this public hearing the presiding judge, Lord Sutherland, ruled that:

*the two Libyans must face charges of ''conspiracy'' as well as murder;

*they can be described as members of their country's intelligence services; and,

*the start of the full trial is to be delayed by three months (from [[February 2]], [[2000]]).

==Proceedings==
Court proceedings started on [[May 3]], [[2000]] with the prosecution outlining the case against the accused and previewing the evidence which they expected would satisfy the judges ''beyond reasonable doubt'' that the sabotage of PA 103 was caused by:

*the explosion of an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED);
*an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] that was contained within a Toshiba radio cassette player in a hard-shell Samsonite suitcase along with various items of clothing which had been bought in Mary's House, Sliema, Malta;
*an IED triggered by the use of an MST-13 timer, manufactured by [[Mebo]] Ag in Switzerland; and,
*the so-called ''primary suitcase'' being introduced as unaccompanied baggage at [[Luqa Airport]] in Malta, conveyed by Air Malta flight KM180 to [[Frankfurt International Airport]], transferred there onto feeder flight PA 103A to [[Heathrow Airport]], loaded into the interline baggage container AVE 4041PA at Heathrow, and put on board PA 103 in the forward cargo hold.

In the trial's second week, Detective Constable Gilchrist was asked about the piece of charred material that he and DC McColm had found three weeks after the PA 103 crash. DC Gilchrist attached a label to the material and wrote "Cloth (charred)" on it. The word 'cloth' was overwritten by the word 'debris'. DC Gilchrist's attempts to explain the overwriting were later described by the judges as "at worst evasive and at best confusing."

There was no third week and, because of equipment problems in the courtroom, only a truncated fourth week. In week 5, Professor Peel of the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA) gave evidence concerning the baggage container AVE 4041PA.

Week 6 was devoted to the testimony behind screens of [[CIA]] agents and [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] officers relating to interception of arms caches (including MST-13 timers) in the West African countries of [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].

In week 7 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/792623.stm Alan Feraday], also of [[DERA]], gave evidence. Feraday presented the court with a simulated IED of the type alleged to have caused the sabotage of PA 103. Under cross-examination, he admitted the fragments of radio cassette and timer, found in DC Gilchrist's ''cloth/debris (charred)'' material, had not been tested for explosives residue. The defence were, however, later criticized for having failed to challenge Feraday to explain why his note to Detective Chief Inspector William Williamson in September 1989, covering a Polaroid photograph of the timer fragment (identified in May 1989), said it was "the best I can do in such a short time."

Later in week 7, the co-founder of [[Mebo|Mebo Ag]], [[Erwin Meister]], testified that Mebo had supplied Libya with 20 MST-13 timing devices, and identified one of the two accused ([[Megrahi]]) as a former business contact. The defence asked Meister, under cross-examination, to explain the purpose of his visit to [[Syria]] in 1984. 

Meister's partner, [[Edwin Bollier]], was questioned in week 8. Bollier said Mebo made a range of products including briefcases equipped to radio-detonate IEDs. He agreed that Mebo had sold 20 MST-13 timers to Libya in 1985 which were later tested by Libyan [[special forces]] at their base at [[Sabha]]. Bollier said: "I was present when two such timers were included in bomb cylinders". In court, Bollier was shown a number of [[printed circuit board]] fragments which he identified as coming from the Mebo MST-13 timer, but he claimed that these timer fragments appeared to have been modified.

Joachim Wenzel, an employee of the [[Stasi]], the former East German intelligence agency, testified behind screens in week 9. Wenzel claimed to have been Bollier's handler in the years 1982-85 and testified that Mebo had supplied the Stasi with timers.

Former Mebo employee, [[Ulrich Lumpert]], confirmed that as an electronics engineer he had produced all of the firm's MST-13 timers. Lumpert agreed that the fragments shown to him in court "could be" from that timer and was asked to confirm his signature on a letter concerning a technical fault with the prototype MST-13 timer. The trial was then adjourned until [[July 12]], [[2000]]. (On [[July 18]], [[2007]] Lumpert admitted he had lied at the trial.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2160655,00.html Vital Lockerbie evidence 'was tampered with']</ref> In a sworn [[affidavit]] before a [[Zurich]] [[Notary public|notary]], Lumpert stated that he had stolen a prototype MST-13 timer [[printed circuit board|PC-board]] from Mebo and gave it without permission on [[June 22]], [[1989]], to "an official person investigating the Lockerbie case".<ref>[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1664337.0.0.php Probe into Lockerbie timer claims]</ref> Dr [[Hans K<U+00F6>chler]], UN observer at the Lockerbie trial, who was sent a copy of Lumpert's affidavit, said: "The Scottish authorities are now obliged to investigate this situation. Not only has Mr Lumpert admitted to stealing a sample of the timer, but to the fact he gave it to an official and then lied in court".)

In week 11, Mebo lawyer Dieter Neupert filed an official criminal complaint against [[the Crown]] over what he alleged was a 'forged fragment of MST-13 timer'.<ref>[http://www.mebocom-defilee.ch/ceocities/neupert117.htm Alleged 'forged fragment of MST-13 timer]</ref> [[Tony Gauci]] of Mary's House, Sliema in Malta, testified that he had sold a number of items of clothing to one of the defendants, [[Megrahi]]. Wilfred Borg, Ground Operations Manager at Malta's Luqa airport, was questioned about Luqa's baggage handling procedures. A Mr Ferrugia confirmed that he had been a passenger on Air Malta flight KM 180 to Frankfurt on [[December 21]], [[1988]].

Two Germans, Birgit Seliger and Evelin Steinwandt, confirmed in week 12 that they had also travelled on flight KM 180. Martin Huebner and Joachim Koscha were questioned about baggage handling procedures at Frankfurt airport.

Five more passengers on flight KM 180 testified in week 13. The captain of flight KM 180, Khalil Lahoud, also gave evidence and was asked to confirm that the aircraft's altitude during the flight had exceeded 30,000ft. This information was intended to demonstrate that an IED loaded at Luqa airport would have had a timed detonator rather than a [[barometric]] trigger. The trial was then adjourned until [[August 22]], [[2000]].

In week 17, another four passengers on flight KM 180 were asked to testify. The following week, [[Abdul Majid Giaka]], a defector from the Libyan intelligence service, appeared wearing sunglasses and a wig. [[Giaka]], who had been on the US [[Witness Protection Program]] since July 1991, testified that [[Megrahi]] was a Libyan agent.

Rather than calling the defendants to the witness stand, their legal team sought to use the special defence of incrimination against the person or persons they believed were guilty of the crime. There was speculation that [[Mohammed Abu Talb]], a convicted PFLP-GC member, would be called by the defence to testify in week 19, and when he failed to appear the trial was adjourned for the next five weeks to allow new evidence from a "country in the Mid East" to be examined.

One of the last witnesses for the prosecution was broadcaster and politician, [[Pierre Salinger]], who was questioned by prosecutor Alan Turnbull and by both defence counsel William Taylor and Richard Keen. After his testimony, judge Lord Sutherland asked Salinger to leave the [[witness box]]. However, the broadcaster responded:
:"That's all? You're not letting me tell the truth. Wait a minute, I know exactly who did it. I know how it was done."
But Lord Sutherland told Salinger:
:"If you wish to make a point you may do so elsewhere, but I'm afraid you may not do so in this court."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1033601.stm Salinger told to leave witness box]</ref>
  
[[Abu Talb]] finally gave evidence in week 25 and testified that he had been babysitting at home in Sweden when PA 103 was sabotaged on [[December 21]], [[1988]]. 

The Crown concluded the prosecution case in week 26. In its closing address for [[Fhimah]] in weeks 26 and 27, the defence submitted there was no case for him to answer. There were no weeks 28 to 32.

The expected documents from the "country in the Mid East" - thought to be Syria - had not materialized by week 33, and the defence confirmed that the accused would not take the witness stand. The prosecution dropped two of the three charges against the accused, leaving the single charge of murder against both [[Megrahi]] and [[Fhimah]]. The defence claimed the accused had no case to answer.

In week 34 the defence argued that the IED started its journey at Heathrow, rather than Luqa airport in Malta. The judges then retired to consider their verdict.

There was no week 35. The judges announced their verdict on [[January 31]], [[2001]] in week 36.

==Verdict==
In addition to the options of [[guilt (law)|guilty]] and [[not guilty]], a third [[verdict]] of [[not proven]] was available to the judges under [[Scots Law]]. The judges announced their verdicts on [[January 31]], [[2001]] and were unanimous in finding the second accused, [[Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah]], [[not guilty]] of the murder charge.<ref>[http://i-p-o.org/Lockerbie_Verdict-31Jan2001.htm Fhimah was found "not guilty"]</ref> Fhimah was freed and he returned to his home at Souk al-Juma in [[Libya]] on [[February 1]], [[2001]]. As for [[Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi]] the judges said: "There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the first accused, and accordingly we find him [[guilty]] of the remaining charge in the [[indictment]] as amended." <ref>[http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/0131lockerbieverdict.pdf Lockerbie trial verdict]</ref> [[Megrahi]] was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], with a recommendation that he should serve at least 20 years before being eligible for [[parole]].

==Appeal==
[[Image:Megrahi-incourt.jpg|right|thumb|[[Megrahi]] during appeal proceedings]]
The defence team had just 14 days in which to appeal against Megrahi's conviction on [[January 31]], [[2001]] and a further six weeks to submit the full grounds of the appeal. These were considered by a judge sitting in private who decided to grant Megrahi leave to appeal. The only basis for an appeal under Scots law is that there has been a "[[miscarriage of justice]]" which is not defined in statute and so it is for the appeal court to determine the meaning of these words in each case. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1764532.stm 14 days to launch appeal]</ref> Because three judges and one alternate judge had presided over the trial, five judges were required to preside over the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]]:
*[[Lord Cullen]], [[Lord Justice-General]]
*Lord Kirkwood
*Lord Osborne
*Lord Macfadyen and
*Lord Nimmo Smith
In what was described as a milestone in Scottish legal history, Lord Cullen granted the [[BBC]] permission in January 2002 to televise the appeal, and to broadcast it on the [[Internet]] in English with a simultaneous Arabic translation.

William Taylor QC, leading the defence, said at the appeal's opening on [[January 23]], [[2002]] that the three trial judges sitting without a jury had failed to see the relevance of "significant" evidence and had accepted unreliable facts. He argued that the verdict was not one that a reasonable jury in an ordinary trial could have reached if it were given proper directions by the judge. The grounds of the appeal rested on two areas of evidence where the defence claimed the original court was mistaken: the evidence of Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, which the judges accepted as sufficient to prove that the "primary suitcase" started its journey in Malta; and, disputing the prosecution's case, fresh evidence would be adduced to show that the bomb's journey actually started at Heathrow. That evidence, which was not heard at the trial, showed that at some time in the two hours before 00:35 on [[December 21]], [[1988]] a padlock had been forced on a secure door giving access airside in Terminal 3 of Heathrow airport, near to the area referred to at the trial as the "baggage build-up area". Taylor claimed that the PA 103 bomb could have been planted then. Extracts of the full grounds of appeal are listed here.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1778449.stm Grounds of appeal (extracts]</ref>

On [[March 14]], [[2002]] it took Lord Cullen less than three minutes to deliver the decision of the High Court of Justiciary. The five judges refused the appeal, ruling unanimously that "none of the grounds of appeal was well-founded", adding "this brings proceedings to an end". The following day, a helicopter took Megrahi from Camp Zeist to continue his [[life sentence]] in Barlinnie Prison, [[Glasgow]].

==SCCRC==
The [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] ([[SCCRC]]), which was established by Act of Parliament in April 1999, has wide-ranging powers to investigate cases where a miscarriage of justice is alleged, and has been reviewing Megrahi's case since September 2003. Although the Commission normally expects to review a case and announce its decision within 12 months, it took nearly four years to complete the Megrahi review. On [[28 June]] [[2007]] the SCCRC published a summary of its 800-page report and referred Megrahi's conviction to the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] for a fresh appeal. The SCCRC's findings were examined in detail by [[Al Jazeera]] in two episodes of the network's ''People & Power'' series in July 2007.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/431180B8-E6E7-4BB2-A6Af-BBF438EED228.htm Lockerbie bombing probe: a look into the findings of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]</ref> 

==Remarks by Lord Fraser==
''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' of [[October 23]], [[2005]] reported that [[Lord Fraser of Carmyllie]], who drew up the 1991 [[indictment]] against the two accused Libyans and issued warrants for their arrest, had now cast doubt upon the reliability of the main prosecution witness, Tony Gauci. Lord Fraser criticised the Maltese shopkeeper for ''inter alia'' being "not quite the full shilling" and an "apple short of a picnic".

The then Lord Advocate, Lord Boyd, reacted to the remarks, as follows:
:"It was Lord Fraser who, as Lord Advocate, initiated the Lockerbie prosecution. At no stage, then or since, has he conveyed any reservation about any aspect of the prosecution to those who worked on the case, or to anyone in the prosecution service."
Lord Boyd has asked Lord Fraser to clarify his apparent attack on Gauci by issuing a public statement of explanation.

[[William Taylor QC]], who defended Megrahi at the trial and the appeal, said Lord Fraser should never have presented Gauci as a crown witness:
:"A man who has a public office, who is prosecuting in the criminal courts in Scotland, has got a duty to put forward evidence based upon people he considers to be reliable. He was prepared to advance Gauci as a witness of truth in terms of identification and, if he had these misgivings about him, they should have surfaced at the time. The fact that he is coming out many years later after my former client has been in prison for nearly four and a half years is nothing short of disgraceful. Gauci's evidence was absolutely central to the conviction and for Peter Fraser not to realise that is scandalous," Taylor said.

[[Tam Dalyell]], former Labour MP who played a crucial role in organising the trial at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, described Lord Fraser's remarks as an 'extraordinary development':
:"I think there is an obligation for the chairman and members of the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] to ask Lord Fraser to see them and testify under oath - it's that serious. Fraser should have said this at the time and, if not then, he was under a moral obligation to do so before the trial at Zeist. I think there will be all sorts of consequences," Dalyell declared.

Gerard Sinclair, chief executive of the SCCRC, refused to say whether the Commission was investigating Lord Fraser's reported remarks. "Any investigation we carry out we seek to do so as rigorously and as thoroughly as possible," he said.

[[Robert Black (professor)|Robert Black]], Professor Emeritus of [[Scots Law]] at Edinburgh University and a Lockerbie expert, described the alleged remarks as "an indication that various people who have been involved in the Lockerbie prosecution are now positioning themselves in anticipation of the SCCRC holding that there was a ''prima facie'' miscarriage of justice, and sending it back for a fresh appeal."

==UN observer==

Professor [[Hans K<U+00F6>chler]], who was appointed as one of the UN observers by UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], criticised the trial in his report and evaluation. K<U+00F6>chler observed that the trial had been politically influenced in breach of legal traditions and principles, such as the [[Rule of law]].<ref>[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/koechl.htm UN observer at the Lockerbie trial, Dr Hans K<U+00F6>chler]</ref> In an interview for the BBC on the day the first appeal was rejected, he described the court's decision as a "spectacular miscarriage of justice".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1872996.stm 'Spectacular miscarriage of justice']</ref><ref>[http://i-p-o.org/koechler-lockerbie-appeal_report.htm Dr K<U+00F6>chler's report on the Lockerbie appeal]</ref>

In a radio programme entitled ''Politics and justice: the Lockerbie trial'', which was broadcast on 9 September 2007 by Australia's ''ABC National Radio'', Dr K<U+00F6>chler, Professor Robert Black and [[Dr Jim Swire]] expressed their views on the Lockerbie trial and the first appeal, and suggested what should happen next. A transcript of the radio programme is available, or it can be listened to here.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/rearvision/stories/2007/2024833.htm ''Politics and justice: the Lockerbie trial'', ABC National Radio (Australia)]</ref>

In the June 2008 edition of the Scottish lawyers' magazine ''The Firm'', K<U+00F6>chler referred to the 'totalitarian' nature of the ongoing second Lockerbie appeal process saying it "bears the hallmarks of an 'intelligence operation'."<ref>[http://www.thefirmmagazine.com/news/901/UN_Observer_to_the_Lockerbie_Trial_says_%E2%80%98totalitarian%E2%80%99_appeal_process_bears_the_hallmarks_of_an_%E2%80%9Cintelligence_operation%E2%80%9D_.html UN Observer to the Lockerbie Trial says 'totalitarian' appeal process bears the hallmarks of an "intelligence operation"]</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article4138649.ece Lockerbie bomber hearing 'flawed']</ref>

==Second appeal==

The second appeal is expected to be heard by five Scottish judges in 2009 at the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]]. A procedural hearing at the Appeal Court in [[Edinburgh]] took place on [[October 11]], [[2007]] when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence counsel, [[Margaret Scott (lawyer)|Maggie Scott QC]], discussed legal issues with a panel of three judges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7037821.stm|title=Lockerbie bomber in fresh appeal}}</ref> One of the issues concerns a number of [[CIA]] documents that were shown to the prosecution but were not disclosed to the defence. The documents are understood to relate to the [[Mebo]] MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7023397.stm|title='Secret' Lockerbie report claim}}</ref> Further procedural hearings were scheduled to take place between December 2007 and June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/7422010.stm|title=Lockerbie documents security plea}}</ref>

Pointing out an error on the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]]'s website and accusing the British government of "delaying tactics" in relation to Megrahi's second Lockerbie appeal, UN Observer at the [[Lockerbie trial]] Dr [[Hans K<U+00F6>chler]] wrote to Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] on 21 July 2008 saying:<ref>[http://www.mathaba.net/rss/?x=599526 "Lockerbie Appeal : Making Haste Slowly", ''Mathaba Net News'', 23 July 2008]</ref>
<blockquote>As international observer, appointed by the [[United Nations]], at the [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]] I am also concerned about the [[Public Interest Immunity]] (PII) certificate which has been issued by you in connection with the new Appeal of the convicted Libyan national. Withholding of evidence from the Defence was one of the reasons why the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] has referred Mr. Al-Megrahi<U+2019>s case back to the [[High Court of Justiciary]]. The Appeal cannot go ahead if the Government of the United Kingdom, through the PII certificate issued by you, denies the Defence the right (also guaranteed under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) to have access to a document which is in the possession of the Prosecution. How can there be equality of arms in such a situation? How can the independence of the judiciary be upheld if the executive power interferes into the appeal process in such a way?</blockquote>

The FCO corrected the error on its website and wrote to K<U+00F6>chler on 27 August 2008:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i-p-o.org/IPO-nr-Lockerbie-FCO-01Sept08.htm |title=FCO reply dated 27 August 2008|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><blockquote>"Ultimately, it will be for the Court to decide whether the material should be disclosed, not the Foreign Secretary."</blockquote>

In September 2008, following an application made at a closed hearing of the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, it was reported that a security-vetted Defence Counsel is to be appointed to examine the disputed document. The court's decision on the application has not been published but in a letter seen by [[BBC Scotland]], FCO minister [[Kim Howells]] says it has decided to appoint a special defender. In a BBC interview, [[Hans K<U+00F6>chler]], criticised the development as "intolerable" and "detrimental to the rule of law." K<U+00F6>chler said:<ref>{{cite web|title=Appeal court plans Lockerbie move|date=2008-09-17|publisher=[[BBC Scotland]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/7622223.stm |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref><blockquote>"In no country can the situation be allowed where the accused or the appellant is not free to have his own defence team, and instead someone is imposed upon him."</blockquote>

On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided unanimously to reject a submission by the [[The Crown|Crown]] that the scope of Megrahi's second appeal should be limited to the specific grounds of appeal that were identified by the [[SCCRC]] in June 2007.<ref>[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2008HCJAC58.html Judgment on the scope of Megrahi's second appeal]</ref>

On 21 October 2008 Megrahi's lawyer, revealed that his client had been diagnosed with "advanced stage" [[prostate cancer]]. Despite the appeals of [[Jim Swire]], that keeping Megrahi behind bars while he battled the disease "would amount to exquisite torture", the High Court ruled on 14 November 2008 that Megrahi should remain in jail while his appeal continued.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6236538.stm Timeline: Lockerbie bombing, BBC]</ref>
