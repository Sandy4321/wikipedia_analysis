'''Gabriel Jones''' (May 17, 1724 <U+2013> October 1806) was an [[18th century]] [[Welsh American]] [[lawyer]], [[legislator]], [[court clerk]], and [[civil servant]] in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later [[U.S. state]]) of [[Virginia]]. Jones served as the Clerk of Court for [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]) for a tenure lasting 25 years (1757<U+2013>1782) and represented [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]], Hampshire, and [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta]] counties as a member of the [[House of Burgesses of Virginia]]. In addition, Jones also served as the [[County attorney|King's Attorney]] for Augusta County and as the [[coroner]] for Frederick County. He was elected to represent Virginia at the [[Continental Congress]], but did not attend, and participated in the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]]. Jones was an uncle of American [[wikt:pioneer|pioneer]] [[John Gabriel Jones]] (1752<U+2013>1776) and he was a friend of both [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].

== Early life and education ==
Gabriel Jones was born on May 17, 1724<ref name = "Munske1">{{Harvnb|Munske|2004|p=39.}}</ref><ref name = "Waddell1">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=392.}}</ref> approximately {{convert|3|mi}} from [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]],<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Loth2">{{Harvnb|Loth|2008|p=11.}}</ref> which was then the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Colony of Virginia]]. He was a son of John and Elizabeth Jones,<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> who had arrived in Virginia several years earlier from [[Montgomeryshire]] in northern [[Wales]], where Jones's family was of [[gentry|noble]] descent.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> Jones's elder sister Elizabeth was born on August 13, 1721 at the [[College of William & Mary]] in Williamsburg<ref name = "Waddell1"/> and his younger brother John was born on June 12, 1725 at the same location as Jones.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> 

According to Jones family tradition, Jones's father lost a significant amount of his [[wealth]] while in Virginia, which brought about his family's return to [[England]] in 1727.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Jones's father's death prior to 1727 also precipitated the family's move and following their relocation to England, Elizabeth raised Jones and his siblings in [[London]] where she had Jones's sister [[baptism|baptized]] at [[St Giles in the Fields]] on February 20, 1727.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> 

In April 1732, Jones was granted admission to [[Christ's Hospital]] (also known as "The Bluecoat School") in London following his presentation by Thomas Sandford.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green1">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=86.}}</ref> Jones attended Christ's Hospital for seven years.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> On April 12, 1739, he was discharged from the institution by his mother and John Houghton, a [[Solicitor]] in the [[Court of Chancery]] and of [[Lyon's Inn]] in [[Middlesex]].<ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green1"/> Despite its noble origins, Jones's family was of limited means,<ref name = "Waddell1"/>{{efn|name=coin}} and he served as an [[Indenture|indentured]] [[apprentice]] under Houghton's charge for a term of six years until 1745.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> At the age of 21, Jones was [[Admission to practice law|admitted to practice law]] following the completion of his apprenticeship.<ref name = "Waddell1"/>

== Political career == 
===Return to Virginia===
Following his admission to the bar and the death of his mother in 1745,<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> Jones was persuaded by either [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]],<ref name = "Munske1"/> the [[Land tenure|landowner]] of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], or his relative [[Hugh Mercer]] to return to Virginia.<ref name = "Green1"/> Once he was "free of his indentures" and had "attained his majority,"<ref name = "Waddell1"/> Jones secured his return to Virginia.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> He settled first in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]<ref name = "Loth2"/> and later relocated to Frederick County, after which on March 1, 1747,<ref name = "Waddell1"/> he acquired a [[Land lot|tract of land]] along [[Opequon Creek]] near present-day [[Kernstown, Virginia|Kernstown]], where he resided for several years.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> 

===House of Burgesses tenures===
Jones was appointed to serve as the first [[county attorney|King's Attorney]] for [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] around April 1746, at the age of 22.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green2">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=87.}}</ref><ref name = "Waddell2">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=23.}}</ref><ref name = "Waddell6">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=31.}}</ref> The county's court recommended Jones to the position, citing him "as a fit person to transact His Majesty's affairs in this county."<ref name = "Waddell6"/> Jones continued to reside in Frederick County while performing the duties of King's Attorney in Augusta County.<ref name = "Waddell4">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=393.}}</ref> When the first appointed [[justice]]s of Augusta County assembled on December 9, 1745, the body qualified Jones to practice as an "attorney-at-law" in the county.<ref name = "Waddell3">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=27.}}</ref> He was the first lawyer to reside within the then-boundaries of Augusta County.<ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones served in that position for two years until his [[election]] to represent [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] as a member of the [[House of Burgesses of Virginia]] in 1748<ref name = "Munske1"/> and he was subsequently re-elected to his seat for the 1749 [[legislative session]].<ref name = "Munske1"/> 

Jones was again elected to represent Frederick County in the House of Burgesses in 1752, but resigned in 1753 to serve as the county's [[corner]].<ref name = "Munske1"/> In 1753, Jones relocated from Kernstown in Frederick County, to his estate "[[Bogota (Port Republic, Virginia)|Bogota]]" in Augusta County (present-day [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]] near the modern [[unincorporated community]] of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]]).<ref name = "Waddell10">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=481.}}</ref><ref name = "Loth1">{{Harvnb|Loth|2008|p=9.}}</ref> From 1754 to 1755, Jones served alongside a Mr. Parker representing [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] in the House of Burgesses.<ref name = "Munske2">{{Harvnb|Munske|2004|p=45.}}</ref><ref name = "Munske3">{{Harvnb|Munske|2004|p=47.}}</ref> Jones and Parker were Hampshire County's first representatives in the House of Burgesses following the county's creation on May 1, 1754.<ref name = "Munske2"/><ref name = "Munske3"/>

===Hampshire County Clerk of Court tenure===
In 1757, Jones was appointed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron to serve as the Clerk of Court for Hampshire County.<ref name = "Munske1"/>{{efn|name=first}}<ref name = "Maxwell1">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1897|p=363.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell4">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1897|p=278.}}</ref> Jones was on close terms with Lord Fairfax,<ref name = "Maxwell1"/> and [[George Rockingham Gilmer]] described Jones as a "kinsman, friend and executor of Lord Fairfax."<ref name = "Green1"/> Despite the county's establishment in 1754, it was not until 1757 that formal record keeping was actualized in Hampshire County.<ref name = "Munske1"/> According to [[historian]] Wilmer L. Kerns in ''Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754<U+2013>2004'' (2004), Jones was "well-organized" and had the "best [[penmanship]] of any clerk in the history of the county, in spite of being totally [[Blindness|blind]] in his right [[eye]]."<ref name = "Munske1"/> Historian [[Hu Maxwell]] described Jones's handwriting as "unmistakable" in his ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897).<ref name = "Maxwell1"/> 

Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of [[Richmond County, Virginia|Richmond County]] to serve as his deputy clerk.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, occasionally performing duties as acting clerk.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, it is likely that Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1897|p=364.}}</ref> According to Maxwell, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/>

While serving as Clerk of Court, Jones was again elected to serve as a member of the House of Burgesses representing Augusta County from 1757 until 1758<ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Waddell8">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=35.}}</ref> and Hampshire County from 1758 until 1761.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> It was during this period that Jones formed a close relationship with [[George Washington]], and the two regularly [[wikt:correspondence|corresponded]] with one another.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Jones was elected to serve a final term in the House of Burgesses representing Augusta County in 1771.<ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Waddell9">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=36.}}</ref> When Jones's "Bogota" estate became part of the newly-minted Rockingham County following its creation from Augusta County in 1778, Jones thus became a citizen of Rockingham and was summarily appointed as its [[Commonwealth's Attorney]].<ref name = "Waddell4"/> 

Jones served as the Clerk of Court for Hampshire County for a tenure spanning 25 years until his retirement from the position in 1782.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "Maxwell5">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1897|p=369.}}</ref> In his ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'', Maxwell theorizes that Jones retired from his position due in part to Lord Fairfax's death the previous year and waning British influence in Virginia toward the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name = "Maxwell2"/>

== Later life and legacy ==
Following his retirement from his position as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Jones continued to remain active in Virginia political affairs. In 1784, George Washington visited and dined with Jones at his home at "Bogota."<ref name = "Loth2"/> In 1788, Jones and his brother-in-law [[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Thomas Lewis]] were elected to represent Rockingham County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], where both were fervent proponents for the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name = "Waddell4"/>{{efn|name=election}} Archibald Stuart of neighboring Augusta County traveled to Rockingham to [[canvass]] for Jones prior to the election, and in return, Jones gifted Stuart a [[chaise]] for he and his wife to return home in to Augusta County.<ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones was among the first [[trustee]]s of the Staunton Academy, following its [[incorporation]] by an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] on December 4, 1792.<ref name = "Waddell7">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=203.}}</ref> 

Jones continued to practice law in Rockingham County until his death. The road he regularly traveled upon between his residence "Bogota" and Rockingham County's [[county seat|seat]] of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] became known as "The Lawyer's Road"<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/> which evolved to its present name of "Lawyer Road."<ref name = "Loth2"/> Because of his prominence throughout the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Valley of Virginia]] region, and partially due to the fact he was possibly the first lawyer in Augusta County, Jones was [[nickname]]d "''The'' Valley Lawyer."<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Green1"/>

Jones died at his estate "Bogata"<ref name = "Waddell4"/> in October 1806.<ref name = "Waddell5">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=394.}}</ref> 

In the Spring of 1887, a memorial window to Jones and his wife was installed in a new [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church erected near their former "Bogota" residence.<ref name = "Waddell5"/> Jones was further memorialized in historian Joseph Addison Waddell's ''Annals of Augusta County, Virginia'' (1886), in which he remarked of Jones:<ref name = "Waddell4"/>

== Personal life ==
Jones married on October 16, 1749<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> to Margaret Strother Morton (1726<U+2013>1822),<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> the [[widow]] of George Morton of of [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]]<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> and the daughter of William Strother<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> and his wife Margaret Watts of [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]].<ref name = "Green2"/> Jones's wife lived to be 97, and was described by Waddell in his ''Annals of Augusta County, Virginia'' as "a lady of eminent Christian character."<ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones and his wife Margaret had three daughters, one son, and a child of unknown sex that died in infancy:<ref name = "Waddell5"/>

*Margaret Morton Jones Harvie,<ref name = "Waddell5"/><ref name = "Green3">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=89.}}</ref> married lawyer Colonel [[John Harvie]] of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]]<ref name = "Waddell5"/><ref name = "Green3"/>

Jones was an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]].<ref name = "Munske1"/> As early as 1750, Jones used the same [[Crest (heraldry)|family crest]] and [[coat of arms]] as [[Philology|philologist]] [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], indicating a possible familial relationship between the two.<ref name = "Waddell1"/>

In his spare time during and between holding political appointments and serving in elected offices,<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Jones regularly embarked upon "pleasure trips" to various American cities including [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Another known [[hobby|pastime]] of Jones's was [[Gambling|gaming]].<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> According to Maxwell in his ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897), Jones had been gambling over the course of several days while in Richmond until a final game left him with only one [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] remaining in his pocketbook.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Jones was wearing a coat fastened with twelve gold buttons each valued at five dollars,<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> and undeterred, he began staking one gold button at a time until he was left with one.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Without hesitation, Jones removed his final button and remarked:<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> "Here goes the last button on Gabe's coat."<ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "Maxwell3">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1897|p=365.}}</ref> Maxwell states that Jones's remark "became a proverb in Hampshire County" and used when someone has been driven to extremes and utilized what little resources left at their disposal.<ref name = "Maxwell3"/>

== Physical description ==
Physically, Jones was of short [[Human height|stature]],<ref name = "Waddell5"/> and according to an extant contemporary [[portrait painting]] of him by artist [[John Drinker]], Jones sported a [[wig|periwig]] and an [[eyepatch]] over his right eye.<ref name = "Waddell5"/> According to Jones's descendants, it was supposed that his right eye was injured in his earlier years, while others attributed the loss of his right eye to an accident during his later years.<ref name = "Waddell5"/> In either case, Jones was completely blind in his right eye, and had suffered his injury prior to his tenure as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County in 1757.<ref name = "Munske1"/>

==Landholdings==
Jones settled in Frederick County and on March 1, 1747,<ref name = "Waddell1"/> he acquired a [[Land lot|tract of land]] along [[Opequon Creek]] near present-day [[Kernstown, Virginia|Kernstown]], where he resided for several years.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> On August 8, 1751, Jones acquired from Christopher Francisco of [[Pennsylvania]] {{convert|244|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} of land along the northern side of the [[Shenandoah River#South Fork Shenandoah River|South Fork Shenandoah River]] in Augusta County (later Rockingham County) near the present-day [[unincorporated community]] of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]].<ref name = "Waddell4"/> 

While still a resident in Frederick County, Jones purchased another {{convert|400|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} on the northern side of the [[James River]] in [[Botetourt County, Virginia|Botetourt County]].<ref name = "Waddell4"/> On December 3, 1753, Jones sold his property near Kernstown in Frederick County,<ref name = "Waddell4"/> and relocated to his tract of land along the Shenandoah River, on which he established his estate later known as "Bogota."<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell2"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Waddell10"/> Jones was the first to settle and construct a residence on his "Bogota" property upon his arrival in 1753,<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Loth1"/> and the estate received its name under Jones's occupancy. Jones continued to reside at "Bogata" until his death in 1806.<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/> 

Following Jones<U+2019>s death in 1806, his widow Margaret Morton Jones continued to reside at "Bogota" until her own death in 1822.<ref name = "Loth3"/> Jaquelin Harvie, the son of Jones's daughter Margaret Jones Harvie and her husband John Harvie, purchased the "Bogota" estate after the death of Jones's wife and Harvie subsequently sold the property in 1830 to Jacob Strayer, who built the current house in 1845<U+2013>1847.<ref name = "Loth3"/> The original house erected and occupied by Jones was demolished shortly after the construction of a new residence at "Bogota."<ref name = "Loth2"/> The site of Jones's house is presently located on property no longer part of the "Bogota" estate, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 25, 2009.<ref name = "Loth2"/> A log tenant house estimated to have been built during the mid-18th-century during the ownership of the Jones family is extant,<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Loth3">{{Harvnb|Loth|2008|p=12.}}</ref> and remains part of the current "Bogota" estate, as of 2008.<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Loth3"/>
