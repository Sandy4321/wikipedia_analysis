'''USS Joseph Hewes (AP-50)''' was a [[Joseph Hewes class transport|''Joseph Hewes''-class]] [[transport]]. She was built in [[1930]], acquired [[8 January]] [[1942]], by the [[U.S. Navy]] for use in [[World War II]], and was assigned the task of transporting troops to and from battle areas. She was sunk by a German torpedo along the North African coast.

''Joseph Hewes'', formerly Excalibur, was built in [[1930]] by the [[New York Shipbuilding]] Co., [[Camden, New Jersey]]; acquired by the Navy [[8 January]] [[1942]]; and commissioned [[1 May]] [[1942]], Captain Robert McL. Smith in command. 

== World War II North Atlantic operations ==

After conversion and fitting out, ''Joseph Hewes'' sortied from [[Hampton Roads]] [[24 October]] with the Center Attack Group of Admiral Hewitt's Western Naval Task Force en route to [[French Morocco]]. She was carrying 80 officers and 1,074 men of the reinforced 3rd Division, U.S. Army, plus vehicles and supplies. 

== North Africa operations ==

The transport arrived off [[Fedhala]] [[8 November]], by 0705 landed all troops, and then commenced unloading ammunition and supplies. By [[11 November]] ''Joseph Hewes'' had completed unloading and had received 30 casualties from the beach. 

== Struck by a torpedo ==

At 1950 she took a [[torpedo]] hit in No. 2 hold from [[U-173]]. The transport settled by the bow and began filling rapidly with water. Captain Smith endeavored to pick up anchor or slip chain but, as the entire [[forecastle]] was under water, this was not possible. He then attempted to beach the ship by backing engines but her [[propeller]] was out of the water, so the order was given to abandon ship. 

== Abandon ship! ==

''Joseph Hewes'' went down at 2032, taking Captain Smith and several seamen with her. By his coolness, calmness, and his devotion to duty in placing the safety of the crew and ship before his own, he instilled confidence in every officer and member of the crew. The U-173 paid heavily for her victory, for she was sunk 5 days later off [[Casablanca]] by American [[destroyers]].

== Military awards and honors ==
 
''Joseph Hewes'' received one [[battle star]] for [[World War II]] service.
