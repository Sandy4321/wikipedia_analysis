{{nihongo|'''Ai no Shuku'''|<U+9593><U+306E><U+5BBF>|mid-station}} were unofficial post stations along historical [[kaid<U+014D>|routes]] in [[Japan]]. These post stations formed organically along routes (such as the [[Nakasend<U+014D>]]) when the distance between two places was too far or when there were difficult passes nearby. Because they were not officially allowed to exist, travelers along the roads were not allowed to stay in these post stations. Sometimes the Japanese is shortened to <U+9593><U+5BBF>.
