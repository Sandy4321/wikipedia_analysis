'''Nedward "Ned" Flanders''' is a recurring [[fictional character|character]] in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], and first appeared in the series premiere "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]". He is the next door neighbor to the [[Simpson family]] and is generally loathed by [[Homer Simpson]]. A devout [[Christian]], he is amongst the most friendly and compassionate Springfieldians and is generally considered a pillar of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield community]].

He was one of the first characters outside of the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and he has since been central to several episodes, the first being [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]]'s "[[Dead Putting Society]]".

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
[[Image:Flanders with Parents.png|left|thumb|200px|A young Ned seen with his beatnik parents.]]
Ned Flanders, full name Nedward, born 1947, <ref>{{cite episode |title=I'm Goin' to Praiseland|episodelink=I'm Goin' to Praiseland |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Thacker, Julie; Sheetz, Chuck|network=Fox |airdate=2001-05-06 |season=12c|number=19}}</ref> is a genuinely well-meaning good-natured person and is one of the few in Springfield who can make that claim. Though firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a devout [[Christian denomination|Christian]] and strictly follows the [[Bible]] as literally as possible and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. This has led to his frequent calls to [[Reverend Lovejoy]], who has become increasingly frustrated and disinterested with Flanders.<ref name="Trust">{{cite episode |title=In Marge We Trust|episodelink=In Marge We Trust |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cary, Donick; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=1997-04-27 |season=08 |number=22}}</ref> Flanders grew up in New York City and was the son of "freaky beatniks" who did not discipline Ned and let him run wild. Eventually they took him to Dr. Foster, a psychiatrist, who put the young Ned through the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol, which involved eight months of continuous spanking. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper, causing Ned to unknowingly repress his anger.<ref name="Hurricane">{{cite episode |title=Hurricane Neddy|episodelink=Hurricane Neddy |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Young, Steve; Anderson, Bob|network=Fox |airdate=1996-12-29 |season=08 |number=08}}</ref> Flanders worked as a salesperson in the [[pharmaceuticals]] industry for the bulk of his adult life. Having saved much of his earnings, Flanders decided quit his job and invested his family's life savings into a store in the Springfield [[shopping mall|mall]] called ''The Leftorium'' specializing in  products for [[left-handed]] people.<ref name="Failed">{{cite episode |title=When Flanders Failed|episodelink=When Flanders Failed|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-03 |season=03 |number=03}}</ref> Despite a meek outward appearance, Ned hides an exceptionally well-built physique.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Streetcar Named Marge|episodelink=A Streetcar Named Marge|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Moore, Jeff|network=Fox |airdate=1992-10-01 |season=04 |number=02}}</ref> He is in his early 60s and Ned claims his deceptively youthful appearance is due to his conformity to the "clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church!"<ref name="Viva">{{cite episode |title=Viva Ned Flanders|episodelink=Viva Ned Flanders|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Stern, David M.; Affleck, Neil|network=Fox |airdate=1999-01-10 |season=10 |number=10}}</ref>

Ned is usually honest and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness and compassion. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over. He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance.<ref name="Lover">{{cite episode |title=Bart the Lover|episodelink=Bart the Lover|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Baeza, Carlos|network=Fox |airdate=1992-02-13 |season=03 |number=16}}</ref> Ned<U+2019>s dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a [[George Bailey]]-esque bailout with the help of many people in Springfield.<ref name="Failed"/> Despite his usual kindness, he has shown occasional antipathy toward [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Hindu]]ism;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Midnight Rx|episodelink=Midnight Rx|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Kruse, Nancy|network=Fox |airdate=2005-01-16 |season=16 |number=06}}</ref> has participated in "the walk for the cure for homosexuality";<ref>{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XIV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XIV|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=2003-11-02 |season=15 |number=01}}</ref> and on one occasion he discovered that Bart and Lisa Simpson were not baptized and immediately took it upon himself to baptize them.<ref name=Homediddly/>

Flanders is married to the equally religious Maude. They had two children together; the sheltered and na<U+00EF>ve [[Rod and Todd Flanders|Rod and Todd]].

In the early years of the ''The Simpsons'', [[Homer Simpson]] generally loathed Ned, because of Ned's family, job, health and self-discipline are of higher quality than he could ever hope to attain himself.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Dead Putting Society|episodelink=Dead Putting Society|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Moore, Rich|network=Fox |airdate=2003-03-02 |season=02 |number=06}}</ref> Homer has since come to have a love-hate relationship with Flanders, sometimes being his best friend, and other times treating Flanders with complete disregard.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Loves Flanders|episodelink=Homer Loves Flanders|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Richardson, David; Archer, Wes|network=Fox |airdate=1994-03-17 |season=05 |number=16}}</ref> Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing.<ref name="Alone"/> An early running joke was that [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] considers Flanders to be a perfect neighbor<ref name="Failed"/> and usually sides with him instead of her husband, which always enrages Homer.<ref name="JeanBtL"/>

==Character==
===Creation===
Ned Flanders, as well as his son Todd first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]] episode "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", which was the series premiere. The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]]'s "[[Dead Putting Society]]", which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders.<ref name="JeanDPS">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Dead Putting Society"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Flanders was named after Flanders St. in [[Portland, Oregon]], the hometown of ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]].<ref name="Portland">{{cite news | title=Painting the town in Portland | date=[[2007-01-06]] | last=Blake | first=Joseph | publisher=The Vancouver Sun | url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/travel/story.html?id=f90268d8-6a5b-438d-9509-f03ecff27cc1 | accessmonthday=[[January 13]] | accessyear=[[2007]]}}</ref> Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as "just a guy who was truly nice, that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe, but then did." It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful [[Christian]].<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|accessdate=2007-08-15|date=[[2000-10-21]]|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|author=Joe Rhodes}}</ref> [[Mike Scully]] noted that Flanders is "everything Homer would love to be, although he'll never admit it."<ref name=tvguide/> Flanders had been meant to just be a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used "such a sweet voice" and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer.<ref name="JeanWFF"/> Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering, and his first use of the word "doodly" was in "[[The Call of the Simpsons]]".<ref name="JeanCotS">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "The Call of The Simpsons"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> 

===Development===
[[Image:Theleftorium.png|thumb|180px|right| [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] visiting The Leftorium.]] 
Ned Flanders wasn't religious in his first few appearances and even in the first few seasons he was only mildly religious and his primary role was to be so "cloyingly perfect as to annoy and shame the Simpsons".<ref name="Turner">{{cite book| last = Turner| first = Chris| title =[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]]| page =pp. 270-271| id = ISBN 0-679-31318-4}}</ref> There has been a consistent effort among the shows writers to not just make him "goody good and an unsympathetic person".<ref name="JeanDPS"/> In the later seasons, Flanders has become more of a caricature of the [[Christian right]], and his role as an irritating "perfect neighbor" has been lessened.<ref name="Turner"/>

Ned's store "the Leftorium" first appeared in "[[When Flanders Failed]]".<ref name="JeanWFF">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> It was suggested by [[George Meyer]],<ref name="ReissWFF">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> who had had a friend who had owned a left handed specialty store which had failed.<ref name="VittiWFF">{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode "[[Hurricane Neddy]]" shows Ned's faith being tested and the writers also used the episode as a chance to examine what makes him tick.<ref name="WeinsteinHN">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  

There have been two occasions where Flanders was not voiced by Harry Shearer. In "[[Bart of Darkness]]", Flanders's high pitched scream was performed by [[Tress MacNeille]]<ref name=Groening>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Bart of Darkness"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and in "[[Homer to the Max]]", Flanders comments about cartoons being able to easily change voice actors and on that occasion he was voiced by [[Karl Wiedergott]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page12.shtml|title=Homer to the Max|accessdate=2007-10-31|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

=== "The Adventures of Ned Flanders" ===
''The Adventures of Ned Flanders'' was a short that appeared at the end of the episode "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]". Entitled ''Love that God'', it highlights the Flanders' dedication to religion and perfect family niceness. Ned nearly scolds Rod and Todd after they refuse to get ready for church &mdash; only to be told that it is, in fact, a Saturday. Ned laughs at his mistake with a trademark "okelydokely-doo!"<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Front|episodelink=The Front (The Simpsons)|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Lapidus, Adam I.; Moore, Rich|network=Fox |airdate=1993-04-15 |season=04 |number=19}}</ref> The short was added to the episode because it was so short and they had tried "every trick in the book" to lengthen the episode, so in desperation they added it.<ref name="ReissTF">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Front"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Although the episode was scripted by Adam I.

As a result, Oakley and Weinstein decided to produce an entire episode that was nothing but shorts that were loosely tied together, and it became the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] episode "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]".<ref name="Oakley22">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The Flanders/Lovejoy segment of that episode was written by [[David X.

==Reception==
Ned's "unbearable piousness" has been described as "''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> sharpest critique of organized religion. The show's implicit argument seems to be that humourless obsessives like Ned have hijacked religious institutions, removing them from the centre of society to a place where only those who know their brides of Beth Chedruharazzeb from their wells of Zohassadar can seek solace."<ref name="Turner"/> Although Flanders was meant to be a caricature of the [[Christian right]], he has since become a favorite of many conservative Christian viewers.<ref name="JeanDPS"/> He has been described as "[The United States]' most well-known evangelical."<ref name="US Catholic"/> It has been said that "today on American college and high school campuses, the name most associated with the word Christian<U+2014>other than Jesus<U+2014>is not the [[Pope]] or [[Mother Teresa]] or even [[Billy Graham]]. Instead, it's a goofy-looking guy named Ned Flanders on the animated sitcom known as The Simpsons. The mustache, thick glasses, green sweater, and irrepressibly cheerful demeanor of Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's next-door neighbor, have made him an indelible figure, the evangelical known most intimately to nonevangelicals".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/february5/1.28.html|title=Blessed Ned of Springfield|accessdate=2007-11-03|date=[[2001-02-05]]|author=Mark I.

==Cultural influence==
In 2001 and 2002, the [[Greenbelt festival]], a British Christian music and arts fest, held a special "Ned Flanders Night". The 2001 event featured a look-alike contest, as well as the tribute band "Ned Zeppelin". It was held in a 500 seat venue that was filled to capacity, and an extra 1500 people were turned away at the door.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://shipoffools.com/Cargo/Features01/NedNight/NedReport.html|title=Ned Flanders Night fandiddlerific!|accessdate=2007-11-03|date=[[2001]]|author=Steve Tomkins|publisher=[[Ship of Fools (website)|Ship of Fools]]}}</ref> A second event was held in 2002, with Ned Zeppelin reappearing.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2175870.stm|title=How Ned Flanders became a role model|accessdate=2007-11-03|date=[[2002-08-06]]|author=Giles Wilson |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>
