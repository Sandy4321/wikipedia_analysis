Tsao's family traces their roots back to [[Guangxi]] province.<ref name="RTHK">{{citation|title=Speaking Better English|periodical=Radio Television Hong Kong|date=2001-11-06|accessdate=2009-04-07|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/elearning/betterenglish/speech_mail.htm}}</ref> His father was the vice chief editor of ''[[Ta Kung Pao]],'' a [[leftwing]] newspaper in [[Hong Kong]], whilst his mother was also an editor of the same paper. His maternal grandfather was a journalist of the ''[[Pearl River Daily]]''. He was raised in Hong Kong's [[Wanchai]] district, and began reading early in his life. To attended [[Pui Kiu Middle School]] and later [[Lingnan Secondary School]] in Hong Kong. During this time, his writing was once published in ''[[The New Evening Post]]''. He obtained a Diploma in International Relations from the [[London School of Economics]] and in 1980 a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English and European Literature from the [[University of Warwick]].<ref>{{Citation|author=Warwick Graduates Association|title=Warwick Whereabouts: University of Warwick Alumni Directory|year=1999|page=938}}</ref> However, he states that he never thought about becoming a writer in his youth, and that his parents discouraged him from this career because they felt it would be dangerous.<ref name="ChinaDaily"/>

Tsao is married and has two children. He enjoys reading [[Chinese poetry]] to his children.<ref name="ChinaDaily"/> However, Hong Kong media have reported on his alleged [[infidelity]] to his wife. The proprietor of an [[hourly motel]] in [[Kowloon Tong]] claims Tsao is a regular customer there, and in 2004, a reporter for ''[[East Week]]'' tailed Tsao and an unidentified young woman to said hotel and took pictures of them. Tsao reportedly attempted to flee the scene with his head wrapped in toilet paper to obscure his face while the woman stood in front of the reporter's car to block pursuit.<ref>{{citation|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2004/08/25/HK0408250011.htm|periodical=Wen Wei Po|date=2004-08-25|accessdate=2009-04-07|title=<U+9676><U+5091><U+6D89><U+300C><U+5077><U+98DF><U+300D><U+88AB><U+8A18><U+8005><U+8E22><U+7206>/To Kit cheating; revealed by reporter}}</ref><ref>{{citation|periodical=Ta Kung Pao|url=http://www.zaobao.com/special/newspapers/2004/08/takungpao250804.html|date=2004-08-25|title=<U+9999><U+6E2F><U+300C><U+624D><U+5B50><U+300D><U+9676><U+6770><U+5077><U+6B22> <U+5395><U+7EB8><U+626E><U+6728><U+4E43><U+4F0A><U+906E><U+4E11>/Hong Kong "Man of Letters" To Kit cheating; wraps himself in toilet paper like a mummy to hide his shame|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>

==Career==
Tsao began his journalism career in the United Kingdom as a reporter for the [[BBC]] and [[Radio Television Hong Kong]].<ref name="RTHK"/> Then, famous writer [[Jin Yong]] (Louis Cha) invited him to write a regular column for ''[[Ming Pao]]'' about his experiences living abroad. It was at this time that he began to use his pen name To Kit.<ref name="ChinaDaily"/> The name of his column in Ming Pao, 'The Golden Venture' ({{lang|zh-hk|<U+9EC3><U+91D1><U+5192><U+96AA><U+865F>}}) (a.k.a. {{lang|zh-hk|<U+91D1><U+8272><U+5192><U+96AA><U+865F>}} by the [[China|Chinese]] press), derives from the [[Golden Venture|name of a vessel]] that took [[China|Chinese]] [[illegal immigrants]] to the [[United States]] in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} His first book, ''Alongside Thames'', was published in 1995.<ref name="ChinaDaily"/>

Tsao later he joined a team of [[Presenter|broadcasters]] to host a weekly [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme on [[RTHK]] named 'Free as Wind' ({{lang|zh-hk|<U+8B1B><U+6771><U+8B1B><U+897F>}}). In September 2003, he switched to the [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] to host a similar daily radio entitled 'Summit' ({{lang|zh-hk|<U+5149><U+660E><U+9802>}}, [[literal translation|literally]] 'the Peak of Light').{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Tsao currently writes for [[Apple Daily]] and [[HK Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Tsao is not without his controversies. His status as the premier writer of Hong Kong is often challenged, one example being a piece by Rosetta Lui and Perry Lam in the December 2007 issue of [[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|''Muse'']]: "Some 15 or 20 years from now, the books of Chip Tsao... if they are talked about at all, will most probably be used as anecdotal evidence to illustrate how dumbed-down our city's culture has become since the 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty. His essays are always funny, sometimes lyrical but almost never ruminative."<ref>{{Citation |last= Lui |first= Rosetta |coauthors= Lam, Perry |year= 2007 |month= 12 |title= The writer we deserve? |journal= Muse Magazine |issue= 11 |pages= 96 }}</ref>

==Political viewpoints==

===Hong Kong politics===
Tsao first began writing about Hong Kong public affairs in a column for English-language newspaper ''[[Eastern Express]]''. He is often perceived as pro-British, and has been accused of looking down on China.<ref name="ChinaDaily"/>

===Accusations of racism===
Tsao has faced various accusations of racism for his English-language writings. In October 2005, an article he wrote for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' entitled "Have Hong Kong girls stopped looking for Mr White?", sparked accusations that he promoted discrimination and was jealous of white men in Hong Kong. Tsao responded that he was merely being sarcastic and provocative, repeating themes which were often discussed in Chinese media, and accused his critics themselves of being racist and lacking the ability to "read between the lines".<ref>{{citation|periodical=South China Morning Post|last=Law|first=Niki|title=Outraged readers round on writer for 'racist dogma'|date=2005-10-16|accessdate=2009-04-01|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=31608}}</ref> 

On March 27, 2009, an article of Tsao's entitled "The War at Home" was published in the free ''[[HK Magazine]]''.<ref>{{citation|archiveurl=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=454117&publicationSubCategoryId=202|archivedate=2009-04-01|date=2009-03-27|last=Tsao|first=Chip|title=The War at Home|periodical=HK Magazine|accessdate=2009-04-01|url=http://hk-magazine.com/feature/war-home}}</ref> In it, he wrote that the Philippines was unworthy of claiming the [[Spratly Islands]] from China because "as a nation of servants, you don't flex your muscles at your master, from whom you earn most of your bread and butter."<ref>{{citation|periodical=GMANews.tv|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/154686/HK-scribe-hit-for-calling-RP-nation-of-servants|accessdate=2009-04-01|date=2009-03-29|title=HK scribe hit for calling RP 'nation of servants'}}</ref> Many Filipinos decried his article as racist, discriminatory, and demeaning, and the Philippine government declared him an "[[persona non grata|undesirable alien]]" as a result.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/pinoy-migration/03/31/09/rp-consulate-hong-kong-finds-luisa|periodical=ABS-CBN News|title=RP Consulate in Hong Kong finds 'Luisa'|date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2009-04-01|last=Nubia|first=Timi}}</ref> His writings provoked negative reactions from various Philippine legislators; [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Pia Cayetano]] stated that "instead of contributing to intelligent discussions on ways to resolve the Spratlys dispute, Tsao only succeeded in eliciting hatred and sowing more confusion not only among Filipinos but maybe even among his fellow Chinese who are not aware of the intricacies of the issue", while [[Para<U+00F1>aque]] [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] [[Roilo Golez]] refused to accept Tsao's apology for his article, and challenged him to a boxing match.<ref>{{citation|title=Lawmaker dares Chip Tsao to 1 round of boxing|last=Sisante|first=Johanna Camille|date=2009-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|periodical=GMANews.tv|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/155071/Lawmaker-dares-Chip-Tsao-to-1-round-of-boxing}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2009/0329_cayetano1.asp|publisher=Senate of the Philippines, 14th Congress|date=2009-03-29|accessdate=2009-04-08|chapter=Pia slams Chip Tsao, HK Magazine|title=Press release}}</ref> On March 30, 2009, HK Magazine issued an apology for the offense Tsao's article had caused.<ref>{{citation|periodical=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090330-197052/HK-magazine-regrets-columnists-racial-slur|date=2009-03-30|last=Aning|first=Jerome|title=HK magazine regrets columnist's racial slur|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref> The following day, Tsao subsequently admitted his wrongdoing and apologized to the Philippine government and its people in an interview aired over Hong Kong<U+2019>s ATV. He said, "I realized that I had crossed the line. I now offer my public apology." He has also indicated, however, that the article was meant as satire, and that it "was never intended to be insulting to the Filipino domestic workers."<ref>{{citation|periodical=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/news/view/20090401-197404/HK-writer-So-sorry-I-crossed-the-line|date=2009-04-01|last=Balana|first=Cynthia|title=HK writer: 'So sorry, I crossed the line'|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>
