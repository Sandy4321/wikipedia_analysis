==High School==
Mendoza, a graduate of [[Adolfo Camarillo High School]], was named [[Los Angeles Times]] "Player of the Year" in 1998.  During her junior and senior year, she was named Camarillo High School "Female Athlete of the Year." Mendoza was also a member of the high school [[basket ball]] team and was the team MVP in both her junior and senior years.<ref>http://www.gostanford.com/sports/w-softbl/mtt/mendoza_jessica00.html</ref>

==Stanford Cardinal==
Mendoza began her career as a 1999 First Team [[All-American]] and All-[[Pac 10]] honoree.<ref>http://nfca.org/awards_test/index.php?winner_page=789</ref> Included with her recognition, she was named conference "Newcomer of The Year." She broke the Cardinal records for season batting average and RBI totals while ranking top-10 for her hits.

On March 6 in defeating the [[Illinois State Redbirds]], Mendoza hit a single game career high 4 hits off pitchers Corey Harris, Tammy Millian and Jamie Bagnall.<ref>http://www.gostanford.com/sports/w-softbl/stats/030999aac.html</ref> Later that month, for the week of March 8, she was named National Fastpitch Coaches Association "Player of The Week" after hitting .631 (12/19) with 11 RBIs, 4 home runs, a triple and two doubles for a slugging percentage of 1.473%.<ref>http://www.gostanford.com/sports/w-softbl/spec-rel/031199aaa.html</ref>

The sophomore's season saw her again earn First Team citations for the [[NCAA Division I]] and the [[Pac 10]].<ref>http://nfca.org/awards_test/index.php?winner_page=298</ref> She added conference "Player of The Year" to her collection and broke her own record for batting average with a then school and career best .474 statistic, which also led the [[NCAA]].<ref>http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/Softball%20Archived%20Stats/2000/D1.txt</ref> She also claimed new records for hits, home runs, doubles, slugging and stolen bases, which all still rank top-10 for a season at [[Stanford]].<ref>http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/54f559e2#/54f559e2/1</ref>

February 19 through March 22, 2000, Mendoza went on a school record 20 consecutive game hit streak. She batted .561 (32/57) to accompany 15 RBIs, 4 home runs, doubles and walks, striking out just once with a slugging of .842%.

Mendoza continued her success for the Cardinal with her third [[All-American]] and All-[[Pac 10]] citations.<ref>http://nfca.org/awards_test/index.php?winner_page=248</ref> She posted top-10 season records in virtually every category, still currently ranking second in home runs and stolen bases.<ref>http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/54f559e2#/54f559e2/1</ref>

It was her only appearance at the series.

For a final season, Mendoza earned First Team citations for both conference and the [[NCAA]].<ref>http://nfca.org/awards_test/index.php?winner_page=186</ref> With her fourth straight honor from the [[NCAA]], Mendoza joined elite company as only the fifth player to accomplish the feat then.
