{{dablink|This article is about the Pacific hurricane of 2001; for other storms of the same name, see [[Hurricane Adolph]].}}
'''Hurricane Adolph (2001)''' was the first depression, tropical storm, hurricane, and major hurricane of the [[2001 Pacific hurricane season]]. When this storm formed, it became only the second time that two consecutive East Pacific hurricane seasons ([[2000 Pacific hurricane season|2000]]-[[2001 Pacific hurricane season|01]]) had named storms develop in May since hurricane records began in the basin ([[1983 Pacific hurricane season|1983]]-[[1984 Pacific hurricane season|84]] was the first). After [[rapid intensification|rapidly intensifying]], Adolph became the most powerful storm in terms of wind speed this season, along with [[Hurricane Juliette (2001)|Hurricane Juliette]].<ref name="2001 Pacific hurricane season summary">{{cite web|author=Franklin, Avila, Beven, Lawrence, Pasch, and Stewart|year=2001|title=2001 Pacific Hurricane Season Summary|accessdate=2007-02-14|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/tws/MIATWSEP_nov.html}}</ref> Despite only briefly threatening land, the name was later removed from use.

Adolph was noteworthy for being the first and so far the only East Pacific hurricane in May to reach Category 4 strength since record keeping began in the East Pacific and for the reasons behind the name's eventual removal.<ref name="Padgett May 01 Report">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2001|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary for May 01|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/may01.txt}}</ref>

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Adolph 2001 track.png}}
On [[May 7]], a tropical wave left the coast of [[Africa]]. The wave moved across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] without showing little signs of development until [[May 18]], when a low pressure center began organizing along the wave over [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]]. The low entered the [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[May 22]], and [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began two days later. At first the system was disorganized, but [[convection]] quickly concentrated near the center, and on [[May 25]] the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression 1-E while located about 250 miles south-southwest of [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]].<ref name="Adolph TCR">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

A banding [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] feature became apparent on satellite imagery. Convection around the eye deepened while the eye became more pronounced, and Adolph was upgraded to hurricane strength on May 27. On [[May 28]] the hurricane passed within roughly 165 miles of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coastline the next day, its closest approach to land. Shortly thereafter, Adolph turned westward under the influence of a mid-tropospheric [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]].<ref name="Adolph TCR">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

When Adolph reached Category 4 strength on [[May 29]], it became the strongest hurricane to form in the East Pacific basin in May. Coincidentally, the previous record holder for strongest May hurricane, in [[1983 Pacific hurricane season|1983]] with 110 mph winds, was also named "Adolph".<ref name="Padgett May 01 Report">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2001|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary for May 01|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/may01.txt}}</ref> Adolph also became the only May hurricane to reach Category 3 and 4 strength.<ref name="Adolph TCR">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

Despite never having made landfall as well as no reported damages anywhere, the name Adolph was removed from the list of hurricane names after this season for political reasons. The given reason is that the name was retired because of connections to [[Adolf Hitler]]. The name submitted to replace Adolph is '''Alvin'''.

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] received intense criticism for using both '''Adolph''' and '''Israel''' during the season, mostly from Jewish leaders who called the use of the names "bizarre", "stupid", and "insensitive".<ref name="chretiens et juifs">{{cite web|author=Elli Wohlgelernter|year=2001|title=Storm Brewing Over Hurricane Named Israel|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://www.chretiens-et-juifs.org/article.php?voir%5B%5D=1372&voir%5B%5D=3865}}</ref> In fact, the President of the WMO Regional Association IV-which monitors this basin-consulted committee members during the season and removed Israel as a consensus, but because Adolph had already been used for this storm, the removal of the name had to wait until the 24th Session of the WMO Committee that oversaw the basin.<ref name="WMO 24th Session Report">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2002|title=RA IV Hurricane Committee Final Report of the 24th Session|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Reports/HC-24FinalReport-ENG.pdf}}</ref>
