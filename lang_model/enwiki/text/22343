'''Dr. Jean Marie Malecki''' is an American [[public health]] official who was among the first medical doctors to deal with a [[bioterrorism]] attack in the United States.<ref name="Jean Malecki, M.D">[http://www.homelanddefensejournal.com/hdl/bio_malecki.asp Jean Malecki, M.D<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Dr. Malecki has been the Director of the [[Palm Beach County]] Health Department since 1991 and is the Chair of the Department of [[Preventive Medicine]] at [[Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine]].<ref>[http://www.pbchd.com/director/jean_malecki_achievements.html Jean Marie Malecki, M.D. Director- Achievements, Palm Beach County Health Department]</ref> 

During her tenure as the Palm Beach County Health Director, Malecki played a key role in responding to bioterrorism risks during the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] at [[American Media Inc|American Media]] in [[Boca Raton, Florida]]. On October 2, 2001, [[Robert Stevens (photo editor)|Robert Stephens]], photo editor for the supermarket tabloid publishing company, was admitted to [[JFK Medical Center]], where an initial diagnosis of possible anthrax was made by Dr. Larry Bush, his attending physician.  Multiple tests were rapidly conducted by county and state labs, and ultimately by the [[CDC]] in Atlanta; meanwhile, Mr. Stevens's condition worsened, and he died October 5.  On October 7, Dr. Malecki quarantined the company's building following this suspicious death, citing anthrax as the cause even though some federal and state officials disagreed.  Malecki helped start a Healthy Care program, where nurses provide in-home counseling to pregnant women and continued health guidance after the birth. She also helped create a Comprehensive AIDS Program, which provides clinical care, dental care and housing assistance to people with HIV/AIDS.<ref>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/health/sfl-flpmalecki0304pnmar04,0,899372.story Palm Beach County health director to step down]</ref>

Malecki has received numerous awards in recognition of her contributions to the fields of [[public health]] and [[preventive medicine]].  In 2004, Malecki was recognized as Changing the Face of Medicine and honored as a Local Legend by the [[National Library of Medicine]], [[American Medical Women's Association]] and United States Representative [[Robert Wexler]] (D-FL).<ref>[http://www.pbchd.com/press/2004/feb/febnews12004.html Palm Beach County Health Department, Press Release]</ref>.  The National Library of Medicine added Malecki to its Changing the Face of Medicine: Celebrating America<U+2019>s Women Physicians exhibit at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.
