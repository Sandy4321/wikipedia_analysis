'''Pearl Roundabout''' or '''Lulu Roundabout''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{rtl-lang|ar|<U+062F><U+0648><U+0627><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0644><U+0624><U+0644><U+0624>(<U+0629>)}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Daww<U+0101>r al-lu<U+02BE>lu<U+02BE>(ah)}}'', "Roundabout of the pearl(s)") was a roundabout located near the [[Central business district|financial district]] of [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]]. The [[roundabout]] was named after the [[pearl]] monument that previously stood on the site and was destroyed on March 18, 2011 by government forces as part of a crackdown on protesters during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)]].<ref name=yalibnan/>

==Location==
The roundabout was located in the heart of the capital Manama and was surrounded by the Bahrain Central Market, Marina, Pearl and City Center Roundabout<ref name = "Al Wasat">{{citation | publisher = Al Wasat | journal = News | url = http://www.alwasatnews.com/3116/news/read/532856/1.html}}</ref> as well the [[Abraj Al Lulu]] (Pearl Towers) apartment complex, which is named after the Pearl Monument. Also near the destroyed roundabout are some of the city's major remaining landmarks, including the [[Bahrain World Trade Center]] and the [[Bahrain Financial Harbour]].

The roundabout served originally as a major traffic intersection for routes into the capital city, although it is now bypassed by a flyover and junction complex built as part of Bahrain's 2030 modernization plan.<ref name=yalibnan>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Second Man Dies in Bahrain Skirmishes|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2011/02/15/second-man-dies-in-bahrain-skirmishes/|work=[[Ya Libnan]] |publisher=|date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref>

==Pearl Monument==
The Pearl Monument previously stood in the center of the circle,<ref name=yalibnan/> having been erected in 1982 on the occasion of the third summit of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], which was hosted by Bahrain for the first time in Manama on November 9<U+2013>11 of that year.<ref name = "Al Wasat"/><ref name=haaretz/><ref>[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/timeline-of-the-gcc-summit-1.723199 Timeline of the GCC Summit], gulfnews.com, Dec. 10, 2010</ref>

===Symbols and representation===
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Bahrain coin 500Fils.JPG|thumb|The Pearl Monument depicted on a [[Bahraini dinar|500 fils coin]] in Bahrain]] -->
The Pearl Monument consisted of six [[dhow]] "sails" projecting up to the sky, which came together to hold a [[pearl]] at the top. The six sails designated the Gulf Cooperation Council's six member nations, while the pearl symbolized their united heritage and the country's famous history of pearl cultivation.<ref>[http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.home&id=75 Bahrain: Two Million Tourists Can't Be Wrong] April 17, 2007, Bahrain Embassy</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/bahrain/8390773/Bahrain-authorities-destroy-Pearl-Roundabout.html |title=Bahrain authorities destroy Pearl Roundabout |publisher=The Telegraph | location=London |first=Ben |last=Farmer |date=2011-03-18}}</ref> At the base of the monument was a [[dodecagon]]al pool with [[fountain]] jets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Pearl Monument is featured on the face of the Bahraini half-[[Bahraini dinar|dinar]] coin, the highest value coin in Bahraini currency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbb.gov.bh/page.php?p=current_coins_500fils |title=Current Coins: 500 fils |publisher=Central Bank of Bahrain}}</ref>  The [[Central Bank of Bahrain]] reportedly asked banks to exchange their half-dinar coins for half-dinar banknotes after the Pearl Monument was destroyed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3123/news/read/534225/1.html |script-title=ar:<U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0635><U+0631><U+0641> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0631><U+0643><U+0632><U+064A>" <U+064A><U+0633><U+062D><U+0628> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0640> 500 <U+0641><U+0644><U+0633> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0639><U+062F><U+0646><U+064A><U+0629>" |trans_title=Central Bank pulls 500 fils coins |language=Arabic |newspaper=[[Alwasat (Bahraini newspaper)|Alwasat]] | location=Manama |date=2011-03-26 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  The coin is no longer minted or distributed by the [[Central Bank of Bahrain]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=302685 |title=Collector's item |newspaper=[[Gulf Daily News]] |first=Alicia |last=De Haldevang |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>

On 15 February 2011, after the funeral procession of Mr [[Death of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima|Ali Mushaima]], more people joined the demonstrators and moved towards the Pearl Roundabout, where they arrived at around 15:00. By 15:15, demonstrators began to set up tents at the roundabout, and later in the day a projector screen was installed. Among these was a tent erected by members of the SMC medical staff. There were also a number of demonstrators obstructing traffic in the roundabout overpass. By nightfall, the number of demonstrators had reached several thousand. The roundabout and its immediate vicinity were congested with protesters and private vehicles. Police in the area neither engaged the demonstrators nor did they attempt to disperse them. King Hamad had ordered that members of the procession be allowed to occupy the Pearl Roundabout to express their sadness.<ref>http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf (p81)</ref>

On 17 February 2011, while demonstrators were spending the night at the Pearl Roundabout, police forces entered the location at 3:00 in an attempt to disperse protesters. The crackdown led to many injuries as well as the death of at least four civilians (See [[Bloody Thursday (2011)]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121714223324820.html |title=Clashes rock Bahraini capital - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref>

Soon after the police crackdown on demonstrators, Bahraini police official Al-Hassan appeared on national television to explain the previous night's events. Al-Hassan argued that demonstrators were warned beforehand and that they refused to leave the area. He also added that demonstrators were actually in possession of weapons such as knives and pistols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akhbaralarab.net/index.php/regional/33378-2011-02-17-15-17-04 |title=<U+0627><U+0644><U+062F><U+0627><U+062E><U+0644><U+064A><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+062D><U+0631><U+064A><U+0646><U+064A><U+0629> <U+062A><U+0639><U+0644><U+0646> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+062B><U+0648><U+0631> <U+0639><U+0644><U+0649> <U+0630><U+062E><U+064A><U+0631><U+0629> <U+062D><U+064A><U+0629> <U+0648><U+0633><U+064A><U+0648><U+0641> <U+0648><U+0633><U+0643><U+0627><U+0643><U+064A><U+0646> <U+0648><U+0627><U+0639><U+0644><U+0627><U+0645> <U+0644><U+062D><U+0632><U+0628> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0644><U+0647> <U+0641><U+064A> <U+062E><U+064A><U+0645> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+062A><U+062C><U+0645><U+0647><U+0631><U+064A><U+0646> |publisher=Akhbaralarab.net |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref>  The [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]], established by [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King Hamad]] of Bahrain to prepare a report on the events on February and March saw no evidence to suggest that protesters at the roundabout were armed.<ref name="bici">{{cite report |title=Report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry |publisher=[[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] |url=http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf |date=23 November 2011}}</ref>{{rp|page=231}}
