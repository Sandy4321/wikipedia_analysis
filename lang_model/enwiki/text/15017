'''Globalization''', or '''globalisation''', is the increasing [[interdependence]], integration and interaction among people and corporations in disparate locations around the world. It is an [[umbrella term]] which refers to a complex medley of [[Economics|economic]], trade, [[social]], [[technological]], [[cultural]] and [[political]] interrelationships. The term has been used as early as [[1944]], however [[Theodore Levitt]] is usually credited with its first use in an economic context.<ref>Levitt, Theodore. ''Globalization of markets'', Harvard Business Review, 1983</ref>

A typical - but restrictive - definition can be taken from the [[International Monetary Fund]], which stresses the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide through increasing volume and variety of cross-border transactions in goods and services, free international capital flows, and more rapid and widespread diffusion of [[technology]].While being a complex and multifaceted arraygay, globalization can be broken down into separate aspects:
* ''industrial'' globalization (alias ''trans nationalization'') - rise and expansion of [[multinational corporation|multinational enterprises]]
* ''financial'' globalization - emergence of worldwide financial markets and better access to external financing for corporate, national and subnational borrowers
* ''political'' globalization - spread of political sphere of interests to the regions and countries outside the neighborhood of political (state and non-state) actors
* ''informational'' globalization - increase in information flows between geographically remote locations
* ''cultural'' globalization - growth of cross-cultural contacts
* ''globalism'' - connection between cultures, nations, and people, it embodies cultural diffusion, the desire to consume and enjoy foreign products and ideas, adopt new technology and practices, and participate in a "world culture". It is a universal, internationalist impulse that the world is connected. 
* ''globalist'' - someone who is aware of world issues, enjoys new ideas, and considers themselves global citizens with an open mind to both criticize and agree with others. <ref>Gutsalo,Yevgeniy Globalization and Globalism: Teenagers and the future of culture, trade and technology.</ref>. 
===Economic definition===
According to Dr. [[Ismail Shariff]], globalization is the worldwide process of homogenizing prices, products, wages, rates of interest and profits <ref>Shariff,Ismail. GLOBAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION: PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS. From An International Journal of Development Economics. Development Review, Vol1, No.2 (2003): p. 163-178</ref>. Globalization relies on three forces for development: the role of human [[migration]], international [[trade]], and rapid movements of [[capital]] and integration of financial [[market]]s.

== Characteristics ==
Globalization/internationalization has become identified with a number of trends, most of which may have developed or accelerated since [[World War II]]. These include greater international movement of commodities, money, information, and people; and the development of technology, organizations, legal systems, and infrastructures to allow this movement. The actual existence of some of these trends is debated.{{fact}} 
* Greater international cultural exchange,
** Spreading of [[multiculturalism]], and better individual access to [[cultural diversity]], for example through the export of [[Hollywood]] and [[Bollywood]] movies. However, the imported culture can easily supplant the local culture, causing reduction in diversity through [[Cultural hybridization|hybridization]] or even [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. The most prominent form of this is [[Westernization]], but [[Sinicization]] of cultures also takes place.
** Greater international [[travel]] and [[tourism]]
** Greater [[immigration]], including [[illegal immigration]]
** Spread of local consumer products (e.g., food) to other countries (often adapted to their culture)
** World-wide fads and pop culture such as [[Pok<U+00E9>mon]], [[Sudoku]], [[Numa Numa]], [[Origami]], [[Idol series]], [[YouTube]], and [[MySpace]].
** World-wide sporting events such as [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Olympic Games]].
** Formation or development of a set of [[universal values]]
*Technical/legal
** Development of a [[global telecommunications infrastructure]] and greater transborder data flow, using such technologies as the [[Internet]], [[communication satellites]], [[Submarine communications cable|submarine fiber optic cable]], and [[Mobile phone|wireless telephones]]
** Increase in the number of standards applied globally; e.g. [[copyright law]]s and [[patent]]s
** The push by many advocates for an [[international criminal court]] and  [[International Court of Justice|international justice movements]]. 

===Positive and negative effects===
The term "globalization" is  used to refer to these collective changes as a process, or else as the cause of turbulent change. The distinct uses include:

* ''Economically, socially and ecologically positive:'' As an engine of [[commerce]]; one which brings an increased [[standard of living]] &mdash; [[prosperity]] &mdash; to [[Third World]] countries and further [[wealth]] to [[First World]] countries.

* ''Economically, socially,politically, and ecologically negative:'' As an engine of "[[corporate imperialism]];" one which tramples over [[human rights]] in developing societies, claims to bring prosperity, yet often simply amounts to [[looting|plundering]] and [[profiteering]]. Negative effects include [[cultural assimilation]] via [[cultural imperialism]], the export of artificial wants, and the destruction or inhibition of authentic local and global community, [[ecology]] and [[culture]]s.

It is often argued that even [[terrorism]] has undergone globalization, with attacks in foreign countries that have no direct relation with the attackers' own country.<ref>[http://globalization.about.com/od/greatarticles/a/gzterrorism.htm Keith Porter, ''"The Future of Terrorism"'']</ref><ref>[http://venus.ci.uw.edu.pl/~rubikon/forum/terrorism.htm Asta Maskaliunaite, ''"Terrorism and Globalization: Recent Debates"'']</ref>

Since World War II, barriers to international trade have been considerably lowered through international agreements [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). Particular initiatives carried out as a result of GATT and the WTO, for which GATT is the foundation, have included:
* Promotion of free trade
** Of goods:
*** Reduction or elimination of [[tariff]]s; construction of [[free trade zone]]s with small or no tariffs
*** Reduced transportation costs, especially from development of [[containerization]] for ocean shipping.
** Of [[capital (economics)|capital]]: reduction or elimination of [[capital controls]]
** Reduction, elimination, or harmonization of [[subsidy|subsidies]] for local businesses
* [[Intellectual property]] restrictions
** Harmonization of intellectual property laws across nations (generally speaking, with more restrictions)
** Supranational recognition of intellectual property restrictions (e.g. [[patent]]s granted by [[China]] would be recognized in the [[United States|US]])

== Historical precedents  ==
''See [[History of Globalization]].''

Although the term "globalization' was coined in the latter half of the twentieth century, and the term and its concepts did not permeate popular consciousness until the latter half of the 1980's; various social scientists have tried to demonstrate continuity between contemporary trends of globalization and earlier periods.{{fact}} Earlier forms of globalization existed during the [[Mongol Empire]], when there was greater integration along the [[Silk Road]]. 

The first steps towards globalization, as it is recognised today, were taken in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Portuguese and Spanish Empires reached to all corners of the world. The effects on European industries were notable, e.g. the Silver Mining in [[Schwaz]] in [[Austria]] was partly abandoned, as silver was available from the Spanish colonies for lower prices.
Globalization became a business phenomena in the 17th century when the first Multinational was founded in The Netherlands. During the [[Dutch Golden Age]] the [[Dutch East India Company]] was established as a private owned company. Because of the high risks involved with the international trade, ownership was divided with [[Shares]]. The Dutch East India Company was the first company in the world to issue shares, an important driver for globalization.

Liberalization in the [[19th century]] is often called "The First Era of Globalization", a period characterized by rapid growth in international trade and investment, between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and, later, the [[United States]].

The "First Era of Globalization" began to break down at the beginning with the first World War, and later collapsed during the [[gold standard|gold standard crisis]] in the late [[1920]]s and early [[1930]]s. Countries that engaged in that era of globalization, including the European core, some of the European periphery and various European American and Oceanic offshoots, prospered.{{fact}} Inequality between those states fell, as goods, capital and labour flowed freely between nations.

Globalization in the era since World War II has been driven by advances in technology which have reduced the costs of trade, and [[trade negotiation rounds]], originally under the auspices of [[GATT]], which led to a series of agreements to remove restrictions on free trade. The [[Uruguay]] round (1984 to 1995) led to a treaty to create the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), to mediate trade disputes and set up a uniform platform of trading. Other bi- and trilateral trade agreements, including sections of Europe's [[Maastricht Treaty]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) have also been signed in pursuit of the goal of reducing tariffs and barriers to trade.

The world increasingly is confronted by problems that can not be solved by individual nation-states acting alone. Examples include cross-boundary air and water [[pollution]], over-fishing of the oceans and other degradations of the [[natural environment]], regulation of outer-space, global warming, international terrorist networks, global trade and finance, and so on. Solutions to these problems necessitate new forms of cooperation and the creation of new global institutions. Since the end of WWII, following the advent of the [[UN]] and the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions, there has been an explosion in the reach and power of [[Multinational corporation]]s and the rapid growth of [[global civil society]].<ref> see Florini, A. 2000. ''The Third Force''. Tokyo: JCIE </ref>

The [[Global scenario group]], an environmental research and forecasting organization, views globalization as part of the shift to a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]], characterized by global social organizations, economies, and communications. The GSG maintains that the future character of this global society is uncertain and contested.

== Pro-globalization (globalism) ==

Supporters of [[democratic globalization]] are sometimes called pro-globalists.  They consider that the first phase of globalization, which was market-oriented, should be completed by a phase of building global political institutions representing the will of [[world citizen]]s. The difference with other globalists is that they do not define in advance any ideology to orient this will, which should be left to the free choice of those citizens via a democratic process {{fact}}.

Supporters of [[free trade]] point out that economic theories of [[comparative advantage]] suggest that free trade leads to a more efficient allocation of resources, with all countries involved in the trade benefiting. In general, this leads to lower prices, more employment and higher output.

[[Libertarians]] and other proponents of [[laissez-faire capitalism]] say higher degrees of political and economic freedom in the form of [[democracy]] and [[capitalism]] in the developed world are both ends in themselves and also produce higher levels of material wealth. They see globalization as the beneficial spread of liberty and capitalism.

Critics argue that the anti-globalization movement uses [[anecdotal evidence]] to support their view and that worldwide statistics instead strongly support globalization:

* The percentage of people in developing countries living below US $1 (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power) per day has halved in only twenty years,<ref>[http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp PovcalNet, iResearch.worldbank.org]</ref> although some critics argue that more detailed variables measuring poverty should instead be studied.<ref>[http://www.transnational.org/features/chossu_worldbank.html Michel Chossudovsky, ''"Global Falsehoods"'']</ref>

* [[Life expectancy]] has almost doubled in the developing world since [[World War II|WWII]] and is starting to close the gap to the developed world where the improvement has been smaller. [[Infant mortality]] has decreased in every developing region of the world.<ref>[http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=2429 Guy Pfefferman, ''"The Eight Losers of Globalization"'']</ref> [[Income inequality]] for the world as a whole is diminishing.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~xs23/papers/worldistribution/NYT_november_27.htm David Brooks, ''"Good News about Poverty"'']</ref>.

* Democracy has increased dramatically from almost no nation with [[universal suffrage]] in [[1900]] to 62.5% of all nations in [[2000]].<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/reports/century.html Freedom House]</ref>

* The proportion of the world's population living in countries where per-capita food supplies are less than 2,200 [[calorie]]s (9,200 [[kilojoule]]s) per day decreased from 56% in the mid-[[1960s]] to below 10% by the [[1990s]].<ref>[http://reason.com/news/show/34961.html BAILEY, R.(2005).</ref>

* Between [[1950]] and [[1999]], global literacy increased from 52% to 81% of the world. Women made up much of the gap: Female literacy as a percentage of male literacy has increased from 59% in [[1970]] to 80% in 2000.<ref>[http://reason.com/news/show/34961.html BAILEY, R.(2005). The poor may not be getting richer but they are living longer. ]</ref>

* The percentage of children in the labor force has fallen from 24% in 1960 to 10% in 2000. <ref>[http://www.oxfordleadership.com/DataFiles/homePage/Projects/OLA_Mexico%20_Award_Oct%2020_2006.pdf Oxford Leadership Academy.]</ref>

* There are similar increasing trends for electric power, cars, radios, and telephones per capita, as well as the proportion of the population with access to clean water.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VC6-4F02KWN-8&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=full&_orig=browse&_cdi=5946&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_artOutline=Y&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=273c9d354f2f52b3b14606a5a3b2d69f#bfn25 ScienceDirect]</ref>

However, some of these improvements may not be due to globalization, or may be possible without the current form of globalization or its perceived negative consequences, to which the global justice movement objects.

Some pro-capitalists {{fact}} are also critical of the World Bank and the IMF, arguing that they are corrupt bureaucracies controlled and financed by states, not corporations. Many loans have been given to dictators who never carried out promised reforms, instead leaving the common people to pay the debts later. They thus see too little capitalism, not too much. They {{fact}} also note that some of the resistance to globalization comes from special interest groups with conflicting interests, like Western world [[trade union|unions]]. [[Jos<U+00E9> Bov<U+00E9>]], one of the leaders of the movement, also represent French farmers, who are protected from competition from the developing world by high tariffs and recieve very large subsidies from the European Union.

Others, such as [[Canadian Senate|Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], simply view globalization as inevitable and advocate creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly-elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.

Supporters of globalization are highly critical of some current policies. In particular, the very high [[subsidies]] to and protective [[tariff]]s for [[agriculture]] in the developed world. For example, almost half of the budget of the [[European Union]] goes to agricultural subsidies, mainly to large farmers and agribusinesses, which form a powerful lobby.<ref>[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/downloads/bp31_dumping.pdf Oxfam:Stop the dumping!]</ref> Japan gave 47 billon dollars in 2005 in subsidies to its agricultural sector,<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/6/37002611.xls OECD Producer Support Estimate By Country]</ref> nearly four times the amount it gave in total foreign aid.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/59/5/37781218.pdf OECD Development Aid At a Glance By Region]</ref> The US gives 3.9 billon dollars each year in subsidies to its cotton sector, including 25,000 growers, three times more in subsidies than the entire USAID budget for Africa<U+2019>s 500 million people.<ref>[http://www.oxfam.org/en/files/pp020925_cotton.pdf/download Cultivating Poverty The Impact of US Cotton Subsidies on Africa]</ref> This drains the taxed money and increases the prices for the consumers in developed world; decreases competition and efficiency; prevents exports by more competitive agricultural and other sectors in the developed world due to retaliatory trade barriers; and undermines the very type of industry in which the developing countries do have comparative advantages.<ref>[http://www.reason.com/news/show/36207.html Six Reasons to Kill Farm Subsidies and Trade Barriers]</ref>

== Measurement of globalization ==

To what extent a nation-state or culture is globalized in a particular year has until most recently been measured employing simple proxies like flows of trade, migration, or foreign direct investment. A more sophisticated approach to measuring globalization is the recent index calculated by the Swiss [[Think tank]] [http://www.globalization-index.org/ KOF]. The index measures the three main dimensions of globalization: economic, social, and political. In addition to three indices measuring these dimensions, an overall index of globalization and sub-indices referring to actual economic flows, economic restrictions, data on personal contact, data on information flows, and data on cultural proximity is calculated. Data are available on a yearly basis for 122 countries. According to the index, the world's most globalized country is the [[Belgium]], followed by [[Austria]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The least globalized countries according to the KOF-index are [[Haiti]], [[Myanmar]] the [[Central African Republic]] and [[Burundi]].<ref>[http://www.globalization-index.org/ KOF Index of Globalization]</ref>.

[[A.T. Kearney]] and [[Foreign Policy]] Magazine jointly publish another [http://www.atkearney.com/main.taf?p=5,4,1,116 Globalization Index].

Measurement of attitudes toward globalization were sought after in a 2003 [http://www.globalfuture.net/2006/11/research-on-teenagers-attitudes-toward.html worldwide globalization study]. The study focused on teenagers' perceptions towards globalization and globalism, because soon they will be the adults living out the results of today's policy. The study examined the thesis of: Teenagers are natural globalists & Teenagers are afraid of globalization. The sample for this study included two hundred teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18, from New York, Lebanon, Azerbaijan, and the Philippines. The locations were urban. There was a survey administered with input from Gene Ellis, a professor (Wirtschaftswissenschaft Seminar) at the Eberhard Karls University of Tuebeingen, and [http://www.amglobal.com amglobal consulting] principal, economist, and former World Bank employee Andrerw Mack.

Topics of globalization and globalism were grouped into sub-categories. Globalization categories included immigration, trade, and diplomatic relations. Globalism included consumption, personal freedoms, technology, and culture.  

The results of the research suggested that both American teenagers and international teenagers are natural globalists and are largely in favor of globalization. Teenagers in New York had higher levels of support for globalization than globalism. International teens were more globalists. Importantly, all teens were very positive towards technology, cultural exchange, trade, consumption of international goods, and immigration. 

The study suggested that the future of international technology, trade, and culture will depend on bringing the concepts of globalization and globalism together. More so, the Internet seems to be one of the most important tools in linking teenagers globally and this suggests that this sort of communication should be developed around the world at a faster rate. Finally, it was suggested that the future of culture and trade will depend on the rate of technological progress.

== Anti-globalization  ==
{{main | Anti-globalization}}
{{unreferenced|date=October 2006}}

Critics of the economic aspects of globalization contend that it is not, as its proponents tend to imply, an inexorable process which flows naturally from the economic needs of everyone. The critics typically emphasize that globalization is a process that is mediated according to corporate interests, and typically raise the possibility of alternative global institutions and policies, which they believe address the moral claims of poor and working classes throughout the globe, as well as environmental concerns in a more equitable way.<ref>[http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/index.php?cd_language=2&id_menu= F<U+00F3>rum Social Mundial]</ref> The movement is very broad, including church groups, national liberation factions, [[left-wing]] parties, [[environmentalist]]s, [[peasant]] unionists, [[anti-racism]] groups, [[anarchism|anarchists]], those in support of [[relocalization]] and others. Some are [[reformist]], (arguing for a more humane form of capitalism) while others are more [[revolutionary]] (arguing for what they believe is a more humane system than capitalism) and others are [[reactionary]] believing globalization destroy national industry and jobs.

In terms of the controversial global migration issue, disputes revolve around both its causes, whether and to what extent it is voluntary or involuntary, necessary or unnecessary; and its effects, whether beneficial, or socially and environmentally costly. Proponents tend to see migration simply as a process whereby white and blue collar workers may go from one country to another to provide their services, while critics tend to emphasize negative causes such as economic, political, and environmental insecurity, and cite as one notable effect, the link between migration and the enormous growth of urban slums in developing countries. According to "The Challenge of Slums," a 2003 UN-Habitat report, "the cyclical nature of capitalism, increased demand for skilled versus unskilled labour, and the negative effects of globalization <U+2014> in particular, global economic booms and busts that ratchet up inequality and distribute new wealth unevenly <U+2014> contribute to the enormous growth of slums."<ref>[http://www.unhabitat.org/documents/media_centre/sowc/Featurerace.pdf]</ref>

Various aspects of globalization are seen as harmful by [[public interest|public-interest]] [[activism|activists]] as well as strong state [[nationalists]].  This movement has no unified name.  "Anti-globalization" is the media's preferred term; it can lead to some confusion, as activists typically oppose certain aspects or forms of globalization, not globalization ''per se''.  Activists themselves, for example [[Noam Chomsky]], have said that this name is meaningless as the aim of the movement is to globalize justice.<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20050311.htm]</ref>  Indeed, the [[Global Justice Movement|global justice movement]] is a common name.  Many activists also unite under the slogan "another world is possible", which has given rise to names such as ''[[altermondialism]]e'' in [[French language|French]].

There are a wide variety of kinds of "anti-globalization". In general, critics claim that the results of globalization have not been what was predicted when the attempt to increase free trade began, and that many institutions involved in the system of globalization have not taken the interests of poorer nations, the [[working class]], and the [[natural environment]] into account.

Economic arguments by [[fair trade]] theorists claim that unrestricted [[free trade]] benefits those with more [[financial leverage]] (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor {{fact}}.

Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as the promotion of [[corporatism|corporatist]] interests, which is intent on constricting the freedoms of individuals in the name of profit. They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of [[corporate entity|corporate entities]] shapes the political policy of nation-states {{fact}}.

Some "anti-globalization" groups argue that globalization is necessarily [[imperialistic]], is one of the driving reasons behind the [[Iraq war]] and is forcing savings to flow into the United States rather than [[developing nations]]; it can therefore be said that "globalization" is another term for a form of [[Americanization]], as it is believed by some observers that the United States could be one of the few countries (if not the only one) to truly profit from globalization {{fact}}.

Some argue that globalization imposes [[credit-based economics]], resulting in unsustainable growth of [[government debt|debt]] and debt crises {{fact}}.

The [[East Asian financial crisis|financial crises in Southeast Asia]] that began in 1997 in the relatively small, debt-ridden economy of [[Thailand]] but quickly spread to [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]] and eventually were felt all around the world, demonstrated the new risks and volatility in rapidly changing globalized markets {{fact}}. The [[IMF]]'s subsequent 'bailout' money came with conditions of political change (i.e. government spending limits) attached and came to be viewed by critics as undermining national sovereignty in ''neo-colonialist'' fashion {{fact}}. Anti-Globalization activists pointed to the meltdowns as proof of the high human cost of the indiscriminate global economy {{fact}}.

Many global institutions that have a strong international influence are not democratically ruled, nor are their leaders democratically elected. Therefore they are considered by some as supernational undemocratic powers{{fact}}.

The main opposition is to ''unfettered'' globalization ([[neoliberal]]; [[laissez-faire capitalism]]), guided by governments and what are claimed to be quasi-governments (such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]) that are supposedly not held responsible to the populations that they govern and instead respond mostly to the interests of corporations. Many conferences between trade and finance ministers of the core globalizing nations have been met with large, and occasionally violent, protests from opponents of "[[corporate globalism]]".

Some "anti-globalization" activists object to the fact that the current "globalization" globalizes money and corporations, but not people and [[Trade Union|unions]]. This can be seen in the strict [[immigration]] controls in nearly all countries, and the lack of [[labor (economics)|labour]] rights in many countries in the [[developing world]].

Another more conservative camp opposed to globalization is state-centric [[nationalists]] who fear globalization is displacing the role of nations in global politics and point to [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] as encroaching upon the power of individual nations.  Some advocates of this warrant for anti-globalization are [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]].

Many have decried the lack of unity and direction in the movement, but some such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have claimed that this lack of centralization may in fact be a strength.

Protests by the global justice movement have forced high-level international meetings away from the major cities where they used to be held, into remote locations where protest is impractical {{fact}}.
