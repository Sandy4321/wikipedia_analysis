'''Manchester Airport ''' {{Airport codes|MAN|EGCC}} is a major [[airport]] in [[Manchester]], [[UK]]. It opened to airline traffic in June 1938. It was initially known as '''Ringway Airport''' and during World War Two, as [[RAF Ringway]]. From 1975  until 1986, the title '''Manchester International Airport''' was used. It is located on the boundary between [[Cheshire]] and Manchester in the metropolitan county of [[Greater Manchester]].

It has two parallel runways, the second of which opened in 2001 at a cost of <U+00A3>172 million. The airport has three adjacent terminals and a [[Manchester Airport railway station|railway station]]. It is owned by the [[Manchester Airports Group]] (MAG) which is controlled by the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester and is the largest UK-owned airport group. 

Manchester Airport has a [[United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P712) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers and for flying instruction. 

Manchester Airport is the fourth busiest airport in the UK (after [[London Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted]]). In total passengers handled, Manchester ranked 48th in the world in 2005, down from 45th in 2004. <ref>http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=262428</ref>. Also, in 2006 Manchester had a recorded 234,835<ref>http://www.ukaccs.info/manchester/profile.htm</ref> aircraft movements, of which 213,100 were air transport movements (third highest in the UK) behind [[Heathrow]] and just under [[Gatwick]].

== Worldwide hub ==

The airport provides regular direct flights to many destinations worldwide by 85 airlines. Major North American carriers from Manchester include [[American Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[Delta Airlines]] and [[US Airways]] of the USA, and [[Air Canada]], [[Air Transat]] and [[Zoom Airlines]] from Canada. UK operators serving the USA market are [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]], [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] and [[British Airways]]. [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Emirates]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Air Blue]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Libyan Airways]], [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]], [[Syrian Arab Airlines]] and [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] serve the Asian market, whilst later this year [[Thomsonfly]] will start low-cost flights to [[Tel Aviv]]. Manchester is an international hub for [[BMI]] which offers several  destinations from terminal 3.  Charter airlines [[First Choice Airways]], [[MyTravel Airways|MyTravel]], [[Thomas Cook Airlines|Thomas Cook]] and [[Thomsonfly]] use Manchester as their primary operational base.  The airport serves as a secondary hub for [[Flybe]], [[Jet2.com]], [[bmibaby]], [[XL Airways]], [[Monarch Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] and [[Pakistan International Airlines]]. Several other British airline carriers have a strong presence.

Manchester Airport now has flights to more destinations than any other UK airport, offering flights to 225 destinations, with more direct routes than Heathrow and Gatwick. Heathrow offers 180 destinations; all scheduled, whilst Gatwick has about 200, (although the two London airports handle considerably more flights and passengers than Manchester).
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/manchester-airport-news-030607.htm |title=Manchester Airport offering more flights|publisher=Airport News|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref> Many of Manchester's overseas routes are served by charter flights to holiday destinations, some being seasonal.
   
Manchester also offers more destinations than some of the biggest airports in the US, including New York, Chicago and Dallas, although it is still slightly behind the three biggest `hubs' in the global aviation network - Atlanta, Frankfurt and Amsterdam - which each offer more than 250 destinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/manchester-airport-news-030607.htm |title=Manchester Airport offering more flights|publisher=Airport News|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>  However, Manchester serves more foreign destinations than Atlanta and Frankfurt (but not Amsterdam), although being much smaller in terms of total passengers handled.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/manchester-airport-news-030607.htm |title=Manchester Airport offering more flights|publisher=Airport News|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>   
    
Due to the large number of tour operators based at the airport, and charter destinations that are served, Manchester Airport was often labeled a 'bucket and spade airport', a term invented by the media{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. However, the proportion of scheduled passengers from Manchester has climbed from just 40% in the early 1990s to reach 63% during the last twelve months, making the label much less valid.

== Passenger numbers ==
[[Image:Manchester regional destinations.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Domestic and Irish destinations served from Manchester]] 

Manchester is the fourth busiest airport in the UK and the biggest outside of London, in terms of passengers per year. In the twelve months to December 2006, Manchester handled 22.12 million terminal passengers, a figure exceeded only by Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in the UK (per [[United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] 2006 annual traffic statistics report, Table 2.2). Manchester's passengers remained static in 2006, increasing by  0.2%, compared with average growth rates of 3.0% in the UK and 6.4% in Europe as a whole. The first eight months of 2007 have seen a steady overall reduction in passengers, with the moving 12 months total to August of 21.92 million, dropping by 1.2% compared with the previous year (UK airports average for the same period - 1.6% increase). The airport has fierce competition from [[London Stansted]] for passenger numbers and [[London Gatwick]] for total aircraft movements. In 2006 Manchester Airport was the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|world's 21st busiest airport in terms of international passengers]], (16th in 2004), and ranked above some of the world's major aviation hubs, including [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (this is because many international passengers from Manchester fly only 3/{{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} - a distance which would be 'inter-state' in the US) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci/display/main/aci_content.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-212-1376-1380_9_2__,  |title=International Passenger Traffic|publisher=Airports Council International|accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>

The airport's latest long range plan, published mid 2006 and widely circulated to interested parties, forecasts at page 39 that passenger numbers will increase to circa 38 million passengers per annum by 2015, a fast average growth rate of 6.2% and reach 50 million by 2030. The airport authorities are examining measures to cope with this postulated increase, which so far has not materialised.<ref>[http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/web.nsf/Content/OngoingDevelopment Manchester Airport - Ongoing Developments]</ref>

==Runway changes==
On [[7 June]] [[2007]], Manchester Airport's runway assignments were changed in relation to the Magnetic Compass bearings. The previous headings for the runways were 056<U+00B0> and 236<U+00B0> with assignments 06L/24R and 06R/24L respectively (23/4/07). The new headings for the runways are 054<U+00B0> and 234<U+00B0> with new assignments of 05L/23R and 05R/23L respectively. The signs located on taxiways and entrances to the runway were changed on the evening of the 6th June, 2007.<ref>http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/web.nsf/Content/Runwayredesignation</ref>

This ended 66 years of 24/06 operations, as the original tarmac runway, initially just {{convert|3000| ft|m|0}} long, was hastily and skimpily laid down in the latter half of 1941.

==Security==
[[Image:Security.jpg|200px|thumb|Passengers passing through Terminal 2 security]]
Manchester Airport is policed by the [[Greater Manchester Police]]. Several security related incidents have occurred at the airport in recent years. In particular:
*In 2002, a security firm successfully smuggled fake explosives, detonators and genuine firearms onto a flight.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1810345.stm</ref>
*In 2004, the [[BBC]]'s ''Whistleblower'' program revealed a series of security failures at the airport, including faulty metal detectors and a lack of regular random baggage checks. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3629336.stm</ref>
*In 2005, after spotted acting suspiciously, police used a [[taser]] to shoot a man on the apron, after he appeared to resist arrest.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4274516.stm</ref>
*On [[6 June]] [[2006]], Aabid Hussain Khan, 21, of [[West Yorkshire]] and a 16 year old boy were arrested at the airport and later charged under Section 57 of the [[Terrorism Act]], for conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause public nuisance by using poisons or explosives.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,,1798410,00.html ''The Guardian'': "Airport arrest man in court on terror charges"].</ref>

==Terminals and destinations==
Manchester Airport has three interconnected terminals, allowing passengers to move between all the terminals without going outside. Terminals 1 and 3 are located in the same building and are connected by various walkways/passages.  Terminals 1 and 2 are linked by the [[Skyway|skywalk]], with [[Moving walkway|travelators]] to aid passengers with the long walk.  The skywalk also connects the [[Manchester Airport railway station|railway station]] (where a few shops and services are located) and the [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]].
[[Image:Manchester airport terminal 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Manchester Airport Skywalk]]

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 handles international traffic and is served by many scheduled airlines and charter operators. It is also used as the base for [[MyTravel Airways|MyTravel]] and [[Thomas Cook Airlines]]; [[Monarch Airlines]] and [[Jet2.com]] also have a strong presence here. It has 24 stands, 18 of which have airbridges. Opened in 1962, the terminal has undergone many extensions and renovations since opening. There are currently 107 check-in desks in the terminal. The current passenger throughput is just over 9 million passengers per year. Terminal 1 is currently undergoing a major multi-million pound redevelopment. The first phase of the project is to expand and relocate the security search area. Following this, most of the current landside retail outlets will be scaled down, resulting in the creation of one of the UK's largest airside shopping facilities. The <U+00A3>40 million project is due to be completed by Summer 2008.

===Terminal 2===
[[Image:Ringway-t2.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Terminal 2]]
Terminal 2 is mostly used by long haul and [[charter]] traffic. It opened in 1993 and is the airport's other major international terminal, handling many scheduled and international flights. Some European scheduled airlines such as [[Air France]], [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines|KLM]] and [[Air Malta]] operate flights out of the terminal.  Charter Airlines [[First Choice Airways]], [[XL Airways]] and [[Thomsonfly]] use the terminal as a base, whilst [[Pakistan International Airlines]] and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] have a strong presence too.  It has 15 gates, of which 14 have airbridges. There are currently 69 check-in desks, with plans to add more in future modifications of the terminal. Terminal 2 is planned to be capable of being extensively modified so it can eventually accommodate significantly more passengers than the current throughput of 7.8 million. This is a future project to be carried out within the next few years.

===World Freight Terminal===
[[Image:Great Wall Airlines Boeing 747-400 At Manchester International Airport.jpg|thumb|right| A [[Great Wall Airlines]] [[Boeing 747-400]]F cargo plane at Manchester Airport]]

During 2006, 150,300 tonnes of cargo and mail were handled at Manchester, an increase of 0.4% over the previous year (per [[United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority|CAA]] annual statistics table 2.2). November 2006 saw a new record set at Manchester, with it handling 14,546 tonnes of cargo in the month. This beat the previous best set in October 2004. By 2015 the total figure for cargo handled is expected to be around 250,000 tonnes per year. Manchester's two biggest cargo markets are the Far East and North America. The Far East is predominantly a source of import cargo for the airport and North America is a key destination for exports. The main cargo destination from Manchester is Hong Kong, with Cathay Pacific making a total of 12 freighter round trips every week. On August 28th 2007, [[FedEx Express]] announced the start of a direct freighter service from Manchester to the [[United States|USA]]. [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] aircraft are used on the non-stop service to [[Memphis International Airport]] which is flown four times per week, from Monday through Thursday 
<ref>[http://memphis.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2007/08/27/daily6.html?jst=cn_cn_lk]</ref>. On September 4th, [[Aeroflot]] inaugurated a direct cargo flight between [[Russia]] and the United Kingdom, the first of its kind. A [[DC-10]] freighter is used on the once a week service, which is flown on Tuesdays, although the airline has stated that it intends to increase this to daily scheduled service as soon as possible. The airport currently handles an average of 6 [[Boeing 747]] freighter flights daily. Cargo Airlines that serve Manchester are:
*[[Aeroflot-Cargo]] 
*[[Air Contractors]]
*[[Cathay Pacific Cargo]]
*[[Great Wall Airlines]] 
*[[Fedex]] - Operated by Air Contractors and Fedex
*[[Jett8 Airlines Cargo]]

==Ground transportation==
[[Image:Manchester airport ts.jpg|thumb|right|190px|TransPennine Express [[British Rail Class 185|Class 185]] arriving at [[Manchester Airport railway station|Manchester Airport Railway Station]]]]
The airport is approximately a 20 minute drive from [[Manchester City Centre]] and is reached by the [[M56 motorway]], with a dedicated [[spur route|spur road]] from the motorway at junction 5. The M56 is the main route used by traffic to reach the airport. There are also minor local roads serving the airport from the north ([[Wythenshawe]]) and the east ([[Heald Green]]). The A538 road serves the World Freight Terminal, to the south of the airport, and also connects to the M56 motorway at junction 6. It runs east-west serving the local towns of [[Altrincham]] and [[Wilmslow]]. 

Taxi ranks are situated by arrivals at all three terminals. Passengers driving to the airport can use the drop-off areas outside the terminal buildings, but when picking up passengers the airport requires that you park in the short stay car parks provided for a fee.
Long stay car parks are situated both on and off site.

[[Manchester Airport railway station]], forming part of ''The Station'', is located between Terminals 1 and 2. It is linked to the terminals using a ''Skylink'' moving walkway. Trains are operated either by [[Northern Rail]] or [[TransPennine Express]] and connect the airport to [[Manchester Piccadilly Station]] and other railways stations throughout northern England. Construction is now underway on building a third platform at the airport railway station, due to an increase in passenger numbers using the facility. The <U+00A3>15 million project will also meet the extra future demand for rail services to and from the airport and is expected to be completed by December 2008.

''The Station'' also incorporates a bus station (see [http://www.gmpte.com/destination/airport.pdf GMPTE map]) with buses to many towns within Greater Manchester as well as the 24 hour bus Skyline

There are also plans in place to build a [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] light rail extension to the airport from Manchester Piccadilly.

==Criticism==
Between 1997 and 1999 three [[protest]] camps were set up to oppose the building of the second runway, the felling of nearby trees on land owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in Styal, Cheshire and air transportation in general. Three different camps were set up Flywood, Arthur's Wood<ref>http://members.aol.com/pp3office/arthpr.htm</ref> and Cedar's Wood. [[Swampy]], a well known activist, was among many protesters.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/travel/runway2_history.shtml</ref>

Manchester Airport's second runway was built on around {{convert|100|acre|sqkm|1}} of greenbelt land. Four Grade II listed buildings were taken down piece by piece and were re-constructed nearby, and over <U+00A3>20m was spent on environmental restoration and protection. Nonetheless, there is criticism that existing natural habitats were destroyed. 

The SW end of the new runway is closer to the town of Knutsford and to the village of Mobberley. There has been an increase in noise experienced by local residents from the aircraft being lower and closer. 

In 2007 Manchester Airport wanted to build on further green belt land in Styal in order to increase its car parking.  However, Macclesfield Borough Council refused to give them planning permission to do so and expressed annoyance at the Airport for not investing enough in public transport.  <ref>http://www.thewilmslowexpress.co.uk/news/s/230/230055_victory_for_green_belt_campaigners_as_airports_plan_for_styal_is_rejected.html</ref>
(Currently the town of Knutsford and village of Mobberley, directly under the flight path of planes, have no direct transport links to the airport.)

== Public attractions ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Zulukilo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Trident 3B G-AWZK on display at the aviation viewing park]] -->
Manchester Airport has created several public viewing areas since the airport opened to the public in 1938. The 1960/70s pier-top facilities have been closed because of security concerns. In May 1997, an official "[[Aviation Viewing Park]]" was created, just off the A538 road on the western edge of the airfield. This provides the best viewing facilities for [[aircraft spotting]] at any major UK airport. Visitors can view aircraft taking off and landing from both runways, as well as aircraft taxi-ing to and from the runways. 

On display is G-BOAC, a retired British Airways [[Concorde]], once the flagship of the airline's seven-strong Concorde fleet, with access to its interior being by prior booking. The last airliner to be built in the UK, BAE Systems Avro RJX G-IRJX is also on view. The forward  fuselage of Monarch Airlines [[Douglas DC-10]] G-DMCA is on static display, which can be boarded by prior arrangement only. One of only two preserved Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B aircraft in the world, G-AWZK in full BEA livery, is open every weekend from April to October and is accessible with a pre paid ticket from the ticket office opposite the aviation shop. 

Good views of the runways can be obtained from the 'AVP', especially between 12:00 and 15:00 when runway 23R/05L is used for both landings and departures, this being closest to the viewing area itself. The park also features a cafe, and an aviation shop selling related items such as airband scanners, aircraft models books and stationery, and Concorde merchandise.

The roof of the short-stay car park at Terminal 1 features another official viewing area, which has been a spotters' location for the last 32 years. As part of a recent refurbishment, the caf<U+00E9> and aviation shop which were once part of the viewing area have now been closed, with the aviation shop moving to the Terminal 1 arrivals area.
