"'''Old Dan Tucker'''", also known as "'''Ole Dan Tucker'''", "'''Dan Tucker'''", and other variants, is a [[American popular music|popular American song]]. Its origins remain obscure; the tune may have come from oral tradition, and the words may have been written by songwriter and performer [[Dan Emmett]]. The [[blackface]] troupe the [[Virginia Minstrels]] popularized "Old Dan Tucker" in 1843, and it quickly became a [[minstrel show|minstrel]] hit, behind only "[[Miss Lucy Long]]" and "[[Mary Blane]]" in popularity during the [[antebellum]] period. "Old Dan Tucker" entered the [[folk music|folk vernacular]] around the same time. Today it is a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]] standard.

The first [[sheet music]] edition of "Old Dan Tucker", published in 1843, is a song of boasts and [[nonsense]] in the vein of previous minstrel hits such as "[[Jump Jim Crow]]" and "[[Gumbo Chaff]]". In exaggerated [[African American Vernacular English|Black Vernacular English]], the lyrics tell of Dan Tucker's exploits in a strange town, where he fights, gets drunk, overeats, and breaks other social [[taboo]]s. Minstrel troupes freely added and removed verses, and folk singers have since added hundreds more. Parodies and political versions are also known.

The song falls into the [[idiom]] of previous minstrel music, relying on [[rhythm]] and text declamation as its primary motivation. Its [[melody]] is simple and the [[harmony]] little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous minstrel fare. Musicologist Dale Cockrell argues that the song represents a transition between early minstrel music and the more European-style songs of minstrelsy's later years.

==Lyrics==
[[Image:Old Dan Tucker, from Scribner's Magazine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This 1877 illustration from ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' shows the Dan Tucker character as a rural black man.]]
"Old Dan Tucker" as originally published exemplifies the masculine boasting songs that predominated in early [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].<ref>Crawford 211.</ref><ref>Mahar 15, 228</ref> Modern analysts emphasize the song's rawness, [[racism]], and disdain for social taboos. In ersatz [[African American Vernacular English|Black Vernacular English]],<ref name="Cockrell 156">Cockrell 156.</ref><ref>McCulloch-Williams, quoted in Lomax and Lomax 259.</ref> the song uses short, active words such as ''runnin'' and ''cryin'', to portray Dan Tucker as a rough-and-ready [[black people|black]] man in the mold of [[Jump Jim Crow|Jim Crow]], [[Gumbo Chaff]],<ref name="Cockrell 155">Cockrell 155.</ref> and ultimately the [[tall tale]] [[frontiersman]]:<ref>Stearns and Stearns 43<U+2013>44.</ref>

<!-- The misspellings and typography here are in the original lyrics. Don't correct them. -->
:I come to town de udder night,
:I hear de noise an saw de fight,
:De watchman was a runnin roun,
:Cryin Old Dan Tucker's come to town.

:Gran' Chorus.

::So get out de way! Get out de way!
::Get out de way! Old Dan Tucker.
::Your to late to come to supper.

Tucker is an animalistic character, driven by sex, violence, and strong drink. He is ugly, unrefined, and unintelligent,<ref name="Cockrell 156"/> even infantilized.<ref>Lott 143<U+2013>144.</ref> As a stranger in town, his devil-may-care actions show his problems with or ambivalence to adapting to local [[mores]].<ref name="Mahar 228">Mahar 228.</ref> More broadly, Tucker's disdain for social [[norm (sociology)|norms]] allows the song to send up respectable [[middle class]] American society, as evidenced by the final verse:<ref>Crawford 208, 211.</ref>

:Tucker was a hardened sinner,
:He nebber said his grace at dinner;
:De ole sow squeel, de pigs did squall
:He 'hole hog wid de tail and all.

Other verses are simply [[nonsense]] that do not go along with the main narrative. Their lines seem to serve no other purpose than to make a rhyme or extend the patter scheme.<ref name="Mahar 230">Mahar 230.</ref> The third verse is one example:

:Here's my razor in good order
:Magnum bonum -- jis hab bought 'er;
:Sheep shell oats, Tucker shell de corn,
:I'll shabe you soon as de water get warm.<ref>All song quotations from "Old Dan Tucker" sheet music (1843), Charles H. Keith, Boston. Quoted in Waltz.</ref>

Dan Tucker is both the teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the [[grammatical person|first person]], whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This reflects the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit.<ref>Mahar 15.</ref> There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos.<ref name="Mahar 230"/> The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.<ref name="Mahar 228"/>

Individual companies probably selectively performed verses from the song or added new ones.<ref>Mahar 229<U+2013>230.</ref> For example, the Virginia Serenaders added verses about the [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and [[French people|French]].<ref>Mahar 397 note 40.</ref> At least four versions of the song were published with different lyrics during the 19th century.<ref>Winans 149.</ref> A [[parody]] called "[[Clar de Track]]" appears in some playbills and songsters.<ref name="Mahar 367">Mahar 367.</ref>

===Folk versions===
"Old Dan Tucker" entered [[folklore of the United States|American folklore]] soon after it was written. Its simple and malleable nature means that singers may begin or end it at any point or invent new verses on the spot.<ref>McCulloch-Williams, Martha, letter to the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'', quoted in Lomax and Lomax 258.</ref> In fact, hundreds of folk verses have been recorded.<ref>Lomax and Lomax 261.</ref> This is a common folk variant:

:Old Daniel Tucker wuz a mighty man,
:He washed his face in a fryin' pan;
:Combed his head wid a wagon wheel
:And he died wid de toofache in his heel.<ref>This verse or a variant thereof is quoted in Randolph, ''Ozark Folksongs'', Volume III, p. 303, ''A Prairie Home Companion Folk Song Book'' (both quoted in Waltz), and in Lomax and Lomax 261.</ref>

A common chorus variant goes:

:So, git outa de way for old Dan Tucker,
:He's come too late to git his supper.
:Supper's over and breakfast cookin',
:Old Dan Tucker standin' lookin'.<ref>This chorus or a variant thereof appears in Randolph, ''Ozark Folksongs'', Volume III, p. 303, ''A Prairie Home Companion Folk Song Book'' (both quoted in Waltz) and in Lomax and Lomax 261.</ref>

For decades "Old Dan Tucker" was used as part of a [[folk dance|dancing]] game.<ref>Casey 41.</ref> The players formed a ring, and one man moved to the center. He selected women to swing around according to the lyrics:

:Here's old Dan, he comes to town;
:He swings the ladies round and round.
:He swings one east, he swings one west,
:He swings with the one he loves the best.

The third woman chosen then became his new partner, and her old partner now took the role of "Old Dan".<ref>Gardner 116.</ref>

These folk versions can be quite ribald.<ref>McCulloch-Williams, quoted in Lomax and Lomax 259.</ref> This one, recalled by a man from his boyhood in [[Benton County, Arkansas]], in the 1910s, is one example:

:Old Dan Tucker was a fine old soul,
:Buckskin belly and a rubber ass-hole,
:Swallowed a barrel of cider down
:And then he shit all over town.<ref>Randolph 431.</ref>

"Old Dan Tucker" entered the folklore of [[history of slavery in the United States|slaves]] as well. This version from [[Orange County, North Carolina]], was recorded in the 1850s:

:Marster and Missus look' might fine<U+2014>
:Gwine to take a journey, gwine whar dey gwine,
:Crab grass a-dyin', red sun in de west,
:Saturday's comin', nigger gwine to rest.<ref>Avriett, ''The Old Plantation'', 140<U+2013>146, quoted in Abrahams, ''Singing the Master'', 236<U+2013>37. Quoted in Mahar 259.</ref>

===Political versions===
[[Image:Get off the Track sheet music.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Hutchinson Family Singers]]' "Get off the Track!" puts abolitionist lyrics to the tune of "Old Dan Tucker".]]
The original "Old Dan Tucker" and most folk variants are not political in nature.<ref name="Cockrell 156"/> However, as early as 1844, the [[Hutchinson Family Singers]] were performing "Get off the Track!" to its tune, billed as "A song for [[Abolitionism|Emancipation]]"<ref>Crawford 257.</ref> One verse and the chorus say:

:Ho! the car Emancipation
:Rides majestic thro' our nation,
:Bearing on its train the story;
:Liberty! a nation's glory.

:Get out the way! Every station!
:Freedom's car, Emancipation!<ref>Hutchinson, Jesse (1845). "Get off the Track!". ''The Liberty Minstrel''. Leavitt & Alden.</ref>

That same year, supporters of [[Henry Clay]] at a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] rally sang a version that makes references to Clay ("Ole Kentucky"), [[Martin Van Buren]], and [[James Buchanan]]:

:The people's fav'rite, Henry Clay, is now the 'fashion' of the day;
:And let the track be dry or mucky, we'll stake our pile on Ole Kentucky.

:Get out of the way, he's swift and lucky; clear the track for Ole Kentucky!<ref>Quoted in Harland 137.</ref>

In 1856, supporters of [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]]'s run for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination adopted the tune as his [[campaign song]] with the changed refrain "Get out the way, old Buchanan".<ref>May 74.</ref> [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s campaign song for the 1900 [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], changed the lyrics to say:<ref>Welsch 78<U+2013>79.</ref>

:Voters, come and hear my ditty,
:What was done at Kansas City:
:David Hill, the New York lion,
:Nominated Billy Bryan.

:Get out of the way, you Grand Old Party,
:You're so old, you're getting warty.<ref>Quoted in Welsch 78<U+2013>79</ref>

A version popular during the [[American Civil War]] adds references to [[Abraham Lincoln]]:

:Old Abe is coming down to fight,
:And put the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to flight;
:He's coming with the wedge and maul
:And he will split 'em one and all.

:Get out the way, you [[Stephen A. Douglas|little giant]]
:You can't come in, you're too short and pliant.<ref>Forcucci 131.</ref>

"Old Dan Tucker" is a [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]], a [[dance music|dance song]] wherein the rhythmic accent falls on the second and fourth beats rather than on the third.<ref>Cantwell 124.</ref> The song is largely Anglo-American in nature, although it has black influences. Its repetitive melodic [[idiom]] matches that of earlier minstrel standards, such as "Jump Jim Crow", "[[Coal Black Rose]]", and "[[Turkey in the Straw|Old Zip Coon]]".<ref name="Crawford 206">Crawford 206.</ref><ref>Lott 177<U+2013>178.</ref>

The song consists of 28&nbsp;[[bar (music)|bars]]. It begins with a boisterous eight-bar introduction. Four&nbsp;bars follow to frame the [[coda (music)|coda]]. The remainder consists of sixteen&nbsp;bars with lyrics, half devoted to [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], and half to [[refrain]].<ref name="Crawford 206"/> Each [[phrase (music)|phrase]] gives way directly to the next with no [[rest (music)|rests]] between sections.<ref name="Crawford 208">Crawford 208.</ref>

[[Rhythm]] is perhaps the most important component of "Old Dan Tucker". It begins with a cadenced introduction and little melody.<ref name="Crawford 210">Crawford 210.</ref> Even when the tune begins in earnest, it is flat and non-harmonized and does little more than provide a beat on which words are uttered.<ref name="Crawford 206"/><ref>Finson, John W. (1994). ''The Voices that Are Gone: Themes in Nineteenth-century American Popular Song''. New York: Oxford University Press. Quoted in Mahar 397 note 41.</ref> The [[refrain]] is [[syncopation|syncopated]] in a way that had only previously been used in the minstrel song "Old Zip Coon". The intense rhythm on the line "Get out the way!" generates a forward momentum and is answered by instruments in one example of the song's black-influenced [[call and response (music)|call and response]].<ref name="Crawford 208"/>

"Old Dan Tucker" was, of course, intended for stage performance. The verses are not only to be played but also acted out and danced to. Minstrels could begin leaping about at the introduction and coda, beginning the full music at the vocal section.<ref name="Crawford 208"/> Performers probably included instrumental versions of the chorus while they played, a rare practice in early minstrelsy.<ref name="Cockrell 156"/>

[[Musicology|Musicologist]] Dale Cockrell argues that "Old Dan Tucker" in fact represents a bridge between the percussive [[blackface]] songs of the 1830s and the more refined compositions of songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]].<ref name="Cockrell 155"/> Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, "Old Dan Tucker" is meant for more than just dancing; its tune is developed enough to stand on its own.<ref>Cockrell 156<U+2013>157.</ref> Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it "the best of what I have denominated the ancient negro ballads. The melody is far superior to anything that had preceded it."<ref> [[Nathanson, Y. S.]] (January 1855). "Negro Minstrelsy<U+2014>Ancient and Modern". ''Putnam's Monthly; a Magazine of American Literature, Science, and Art 5'', no. 25. P. 74. Quoted in Cockrell 156.</ref> Nathanson compared the song to works by [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Daniel Auber]].<ref name="Cockrell 156"/>

==Composition==
[[Image:Dan Emmett old.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Dan Emmett claimed to have written "Old Dan Tucker" while a boy in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], where he retired in his later years.]]
The origin of the music of "Old Dan Tucker" has always been obscure, and no [[sheet music]] edition from 1843, its year of its first publication, names a composer. The first performance of the tune (but not lyrics) may have happened as early as 1841.<ref name="Nathan 301">Nathan 301.</ref> The music may in fact be from the oral tradition or may have been a product of collaboration.<ref name="Crawford 206"/>

Nevertheless, "Old Dan Tucker" has been credited to at least three different songwriters: [[Dan Emmett]], J. R. Jenkins, and [[Henry Russell (musician)|Henry Russell]].<ref>Tracy 19.</ref> In his old age, Emmett related the traditional story to his biographer, [[H. Ogden Wintermute]]: "I composed ''Old Dan Tucker'' in 1830 or 1831, when I was fifteen or sixteen years old."<ref>Quoted in Chase 239.</ref> The biography claims that Emmett first played the song in public at a performance by a group of traveling entertainers. They lacked a fiddle player, and the local innkeeper suggested young Emmett to fill in. Emmett played "Old Dan Tucker" to the troupe manager's liking, and he debuted on the [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], village green in blackface to perform the song on the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]. Wintermute claims that the name Dan Tucker is a combination of Emmett's own name and that of his dog.<ref>Canebrake Minstrels.</ref><ref>Knowles 233, note 13.</ref> However, there is no evidence for any of this.<ref name="Rammel 91">Rammel 91.</ref> Instead, Emmett may merely have written the words.<ref name="Nathan 301"/> Even these seem to partially derive from an earlier minstrel song called "[[Walk Along John]]" or "Oh, Come Along John", first published in various songsters in the early 1840s.<ref>Rammel 90.</ref> Some verses have clear echoes in versions of "Old Dan Tucker":

:Johnny law on de rail road track,
:He tied de engine on his back;
:He pair's his corn wid a rail road wheel,
:It gib 'em de tooth ache in de heel.<ref>Quoted in Rammel 90.</ref>

The [[Charles Keith]] [[publishing|company]] published "Old Dan Tucker" in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1843.<ref name="Crawford 206"/> The sheet music credits words to Dan Emmett but says that the song is from "Old Dan Emmit's Original Banjo Melodies".<ref>Quoted in Crawford 206.</ref> The lack of attribution of the melody may be another sign that Emmett did not write it.<ref name="Crawford 206"/>

===Possible slave origin===
[[Image:Dan Tucker Graveyard.jpg|thumb|left|The graveyard where [[Daniel Tucker]] is buried in [[Elbert County, Georgia]], is a tourist attraction due to the minister's possible connection to the song.]]
A story dating to at least 1965 claims that "Old Dan Tucker" was written by slaves about a man named [[Daniel Tucker]] who lived in [[Elbert County, Georgia]]. Tucker was a farmer, ferryman, and minister who appears in records from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The story, as related by Mrs. Guy Rucker, the great-great-granddaughter of one of Tucker's neighbors, claims that Tucker became quite well liked by the slaves in his area through his ministry to them.<ref name="Wilcox 28">Wilcox 28.</ref>

According to this interpretation, the lyrics address Tucker directly. The chorus, "You're too late to get your supper" is a kindhearted taunt to a man who often arrived after dark, forcing his hosts to scrap up a meal for him.<ref name="Wilcox 28"/> The song's occasional lewdness is explained by the natural impromptu nature of its supposed origin.<ref>Wilcox 28<U+2013>29.</ref>

"Old Dan Tucker" does show evidence of black influence. For example, bizarre imagery in folk versions of the song (e.g., "toothache in his heel") may be a sign of legitimate black input (or of someone poking fun of slaves who had an incomplete knowledge of English).<ref name="Rammel 91"/> "Old Dan Tucker" most closely resembles [[music of Africa|African music]] in its call-and-response refrain.<ref name="Crawford 208"/>

Daniel Tucker was buried in Elbert County in 1818.<ref>Wilcox 29.</ref> The Elbert County Chamber of Commerce today promotes his grave as a [[tourist attraction]] due to his possible connection with the character from the song.<ref>Elbert County Chamber of Commerce.</ref>

==Popularity==
[[Image:Virginia Minstrels, 1843.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Virginia Minstrels]], seen here in a detail from cover of ''The Celebrated Negro Melodies, as Sung by the Virginia Minstrels'', first performed "Old Dan Tucker" in 1843.]]
In December 1842 and January 1843, Dan Emmett portrayed the character Old Dan Tucker in solo and duo performances; the playbills do not indicate whether he included the song in his act.<ref>Nathan 114.</ref> The [[Virginia Minstrels]] probably made "Old Dan Tucker" a regular part of their show beginning with their first performance at the [[Bowery Amphitheatre]] on February 6, 1843. Their minstrel show also included a comic scene loosely based on the song, "Dan Tucker on Horseback", about a black riding master. The piece starred [[Richard Pelham]] in the title role and [[Frank Brower]] as a black clown.<ref>Nathan 118<U+2013>119.</ref> "Old Dan Tucker" did not appear on a Virginia Minstrels playbill until a March 7 and 8 performance at Boston's [[Masonic Temple (Boston)|Masonic Temple]]. There, the playbill described it as "OLD DAN TUCKER, a Virginian Refrain, in which is described the ups and downs of Negro life."<ref>Quoted in Nathan 119.</ref> As early as February 15, Emmett billed himself as "Old Dan Emmett".<ref>''New York Herald'', 2/15/1843, p. 3.</ref>

By the end of March, "Old Dan Tucker" was a hit, and it quickly became the Virginia Minstrels' most popular song.<ref name="Nathan 121">Nathan 121.</ref><ref name="Cockrell 155"/> Robert Winans found the song on 49% of the minstrel playbills he surveyed from the 1843<U+2013>1847 period (behind only "[[Miss Lucy Long]]"),<ref>Winans 148.</ref> and research by musicologist William J. Mahar suggests that it was behind only "[[Mary Blane]]" and "Lucy Long" in its frequency of publication in antebellum songsters.<ref name="Mahar 367"/> The next year, Dan Tucker returned in the popular "[[Ole Bull and Old Dan Tucker]]", which pits him against Ole Bull in a contest of skill.<ref>Mahar 22, 370 note 5.</ref> Sequels such as "[[De New Ole Dan Tucker]]" and "[[Old Dan Tucker's Wedding]]" followed.<ref>Lott 267, note 3.</ref> Other companies adopted Tucker for comedy sketches, such as burlesques of ''[[La sonnambula]]'' by [[Buckley's Serenaders]] in 1850 and [[Sanford's Opera Troupe]] in 1853.<ref>Mahar 107.</ref>

The song became so identified with Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels that it became part of their foundation myth. [[Billy Whitlock]] and [[George B. Wooldridge]] both claimed that the troupe members played "Old Dan Tucker" in their first impromptu performance together:<blockquote>. . . as if by accident, each one picked up his tools and joined in a chorus of "Old Dan Tucker," while Emmett was playing and singing. It went well, and they repeated it without saying a word. Each did his best, and such a rattling of the principal and original instruments in a minstrel band was never heard before.<ref>''New York Clipper'', April 13, 1878. Quoted in Nathan 116.</ref></blockquote> Emmett repeated this story in the May 19, 1877, ''[[New York Clipper]]'', although other details changed.<ref>Nathan 117.</ref> The press began to refer to Emmett as "Ole Dan Tucker",<ref name="Nathan 121"/> and Emmett eventually adopted the nickname. The Virginia Minstrels sometimes went by "Ole Dan Tucker and Co."<ref>Lawrence 232 note 26.</ref> They were called "Old Dan Tucker & Co.," either by themselves or by the press, as early as February 16, 1843.<ref>''New York Herald'', 2/16/1843, p. 3.</ref>

The song's disdain for the customs of the [[upper class]]es hit a chord with [[working class]] audiences.<ref name="Crawford 210"/> On January 28, 1843, ''[[The New York Sporting Whip]]'' reported that the song had been adopted by a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], street [[gang]] called the Hallow Guards. As their leader, Stovepipe Bill, led them against a military raid, he sang the verses followed by the gang singing the chorus.<ref>Cockrell 200 note 62.</ref> Two years later, ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' remarked, "At this present moment, a certain ubiquitous person seems to be in the way of the whole people of these United States simultaneously."<ref>''The Knickerbocker'', 1845, quoted in ''The Black Perspective in Music'' (1975), p. 87<U+2013>88; quoted in turn in Crawford 210 note 23.</ref> Nathanson claimed that "Old Dan Tucker" had "been sung, perhaps, oftener than any melody ever written."<ref>Quoted in Nathan 179 note 17.</ref>

In 1871, 28 years after its first published edition, ''[[Board and Trade]]'' listed editions of "Old Dan Tucker" in print from seven different publishers. The song had by default fallen into the [[public domain]].<ref>Crawford 870<U+2013>871 note 21.</ref> In later decades, "Old Dan Tucker" became a standard of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]],<ref>Cantwell 104.</ref><ref>Malone 173.</ref> with recordings by such artists as [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[Uncle Dave Macon]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Gid Tanner]] and his [[Skillet Lickers]].<ref>Waltz and Engle.</ref> It is referred to in [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel [[The Grapes of Wrath]]. More recently, rock musician [[Bruce Springsteen]] made a [[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions|recording]]. Children's music collections frequently feature the song. In the 1935 novel ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'' by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], the character Mr. Edwards sings the song as his trademark; accordingly, the [[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)| ''Little House on the Prairie'' television series]] from the 1970s and 1980s uses the song as a [[leitmotif]] for the character.
