<U+201C>'''Treehouse of Horror XII'''<U+201D> is the first episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]]. Because of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s contract with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]], the episode first aired on the Fox Network in the United States on November 6, 2001, nearly one week after [[Halloween]]. It is the twelfth annual ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' episode, consisting of three self-contained segments. In the first segment, a gypsy puts a curse on [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], which puts everybody he cares about in danger. In the second segment, which is a parody on both ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Demon Seed]]'', the Simpson family buys a new house, who falls in love with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and attempts to kill Homer. In the third and final segment, which lampoons the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' franchise, Lord Montymort attempts to capture [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], a skilled magician, in order to drain her magic powers.

The episode was written by [[Joel H. Cohen]], [[John Frink]], [[Don Payne]] and [[Carolyn Omine]] while [[Jim Reardon]] served as the director. It was the first ''Treehouse of Horror'' since the original special to not employ <U+201C>scary names<U+201D> in the credits. According to executive producer [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], this was due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], after which the ''Simpsons'' staff tried to be more serious and sensitive, however according to current [[show runner]] [[Al Jean]], the <U+201C>scary names<U+201D> were dropped because they were too difficult to come up with. The episode contains numerous references and parodies to [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] works, including ''2001: A Space Oddysey'', ''Demon Seed'', ''Harry Potter'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. The episode also features [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Matthew Perry]] as guest stars.

The episode was considered a success in the ratings when it first aired, boosting the Fox Network to victory among viewers between ages 18 and 49 the night it was broadcast. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from critics. In particular, critics were dissatisfied with the last segment of the show, while <U+201C>House of Whacks<U+201D> was often considered to be the best of the three.

==Plot==
Outside [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]]' manor, [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] is standing on a ladder, trying to put up a small [[orange (colour)|orange]] [[bat]] decoration on a [[weather vane]]. He slips on the ladder, grabs on an electric cord and slides down into an electricity box and gets [[electricution|zapped]] by it. A tower from Mr. Burns' mansion breaks in half, damaging a [[mausoleum]], which opens up four caskets which in turn reveal three skeletons which all resemble Mr. Burns, dressed in various costumes.
Later, we see the Simpsons dressed up in costumes, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] as [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] as [[Wilma Flintstone]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] as [[conjoined twins]], and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] as a [[hobo]]. The family sees the building and caskets on fire, and screams in terror. They run out the gate, which as it closes, has its bars slice the family. The slices of the Simpsons continue to scream and run away. Mr. Burns, delighted, pats the orange bat as it comes to life and flies into the screen, revealing the title, "The Simpsons Halloween Special XII."

===Hex and the City===
After having destroyed the office of a [[Romani people|gypsy]] [[fortune teller]], the gypsy puts a curse on Homer, who is doomed to bring misery to everyone around him. The curse soon takes effect, with Marge growing a beard from her blue hair (which eventually covers her whole body), Lisa turning into a centaur (starting with [[horse]] feet then going up to her armpits), Bart's neck becoming long and floppy as a result of Homer strangling him, Maggie becoming a [[ladybug]] with a human head, and [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]] crushed by a [[helicopter]]. On what [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] (who inexplicably ends up trapped in his pickled egg jar) suggested, Homer sets out to find a leprechaun to end the curse. To get the leprechaun, Homer uses [[Lucky Charms]] cereal as bait, eventually finding a little Irish [[leprechaun]] after picking through a group of other magical creatures. Homer takes the leprechaun home, but it is extremely [[hyperactivity|hyperactive]] and it runs amok. Homer takes the leprechaun to the gypsy's office and sics it on her. Initially,  the leprechaun lunges at the gypsy and the two of them roll around on the floor, fighting -- until it turns into passionate kissing and fondling. The leprechaun and the Gypsy get married, and are pronounced husband and wife by [[Yoda]] at a wedding attended by other gypsies and mythical creatures, as well as the Simpson family. Homer then remarks how everything ended happily, but a now fully hair covered Marge reminds him that Bart committed [[suicide]] by drowning in his cereal, and says that apologizing will bring him back to life. Out of sheer pride, Homer refuses.

===House of Whacks===
The Simpsons buy an automated upgrade for their home called <U+201C>Ultrahouse,<U+201D> which comes with three celebrity voices: [[Matthew Perry]] (which Bart doesn't like), [[Dennis Miller]] (notorious for causing murder-suicides), and [[Pierce Brosnan]] (which Marge picks because Brosnan was on ''[[Remington Steele]]''). Marge finds the house, which does all the work for the Simpsons, charming. The house soon becomes infatuated with Marge after the two share a bath and decides to kill Homer after having a conversation with him about how lucky he is to be married to Marge. In the middle of the night, the house lures Homer downstairs by frying [[bacon]]. The next morning, Marge fears that Homer is dead and attempts to escape the house with the kids, but Ultrahouse locks her inside and tries to subdue her. When Marge and the kids attempt escape again, they find that Homer is alive, but has cuts all over his body and a gaping hole in the back of his head. After the house attempts to kill him in many ways, Homer leads a charge to the basement where he attacks the CPU's "British charm unit" (after accidentally destroying the water softener), which makes it speak with a rude American dialect before powering down and finally shutting off. Feeling bad that she has to toss out the Ultrahouse, Marge gives the CPU to her sisters [[Patty and Selma]], whose mundane stories drives the CPU to kill itself.

===Wiz Kids===
Bart and Lisa go to the "Spingwart's School of Magicry" in which they practice witchcraft, such as [[The Frog Prince (story)|turning frogs into princes]]. [[Mr.Burns|Lord Montymort]] notices Lisa's spells and he and his snake sidekick, [[Waylon Smithers|Slithers]] decide to capture Lisa in order to increase his power. Montymort looks for someone to assist him and chooses Bart, who agrees to Montymort's proposal. On the night of the magic recital at Springwart's School of Magicry, Lisa attempts a "[[levitation|levitating]] dragon trick" on a gigantic dragon that is released onto the stage. Lisa is shocked to find that her spell will not work, and then notices that Bart has replaced her wand with a [[Twizzlers|Twizzler]]. The dragon morphs into a giant Montymort who captures Lisa and begins sucking up her power. Bart casts a spell against Montymort, but is struck by lightning. In a last-ditch effort, Bart charges at Montymort and stabs him in the shin with his magic wand. Montymort dies (as his shin was the source of all his magic) and is eaten by a crying Slithers. Bart and Lisa walk away, trying to forget everything that happened.
