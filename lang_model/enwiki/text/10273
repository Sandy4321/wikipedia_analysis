'''Cargolink AS''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[railway company]]. Owned by the automotive distribution company [[Autolink]], Cargolink has operated both [[autorack]] and [[containerization|container]] trains since November 2008. Cargolink has a fleet of ten diesel locomotives, five [[shunter]]s, 100 [[autorack]]s and 60 container cars. Combined autorack and container trains are operated up to five times per week along the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line|S<U+00F8>rland-]], [[Bergen Line|Bergen-]], [[Rauma Line|Rauma-]], [[R<U+00F8>ros Line|R<U+00F8>ros-]] and [[Nordland Line|Nordland]] Lines, as well as services through Sweden.

Autolink, the largest distributor of automobiles in Norway, has traditionally bought train services from [[CargoNet]]. In 2007, they signed a contract with [[Ofotbanen (company)|Ofotbanen]], and at the same time bought 40% of the company. However, Ofotbanen was in financial difficulties, causing a dispute between the two owners. The result was that Autolink formally established Cargolink in March 2008, without the knowledge of Ofotbanen, and terminated the contract with Ofotbanen in July. Cargolink received an operating licence in September and service started in November.

On contract from Autolink, Cargolink operates autorack trains throughout large portions of the [[Rail transport in Norway|Norwegian railway network]], from the seaports in Drammen and Oslo.

==History==
===Autolink and Ofotbanen===
{{main|Ofotbanen (company)}}

Autolink has traditionally owned a large pool of autoracks. These have been operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]], and subsequently their subsidiary [[CargoNet]].<ref name=dt081212>{{cite web |url=http://dt.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081212/NYHET/929615791 |author=[[Drammens Tidende]] |title=Klar til avgang |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company [[Ofotbanen (company)|Ofotbanen]], and at the same time signed a haulage contract with them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofotenstidende.no/nyhet.asp?id=297&fs=1 |author=Moe, Kjetil |title=Autolink inn i Ofotbanen AS |work=[[Ofotens Tidende]] |date=19 February 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In March, Autolink ordered additional 70&nbsp;new autoracks for NOK&nbsp;175 million.<ref name=westman />

Ofotbanen have since their establishment had financial difficulties. The contract with Autolink had helped, but in July 2008, Autolink canceled their contract with Ofotbanen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofotenstidende.no/nyhet.asp?id=4046&fs=8 |author=Moe, Kjetil |title=Usikker fremtid for biltogkj<U+00F8>ringen |work=[[Ofotens Tidende]] |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Two weeks later, Autolink announced that they would establish their own railway company, which they had been working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because the majority owner<U+2014>Rail Management, in turn owned by Mons Bolin<U+2014>would not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell their shares to Autolink.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fremover.no/lokale_nyheter/article3658637.ece |author=Hansen, Fritz |title=- OBAS g<U+00E5>r under |work=[[Fremover]] |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> From 29 July, all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen representing Autolink withdrew from their positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dt.no/article/20080722/NYHET/201569392 |author=[[Drammens Tidende]] |title=Autolink i bitter togkrig |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The matter ended in court, with a case to determine whether Autolink should be allowed to take control of four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal in regard to the contract, [[Ofoten District Court]] ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership of the radios to Autolink.<ref name=martinsen>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nordland/1.6144085 |author=Martinsen, Gerd Elise |title=Ofotbanen fikk medhold |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK Nordland]] |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. There was agreement that Autolink, on 13&nbsp;February 2008, had bought five [[shunter]]s from Ofotbanen for NOK&nbsp;12 million, of which NOK&nbsp;9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofotenstidende.no/nyhet.asp?id=4200 |author=Berg, Hilde |title=M<U+00E5> g<U+00E5> gjennom avtalene |work=[[Ofotens Tidende]] |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Ofotbanen lost their license from the [[Norwegian Railway Inspectorate]] on 7&nbsp;October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not documented necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbanetilsynet.no/Nyhetsarkiv/Tilsynet-varsler-tilbakekall-av-lisens-for-Ofotbanen/ |author=[[Norwegian Railway Inspectorate]] |title=Tilsynet varsler tilbakekall av lisens for Ofotbanen |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 24&nbsp;October, the company was declared bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w2.brreg.no/kunngjoring/hent_en.jsp?kid=20080000472060&sokeverdi=983431879 |author=[[Br<U+00F8>nn<U+00F8>ysund Register Centre]] |title=Konkurs - <U+00E5>pning |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ht.no/incoming/article191150.ece |author=God<U+00F8>, Knut |title=Ofotbanen konkurs |work=[[Harstad Tidende]] |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK&nbsp;10 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fremover.no/lokale_nyheter/article3876005.ece |author=Fremover |title=Starter p<U+00E5> nytt |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Establishment===
Work on establishing the new company was initiated by Autolink in March 2008, with the company formally established on 27&nbsp;March.<ref name=martinsen /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://w2.brreg.no/enhet/sok/detalj.jsp?orgnr=991391746 |author=[[Br<U+00F8>nn<U+00F8>ysund Register Centre]] |title=Cargolink AS |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> It received an operating license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 18&nbsp;September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbanetilsynet.no/Jernbanevirksomheter/?object=270 |author=[[Norwegian Railway Inspectorate]] |title=CargoLink AS |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Five shunters that were operated by Ofotbanen, but owned by Autolink, were transferred to Cargolink. In addition, ten [[NSB Di 6|Di 6]] diesel locomotives have been leased from [[Vossloh]], with options for later purchase.<ref name=dt081025 /> Operations started on 2&nbsp;November, with 22&nbsp;engineers based in Drammen.<ref name=dt081212 /> Since the company has an all-diesel fleet, management is working to reroute trains to [[Trondheim]] and [[Northern Norway]] along the [[R<U+00F8>ros Line]] instead of the [[Dovre Line]]. CargoNet and Ofotbanen had been using the Dovre Line because it is electrified, giving lower operating costs despite its elevation, {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the R<U+00F8>ros Line. After initial trial runs with only three locomotives, full service was introduced later in November.<ref name=dt081217 />
