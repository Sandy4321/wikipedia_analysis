The '''Aerotr<U+00E9>n''' is a [[people mover]] operating at [[Mexico City International Airport]], near [[Mexico City]], in [[Mexico]].  The {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=on}} automated people mover (APM) provides a link between Terminal 1 and the newer Terminal 2. 

Opened in 2007, it was part of the major expansion to the airport, which is the busiest in [[Latin America]]<ref>World's busiest airports (May 2006 - May 2007), http://www.aicm.com.mx/acercadelaicm/Estadisticas/index.php?Publicacion=169</ref>.  The link is only designed to transfer passengers connecting between flights, who must be in possession of and show a valid flight ticket.

== Background ==
The Aerotr<U+00E9>n airport link at Mexico City International Airport connects Terminal 1 with the new Terminal 2 which had been constructed on the opposite end of the runway from the existing terminal.

The system was designed to transport 540 transfer [[passengers per hour per direction]] (pphpd). with the journey taking 5:25 minutes in each direction and the train pausing (dwelling) at each end station for 60 seconds.<ref name="References-p8">{{cite book|first=DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car|title=References|publisher=[[DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car]] GmbH|date=2008|pages=8}}</ref>

===Construction===
The Mexico City International Airport Automated People Mover System Project was started on August 12, 2005 when a contract was signed between the airport owners [[Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares]] (ASA) and [[DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car]]. The system was completed by November 2007 at a price of <U+20AC>52 million<ref name="planner-p87">{{cite book|first=DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car|title=Automated People Mover (APM): Planner's Guide|publisher=[[DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car]] GmbH|date=2008|pages=87}}</ref>.

The system was built and designed in a [[joint venture]] with ''{{lang|es|Ingenieros Civiles y Asociados}}'' (ICA), Mexico's largest construction company.

The area around Mexico City suffers from soil settlement, and this had to be allowed for.  The elevated [[guideway]] structure has the ability to be adjusted for ground settlements. Steel adapters between the steel truss and the concrete columns allow later height adjustments to compensate for any ground movement.

===Technology===
A single-track, single train, [[Cable Liner]] Shuttle design was chosen.  The installed system is {{convert|3025|m|ft}} in length and operates at a speed of {{convert|45|km/h|mph}} between the two terminal stations.

The train is composed of four cars, each holding 26 passengers and making of a total of 104 passengers per train. An option was included for lengthening the original four car train to six cars, providing an increase from 540 pphpd up to 800 pphpd.
