'''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Gurgacz''' (1914 &ndash; 14 September 1949) was a [[Poles|Polish]] Catholic priest, member of the [[Society of Jesus]], and chaplain of the anti-communist underground.<ref name=doom>{{cite web|url=http://www.doomedsoldiers.com/crimes-in-the-majesty-of-law.html|title=Communist Courts In Poland (1944-1956): Crimes In the Majesty of "Law"|publisher=The Doomed Soldiers|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

==Biography==
In 1931, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Stara Wie<U+015B>, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Stara Wie<U+015B>]], and in 1942 he was ordained as chaplain.

After World War II, he strongly criticized communist order in [[Poland]]. It brought him immense popularity among believers.<ref name="Rzepa"><U+0141>osi<U+0144>ska 2009.</ref> Between 1945 and 1947, he worked as hospital chaplain in [[Gorlice]] and from 1947 to 1948 in [[Krynica-Zdr<U+00F3>j|Krynica]]. It was there that he entered an armed unit of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist underground Polish opposition]]; specifically, the Polish Underground Independency Army (Polska Podziemna Armia Niepodleg<U+0142>o<U+015B>ciowa, PPAN). He was awarded the rank of captain. While serving with the army he convinced partisans to not carry out executions of [[Polish Workers' Party]] activists, who were beaten and forced to eat communist party identity cards.<ref name="Rzepa"/>

On 2 July 1949, partisans robbed a bank in Krak<U+00F3>w in order to gain money needed to escape to Western Europe.<ref name="Rzepa"/> They were caught and arrested by the [[Office of Public Security]], and later in a [[show trial]] sentenced to death by judge [[Ludwik Kie<U+0142>tyka]]. Although Gurgacz did not participate in the robbery, he turned himself in <ref name=prez></ref><ref name=zwali>{{cite web|url=http://krakow.gazeta.pl/krakow/1,71704,7360884,Zwali_go_Popieluszka_okresu_stalinowskiego.html|title=Zwali go Popie<U+0142>uszk<U+0105> okresu stalinowskiego|author=Ma<U+0142>gorzata Skowro<U+0144>ska|publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> and was executed by a firing squad on 14 September 1949 in [[Montelupich prison]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].<ref name="Rzepa"/>

There is an obelisk built to his memory at [[Hala <U+0141>abowska]] in [[Beskid S<U+0105>decki]] mountain range. Each year veterans of [[Armia Krajowa]] and PPAN meet at this place. Memorial plaques to W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Gurgacz and fallen soldiers of PPAN are located in churches in [[Nowy S<U+0105>cz]] and Krynica. In June 2008, he was posthumously awarded Commander's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].<ref name=prez>{{cite web|url=http://www.prezydent.pl/archiwum/rok-2008/art,300,krzyz-komandorski-orderu-odrodzenia-polski-dla-kapelana-zolnierzy-wykletych.html|title=Krzy<U+017C> Komandorski Orderu Odrodzenia Polski dla kapelana <U+017B>o<U+0142>nierzy Wykl<U+0119>tych|publisher=Office of the [[President of Poland]]|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>
