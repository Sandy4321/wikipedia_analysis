'''Albert Cook Outler''' ([[1908]]&ndash;[[1989]]) was a [[20th century]] [[United States|American]] [[Methodism|Methodist]] theologian and philosopher.  Outler is generally considered to be one of the most important [[John Wesley|Wesley]] scholars in the history of the Church as well as the first real [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]] theologian.  He was also a key figure in the 20th century [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical movement]].

Outler was born and raised in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and was an [[Holy Orders|ordained]] Methodist [[Elder (religious)|Elder]] who served in several appointments.  He received his [[Ph.D.]] degree from [[Yale University]], teaching at both Yale and [[Duke University]] before beginning a long tenure at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Texas]].  He was a delegate to [[Consultation on Church Union]], served on the [[Faith and Order Movement|Faith & Order]] board of the [[World Council of Churches]] and was an official observer at the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Outler is widely credited with being the first to recognize John Wesley's method for theologizing, via what Outler referred to as the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]]: Scripture, Church Tradition, Reason, and Personal Experience.  This understanding of Wesleyan theology is prevalent throughout Methodism, particularly in The United Methodist Church.  Using this model, Outler was a key figure in organizing the theological statement put forth by The United Methodist Church after its formation in 1968.

With his many references to the early Church, Outler's work has proven very influential to those in the [[Paleo-Orthodoxy|paleo-orthodox movement]] and contemporary [[evangelicalism]], notably [[Thomas Oden]].

Albert Outler wrote and edited a great many works. Many of his writings have been collected in the ''Albert Outler Library'' series by Bristol House publishers.
