==History==
After the death of [[Andrew Fluegelman]], creator of [[PC-Talk]], a gap was left in the marketplace for dial-up and terminal emulation software.  Bruce Barkelew and Tom Smith, students at the [[University of Missouri]], created ProComm under the name PIL Software Systems as shareware in [[1985]] and incorporated in 1986 as Datastorm Technologies Inc.  It was distributed through various [[BBS]]s.

Datastorm chose [[Columbia, MO]] to open their company due to the relatively low cost of living<ref>{{cite news
