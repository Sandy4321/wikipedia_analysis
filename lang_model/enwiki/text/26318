'''Jeremy Kyle''' (born 7 July 1965 in [[Canning Town]], [[London]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[radio]] and [[television]] [[Presenter|broadcaster]], best known for his own daytime [[talk show]] on [[ITV]], ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]''.

==Radio career==
From 1986 to 1995, Kyle worked as a salesman for [[life insurance]], recruitment, and radio advertising.<ref name="Jezza"/> After a brief stint presenting, he was signed by Kent's [[Invicta FM]] in 1996.  In 1997, he joined Birmingham's [[BRMB]], presenting the shows ''Late & Live'' and ''Jezza's Jukebox''.<ref name="NMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.nmplive.co.uk/viewTalent.aspx?id=1917|title=Jeremy 'Jezza' Kyle|publisher=NMP Live|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rawstorne|first=Tom|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-398160/The-secrets-Jeremy-Kyle-show.html|title=The secrets of the Jeremy Kyle show|work=The Daily Mail|date=2006-07-28}}</ref>

In 2000, Kyle moved to the [[Century FM]] network, taking this format with him. The show was called ''Jezza's Confessions''. It broadcast between 9pm and 1am. He won a Sony Award for ''Late & Live'' in 2001.<ref name="Jezza"/> On 1 July 2002, he made his first broadcast on [[Virgin Radio]], presenting ''Jezza's Virgin Confessions'' every weekday 8pm - Midnight. In mid 2003 he broadcast the show from 9pm - 1am every weekday and, in January 2004, the show went out 10pm - 1am Sunday - Thursday. The beginning of June 2004 saw his departure from Virgin Radio.

In July 2004, [[Capital Radio]] announced it had signed Kyle to present the ''Confessions'' show on London's Capital FM from September 5, 2004. The new programme aired from Sunday to Thursday 10pm - 1am including live calls on relationship issues of all kinds. ''Capital Confessions'' came to an end on December 22, 2005, to make way for ''The Jeremy Kyle Show'', a similar show which ran from January 2006 to December 2006, at which point Kyle left radio altogether.

In late 2007, Kyle began a new show (''The Jeremy Kyle Show''), broadcasting across [[Gcap Media]]'s [[The One Network|One Network]], of which [[Orchard FM]], [[Invicta FM]] and [[BRMB]], his previous employers, are a part. The programme differs from his previous shows in that he now interviews other celebrities. Kyle also began broadcasting a new show, on [[Essex FM]], in November 2007.

In July 2008, it was announced that Kyle would be joining [[talkSPORT]] from 21 September 2008 to present a lunchtime sports show every Sunday called ''The Jeremy Kyle Sunday Sports Show''.

==TV career==
{{main|The Jeremy Kyle Show}}
In 2005 Kyle moved his format to [[ITV]], with a programme also entitled ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]''. Here Kyle has reached his widest audience to date. His often aggressive manner with guests (parodied by ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'') has been the source of both popularity and criticism. He is seemingly unafraid of reprisal from his guests, believing that speaking his mind is better than holding his peace. Guests sometimes take offence at Kyle's comments, one guest even attempting to throw a chair at him, but he often justifies his criticism by claiming that he only wants to help them. Kyle recently claimed on air that his show was watched by 1.8 million viewers, a very high figure for a daytime chat show. The programme has also been parodied in the BBC comedy ''[[The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle]]''.

In September 2007, Judge Alan Berg described ''The Jeremy Kyle Show'', popular with students, as trash which existed to "titillate bored members of the public with nothing better to do". He went on to say "It seems to me that the purpose of this show is to affect a morbid and depressing display of dysfunctional people whose lives are in turmoil" and added that it was "human bear-baiting".<ref>{{cite news

The judge so characterised it "after [a] husband was provoked into headbutting [his] wife's lover in front of [Kyle's] studio audience".<ref>"Human bear-baiting", ''Daily Mail'', 25 September 2007</ref>

In February 2008, ''The Jeremy Kyle Show'' was again criticised in court after a man who found out during the recording of a show that he was not the father of his wife's baby later pointed an air rifle at her.<ref name=Wales>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7243174.stm BBC NEWS | Wales | Attack after Kyle show 'tragedy']</ref>

Other shows Kyle is involved with include ''Kyle's Academy'', a ten part series for ITV1 daytime which first aired on 18 June 2007.<ref name=Wales/> A team of experts (life coaches and psychotherapists), headed by Jeremy Kyle take 5 people and work with them over an intensive fortnight to help them on the road to a happier more fulfilled life.

Kyle has also presented ''Half Ton Hospital'', a show about morbidly [[obese]] people in the [[United States]].

==Personal life==
Kyle attended the [[Reading Blue Coat School]] and [[University of Surrey]].<ref name="Jezza">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/may/29/ITV.mondaymediasection|title=Call me Jezza|last=Silver|first=James|date=2006-05-29|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref> He has one daughter, Harriet (born June 1990), with his first wife Kirsty Rowley whom he married in July 1989 in [[Almondsbury]] near [[Bristol]]. Kyle and Rowley became engaged in December 1988, and their marriage lasted until December 1990, during which time his wife claims that Kyle had carefully concealed a gambling habit from her.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sanderson|first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=491599&in_page_id=1773|title='He lied... he called me a slut.

He married former model Carla Germaine in December 2002 in [[North Warwickshire]]; the pair met when Kyle was presenting on a [[BRMB]] radio show and Germaine was a winning contestant to be a bride for a controversial ''[[Two Strangers and a Wedding]]'' contest hosted by the station.<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/page.cfm?objectid=16553747&method=full&siteid=50002 icBirmingham - Blind date wedding contest to return]</ref> They since have two daughters together named Alice (born January 2004) and Ava (born October 2005).
