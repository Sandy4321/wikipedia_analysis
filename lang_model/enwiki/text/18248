'''Hannah Woolley''', sometimes spelled '''Wolley''', (born 1622, England - died circa 1675, England) was a writer who published early  books on [[household management]] and was probably the first to earn their living doing this.<ref name="Hobby">Hobby</ref>

==Life==
Her mother and elder sisters were all skilled in "Physick and Chirurgery" and she learned from them . Nothing is known of her father.<ref name="DNB">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref>

From 1639 to 1646 Wolley worked as a servant for an unnamed woman, almost certainly Anne, Lady Maynard (d. 1647),  during which time she learned about medical remedies and recipes.<ref name="Hobby"/>

She married Jerome Woolley, a schoolmaster, in 1646 and ran with him a free [[grammar school]] at [[Newport, Essex|Newport]], in Essex.<ref name="Brooklyn">Brooklyn Museum</ref> This is very near the Maynard family's house at [[Little Easton]].<ref name="DNB"/> In the school she put into practice her skills at "physick".<ref name="Hobby"/>

A few years later, the Woolleys opened a school in [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London.<ref name="Brooklyn"/>  She had at least four sons and two daughters, and the marriage was remembered by Hannah as a happy one.<ref name="DNB"/>

Hannah was widowed in 1661 and from that year on began publishing books on household management. She covered such topics as : recipes, notes on domestic management, embroidery instruction, the etiquette of letter writing, medicinal advice, and  perfume making. These proved to be very popular.<ref name="Brooklyn"/> 

Her first book '' The Ladies Directory'' was published at her own expense in 1661, and this was soon reprinted in 1664. Her second book ''The Cooks Guide'', was  printed at a her publisher's expense and is dedicated to Maynard's daughter, Lady Anne Wroth (1632<U+2013>1677), and her own daughter Mary.<ref name="DNB"/> 

Wolley earned a reputation as a successful physician, despite her amateur status and the unwelcoming environment for female medical practitioners at that time in history.<ref name="Hobby"/> She used her books as an advertisement for her skills and invited her readers to consult her in person.

Wolley remarried in 1666  at [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]], to Francis Challiner, a widower two years older than herself.  But her second husband died before February 1669.<ref name="DNB"/>

Wolley's own date of death is unknown. She did not react, as she had done previously, to another [[Plagiarism|plagiarised]] work of  1675 called '' The Accomplish'd Ladies Delight'' so it is likely that she did not live to see it appear.<ref name="Hobby"/>
