'''Kingsmead Square''' in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England was laid out by [[John Strahan]] in the 1730s. Many of the houses are [[listed building]]s.

Number 12, 13 and 14 is made up of Rosewell House, which forms one building with Numbers 1 and 2 Kingsmead Street. The house is named after T Rosewell, who commissioned it from Strahan and whose sign, a rose and a well, can be seen on the [[baroque]] facade<ref>{{cite book|last=Gadd|first=David|title=Georgain Summer|publisher=Adams and Dart|location=Bath|date=1971|pages=51<U+2013>52|chapter=III The making of Georgian Bath|isbn=239000838}}</ref> with the date 1736.
