'''''American Life''''' is the ninth [[studio album]] by [[United States|American]] singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], released on [[April 22]], [[2003]] by [[Maverick Records]]. Worldwide, the album has sold 4 million copies. It was her last studio album to be released under her contract with [[Maverick (entertainment company)|Maverick]].

==Album information==
''American Life'' was mostly composed and entirely produced by Madonna and [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]]. The two had previously collaborated together on the studio album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' (2000). Other songwriting collaborators on the album were Monte Pittman, [[Stuart Price]], [[United Kingdom|British]] singer-songwriter [[Jem Griffiths]] and [[Guy Sigsworth]] who had previously worked on the song "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]" from the ''Music'' album. Composer [[Michel Colombier]] also collaborated after he previously worked with her on some of the string-arrangements on ''Music'' and "[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]." Colombier is responsible for all the string-arrangements on ''American Life'' and conducted "Easy Ride", "Nothing Fails" and "Die Another Day". 

Madonna started recording the album in 2002 after filming the movie ''[[Swept Away (2002 film)|Swept Away]]''. While recording the album in [[London, England]], she also worked on other projects such as her West-End appearance in the play ''Up For Grabs'' and filming her cameo-appearance in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Die Another Day]]''.  Recording of the album was finished in London and [[Los Angeles]] in late 2002. 

Madonna later promoted the album with the remix EP ''[[Remixed & Revisited]]'' and the 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]].

==Title, cover and direction==
One of the first rumoured titles of the album was ''[[Ein Sof (Kabbalah)|Ein Sof]]'', which Madonna had mentioned in an interview with [[Larry King]] in October 2002 during the promotion for ''Swept Away''. "Ein Sof" is [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and means "no end". In early 2003 it was revealed that the working title for the album was ''Hollywood'' (a song on the album) until the final title ''American Life'' was confirmed on [[February 10]], [[2003]].

In mid-January 2003 in Los Angeles the photo shoot for the album was done by photographer [[Craig McDean]]. McDean had already worked with Madonna for the portfolio for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in October 2002. According to unconfirmed reports the photo shoot cost $415,000. It had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark greens and blacks, combat boots and with guns. Her hair was dyed dark brown and on the cover of the album Madonna is wearing a beret and is almost a copy of the [[Che Guevara (photo)|famous image of revolutionary Che Guevara]]. Because of the paramilitary theme, the dyed hair and the artistic composition, some see a parallel between the album cover and the infamous news photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress [[Patty Hearst]].

The [[France|French]] design-team M/M Paris were responsible for the artwork of ''American Life''. M/M Paris is a partnership between Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak. The duo are perhaps best known for their collaborations with Icelandic pop singer [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]].

==Downloads and website hack==
To counter illegal Internet downloads of the album's songs both before and after the album's release, Madonna's associates created a number of false song-files of similar length and size. Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" followed by minutes of silence. Other dummy files included Madonna quasi-rapping, "Thought you'd sneak past me, didn't you? Thought you'd get by me, now didn't you?" and an endless loop of the line "I'm drinking a soy latte, I get a double shot<U+00E9>, it goes right through my body and you know I'm satisfied" from the track "American Life".

However, this only served to throw down the gauntlet to some; Madonna's website was hacked, with a message appearing on the front saying "This is what the fuck I think I'm doing...", followed by download links for each of the album's songs.<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/madonnasplash1.html The Smoking Gun: Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Commercial reception==
The release of the album started a commercial slump for Madonna in the United States, despite the fact that the debut single "[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]" from that album - although not seen by Madonna herself as the debut - was a top ten hit.  The album suffered commercially, in part due to controversy over the first proper single "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]". The anti-war content of its music video was interpreted as being unpatriotic, making Madonna withdraw its release for American music channels. She issued a statement saying she did so because she believed it was not appropriate to air it at that time, and that she did not want to risk offending anyone who could misinterpret its meaning. 

The album received mixed reviews upon its release, and it earned the lowest sales of any Madonna album to date, both in the United States and in the rest of the world. ''American Life'' debuted at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 241,000 copies sold in its first week; it was her second consecutive number-one debut, and her fifth number-one overall in the United States. It also peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom, were it sold 300,000 copies, and at the [[United World Chart]], with 4 million copies shifted.<ref>[http://www.absolutemadonna.com/charts/albumstats.shtml Madonna Album Charts and Statistics]</ref><ref>[http://www.world4madonna.com/charts/ Madonna charts and sale figures]</ref>

The second single, "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]", failed to chart in the Hot 100, becoming Madonna's first single in twenty years not to do so. Some claim this happened because many American radio stations refused to play Madonna because of the controversy around the original video for the previous single. The song was a top-five hit in Argentina, Canada, Italy, United Kingdom and on the United World Chart. The next single, "[[Nothing Fails]]", also failed to chart in the United States. It peaked in the top-ten in Argentina, Canada, Ireland, Italy and Spain. "Love Profusion", the album's final single, peaked in the top-ten only in Canada, Greece and Italy. It missed the top-ten of the UK Singles Chart by just one place. Beside the flop of all the other singles in the United States, the promotional releases "[[Nobody Knows Me]]" and "[[Mother and Father]]" became very successful in American clubs, peaking high on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.

Despite the fact that only two songs featured in ''American Life'' - "Die Another Day" and "American Life" -  charted in the Hot 100 chart, the album proved to be a success on the dance charts. It is the only album in history to provide seven top-ten hits on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart.
