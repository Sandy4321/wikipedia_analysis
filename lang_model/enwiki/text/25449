'''Marianta Pieridi''' (Greek: <U+039C><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1> <U+03A0><U+03B9><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03B7>) is a popular Greek singer who has had much success in Greece's music industry.

==Career==
===Eurovision===
Marianta got her first real break into in the music industry during the [[1995 Eurovision Song Contest]] that took place in [[Dublin, Ireland]]. She was the backing vocalist of the Greek entry to the contest performed by [[Elina Konstantopoulou]]. They sang the song "Pia Prosefhi" ("What Kind Of A Prayer"). After Eurovision, Marianta performed with many popular singers including [[Despina Vandi]], [[Antonis Remos]], and [[Giannis Parios]] getting her name and voice known.

===2002-present===
In June of 2002, Marianta released her first album, titled "I Gynaika Tis Zois Sou" ("The Woman Of Your Life") a success which rocketed her into the greek music mainstream. The same year at the Arion Greek Music Awards she received the award for "Best Newcomer in Greek Music."

July of 2003 marked the release of Marianta's first single titled "Oute Ki Esi" ("Neither You",) and the album "Vale Fantasia" ("Use Your Imagination") was realeased three months later in October. 

In the following years Marianta went on to release two more albums each with its own flair. "Abra Katabra" ("Hocus Pocus") contained songs with a strong dance beat while "Sfaira Stin Kardia"("Bullet In The Heart") contained more Greek beat with a mix of pop and [[laika]] elements incorporated into the songs.

In September 2006, Marianta returned with the single "DJ", containing a powerful dance song of the same name. It is a remake of [[Swedish]] singer [[Carola H<U+00E4>ggkvist]]'s "Stanna Eller Ga". The lyrics of all of the songs on the cd are signed off for the first time by Marianta herself. A few days after the release of the single, Marianta released her first "best of" album, featuring the greatest hits of her career. It was titled "DJ - The Hits Collection"
