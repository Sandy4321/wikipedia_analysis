'''Erhard Ratdolt''' (1442<U+2013>1528) was an early German printer from [[Augsburg]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Flowers of Abu Ma'shar|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2997|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> He was active as a printer in [[Venice]] from 1476 to 1486, and afterwards in Augsburg.  From 1475<ref name=WDL1/> to 1478 he was in partnership with two other German printers<ref name=WDL1/>. 

The first book the partnership produced was the ''Calendarium'' (1476), written and previously published by [[Regiomontanus]], which offered one of the earliest examples of a modern title page. Other noteworthy publications are the ''Historia Romana'' of [[Appianus]] (1477), and the first edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' (1482), where he solved the problem of printing geometric diagrams, the ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'', also from 1482, [[Haly Abenragel]] (1485),<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9540/ |title = Complete Book on the Judgment of the Stars |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1523 |accessdate = 2013-07-14 }}</ref> and [[Alchabitius]] (1503). Ratdolt is also famous for having produced the first known printer's type specimen book (in this instance a broadsheet displaying the fonts with which he might print).<ref>{{cite book|last=Updike|first=Daniel Berkeley|title=Printing Types, Their History, Forms, and Use|year=1922 reprinted  2009|publisher=General Books|isbn=978-1-151-43738-9|pages=196}}</ref>

His innovations of layout and typography, mixing type and [[woodcut]]s, have subsequently been much admired. His graphic choices and technical solutions influenced also those of [[William Morris]].<ref>"Erhard Ratdolt." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition (2010): 1. Academic Search Complete.
