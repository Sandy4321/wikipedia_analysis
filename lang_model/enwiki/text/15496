Designed by [[William R. Walker & Son]] and constructed by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched [[hipped roof]]. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out and has two porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows on the sides of the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.<ref name="NRHP" />

== Significance ==
The Fifth Ward Wardroom is historically significant as a historical reminder of the pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town-meeting form of governance. The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building, wardrooms, and is one of three extant examples in Rhode Island. [[William R. Walker & Son]] constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the [[First Ward Wardroom]] being extant and the third example having been demolished.<ref name="NRHP" /> Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son, the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related, but not identical in construction and show variations by the firm.<ref name="NRHP" /> Another wardroom, with a bungalow style, is located in the [[Cato Hill Historic District]] in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/woonsocket/woon_woonsocket-multiple-resource-nomination.pdf | title=Historic Resource of Woonsocket, Rhode Island: Partial Inventory, Historic and Architectural Resources | publisher=National Park Service | date=1976 | accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> The Fifth Ward Wardroom was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.<ref name="nris" />
