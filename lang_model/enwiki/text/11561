'''Crowland''' (modern usage) or '''Croyland''' (medieval era name and the one still in ecclesiastical use) is a small town in south [[Lincolnshire]], England, positioned between [[Peterborough]] and [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], with two sites of historical interest.

==Geography==
From 1894 the parish, being the only part of the [[Peterborough Rural Sanitary District]] in Lincolnshire, formed its own Crowland [[Rural District]]. This was merged into [[Spalding Rural District]] under a [[Local Government Act 1929|County Review Order]] in the 1930s. It has formed part of the [[South Holland, Lincolnshire|South Holland]] district since April 1974.

Crowland falls within the drainage area of the Welland and Deepings [[Internal Drainage Board]].<ref>[http://www.wellandidb.org.uk/ Welland and Deepings IDB]</ref>

Crowland is nearer to the outskirts of Peterborough than Spalding, and (similar to other settlements of the Welland) is less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} north of the Lincolnshire boundary with the City of Peterborough. The main road is the [[A16 road (England)|A16]], which provides connections with Spalding to the north and Peterborough to the south (via  the [[A47 road|A47]]). The east-west B1166 connects with [[Deeping St. James]] [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1169214 along] the north side of the Welland to the west and Holbeach Drove to the east, and [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]] is accessed via the B1040 to the south-east.

The civil parish extends south as far as Kennulph's Drain. This is the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/599868 boundary] with a small section of [[Newborough, Cambridgeshire|Newborough]], which encompasses the parish adjacent south, that of [[Borough Fen, Cambridgeshire|Borough Fen]]. The A16 crosses the former A1073 (now an unclassified local road) from east to west just south of the Alderlands farm and campsite. The parish boundary follows a drain westwards and the A16 between Kennulph's Farm and Poplar's Farm. It follows Speechley Drove to the north and to the west of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/132937 Eardley Grange], bordering Borough Fen. It crosses the east-west Corporation Bank and then borders [[Peakirk, Cambridgeshire|Peakirk]] for a few hundred yards.

At Kennulph's Stone, it no longer borders Peterborough but [[South Kesteven]] and the parish of Deeping St. James for about {{Convert|220|yd|m}}. On the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/443654 north side] of the Welland, to the west of Wards Farm, and on the B1166, it no longer borders South Kesteven, but the parish of [[Deeping St. Nicholas]] (in South Holland). The boundary follows [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/588132 Raisen's Dyke] to the north, crossing Crowland Common. The north-west corner of the parish has a {{convert|440|yd|m}} section of the [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line]].

The boundary follows eastwards, to the south, South Drove Drain and just to the north of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1162148 Peacock's Farm] and Law's Farm. The boundary [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/364465 crosses] the Welland, then follows the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/593558 New River] to the east, to the north of Cloot House and Bank House Farm. To the north of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/593632 St Guthlac's Cross], it meets Spalding Road (former A1073) and borders [[Cowbit]], and follows the north side of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/592490 Queen's Bank], crossing the A16. Just south of here, to the west of Spalding Road, is [[Crowland Airfield]], home of a [[gliding]] club. For {{convert|880|yd|m}} north of [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/338050 Queen's Bank Farm], it borders the large parish of [[Weston Hills|Weston]]. Eastwards across to Middlemoor Farm, it borders [[Moulton, Lincolnshire|Moulton]]. From the area south of Little Postland, it borders the large parish of [[Whaplode]] ([[Whaplode Drove]]). 

It crosses the B1166 at Shepeau Stow, which includes a few houses in the parish on the west side of Back Bank, although the village is part of Whaplode parish. The area, in the parish, to the west of here was known as [[Great Postland]]. The boundary follows [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/593222 Dowsdale Bank], and just north of Dowsdale Plantation, the parish [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/593248 meets] the City of Peterborough, and the parish of Thorney at the Lincolnshire-Peterborough boundary. It follows the [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/62832 Old South Eau] under Fall's Bridge, near Empson's Farm. A footpath follows the boundary to where it crosses the B1040 at Nene Terrace, following the west side of the B1040 for {{convert|330|yd|m}} where it meets the (Peterborough) parish of Newborough.

===Nature reserve===
Th Crowland Ponds Nature Reserve is north of the town, next to the west side of the Welland.

The town's two historical points of interest are the unique 14th-century three-sided bridge, [[Trinity Bridge (Crowland)|Trinity Bridge]], which stands at its central point and used to be the confluence of three streams; and the other is its ruined medieval [[Croyland Abbey]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/towns/crowland.asp |title=Crowland Tourist Information |accessdate=2009-05-07 |publisher=Excelsior Information Systems Limited }}</ref> which was dedicated to [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary the Virgin]], [[Saint Bartholomew]] and [[Saint Guthlac]] in the eighth century. The ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.r3.org/bookcase/croyland/croy1.html |title=Croyland Chronicle |accessdate=2009-05-07 |first= INGULPH'S CHRONICLE OF THE ABBEY OF CROYLAND |coauthors=Translated by HENRY T. RILEY, Esq., B.A., |publisher= Richard III Society Online Library }}</ref> an important source for medieval historians, is believed to be the work of some of the monastery's inhabitants.

In about 701 a monk named [[Guthlac]] came to what was then an island  in the Fens to live the life of a hermit. Following in Guthlac<U+2019>s footsteps, a monastic community came into being here. Marshland beside the island was drained and a town gradually grew up near the abbey.

The town was captured after a short siege by [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces in 1643.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boar.org.uk/ariwxo3FNQ761.htm|title=a ''Fenland Notes and Queries''; April 1899, article on a piece of Parliamentarian propaganda.}}</ref>

The [[Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway]] crossed the north-east part of the parish until the 1980s. It passed near De Key's Farm to the east and Martin's Farm to the north. [[Postland railway station]] was near Postland House.

==Education==
The town currently has two schools, [[South View]] primary school, and [[University Academy Holbeach]] Crowland Site, a co-educational [[academy]]. 

Crowland's secondary school was originally named The St Guthlac School after the abbey's founder, is situated at the junction of the [[B1166 road|B1166]] and [[B1040 road|B1040]]. Crowland school pupils have the option of single sex [[grammar school]] education ten miles away at Spalding, and sixth form students attend other schools, again at Spalding or at Deeping St James.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Lincolnshire Country Council made the decision at the begin of July 2011 that The St Guthlac School will close as part of the creation of the [[University Academy Holbeach]], to be situated on the site of the former George Farmer Technology and Language College in Holbeach. Education4Crowland, a group of residents and members of the Parish, District and County Councils, has been formed to help fight for the retention of secondary education within the town and the creation of a Free School.<ref>[http://www.education4crowland.co.uk/ Education4Crowland website]</ref>
