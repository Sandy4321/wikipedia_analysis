'''Zygmunt Szendzielarz''' (also known as "'''<U+0141>upaszka'''"; 12 March 1910 <U+2013> 8 February 1951) was commander of the [[Poland|Polish]] 5th [[Home Army 5th Wilno Brigade|Wilno]] [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] Brigade.

==Early life==
Szendzielarz was born in [[Stryj]] (now in [[Lviv Oblast]]), then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], into the family of a railway worker. After graduating from primary school in Lw<U+00F3>w, he attended a biological-mathematical ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in Lw<U+00F3>w and then in Stryj. After graduating, he volunteered for the [[Polish Army]] and completed Infantry [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] School in [[Ostr<U+00F3>w Mazowiecka]] (1932), then Cavalry NCO School in [[Grudzi<U+0105>dz]]. He was promoted to lieutenant and transferred to [[Wilno]], where he assumed command of a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] in the 4th Uhlan Regiment.

==World War II==
With his unit he took part in the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September Campaign]]. His unit was attached to the [[Wilenska Brygada Kawalerii|Wilno Cavalry Brigade]] under General [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Anders]], part of the [[Prusy Army]]. After retreating from northern Poland, the forces of Gen. Anders fought their way towards the city of Lw<U+00F3>w and the [[Romanian Bridgehead]]. However, in the area of [[Lublin]] Szendzielarz's unit was surrounded and suffered heavy losses. Soon afterwards Szendzielarz was taken [[prisoner of war]] by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], but he managed to escape to Lw<U+00F3>w, where he lived for a short period under a false name. He tried to cross the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border to escape from Poland and reach the Polish Army being formed in France, but he failed and finally moved with his family to Wilno.

In Wilno, Szendzielarz started working on various posts under false names. In mid-1943 he joined the [[Home Army]] under the [[nom de guerre]] ''<U+0141>upaszko'', and in August he started organizing his own partisan group in the forests surrounding the city. Soon the unit was joined by local volunteers and the remnants of a unit of [[Antoni Burzynski|Antoni Burzy<U+0144>ski "Kmicic"]], destroyed by [[Soviet Partisans]] and the [[Wehrmacht]]. By September, the unit was 700 men strong and was officially named the V Vilnian Home Army Brigade (''V Wile<U+0144>ska Brygada Armii Krajowej'').

''<U+0141>upaszko's'' unit fought against the German army and [[SS]] units in the area of southern [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926<U+2013>1939)|Wilno Voivodeship]], but was also frequently attacked by the Soviet Partisans paradropped in the area by the [[Red Army]]. In April 1944, Zygmunt Szendzielarz was arrested by the Lithuanian police and handed over to the [[Gestapo]]. <U+0141>upaszko was free in the same month under circumstances that remain unclear. In reprisal actions his brigade captured several dozen German officials and sent several threatening letters to Gestapo but it remains unknown if and how these contributed to his release.

==Ostra Brama==
In August, the commander of all Home Army units in the Wilno area, Gen. [[Aleksander Krzy<U+017C>anowski|Aleksander "Wilk" Krzy<U+017C>anowski]], ordered all six brigades under his command to prepare for [[Operation Tempest]] <U+2014> a planned all-national rising against the German forces occupying Poland. In what became known as [[Operation Ostra Brama]], Brigade V was to attack the Wilno suburb of [[Zwierzyniec]] in cooperation with advancing units of the [[3rd Belorussian Front]]. However, <U+0141>upaszko, for fear of being arrested with his units by the [[NKVD]] and killed on the spot, disobeyed orders and moved his unit to central Poland.  Wilno was liberated by Polish and Soviet forces, and the Polish commander was then arrested by the Soviets and the majority of his men were sent to [[Gulag]]s and sites of detention in the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

It is uncertain why Szendzielarz was not court-martialed for desertion. Probably it was in fact General "Wilk" himself who removed <U+0141>upaszko's unit from the Wilno area, due to <U+0141>upaszko long having been involved in fighting with Soviet partisans and to Wilk not wanting to provoke the [[Red Army]]. Regardless, after crossing into the [[Podlasie]] and [[Bia<U+0142>ystok]] area in October, the brigade continued the struggle against withdrawing Germans in the ranks of the Bia<U+0142>ystok Home Army Area. After the region was overrun by the Soviets, <U+0141>upaszko's unit remained in the forests and he decided to await the outcome of Russo-Polish talks held by the [[Polish Government in Exile]]. Meanwhile the unit was reorganized and captured enough equipment to fully arm 600 men with machine guns and machine pistols.

==After the war==
After the governments of the United Kingdom and United States broke the pacts with Poland and accepted the so-called [[PKWN]] as the provisional government of Poland, <U+0141>upaszka restarted the hostilities - this time against a new oppressor, in the ranks of [[Wolno<U+015B><U+0107> i Niezawis<U+0142>o<U+015B><U+0107>]] organization. However, after several successful actions against the NKVD units in the area of [[Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a Forest]], it became apparent that such actions would result in a total destruction of his unit.

In September 1945, Zygmunt Szendzielarz moved with a large part of his unit to [[Gda<U+0144>sk]]-[[Oliwa]], where he remained underground while preparing his unit for a new partisan offensive against the Soviet-backed communist authorities of Poland. On April 14, 1946, Szendzielarz finally mobilized his unit and headed for the [[Tuchola Forest]], where he started operations against the forces of the [[Internal Security Corps]], [[Urz<U+0105>d Bezpiecze<U+0144>stwa]] and the communist authorities. <U+0141>upaszko was hoping that in the spring of 1946 the former Western Allies of Poland would start a new war against the Soviet Union and that the Polish underground units could prove useful in liberating Poland. However, when he realized that no such war was planned he decided to disband his unit. He saw further fight as a waste of blood of his men and decided to retire from open fight against the communists.

After several years underground, he was arrested by the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|UB]] on June 28, 1948, in Osielec near [[Nowy Targ]]. After more than two years of brutal interrogation and torture in [[Warsaw]]'s [[Mokot<U+00F3>w Prison]] he was sentenced to death on November 2, 1950 by the Soviet-controlled court martial in Warsaw. He was executed on February 8, 1951, together with several other Home Army soldiers. Szendzielarz was 40 years old.

==Posthumous==
After <U+0141>upaszko's death, communist propaganda accused him of all sorts of crimes, from crimes against humanity, robbery and common theft to membership in ''[[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} 

In 1988 Szendzielarz was posthumously promoted to ''[[rotmistrz]]'' and awarded the ''[[Virtuti Militari]]'', Poland's highest military decoration, by [[Kazimierz Sabbat]], the [[President of Poland]] in exile.

After the fall of the communism, in 1993, Szendzielarz was [[rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] and declared innocent of charges which he had been accused of.<ref>[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/18/2614/PRZEGLAD_MEDIOW__1418_czerwca_2003_r.html IPN, Przeglad Mediow]</ref> On 2007 Polish president [[Lech Kaczy<U+0144>ski]] posthumously awarded Szendzielarz with the order of [[Polonia Restituta]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071113142016/http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/1639041,11,item.html Prezydent odznaczy<U+0142> "<U+017C>o<U+0142>nierzy wykl<U+0119>tych"] 11.11.2007 </ref>
