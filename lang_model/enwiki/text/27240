'''''Louis Lambert''''' is an 1832 novel by [[French people|French]] novelist and playwright [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]] (1799<U+2013>1850), included in the ''<U+00C9>tudes philosophiques'' section of his [[novel sequence]] ''[[La Com<U+00E9>die humaine]]''. Set mostly in a school at [[Vend<U+00F4>me]], it examines the life and theories of a boy genius fascinated by the Swedish philosopher [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].

Published under a variety of titles, ''Louis Lambert'' contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not considered an important example of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] style for which he became famous, the novel is cited frequently as an important look at the details of Balzac's own childhood.

These details combine with events from the author's life <U+2013> including punishment from teachers and social [[ostracism]] <U+2013> to create in the novel a fictionalized [[autobiography]]. An important essay referenced in the novel, ''Trait<U+00E9> de la Volont<U+00E9>'' ("Treatise on the Will"), was in fact composed by Balzac as a student. It examines the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although the author did not explore many of the metaphysical elements in the story until much later in his life. Concepts analyzed in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of [[angels]] and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.

Although critics panned the novel, Balzac remained steadfast in his belief that it provided an important look at philosophy and metaphysics. As he developed the scheme for ''La Com<U+00E9>die humaine'', he placed it in the ''Etudes philosophiques'' section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel ''S<U+00E9>raph<U+00EE>ta'', about an [[androgynous]] angelic creature.

== Background ==

By 1832, [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]] had begun to make a name for himself as a writer. The second of five children, Balzac was sent to the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]] College de [[Vend<U+00F4>me]] at the age of eight.<ref>Robb, p. 12; Maurois, p. 29.</ref> He returned from the school six years later, sickly and weak. He was taught by tutors and private schools for two and a half years, then attended the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]]. After working in the law for three years, he moved into a tiny [[garret]] in 1819 and began writing.<ref>Robb, pp. 27<U+2013>53.</ref>

His first efforts, published under a variety of pseudonyms, were cheaply-printed [[potboiler]] novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, entitled ''[[Les Chouans]]''; it was a minor success, even though it did not earn the author enough money to escape his considerable debt.<ref>Robb, pp. 145-174.</ref> He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including ''La Physiologie du mariage'' (1829), ''[[Sarrasine]]'' (1830), and ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'' (1831).<ref>Robb, pp. 162<U+2013>186; Maurois, pp. 155<U+2013>180.</ref> 

In 1831 Balzac published a short story called "Les Proscrits" ("The Exiles"), about two poets named Dante and Godefroid de Gand, attending the Sorbonne at the start of the fourteenth century. It explores questions of [[metaphysics]] and [[mysticism]], particularly the spiritual quest for [[illuminism]] and enlightenment. Balzac had been influenced greatly as a young man by the Swedish philosopher [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], whose theories permeate "Les Proscrits".<ref>Hunt, p. 37; Dedinsky, p. 45; Oliver, pp. 112<U+2013>113.</ref> The story was published as part of an 1831 collection entitled the ''Romans et contes philosophiques'' ("Philosophical novels and stories").<ref>Saintsbury, p. xii.</ref>

== Writing and publication ==

In May 1832, Balzac suffered a head injury when his [[Tilbury (carriage)|tilbury]] crashed in a Parisian street. Although he was not hurt badly, he wrote to a friend about his worry that "some of the cogs in the mechanism of my brain may have got out of adjustment".<ref>Maurois, p. 195.</ref> His doctor ordered him to rest and refrain from writing or other mental activities. When he had recuperated, he spent the summer at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Sach<U+00E9>]], just outside the city of [[Tours]], with a family friend, Jean de Margonne.<ref>Maurois, pp. 195<U+2013>196; Robb, p. 201.</ref>

[[Image:Chateau Sache.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Balzac wrote ''Louis Lambert'' while staying at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Sach<U+00E9>]], near [[Tours]].]]

While in Sach<U+00E9>, he wrote a short novel called ''Notice biographique sur Louis Lambert'' about a misfit boy genius interested in mysticism and philosophy. Like "Les Proscrits", ''Louis Lambert'' was a vehicle for Balzac to explore the philosophy which had fascinated him, particularly the ideas of Swedenborg and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]]. He hoped the work would "produce an effect of incontestable superiority"<ref>Maurois, p. 199.</ref> and provide "a glorious rebuttal" to critics who ridiculed his interest in metaphysics.<ref>Robb, p. 201.</ref>

The novel was first published as part of the ''Nouveaux contes philosophiques'' in late 1832, but by the start of the following year he declared it to be "a wretched miscarriage" and began rewriting it.<ref>Maurois, p. 221.</ref> During the process, Balzac was aided by a grammarian working as a proofreader, who found "a thousand errors" in the text. Once he'd returned home, the author "cried with despair and with that rage that takes hold of you when you recognize your faults after working so hard".<ref>Robb, pp. 235<U+2013>236.</ref>

A vastly expanded and revised novel, ''Histoire intellectuelle de L.L.'', was published as a single volume in 1833. Still unsatisfied, Balzac continued reworking the text <U+2013> as he often did between editions <U+2013> and included a series of letters written by the boy genius, as well as a detailed description of his metaphysical theories. This final edition was released as ''Louis Lambert'', included with "Les Proscrits" and a later work, ''S<U+00E9>raph<U+00EE>ta'', in a volume entitled ''Le Livre mystique'' ("The Mystical Book").<ref>Bertault, p. 73; Saintsbury, p. xii.</ref>

== Plot summary ==

The novel begins with an overview of the main character's background. Louis Lambert, the only child of a [[tanning|tanner]] and his wife, is born in 1797 and begins reading at an early age. In 1811 he meets [[Anne Louise Germaine de Sta<U+00EB>l|Madame de Sta<U+00EB>l]], who <U+2013> struck by his intellect <U+2013> pays for him to enroll in the Coll<U+00E8>ge de Vend<U+00F4>me. There he meets the narrator, a boy named "the Poet" who later identifies himself in the text as the author; they quickly become friends.<ref>Balzac, p. 183. Referring to a work by Rapha<U+00EB>l de Valentin in ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'', Balzac writes: "It was in memory of the disaster that befell Louis' book that, in the tale which comes first in these ''Etudes [philosophoiques]'', I adopted the title invented by Lambert for a work of fiction...."</ref>  Shunned by the other students and berated by teachers for not paying attention, the boys bond through discussions of philosophy and mysticism.

After completing an essay entitled ''Trait<U+00E9> de la Volont<U+00E9>'' ("Treatise on the Will"), Lambert is horrified when a teacher confiscates it, calls it "rubbish", and <U+2013> the narrator speculates <U+2013> sell is to a local grocer. Soon afterwards, a serious illness forces the narrator to leave the school. In 1815, Lambert graduates at the age of eighteen and lives for three years in [[Paris]]. After returning to his uncle's home in [[Blois]], he meets a woman named Pauline de Villenoix and falls passionately in love with her. On the day before their wedding, however, he suffers a mental breakdown and attempts to [[castration|castrate]] himself.<ref>Balzac, p. 242<U+2013>243. The uncle explains: "I watched him with the care of a mother for her child, and found him preparing to perform on himself the operation to which [[Origen]] believed he owed his talents."</ref>

Declared "incurable" by doctors, Lambert is ordered into solitude and rest. Pauline takes him to her family's ch<U+00E2>teau, where he lives in a near [[coma]]. Ignorant of these events, the narrator meets Lambert's uncle by chance, and is given a series of letters. Written by Lambert while in Paris and Blois, they continue his philosophical musings and describe his love for Pauline. The narrator visits his old friend at the Villenoix ch<U+00E2>teau, where the decrepit Lambert says only: "The angels are white."<ref>Balzac, p. 247.</ref> Pauline shares a series of statements her lover had dictated, and Lambert dies on [[25 September]] [[1824]] at the age of twenty-eight.

== Style ==

The actual events of ''Louis Lambert'' are minor, sprinkled between extended disucssions of philosophy, metaphysics, and human emotion. Because it does not employ the same sort of [[realism (arts)|realism]] for which Balzac became famous, it has been called one of "the most diffuse and least valuable of his works".<ref>Oliver, p. 25. Oliver disagrees with this sentiment.</ref> The novel emphasizes thought, particularly its expression among young thinkers and in written forms.<ref>Oliver, p. 25; Dedinksy, pp. 76<U+2013>77.</ref> Many critics, however, condemn the author's disorganized style and placement of his own matured philosophies into the mind of a teenage boy.<ref>Affron, p. 122; Hunt, p. 52; Maurois, p. 198<U+2013>199; Oliver, p. 26. Affron calls the novel "an illuminating mistake".</ref>

[[Image:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Louis Lambert's ability to feel himself present at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (depicted here in a painting by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois G<U+00E9>rard]]) reflects Balzac's own use of [[realism (arts)|realism]].]]

Still, shades of Balzac's realism are found in the book, particularly in the first-hand descriptions of the Coll<U+00E8>ge de Vend<U+00F4>me. The first part of the novel is packed with details about the school, from the inspection of quarters to the complex social rules for exchanging dishes at dinnertime.<ref>Balzac, pp. 154<U+2013>155; Robb, pp. 13<U+2013>15.</ref> Punishments are also described at length, including tedious writing tasks and the painful application of the [[Strap#Disciplinary_strapping|strap]]:<blockquote>Of all the physical torments to which we were exposed, certainly the most acute was that inflicted by this leathern instrument, about two fingers wide, applied to our poor little hands with all the strength and all the fury of the administrator. To endure this classical form of correction, the victim knelt in the middle of the room. He had to leave his form and go to kneel down near the master's desk under the curious and generally merciless eyes of his fellows.... Some boys cried out and shed bitter tears before or after the application of the strap; others accepted the infliction with stoic calm&nbsp;... but few could control an expression of anguish in anticipation.<ref>Balzac, pp. 169<U+2013>170.</ref></blockquote>Additional echoes of Balzac's realism appear when Lambert describes his ability to vicariously experience events through thought alone. In one extended passage, he describes reading about the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] and seeing "every incident". In another he approximates the physical pain of a knife cutting his skin by thinking about it. As Balzac's biographer Andr<U+00E9> Maurois notes, these reflections provide insight into the author's perspective toward the world and its written representations.<ref>Balzac, p. 150 and 173; Maurois, p. 199.</ref>

== Themes ==

[[Image:Balzac1820s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Balzac, seen here in his mid-20s, describes Louis Lambert as "slightly built, nearly five feet in height", with "hair, of a fine, bright black in masses of curls".<ref>Balzac, p. 162.</ref>]]

=== Autobiography ===

Biographers and critics agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly-veiled version of the author, evidenced by numerous factual similarities between them.<ref>Robb, pp. 201<U+2013>202; Maurois, p. 199; Affron, pp. 114<U+2013>120; Oliver, pp. 24<U+2013>25.</ref> As a student at the Coll<U+00E8>ge de Vend<U+00F4>me, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant.<ref>Robb, p. 19.</ref> Like the title character, Balzac experienced a shaking of his faith at the time of his first [[Eucharist|communion]].<ref>Bertault, pp. vii and 72.</ref> Balzac read voraciously while in school, and <U+2013> like Lambert <U+2013> was often punished for misbehaving in class.<ref>Oliver, pp. 25<U+2013>26; Robb, pp. 14<U+2013>20.</ref> The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep [[pigeons]] and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the [[dormitories]].<ref>Oliver, p. 24; Balzac, pp. 154<U+2013>155.</ref>

Lambert's essay about philosophy and metaphysics, ''Trait<U+00E9> de la Volont<U+00E9>'' ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay himself as a boy, and <U+2013> as in the novel <U+2013> it was confiscated by an angry teacher.<ref>Robb, pp. 20<U+2013>21; Hunt, p. 49; Oliver, p. 29.</ref> Lambert's genius and philosophical erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception, like (in some ways) the title character's eventual madness.<ref>Maurois, p. 199; Robb, pp. 201<U+2013>207; Affron, pp. 113<U+2013>124; Oliver, p. 25. Robb indicates that Balzac may have suffered from [[paraphasia]].</ref>

The many letters in the novel written by Lambert are also based on Balzac's life. Not long after finishing the first version of the book, while infatuated with the Marquise de Castries, he sent to her a fragmented love letter which Lambert sends to his paramour Pauline.<ref>Robb, p. 213.</ref> Lambert's letters to his uncle about life in Paris from 1817 to 1820, meanwhile, mirror Balzac's own sentiments while attending the Sorbonne at the same time.<ref>Bertault, p. 73.</ref>

=== Swedenborg and metaphysics ===

[[Image:Emanuel Swedenborg full portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Emanuel Swedenborg|Emanuel Swedenborg's]] work, especially ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]'', profoundly influences the boy genius Louis Lambert.]]

The ideas of [[Sweden|Swedish]] philosopher [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (and his disciple [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]]) are central to ''Louis Lambert''. Madame de Sta<U+00EB>l is first impressed by Lambert when she finds him reading Swedenborg's metaphysical treatise ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''; the Swedish writer's ideas are reproduced in Lambert's own comments about mind, soul, and will. Primary among these is the division of the human into an "inward" and "outward" being. The outward being, subject to the forces of nature and studied by science, manifests itself in Lambert as the frail, frequently-sick boy. The inward being, meanwhile, contains what Lambert calls "the material substance of thought", and serves as the true life into which he gradually moves throughout the novel.<ref>Maurois, pp. 199<U+2013>200; Balzac, p. 151; Hunt, p. 48; Oliver, pp. 26<U+2013>27.</ref> 

These concepts are explored with relation to language, pain, memory, and dreams. When the students take a trip to the nearby Ch<U+00E2>teau de [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], for example, Lambert <U+2013> seeing it for the first time <U+2013> recalls vivid memories of the place from a dream. Believing his spirit visited the place while his body slept, he ascribes the experience to "a complete severance of my body and my inner being" and "some inscrutable locomotive faculty in the spirit with effects resembling those of locomotion in the body".<ref>Balzac, p. 180.</ref>

Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac tries in ''Louis Lambert'' to construct a viable theory to unify spirit and matter.<ref>Bertault, p. 75; Oliver, pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref> Young Lambert attempts this goal in his ''Trait<U+00E9> de la Volont<U+00E9>'', which <U+2013> having been confiscated by a teacher <U+2013> is described by the narrator:<blockquote>The word Will he used to connote&nbsp;... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.<ref>Balzac, p. 185.</ref></blockquote>These concepts are linked to Balzac's interest in [[Franz Mesmer]], who postulated the theory of [[animal magnetism]], a force flowing between and among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes a section of the ''Trait<U+00E9> de la Volont<U+00E9>'' which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.<ref>Balzac, p. 191; Hunt, p. 49; Oliver, p. 29.</ref>

=== Religion ===

Balzac's spiritual crisis at the time of his first communion led him to explore the question of evil and the first Christian thinkers. As the French critic Philippe Bertault points out, much of the mysticism in ''Louis Lambert'' is related to the mysticism of early [[Christianity]].<ref>Bertault, pp. 72<U+2013>75.</ref> In his letters, Lambert describes exploring the philosophies of Christianity, [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and [[Confucianism]], among others. Tracing the similarities through these traditions, he declares that Swedenborg "undoubtedly epitomizes all of the religions<U+2014>or rather the one religion<U+2014>of humanity".<ref>Balzac, pp. 218<U+2013>219.</ref> The same theory informs Balzac's efforts, here and elsewhere, to complement his Christian beliefs with occult mysticism and secular realism.<ref>Oliver, p. 30; Hunt, p. 52; Bertault, pp. 75<U+2013>76.</ref>

The church itself is a subject of Lambert's meditations, particularly with regard to the early [[Christian martyrs]]. The split between inward and outward realities, he suggests, serves to explain the ability of those being tortured and maimed to escape physical suffering through spiritual will.<ref>Oliver, p. 30; Bertault, p. 76; Maurois, p. 200.</ref> As Lambert says: "Do not the phenomena observed in almost every instance of the torments so heroically endured by the early Christians for the establishment of the faith, amply prove that Material force will never prevail against the force of Ideas or the Will of man?"<ref>Balzac, p. 200.</ref> This inward-outward split also serves to explain the [[Miracles attributed to Jesus]], whom Lambert considers a "perfect" representation of unity between the two beings.<ref>Bertault, p. 76; Balzac, p. 200.</ref>

[[Image:Ignatius.jpg|thumb|left|The ability of [[Christian martyrs]] <U+2013> like [[Ignatius of Antioch]], eaten by lions <U+2013> to escape suffering through faith is described by Louis Lambert as proof of his ''Treatise on the Will''.]]

The religious theme appears later in passages relating to [[angel]]s. Discussing the contents of Swedenborg's ''Heaven and Hell'', Lambert tries to convince the narrator of the existence of angels, described as "an individual in whom the inner being conquers the outer being".<ref>Balzac, p. 175.</ref> The boy genius himself is seen as an example of this process: his physical body withers and sickens, while his spiritual enlightenment expands, reaching its apex with his comment to the narrator: "The angels are white."<ref>Balzac, p. 247; Hunt, p. 51; Affron, p. 120.</ref> Pauline, meanwhile, is described as "the angel" and "Angel-woman".<ref>Balzac, p. 221 and 233, respectively.</ref> Their parallel angelic states merge into what critic Charles Affron calls "a kind of perfect marriage, a spiritual bond that traverses this world and the next".<ref>Affron, p. 123.</ref> Balzac later returned to the question of angels in other works of the ''<U+00C9>tudes philosophiques'', particularly ''S<U+00E9>raph<U+00EE>ta''.

=== Genius and madness ===

Convinced that he was himself a [[genius]], Balzac used ''Louis Lambert'' to explore the difficulty of genius individuals in society, as well as their frequent progression into [[insanity|madness]]. He had been troubled greatly when, at Vend<U+00F4>me, he watched a schoolmate's mental condition deteriorate severely.<ref>Robb, p. 16.</ref> Lambert's madness is represented most vividly in his attempt at self-[[castration]], followed by years spent in a catatonic state.<ref>Balzac, pp. 240<U+2013>243.</ref> This transformation is in many ways a byproduct of his genius; because his brilliance is condemned by teachers and incompatible with the society the other children, Lambert finds himself rejected by the world.<ref>Affron, pp. 115<U+2013>117.</ref> He finds no more success in Paris, where he was led to "eat my heart out in misery".<ref>Balzac, p. 207.</ref> He becomes a vegetable, removed from the physical world entirely.

As a reflection of Balzac himself, Lambert also embodies the author's self-image as a brilliant writer, while acknowledging suspicions about his mental health. Some of his stories and public statements <U+2013> as well as his fall prior to writing the novel <U+2013> had led some observers to question Balzac's sanity. The protagonist's madness in ''Louis Lambert'' only added weight to these claims. As biographer Graham Robb writes: "It was typical of Balzac to douse a fire with petrol."<ref>Robb, p. 201; Maurois, p. 195; Affron, pp. 122<U+2013>123.</ref>

== Reception and legacy ==

[[Image:La Com<U+00E9>die humaine 06.jpg|thumb|right|Balzac's novel-sequence ''[[La Com<U+00E9>die humaine]]'']]

Balzac was fiercely proud of ''Louis Lambert'' and believed it elegantly represented his diverse interests in philosophy, mysticism, religion, and occultism. When he sent an early draft to his lover at the time, however, she predicted the negative reception it would receive. "Let the whole world see you for themselves, my dearest," she wrote, "but do not cry out to them to admire you, because then the most powerful magnifying glasses will be directed at you, and what becomes of the most exquisite object when it is put under a microscope?"<ref>Letter from Madame de Berny to Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac, quoted in Maurois, p. 201.</ref> Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, due mostly to the book's lack of sustaining narrative.<ref>Maurois, p. 222; Affron, p. 122; Pugh, p. 29.</ref> Balzac was undeterred by the negative reactions; referring to ''Louis Lambert'' and the other works in ''Le Livre mystique'', he wrote: "Those are books that I create for myself and for a few others."<ref>Quoted in Bertault, p. 74.</ref>

While the three editions of ''Louis Lambert'' were being revised and published, Balzac was developing a scheme to organize all of his novels <U+2013> written and unwritten. He called the scheme ''[[La Com<U+00E9>die humaine]]'' ("The Human Comedy"), and envisioned it as a panoramic look at every part of French life at the time. He placed ''Louis Lambert'' in the section named ''Etudes philosophiques'' ("Philosophical Studies"), where it remained throughout his fifteen-year reorganization of the project.<ref>Dedinsky, pp. 78<U+2013>79.</ref> He returned to the themes of the novel in his later work ''S<U+00E9>raph<U+00EE>ta'', which follows the travails of an [[androgynous]] angelic creature.<ref>Hunt, pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref> Balzac also inserted Lambert and his lover Pauline into later works <U+2013> as he often did with characters from earlier novels <U+2013> most notably in the story "Un Drame au bord de la mer" ("A Drama at the Sea's Edge").<ref>Hunt, p. 135; Pugh, pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref>
