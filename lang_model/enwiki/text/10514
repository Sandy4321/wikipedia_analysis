'''''The Christmas Sessions''''' is the first [[Christmas music|Christmas album]] by American [[Christian rock]] band [[MercyMe]]. The album, produced by [[Brown Bannister]], was released on September 27, 2005. The band, who greatly enjoy Christmas, had previously recorded Christmas songs and enjoyed the process so much that they wanted to produce a full-length album. After releasing a studio album in early 2004, they decided to take time off; they realized they could record a Christmas album over that period and began work in December 2004. The band, aiming to produce a [[rock music|rock]]-oriented album, recruited Bannister, a noted rock producer, to produce it. In addition to one original song, "[[Joseph's Lullaby]]", the album consists of covers of both modern and traditional Christmas songs that the band members had listened to when growing up.

Upon its release, ''The Christmas Sessions'' received positive reviews from critics. Praise was offered for the album's production qualities, as well as the change in direction for MercyMe and the band's take on the traditional songs. Minor criticism was directed at lead vocalist [[Bart Millard]]'s vocals, as well as at individual songs. The album reached a peak of number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Christian Albums]] chart, number ten on the [[Top Holiday Albums|Holiday Albums]] chart, and number sixty-four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Multiple songs from the album appeared on record charts, including "Joseph's Lullaby", which peaked at number one on the [[Christian Songs]] chart; "[[God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen|God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]" and "[[The Little Drummer Boy|Little Drummer Boy]]" also appeared in the top ten on the chart, peaking at numbers nine and ten, respectively, and "[[Silent Night]]" reached a peak of number six on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart.

==Background and recording==
According to [[Bart Millard]], the lead vocalist for MercyMe, the band enjoys the Christmas season greatly and had recorded songs for compilation albums like ''[[WOW Christmas: Green]]'' and had liked the process of taking older Christmas songs and altering them; Millard said that the band "had so much fun doing it that we found ourselves wishing we had a Christmas record of our own".<ref name="Well Mercy Me, Children!">{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=John J.|title=Well Mercy Me, Children!|journal=[[CCM Magazine]]|year=2005|month=December|volume=28|issue=6|pages=24<U+2013>25|url=http://ht.salemweb.net/ccm/ccmmagazine/pdf/200512.pdf|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}</ref> After the band released their third studio album ''[[Undone (MercyMe album)|Undone]]'' in early 2004, they decided to take some time off, and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period. Although MercyMe had started as a [[rock music|rock]] band, they become associated with the [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] genre after their single "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]" became successful. In creating ''The Christmas Sessions'', the band incorporated more elements from [[rock music]] and other genres; Millard described it as "the most 'rock' album we've done" and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying "we didn<U+2019>t have to worry about which direction we went. We just made the record we wanted to make".<ref name="Well Mercy Me, Children!" />

MercyMe began recording the album over Christmas 2004, and put the "finishing touches" on it over the following summer. The band brought in rock producer [[Brown Bannister]], who had previously recorded albums for artists like [[Amy Grant]] and [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], to produce both ''The Christmas Sessions'' and their [[Coming Up to Breathe|next studio album]], which would also utilize a rock sound.<ref name="Well Mercy Me, Children!" /> In selecting songs for ''The Christmas Sessions'' the band wanted to cover Christmas songs they had grown up with, but they did write and record one original song, "[[Joseph's Lullaby]]". Millard had initially written it as "Mary's Lullaby" but changed the lyrics and key upon suggestion from Bannister's wife, who noted that, being male, it was odd for him to be singing from the perspective of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as opposed to [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].<ref name="Christmas With MercyMe">{{cite web|last=Huang|first=Sherry|title=Christmas With MercyMe|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Music/2005/12/Christmas-With-Mercyme.aspx#|publisher=[[Beliefnet]]|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}</ref>
