"'''JJ'''" is the seventh episode of the [[List of Skins episodes#Series 3|third series]] of the English [[teen drama]] ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', which first aired on 5 March 2009 on [[E4 (channel)|E4]] in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The episode was written by the series' co-creator, [[Bryan Elsley]], and was directed by Charles Martin. The episode focuses on the character of JJ Jones ([[Ollie Barbieri]]), who has [[Asperger syndrome]], and his confusion about his life and his desire to be normal. He strikes up a friendship with Emily Fitch ([[Kathryn Prescott]]) and attempts to solve the dispute between his friends James Cook ([[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]]) and Freddie Mclair ([[Luke Pasqualino]]) over their shared love interest, [[Effy Stonem]] ([[Kaya Scodelario]]).

"JJ" was filmed in November 2008. Barbieri undertook various measures to get into his character's mindset, including research, creating part of the set himself, and later destroying it. The episode featured numerous [[cameo appearance]]s by the series' crew members. "JJ" drew just under one million viewers on its first broadcast and was E4's highest-rated programme of the week. It was received generally well by critics, though the writers' decision for Emily to have sex with JJ drew criticism from the lesbian community.

==Plot==
JJ visits his psychiatrist, Dr Felly (Paul Ridley), seeking help for his recent bouts of rage and his confusion about his life and friends. Dr Felly has poor advice for JJ and prescribes him more drugs to calm him down. As he is leaving, he meets Emily, who came to the clinic to receive counselling in being more honest, but was simply prescribed the same drugs as JJ. She [[coming out|comes out]] to him and he shares with her his longing to be "normal" for a day so that he could lose his virginity and reunite Freddie and Cook. She advises him to just ask for the things he wants, so they visit Freddie to tell him to make up with Cook. At Freddie's house, though, they walk in on Freddie having sex with Emily's twin sister, Katie ([[Megan Prescott]]), and JJ accidentally reveals that Emily is gay. JJ asks Freddie to make up with Cook, but Freddie refuses and tells JJ to choose between him and Cook.

Returning home, JJ sees his mother, Cecilia ([[Juliet Cowan]]), overwhelmed by all of his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook to tell him how he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon ([[Lisa Backwell]]). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy illegal drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell ([[Lily Loveless]]) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone ([[Merveille Lukeba]]) lets them into the club, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.

Cook, under the influence of JJ's drugs, is compelled to tell the truth and confesses that Effy loves Freddie. Cook says that he loves Effy, but knows his feelings are not reciprocated and that is why he is having an affair with Pandora. Thomas, Pandora's boyfriend, overhears this and is furious. JJ leaves the club and finds a tearful Emily, who does not want to go home to face Katie. JJ invites her to spend the night with him and, after they agree to be friends, she offers to have sex with him as a "once-only charity event". JJ's mother meets Emily the next morning and watches them discuss the night before. She is overjoyed that he has made a real friend and believes that JJ will be alright after all.

Though Wigfield initially "couldn't believe" this, the studio was used for filming the scene, which Wigfield admitted "worked quite well".<ref name=lw/> The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in [[Bristol]]'s [[Brandon Hill, Bristol|Brandon Hill]] Park, near [[Cabot Tower (Bristol)|Cabot Tower]].<ref name=lw/>

"JJ" was received generally positive reviews from mainstream critics. One critic for [[PopSugar|PopSugar.com]] "love[d]" JJ's friendship with Emily and his mother's smile at the end of the episode, which they felt was "a touching moment to end with". They credited Cook's likableness, in spite of the character's flaws, to O'Connell's "great" acting.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.popsugar.co.uk/2894262| title = Series Three, Episode Seven "JJ"| accessdate = 2009-07-15| date = 6 March 2009| publisher = [[PopSugar]]}}</ref> Ellie Newton-Syms of ''InJournalism Magazine'' wrote that "digging into slightly deeper issues is what ''Skins'' is good at" and "there is clearly lots left to be revealed", as signified by Cook's drug-induced revelation that he has "nothing".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.injournalism.co.uk/2009/03/12/skins/| title = Skins| accessdate = 2009-07-15| date = 12 March 2009| work = InJournalism Magazine| author = Newton-Syms, Ellie}}</ref> [[Digital Spy]]'s Dan French reviewed the episode positively, finding JJ to be a "lovable" character. He considered Cook's confession that Effy truly loves Freddie and the revelation of Cook's affair with Pandora to be "shocking".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a148627/more-pill-popping-in-skins.html| title = More pill popping in 'Skins'| accessdate = 2009-07-15| date = 5 March 2009| publisher = [[Digital Spy]]| author = French, Dan}}</ref> Keeley Bolger, writing for ''[[The Sun]]'', sympathised with JJ, commenting that "JJ's drama doesn't end".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2289167/Skins-Freddie-puts-JJ-in-a-spin.html| title = Skins Freddie puts JJ in a spin| accessdate = 2009-07-15| date = 3 March 2009| work = [[The Sun]]| author = Bolger, Keeley}}</ref>

The episode drew criticism from the lesbian community, however. Kate Murray of lesbian-based website [[AfterEllen.com]] regarded Emily's willingness to have sex with JJ as the use of a "classic and highly offensive stereotype" and felt that this "undermine[d] what it means to be a lesbian". She thought that the episode fell short of the previous episode, "[[Naomi (Skins episode)|Naomi]]", which focused on Emily and Naomi's relationship, suggesting that this could be because "Naomi" was written by a 19-year-old female, Atiha Sen Gupta, while "JJ" was written by Elsley, a 47-year-old male.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2009/3/skins| title = "Skins" Controversial Lesbian Storyline| accessdate = 2009-07-15| date = 11 March 2009| publisher = [[AfterEllen.com]]| author = Murray, Kate}}</ref> The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, was critical of the episode, writing, "Welcome to the wonderful world of television, where being a lesbian and sleeping with men always goes hand in hand." She did believe, however, that Emily's coming out to JJ was "very funny" and Effy's nonchalance about Naomi's sexuality was "cool".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://eurout.org/2009/03/10/skins-recap-episode-307-%E2%80%9Cjj%E2%80%9D| title = Skins recap Episode 3.07: <U+201C>JJ<U+201D>| accessdate = 2009-07-15| date = 10 March 2009| publisher = eurOut.org}}</ref>
