The '''Focke-Wulf Ta 400''' was a large six-engined [[bomber]] design developed in [[Nazi Germany]] in 1943 by [[Focke-Wulf]] as a serious contender for the [[Amerika Bomber]] project. One of the first aircraft to be developed from components from multiple countries, it was also one of the most advanced [[Focke-Wulf]] designs of World War II, though it never progressed beyond a wind tunnel model.

Designed as a bomber and long-range [[reconnaissance]] plane by [[Kurt Tank]], the Ta 400 had a shoulder-mounted wing with 4<U+00B0> [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]]. One of the most striking features was the six [[BMW 801]]D [[radial engine]]s, to which two [[Jumo 004]] [[jet engine]]s were later added.

==Design and development==
In response to the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium|RLM]] guidelines of 22 January 1942, [[Kurt Tank]] of the Focke-Wulf company designed the Ta 400 as a bomber and long-range reconnaissance aircraft to be powered by six [[BMW 801]]D [[radial engine]]s, to which two [[Jumo 004]] [[jet engine]]s were later added. Design work was begun in 1943, much of it being carried out by French technicians working for Focke Wulf at [[Ch<U+00E2>tillon-sous-Bagneux]] near Paris, with contracts for design and construction of major components being awarded to German, French, and Italian companies in an attempt to speed the process and begin construction of prototypes as soon as possible.

The Ta 400 had a shoulder-mounted wing with 4<U+00B0> [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], with a long straight center section extending to the middle engine on each wing, and highly tapered outer wing panels. It had twin [[vertical stabilizer]]s mounted at the tips of the [[tailplane]]. Like the American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] the Ta 400 was to have a pressurized crew compartment and tail turret, connected by pressurized tunnel, as well as multiple [[remote control|remote-controlled]] [[Gun turret|turrets]]. The crew of nine was to be protected by a heavy defensive armament including ten 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon]]s. Fuel supply was to have distributed across 32 [[fuel tanks]]. Another design feature was [[tricycle landing gear]].

Maximum bomb load was to be {{convert|24|t|lb|abbr=on|r=3}}. With a [[gross weight]] of {{convert|80.27|t|lb}}, the Ta 400 with DB 603 engines was estimated to have a range of {{convert|12000|km|mi|abbr=on|r=-3}} in the reconnaissance role, cruising at {{convert|325|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The two bomber versions would have {{convert|76.07|t|ST}} and {{convert|80.87|t|ST}} gross weights with estimated ranges of {{convert|4500|km|mi|abbr=on|r=-3}} and {{convert|10600|km|mi|abbr=on|r=-3}} respectively. The projected [[Jumo]]-powered aircraft would have had a maximum range of {{convert|14000|km|mi|abbr=on|r=-3}} for long range reconnaissance and {{convert|13000|km|mi|abbr=on|r=-3}} as a bomber.<ref>Griehl 2006, pp. 60<U+2013>61.</ref>

As with the [[Heinkel He 277]] competitor for the ''Amerika Bomber'' contract, no prototype of the Ta 400 was ever built, it never progressed beyond a wind tunnel model, and performance, range and dimensions are based solely on the designers' estimates. The master aircraft designer Ernst Heinkel himself remarked in October 1943, while both designs were still being worked on, thought that only the Ta 400 could be a worthy competitor to his firm's He 277 for the Amerika Bomber competition.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 - 277 - 274 |url= |accessdate= |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |pages=197-199 }}</ref>

The Ta 400 was essentially a backup design for the [[Messerschmitt Me 264]]. As the design required more materials and labor than the Me 264, the RLM became convinced that further development of the Ta 400 was a waste and on 15 October 1943, notified Focke-Wulf that the program would be terminated,<ref>Griehl 2006, p. 138.</ref> but the minutes of a meeting in Italy of Tank with Italian aviation industrialists on 18 April 1944 confirmed that the design was still active{{Clarify|with the RLM or FW or Tank?|date=July 2011}} and proposed the cooperation of Italian industry in the project.<ref>Griehl 2006, p. 138.</ref>
