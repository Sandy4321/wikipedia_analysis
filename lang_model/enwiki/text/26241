'''Juan Rulfo''' ({{IPA-es|<U+02C8>xwan <U+02C8>rulfo|lang}} {{Audio|Juan Rulfo.ogg|audio}}; 16 May 1917<ref>Rulfo's date of birth is under dispute. His official web site ([http://www.clubcultura.com/clubliteratura/clubescritores/juanrulfo/cronologia2.htm/ Clubcultura.com]{{deadlink|date=June 2013}}) gives his year of birth as 1917; after 1937, however, it was often listed as 1918 because he had given the wrong date to get in the military academy that his uncle directed. [http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/rulped] [http://www.literatura.us/rulfo/]  [http://www.library.txstate.edu/SWWC/WG/EXHIBITS/sacabo.html]</ref> &ndash; 7 January 1986) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] writer, screenwriter and [[photographer]]. One of Latin America's most esteemed authors, Rulfo's reputation rests on two slim books, the novel ''[[Pedro P<U+00E1>ramo]]'' (1955), and ''[[El Llano en llamas]]'' (1953), a collection of [[short stories]]. Fifteen of these seventeen short stories have been translated into English and published as ''The Burning Plain and Other Stories''. This collection, includes his admired tale "<U+00A1>Diles que no me maten!" ("Tell Them Not to Kill Me!"). 

There are more than 6,000 negatives of his photographs at the Juan Rulfo Foundation.

==Early life==
Rulfo was born as '''Juan Nepomuceno Carlos P<U+00E9>rez Rulfo Vizca<U+00ED>no''' in Apulco, Jalisco (although he was registered at Sayula, Jalisco), in the home of his paternal grandfather. After his father was killed in 1923 and after his mother's death in 1927, his grandmother raised him in the town of [[San Gabriel, Jalisco]]. Their extended family consisted of landowners whose fortunes were ruined by the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the [[Cristero War]] of 1926-1928, a Roman Catholic [[integralism|integralist]] revolt against the government of Mexico following the [[Mexican Revolution]].

Rulfo's mother died from cardiac arrest in November 1927, when he was ten; his two uncles died a year later. Juan Rulfo had just been sent to study in the Luis Silva School, where he lived from 1928 to 1932. He completed six years of elementary school and a special seventh year from which he graduated as a bookkeeper, though he never practiced that profession. Rulfo attended a [[seminary]] (analogous to a [[secondary school]]) from 1932 to 1934, but did not attend a university afterwards <U+2500> both because the [[University of Guadalajara]] was closed due to a strike and because he had not taken preparatory school courses. Instead, Rulfo moved to [[Mexico City]], where he first entered the National Military Academy, which he left after three months and then he hoped to study law at the [[Universidad Nacional Aut<U+00F3>noma de M<U+00E9>xico]]. In 1936, Rulfo was able to audit courses in literature there because he obtained a job as an immigration file clerk through his uncle, David P<U+00E9>rez Rulfo, a colonel working for the government, who had also gotten him admitted to the military academy.

==Major works==
It was there that Rulfo first began writing under the tutelage of a coworker, [[Efr<U+00E9>n Hern<U+00E1>ndez]]. In 1944 Rulfo had cofounded the [[literary journal]] ''Pan''. Later he was able to advance in his position and he traveled Mexico as an immigration agent. In 1946 he started as a foreman for [[Goodrich Euzkadi]], but his mild temperament led him to prefer working as a wholesale traveling sales agent. This obligated him to travel throughout all of southern Mexico, until he was fired in 1952 for asking for a radio for his company car.

He married Clara Angelina Aparicio Reyes (Mexico City, August 12, 1928) in Guadalajara, Jalisco, on April 24, 1948; they had four children, Claudia Berenice (Mexico City, January 29, 1949), Juan Francisco (Guadalajara, Jalisco, December 13, 1950), Juan Pablo (M<U+00E9>xico City, April 18, 1955) and [[Juan Carlos Rulfo]] (M<U+00E9>xico City, January 24, 1964). Juan Rulfo obtained a fellowship at the Centro Mexicano de Escritores, supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. There, between 1952 and 1954, he was able to write the two books that would make him famous.

The first book was a collection of harshly realistic short stories titled ''[[El Llano en llamas]]'' (1953). The stories centered around life in rural Mexico around the time of the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the [[Cristero Rebellion]]. Among the best-known stories are "<U+00A1>Diles que no me maten!" ("Tell Them Not To Kill Me!"), about an old man, set to be executed, captured by orders of a colonel who happens to be the son of a man he killed about forty years ago; and "No oyes ladrar los perros" ("You Don't Hear the Dogs Barking"), about a man carrying his estranged, adult, wounded son on his back to find a doctor.

The second book was ''[[Pedro P<U+00E1>ramo]]'' (1955) a short novel about a man named Juan Preciado who travels to his recently deceased mother's hometown, Comala, to find his father, only to come across a literal [[ghost town]]<U+2500>populated, that is, by spectral figures. Initially, the novel met with cool critical reception and sold only two thousand copies during the first four years; later, however, the book became highly acclaimed. ''P<U+00E1>ramo'' was a key influence of Latin American writers such as [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]]. ''[[Pedro P<U+00E1>ramo]]'' has been translated into more than 30 different languages and the English version has been sold more than a million times in the United States.

The book went through several changes in name. In two letters written in 1947 to his fianc<U+00E9>e Clara Aparicio he refers to the title of this work he was writing then as ''Una estrella junto a la luna'' ("A Star Next to the Moon"), saying that it was causing him some trouble. During the last stages of writing, he wrote in journals that the title would be ''Los murmullos'' (''The Murmurs''). With the assistance of a grant from the Centro Mexicano de Escritores, Rulfo was able to finish the book between 1953 and 1954; it was published in 1955.

Between 1956 and 1958 Rulfo worked on a novella entitled ''El gallo de oro'' ("The Golden Cockerel"), which was not published until 1980. A revised and corrected edition was issued posthumously in 2010.<ref>https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_gallo_de_oro_%28novela%29</ref> The Fundaci<U+00F3>n Rulfo possesses fragments of two uncompleted novels, ''La cordillera'' and ''Ozumac<U+00ED>n.''<ref>http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=85353</ref> Rulfo told interviewer Luis Harss that he had written and destroyed an earlier novel set in Mexico City.<ref>Harss, Luis and Barbara Dohmann, ''Into the Mainstream: Conversations with Latin-American Writers.''</ref>

[[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]] has said that he felt blocked as a novelist after writing his first four books and that it was only his life-changing discovery of ''Pedro P<U+00E1>ramo'' in 1961 that opened his way to the composition of his masterpiece, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''. He noted that all of Rulfo's published writing, put together, "add up to no more than 300 pages; but that is almost as many and I believe they are as durable, as the pages that have come down to us from [[Sophocles]]".

A selection of Rulfo's photographs, accompanied by essays by [[Carlos Fuentes]] and others, has been published under the title of ''Juan Rulfo's Mexico.''

==Later life==
From 1954 to 1957, Juan Rulfo collaborated with "''La comisi<U+00F3>n del rio Papaloapan''", a government institution in charge of helping the socioeconomic development of the settlements along the [[Papaloapan River]] and from 1962 until his death in 1986, he worked as editor for the National Institute for Indigenous People.
