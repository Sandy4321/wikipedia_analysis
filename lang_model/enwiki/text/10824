'''Friedrich Ludwig Persius''' ([[15th February]] [[1803]]-[[12th July]] [[1845]]) was a [[Prussia]]n [[architect]] and a student of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].

Persius assisted Schinkel with, among others, the building of the [[Charlottenhof|Charlottenhof Castle]] and the [[Roman Baths (Potsdam)|Roman Baths]] in [[Sanssouci Park]] in Potsdam. He was also involved with the construction of the Great Fountain, the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Church of Peace]], and the [[Orangery]] and [[observation tower]] on the [[Ruinenberg]] opposite [[Sanssouci]] Palace.

==Life==

Ludwig Persius went to the public school and grammar school in Potsdam. From [[1817]] to [[1819]] he worked with the building inspector Gotthil Hecker; he enrolled as a carpenter. From 1819 he studied to become a surveyor at the Academy of Architecture in Berlin, and took his exam in March [[1821]]. From 1821 he worked as a building planner in Potsdam, working under, among others, [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] during the building of the castle and church on the grounds of Graf Potocki at [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]. In [[1824]] Persius became a member of the Association of Architects. In Glienicke he worked as a successful [[architect]] under Schinkel. In 1826 he passed his exam to become a master builder at the Academy of Architecture in Berlin, and became a building planner in Charlottenhof.

In 1827 he married Pauline Sello (1808-1883), with whom he had six children: Elisabeth (1929-80), Ludwig (1832-1902), Marie (1834-47), [[Reinhold Persius|Reinhold]] (1835-1912), Conrad (1836-1903) and Felix (1842-1885).

In 1829 Persius became a building inspector with the Royal Government in Potsdam. In [[1833]] he completed his first independent work, renovating the artificial mills (near the Roman Baths) into a residential house for Handmann, the gardener. In 1834 he became the Royal Court Building Inspector.

In [[1840]] he made a journey on the Rhine, that brought him to, among others, [[Heidelberg]] and [[Bacharach]], as well as the [[Stolzenfels Castle]] and [[Festung Ehrenbreitstein|Ehrenbreitstein Fortress]]. In 1841 he travelled to Paris, and went on to visit [[Munich]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Andernach]], [[Remagen|Remagen-Rolandseck]], [[Bad Godesberg]] and [[Cologne]]. In 1842 he went on a further journey: to [[Lehnin]], [[Chorin]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and thence to [[Erfurt]].

In [[1841]] [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] named Persius as his court architect. In 1842 he became a Royal Architectural Advisor and member of the Chief Architectural Authority. In 1843/44 Persius worked for Prince [[Hermann von P<U+00FC>ckler-Muskau]] among others.

In 1843 he made a further journey on the Rhine, which included [[Bingen]], [[Bad Godesberg]] and [[Trier]]. In 1844 he travelled to [[Bad Muskau]] and [[Holland]]. In 1845 he undertook a journey to [[Italy]] via [[N<U+00EE>mes]], [[Marseille]] and [[Genua]] to [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Vicenza]], [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Verona]].

In 1845 Persius was appointed as Head Architectural Advisor with retrospective effect from 12th October 1842. On 12th July 1845 he died and was laid to rest in the Bornstedt Cemetery in Sello-Teil (near the [[Krongut Bornstedt]]).
