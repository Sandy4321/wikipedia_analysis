'''Nancy Campbell Cartwright''' (born October 25, 1957) is an American film and television actress, comedian and [[Voice acting|voice artist]]. She is best known for her long-running role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Cartwright voices other characters for the show, including [[Nelson Muntz]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Flanders family#Todd|Todd Flanders]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]] and [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Database|Database]].

Born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained alongside voice actor [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed with a starring role in the television movie ''Marian Rose White'' (1982) and her first feature film, ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983).

After continuing to search for acting work, in 1987 Cartwright auditioned for a role in [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]] that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart<U+2014>Lisa's brother<U+2014>to be more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called ''[[The Simpsons]]''. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.

Cartwright has voiced dozens of animated characters, including [[Chuckie Finster]] in ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', [[List of characters in Kim Possible#Rufus|Rufus]] in ''[[Kim Possible]]'', [[Buttons and Mindy|Mindy]] in ''[[Animaniacs]]'', Margo Sherman in ''[[The Critic]]'' and Chip in ''The Kellys''. In 2000, she published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', and four years later adapted it into a [[One person show|one-woman play]].

==Early life==
Nancy Cartwright was born in Dayton, Ohio,<ref name="Little"/> on October 25, 1957, the fourth of Frank and Miriam Cartwright's six children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nancycartwright.com/html/about/bio.html|title=Biography highlights|publisher=Nancycartwright.com|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> She grew up in [[Kettering, Ohio]],<ref name=Cincinatti/> and discovered her talent for voices at an early age. While in the [[fourth grade]], she won a school-wide speech competition with her performance of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories|How the Camel Got His Hump]]''.<ref name="Eat my shorts">{{cite news|title=Nancy Cartwright: Eat my shorts|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/nancy-cartwright-eat-my-shorts-491916.html|date=2005-05-24|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2009-02-06 | location=London}}</ref> Cartwright attended [[Fairmont High School (Ohio)|Fairmont West High School]], and participated in the school's theater and marching band. She regularly entered public speaking competitions, placing first in the "Humorous Interpretation" category at the National District Tournament two years running. The judges often suggested to her that she should perform cartoon voices. Cartwright graduated from high school in 1976 and accepted a scholarship from [[Ohio University]].<ref>Cartwright, pp. 9<U+2013>10.</ref> She continued to compete in public speaking competitions; during her sophomore year, she placed fifth in the National Speech Tournament's exposition category with her speech "The Art of Animation".<ref>Cartwright, pp. 15<U+2013>16.</ref>

In 1977, Cartwright landed a part-time job doing voice-overs for commercials on [[WING]] radio in Dayton.<ref name=Cincinatti>{{Cite web|title=Bart Simpson's secrets revealed |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/12/18/tem_kiesewetter_bart.html|author=Kieswetter, John|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=2000, 12-18|accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref> A representative from [[Warner Bros.

Cartwright called him, and left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine.<ref name="Eat my shorts"/> Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to send him a tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes. For the next year they continued in this way, completing a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as "absolutely amazing, always encouraging, always polite".<ref>Cartwright, p. 14.</ref>

Cartwright returned to [[Ohio University]] for her sophomore year, but transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) so she could be closer to Hollywood and Butler.<ref name=Cincinatti/> Her mother, Miriam, died late in the summer of 1978.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Just don't call me Bart|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|date=2000-11-19}}</ref> Cartwright nearly changed her relocation plans but, on September 17, 1978, "joylessly" left for [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], [[Los Angeles]].<ref>Cartwright, pp. 16<U+2013>18.</ref>

While attending UCLA, which did not have a public speaking team,<ref>Cartwright, p. 19.</ref> Cartwright continued training as a voice actor with Butler.

At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a [[situation comedy|sitcom]] called ''In Trouble''.

In 1985, she auditioned for a guest spot as Cynthia in ''[[Cheers]]''. The audition called for her to say her line and walk off the set.

He recommended that Cartwright study ''[[La strada]]'', a 1956 Italian film starring [[Giulietta Masina]] and directed by [[Federico Fellini]]. She began performing "every imaginable scene" from ''La strada'' in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation.<ref name="p30"/> She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person.

Cartwright is best known for her role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the long-running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', a sketch comedy program. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the older daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever".<ref>Cartwright, pp. 35<U+2013>40</ref> Creator [[Matt Groening]] let her try out for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm|title=Bart's voice tells all|accessdate=2009-02-05|date=2000-11-10|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it in ''My Little Pony'', ''Snorks'', and ''Pound Puppies''.<ref name="My Boy"/> Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared with other characters.<ref name="My Boy"/> The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of the ''The Tracey Ullman Show''.

In 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] called ''The Simpsons''.

Cartwright felt it appropriate for Bart, and improvised the line; it became a popular catchphrase on the show.<ref name=Trivia>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=2007-07-29|date=2007-07-26|author=Carroll, Larry|publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>
