"'''Army of Ghosts'''" is the twelfth and penultimate episode in the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Series 2 (2006)|second series]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' which was first broadcast on [[1 July]] [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756449/ IMDB profile for Army of Ghosts]</ref> It is the first episode of a two-part story; the concluding episode, "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]", was first broadcast on [[8 July]].

The episode takes part on contemporary Earth, some time after the Doctor<U+2019>s and Rose<U+2019>s visit to Earth in "[[Love & Monsters]]". During this time, the public have become accustomed to intermittent appearances of [[ghost]]s. The Doctor tracks the source of the ghosts to the Torchwood Institute, where the Doctor learns of the Cybermen from "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" and "[[The Age of Steel]]" crossing a breach in the "[[List of Doctor Who planets#Void|Void]]" created by a [[Dalek]]-piloted "[[List of Doctor Who vehicles#Void Ship|void ship]]".

==Plot==
The episode begins with [[Rose Tyler]] narrating how her life changed when she met the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], and that she thought it would last forever. But then came the ghosts, [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]], and the war, and begins to tell how her travels ended.

The [[TARDIS]] materialises on the Powell Estate so Rose can visit her mother, [[Jackie Tyler]]. Jackie shows the Doctor and Rose, to their surprise, that ghosts have been regularly visiting since they last left. After watching various television programmes, the Doctor and Rose find out that the ghosts started visiting several months before, and over time humanity accepted them. Disturbed by both the ghosts and their appearances being scheduled, the Doctor traces the "ghost shift" to [[One Canada Square]], the secret base of the Torchwood Institute. 

Torchwood are shown to be, along with causing the ghosts to appear, experimenting on a sphere, which arrived concurrently with the ghosts. The sphere is commented to be without mass or a gravitation field &ndash; physically, it does not exist. The cause of all these is shown to be a "breach" between universes caused by the sphere, allowing Cybermen from a parallel universe<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[The Age of Steel]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Tom MacRae]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Rise of the Cybermen]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Tom MacRae]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-05-13}}</ref> to filter through, and slowly infiltrate Torchwood's ranks.

Upon arriving at Torchwood, the Doctor is taken prisoner, along with Jackie, who [[Yvonne Hartman]], director of Torchwood, believes to be Rose. The Doctor is told that his encounter with [[Victoria of England|Queen Victoria]] made him an [[enemy of the state]], and was the catalyst for the creation of Torchwood.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T. Davies]], Director [[Euros Lyn]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-04-22}}</ref> He is then shown the sphere, which he identifies as a "[[void ship]]", and the experiments on the breach, which the Doctor strongly disapproving of both practices, noting that experimenting with the breach will only cause it to fracture more.

Rose, free from detection, masquerades as an employee, and explores Torchwood. She is able to get into the chamber where the void ship is located, but is immediately questioned by Dr Singh, who is in charge of experimenting upon the sphere. He discovers that Rose is an imposter, and asks his colleague Samuel, who Rose recognises as [[Mickey Smith]], to seal the doors.

At the end of the episode, the breach is fully opened, and the multitude of Cybermen are able to cross the Void. The Doctor notes that the Cybermen had already invaded the Earth successfully. At the same time, the void ship begins to open, and Mickey prepares to kill whatever comes out. The final scenes happen concurrently, and are of the Doctor learning in horror that the void ship is not of Cybermen design, and Rose, Mickey, and Singh watching four [[Dalek]]s unexpectedly emerging from the void ship, with their leader, a [[Dalek Supreme]], giving the order to exterminate.

==Continuity==
The majority of this episode takes place in the Torchwood Institute, which is seen on screen for the first time. The phrase "Torchwood" first originated from an anagram of ''Doctor Who'' used to conceal the "[[dailies|rushes]]" tapes during the filming of the first series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4349120.stm|title = Doctor Who spin-off made in Wales|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[17 October]] [[2005]]}}</ref> It was an "[[Story arcs in Doctor Who|arc word]]" used through the majority of the second series,<ref>{{cite episode | title = Welcome to Torchwood | series = [[Doctor Who Confidential]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Three]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-07-01}}</ref> starting with the episode "[[Bad Wolf]]".<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Bad Wolf]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T.

The episode's secondary plot device is the Cybermen, from the universe featured in "The Age of Steel" and "Rise of the Cybermen".<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Rise of the Cybermen]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Tom MacRae]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[The Age of Steel]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Tom MacRae]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2006-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T.

==Production==
The two-part finale comprising "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday" was originally going to take place in Cardiff on the [[Cardiff Rift|time rift]] which was the focus of the episodes "[[The Unquiet Dead]]" and "[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]". With the commission of the ''Torchwood'' series in 2005, Davies decided to base the spin-off in Cardiff and relocate "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday" to [[Canary Wharf]] in London.<ref name="brief">{{Brief| id=2006lm | title=Army Of Ghosts" / "Doomsday|quotes=y}}</ref>

To ensure that [[Noel Clarke]] and [[Shaun Dingwall]] ([[Mickey Smith]] and [[Pete Tyler]], respectively) were available for filming, the story was filmed in the season's third production block along with "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" and "[[The Age of Steel]]". Filming for the story started on [[2 November]] [[2005]] on location in Kennington, but this story did not become the primary focus of the production crew until [[29 November]], when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber. Scenes in the lever room, the main setting for the story, were filmed between [[12 December]] and [[15 December]], and [[3 January]] and [[5 January]] [[2006]].<ref name="brief" />

The episode is also the first episode in which [[Freema Agyeman]] appears. Originally only considered for the role of Adeola in this episode, Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's acting, especially alongside Tennant, and called her back to fill the role of [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] that Piper had chosen to leave. Agyeman was officially announced to be playing [[Martha Jones]] on [[4 July]] [[2006]],<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/05/agyeman2.shtml BCC press release "Freema Agyeman is New Companion Martha Jones"]</ref> with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' commenting that she was (instead of [[Mickey Smith]]) the Doctor's "first black assistant".<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=394073&in_page_id=1773 Daily Mail 5/7/2006 - Exit Billie as Doctor Who get's first black side-kick]</ref> Agyeman first appeared as Martha in the episode "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]", which explained the resemblance between the two characters that she had portrayed.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T.

The episode also features references to other programmes by the BBC. The most notable of these is the cameo of [[Barbara Windsor]] as [[Peggy Mitchell]] in ''[[EastEnders]]'', where she [[wikt:bar#Verb|bar]]s a ghost who she presumes to be [[Den Watts]] from [[The Queen Victoria]]. Watts, presumed killed in 1989, returned to the soap in 2003,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3151484.stm|title=Sixteen million watch Den's return|publisher=BBC|date=[[2003-09-30]]|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> before being killed a second time in 2005 after being written out of the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3988347.stm|title=Dirty Den actor leaves EastEnders|publisher=BBC|date=[[2004-11-06]]|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> Additionally, the shot of One Canada Square is taken from the opening credits of ''[[The Apprentice (UK)|The Apprentice]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/confidential/index12.shtml|title=Episode 12: Welcome to Torchwood|work=[[Doctor Who Confidential]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2006-07-02|format=Embedded [[.swf|Flash object]]}}</ref>

==Broadcast and reception==
To keep the appearance of the Daleks secret, the final scene was removed from all preview tapes and replaced with a title card reading "final scene withheld until transmission", including the copy given to the ''Doctor Who'' microsite's "fear forecast" team.<ref name="fear_forecast">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2006/fear/f-armyofghosts.shtml|title=Fear Forecast: Army of Ghosts|publisher=BBC|work=Doctor Who microsite|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref>

The episode was generally well reviewed by critics. ''[[The Stage]]'' commented that the episode was "a tense contest, full of drama, tears, adversity and two powerful forces coming face to face in the ultimate battle" while mockingly downplaying the [[England national football team|England football team]]'s defeat earlier that evening. The author of the review then stated that the cliffhanger increased his affection of the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/07/who_bounces_back.php|title=Who bounces back|date=2006-07-02|accessdate=2008-01-17|first=Mark|last=Wright|publisher=''[[The Stage]]''}}</ref>.
