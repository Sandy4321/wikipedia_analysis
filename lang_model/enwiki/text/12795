'''Errico Malatesta''' (December 14, 1853 <U+2013> July 22, 1932) was an Italian [[Anarchist communism|anarchist]]. He spent much of his life exiled from Italy and in total spent more than ten years in prison. Malatesta wrote and edited a number of radical newspapers and was also a friend of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. He was an enormously popular figure in his time. According to [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]], writer for [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'' magazine]], "Malatesta could get tens of thousands, sometimes more than 100,000, fans to show up whenever [he] arrived in town."<ref>[[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Doherty, Brian]] (December 17, 2010) [http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/17/the-first-war-on-terror/singlepage The First War on Terror], ''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''</ref>

== Biography ==
===Early years===

Errico Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in [[Santa Maria Capua Vetere]], Italy (in the [[province of Caserta]]) on December 14, 1853. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an "insolent and threatening" letter to King [[Victor Emmanuel II]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Gu<U+00E9>rin, Daniel|title=No Gods, No Masters, Volumes 1<U+2013>4|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859253|page=349|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g4YncZ8MgRsC&pg=PA349}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Benewick, Robert|chapter=Errico Malatesta 1853<U+2013>1932|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415096232|page=202|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-jnaCUyzjMQC&pg=PA202}}</ref>

Malatesta was introduced to [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] [[Republicanism]] while studying medicine at the [[University of Naples]]; however, he was expelled from the university in 1871 for joining a demonstration. Partly via his enthusiasm for the [[Paris Commune]] and partly via his friendship with [[Carmelo Palladino]], he joined the [[Naples]] section of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] that same year, as well as teaching himself to be a mechanic and electrician. In 1872 he met [[Mikhail Bakunin]], with whom he participated in the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St Imier congress]] of the International. For the next four years, Malatesta helped spread Internationalist propaganda in Italy; he was imprisoned twice for these activities.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In April 1877, Malatesta, [[Carlo Cafiero]], the Russian [[Stepniak]] and about thirty others started an [[insurrection]] in the [[Benevento (province)|province of Benevento]], taking the villages of [[Letino]] and [[Gallo Matese|Gallo]] without a struggle. The revolutionaries burned tax registers and declared the end of the King's reign and were met by enthusiasm. After leaving Gallo, however, they were arrested by government troops and held for sixteen months before being acquitted. After [[Giovanni Passannante]]'s murder attempt on the king [[Umberto I]], the radicals were kept under constant surveillance by the police. Even though the anarchists claimed to have no connection to Passannante, Malatesta, being an advocate of social revolution, was included in this surveillance. After returning to [[Naples]], he was forced to leave Italy altogether in the fall of 1878 because of these conditions, beginning his life in exile.<ref name=Joll174>James Joll, ''The Anarchists.'' Boston, MA: Little, Brown & Co., 1964; pg. 74.</ref>

===Years of exile===

He went to Egypt briefly, visiting some Italian friends but was soon expelled by the Italian Consul.<ref name=Joll174 /> After working his passage on a French ship and being refused entry to Syria, Turkey and Italy, he landed in Marseille where he made his way to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] <U+2013> then something of an anarchist centre.<ref name=Joll174 /> It was there that he befriended [[<U+00C9>lis<U+00E9>e Reclus]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]], helping the latter to produce ''[[La R<U+00E9>volte]].'' The Swiss respite was bief, however, and after a few months he was expelled from Switzerland, traveling first to [[Romania]] before reaching Paris, where he worked briefly as a mechanic.<ref name=Joll175>Joll, ''The Anarchists,'' pg. 175.</ref>

In 1881 he set out for a new home in London. He would come and go from that city for the next 40 years.<ref name=Joll175 /> 

There Malatesta worked as an ice cream seller and a mechanic, and participated in the 1872 congress of the International, which gave birth to the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
Malatesta's mistress in the 1870s, Emilia Tronzio, was the step-sister of the internationalist [[Tito Zanardelli]].<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/2586/1/Italian_Anarchists_in_London_1870-1914.pdf|title=Italian Anarchists in London |page=54
 |last=Dipaola|first=Pietro|date=April 2004 |accessdate=August 28, 2013|chapter=The 1880s and the International Revolutionary Socialist Congress}}</ref>
With Malatesta's consent and support she married [[Giovanni Defendi]], who came to stay with Malatesta in London in 1881 after being released from jail.<ref>{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Sur les traces de Malatesta 2010}} |url=http://acontretemps.org/spip.php?article282 |title=Sur les traces de Malatesta|date=January 2010|journal=A Contretemps|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref>

Malatesta attended the Anarchist Congress that met in London from July 14, 1881.
Other delegates included [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Francesco Saverio Merlino]], [[Marie Le Compte]], [[Louise Michel]] and [[<U+00C9>mile Gautier]]. 
While respecting "complete autonomy of local groups" the congress defined propaganda actions that all could follow 
and agreed that "propaganda by the deed" was the path to social revolution.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_2006_num_84_4_5056|page=965 |last=Bantman|first=Constance|title=Internationalism without an International?

With the outbreak of the [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian War]] in 1882, Malatesta organized a small group to help fight against the British. In August, he and three other men departed for Egypt. They landed in [[Abu Qir]], then travelled towards Ramleh, [[Alexandria]]. After a difficult crossing of [[Lake Mariout]], they were surrounded and detained by British forces, without having undertaken any fighting. He secretly returned to Italy the following year.<ref>[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/malatesta/lifeofmalatesta.html Life of Malatesta], by [[Luigi Fabbri]] (1936) at Anarchy Archives</ref>

In [[Florence]] he founded the weekly anarchist paper ''[[La Questione Sociale]]'' (''The Social Question'') in which his most popular [[pamphlet]], ''[[Fra Contadini]]'' (''Among Farmers''), first appeared. Malatesta went back to Naples in 1884 <U+2014> while waiting to serve a three-year prison term <U+2014> to nurse the victims of a [[cholera]] epidemic. Once again, he fled Italy to escape imprisonment, this time heading for [[South America]]. He lived in [[Buenos Aires]] from 1885 until 1889, resuming publication of ''La Questione Sociale'' and spreading anarchist ideas among the Italian <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> community there.<ref name=Joll175 /> He was involved in the founding of the first militant workers' union in [[Argentina]], the bakers union, and left an anarchist impression in the workers' movements there for years to come.<ref name=Joll175 />

Returning to Europe in 1889, Malatesta first published a newspaper called ''[[L'Associazione]]'' in [[Nice]], [[France]], remaining there until until he was once again forced to flee to London.

===Arrest in Italy===

The late 1890s were a time of social turmoil in Italy, marked by bad harvests, rising prices, and [[peasant]] revolts.<ref name=Joll175 /> [[Strike action|Strikes]] of workers were met by demands for repression and for a time it seemed as though government authority was hanging by a thread.<ref name=Joll175 /> Malatesta found the situation irresistible and early in 1898 he returned to the port city of [[Ancona]] to take part in the blossoming anarchist movement among the dockworkers there.<ref name=Joll175 /> Malatesta was soon identified as a leader during street fighting with police and arrested; he was therefore unable to participate further in the dramatic industrial and political actions of 1898 and 1899.<ref name=Joll175 />

From jail Malatesta took a hard line against participation in elections on behalf of liberal and [[socialism|socialist]] politicians, contradicting [[Saverio Merlino]] and other anarchist leaders who argued in favor of electoral participation as an emergency measure during times of social turmoil.<ref name=Joll175 /> Malatesta was convicted of "seditious association"and sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the island of [[Lampedusa]].<ref>Joll, ''The Anarchists,'' pp. 175-176.</ref> He was able to escape from prison in May 1899, however, and he was able to make his way home to London via [[Malta]] and [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=Joll176>joll, ''The Anarchists,'' pg. 176.</ref>

In subsequent years Malatesta visited the [[United States of America]], speaking there to anarchists in the Italian and Spanish immigrant communities.<ref name=Joll176 /> Home again in London, he was closely watched by the police, who increasingly regarded anarchists as a threat following the July 1900 assassination of [[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]] by an Italian anarchist who had been living in [[Paterson, New Jersey]].<ref name=Joll176 />

===Return to London===
{{Anarchism sidebar |People}}

By 1910 he had opened an electrical workshop in London at 15 Duncan Terrace Islington and allowed the jewel thief George Gardenstein to use his premises. On January 15, 1910 he sold oxyacetylene cutting equipment for <U+00A3>5 (<U+00A3>500 at 2013 monetary values) to George Gardenstein so that he could break into the safe at H.S.Harris jewellers Houndsditch. Gardenstein led the gang that mounted the abortive Houndsditch robbery that is the precursor to the [[Siege of Sidney Street]]. Malatesta's cutting gear is on permanent display at the City of London Police museum at Wood St police station<ref>City of London Police museum</ref>

While based London, Malatesta made clandestine trips to France, Switzerland and Italy and went on a lecture tour of Spain with [[Fernando Tarrida del M<U+00E1>rmol]]. During this time he wrote several important pamphlets, including ''[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/malatesta-anarchy-1891/ L'Anarchia]''. Malatesta then took part in the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] (1907), where he debated in particular with [[Pierre Monatte]] on the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade-union]]ism). The latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta considered that syndicalism by itself was not sufficient.<ref name=Amsterdam>[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}</ref> (see on Labor Unions, below). In 1912, Malatesta appeared in [[Bow Street Police Court]] on a criminal libel charge, which resulted in a 3&nbsp;month prison [[Sentence (law)|sentence]], and his recommendation for [[deportation]]. This order was quashed following campaigning by the radical press and demonstrations by workers organisations.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

After the [[First World War]], Malatesta eventually returned to Italy for the final time. Two years after his return, in 1921, the Italian government imprisoned him, again, although he was released two months before the fascists came to power. From 1924 until 1926, when [[Benito Mussolini]] silenced all independent press, Malatesta published the journal ''[[Pensiero e Volont<U+00E0>]]'', although he was harassed and the journal suffered from government censorship. He was to spend his remaining years leading a relatively quiet life, earning a living as an electrician. After years of suffering from a weak respiratory system and regular [[Bronchospasm|bronchial attacks]], he developed bronchial [[pneumonia]] from which he died after a few weeks, despite being given 1500 litres of oxygen in his last five hours. He died on Friday, July 22, 1932. He was an atheist.<ref>Misato Toda, ''Errico Malatesta da Mazzini a Bakunin'', Guida Editori, 1988, pg. 75.</ref>

== Political beliefs ==

Malatesta is difficult to place within the spectrum of the various political camps within anarchism both because his politics changed over time and because he did not identify himself strongly with any of the various groupings.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

His constant work as an organizer and speaker embodied his ideals of free association: for Malatesta, it was useful to join an organization only for the purpose of ''doing'' something with that group of people.  There was no sense in belonging to a group simply to belong.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===On labor unions===

He argued with [[Pierre Monatte]] at the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam|Amsterdam Conference of 1907]] against pure [[syndicalism]].  Malatesta thought that trade-unions were [[reformist]], and could even be, at times, conservative. Along with [[Christiaan Cornelissen]], he cited as example [[Labor unions in the United States|US trade-unions]], where trade-unions composed of skilled qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to un-skilled workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.<ref name=Amsterdam/> Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have overthrowing capitalism and the state, and the anarchist ideal of communist society as their end, and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.<ref>{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A. K. Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-902593-19-7 |page=89 }}</ref>

His arguments against the doctrine of revolutionary unions known as [[anarcho-syndicalism]] were later developed in a series of articles, where he wrote "I am against syndicalism, both as a doctrine and a practice, because it strikes me as a hybrid creature."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1926/03/syndic3.htm <U+201C>Further Thoughts on Anarchism and the Labour Movement<U+201D>] (March 1926)</ref> Despite their drawbacks, he advocated activity in the trade unions, both because they were necessary for the organization and self-defense of workers under a capitalist state regime, and as a way of reaching broader masses. Anarchists should have discussion groups in unions, as in factories, barracks and schools, but "anarchists should not want the unions to be anarchist."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1925/04/syndic1.htm <U+201C>Syndicalism and Anarchism<U+201D>] (April/May 1925)</ref>

He thought that, like all unions, "Syndicalism...is by nature reformist."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1925/12/syndic2.htm <U+201C>The Labor Movement and Anarchism<U+201D>] December 1925.</ref> While anarchists should be active in the rank and file, he said "any anarchist who has agreed to become a permanent and salaried official of a trade union is lost to anarchism."<ref>Quoted in [http://www.scribd.com/doc/8344384/Guerin-Anarchism-From-Theory-to-Practice-1970 Anarchism: From theory to practice] Daniel Guerin, Monthly Review Press, 1970</ref>

While some anarchists wanted to split from conservative unions to form revolutionary syndicalist unions, Malatesta predicted they would either remain an "affinity group" with no influence, or go through the same process of bureaucratization as the unions they left.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1925/12/syndic2.htm <U+201C>The Labor Movement and Anarchism<U+201D>] El Productor, December 1925</ref> This early statement of what would come to be known as "the rank-and-file strategy" remained a minority position within anarchism, but Malatesta's ideas did have echoes in the anarchists Jean Grave and Vittorio Aurelio.

===On violence===
{{Further|Anarchism and violence}}

Malatesta was a committed revolutionary: he believed that the anarchist revolution was coming soon, and that violence would be a necessary part of it since the [[State (polity)|state]] rested ultimately on violent coercion. As he wrote in his article "The Revolutionary 'Haste'":

:''It is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective; but to achieve this end, it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for development, and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies these means to the workers.'' (''[[Umanit<U+00E0> Nova]]'', number 125, September 6, 1921<ref>[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html The revolutionary haste by Errico Malatesta<!-- bot-generated title -->] at flag.blackened.net</ref>)

Malatesta, then, advocated violence as a "necessary" part of the emancipation of the working class.
