'''Transport in Buckinghamshire''' has been shaped its position nationally; most routes between the [[United Kingdom]]'s two largest cities, [[London]] and [[Birmingham]] pass through the county. The county's growing industry (such as in [[Slough]]) also brought new railways and canals to the area, later followed by motorways.

Much of [[Buckinghamshire]]'s transport network can be traced to two ancient roads, the Roman [[Akeman Street]] and the Celtic [[Watling Street]]. These paths are now roughly followed by the [[A41 road|A41]] and [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]. In 1838, Bucks became one of the first counties in England to gain railways, with sections of both the [[West Coast Main Line]]<ref name=A>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/media/adobepdf/2%20LondonBirmingham%20D.pdf|title=London and Birmingham railway|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> and [[Great Western Main Line]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/m_in_gwr.htm|title=Great Western history, 1835-1892|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> opening. These were later followed by other main lines and numerous rural branch lines,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucksrailways.co.uk/BR-Frame.htm|title=Buckinghamshire rail routes|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> many of which closed in the 1930s. The [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s also closed the [[Great Central Main Line]] north of [[Aylesbury]] in 1966. The county was also one of the few counties to gain a motorway in the 1950s when the [[M1 motorway]] opened its entire section through Buckinghamshire in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m1/|title=Motorway Database (M1)|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> Air travel is the only major mode of transport not to have a presence in Buckinghamshire- although [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] in Greater London is less than a mile from the southern border of the two counties.

===Origins===
[[File:Denbigh Hall Bridge on the London and Birmingham railway.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Denbigh Hall Bridge, in Buckinghamshire, was the terminus for several months before the line was completed north to Rugby]]

The railway boom of northern England led to the formation of the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (L&BR) by Robert Stephenson in 1833, with the intention of meeting Joseph Locke's [[Grand Junction Railway]] at Birmingham, creating a north-south route.<ref>*{{cite book|editor1-first=Max |editor1-last=Wade-Matthews |title=The World's Great Railway Journeys|year=1999|publisher=Sebastian Kelly|location=Oxford|isbn=1-84081-126-9|page=70}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railbrit.co.uk/London_and_Birmingham_Railway/frame.htm|title=London and Birmingham Railway|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> Though the rail line was initially planned to go through [[Buckingham]], where carriage works would have been built, it was altered to [[Wolverton]] due to objection from the [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]]. A line to Buckingham would later open in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Simpson, Bill|title=Banbury to Verney Junction Branch|year=1994|publisher=Lamplight Publications|location=Banbury, Oxfordshire|isbn=978-1-899246-00-7|pages=p. 105}}</ref> Construction of the L&BR began in November 1833 and the section from [[London Euston]] to [[Boxmoor]] in Hertfordshire opened in 1837. The line to [[Bletchley]] was completed by the summer of 1838; from there passengers took a stagecoach shuttle to [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] where the railway continued north.<ref name="A"/> The line through what is now Milton Keynes opened several months later on 17 September 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RAbirmingham.htm|title=London and Birmingham|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref><ref name=B>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/mkm/wolvwork1.html|title=A Short History of Wolverton Works|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> [[Wolverton]] later became famous as the site of [[Wolverton railway works]] which produced rolling stock for over a century&mdash;the last new carriage was built there in 1962. The site now houses a supermarket.<ref name="B"/>

At the same time, another railway company, the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) was formed in 1833, with the intention of linking London and the growing port of [[Bristol]]. [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was appointed as engineer the same year. Construction began in the mid 1830s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/m_in_gwr.htm|title=Great Western history, 1835 - 1892|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> The line from [[London Paddington|Paddington]] through Buckinghamshire was opened on 4 June 1838 terminating at Maidenhead Bridge station until [[Maidenhead Railway Bridge]] was ready.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thames.me.uk/s00710.htm|title=Maidenhead Railway Bridge|accessdaymonth=31 January |accessyear=2008}}</ref> The line west into Berkshire opened 1 July 1839.<ref>{{cite book |title = History of the Great Western Railway, volume I 1833-1863|last= MacDermot |first= E T |year= 1927 |location= London }}{{Page number}}</ref><ref name=C>{{cite web|url=http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r010.html|title=The Story of the G.W.R.|accessdaymonth=1 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref>{{Page number}} The line became notable for its use of [[broad gauge]] (which was favoured by Brunel) as opposed to [[standard gauge]], which was preferred by most other railway engineers including [[George Stephenson|George]] and [[Robert Stephenson]]. Other railways using standard gauge later met the GWR resulting in the [[Great Western Railway#The "gauge war"|gauge war]] which the GWR eventually lost. The section through Bucks had a third rail laid on 1 October 1861 allowing both standard and broad gauge trains to run. The broad gauge was removed throughout the country in 1892. The line through Buckinghamshire was [[Double track#Quadruple track|quadrupled]] in late 1800s.<ref name="C"/>

[[File:Varsity Line.svg|thumb|right|240px|The path of the Buckinghamshire Railway, known as the [[Varsity Line]], today eventually linked Oxford and Cambridge, the section between Bedford and Cambridge opened in 1862.<ref>{{cite book|title=Railways to Cambridge, actual and proposed|last=Fellows|first=Reginald B,|publisher=Oleander Press|year=1976|isbn=0-902675-62-1}}</ref>]]

In 1839, a branch line opened from [[Cheddington railway station|Cheddington]] on the L&BR to [[Aylesbury]], the county town of Buckinghamshire as a way of transporting goods, in particular the [[Aylesbury Duck]] to London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domestic-waterfowl.co.uk/ayls.htm|title=Aylesbury Ducks|accessdaymonth=4 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> This however required a change at Cheddington, as the line was built connecting north towards Bletchley.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|title=Cheddington|url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=cheddington+railway+station&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=12.061542,39.550781&ie=UTF8&ll=51.854442,-0.662184&spn=0.012299,0.038624&t=h&z=15|year=2008|accessmonth=January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> The [[Aylesbury Railway]], or [[Cheddington to Aylesbury Line]] was independent but operated by the L&BR up to 1846, when the L&BR and two other railway companies merged to form the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR). From then onwards, the line was owned by the LNWR.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Simpson, Bill|title=The Aylesbury Railway, the First Branch Line, Cheddington ~ Aylesbury|year=1989|publisher=Oxford Publishing Co.|isbn=978-0860934387|pages=120}}</ref>

The next line to open was the ''Oxford and Bletchley Railway'' on 17 November 1846; it ran between [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]] and Bletchley.<ref>''The World's Greatest Railway Journeys'', p. 84.</ref><ref name="Awdry_p63">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British Railway Companies|last=Awdry|first=Christopher|location=Sparkford|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd|year=1990|page=63|isbn=1-8526-0049-7}}</ref> That company merged with the ''Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway'' in 1847 to form the [[Buckinghamshire Railway]], which was extended a year later in 1850 to [[Banbury Merton Street railway station|Banbury]]. A junction was formed in 1851 at [[Verney Junction|Verney]] for the line from there to [[Oxford Rewley Road railway station|Oxford]].<ref name="Awdry_p63"/> The Buckinghamshire Railway was worked by the LNWR from July 1851 on, and it was later absorbed by the LNWR in 1879.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/c915644.html|title=Banbury to Verney Junction (LNWR)|accessdaymonth=5 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref>

In July 1846, the [[Wycombe Railway]] was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, allowing the construction of a branch line from [[Maidenhead railway station|Maidenhead]], in [[Berkshire]] on the GWR to [[High Wycombe]], a major furniture producing town. Construction began in 1852 and was completed two years later in 1854. Building works included a new bridge over the Thames; the [[Bourne End Railway Bridge]] was wooden when first built, but replaced by an iron truss bridge in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0011357|title=Bourne End Railway Bridge|accessdaymonth=7 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> The line was single track and used the broad-gauge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmpa.org.uk/history.html|title=Local History, The Wycombe Railway Company|accessdaymonth=7 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> The Wycombe Railway was extended in 1862 to [[Thame railway station|Thame]] with another branch from [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] to [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]] in 1863.<ref group=A>There was no connection to the LNWR station at [[Aylesbury High Street railway station]]</ref><ref name="P.R'boro">{{cite web|url=http://www.broadgauge.org.uk/oldsite/history/line-wycombe.html|title=The Wycombe Railway|accessdaymonth=7 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> The line to [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] was completed a year later in 1864. The Wycombe Railway was leased to the Great Western Railway, and was bought by the GWR in 1867. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1870.<ref name="P.R'boro"/>

Two lines serving [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in Berkshire opened in 1849- both competing for traffic from the Royalty and tourists. The ''Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway'' was authorised in 1847, the [[Staines to Windsor Line]] opening its first section from [[Staines]] in Surrey to [[Datchet railway station|Datchet]] in Buckinghamshire on 22 August 1848. Due to opposition from both Windsor Castle and Eton College, the line into Windsor was delayed- the line into [[Windsor & Eton Riverside railway station|Windsor & Eton Riverside]] opened on 1 December 1849.<ref name=trwws>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesweb.co.uk/windsor/windsorhistory/railways/railway.html|title=The Railways at Windsor|publisher=The Royal Windsor Web Site|accessdate=July 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> The Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway was absorbed by the [[London and South Western Railway]] (LSWR) in 1848.<ref name="trwws"/> In the same year, 1849, the [[Slough to Windsor & Eton Line]] opened from [[Slough railway station|Slough]] in Buckinghamshire to [[Windsor & Eton Central railway station|Windsor & Eton Central]] again receiving opposition from Eton College. Originally laid as broad-gauge, dual gauge, allowing standard and broad gauge trains to run was laid in 1862.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steamindex.com/gwrj/gwrj4.htm|title= Windsor Branch workings in the Postwar Years, abstracts from Great Western Railway Journal Volume 4|accessdaymonth=10 Januray|accessyear=2009}}</ref> For a brief period between 1883 and 1885, the [[Metropolitan District Railway]] ran services between London and Windsor & Eton Central via [[Ealing Broadway Station|Ealing Broadway]] over the GWR tracks from Slough. <ref>{{cite web|http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/district.html|title=Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides, District Line|accessdaymonth=10 Januray|accessyear=2009}}</ref>

The [[Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway]] was formed next in August 1860 to build a line between Aylesbury<ref group=A>The current GWR Aylesbury station, not the LNWR Aylesbury High Street</ref> and Verney Junction on the LNWR ''Buckinghamshire Railway''. It opened in 1868 but trains never ran to Buckingham- even though Verney Junction had a connection to Banbury via Buckingham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/metropolitan.html|title=Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides, Metropolitan Line|accessdaymonth=7 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/v/verney_junction/index.shtml|title=VERNEY JUNCTION|accessdaymonth=7 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> From 1871, services to ''Waddesdon Road'' operated over the [[Brill Tramway]] began. Known initially as the ''Wooton Tramway'', it was built primarily for the use of the [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Third Duke of Buckingham]] and extended to [[Brill]] in 1872, terminating quite a distance from the village itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/c790685.html|title=QUAINTON ROAD TO BRILL (Wotton Tramway)|accessdaymonth=7 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=K.|title=The Wotton Tramway (Brill Branch)|year=1974|publisher=Oakwood Press|location=Lingfield|page=75|isbn=0-85361-149-1}}</ref>

===Metroland===
[[File:Metro-land-map.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Map of "Metro-land", from the 1924 Metro-land booklet published by the Metropolitan Railway. The county boundary of Buckinghamshire is shown.]]
The [[Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways|Metropolitan Railway]] had been the first underground mass-transit railway system in the world when it opened in 1863.<ref name=tflmet>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/modesoftransport/tube/linefacts/?line=metropolitan|title=Metropolitan line facts|accessdaymonth=10 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> In 1868 the [[Metropolitan and St John's Wood Railway]] opened a branch from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] to [[Swiss Cottage]], that company being taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1879.<ref name="tflmet"/> The line was extended several times from then onwards. The line first entered Buckinghamshire on 8 July 1889 to [[Chesham tube station|Chesham]]<ref name=Metland>''[[Metro-land (TV)|Metro-land]]''' by John Betjeman, BBC Television 1973</ref> but further extension into the [[Chiltern Hills]] took place via [[Amersham station|Amersham]] in 1892, turning the Chesham route into a branch line.<ref name="Metland"/> The extension of 1892 terminated at the GWR station in Aylesbury which had opened in 1863.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Metropolitan Line: An Illustrated History|last=Horne|first=Mike|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|year=2003|pages=96|isbn=1854142755}}</ref>

The Metropolitan Railway was now stretching deep into Buckinghamshire, over land termed [[Metroland]] by the Met itself in 1915.<ref name="Metland"/> In 1891, the Metropolitan had absorbed the ''Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway'' which had ran from Aylesbury to Verney Junction. On 1 January 1894, the Metropolitan Railway was extended over the A&BR to [[Verney Junction]] meeting the LNWR owned [[Buckinghamshire Railway]] which had opened in 1850.<ref name=LUSpread>{{cite book|title=The Spread of London's Underground|last=Demuth|first=Tim|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|location=Harrow|year=2004|page=11|isbn=185414 277 1}}</ref> The Metropolitan Railway (popularly called the 'Met') thus ran express services from central London to Verney Junction, in the middle of rural Buckinghamshire- a testament to this being that the terminus was so rural that the station was named after the local landowner, Sir Harry Verney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://underground-history.co.uk/verney.php|title=Metropolitan - from Quainton Road to Verney Junction|accessdaymonth=11 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> The Met's final extension in Buckinghamshire was over the [[Brill Tramway]] which was absorbed on 1 December 1899, almost fifty miles out of central London.<ref name="LUSpread"/> Indeed the extent of the [[Metropolitan line]] was so great that for many years the line could not be accommodated into the London Underground [[Tube map]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mr Beck's Underground Map|last=Garland|first=Ken|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|location=Harrow|year=1994|isbn=185414 168 6}}</ref>

===The last main line===
The next railway which was to weave its way through Buckinghamshire was the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] which had formed a netowrk of railways in the north of England. In 1897, it changed its name to become the [[Great Central Railway]] in anticipation of it's London Extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportarchive.org.uk/timeyear.php?l=l&c=1800&d=1890&y=1897&rpy=906&n=1|title=The Transport Archive Timeline, Key Events from 1897|accessdaymonth=12 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> The MS&LR had been a modest company, until [[Sir Edward Watkin]] became general manager in 1854.<ref name=GCRhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcrailway.co.uk/About_Us/history.aspx|title=History, Great Central Railway|accessdaymonth=12 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> His ambition was to build a rail tunnel under the [[English Channel]] in which his trains would run. He was determined to build a line south to London and the South Coast- to do this he became chairman of both the [[South Eastern Railway]] which ran between London and [[Dover]] and the Metropolitan Railway. Both companies were of use to Watkin as they provided a clear route between Dover and the already existing MS&LR near [[Nottingham]].<ref name="GCRhist"/>

The London Extension was planned to European standards and had virtually no sharp corners or steep inclines. There was to be no level crossings- everything was carried above or below the railway.<ref name=GCRhist2>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatcentraltoday.com/gcrhistory.htm|title=London Extension 1899 - 1969|accessdaymonth=12 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref> Work began in 1894 still under the MS&LR name. The estimated coast was approximately <U+00A3>3 million and would take four years to complete; the project being in to halves, the southern section running from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] in Warwickshire to [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]] which was the Metropolitan Railway's junction for Brill and Verney Junction. From there, trains would share tracks with the Met to a new terminus at [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]] in London.<ref name="GCRhist2"/> The line officially opened on 9 March 1899, although the first passenger service did not run until 16 March.<ref name="GCRhist"/><ref name="GCRhist2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportarchive.org.uk/timeyear.php?l=l&c=1800&d=1890&y=1899&rpy=46&n=1|title=The Transport Archive Timeline, Key Events from 1899|accessdaymonth=12 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwayarchive.org.uk/stories/pages.php?enum=LE129&pnum=1&maxp=3|title=Opening to Grouping - 1899 to 1923|accessdaymonth=12 January|accessyear=2009}}</ref>

==Road==
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}
Buckinghamshire (including Milton Keynes) is served by four motorways, although two are on its borders:
* [[M40 motorway]] - cuts through the south of the county serving towns such as High Wycombe and Beaconsfield
* [[M1 motorway]] - serves Milton Keynes in the north
* [[M25 motorway]] - passes into Bucks but has only one junction (J16-interchange for the M40)
* [[M4 motorway]] - passes through the very south of the county with only J7 in Bucks

Also the [[A41 road (Great Britain)#Watford to Tring|A41(M)]] comes into Buckinghamshire from the east to [[Aston Clinton]].

Four important A roads also enter the county (from north to south):
* [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] - serves Milton Keynes
* [[A41 road|A41]] - cuts through the centre of the county, serving [[Aylesbury]]
* [[A40 road|A40]] - parallels M40 through south Bucks and continues to [[central London]]
* [[A4 road (England)|A4]] - serves [[Taplow]] in the very south

Road travel east<U+2013>west is good in the county because of the commuter routes leaving London for the rest of the country. There are no major roads that run directly between the south and north of the county (e.g. between High Wycombe and Milton Keynes).
