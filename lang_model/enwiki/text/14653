'''Beijing National Day School''', or '''Beijing October First School''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: <U+5317><U+4EAC><U+5341><U+4E00><U+5B66><U+6821> or <U+5317><U+4EAC><U+5E02><U+5341><U+4E00><U+5B66><U+6821>) was established in 1952. The school was affiliated to [[People's Liberation Army]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] as the unique school for PLA's high level officers' children. It opened to recruit students from 1964 and became a general high school of Beijing, and no longer belongs to the PLA. It is located in [[Yuquanlu]], [[Haidian District]], [[Beijing]], [[China]].

== History ==
[[Image:Bjshiyi.JPG|thumb|right|Jiangshuaiyulinbei (<U+5C06><U+5E05><U+8BED><U+6797><U+7891>), the inscriptions of more than 100 leaders, officeholders and Generals of PLA. The ex-president of PRC, [[Jiang Zemin]], inscribed "gardener" ("<U+56ED><U+4E01>") to encourage the Teachers and Students of Beijing National Day School]]

The pre-existence of National Day School was a special elementary school named "October First Elementary School of Central Military Commission" (<U+519B><U+59D4><U+5341><U+4E00><U+5C0F><U+5B66>). The elementary school was established in September 1952 by the Central Military Commission of People's Republic of China, and sanctioned by [[Marshal]] [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Zhu De]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[Zhou Enlai]]. The school was set up for educating the children of martyrs, officers who fought in the Korean War, and high-level officers of PLA.

October First Secondary was established in 1952 under the PLA management. The first principal of the school was Lin Yueqin (Marshal [[Luo Ronghuan]]'s spouse), the vice-principal was Yu Shen (Lieutenant General [[Xiao Xiangrong]]'s spouse). The school was exclusively for high level PLA officers' children, from establishment until 1964. The school history from 1952 to 1964 was very little. Most of the graduates from October First school in that period joined the PLA.

== List of Principals ==
* [[Lin Yueqin]](1952~1986)
* [[Li Jinchu]](1987~2007)
* [[Li Xigui]](2008~present)

== Naming ==
Nie Rongzhen, Marshal of PRC, named the school. The name "October First" means the date of [[national day]] of PRC, October 1 and the date, October 1 ,also normally tread as the memorial day for school establishing. It is remarkable that the '''October First Secondary School''' (Chinese:<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+5341><U+4E00><U+5B66><U+6821>) and the '''Beijing No.11 Middle School''' <U+5317><U+4EAC><U+7B2C><U+5341><U+4E00><U+4E2D><U+5B66><U+FF09>are two different schools, although the two schools' Chinese names are similar.

== School Establishment ==
In the early era of the school, most buildings were one or two floors. A popular spot in the early years of the school was the '''Pentagon Garden'''. During the period from 1952 to 1992, that area included the main buildings in the school.

A rebuilding project of the school started in the middle of the 1990s. The school administrator planned to enlarge the campus. Then in the late 1990s, the Junior High School Building, school library, and Senior High School buildings were constructed. In 2002, the sport field and laboratory building were closed for reconstruction, but then the laboratory was reopened due to a classroom shortage; however, the old "laboratory building" was no longer used as a laboratory. In fact, the new laboratory has already replaced the older facility and the old laboratory building was removed in 2006.  

From 2006 to late 2007, some new buildings, such as an underground library, overseas students' building, artistic building and athletic building, were completed.  These were all part of the second phase of the enlargement project. The school's main entrance was changed from the north gate to the western gate.

== Student Societies and activity ==
=== Student Societies ===
The student's leagues of October First school are classified as '''''S'''chool-'''L'''evel '''L'''eagues'' and '''''N'''on-School-'''L'''evel '''L'''eagues''. Whole the financial problem of SLL would be settled from school budget ; for NSLL, all fees and money for their leagues are collected on their own. Mostly, Leagues recruit new members in the start of each term, and anyone who wants to set up a new league, must apply to the school administrator office in that period.

Every April and November there are two periods for league activities and exhibits. Sometimes, the school administrator office may upgrade some of the better activities, and bestow the award "Elite League".

All leagues are nominally managed by the Student Union and Communistic Youth League Committee of October First School, however the Student Union and CYLC have no jurisdictional powers. The Student Union is considered the same as a special SLL.

The permanent student activities of school are Moot, flea market and student gymkhana. These three are school level activities, which means there are supported by the school administrator. In addition, there are some other activities, for example, Christmas parties, New Year parties in classes and dormitories, and a mid-autumn party, which are held voluntarily and the school administrator neither supports nor bans.
