The importance and antiquity of '''education in Kerala''' is underscored by the state's ranking as among the most literate in the country. The local dynastic precursors of modern-day Kerala made significant contributions to the progress on education in Kerala. There were many ''sabha mathams'' that imparted [[Vedas|Vedic]] knowledge. Apart from ''kalaris'', which taught martial arts, there were village schools run by Ezhuthachans or Asans. The history of western education in Kerala can be traced to [[Christian missionaries]] who set up a number of schools and colleges. These institutions played significant roles in shaping the course of education in Kerala. 

== Organisation ==

The schools and colleges in Kerala are run by the government or private trusts and individuals. Each school is affiliated with either the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE), the [[CBSE|Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), or the [[Kerala State Education Board]]. English is the language of instruction in most private schools, but government run schools offer both English and Malayalam as medium. After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll at [[junior college|Higher Secondary School]] in one of the three streams<U+2014>[[liberal arts]], [[commerce]] or [[science]]. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional degree programmes.
