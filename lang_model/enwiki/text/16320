"'''Kissing You'''" (or "'''I'm Kissing You'''") is a song by British singer [[Des'ree]]. It was written by the singer with Timothy Atack for [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s 1996 film ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]''. The song was included on the film's [[Romeo + Juliet (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] and Des'ree's third studio album, ''[[Supernatural (Des'ree album)|Supernatural]]'' (1998). A [[pop music|pop]] [[ballad]] set in [[A major]], the record uses a simple instrumentation consisting only of [[piano]] and [[string instrument]]s. "Kissing You" featured in ''Romeo + Juliet'' when the title characters meet at a ball. The song was well-received by critics for its emotional melody and toned-down production. Released as a [[single (music)|single]] in in 1997, it appeared on the [[ARIA charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A [[music video]] accompanied the single, which included scenes from ''Romeo + Juliet''.

"Kissing You" has been covered by [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] (2007), [[Taylor Dayne]] (2008) and [[Stan Walker]] (2010). Knowles filmed a music video for her rendition, which she retitled "Still in Love (Kissing You)". The change of title and music video went against copyright terms, and thus Des'ree's publishers filed a lawsuit against Knowles and her representatives. Infringing albums were recalled, and both parties agreed that the case be dismissed with [[prejudice (legal procedure)|prejudice]].

====Music video====
A music video for the song was shot and directed by Cliff Watts, who had also shot Knowles' ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' cover.<ref name="backstage"/> The video for the song served as the closing clip for the ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'', and was filmed on [[Super 8 mm film]] in [[Miami]].<ref name="backstage"/> Knowles discussed the music video with [[MTV]], stating that, "[The video] feels like something you shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video.

You can see my soul."<ref name="behind2"/> In an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' Knowles recalled the video, "I didn't have any hair and makeup.

It is what it is."<ref name="Vibe"/>

====Lawsuit====
Des'ree's [[music publisher (popular music)|publishers]], the Royalty Network, filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Sony BMG]], Sony BMG Sales Enterprise, Knowles, B-Day Publishing and EMI April Music, claiming that Knowles' cover of the song infringed copyright conditions.<ref name="snag"/> On 13 February 2007, Knowles' representatives had sought permission to use [[interpolation (music)|interpolations]] of "Kissing You". The Royalty Network offered Knowles the use the song under certain terms. Two of the conditions of the proposal were that the song's title remain the same, and that the song was not published in video form.<ref name="over"/> Knowles made no further contact with the Royalty Network, and planned to release "Still in Love (Kissing You)" and its video, regardless of the two requested conditions, which the Royalty Network called "completely unacceptable".<ref name="over"/> The publishing company requested that [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (SME)&mdash;the parent company of Columbia Records&mdash;halt distribution of ''B'Day'' with the retitled song. Nevertheless, the album was released on 3 April 2007; the Royalty Network considered the action "willful disregard", and retracted their permission to use the song.<ref name="over"/> The lawsuit, filed on 16 April 2007 in the Manhattan Federal Court, sought [[United States dollar|US$]]150,000 and a recall of the infringing material.
The same day, SME ceased distribution of both the deluxe edition of ''B'Day'' and the anthology video album,<ref name="over"/> although the editions had sold over 214,000 copies before the recall.<ref name="snag">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003577645 |title=
