'''Allan Pilkey''' (born {{circa|1945}}) is a former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  He served as alderman and [[mayor]] of [[Oshawa]], and was a [[New Democratic Party of Ontario|New Democratic Party]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1990 to 1995.

==Background==
Pilkey's father, [[Cliff Pilkey]], was also a New Democratic Party [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP) and a prominent organizer for the party.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan Pilkey, MPP Parliamentary History|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/members/members_all_detail.do?locale=en&ID=420|accessdate=23 November 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101128223308/http://ontla.on.ca/web/members/members_all_detail.do?locale=en&ID=420| archivedate= 28 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He is married to Heather and they have two children.<ref name="stripes">{{cite news |title=Pilkey don pin-stripes to become Oshawa's mayor |first=Stan |last=Josey |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 1981 |page=10}}</ref>

==Oshawa alderman and mayor==
At age 23, Pilkey was elected as an alderman to Oshawa council in 1968.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Oshawa mayor backs regional setup |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=December 3, 1968 |page=26}}</ref> In 1978 Pilkey challenged Walter Beath for the position of chairman to Durham Regional Council. The council held a vote, the result being a 15-15 tie between Pilkey and Beath. Beath in his position as chairman, voted for himself to break the tie and thus retained the position of chairman.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oust Durham chairman, mayor asks Davis |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=December 12, 1978 |page=8}}</ref>

In 1980 he ran for mayor of Oshawa against the incumbent James Potticary and won. He ran on a platform of bringing more industry to Oshawa.<ref>{{cite news |title=3 of 12 mayors unseated in areas around Metro |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=November 11, 1980 |author=Canadian Press |page=A15}}</ref> As mayor he also sat on Durham Regional Council.<ref name="stripes"/> He was acclaimed in the 1982 election,<ref>{{cite news |title=Jim-dandy, cracker-jack men are shoo-ins for mayoralty |first=Rudy |last=Platiel |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=October 20, 1982 |page=10}}</ref> but in 1985 he faced stiffer opposition. A ratepayer group called ''Ward System Now'' successfully lobbied to change the elect-at-large system for councillors to a ward system, a change that Pilkey opposed. William Longworth, the founder of the group intended to run against Pilkey but in the end he was faced by rookie Mary Smith who jumped into the race at the last minute. She said "[she wanted] to give the voters a choice". Pilkey won the election by 16,651 to 7,186 votes. Prior to the election there were four councillor and the mayor. The new council consisted of the mayor, 10 councillors from 10 wards who would also sit on the regional council plus an additional five councillors elected from a combined two wards each.<ref>{{cite news |title=Big chagnes to three councils in Durham |first=Kevin |last=Donovan |newspaper=Toronto Star |page=6 |date=November 19, 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Civic Election '85: Ward system forced on councillors |last=Platiel |first=Rudy |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=October 8, 1985 |page=A19}}</ref> In 1988 he was easily reelected by a 3 to 1 margin over challenger Mike Labaj.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oshawa Council |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=November 22, 1988 |page=E2}}</ref>

During his time as mayor, Pilkey oversaw a period of economic growth in Oshawa. While this was mirrored generally across the country, Pilkey also managed to reduce debt by controlling municipal budgets through reduced hiring and prudent spending.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oshawa's Pilkey runs on his record |last=Bolender |first=Keith |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=November 8, 1988 |page=E20}}</ref>

==Provincial MPP==
In early 1990 there were rumours that Pilkey would seek the nomination for the federal riding of [[Oshawa (electoral district)|Oshawa]] after NDP leader [[Ed Broadbent]] announced his retirement. In the end local MPP [[Mike Breaugh]] sought and won the nomination.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike Breaugh running for Oshawa seat |first=Daniel |last=Girard |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=January 25, 1990 |page=E2}}</ref>

In the summer of 1990, Pilkey ran as the NDP candidate in the riding of [[Oshawa (provincial electoral district)|Oshawa]]. He easily beat his Liberal and Conservative challengers by taking nearly 61% of the votes.<ref name="1990results"/> Oshawa council appointed councillor Allan Mason to replace him after he resigned as mayor.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mason is unanimous choice to replace Pilkey as mayor |first=Phinjo |last=Gombu |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=September 20, 1990 |page=E13}}</ref>

The NDP won a majority government in this election under the leadership of [[Bob Rae]], and Pilkey was appointed to [[cabinet minister|cabinet]] on October 1, 1990 as [[Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Employment (Ontario)|Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Rae Cabinet |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |date=October 1, 1990 |page=A1}}</ref> 

===Industry, Trade and Technology===
During his time in this ministry he presided over a time of a general downturn in the economy that saw many plant closings and job layoffs. Pilkey was criticised for failing to establish proper communication between the business community and the government. On July 31, 1991, Pilkey was named [[Solicitor General (Ontario)|Solicitor General]] and [[Minister of Correctional Services (Ontario)|Minister of Correctional Services]] and replaced by the more experienced [[Ed Philip]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Painful surgery for Rae's cabinet |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=August 1, 1991 |page=A16}}</ref>

===Correctional Services===
Pilkey was involved in a controversy with a Hamilton facility for training prison guards that ultimately resulted in his removal as Correctional Services Minister. During 1992 several allegations surfaced of sexual assault and intimidation of female prison guards at the facility. As a consequence, his role as [[Minister of Correctional Services (Ontario)|Minister of Correctional Services]] was transferred to [[David Christopherson]] on September 24, 1992.<ref>{{cite news |title=NDP shuffles minister in jail-rape case |first=Matt |last=Maychak |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=September 24, 1992 |page=A3}}</ref>

===Solicitor General===
One of the first issues that Pilkey confronted was the issue of [[Sunday shopping]]. While the party had campaigned for the need for a 'common pause day' which Pilkey said was "not up for negotiation", court case decisions and increasing public demand led to a reversal of this policy. In June 1992 Pilkey tabled amendments to the Retail Business Holidays Act to allow shopping seven days a week except on statutory holidays.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ontario allows Sunday shopping |newspaper=Edmonton Journal |date=June 4, 1992 |page=A10}}</ref>

Another contentious issue was the handling of investigations of police conduct by the [[Special Investigations Unit]]. The SIU which was setup by the previous Liberal Peterson government was supposed to handle investigations whenever police officers were involved in a shooting. In the spring of 1991 a secret deal was worked out where some police force investigations were allowed to take precedence over the SIU's business. This deal was widely criticised by the public and Pilkey led a drive to rescind the deal in January 1992.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deal on police probes scrapped |first=John |last=Duncanson |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=January 21 1992 |page=A6}}</ref>

Cuts to the budget of the Ontario Provincial Police also proved to be a problem. The police union stoked fears that the cuts would endanger public safety. This was dismissed as fear-mongering by Pilkey. He said, "I do welcome their suggestions but I really do believe if someone is trying to paint a Draconian, desperate picture, it perhaps is a reach."<ref>{{cite news |title=Police union fear-mongering, solicitor general says |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |date=February 14, 1992 |date=A11}}</ref>

Another initiative led to a doubling of the number of native constables on Ontario reserves. The agreement was made between the Indian Commissioner of Ontario, [[Bud Wildman]], the provincial minister responsible for native affairs, [[Doug Lewis]], the federal Solicitor General and several native leaders.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pact doubles number of native constables on Indian reserves |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=April 7, 1992 |page=8}}</ref>

As Solicitor-General, Pilkey promoted legislation requiring police officers to file a report every time they unholstered their weapons.  Despite protests from police officers, this bill became law on January 1, 1993.

Notwithstanding his success on this front, Pilkey's performance as a cabinet minister was criticized by others within the NDP.  On February 3, 1993, he was demoted to a [[minister without portfolio]] responsible for municipal affairs.  He held this position until 1995.

In 1994, Pilkey was one of twelve NDP MPPs to vote against [[Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act|Bill 167]], a government bill which would have extended spousal benefits to same-sex couples. This decision cost him considerable support within the NDP.

The NDP were defeated in the [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995 provincial election]], and Pilkey lost the Oshawa riding to [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[Jerry Ouellette]] by over 8,000 votes.
