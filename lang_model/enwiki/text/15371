Lieutenant colonel '''Anthony William Durnford''' (1830&ndash;1879) was a career [[British Army]] officer of the [[Royal Engineers]] who served in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]]. [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]]ed colonel, Durnford is mainly known for his presence at the defeat of the British Army by the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]]s at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]].

==Background==
Durnford was born into a military family at Manor Hamilton, [[County Leitrim]], [[Ireland]] on 24 May 1830.<ref name=Greaves165>Greaves (2011), p.165-167</ref> His father was General Edward William Durnford, also of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=rdvc>Young, rorkesdrift.com</ref> His younger brother, Edward, also served in the British military, as a lieutenant-colonel in the [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine Artillery]]. During his formative years he lived with his uncle in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], [[Germany]].

In July 1846 Durnford returned to England to enter the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Woolwich]] and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the Royal Engineers in 1848 initially serving at [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] and [[Scotland]]. Between 1851 and 1856 he served in [[Ceylon]],<ref name=Greaves165 /> stationed at [[Trincomalee]], where he provided distinguished assistance in designing the harbour. In 1853 Durnford was instrumental in saving portions of the harbour defences from destruction by fire.

Durnford volunteered for service in the [[Crimean War]] but was not accepted. He was transferred in 1856 to [[Malta]] as an intermediate posting, but did not see active service either in the Crimea or in the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] of 1857. He served in Malta as an adjutant until February 1858, when he was promoted to Second [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=22137|startpage=2298|date=7 May 1858|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> and posted back to Chatham and [[Aldershot Command|Aldershot]] in England. Between 1861 and 1864 Durnford commanded No. 27 Field Company, Royal Engineers, at [[Gibraltar]].

In 1864, promoted to Captain,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=22809|startpage=262|date=19 January 1864|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> he was transferred to [[China]], but was invalided back to England while in transit due to [[Heat illness|heat]] [[apoplexy]].<ref name=Greaves165 /> After his recovery, Durnford spent the next six years at [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]] and [[Dublin]] on routine garrison duties. In 1871 he received a posting to [[South Africa]].

==South African duty==
On 23 January 1872, he arrived in [[Cape Town]], still never having seen active service.

He was however promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] on 5 July 1872<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=23876|startpage=3194|date=16 July 1872|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> and [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant colonel]] on 11 December 1873.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24043|startpage=5778|date=9 December 1873|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>

Of the 16 months following his arrival in the Cape, Durnford spent the greater portion at [[King William's Town]]. In a letter to his mother he wrote of the blacks: '' . . they are at least honest, chivalrous and hospitable, true to their salt, although only barbarians. They are fine men, very naked and all that sort of thing, but thoroughly good fellows''. He appears to have adhered to his idealistic picture throughout the remaining years of his life.

He was later stationed at [[Pietermaritzburg]], where he was befriended by [[John William Colenso|Bishop Colenso]] and he joined [[Theophilus Shepstone]] on an expedition to crown King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]].<ref name=Greaves165 /> He saw some action during the pursuit of [[Langalibalele]] at Bushman's River Pass, where he showed great courage but received two assegai stabs, one in his side, the other in his elbow; severing a nerve thus paralysing his left under-arm and hand for the rest of his life. Durnford managed to shoot two of his assailants with his revolver and to extricate himself. His Natal Carbineers had abandoned him, but his loyal [[Lesotho|Basuto]] troopers stood by him.

In 1878 Durnford, as the senior Royal Engineer officer in the colony, served on Sir [[Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer|Henry Bulwer]]'s Boundary Commission to investigate the disputed border between the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and the [[Zulu Kingdom]].  Later that year he was tasked to plan the formation of an African auxiliary force which soon became the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC)<ref name=Greaves165 />

==Anglo-Zulu War==
{{main|Battle of Isandlwana}}
He was one of the most experienced officers of the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] --"commanding presence, untiring energy and undoubted powers of leadership", he was also apt to be headstrong, and was threatened with loss of command by [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]]. Assigned to lead the No. 2 Column of Chelmsford's invasion army, Durnford commanded a mixed force of African troops including the Natal Native Horse and a detachment of the 1st Regiment Natal Native Contingent.

On 20 January, Durnford's force was ordered to [[Rorke's Drift]] to support Chelmsford's column. That evening, a portion of the No. 2 Column under Durnford arrived at Rorke's drift and camped on the Zulu bank where it remained through the next day.

Late on the evening of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to [[Isandlwana]], as was a small detachment of No. 5 Field Company, [[Royal Engineers]], commanded by Lieutenant [[John Rouse Merriott Chard|John Chard]], which had arrived on the 19th to repair the [[Pontoon bridge|pontoon]]s which bridged the Buffalo. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke's Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford's column ''en route'' in the opposite direction.

Around 10:30am on the morning of 22 January, Durnford arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with five troops of the Natal Native horse and a rocket battery. A [[Royal Engineers|Royal Engineer]], Durnford was superior in rank to Brevet Lt-Col [[Henry Pulleine]], who had been left in control of the camp. This put the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition would have assumed command. (Pulleine's rank was Brevet Lieutenant Colonel. In other words he was still being paid as a major.) Durnford did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions, however, and after lunch he quickly decided to take the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.

Durnford was killed during the resulting battle, and was later criticised for taking men out of the camp thus weakening its defence.<ref name=Gazette24695>{{London Gazette|issue=24695|startpage=2199|date=15 March 1879|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> His policy though, was in effect to ride to the sound of the guns, "and attack the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] wherever they appeared", and was well respected by his native [[Basutos]]. It must be added, moreover, that the actions of Durnford and his command effectively halted the left horn of the Zulu army until their cartridge boxes began to run dry. This was no small accomplishment considering the Left Horn included the inGobamakhosi regiment, "The Benders of the Kings".  Their ammunition supply expended, Durnford and his troopers fought their way back to the "saddle" that separated the wagon park from the rest of the camp. In one last valiant effort, Durnford perished with a handful of his troopers as the horns of the Zulu army engulfed the camp.

Among the causes of the disaster were the ill-defined relationship between Durnford and Pulleine, brought about by failures of [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]]'s command and control, a lack of good intelligence on the size and location of Zulu forces which resulted in Chelmsford splitting his force and, most decidedly, Chelmsford's decision not to fortify the camp (which was in direct violation of his own standing pre-campaign orders).

==Popular culture==
In the 1979 film [[Zulu Dawn]], which depicted the battle of Isandlwana,  Durnford was portrayed by [[Burt Lancaster]].
