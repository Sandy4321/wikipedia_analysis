==Background and development==
Women's football in Africa in general faces several challenges, including  limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses.<ref name="Williams2007-186">{{cite book|author=Jean Williams|title=A Beautiful Game: International Perspectives on Women's Football|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VuIp04RvKX8C&pg=PA157|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=15 December 2007|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-674-1|page=186}}</ref>  At the same time, if quality female players in Africa are developed, many leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities in places like Northern Europe or the United States.<ref name="Kuhn2011">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Kuhn|title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BwmsLxiWvnwC&pg=PA34|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=24 February 2011|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-60486-053-5|page=34}}</ref> Funding for women's football in Africa is also an issue:  Most of the funding for women's football and for the women's national teams comes from [[FIFA]], not the national football association.<ref name="Kuhn2011" />

The development of football on a national level in Cape Verde is hindered by several factors, including local definitions of femininity that discourage participation in sport, lack of adequate training, a lack of competitive spirit in matches and during training.<ref name=canarayislands/>  There is also a lack of available players, with participation rates having peaked at roughly 350 a few years back to roughly 200 current players.<ref name=canarayislands/>  The lack of opportunities to go further with football inside the country also discourages continued participation in the sport.<ref name=canarayislands/>

Some female Cape Verdan footballers have gone on to play internationally for clubs in places like the [[Canary Islands]] with some of the earliest players joining clubs around 2001.
