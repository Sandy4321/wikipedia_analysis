== Diseases ==
{{see also|Category:Cat diseases}}

===Infectious disease===
An [[infectious disease]] is caused by the presence of organisms such as [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], or [[parasite]]s (either [[animal]]ian or [[protozoa]]n).  Most of these diseases can spread from cat to cat via airborne pathogens or through direct or indirect contact. Certain infectious diseases are a concern from a [[public health]] standpoint because they are [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] (transmittable to humans).

==== Viral ====
[[Virus|Viral]] respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in [[cattery|catteries]] and [[kennel]]s.  Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats.<ref name=Carter>{{cite web|author=Carter, G.R.; Flores, E.F.; Wise, D.J.|year=2006|title=Herpesviridae|work=A Concise Review of Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap11/chapter.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref> Timely vaccination can reduce the risk and severity of an infection. Feline viral rhinotracheitis is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide.  The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is the feline calicivirus.

*[[Feline viral rhinotracheitis]] (FVR) is an upper respiratory infection of [[cat]]s caused by feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), of the family ''[[Herpesviridae]]''.  It is also known as '''feline influenza'''.  FVR is very contagious and can cause severe disease, including death from [[pneumonia]] in young kittens.  All members of the ''[[Felidae]]'' family are susceptible to FVR,
*[[Feline calicivirus]] (FCV)
*[[Chlamydophila felis]]
*[[Feline panleukopenia]] (FPV) more commonly known as feline distemper is caused by the feline [[parvovirus]], a close relative of [[canine parvovirus]]. It is not related to [[canine distemper]]. Panleukopenia is primarily spread through contact with an infected cat's bodily fluids, feces, or fleas.
*[[Feline leukemia virus]] (FeLV) is a [[retrovirus]] transmitted between infected cats when the transfer of saliva or nasal secretions is involved, for example when sharing a feeding dish. If not defeated by the animal<U+2019>s [[immune system]], the virus can be lethal. The disease is a virus, not a cancer.  The name stems from the fact that the first disease associated with the virus was a form of leukemia.  By the time it was discovered that the virus was not the same as leukemia, the misnomer had already found its way into the vocabulary of pet owners.
*[[Feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV), commonly known as Feline AIDS is a [[lentivirus]] that affects domesticated housecats worldwide. FeLV and FIV are in the same [[Family (biology)|biological family]], and are sometimes mistaken for one another. However, the viruses differ in many ways. Although many of the diseases caused by FeLV and FIV are similar, the specific ways in which they are caused also differs.
*[[Feline infectious peritonitis]] (FIP)' is a fatal, incurable disease caused by Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), which is a mutation of Feline Enteric [[Coronavirus]] (FECV/FeCoV). The mutated virus has the ability to invade and grow in certain [[white blood cell]]s, namely macrophages.  The immune system's response causes an intense [[inflammation|inflammatory reaction]] in the containing tissues.  This disease is generally fatal<ref>[http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/fip.html Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. However its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5000 for households with one or two cats.<ref>[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pets_fip ASPCA: Pet Care: Cat Care: Feline Infectious Peritonitis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
*[[Rabies]] in cats is a fatal disease transmitted by the bite of an infected [[mammal]], such as a [[dog]], [[raccoon]], [[bat]], or another cat. Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease. Rabies is rare in many developed countries with more than 99% of all human deaths from rabies occurring in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]] which report thirty thousand deaths annually.<ref name=WHO_stats>{{cite web | title = Rabies vaccine | work = WHO - Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals | url = http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/rabies.shtml | accessdate = 2006-04-20}}</ref> In the United States, cats make up 4.6% of reported cases of rabies infected animals.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17696853 Rabies surveillance in the United States during 2006.]</ref>

*[[Heart valve dysplasia]]
*[[Luxating patella]]
*[[Portosystemic shunt]]. Found in Persians and [[Himalayan]]s.

===Skin disorder===
{{see|Cat skin disorders}}
Cat skin disorders are among the most common health problems in cats. Skin disorders in cats have many causes, and many of the common skin disorders that afflict people have a counterpart in cats. The condition of a cat's skin and coat can also be an important indicator of its general health. Skin disorders of cats vary from acute, self-limiting problems to chronic or long-lasting problems requiring life-time treatment.

*[[Cheyletiella]] is a mild [[dermatitis]] caused by [[mite]]s of the [[genus]] '''''Cheyletiella'''''.  It is also known as '''walking dandruff''' due to skin scales being carried by the mites.  ''Cheyletiella'' live on the skin surface of [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[human]]s.
*[[Feline acne]]
*[[Feline eosinophilic granuloma]]
*[[Flea allergy dermatitis]]
*[[Hyperthyroidism]]
*[[Miliary dermatitis]] (feline [[eczema]])
*[[Mange]]

*[[Stomach cancer in cats and dogs|Stomach cancer]]

=== Other diseases ===
*[[Cerebellar hypoplasia (non-human)|Cerebellar hypoplasia]] is a disorder found in cats and dogs in which the [[cerebellum]] is not completely mature at birth. Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, [[tremors]] and generally [[motor skills|uncoordinated motion]].  The animal often falls down and has trouble [[walking]].  Tremors increase when the animal is excited and subside when at ease.
*A [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcer]] is an inflammatory condition of the [[cornea]] involving loss of its outer layer.  It is very common in [[dog]]s and is sometimes seen in [[cat]]s.
*[[Diabetes in cats and dogs|Diabetes]]
*[[Epilepsy in animals|Epilepsy]] is characterized by recurrent unprovoked [[seizure]]s. Epilepsy in cats is rare likely because there is no hereditary component to epilepsy in cats. 
*[[Feline asthma]]
*[[Feline Hepatic Lipidosis]] also known as Feline Fatty Liver Syndrome, is one of the most common forms of [[liver disease]] of cats.<ref>[http://www.healthypet.com/library_view.aspx?ID=42&sid=2 Welcome to Healthypet.com!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The disease begins when the cat stops eating from a loss of appetite, forcing the liver to convert body fat into usable energy.
*[[Feline lower urinary tract disease]] is a term that is used to cover many problems of the feline [[urinary system|urinary tract]], including [[bladder stone (animal)|stones]] and [[cystitis]]. The term feline urologic syndrome is an older term which is still sometimes used for this condition. It is a common disease in adult cats, though it can strike in young cats too. It may present as any of a variety of urinary tract problems, and can lead to a complete blockage of the urinary system, which if left untreated is fatal.

==Diet and nutrition==
{{see|cat food}}{{see also|pet food}}
Veterinarians commonly recommend commercial [[cat food]]s that are formulated to address the specific nutritional requirements of cats although an increasing number of owners are opting for home-prepared cooked or [[raw feeding|raw diets]].

Although cats are [[obligate carnivore]]s, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] cat food are preferred by owners uncomfortable with feeding animal products to their pets. The US [[FDA]] [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] has came out against vegetarian cat and dog food for health reasons.<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/ent/pop/articles/0518vegpets18-CR.html Vegetarian dogs and cats: Kibble doesn't cut it anymore<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (

Cats can be selective eaters. Although it is extremely rare for a cat to deliberately starve itself to the point of injury, in obese cats, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called [[Feline Hepatic Lipidosis]], a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours.

[[Pica]] is a condition in which animals chew or eat unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this is mostly harmless as they do not digest most of it, but can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Burmese, Oriental, Siamese and breeds with these in their ancestry.

===Food Allergy===
[[Food allergy]] is a non-seasonal disease with skin and/or gastrointestinal disorders. The main complaint is [[Pruritus]], which is usually resistant to treatment by [[steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before the onset of clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components for at least two years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]] / flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with [[dietary elimination-challenge trials]]. [[Provocation testing]] is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Verlinden| first = A.| coauthors = Hesta, M., Millet, S., Janssens, G.P.| year = 2006| month = 4-5| title = Food Allergy in Dogs and Cats: A Review| journal = [[Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition]] ([[Taylor & Francis]])| volume = 46| issue = 3| pages = 259<U+2013>273

===Malnutrition===
[[Malnutrition]] has been seen in cats fed homemade or vegetarian/vegan diets produced by owners with good intentions, and most published recipes have been only crudely balanced (by computer) using nutrient averages. Because the palatability, [[digestibility]], and [[food safety|safety]] of these recipes have not been adequately or scientifically tested, it is difficult to characterize all of these homemade diets. Generally, most formulations contain excessive [[protein]] and [[phosphorus]] and are deficient in [[calcium]], [[vitamin E]], and [[microminerals]] such as [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[potassium]]. Also, the [[energy density]] of these diets may be unbalanced relative to the other [[nutrients]]. Commonly used meat and carbohydrate ingredients contain more [[phosphorus]] than [[calcium]]. Homemade feline diets that are not actually deficient in [[fat]] or [[energy]] usually contain a [[vegetable oil]] that cats do not find [[palatable]]; therefore, less food is eaten causing a [[calorie deficiency]]. Rarely are homemade diets balanced for [[microminerals]] or [[vitamins]]. Owner neglect is also a frequent contributing factor in malnutrition.<ref>{{cite web

===Toxic substance===
Some houseplants are harmful to cats. For example, the leaves of the [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter Lily]] can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage to cats, and [[Philodendron]] are also poisonous to cats. The [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] has a full list of plants harmful to cats.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cfainc.org/articles/plants.html | title = Plants and Your Cat | publisher = The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc. | accessdate = 2007-05-15}}</ref>

[[Paracetamol]] or acetaminophen (trade name [[Panadol]] and [[Tylenol]]) is extremely toxic to [[cat]]s, and should not be given to them under any circumstances. Cats lack the necessary glucuronyl transferase enzymes to safely break paracetamol down and minute portions of a normal tablet for humans may prove fatal.<ref name="CanVetJ2003-Allen">{{cite journal | author=Allen AL | title=The diagnosis of acetaminophen toxicosis in a cat | journal=Can Vet J | year=2003 | pages=509<U+2013>10 | volume=44 | issue=6 | pmid=12839249}}</ref> Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation and discolouration of the tongue and gums. After around two days, liver damage is evident, typically giving rise to [[jaundice]]. Unlike an overdose in humans, it is rarely liver damage that is the cause of death, instead [[methaemoglobin]] formation and the production of [[Heinz bodies]] in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing [[asphyxiation]]. Effective treatment is occasionally possible for small doses, but must be extremely rapid.

==Signs that a cat requires veterinary attention==

The following symptoms require urgent veterinary attention:
Straining non-productively, breathing through the mouth, difficulty breathing, gums that are white or blue, fitting for longer than one minute, collapse. You should also take your cat to the vets urgently if it has been involved in a road traffic accident, fallen from a height, eaten anything poisonous or has been exposed to smoke. There are many other symptoms for which a cat requires veterinary attention.
