'''Josef <U+017D><U+00E1><U+010D>ek''' ( born May 26, 1951 in [[Prague]]) is a Czech [[painting|painter]]. From 1977 to 1983, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Prague]].

Josef <U+017D><U+00E1><U+010D>ek's own visual language was based on geometric signs and later figural symbols through which he came to address universal issues of cultural identity and memory as well as wholly concrete phenomena of the contemporary world. 
His monumental canvases is usually monochrome composition.

In 1989 he had exhibition at the Youth Gallery, which featured canvases in abstraction shapes on the theme of [[The Gospel of Matthew|The Gospel of St Matthew]]. In 1994 Josef <U+017D><U+00E1><U+010D>ek exhibited a series of paintings at the Beh<U+00E9>mot Gallery that were inspired by events that had occurred in 1993 in Bad Kleinen.  The series of evocative portraits of wanted members of the [[Red Army Faction|R.A.F.]] entitled ''Searching in Lost Space'' is not a celebration of violent solutions, rather it highlights how society has evolved in an unnatural direction. In 1995 at  Prague City Gallery  he presented the large composition ''Madonna of Prosperity'', an allegory of [[Albrecht D<U+00FC>rer]]<U+2019>s  [[Feast of the Rosary|<U+2018>Feast of the Rose-garlands<U+2019>]], portraying in sign-form a striking phenomenon of the new age: consumerist madness.

Another of Josef <U+017D><U+00E1><U+010D>ek<U+2019>s most striking series of paintings are  Universe (1998), Eyes of the City (2002), The Genius Loci( 2004), Altar of Dreams (2005), Dream of the Apocalypse (2007), The Landscape (2010).
