'''Richard Yates''' ([[January 18]], [[1818]] - [[November 27]], [[1873]]) was governor of [[Illinois]] during the [[American Civil War]] and has been considered the greatest war [[governor]] during that period. When the war began Gov. Yates sent more Illinois troops to aid the Union than any other state. He also represented Illinois in the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[1851]]-[[1855]] and as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]],  [[1865]]-[[1871]].

Yates was born in [[Warsaw, Kentucky]] and moved with his family to Illinois in [[1831]].  He was graduated from [[Illinois College]] in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]], in [[1835]].  He then studied law at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. He was admitted to the bar in [[1837]] and commenced practice in Jacksonville.

Yates served as a member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] from [[1842]]-[[1845]] and [[1848]]-[[1849]].  In 1850, he was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to the United States House of Representatives where he was the youngest member of the [[Thirty-second United States Congress|Thirty-second Congress]]. He was reelected to Congress in 1852.  During Yates' second term in Congress, the repeal of the [[Missouri Compromise]] reopened the [[History of slavery in the United States|anti-slavery question]]. He opposed the repeal, and became identified with the new [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].  His district was pro-slavery and consequently he narrowly lost his bid for a third term.

In 1860 he was elected governor as a Republican. Governor Yates continued to be an outspoken opponent of slavery, and at the opening of the Civil War was very active in raising volunteers. He convened the legislature in extra session on [[12 April]], [[1861]], the day after the attack on [[Fort Sumter]], and took military possession of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], garrisoning it with regular troops. In Governor Yates's office General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] received his first distinct recognition as a soldier in the Civil War, being appointed by Yates mustering officer for the state, and afterward colonel of the 21st Illinois regiment.  In [[1862]], he attended the Loyal [[War Governors' Conference]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], which ultimately gave [[Abraham Lincoln]] support for his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

After his service as governor ended, Yates was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1865, to March 3, 1871; he was not a candidate for reelection. While in the Senate, Yates was Chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims ([[Thirty-ninth United States Congress|Thirty-ninth]] and [[Forty-first United States Congress|Forty-first Congress]]es) and Chairman of the Committee on Territories ([[Fortieth United States Congress|Fortieth Congress]]).

After leaving the Senate, Yates was appointed by President Grant as a United States commissioner to inspect a land subsidy railroad.  He died suddenly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on November 27, 1873.  He is buried in Diamond Grove Cemetery, Jacksonville.  

In [[1923]] a statue of Yates by [[Albin Polasek]] was erected on the [[Illinois State Capitol]] grounds.

His son, also [[Richard Yates (son)|Richard Yates]], was also active in Illinois politics, including a term as governor.
