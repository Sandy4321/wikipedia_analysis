'''Alisher Saipov''' ({{lang-uz|''Alisher Soipov'', ''<U+0410><U+043B><U+0438><U+0448><U+0435><U+0440> <U+0421><U+043E><U+0438><U+043F><U+043E><U+0432>''}}) (September 4, 1981 &ndash; October 24, 2007) was a [[Kyrgyzstani]] journalist of [[uzbeks|Uzbek]] ethnic origin and editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''[[Siyosat]]'' of the country's ethnic Uzbek minority, which reported on human rights abuses in neighboring [[Uzbekistan]]. Saipov often wrote articles critical of Uzbek President [[Islam Karimov]] and his government. He wrote extensively about torture in Uzbek prisons, the clampdown on dissent, and the rise of [[Islamic radicalism]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Antelava|first=Natalia|title=The silencing of Uzbekistan's voice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7073388.stm|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=3 November 2007|month=|year=}}</ref> He also worked as a correspondent for [[RFE/RL]] and [[Voice of America]].

A Kyrgyz citizen of Uzbek ethnicity, Saipov had aggressively covered Uzbekistan<U+2019>s political scene. A month before his slaying, state-controlled Uzbek media had smeared Saipov in publications and broadcasts. He reported being followed by Uzbek security agents.

Natalia Antelava from [[BBC News]] reported: "At twenty-six, Alisher Saipov was one of the most outspoken journalists in [[Central Asia]].  (...) He wrote extensively about torture in Uzbek President [[Islam Karimov]]'s prisons, about the clampdown on dissent and the plight of the Uzbek refugees living in Kyrgyzstan."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7061171.stm|title= Outspoken Uzbek reporter killed|author= Natalia Antelava|date=25 October 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 October 2007}}</ref>

In 2007 and 2008, Kyrgyz investigators said they were probing allegations that Uzbek security agents might have been involved in the murder.

In April 2009, officials announced that they had detained a suspect and recovered the murder weapon. The case first reached first the Osh City Court in late July 2009. Judge Koichubek Zhobonov found insufficient evidence to proceed and sent the case back to investigators. On appeal, prosecutors succeeded in overturning the decision and having the trial judge replaced.

On December 9, 2009 Kyrgyzstan<U+2019>s Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution of the suspect [[Abdufarit Rasulov]], a former policeman, could proceed. This ruling came in the appeal filed in late October 2009 by Avaz Saipov, the father of Alisher, because in the first handling of the case, investigators had left numerous questions unanswered and failed to address several apparent discrepancies. The suspect has denied involvement in the murder and has said that police beat him, the independent news Web site Uznews reported.<ref>[http://cpj.org/2009/12/kyrgyzstan-court-rejects-new-probe-in-saipov-murde.php "Kyrgyzstan court rejects new probe in Saipov murder"]</ref>

The Kyrgyz Supreme Court ruled that the case of Saipov should be sent back to an Osh city court for further investigation. This ruling meant that the investigation would be conducted by the same court that presided over the initial, inconclusive investigation. Saipov<U+2019>s father had filed the appeal hoping that his son's murder would be examined by a different court. He had insisted that evidence showed that his son was killed by agents from Uzbekistan in retaliation for critical articles he wrote.

According to critics, the confusion and contradictions around the investigation granted a de facto impunity to Saipov<U+2019>s killers and raised questions about the commitment of the Kyrgyz government<U+2019>s commit to solving the case.ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/Kyrgyz_High_Court_Returns_Journalists_Murder_Case_To_Osh_Court/1899852.html|title= Kyrgyz High Court Returns Journalist's Murder Case To Osh Court|date=9 December 2009|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Saipovs_Murder_Still_Unsolved/1901708.html |title= Investigation, Impunity Continue|date=11 December 2009|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>
