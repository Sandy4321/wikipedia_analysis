'''St Iestyn's Church, Llaniestyn''' is a medieval church in [[Llaniestyn, Anglesey|Llaniestyn]], [[Anglesey]], in north Wales. A church is said to have been founded here by [[Iestyn (saint)|St Iestyn]] in the 7th century, with the earliest parts of the present building dating from the 12th century.  The church was extended in the 14th century, with further changes over the coming years.  It contains a 12th-century font and a 14th-century memorial stone to Iestyn, from the same workshop as the stone to St Pabo at [[St Pabo's Church, Llanbabo]].

The church is still in use, as part of the [[Church in Wales]], and is one of five churches in a combined parish.  It is a [[listed building|Grade II* listed building]], a designation given to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/upload/resourcepool/WhatIsListing_englishLR983.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> because of its age and retention of many original features, including the Iestyn effigy.

==History and location==
[[File:Entrance to St Iestyn.jpg|thumb|left|The west and south sides of the church <U+2013> the old door (far left) and the newer porch (centre) can be seen.]]
The date of foundation of the church in [[Llaniestyn, Anglesey|Llaniestyn]], [[Anglesey]], is unknown, although it is thought that [[Iestyn (saint)|St Iestyn]], a nephew of the Anglesey saint [[Cybi|St Cybi]], established a religious community in this place in the 7th century.<ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|pages=107<U+2013>108|isbn=1845270894|publisher=Carreg Gwalch|last=Jones|first=Geraint I. L.|year=2006}}</ref> It was the last of the churches that he established.<ref name=Pev/> According to the 19th-century writer [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], the church was donated by [[Llywelyn the Great]] to the priory he had established at [[Llanfaes]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47853#s15|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales |year=1849|chapter=Llaniestyn (Llan-Iestyn)|accessdate=14 June 2010|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Lewis (publisher)}}</ref> It is known that there was a church here before 1254 as it is recorded in the [[Annates#England|Norwich Valuation]] of that year. The oldest parts of the building, including the blocked west door, date back to the 12th century.  There was an extension to the chancel, probably in the 14th century; the east window is 15th-century, and the south door dates from about 1500.  The 16th century saw the addition of the south transept.  Restoration work took place in 1865 (renewing the roof and adding the north window) and in 1954, when the west door was discovered.

The church, which is part of the [[Church in Wales]], stands in a churchyard in a rural part of eastern Anglesey, near the village of [[Llanddona]].<ref name=List/> It is one of five churches in the combined parish of Llansadwrn with Llanddona and Llaniestyn with Pentraeth with Llanddyfnan, part of the [[deanery]] of Tindaethwy, within the [[archdeaconry]] of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in the [[Diocese of Bangor]].<ref name=CinW>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinw.org/rb/par.php?dosommat=detail&which=288|title=Church in Wales: Benefices|accessdate=14 June 2010|publisher=[[Church in Wales]]}}</ref> The church gave its name to the area: the Welsh word "{{lang|cy|[[llan (placename element)|llan]]}}" originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", with the saint's name as a suffix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/religion.shtml|title=Religion and creed in place names|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

==Architecture and fittings==
[[File:St Iestyn effigy.jpg|thumb|left|The effigy of St Iestyn]]
The church was built using rough [[rubble masonry]] with stone [[coping (architecture)|coping]]s, with some parts covered in [[Stucco|render]].<ref name=List/>  The [[chancel]] and [[nave]] together measure 38&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches by 15&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches (11.66 by 4.72&nbsp;m); the south transept is {{convert|18|by|15|ft|m}}.<ref name=RC>{{cite book|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|pages=106<U+2013>107|chapter=Llaniestyn Rural}}</ref> The internal walls have been whitewashed.<ref name=Anglesey/> The roof is made of [[slate]].  There is no change in the structure to denote the internal division between the nave, which is the oldest part of the building, and the chancel.  There is a [[bellcote]] at the west end of the roof. The church entrance is through a porch on the south side; it has been rebuilt, with some of the material dating from the 15th century. There is a round-headed door inside a square door frame, with the date 1764 on the hinge.<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5545|title=Church of St Iestyn|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|date=2009|accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=RC/>

The east window in the chancel is in the shape of a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with [[cinquefoil]]s and a [[hood mould]]. On the north side of the nave there is a rectangular window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with [[trefoil]]s in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century.<ref name=List/> The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.<ref name=Pev>{{cite book|title=The Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd|page=145|chapter=Anglesey: Llanddona |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300141696|year=2009|last=Haslam|first=Richard|last2=Orbach|first2=Julian|last3=Voelcker|first3=Adam}}</ref>

The west wall of the south transept holds a late 14th-century carved effigy stone of St Iestyn; he wears a hooded cloak with a broach, holding a staff in his right hand and an inscribed scroll in his left.  He is bearded and has the appearance of a hermit,<ref name=List/> or of a [[Franciscan]] monk (Samuel Lewis commenting that the cord and tassel hanging from the girdle around his waist were similar to those worn by monks in that order).<ref name=Lewis/>  There are flowers in the background.<ref name=List/> The inscription reads ''{{lang|lat|H[I]C : JACET : SANGTUS : YESTINVS : CVI : /WEN[LLIA]N [F : MADO] C : ET : GRVFFVT : AP : GWILYM : O[BT]VLIT : IN OB/LACOEM : ISTAM : IMAGIN/NE : P : SALVTE : ANIMARVM : S}}'' ("Here lies Iestyn to whom Gwenllian ferch Madog and Gruffydd ap Gwilym offered this image for the health of their souls").<ref name=Anglesey/><ref name=List/> It is made of grey [[sandstone]], from [[Flintshire]] in north-east Wales <U+2013> an area where the donor of the effigy, Gruffudd ap Gwilym, had land.  He also had land at Llaniestyn, and it is probable that he paid for rebuilding work at the church. The woman appearing in the inscription was Gruffudd's aunt. The stone originates from the same workshop as similar memorials in the area: there is one at [[Bangor Cathedral]], and one to St Pabo at [[St Pabo's Church, Llanbabo]] (also on Anglesey).  The stone may originally have been used as part of a shrine for the saint. It was positioned in front of the altar in the 18th century, but was thereafter moved to its present location.<Ref name=Pev/>

The cylindrical font, at the west end of the nave, is from the 12th century. The outside of the font is decorated with carvings in three bands.  The bottom band contains round-headed arches, the middle band has a series of chevrons, and the top band has various crosses, chequerwork patterns and other decorations.<ref name=List/> It has similarities of design and style with the font at [[St Peulan's Church, Llanbeulan]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd|page=142|chapter=Anglesey: Llanbeulan|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300141696|year=2009|last=Haslam|first=Richard|last2=Orbach|first2=Julian|last3=Voelcker|first3=Adam}}</ref> There is an 18th-century stone tablet recording benefactions to the poor of the parish on the north wall of the chancel.  The communion table and rails date from the late 17th century.<ref name=RC/>

==Assessment==
[[File:Font at St Iestyns Church, Llaniestyn.jpg|thumb|left|The 12th-century font]]
The church is a Grade II* [[listed building]] <U+2013> the second-highest (of three) grade of listing, designating "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed because it is a "good Medieval rural church which retains many original and early features".<ref name=List/>  [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales) particularly notes the "fine 14th-century effigy memorial" of St Iestyn.<ref name=List/>

Samuel Lewis called it "one of the plainest churches in the island of Anglesey", describing the "remarkably curious" font and the effigy as "two highly interesting relics".  The image of St Iestyn, he said, was "surpassed in antiquarian value by few monumental effigies in Wales."<ref name=Lewis/> A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region notes the "barn-like" entrance of the porch, and describes the effigy of St Iestyn as "surprisingly accomplished".<ref name=Pev/>
