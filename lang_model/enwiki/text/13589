'''''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX'''''|<U+904A><U+2606><U+622F><U+2606><U+738B><U+30C7><U+30E5><U+30A8><U+30EB><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30BA>GX|Y<U+016B>gi<U+014D> Dyueru Monsut<U+0101>zu J<U+012B> Ekkusu}}, is an [[anime]] [[spin-off]] of the original ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise. The anime first premiered in Japan on [[October 6]], [[2004]].

''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' follows the exploits of [[Jaden Yuki]] and his companions as he attends Duel Academy.

==History==
The ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX'' anime aired [[October 6]], [[2004]] on [[TV Tokyo]]. It was subsequently licensed by [[4Kids Entertainment]] and adapted into English with the title ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'', picked up by [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States, [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada, ITV2 and [[Nicktoons UK]] in the United Kingdom, [[Canal J]] and [[M<U+00E9>tropole 6|M6]] in France, [[RTL II]] in Germany, [[Italia 1]] in Italy, [[Network Ten]] in Australia, [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in New Zealand, [[ABS-CBN]] and [[Hero (channel)|Hero TV]] in the Philippines, [[TV3 Lithuania|TV3]] in Lithuania, [[China Television System|CTS]] in Taiwan, [[RT<U+00C9> Two]] in Ireland, [[MBC 3]] in UAE, [[Cartoon Network (Worldwide)|Cartoon Network]] in Denmark, [[MTV3]] and [[Subtv|Subtv Juniori]] in Finland, [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in Brazil and Mexico, [[A+ (TV channel)|A+]] in Hungary and Romania. In North America, the program is distributed by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Television Animation]] in addition to 4Kids Entertainment.

A [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|manga spin-off]] of the series written by [[Kazuki Takahashi]], illustrated by [[Naoyuki Kageyama]], and published by [[Shueisha]]'s Jump Comics division's ''[[V-Jump]]'', began serialization on [[December 17]], [[2005]]. The manga was later adapted into English and made its debut in the [[Weekly Shonen Jump#United States Shonen Jump|United States ''Shonen Jump'']] magazine December 2006. 

===Production===
''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' is produced by [[Nihon Ad Systems]], Inc., and directed by Hatsuki Tsuji.<ref name="A">{{cite web|title=Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX Televising Data|work=|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~flying-in-the-sky/on-air-data.htm|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> Scripts are prepared by an alternating lineup of writers<U+2013>Shin Yoshida, Jun Maekawa, Akemi Omode, Yasuyuki Suzuki<U+2013>with music arrangements by Yutaka Minobe.<ref name="A"/> Takuya Hiramitsu is in charge of sound direction, supervised by [[Y<U+016B>ji Mitsuya]]. Character and monster designs are overseen by Kenichi Hara, while Duel layout is overseen by Masahiro Hikokubo.<ref name="A"/>

The "GX" in the series' title is short for the term "Generation neXt". "GENEX" was also the tentative title of the series as evidenced in early promotional work, and also refers to the GX tournament that takes place between episodes 84 and 104.

Like many English adaptations of other anime series, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' is edited due to [[Americanization]] and the shifting of the target demographic toward a younger audience. The names of many characters and cards underwent alteration, and card faces and text are edited to only include ATK/DEF statistics and Attribute for monsters, and card type for Spells and Traps. Spell Cards in particular are referred to as such to reflect the revised printing format that surfaced in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]] from ''[[Magician's Force]]'' onwards, though the original term "Magic Card" has been used on several occasions, either due to scripting error or for very specific reasons. Furthermore monster stat displays and Life Point counters, previously in blue and gold print, become digital readouts with color-coded energy bars. The original music score is replaced with a [[techno]]-style soundtrack. Darker and more controversial themes such as death, murder (and mass murder), and religion<U+2013>which were incorporated into the Japanese version<U+2013>are virtually absent in the English interpretation.

==Themes and structure==
Although the first half of the anime's first season began on a whimsical note, the latter half established a noticeably darker atmosphere by introducing [[supernatural]] elements similar to those present in the original ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' franchise, such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], the [[Shadow Game (game)|Shadow Game]]s, and various myths, along with [[Judeo-Christian]] subtext. The second season had a strong thematic presence built on [[destiny]], with ties to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and associated [[horror fiction]] authors writing in the [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian milieu]], and drew on [[space opera]] as a plot device (see also [[Space opera in Scientology scripture]]). The third season continued this trend, but with much greater emphasis on emotional torment, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]]s serving as its primary settings.

The program is divided into episodes classified as "Turns". The [[title sequence]] and [[closing credits]] are accompanied by lyrics varying over the course of the series, with the former immediately followed by an individual episode's number and title. [[Eyecatch]]es begin and end commercial breaks halfway through each episode; in the first season, there were two eyecatches per episode, usually showcasing the opponents and their key monsters for a given episode while in later seasons, a single eyecatch appears with only the duelists. After the credits, a preview of the next episode, narrated most frequently by [[KENN]] and [[Masami Suzuki]], is made, followed by a brief "Today's Strongest Card" segment.

In the English version, the title sequence is accompanied by the song "Get Your Game On!", as are the end credits (in a shortened form). Eyecatches, previews, and the "Today's Strongest Card" featurette are removed entirely.

==Story==
In the [[fictional universe]] of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'', a popular Duel Monsters card game created by [[Maximillion Pegasus]] (Pegasus J. Crawford) is widely enjoyed. Referred to as a "duelist," a player of the game summons [[monster]]s and activates Spell and Trap Cards through [[Duel Disk]] technology to evoke various strategies to defeat his/her opponent in battle. A Duel typically begins with each contestant being given a life total of 4000 Life Points, which can be decreased as opposing players "attack" him/her with their monsters or trigger the abilities of individual cards. The objective is to reduce an opponent's Life Points to zero, and therefore be declared the winner. Although conceived as a mere card game, Duel Monsters' roots are mythological in nature, and many exploit its unworldly secrets for their own purposes. 

''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' begins with the lead character Jaden Yuki obtaining a ''Winged Kuriboh'' card from [[Yugi Mutou]], the renowned Duel Monsters champion, while on his way to a {{nihongo|'''Duel Academy'''|<U+30C7><U+30E5><U+30A8><U+30EB><U+30FB><U+30A2><U+30AB><U+30C7><U+30DF><U+30A2>|Dyueru Akademia|Duel Academia in the Japanese version}} entrance exam. 

The Academy was created by [[Seto Kaiba]] on a remote island in the Southern Seas, with its dormitories named after the three [[Egyptian God Cards]], and is run by '''Chancellor Sheppard''' (Samejima) and his staff.<ref name="B">''Yu-Gi-Oh! (Duel Monsters) GX'' Episode #1, 2004</ref> The most elaborate dormitory, {{nihongo|'''Obelisk Blue'''|<U+30AA><U+30D9><U+30EA><U+30B9><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30D6><U+30EB><U+30FC>|Oberisuku Bur<U+016B>}}, is named after ''[[Obelisk the Tormentor (card)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]''. The Obelisk Blue dormitory can be graduated to, but the only way to enter the dormitory in the first year is to attend and do well at an affiliated junior school (English version only).<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! (Duel Monsters) GX'' Episode #55, 2005</ref> As the highest ranked dormitory, Obelisk Blue's facilities are of the highest quality, on the level of the world's classiest hotels and restaurants. The center dorm, {{nihongo|'''Ra Yellow'''|<U+30E9><U+30FC><U+30FB><U+30A4><U+30A7><U+30ED><U+30FC>|R<U+0101> Ier<U+014D>}}, is named after ''[[The Winged Dragon of Ra]]''. Those who were given the highest scores in the entrance exam, or who only did mediocrely in the junior school enter this dormitory,<ref name="B"/> which, while not as extravagant as Obelisk Blue, still has incredibly clean and well-kept facilities and meals of a quality far above the lifestyle of the average salaryman. The lowest dormitory, {{nihongo|'''Slifer Red'''|<U+30AA><U+30B7><U+30EA><U+30B9><U+30FB><U+30EC><U+30C3><U+30C9>|Oshirisu Reddo|Osiris Red in the Japanese version}}, is named after ''[[Slifer the Sky Dragon]]''. Those who failed completely or scored poorly are put into the shoddy quarters of Slifer Red.<ref name="B"/>

There are four other branches of Duel Academy worldwide, in the North, East, South, and West.

For the first two years at Duel Academy, the main cast faces major threats including the [[Shadow Riders]] (Seven Stars), who intend to revive the [[Sacred Beast Cards|Sacred Beasts]] by creating a strong dueling presence on the island,<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! (Duel Monsters) GX'' Episode #48, 2005</ref> as well as the [[Society of Light]], which intends to enslave humanity with the mind control satellite of Misgarth.<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' Episode #84, 2006</ref> During the third year, Duel Academy is transported to another world<U+2013>a desert plane with three suns and resident Duel Monster spirits<U+2013>right into the hands of the [[Martin Empire]].<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! (Duel Monsters) GX'' Episode #120, 2007</ref> Upon returning home, Jaden and a select group of his partners dive into the rift left in their escape to recover their missing companions, and embark through second and third worlds where losing a Duel is fatal.

==Cast==
{{seealso|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX minor characters}}

''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' sports many personalities. The principal cast is composed of series hero [[Jaden Yuki]], the passionate [[Alexis Rhodes]] and her  brother [[Atticus Rhodes|Atticus]], the easily discouraged but determined [[Syrus Truesdale]], elitist [[Chazz Princeton]], the analytic [[Bastion Misawa]], the strong-willed [[Tyranno Hassleberry]], and the love-struck [[Blair Flannigan]]. Supporting characters often have connections to the educative or professional dueling worlds, and include Obelisk Blue professor [[Vellian Crowler]], duelist-turned-Industrial Illusions designer [[Chumley Huffington]], and Pro League powerhouses [[Zane Truesdale]] and [[Aster Phoenix]]. A group of foreign duelist champions would also find a place in Duel Academy's student body in the third year.

Antagonists of the series range from elderly [[Shadow Riders#Kagemaru|Kagemaru]] to the manipulative [[Sartorius (Yu-Gi-Oh! GX)|Sartorius]] and the deranged [[Martin Empire#Yubel|Yubel]].
