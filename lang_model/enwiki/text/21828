'''Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl''', 731 S.E.2d 550 (S.C. 2012), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of South Carolina]] held that a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (Indian) child could not be adopted to non-Indian parents without complying with the requirements of the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]] and ordered the child returned to her father.

In 2009, without properly notifying the Indian father, a couple from South Carolina sought to [[adopt]] an Indian child from her non-Indian mother in Oklahoma.  The father, a decorated Army veteran, contested the adoption in both the trial court and on appeal, at the state supreme court, winning at both levels.  The case has been widely published in the main-stream media, focusing on the story from the side of the couple that attempted to adopt the child.

The ICWA applies to "Indian children", which are defined as "any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an [[Indian tribe]] or (b) is eligible for [[Blood quantum laws|membership]] in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe."<ref>{{usc|25|1903(4)}} (1988); Snyder, at 821.</ref>  Additionally, in the case of a voluntary [[adoption]] of an Indian child, the parents must waive or terminate their parental rights.  The ICWA provides that to do so, an Indian parent must: 1) do so in writing, 2) do so before a [[judge]], 3) who must certify that the parent understood his or her actions, and 4) may not be executed prior to ten days after the child's birth.<ref>{{usc|25|1913(a)}} (1988); Snyder, at 836-37.</ref>  The Indian parent may also withdraw their consent to an adoption at any time prior to a final order or within two years of the final order if their consent was obtain by fraud or duress.<ref>{{usc|25|1913(c)}} (1988); Snyder, at 837-38.</ref>  When consent is withdrawn or if the ICWA procedures are not followed, the Indian child is to be immediately returned to the Indian parent.<ref>{{usc|25|1913(c)}} (1988); Snyder, at 837.</ref>

Tribal rights are also covered by the act.<ref>{{usc|25|1911(c)}} (1988); Snyder, at 828.</ref>  Tribal courts have [[exclusive jurisdiction]] for cases arising on [[Indian reservations]]<ref>''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.

In any case, the tribe has a right to intervene in the proceeding and to act to protect the tribal rights of the child.

=== History ===
Dusten Brown, a member of the [[Cherokee Nation]] was a [[soldier]] serving in the [[United States Army]] at [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]].  Brown was engaged to non-Indian Christina Maldonado, who became pregnant.<ref>''[http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27148.pdf Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl]'', 731 S.E.2d 550, 552-53 (S.C. 2012); ''[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/article/supreme-court-agrees-consider-baby-veronica-case-146773 Supreme Court Agrees to Consider 'Baby Veronica' Case]'', {{smallcaps|Indian Country Today}}, Jan. 4, 2013; ''[http://www.nicwa.org/babyveronica/ The Baby Veronica Case: Information and Resources]'', {{smallcaps|National Indian Child Welfare Association}} (last visited Jan. 17, 2013) (hereinafter cited as NICWA).</ref>  The engagement ended while Maldonado was pregnant,{{#tag:ref|On learning Maldonaldo was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him.  In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 553.</ref>|group=fn}} and a few months prior to the baby's birth, she began to work with an adoption attorney to place the child with Matt and Melanie Capobianco of [[South Carolina]].<ref>Allyson Bird, ''[http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20111231/PC16/312319969 James Island Family turns over 2-year-old Girl Following Court Order]'', {{smallcaps|Charleston Post & Courier}}, Dec. 31, 2011; NICWA.</ref>  Although Oklahoma law requires that an Indian tribe be notified, Maldonado's attorney misspelled Brown's name and provided an incorrect date of birth, so the tribe was not put on notice of the proposed adoption.{{#tag:ref|The pre-placement form indicated: "Initially the birth mother did not wish to identify the father, said she wanted to keep things low-key as possible for the <nowiki>[Appellants]</nowiki>, because he's registered in the Cherokee tribe. It was determined that naming him would be detrimental to the adoption."<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 554.</ref>|group=fn}}<ref>Bird; NICWA.</ref>  After receiving permission from Oklahoma authorities, based in part on the mis-identification of the child as Hispanic instead of Native American, the Capobiancos took the child to South Carolina.{{#tag:ref|There was evidence that had the child been reported as Native American, the Capobiancos would not have been allowed to take the child out of Oklahoma.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 554.</ref>|group=fn}}  Four months after the birth of the child and just days from deployment to [[Iraq]], Brown was served with notice of the proposed adoption.<ref>NICWA.</ref>  Brown signed the document, believing that he was relinquishing rights to Maldanalo.{{#tag:ref|In any event, the release would not have complied with the ICWA, which requires a judge's certification that the parent understood exactly what rights they were signing away.<ref>{{usc|25|1913(a)}}</ref>|group=fn}}<ref>NICWA.</ref>  Brown, once he realized what he was signing, immediately tried to retrieve the document, and failing that, contacted the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General]] at Fort Sill for assistance.<ref>NICWA</ref>  Seven days after being notified of the proposed adoption by the Capobiancos, Brown had obtained a stay of the adoption proceedings and he deployed with his Army unit to Iraq.{{#tag:ref|Brown performed well in Iraq, earning the [[Bronze Star medal]].<ref>NICWA</ref>|group=fn}}<ref>NICWA</ref>

=== Lower courts ===
On Brown's return from Iraq, the adoption case was heard in Charleston County Family Court.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 556; Kinnard, NICWA</ref>  Brown contested the adoption, and the Cherokee Nation intervened in the case.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 555-56.</ref>  The court denied the Capobiancos petition to adopt the child, and ordered that the child be returned to Brown as the biological father.<ref>NICWA</ref>  South Carolina law terminates a father's parental rights if he did not provide pre-birth support and does not become involved with the child shortly after birth, but the court noted that the ICWA [[Federal preemption|preempts]] state law.<ref>Harriot McLeod, ''[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/08/us-adoption-cherokee-idUSTRE8070L720120108 Native American Roots Trump in Adoption Battle over Toddler]'', {{smallcaps|Rueters}}, Jan. 8, 2012.</ref>  On November 25, 2011, the court issued a ruling, holding that 1) the ICWS applied and was not unconstitutional, 2) the "Existing Indian Family" exception was inapplicable in this case, 3) Brown did not consent to the termination of his parental rights or the adoption of his child, and 4) the Capobiancos had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that Brown's parental rights should be terminated.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 556.</ref> The court then ordered the Capobiancos to turn over the child.  This was accomplished on December 31, 2011.<ref>Bird; Kinnard; NICWA</ref>

== Opinion of the court ==
Chief Justice [[Jean H. Toal]] delivered the opinion of a split court on July 26, 2012.{{#tag:ref|The five members of the court split 3-2, with Justices Costa M. Pleicones and Donald W. Beatty joining the majority opinion, while Justice John W. Kittredge, joined by Justice Kaye G. Hearn, dissented.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 550; Kinnard.</ref>|group=fn}}  Toal recited the facts of the case and the procedural history, and then began the analysis of the issues.  The opinion identified three issues to be determined.  First, whether the Capobiancos had improperly removed the child from Oklahoma; second, whether state law or the ICWA is determinative of Brown's status as a parent; and third, whether the Capobiancos met their [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to terminate the parental rights of Brown.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 556.</ref>

Toal noted that the Capobiancos were correct that the removal of the child from Oklahoma was not unsafe, but was incorrect on the issue.  Had Oklahoma been properly notified that this was an Indian child, the Cherokee Nation would have been alerted, and the child's interests as a member of the tribe would have been protected.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 559; Zug.</ref>  She noted that at this point, the case was properly before the court, and proceeded to address the second issue.

The court noted that Capobianos argued that it takes more than mere biology to invoke the provisions of the ICWA.  They argued that under South Carolina law, a father must reside with the mother for the six-month period preceding the birth of the child and to contribute monetarily to pregnancy related expenses in order to have paternity rights.<ref>{{smallcaps|S.C. Code Ann. <U+00A7> 63-9-310(A)(5)}} (2010); ''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 560.</ref>  Toal advised that they were not correct{{endash}}the ICWA does not defer to state law and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 560.</ref>

Toal then turned to the last issue, the trial courts refusal to terminate Brown's parental rights.  The Capobiancos could not show that Brown had agreed to consent to the adoption. The court noted that the ICWA set out clear procedural guidelines on what was needed, and the Capobiancos did not comply with those requirements.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 561.</ref>  The Capobiancos also failed to show by [[Legal burden of proof#Clear and convincing evidence|clear and convincing evidence]] that's Brown's parental rights should be terminated.  Under the ICWA, prior to terminating an Indian parents rights to the Indian child, the party seeking to terminate the rights <U+201C>shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.<U+201D><ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 562 (citing {{usc|25|1912(d)}}).</ref>  The court noted that the Capobiancos made no efforts to comply with this requirement of federal law,<ref>Zug.</ref> but have actively sought to prevent the father from obtaining custody since the child was four months old.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 562.</ref>

The court then addressed the [[best interests of the child]].  Toal said "Where an Indian child's best interests are at stake, our inquiry into that child's best interests must also account for his or her status as an Indian, and therefore, we must also inquire into whether the placement is in the best interests of the ''Indian child''."<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 565 (emphasis in original); Kinnard.</ref> She noted, quoting ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]''<ref>''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at 30.</ref> that this was 'based on the fundamental assumption that it is in the Indian child's best interest that its relationship to the tribe be protected."<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 565 (citing ''Holyfield'', 490 U.S. at 50, n. 24).</ref>{{#tag:ref|''Holyfield'' is the only [[United States Supreme Court]] case to discuss the ICWA.<ref>Zug.</ref>|group=fn}}  Toal stated that the best interest of the child was to be with her father, which also preserves her tribal affiliation.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 565.</ref>

Finally, Toal addressed the placement requirements of the ICWA.  The federal law requires that preference be given to, in this order: 1) with another member of the child's family, 2) another member of the child's tribe, and 3) another Indian family.<ref>{{usc|25|1915(a)}}; ''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 566.</ref>  The court stated that neither Maldonaldo nor the Capobiancos had intended to comply with the statute, and that the Capobiancos could not thereby claim that the breaking of the bond formed by the child with the Capobiancos are grounds from ignoring the statute.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 566.</ref>

The court affirmed the decision of the Charleston County Family Court returning the Indian child to her father, and reiterated that the ICWA preempts state law in the termination of parental rights for Indian parents.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 567; Zug.</ref>

=== Dissent ===
Justice John W. Kittredge, joined by Justice Kaye G. Hearn, dissented.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 567 (Kittredge, dissenting).</ref>  Kittredge indicated that he believed that the state standards for best interest of the child should trump those of the ICWA.  Kittredge concluded that the trial court judge erred in her findings of fact.{{#tag:ref|In almost all appeals, appellate court judges are not permitted to find error in [[questions of fact]], instead limiting themselves to [[questions of law]].  This is because the [[trier of fact]] has the opportunity to observe the witnesses and determine their credibility, while the appellate court judge cannot.<ref>{{smallcaps|John B. Oakley & Vikram D. Amar}}, {{smallcaps|American Civil Procedure: A Guide to Civil Adjudication in US Courts}} 193 (2009).</ref>|group=fn}}<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 568 (Kittredge, dissenting).</ref>  In addition, Kittredge concluded that Brown had "abandoned" his child and should therefore not be allowed to contest the adoption.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 574 (Kittredge, dissenting).</ref>  Finally, he would have ruled that termination of Brown's parental rights was in the best interest of the child.<ref>''Adoptive Couple'', 731 S.E.2d at 576-79 (Kittredge, dissenting); Kinnard.</ref>  He would have reversed the decision of the trial court.

=== Media coverage ===
Coverage in the mainstream media has been extensive.  The [[The Post and Courier|Charleston Post Courier]] ran a series of articles on the case,<ref>Bird.</ref> and the news was picked up by other media outlets.

=== Social media ===
The case has also received a great deal of coverage in [[social media]].  A friend of the Capobiancos started a "Save Baby Veronica" campaign, aimed at gathering grass root support for the couple's efforts to overturn both the Charleston Family Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court decisions.<ref>Michael Overall, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=20120711_11_A5_CUTLIN410485&r=9026 Baby Veronica Adoption Case Lobbyists Move to Congress]'', {{smallcaps|Tulsa World}}, July 11, 2012.</ref>

=== U.S. Supreme Court ===
After the South Carolina Supreme Court declined to rehear the case, Capobiancos filed a petition with the [[United States Supreme Court]] for a ''[[writ of certiorari]]'', the method that the Supreme Court agrees to hear appeals from lower courts.  On January 4, 2013, the Court granted the writ to hear the case.<ref>''Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl'', No.
