The '''2008 Fareham Council election''' took place on 1 May 2008 to elect members of [[Fareham (borough)|Fareham]] [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough]] Council in [[Hampshire]], [[England]]. Half of the council was up for election and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] stayed in overall control of the council.<ref name=change>{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/local_council/08/html/24ue.stm | title = Fareham | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | publisher = ''[[BBC News Online]]''}}</ref>

After the election, the composition of the council was
*[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] 22
*[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] 9<ref name=full>{{cite news | title = National: Full election results | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | page = 45 | date = 2008-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-11-20}}</ref>

==Campaign==
Before the election the Conservatives held 22 seats compared to 9 for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], with the Conservatives having run the council for the previous 9 years.<ref name=issues>{{cite web| url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/briefing/election_news/2222821.The_issues_in_Fareham_and_Gosport/ | title = The issues in Fareham and Gosport | accessdate = 2010-11-20 | date = 2008-04-24 | publisher = ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]''}}</ref> Other candidates stood from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]], [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green party]], [[United Kingdom Independence Party]], [[British National Party]] and the [[English Democrats Party]], but the election was seen as being mainly between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.<ref name=issues/>

Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats pledged to improve parking in [[Fareham]], oppose a proposed gravel extraction site and build less new houses.<ref name=issues/> The Conservatives defended their record in control of the council pointing to low [[council tax]] rates, extra hours of free bus travel for pensioners and recycling at 46% of waste.<ref name=issues/> However the Liberal Democrats promised to revert to weekly [[Waste collection|rubbish collection]] instead of the fortnightly service that was introduced in 2005, improve street cleaning and scrap a fee for calling out [[pest control]]lers.<ref name=issues/>

==Election result==
The results saw no seats change hands with the Conservatives keeping control with a majority of 13.<ref name=blue>{{cite web| url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/briefing/elections/news/2242096.Fareham_remains_true_blue/ | title = Fareham remains true blue | accessdate = 2010-11-20 | date = 2008-05-02 | publisher = ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]''}}</ref> The Conservatives held 12 seats, many with increased majorities, the Liberal Democrats held 3, while Labour failed to win any seats and came last in many [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]].<ref name=raising>{{cite web| url = http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/farehamvotes/Election-2008-Fareham-Tories-celebrate.4044413.jp | title = Election 2008: Fareham Tories celebrate raising game without any gains | accessdate = 2010-11-20 | date = 2008-05-02 | publisher = ''[[The News (Portsmouth)|The News]]''}}</ref> The largest majority was in [[Sarisbury]] where the Conservatives won over 82% of the vote, while the closest results came in [[Stubbington]] and Fareham East, with the Liberal Democrats holding Fareham East by 80 votes after a recount.<ref name=blue/> The only ward to see a new [[councillor]] was [[Titchfield]] where Conservative Tiffany Harper replaced Francis Devonshire, who stepped down at the election.<ref name=raising/> Overall [[Voter turnout|turnout]] in the election was 40.25%.<ref name=results>{{cite web| url = http://www.fareham.gov.uk/pdf/webmaster/results.pdf | title = Election of borough councillors : 1 May 2008 | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | publisher = ''Fareham Borough Council''}}</ref>
