In [[enzymology]], a '''phosphoadenylylsulfatase''' ({{EC number|3.6.2.2}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + H<sub>2</sub>O <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + sulfate

Thus, the two [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of this enzyme are [[3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate]] and [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]], whereas its two [[product (chemistry)|products]] are [[adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate]] and [[sulfate]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[hydrolase]]s, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in sulfonyl-containing anhydrides.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is '''3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate sulfohydrolase'''. Other names in common use include '''3-phosphoadenylyl sulfatase''', '''3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulfate sulfatase''', '''PAPS sulfatase''', and '''3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate sulfohydrolase'''.  This enzyme participates in [[sulfur metabolism]].  It employs one [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], [[manganese]].
