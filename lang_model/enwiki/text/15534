==Biography==
Rachid Arma was born in [[Agadir|Ait Ouidern Resmouka]] and spent his childhood in [[Agadir]]. In 1989, his father left Morocco to move to [[San Bonifacio]], [[Italy]], for work purposes, and the rest of the family, including Rachid, joined him later in 1995.<ref name="spallino_1" /><ref name="spallino_2">{{cite news |url=http://issuu.com/hughes1960/docs/090610143822-a880570028f6450a98cd9_20090610_143948/14 |title=Un uomo solo all'attacco: Arma letale |language=Italian |accessdate=9 September 2009 |date=23 February 2009 |publisher=Lo Spallino}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2004, he was promoted into [[A.C. Sambonifacese|Sambonifacese]]'s first team, and played four consecutive [[Serie D]] seasons with the Venetian club, being instrumental in their promotion to [[Lega Pro Seconda Divisione]] during the 2007<U+2013>08 season thanks to his 21 goals. He was consequently noted by a number of professional clubs, and was acquired by [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione]] outfit [[SPAL 1907|SPAL]] during the 2008 summer transfer window. With SPAL, he immediately managed to achieve some space under the guidance of head coach [[Aldo Dolcetti]], and provided a 13-goal tally in his first professional season. He then achieved national coverage after he managed to score two goals to [[Serie A]] side [[U.S. Citt<U+00E0> di Palermo|Palermo]] in the third round of the [[Coppa Italia 2009<U+2013>10]]; the match ended with a 4<U+2013>2 win for the Sicilians, but Arma was subsequently noted by [[Serie B]] giants [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] and was acquired by the ''granata'' in [[co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal only days after his impressive performance in the Coppa Italia, which also proved to be his final game with SPAL.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/sport/cmsSezioni/quitoro/200909articoli/22399girata.asp|title=Arma, operaio nuovo bomber granata: "Porter<U+00F2> i marocchini a vedere il Toro" |language=Italian |accessdate=9 September 2009 |date=2 September 2009 |publisher=La Stampa}}</ref>

In June 2010, SPAL bought back Arma from Torino. In July 2010, he was acquired by Serie B club [[A.S. Cittadella|Cittadella]] in a co-ownership bid.<ref>{{cite news |language=Italian |accessdate=2010-07-14 |date=2010-07-14 |publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb |url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/?action=read&id=218442 |title=UFFICIALE: Arma al Cittadella}}</ref> On August 31, 2010, Vicenza Calcio acquired the co-ownership from Cittadella. He returned to SPAL for a second spell in July 2011.
