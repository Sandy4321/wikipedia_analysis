Miami and the surrounding [[metropolitan area]] are situated on northern [[Biscayne Bay]] between the [[Everglades]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By population, Miami is the largest city in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] and the [[county seat]], the largest city in the [[South Florida metropolitan area]], which comprises Miami-Dade County, [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], and [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]], making up the largest metropolitan area in the [[Southeastern United States]] and the sixth largest metropolitan area in the United States.  However, based on [[city limits]], it is the second-largest city in Florida (after [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]).
 
Miami was officially incorporated as a city on [[July 28]] [[1896]], with a voting population of just over 300. In 1940, 172,172 people lived in the city.  According to the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 census]], the city proper had a population of 362,470, while the larger metropolitan area had a population over 5.4 million. The [[U.S. Census Bureau]] estimate of the population of Miami in 2004 was 379,724<ref>[http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2004-04-12.xls Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Florida, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2004]</ref>.   

Miami's explosive population growth in recent years has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country as well as by [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. Greater Miami is regarded as a cultural [[melting pot]], heavily influenced both by its large population of ethnic [[Latin America]]ns and [[Caribbean]] islanders (many of them [[Spanish language|Spanish]]- or [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]]-speaking). 

The region's importance as an international financial and cultural center has elevated Miami to the status of [[world city]]; because of its cultural and linguistic ties to [[North America|North]], [[South America|South]], and [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]] it is sometimes called "The Gateway of [[the Americas]]." Florida's large Spanish-speaking population and strong economic ties to Latin America also make Miami and the surrounding region an important center of the [[Hispanic|Hispanic world]]. 

Practically all major foreign countries today maintain consulates in Miami. The city has been involved in numerous political controversies with nearby [[Cuba]] and [[Fidel Castro]], plus wider concerns with [[terrorism]], [[immigration]], and [[illegal drugs|drug issues]] throughout the region. 

==History==
{{main|History of Miami, Florida}} 
The earliest evidence of Native American settlement in the Miami region came from about 12,000 years ago.<ref>Parks, Arva Moore. ''Miami: The Magic City.'' Miami, Fl: Centennial Press, 1991. ISBN 0-9629402-2-4 p 12.</ref> The first inhabitants settled on the banks of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]], with the main villages on the northern banks. 

The inhabitants at the time of first [[European]] contact were the [[Tequesta]] people, who controlled much of southeastern Florida, including what is now [[Miami-Dade County]], [[Broward County]], and the southern part of [[Palm Beach County]]. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased with the rest of the body, and put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the [[Miami Circle]].

[[Juan Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n]] was the first European to visit the area in 1513 by sailing into [[Biscayne Bay]]. His journal records that he reached ''Chequescha'', which was Miami's first recorded name.<ref>Parks, p 13</ref> It is unknown whether he came ashore or made contact with the Indians.<!--But note that ''Chequesta'' is a variant of ''Tequesta''.--> [[Pedro Men<U+00E9>ndez de Avil<U+00E9>s]] and his men made the first recorded landing when they visited the [[Tequesta]] settlement in 1566 while looking for Avil<U+00E9>s' missing son, shipwrecked a year earlier.<ref>Parks, p 14</ref> Spanish soldiers led by Father Francisco Villiareal built a Jesuit mission at the mouth of the Miami River a year later but it was short-lived. After the Spaniards left, the Tequesta Indians were left to fend themselves from European-introduced diseases like [[smallpox]]. By 1711, the Tequesta sent a couple of local chiefs to [[Havana, Cuba]] to ask if they could migrate there. The Cubans sent two ships to help them, but Spanish illnesses struck and most of the Indians died.<ref>Parks, p 14-16</ref>

The first permanent European settlers arrived in the early 1800s. People came from the [[Bahamas]] to South Florida and the [[Florida Keys|Keys]] to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran aground on the treacherous [[Great Florida reef]]. Some accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the [[Seminole]] Indians arrived, along with a group of runaway slaves. The area was affected by the [[Seminole Wars#Second Seminole War|Second Seminole War]], during which Major [[William S. Harney]] led several raids against the Indians. Most non-Indian residents were soldiers stationed at [[Fort Dallas]]. It was the most devastating Indian war in American history, causing almost a total loss of population in the Miami area. 

After the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, [[William English (planter)|William English]], re-established a plantation started by his uncle on the Miami River. He charted the <U+201C>Village of Miami<U+201D> on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later a census reported that there were ninety-six residents living in the area.<ref>[http://www.miamidade.gov/info/history.asp History of Miami-Dade county] retrieved January 26, 2006</ref> The [[Seminole Wars#Third Seminole War|Third Seminole War]] (1855-1858) was not as destructive as the second one. Even so, it slowed down the settlement of southeast Florida. At the end of the war, a few of the soldiers stayed. 
[[Image:JaneTuttle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Julia Tuttle owned 640 acres in the Miami area at the end of the 19th century]]
In 1891, a wealthy [[Cleveland, Ohio]] woman named [[Julia Tuttle]] purchased an enormous citrus plantation in the Miami area, augmenting a smaller plot of land she inherited from her father to make a total of 640 acres. Tuttle<U+2019>s husband, Frederick Tuttle, died in 1886, and she decided to move to South Florida due to the <U+201C>delicate health<U+201D> of her children. She and [[William Brickell]] tried to get railroad magnate [[Henry Flagler]] to expand his rail line, the [[Florida East Coast Railroad]], southward to the area, but he initially declined.

However, in the winter of 1894, Florida was struck by cold weather that destroyed virtually the entire [[citrus]] crop in the  state. A few months later on the night of [[February 7]], [[1895]], Florida was hit by another freeze. That freeze wiped out whatever crops survived the first one, and the new trees. Unlike the rest of the state, Miami was unaffected, and Tuttle's citrus became the only citrus on the market that year. Tuttle wrote to Flagler again, persuading him to visit the area and to see it for himself. Flagler did so, and concluded at the end of his first day that the area was ripe for expansion. He made the decision to extend his railroad to Miami and build a resort hotel.   

[[Image:MiamiAvenue1896.jpg|thumb|250px|Miami Avenue in 1896]]
On [[April 7]], [[1896]] the railroad tracks finally reached Miami, and the first train arrived on [[April 13]]. It was a special, unscheduled train, and Flagler was on board. The train returned to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] later that night. The first regularly scheduled train arrived on the night of [[April 15]]. 

On [[July 28]], [[1896]], the incorporation meeting to make Miami a city took place. The right to vote was restricted to all men who resided in Miami or Dade County. After ensuring that the required number of voters was present, the motion was made to incorporate and organize a city government under the corporate name of <U+201C>The City of Miami,<U+201D> with the boundaries as proposed. and the city was incorporated with 444 citizens.

Miami's growth up to [[World War II]] was astronomical. In 1900, 1,681 people lived in Miami, Florida; in 1910, 5,471; in 1920, 29,571; in 1930, 110,637. As thousands of people moved to the area in the early 1900s, the need for more land quickly became apparent. Up until then, the [[Florida Everglades]] extended eastward to as close as three miles from Biscayne Bay. Beginning in 1906, [[canal]]s were made to remove some of the water from those lands. During the early 1920s, the authorities of Miami allowed [[gambling]] and were very lax in regulating [[Prohibition]], so thousands of people migrated from the northern United States to the Miami region. The catastrophic [[Great Miami Hurricane]] in 1926 caused 373 fatalities and ended a large building boom. Between 25,000 and 50,000 people were left homeless in the Miami area. <ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/miami/peopleevents/pande07.html Great Miami Hurricane] retrieved January 27, 2006</ref> The [[Great Depression]] followed, in which more than sixteen thousand people in Miami became unemployed.<ref>Parks, p 131-132</ref>

On [[February 15]], [[1933]], an assassination attempt was made on President-elect [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by [[Giuseppe Zangara]], an Italian [[anarchist]], while Roosevelt was giving a speech in Miami's [[Bayfront Park]]. Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] of [[Chicago]], who was shaking hands with Roosevelt, was shot and died two weeks later. Four other people were wounded, but President-elect Roosevelt was not harmed. <ref>[http://digital.library.miami.edu/gov/FDRAssn.html Miami archives] retrieved January 21, 2006</ref> 

By the early 1940s Miami was recovering from the Great Depression, but then [[World War II]] started. Many of the cities in Florida were heavily affected by the war and went into financial ruin, but Miami remained relatively unaffected. Over five hundred thousand enlisted men and fifty thousand officers trained in South Florida.<ref>[http://www.historical-museum.org/history/southfla.htm  Quick history of South Florida] retrieved January 28, 2006</ref> After the end of the war, many servicemen and women returned to Miami, pushing the population up to almost a quarter million by 1950.

Following the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 revolution]] that unseated [[Fulgencio Batista]] and brought [[Fidel Castro]] to power, most Cubans who were living in Miami went back to [[Cuba]]. That soon changed, and many middle class and upper class Cubans moved to Florida en masse with little possessions after Castro began to curtail legal rights. Miami generally welcomed the Cuban exiles.<ref>Parks, p 153-155</ref> In 1965 alone, 100,000 Cubans packed into the twice-daily "freedom flights" from [[Havana, Cuba]] to Miami. By the end of the 1960s, more than four hundred thousand Cuban refugees were living in [[Miami-Dade County]]. 

Although Miami was not really considered a major center of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, it did not escape the change that occurred.  Miami was a major city in the southern state of Florida, and had always had a substantial [[African-American]] and [[Caribbean]] population.  

In December 1979, police officers pursued motorcyclist [[Arthur McDuffie]] in a high-speed chase after McDuffie made a provocative gesture towards a police officer. The officers claimed that the chase ended when McDuffie crashed his [[motorcycle]] and died. The coroner's report concluded otherwise. One of the officers testified that McDuffie fell off of his bike on an [[Interstate 95]] on-ramp. When the police reached him he was injured but okay. The officers proceeded to remove his helmet, beat him to death with their batons, put his helmet back on, and called an ambulance claiming there had been a motorcycle accident. An all-white jury acquitted the officers after a brief deliberation. After learning of the verdict of the McDuffie case, one of the worst riots in the history of the United States, the infamous [[Liberty City Riots]], broke out. By the time the rioting ceased three days later, over 850 people had been arrested, and at least eight white people and ten African Americans had died in the riots. Property damage was estimated around one hundred million dollars.<ref>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/4069371.htm "Reliving the nightmare of the McDuffie riots"] ''Miami Herald, dtd September 15, 2002, retrieved January 28, 2006</ref>
 
[[Image:Mariel_Refugees.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel Boatlift crisis.]]
Later, the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980 brought 150,000 Cubans to Miami, the largest in civilian history. Unlike the previous exodus of the 1960s, most of the Cuban refugees arriving were poor. Castro used the boatlift as a way of purging his country of criminals and of the mentally ill. During this time, many of the middle class non-Hispanic whites in the community left the city, often referred to as "[[white flight]]." By 1990 Miami was less than 12% non-Hispanic white.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_DP1&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-_lang=en&-geo_id=16000US1245000  "DP-1. Profile of General Demographic Characteristics:  2000" for Miami, Florida.] [[United States Census Bureau]], 2000. Retrieved July 13, 2006.</ref>

In the 1980s, Miami started to see an increase in immigrants from other nations such as Haiti.  As the Haitian population grew, the area known today as [[Little Haiti]] emerged, centered around Northeast Second Avenue and 54th Street. In the 1990s, the presence of Haitians was acknowledged with [[Haitian Creole language]] signs in public places and ballots during voting.  

Another major Cuban exodus occurred in 1994. To prevent it from becoming another Mariel Boatlift, the Clinton Administration announced a significant change in U.S. policy. In a controversial action, the administration announced that Cubans interdicted at sea would not be brought to the United States but instead would be taken by the Coast Guard to U.S. military installations at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] or to Panama. During an eight-month period beginning in the summer of 1994, over 30,000 Cubans and more than 20,000 Haitians were interdicted and sent to live in camps outside the United States.

The [[Eli<U+00E1>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez]] uproar was a heated custody and immigration battle in the Miami area in 2000. The contoversy concerned six-year-old Eli<U+00E1>n Gonz<U+00E1>lez, who was rescued from the waters off the coast of Miami. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] and the [[Government of Cuba|Cuban governments]], his father Juan Miguel Gonz<U+00E1>lez, his Miami relatives, and the Cuban-American community of Miami were involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000 seizure of Eli<U+00E1>n by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community.

The controversial [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] negotiations occurred in 2003. It was a proposed agreement to reduce trade barriers while increasing intellectual property rights. During the 2003 meeting in Miami, the Free Trade Area of the Americas was met by heavy opposition from anti-corporatization and anti-globalization protests.

On July 27, 2005, the popular ex-city commissioner [[Arthur Teele]] walked into the main lobby of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' headquarters, dropped off a package for columnist [[Jim DeFede]], and told the security guard to tell his wife Stephanie he "loved her" before pulling out a gun and committing [[suicide]].<ref>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/12261057.htm "With suicide, Teele tried to take control"] ''Miami Herald'', dtd July 30, 2005, retrieved January 28, 2006</ref>

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===

The City of Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the [[Florida Everglades]] and [[Biscayne Bay]] that also extends from [[Florida Bay]] north to [[Lake Okeechobee]]. The elevation of the area never rises above 15ft (4.5 m) and averages at around 3ft (0.91 m) above sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created [[barrier island]]s, the largest of which contains the city of [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] and its famous [[South Beach]] district. The [[Gulf Stream]], a warm [[ocean current]], runs northward just 15 miles (24.1 km) off the coast, allowing the city's climate to stay warm and mild all year.

The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called ''Miami [[oolite]]'' or ''Miami [[limestone]]''. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 15 m (50 feet) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent [[glaciation]]s or ''[[ice age]]s''. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the [[Eemian interglacial|Sangamon interglacial]] raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (7.5 m.) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida [[plateau]], stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the [[Dry Tortugas]]. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of [[oolite]]s and the shells of [[bryozoans]]. Starting about 100,000 years ago the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the [[mainland]] of South Florida just above sea level.

Beneath the plain lies the [[Aquifer|Biscayne Aquifer]]<ref>[http://capp.water.usgs.gov/gwa/ch_g/G-text4.html USGS GROUND WATER ATLAS of the UNITED STATES], retrieved [[February 19]] [[2006]]</ref>, a natural underground river that extends from southern [[Palm Beach County]] to [[Florida Bay]], with its highest point peaking around the cities of [[Miami Springs, Florida|Miami Springs]] and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]]. Most of the [[South Florida metropolitan area]] obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20ft (4.57 to 6.1 m) beneath the city without hitting water, impeding underground construction.

Most of the western fringes of the city extend into the Everglades, a [[subtropical]] [[marshland]] located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of [[Florida]]. This causes occasional problems with local wildlife such as [[American Alligator|alligators]] and [[American Crocodile|crocodiles]] venturing onto suburban communities and major highways.

In terms of land area, the city of Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States.  According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the city encompasses a total area of 55.27 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]] (143.15 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]).  Of that area, 35.67 sq. miles (92.68 km<U+00B2>) are land and 19.59 sq. miles (50.73 km<U+00B2>) are water.  Miami is slightly smaller in land area than San Francisco and Boston.

The city is located at {{coor dms|25|47|16|N|80|13|27|W|}}{{GR|1}}.

===Climate===
[[Image:Downtown Miami from Key Biscayne.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Portion of the Miami skyline as seen from [[Key Biscayne]]]]

Miami has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with warm, humid summers, and mild winters by most standards. The city does experience cold fronts from November through March, however most of the year is warm and humid, and the summers are reminiscent of a true tropical climate. In addition, the city sees most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is mainly dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to September, when it gives way to the dry season, which features mild temperatures with some invasions of colder air, which is when the little winter rainfall occurs &mdash; with the passing of a front. The [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] largely coincides with the wet season. 

[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/activities/03/popup/climate.html Climate Zones of the World, under Koppen's System], retrieved [[August 8]], [[2006]]
In addition to its sea-level [[elevation]], coastal location and position just above the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the area owes its warm, humid climate to the [[Gulf Stream]], which moderates climate year-round. A typical summer day does not see temperatures below 75 <U+00BA>F (24 <U+00BA>C). Temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s (30-35 <U+00B0>C) accompanied by high humidity are often relieved by afternoon [[thunderstorms]] or a [[sea breeze]] that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, although conditions still remain very muggy.  During winter, humidity is significantly lower, allowing for cooler weather to develop.  Average minimum temperatures during that time are around 59 <U+00BA>F (15 <U+00BA>C), rarely dipping below 40 <U+00BA>F (4 <U+00BA>C), and the equivalent maxima usually range between 65 and 75 <U+00B0>F (18-24 <U+00B0>C). 

Officially, Miami has only once recorded a triple-digit [[temperature]], the all-time maximum being 100 <U+00BA>F (37.8 <U+00BA>C), set on [[July 21]], [[1942]]. However, extreme summer humidity often boosts the [[heat index]] to around 110 <U+00BA>F (43 <U+00B0>C). The coldest [[temperature]] ever recorded in the city of Miami was 28 <U+00B0>F (-2 <U+00B0>C) on [[January 27]], [[1940]]. Miami has only once recorded [[snowfall]], on January 20, 1977.  Weather conditions for the area around Miami were recorded sporadically from 1839 until 1900, with many years-long gaps. A cooperative temperature and rainfall recording site was established in what is now downtown Miami in December, 1900. An official [[National Weather Service|Weather Bureau Office]] was opened in Miami in June, 1911.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mfl/history/ History of National Weather Service Forecast Office - Miami, Florida] - URL retrieved [[August 19]], [[2006]]</ref>

Miami receives abundant rainfall, one of the highest among major U.S. cities. Most of this rainfall occurs from mid-May through early October. It receives annual rainfall of 58.6 inches (1488 mm) [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mfl/localdata.php], whereas nearby [[Fort Lauderdale]] and Miami Beach receive 63.8 in (1621 mm) and 48.3 in (1227 mm), respectively, which demonstrates the high local variability in rainfall rates. [[Hurricane season]] officially runs from [[June 1]] through [[November 30]], although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the [[Cape Verde-type hurricane|Cape Verde]] season which is mid August through the end of September<ref>[http://www.weather.com/newscenter/specialreports/hurricanes/vulnerablecities/miami.html Weather.com Vulnerable cities: Miami, Florida], retrieved [[February 19]] [[2006]]</ref>. Due to its location between two major bodies of water known for tropical activity, Miami is also statistically the most likely major city in the world to be struck by a hurricane, trailed closely by [[Nassau, Bahamas]], and [[Havana, Cuba]]. Despite this, the city has been fortunate in not having a direct hit by a hurricane since [[Hurricane Cleo]] in 1964.<ref>[http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/miami.htm Miami,Florida's history with tropical systems.] Hurricane City web site, retrieved [[February 19]] [[2006]]</ref> However, many other hurricanes have affected the city, including [[Hurricane Betsy|Betsy]] in 1965, [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] in 1992, [[Hurricane Irene (1999)|Irene]] in 1999, and Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2005. In addition, a tropical depression in October of 2000 passed over the city, causing record rainfall and flooding. Locally, the storm is credited as the [[Tropical Storm Leslie (2000)|No Name Storm of 2000]], though the depression went on to become Tropical Storm Leslie upon entering the Atlantic Ocean.

==Economy==
[[Image:Miamimanhattanization.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ever-increasing Miami skyline during its most recent construction boom. - October 2006<br>Photo: Marc Averette]]
Miami is one of the country's most important financial centers. It is the major center of regional commerce, and boasts a strong international business community.  According to the ranking of world cities undertaken by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group & Network (GaWC) and based on the level of presence of global corporate service organisations, Miami is considered a "Gamma [[World City]]."

Because of its proximity to Latin America, Miami serves as the headquarters of Latin American operations for many multinational corporations, including [[American Airlines]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Exxon]], [[FedEx]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[SBC Communications]] and [[Sony]].  Several large companies are headquartered in or around Miami, including [[Alienware]], [[AutoNation]], [[Burger King]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Citrix Systems]], [[DHL]], [[Norwegian Cruise Lines]], and [[Ryder|Ryder Systems]]. [[Miami International Airport]] and the [[Port of Miami]] are among the nation's busiest ports of entry, especially for cargo from South America and the Caribbean. Additionally, downtown Miami has the largest concentration of international banks in the country. Miami was also the host city of the 2003 [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] negotiations, and is one of the leading candidates to become the trading bloc's headquarters. This effort has been guided by [http://www.floridaftaa.org Florida FTAA].

Tourism is also an important industry: the beaches of Greater Miami draw visitors from across the country and around the world, and the [[Art Deco]] nightclub district in [[South Beach]] (in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]) is widely regarded as one of the most glamourous in the world.  However, it is important to note that Miami Beach is not a part of the city of Miami.  Even major TV networks sometimes forget this, as when [[Good Morning America]] visited Miami Beach and [[Charles Gibson]] thanked the mayor of Miami (but he was standing next to the mayor of Miami Beach).

In addition to these roles, Miami is also an industrial center, especially for stone quarrying and warehousing. 

Miami has also served as host venue for legendary legal proceedings, most notably the astounding $145 Billion verdict leveled against the nation's 5 largest cigarette manufacturers. This case was a class action on behalf of all afflicted Florida smokers and their families, represented by a prominent and successful Miami-raised husband and wife legal team, Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau 2002 American Community Survey, Miami was the poorest city in the United States, with 31% of the residents having incomes below the federal [[poverty]] line.  In 2004, Miami moved to third in the rankings ahead of [[Detroit, Michigan]] and [[El Paso, Texas]].

Miami is also one of the least affordable places to live, with 69% of its residents spending at least 30% of their household income on home ownership. Miami ranks first among least affordable cities for home ownership.

[[As of 2005]], the Miami area is witnessing its largest [[real estate]] boom [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|since the 1920s]].  The newly created [[Midtown Miami]], having well over a hundred approved construction projects is an example of this.<ref>http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=101321&bt=2&ht=3&sro=1</ref>

==Transportation==
{{further|[[Miami-Dade Transit]]}}
[[Image:MiamiMetroBus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Miami-Dade County Transit Buses in [[Miami Beach, Florida]].]]
Miami's main international hub is [[Miami International Airport]], which is one of the busiest international airports in the world, serving over 35 million passengers every year. Identified as MIA or KMIA by various world aviation authorities, it is a major hub and the single largest international gateway for [[American Airlines]], the world's largest passenger air carrier; and is also served by many foreign airlines.   MIA is the USA's third largest international port of entry for foreign air passengers (behind New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]] and Los Angeles' [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]]), and the seventh largest such gateway in the world (bested only by those two airports; combined with London's Heathrow, Paris' Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam's Schiphol, and Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok international airports). The airport's extensive international route network includes non-stop flights to over seventy international cities in North and South America, Europe, and the Middle East. [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]] (FLL/KFLL) also serves the metropolitan area, and actually handles more total passengers who are originating or ending their trip in south Florida than does MIA.

The main seaport, The [[Port of Miami]], is the largest cruise ship port in the world, serving over 18 million passengers per year.  Additionally, the port is one of the nation's busiest cargo ports, importing nearly ten million tons of cargo annually.  Among North American ports, it ranks second only to the [[Port of South Louisiana]] in terms of cargo tonnage imported/exported from Latin America.<ref>[http://www.co.miami-dade.fl.us/portofmiami/cruise.asp Port of Miami Official Site]</ref>

Miami is connected to [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] Atlantic Coast services.

Local public transportation includes [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrobus|Metrobus]] and [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrorail|Metrorail]], a [[metro]] [[rapid transit]] system (both operated by [[Miami-Dade Transit]]). Furthermore, [[Tri-Rail]], a [[commuter rail]] system, connects the major cities and airports of the [[South Florida metropolitan area]].  Several transit expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County.
A new light rail system is proposed and is called BayLink. BayLink will connect [[Downtown Miami]] with South beach.
Miami-Dade County is served by four Interstate Highways ([[Interstate 75|I-75]], [[Interstate 95|I-95]], [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|I-195]], [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|I-395]]) and several U.S. Highways including [[U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 27]], [[U.S. Route 41]], and [[U.S. Route 441]].  Some of the major [[Florida State Roads]] (and their common names) serving the county are:
* [[State Road 112 (Florida)|SR 112]] (Airport Expressway) Downtown to [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]
* [[State Road 821 (Florida)|SR 821]] (The [[HEFT]] or Homestead Extension of the [[Florida Turnpike]]: [[State Road 91 (Florida)|SR 91]]/[[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]] to [[U.S. Route 1]]/[[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]])
* [[State Road 826 (Florida)|SR 826]] (Palmetto Expressway) [[Golden Glades Interchange]] to U.S. Route 1/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]]

{{seealso|Movies made in Miami}}
There are many television shows that have been based in Miami. The controversial [[Emmy]] winning drama ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' and [[CBS]]'s ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' both take place in Miami. ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' was taped in Miami Beach from 1964 to 1970. The NBC show ''[[Good Morning, Miami]]'' was fictionally based around the workings of a Miami television station. The popular sitcom ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and the detective series ''[[Surfside 6]]'' were also based in Miami Beach. In the 1980's, no show rivaled ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in revitalizing the city's image as the 'mecca of cool' for the [[MTV Generation]]. Keeping with its modern music tradition, the city has recently hosted the 2004 and 2005 ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]''. The [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] reality shows ''[[Miami Ink]]'' and ''[[Million Dollar Agents]]'' are set in the city. Some other recent reality shows in Miami include [[Animal Planet]]'s ''[[Miami Animal Police]]'' and [[MTV]]'s ''[[8th & Ocean]]'' and ''[[The Real World: Miami]]''.

The video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' takes place in a [[Vice City|fictional city]] inspired by Miami, including some of the same architecture and geography. There were also people and gangsters in the game who speak [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

Miami is a center for Latin television and film production. As a result, many Spanish-language programs are filmed in the many television production studios, predominantly in [[Hialeah]] and [[Doral]]. This includes gameshows, variety shows, news programs, and [[telenovelas]] like ''Morelia'', ''La Mujer de Mi Vida'' etc. Arguably, the most famous being ''[[S<U+00E1>bado Gigante]]'', a Saturday night variety show seen throughout the United States, South America and Europe, and the daytime talk shows ''[[Cristina (television show)|Cristina]]'' and ''[[El Gordo y la Flaca]]''.

Miami has acted as the backdrop for several movies, including  ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'',  ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]] & [[Bad Boys II]]'', ''[[The Birdcage]]'', ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'' (based on the 80's television series of the same name),  and most notably 1983's ''[[Scarface]]''.

==Music==
{{unreferenced|date=November 2006}}
Miami music is varied. [[Latin American]] [[Immigrants]] brought the [[conga]] and [[rumba]] to Miami from their homelands instantly popularizing it in [[American culture]]. 

In the early-1970s, the Miami [[disco]] sound came to life with [[TK Records]], featuring the music of [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], with such hits as "Get Down Tonight", "(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" and "That's the Way (I Like It)"; and the Latin-American disco group, [[Foxy (band)]], with their hit singles "Get Off" and "Hot Number". Miami-area natives [[George McCrae]] and [[Teri DeSario]] were also popular music artists during the 1970s disco era.

Miami-influenced, [[Gloria Estefan]] and the [[Miami Sound Machine]], hit the popular music scene with their Cuban-oriented sound and had huge hits in the 1980s with "Conga" and "Bad Boys". 

Miami also had a huge place in hip-hop music since the mid-1980s, with its urban sound, rivaling that of [[New York City]] as the [[East Coast]]'s prime [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] mecca. Miami's also the birthplace of [[Miami Bass]] and arguably the birthplace of [[Southern Rap]]. Notable hip-hop artists from Miami consist of [[2 Live Crew]], [[Dre (producer)|Dre]], [[Luther Campbell]], [[Poison Clan]], [[Trick Daddy]], [[Trina]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[Smitty]], and the late [[DJ Uncle Al]]. Producers include [[Cool & Dre]], The [[Diaz Brothers]], [[Red Spyda]].

Latin Megastar [[Shakira]] did five concerts, from her US leg of the [[Oral Fixation Tour]], in Miami's [[American Airlines Arena]] in 2006. December 6th was even declared "Shakira Day" by the mayor and she was given the key to the city.

Miami is also considered a "hot spot" for [[Freestyle music|Freestyle]], a style of dance music popular in the 80's and 90's heavily influenced by [[Electro (music)|Electro]], hip-hop, and disco.  Many popular Freestyle acts such as [[Pretty Tony]], Debbie Deb, [[Stevie B]], [[Expos<U+00E9> (band)|Expos<U+00E9>]], and [[Paris By Air]] originated in Miami.

Beginning in the late 1990's, there has been a slight upsurge of a genre of music known as [[reggaeton]], originating from mainly Puerto Rican and Dominican influences. Artists such as Daddy Yankee, Wisin y Yandel, Gina, and others, typify the genre, which has gained mainstream popularity in part due to the dedication of a new Radio Station, "Mega 94.9", to reggaeton.
