==History==

Before 1935, SR&nbsp;111 was known as SR&nbsp;133.  When [[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|U.S. Route 33]] (US&nbsp;33) commissioned in Indiana, SR&nbsp;33 was decommissioned.  SR&nbsp;133 followed the same route as SR&nbsp;111.<ref name="illi-indi">[http://highwayexplorer.com/EndsPage.php?id=1111&section=1 Indiana Highway Ends: State Road 111]</ref><ref>[http://highwayexplorer.com/EndsPage.php?id=1133&section=1 Indiana Highway Ends: State Road 133]</ref> In October 2012, the portion of SR 111 in Clark County was turned over to the county, with the Floyd County portion turned over to the county in January 2013.<ref name="Clark County takes old SR">{{cite news|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/19595650/clark-county-takes-over-former-state-highways|title=Clark County Takes Over Former State Roads |accessdate=January 24, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DuXbITFP|archivedate=January 29, 2012| author=Chris McGill}}</ref><ref name="Floyd County takes over SR 111">{{cite news|title=Floyd County Takes Over Two State Roads |url=http://www.whas.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=283307&article=10738826#.UQcD7kY29JY.facebook |publisher= [[WHAS (AM)|WHAS]] |location = Louisville, KY |date= January 28, 2013 |accessdate= January 28, 2013}}</ref>
