'''Lemmons''', previously known as '''Gladsmuir House''' and currently as '''Gladsmuir''', was the name given by the writer [[Kingsley Amis]] (1922<U+2013>1995) and his second wife, novelist [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] (1923<U+2013>2014), to their home on [[Monken Hadley Common|Hadley Common]], [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], on the border of [[north London]] and [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=Keulks2003p135>Gavin Keulks, ''Father and Son: Kingsley Amis, Martin Amis, and the British Novel Since 1950'', University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, p. 135.</ref> 

The couple bought the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian house]] and its three-acre garden in 1968 for <U+00A3>48,000 at auction, and lived there until 1976. The house, which dates to 1830, had been registered as a Grade II [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]] in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir House. Howard restored the house's previous name, Lemmons, although the next owners changed it again to Gladsmuir.<ref>Zachary Leader, ''The Life of Kingsley Amis'', Jonathan Cape, 2006, pp. 607, 617.
*For its previous name, see Keulks 2003, p. 135, and Leader 2006, p. 626.
*For the next owners changing it to Gladsmuir, see Ian Norrie, ''Barnet in old photographs'', A. Sutton, 1993, p. 113.</ref>

Amis and Howard lived at Lemmons with a variety of house guests and family members, including Philip Amis, [[Martin Amis]] and [[Sally Amis]], Amis's children. In 1972 the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] (1904<U+2013>1972), his wife, [[Jill Balcon]] (1925<U+2013>2009), and their children, [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Tamasin Day-Lewis]], stayed there when Cecil was dying of cancer.<ref name=Sansom>Ian Sansom, [http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/03/great-dynasties-day-lewis-amis "Great dynasties of the world: The Day-Lewises"], ''The Guardian'', 3 April 2010.</ref> He died in the house on 22 May 1972; his poem, ''At Lemmons'', is about the last weeks of his life there.<ref name=poem/> [[Ian Sansom]] writes that, for the brief period that the Amises, Day-Lewises and others were in residence, Lemmons became "the most brilliantly creative household in Britain."<ref name=Sansom/>

==Architecture==
Red-brick with a [[stucco]] trim, the house has [[Bay (architecture)|five-bays]], two-storeys, a central [[Doric order|Doric]] porch with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] columns, and [[entablature]] with [[triglyph]]s. There are [[sash window]]s, two staircases, a later extension and a detached housekeeper's cottage, Gladsmuir Cottage.<ref name=listed>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1359075 "Gladsmuir"], English Heritage: "Circa 1830 Villa.

The land and an earlier house were owned by Henry Bellamy in 1584. The Quilter family owned it from 1736 to 1909, and built the current house around 1830.<ref name=listed/>

Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Howard lived there from 1968 to 1976, for part of the time with Howard's brother Colin, and her mother, Katherine ("Kit"). The artists Sargy Mann and Terry Raybauld lived there too, as did Amis's children, Philip, Martin and Sally, when not at school, and the housekeeper Mrs. Uniacke.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/03/great-dynasties-day-lewis-amis Sansom (''Guardian'')], 3 April 2010; Leader 2006, pp. 630, 668.</ref> 

Kingsley Amis wrote several novels at Lemmons <U+2013> ''[[The Green Man]]'' (1969), ''Girl, 20'' (1971), ''The Riverside Villas Murder'' (1973) and ''Ending Up'' (1974) <U+2013> while Howard wrote ''Something in Disguise'' (1969), and Martin Amis wrote ''[[Dead Babies (novel)|Dead Babies]]'' (1975).<ref>Leader 2006, p. 633; Keulks 2003, p. 136; Amis 2000, pp. 184, 349.</ref>

House guests included the poet [[Philip Larkin]] (1922<U+2013>1985), writers [[Tina Brown]] and [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], the literary agent [[Pat Kavanagh]] (1940<U+2013>2008) and the psychiatrist James Durham, Kavanagh's partner at the time.<ref>Leader 2006, pp. 616, 631.</ref> Howard's mother died there in March 1972.<ref name=Keulks2003p135/> Later that spring, when he was dying of cancer, the poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis stayed at Lemmons for five weeks, along with his wife, Jill Balcon, and their children, Daniel and Tamasin.<ref name=Sansom/> He wrote a poem about the house, ''At Lemmons'', shortly before his death there in May 1972.<ref name=poem>Cecil-Day Lewis, ''The Complete Poems'', Stanford University Press, 1992; see [http://www.cday-lewis.co.uk/#/at-lemmons/4525577835 "At Lemmons"], www.cday-lewis.co.uk.
*Leader 2006, pp. 630<U+2013>631.</ref>

The house was featured in June 1976 in an advertisement in ''[[Woman's Journal]]'' for wallpaper by [[Arthur Sanderson & Sons]]; Gavin Keulks reports that the ad read: "Very Sanderson, Very Amis."<ref>Keulks 2003, p. 284, note 6, citing Ian Woodward, "A Lovely Couple," ''Woman's Journal'', June 1976, pp. 19<U+2013>21.</ref> Amis and Howard sold the house shortly after this, moving to Gardnor House in Flask Walk, [[Hampstead]], London NW3; Amis was apparently tired of living so far from central London.<ref>Leader 2006, p. 667.</ref> As of 2014 the Hadley Trust, a grant-making charity, is registered at the house.<ref>[http://www.charityperformance.com/charity-details.php?id=13974 The Hadley Trust], Charity Performance, DG Publishing.</ref>
