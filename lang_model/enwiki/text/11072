[[Image:United Nations Members.PNG|thumb|350px|A map of [[United Nations|UN]] member [[state]]s and their [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] as recognized by the UN. Regions excluded: [[Antarctica]] (regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]), [[Vatican City]] (the [[Holy See]] is a [[United Nations General Assembly observers|UN observer]]), the [[Palestinian territories]] (Palestine, represented by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], is a UN observer), and [[Western Sahara]] (status in dispute between [[Morocco]] and the [[Polisario Front]]). The UN considers [[Taiwan]] administered by the [[Republic of China]] as "[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan, Province of China]]" and also considers the [[People's Republic of China]] as [[#Seat of China|the only legitimate representative]] of [[China]].]]
[[As of 2007]], there are 192 '''[[United Nations]] (UN) member states'''. Each member state is a member of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

According to the [[United Nations Charter]], Chapter 2, Article 4, the admission of any [[state]] to membership in the UN "will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter2.htm|title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter 2|publisher=United Nations}}</ref> In principle, only [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states can become UN members, and today all UN members are fully sovereign states. However, four of the original members ([[Belarus]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Ukraine]]) were not independent at the time of their admission. Moreover, because a state can only be admitted by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly, some entities which may be considered [[List of sovereign states|sovereign states]] according to the [[Montevideo Convention]] are not members due to the fact that the UN do not consider them to be sovereign states, the lack of international recognition or opposition from certain members.

[[International organization]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s, and entities whose statehood or sovereignty are not precisely defined, can only become [[United Nations General Assembly observers]], allowing them to speak, but not vote, in General Assembly meetings.

==Current members==
[[Image:United Nations member countries world map.PNG|thumb|350px|UN member states displayed by the decade in which they [[Enlargement of the United Nations|joined the UN]].]]

The members are listed below by alphabetical order in their short-form English names, with their respective dates of admission. There were 51 original members of the UN which were admitted in 1945, of which 49 are either still in the organization or had their seats taken by a [[successor state]] (e.g., the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s seat was succeeded by [[Russia]]). The other two original members were [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], as both had dissolved and their seats were not succeeded by any state (see ''[[#Czechoslovakia|Former members: Czechoslovakia]]'' and ''[[#Yugoslavia|Former members: Yugoslavia]]'' respectively). For [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the UN]], the [[Republic of China]] was replaced by the [[People's Republic of China]] on [[25 October]] [[1971]], even though the governments of both have existed well before and after this date (see ''[[#Seat of China|Seat of China]]'').

==Former members==
===Czechoslovakia===
{{flagicon|Czechoslovakia}} '''[[Czechoslovakia]]''' joined the UN as an original member on [[24 October]] [[1945]]. On [[10 December]] [[1992]], Czechoslovakia informed the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] that it would cease to exist after [[31 December]] [[1992]], and that both its successor states, the {{flagicon|Czech Republic}} ''[[Czech Republic]]'' and {{flagicon|Slovakia}} ''[[Slovakia]]'', would apply for UN membership. They were admitted on [[19 January]] [[1993]].

===East Germany and West Germany===
Both the {{flagicon|East Germany}} '''German Democratic Republic''' (i.e., [[East Germany]]) and the {{flagicon|West Germany}} '''Federal Republic of Germany''' (i.e., [[West Germany]]) were admitted on [[18 September]] [[1973]]. {{flagicon|Germany}} ''[[Germany]]'' was reunified when the German Democratic Republic acceeded to the Federal Republic of Germany on [[3 October]] [[1990]].

===Tanganyika and Zanzibar===
{{flagicon|Tanganyika}} '''[[Tanganyika]]''' was admitted on [[14 December]] [[1961]], and {{flagicon|Zanzibar|Sultanate}} '''[[Zanzibar]]''' was admitted on [[16 December]] [[1963]]. {{flagicon|Tanzania}} ''[[Tanzania]]'' was formed when the two countries merged to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar on [[26 April]] [[1964]], which later changed its name to the United Republic of Tanzania on [[1 November]] [[1964]].

===United Arab Republic===
Both {{flagicon|Egypt}} ''[[Egypt]]'' and {{flagicon|Syria}} ''[[Syria]]'' joined the UN as original members on [[24 October]] [[1945]]. The {{flagicon|United Arab Republic}} '''[[United Arab Republic]]''' was formed by an union of the two countries following a plebiscite on [[21 February]] [[1958]], and continued as a single member in the UN until [[13 October]] [[1961]], when Syria, having resumed its status as an independent state, resumed its separate membership in the UN. Egypt continued as a UN member under the name United Arab Republic until [[2 September]] [[1971]], when it changed its name to the Arab Republic of Egypt.

===USSR===
The {{flagicon|Soviet Union}} '''[[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]''' (USSR) was one of the five original founders of the UN in 1945 and joined the UN as an original member on [[24 October]] [[1945]]. On [[24 December]] [[1991]], upon the imminent dissolution of the USSR, [[Boris Yeltsin]], the [[President of Russia]], informed the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] that the membership of the USSR in the UN (including its permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]) was being continued by {{flagicon|Russia}} ''[[Russia]]'' with the support of the 11 member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

The remaining former Soviet Republics are currently all UN members:
*{{flagicon|Belarus}} ''[[Belarus]]'' and {{flagicon|Ukraine}} ''[[Ukraine]]'' had already joined the UN as original members on [[24 October]] [[1945]], represented by the [[Byelorussian SSR]] and the [[Ukrainian SSR]] respectively until their independence in 1991.
*{{flagicon|Estonia}} ''[[Estonia]]'', {{flagicon|Latvia}} ''[[Latvia]]'' and {{flagicon|Lithuania}} ''[[Lithuania]]'' were admitted on [[17 September]] [[1991]].
*{{flagicon|Armenia}} ''[[Armenia]]'', {{flagicon|Azerbaijan}} ''[[Azerbaijan]]'', {{flagicon|Kazakhstan}} ''[[Kazakhstan]]'', {{flagicon|Kyrgyzstan}} ''[[Kyrgyzstan]]'', {{flagicon|Moldova}} ''[[Moldova]]'', {{flagicon|Tajikistan}} ''[[Tajikistan]]'', {{flagicon|Turkmenistan}} ''[[Turkmenistan]]'', and {{flagicon|Uzbekistan}} ''[[Uzbekistan]]'' were admitted on [[2 March]] [[1992]].
*{{flagicon|Georgia}} ''[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'' was admitted on [[31 July]] [[1992]].

===North and South Yemen===
{{flagicon|North Yemen}} '''Yemen''' (i.e., [[North Yemen]]) was admitted on [[30 September]] [[1947]], first represented by the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]], then by the [[Yemen Arab Republic]]. {{flagicon|South Yemen}} '''Democratic Yemen''' (i.e., [[South Yemen]]) was originally admitted as "Southern Yemen" on [[14 December]] [[1967]], represented by the People's Republic of South Yemen, which later changed its name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. {{flagicon|Yemen}} ''[[Yemen]]'' was unified when the two countries merged to form the Republic of Yemen on [[22 May]] [[1990]].

===Yugoslavia===
{{flagicon|Yugoslavia}} '''[[Yugoslavia]]''' joined the UN as an original member on [[24 October]] [[1945]], represented by the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, which later changed its name to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had been dissolved by 1992, and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was formed on [[28 April]] [[1992]] by the former Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. By General Assembly resolution A/RES/47/1 on [[22 September]] [[1992]], the UN "considers that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations, and therefore decides that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly."

The former Yugoslav Republics are currently all UN members:
*{{flagicon|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} ''[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'', {{flagicon|Croatia}} ''[[Croatia]]'' and {{flagicon|Slovenia}} ''[[Slovenia]]'' were admitted on [[22 May]] [[1992]].
*{{flagicon|FYROM}} ''[[Republic of Macedonia|The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]]'' was admitted on [[8 April]] [[1993]], pending settlement of the [[Macedonia naming dispute|difference that had arisen over its name]].
*The [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was admitted on [[1 November]] [[2000]], replacing, instead of succeeding, the membership of Yugoslavia in the UN held by the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which officially remained a UN member until that day. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia changed its name to {{flagicon|Serbia and Montenegro}} ''[[Serbia and Montenegro]]'' on [[4 February]] [[2003]]. Since the declaration of independence by Montenegro on [[3 June]] [[2006]], the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the UN has been continued by {{flagicon|Serbia}} ''[[Serbia]]'' on the basis of Article 60 of the [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro]].
*{{flagicon|Montenegro}} ''[[Montenegro]]'' was admitted on [[28 June]] [[2006]].

==Seat of China==
{{main|China and the United Nations}}

'''[[China]]''', represented by the government of the {{flagicon|Republic of China}} '''[[Republic of China]]''' (ROC), was one of the five original founders of the UN in 1945 and joined the UN as an original member on [[24 October]] [[1945]]. However, as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled ROC government fled to [[Taiwan]] in 1949, with the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] government of the {{flagicon|People's Republic of China}} '''[[People's Republic of China]]''' (PRC), declared on [[1 October]] [[1949]], taking control of most of the territory of China. Representatives of the ROC government continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of Taiwan (and [[List of islands of the Republic of China|other islands]] not considered part of [[Taiwan Province]]) compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of [[mainland China]], until [[25 October]] [[1971]], when [[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|General Assembly resolution 2758]] was passed, recognising the PRC government as the only legitimate representative of China at the UN, and expelling the representatives of the [[Chiang Kai-shek]]-led ROC government from the UN. This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN (including its permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]) from the ROC to the PRC.

===Bids for membership by Taiwan===
Since 1991, the Republic of China has repeatedly petitioned to rejoin the UN, as the representative of the people of Taiwan only, instead of all of China, using the designation "Republic of China on Taiwan", "Republic of China (Taiwan)", or just "Taiwan" (as proposed by the current [[Democratic Progressive Party]] government). However, all attempts have been denied, either because the petition failed to get sufficient votes to get on the formal agenda, or because the application was rejected by the UN, due primarily to the opposition of the People's Republic of China. The ROC has also been denied participation in the UN as an "observer state", a position held by the [[Holy See]], or as a "non-member entity", a title currently granted to [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestine]] (see ''[[#Observers and non-members|Observers and non-members]]'').{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

In July 2007, the current [[Chen Shui-bian]]-led ROC government submitted the ROC's 15th application to join the UN, and its first under the name "Taiwan", but its application was rejected by the UN Office of Legal Affairs, citing General Assembly resolution 2758.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2007/db070723.doc.htm|title=Transcript: Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General|publisher=United Nations|date=[[23 July]] [[2007]]}}</ref> Responding to the application, [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-Moon]] stated that: {{quote|With the understanding of the Governor and the Chairman, I will briefly mention that membership into the UN ultimately needs to be decided by the Member States of the United Nations. Membership is given to a sovereign country. The position of the United Nations is that the People's Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China. The decision until now about the wish of the people in Taiwan to join the United Nations has been decided on that basis. The resolution (General Assembly resolution 2758) that you just mentioned is clearly mentioning that the Government of China is the sole and legitimate Government and the position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1053|title=San Jose, California, 27 July 2007 - Secretary-General's press encounter with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger|publisher=United Nations|date=[[27 July]] [[2007]]}}</ref>}}

Responding to the UN's rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan's participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation. The ROC government, as well as several international newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118696621693795613.html|title=King of the U.N.|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=[[13 August]] [[2007]]}}</ref> also criticized Ban for returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly, contrary to UN's standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm|title=Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council|publisher=United Nations}}</ref> and for asserting that Taiwan is part of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/viewstory.asp?Page=/ForeignBureaus/archive/200708/INT20070807a.html|title=UN Head Criticized for Saying Taiwan Is 'Part of China'|publisher=CNSNews.com|date=[[7 August]] [[2007]]}}</ref> On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China, praised that UN's decision "was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the [[One-China policy|one-China principle]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-07/24/content_6425429.htm|title=China praises UN's rejection of Taiwan's application for membership|publisher=Xinhua|date=[[24 July]] [[2007]]}}</ref> While the PRC government firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN or any of its agencies, such as the [[World Health Organization]], the ROC government continues to call on the international community to recognize the right of the island's 23 million citizens to participate in the meetings and activities of the UN and its affiliates. Currently, 23 UN member states and the Holy See maintain [[Foreign relations of the Republic of China#List of countries with diplomatic relations with the ROC|diplomatic relations with the ROC]].

==Observers and non-members==
{{main|United Nations General Assembly observers}}

In addition to the member states discussed above, there is one non-member observer state, the ''[[Holy See]]'' (which holds sovereignty over the state of [[Vatican City]]). It has been a permanent observer state since [[6 April]] [[1964]]. Non-member observer states are recognized as sovereign entities, and are free to submit a petition to join as a full member at their discretion. For example, [[Switzerland]] was also a permanent observer state from 1948 to 2002, until becoming a full member on [[10 September]] [[2002]].

The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) was granted observer status by General Assembly resolution 3237 on [[22 November]] [[1974]]. After the proclaimed declaration of the [[State of Palestine]] by the PLO, its designation in the UN was changed to ''Palestine'' by General Assembly resolution A/RES/43/177 on [[15 December]] [[1988]]. Palestine's status in the UN is "a non-member entity".

The sovereignty status of [[Western Sahara]] is in dispute between [[Morocco]] and the [[Polisario Front]]. Most of the territory is administered by Morocco, the remainder (the [[Free Zone (Western Sahara region)|Free Zone]]) by the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), proclaimed by the Polisario Front. The SADR is a full member of the [[African Union]], but is neither a member nor observer of the UN.

The [[associated state]]s of [[New Zealand]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], are not UN members. While self-governing in their domestic affairs, most of their foreign affairs are represented by New Zealand on their behalf. The Cook Islands and Niue are members of UN agencies such as [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNESCO]], and are signatories of international treaties such as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].

Many [[international organization]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s, and entities whose statehood or sovereignty are not precisely defined, such as the [[European Union]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], are invited to become observers at the General Assembly.
