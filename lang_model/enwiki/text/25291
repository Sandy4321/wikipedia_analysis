'''Peper Harow''' is a tiny village in south-west [[Surrey]] close to the town of [[Godalming]] which was a noted early [[cricket]] venue. 

==Location and history==
The whole village is privately owned and access is restricted. The name "Peper Harow" is very unusual and comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Pipers Hearg'' meaning, approximately "[[Paganism|Pagan]] [[Heathen hofs|Temple]]".

Peper Harrow appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Pipereherge''. It was held by Girard (Gerard) from Walter, son of Othere. Its domesday assets were: 3 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s. It had 3 [[plough]]s, 1 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] worth 15s, {{convert|7|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]]. It rendered <U+00A3>5.

In the graveyard of St. Nicholas's Church (dating to 1301) is an ancient [[Taxus baccata|yew]] tree which has been dated to at least 1,500 years old and is probably older still. It could stand on the site of the old pagan temple or it could even ''be'' the old pagan temple as trees were venerated in those times by the [[Saxons]]. Close to Peper Harrow at Bonville Hanger Wood is a [[Holy well]] called ''Bonfield Spring'' that is also thought to have held pre-Christian religious significance. 

St. Nicholas's church was almost destroyed by fire in December 2007 [http://www.peperharow.info/church.htm]. The yew was unharmed and the church is currently being restored.

==Cricket==
[[Cricket]] has long been played here, with evidence of rules and matches dating to 1727.<ref>Marshall, pp.45<U+2013>48.</ref>

In the 1720s, Peper Harow was the seat of [[Alan Brodrick, 1st Viscount Midleton]] who was succeeded by his son [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton]] in the viscountcy on 29 August 1728. Before succeeding,  the latter made his mark as a cricket patron by arranging major matches against his friend [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]]. Records have survived of two such games that took place in the [[1727 English cricket season|1727 season]].<ref>McCann, pp.6<U+2013>7.</ref> These two games are highly significant because Richmond and Brodrick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] beforehand to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. These were itemised in sixteen points.<ref>Birley, pp.18<U+2013>19.</ref> It is believed that this was the first time that rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. The first full codification of the [[Laws of Cricket]] was done in 1744.<ref>Birley, p.19.</ref>

==Other activities==
During the Second World War, Peper Harow was used as a holding area for Canadian Forces.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/04/a4542004.shtml People's War]</ref> The park is occasionally used for [[Point to point (steeplechase)|point-to-point horse racing]].<ref>{{Cite web |author=Bramley Historical Society |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=25 July 2005 |url=http://www.pointingse.webeden.co.uk/#/peperharow/4525940675 |title=Tanks give way to bicycles }}</ref>

== Peper Harow House ==
[[Image:peperharowhouse1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Peper Harow House]]
Peper Harow House was built by [[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]] in 1765.

[[Capability Brown|Sir Lancelot 'Capability' Brown]] landscaped the park in 1762-3, and many fine trees remain from this time. Particularly notable are the [[Lebanon Cedar]]. The house was owned by the [[Viscount Midleton|Midleton]] family until 1944 when it was sold to property developers. It, and the entire village, is now owned by a trust.
There is also an ancient bridge called Somerset Bridge which crosses the River Wey and connects Peper Harow with nearby [[Elstead]].

== The Peper Harow Residential Community ==
The Peper Harow residential community was founded in 1970 by Melvyn Rose and gained international repute for its pioneering work with disturbed adolescents. For over 20 years, this establishment provided a therapeutic environment for teenagers who had often suffered appalling abuse.

The Peper Harow therapeutic community was set up by Melvyn Rose who had been a house master at the approved school, Park House, that pre-dated the Peper Harow Community. Rose understood that the difficult and sometimes violent behaviour of the  young  residents at Peper Harow reflected their personal pain and distress. All young people were assigned a personal mentor who developed very close relationships with the children in their care. In keeping with the interest in eastern philosophy at the time these were, rather quaintly, known as "Gurus". The residents and staff together took responsibility for the daily maintenance of the community and all contributed to cooking and cleaning. The young people were considered to be partners in the therapeutic endeavour and there was an expectation that everyone attended the daily community meetings. These meetings were the heart of the community and often young people were able to share and resolve very painful experiences from their past, and the daily difficulties and challenges of sixty adults and children  living together could be addressed in a helpful way. There were high expectations on young people to help each other and to achieve educationally. Many young people left to go to university and others took up higher education at a later point in their adult lives. Unfortunately residential care for children fell out of favour as a result of abuse scandals and Peper Harow eventually closed. It still has an influence today. In particular Rose's understanding of the importance of the physical and sensory environment in healing traumatised young people was decades ahead of his time.
