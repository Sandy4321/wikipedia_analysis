{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
The '''Christian Social Party''' (in Dutch: ''Christelijk-Sociale Partij'', CSP) was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[political party]]. The CSP played only a minor role in Dutch politics and is historically linked to the [[PvdA|Labour Party]].

==Party History==
The CSP was founded in 1907 by former members of the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Dutch Reformed Church|reformed]] [[Christian Historical Union]]. In the [[Dutch general election, 1918|1918 elections]], the first election with a system of [[proportional representation]] and male [[universal suffrage]] the restriction to get into the Tweede Kamer were relatively low, one needed more than half of a percentage of the vote to be elected. Consequently the CSP was elected with only 8000 votes (that is .6% of vote). The CSP MP [[Adolf van der Laar|Van der Laar]] played only a minor role in Dutch politics. In the [[Dutch general elections, 1922|1922 elections]] the restrictions to enter parliament where highered. The CSP was unable to maintain its seat. In the [[Dutch general election, 1925|1925 elections]] the party campaigned as  the '''Protestant People's Party''' (Dutch: ''Protestant Volkspartij'', PVP). In 1926 the CSP founded the [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Union]] with former members of the [[Christian Democratic Party (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Party]] and the [[League of Christian Socialists]].

==Ideology & Issues==
CSP was both a [[social democracy|social-democratic]] and a conservative [[christianity|christian]] party. CSP was a [[reformist]] and rejected [[class conflict]]. The party was [[anti-papist]] and rejected the [[Christian democracy in the Netherlands|cooperation]] between the Protestant [[Christian Historical Union]] and the catholic [[General League]].

Its program combined conservative Protestant proposals with social democratic ones. Among the social-democratic proposals were [[nationalization]] of core industries, [[workers' councils]] in companies and workers shares in profit. Among the conservative proposals were the proposal to financially privilege the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] to main the Protestant identity of the Netherlands. An interesting proposal, for the 1910s, was to enact legislation against the [[pollution]] of soils, water and air.
