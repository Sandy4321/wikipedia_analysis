Between c. 140 and c. 116 BCE, the dynasty ruled semi-autonomously from the [[Seleucids]] in the region of [[Judea]]. From 110 BCE, with the [[Seleucid empire]] disintegrating, the dynasty became fully independent, expanded in to the neighbouring regions of [[Galilee]], [[Iturea]], [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]], [[Idumea]] and [[Samaria]], and took the title "[[basileus]]". Some modern scholars refer to this period as an independent kingdom of [[Land of Israel|Israel]].<ref>Leon James Wood, David O'Brien, ''A survey of Israel's history'', Zondervan, 1986</ref> In 63 BCE, the kingdom was conquered by the [[Roman Republic]], broken up and set up as a Roman [[client state]].

The dynasty was established under the leadership of [[Simon Maccabaeus]], two decades after his brother [[Judas Maccabeus|Judas the Maccabee]] ("Hammer") defeated the [[Seleucid]] army during the [[Maccabean Revolt]] in [[165 BCE]]. The Hasmonean Kingdom survived for 103 years before yielding to the [[Herodian Dynasty]] in 37 BCE. Even then, [[Herod the Great]] felt obliged to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, Mariamne, and conspiring to have the last male Hasmonean heir drowned in his [[Jericho]] palace.

According to historical sources including the books [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]] and the first book of ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]] ([[37]]&ndash;c.&nbsp;[[100]] CE),<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book|title=Flavius Josephus|author=Louis H. Feldman, Steve Mason|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=1999}}</ref> the Hasmonean Kingdom rose after a successful revolt by the Jews against the Seleucid king [[Antiochus IV]].  After Antiochus' successful invasion of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] was turned back by the intervention of the [[Roman Republic]]<ref>See [[Gaius Popillius Laenas]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt#The decline of the Ptolemies|The decline of the Ptolemies]],</ref> he moved instead to assert strict control over Israel, sacking [[Jerusalem]] and its [[First Temple|Temple]], suppressing Jewish religious and cultural observances, and [[Hellenization|imposing Hellenistic]] practices.

The ensuing [[Maccabees|Maccabee Revolt]] ([[167 BCE]]) began a twenty-five-year period of Jewish independence potentiated by the steady collapse of the Seleucid Empire under attacks from the rising powers of the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Parthian Empire]].  However, the same power vacuum that enabled the Jewish state to be recognized by the [[Roman Senate]] c.&nbsp;[[139 BCE]] was next exploited by the Romans themselves.  [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]], Simon's great-grandsons, became pawns in a [[proxy war]] between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey the Great]]. The deaths of Pompey ([[48 BCE]]), Caesar ([[44 BCE]]), and the related [[Liberators' civil war|Roman civil wars]] temporarily relaxed Rome's grip on Israel, allowing a very brief Hasmonean resurgence backed by the [[Parthian Empire]].  This short independence was rapidly crushed by the Romans under [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavian]]. The installation of [[Herod the Great]] (an Idumean) as king in 37 BCE made Israel a Roman [[client state]], ending the Hasmonean dynasty. In 6 CE, Rome joined [[Judea]] proper, [[Samaria]] and Idumea (biblical [[Edom]]) into the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Iudaea]]. In 44 CE, Rome installed the rule of a [[List of Kings of Judea#Roman Procurators|Roman procurator]] side by side with the rule of the Herodian kings (specifically [[Agrippa I]] 41<U+2013>44 and [[Agrippa II]] 50<U+2013>100).

== Background ==
[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|left|250px|At the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, the [[Seleucid]] Empire (in yellow) expanded into Israel at the expense of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] (blue).]]
The lands of the former [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]] (c.&nbsp;930 BCE&ndash;586 BCE), had been occupied in turn by [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]], the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and [[Alexander the Great]]'s Hellenic [[Macedon|Macedonian empire]] (c.&nbsp;330 BCE), although Jewish religious practice and culture had persisted and even flourished during certain periods.  The entire region was heavily contested between the successor states of Alexander's empire, the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], during the six [[Syrian Wars]] of the 3rd<U+2013>1st centuries BCE:  "After two centuries of peace under the Persians, the Hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires: the Seleucid state with its [[Antioch|capital in Syria]] to the north and the Ptolemaic state, with its [[Alexandria|capital in Egypt]] to the south...Between 319 and 302 BCE, Jerusalem changed hands seven times."<ref name=

Under [[Antiochus III]] the Seleucids wrested control of Israel from the Ptolemies for the final time, defeating [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] at the [[Battle of Panium]] in [[198 BCE]].  Seleucid rule over the Jewish parts of the region then resulted in the rise of Hellenistic cultural and religious practices:  "In addition to the turmoil of war, there arose in the Jewish nation pro-Seleucid and pro-Ptolemaic parties; and the schism exercised great influence upon the Judaism of the time. It was in [[Antioch]] that the Jews first made the acquaintance of Hellenism and of the more corrupt sides of Greek culture; and it was from Antioch that Palestine henceforth was ruled."<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis.  {{cite web|title=Antiochus III The Great|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1588&letter=A&search=Antiochus%20III|accessdate=2007-01-23}} ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.</ref>

==Historical sources==
[[File:Stattler-Machabeusze.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Wojciech Stattler]]'s ''Machabeusze'' (Maccabees), 1844]]
The origin of the Hasmonean dynasty is recorded in the books [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]], covering the period from 175 to 134 BCE during which time the Hasmonean dynasty became semi-independent from the [[Seleucid empire]] but had not yet expanded far outside of [[Judea]]. The books are considered part of the [[Biblical canon]] by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches and [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] by most Protestant Christians; but are not a part of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The books are written from the point of view that the salvation of the Jewish people in a crisis which came from God through the family of Mattathias, particularly his sons Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus, and Simon Thassi, and his grandson [[John Hyrcanus]]. The books include historical and religious material from the [[Septuagint]] that was codified by [[Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians.

The other primary source for the Hasmonean dynasty is the first book of ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], ([[37]]&ndash;shortly after [[100]] CE).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Josephus' account is the only primary source covering the history of the Hasmonean dynasty during the period of its expansion and independence between 110 to 63 BCE. Notably, Josephus, a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] and former general in the Galilee, who survived the [[Jewish<U+2013>Roman wars|Roman-Jewish wars]] of the 1st century CE, was a Jew who was captured and cooperated with the Romans; writing his books in Rome; leaving some to question his impartiality and credibility as a historian.<ref>Bentwich, Norman.  {{cite web|title=''Josephus''|url=http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1914_bentwich_josephus.html|accessdate=2007-01-18}}  Philadelphia:Jewish Publication Society of America, 1914:  "He was not a loyal general, and he was not a faithful chronicler of the struggle with Rome; but he had the merit of writing a number of books on the Jews and Judaism." Preface.</ref> 

The books of Maccabees use the names "Judea" and "Israel" (or cognates) as geographical descriptors throughout for both the land and people over whom the Hasmoneans would rule. The [[Talmud]] includes one of the Hasmonean kings under the description "Kings of Israel". Scholars refer to the state as the Hasmonean Kingdom to distinguish it from the previous kingdoms of Israel. The name "Judaea" has also been used to describe the Hasmonean Kingdom although this name reflects the later designation of the region under the Romans at the time of Josephus' writings in the late first century CE.

===Hellenization===

The Greek inscription reads <U+0392><U+0391><U+03A3><U+0399><U+039B><U+0395><U+03A9><U+03A3> <U+0391><U+039D><U+03A4><U+0399><U+039F><U+03A7><U+039F><U+03A5> <U+0398><U+0395><U+039F><U+03A5> <U+0395><U+03A0><U+0399><U+03A6><U+0391><U+039D><U+039F><U+03A5> <U+039D><U+0399><U+039A><U+0397><U+03A6><U+039F><U+03A1><U+039F><U+03A5> (King Antiochus, the holy Ephiphanus, Nikanor.]]
The [[Hellenization]] of the Jews in the pre-Hasmonean period was not universally resisted.  Generally, the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute, and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally. Nevertheless, Jews were divided between those favoring Hellenization and those opposing it, and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids.  When the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] Simon II died in [[175 BCE]], conflict broke out between supporters of his son [[Onias III]] (who opposed Hellenization, and favored the [[Ptolemies]]) and his son [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] (who favored Hellenization, and favored the Seleucids).  A period of political intrigue followed, with priests such as [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]] bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title. The result was a brief civil war. The [[Tobiads]], a philo-Hellenistic party, succeeded in placing Jason into the powerful position of High Priest.  He established an arena for public games close by the Temple.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. {{cite web|title=The Tobiads and Oniads.|accessdate=2007-01-23|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1589&letter=A}} ''Jewish Encyclopedia.</ref>  Author Lee I. Levine notes, "The 'piece de resistance' of Judaean Hellenization, and the most dramatic of all these developments, occurred in [[175 BCE]], when the high priest Jason converted Jerusalem into a Greek [[polis]] replete with [[gymnasium (Ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and ephebeion (2 Maccabees 4). Whether this step represents the culmination of a 150-year process of Hellenization within Jerusalem in general, or whether it was only the initiative of a small coterie of Jerusalem priests with no wider ramifications, has been debated for decades."<ref>Levine, Lee I.

===Antiochus IV against Jerusalem===
The Hellenistic trends in Jewish society were, however, inadequate protection against Antiochus.  In [[168 BCE]], after successfully invading the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt (apparently without Jewish support), [[Antiochus IV]] was pressured by the [[Roman Republic]] to withdraw.  According to [[Livy]], "Popilius...placed in [Antiochus'] hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate [to withdraw]...[and] drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, 'Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate.'"<ref>[[Livy]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy45.html xlv.12.]</ref>  Returning toward Antioch, the troops of Antiochus sacked Jerusalem and removed the sacred objects from the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]], slaughtering an unknown, but large, number of Jews:<blockquote>"And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel<br> and Jerusalem with a great multitude,<br>And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof...<br>And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.<br>Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were."(1 Maccabees&nbsp;1:20<U+2013>25)<ref>1 Maccabees 1:20<U+2013>25 (excerpts), via {{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/poly/ma1001.htm|title=Polyglot Bible.  1 Maccabees.|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref> </blockquote>
He then imposed a tax and established a [[Acra (fortress)|fortress]] in Jerusalem. Antiochus tried to suppress public observance of Jewish laws, apparently in an attempt to secure control over the Jews. His government set up an [[Idolatry|idol]] of [[Zeus]]<ref>http://virtualreligion.net/iho/antiochus_4.html</ref> on the [[Temple Mount]], which Jews considered to be desecration of the Mount; it also forbade both [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] and possession of Jewish scriptures, on pain of death.  According to Josephus,<blockquote>"Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking the city, or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made there; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering what he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve the laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised, and to sacrifice swine's flesh upon the altar."<ref name=Whiston>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout=&doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148&query=whiston%20chapter%3D%232&loc=1.1 William Whiston translation of ''The Wars of the Jews'']</ref></blockquote>  He also outlawed observance of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and the offering of sacrifices at the Jerusalem Temple and required Jewish leaders to sacrifice to idols; punitive executions were also instituted.  Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offence.  The motives of Antiochus are unclear.  He may have been incensed at the overthrow of his appointee, Menelaus,<ref name=Oesterley>Oesterley, W.O.E., ''A History of Israel'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1939</ref> he may have been responding to an orthodox Jewish revolt that had drawn on the Temple and the [[Torah]] for its strength, or he may have been encouraged by a group of radical Hellenizers among the Jews.<ref name=deLange>[[Nicholas de Lange]] (ed.), ''The Illustrated History of the Jewish People'', London, Aurum Press, 1997, ISBN  1 85410 530 2</ref>

===Maccabean Revolt===
{{main|Maccabean Revolt}}{{See also|Hanukkah}}<br>
{{Maccabee}}
The author of the [[First Book of Maccabees]] regarded the Maccabean revolt as a rising of pious Jews against the Seleucid king who had tried to eradicate their religion and against the Jews who supported  him.  The author of the [[Second Book of Maccabees]] presented the conflict as a struggle between "Judaism" and "Hellenism", words that he was the first to use.<ref name="deLange"/> Modern scholarship tends to the second view.

Most modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in a [[civil war]] between traditionalist Jews in the countryside and Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite book |title= Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know about the Jewish Religion, Its People, and Its History|last=Telushkin |first=Joseph  |year= 1991|publisher= W.

Feldman, Meyer Reinhold,  Fortress Press, 1996, p. 147</ref>

The two most prominent 20th century scholars of the Maccabean revolt, [[Elias Bickermann]] and [[Victor Tcherikover]], each have very different views for the cause of the revolt, focused on the policies of the Jewish leaders and not Antiochus IV: <blockquote>"Bickermann saw the origin of the problem in the attempt of "Hellenized" Jews to reform the "antiquated" and "outdated" religion practiced in Jerusalem, and to rid it of superstitious elements. They were the ones who egged on Antiochus IV and instituted the religious reform in Jerusalem. One suspects that [Bickermann] may have been influenced in his view by an antipathy to Reform Judaism in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany. Tcherikover, perhaps influenced by socialist concerns, saw the uprising as one of the rural peasants against the rich elite.<ref>Doran, Robert. {{cite web|title=The revolt of the Maccabees.|accessdate=2007-03-07|url=

[[File:Maccabean dynasty.PNG|right|400px|thumb|The descendants of Mattathias|right]]

According to I and II Maccabees, the priestly family of [[Mattathias]] (Mattisyahu/Mattitiyahu in Hebrew), which came to be known as the ''Maccabees''<ref>The name may be related to the [[Aramaic]] word for "hammer", or may be derived from an acronym of the Jewish battle cry "''Mi Kamocha B'elim, [[YHWH]]''" ("Who is like you among the heavenly powers, ''GOD''!" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] ''15:11''), "MKBY" (Mem, Kaf, Bet and Yud).</ref> called the people forth to holy war against the Seleucids.  Mattathias' sons [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] (Yehuda), [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]] (Yonoson/ Yonatan), and [[Simon Maccabeus|Simon]] (Shimon) began a military campaign, initially with disastrous results: one thousand Jewish men, women, and children were killed by Seleucid troops because they refused to fight, even in self-defense, on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. Other Jews then reasoned that they must fight when attacked, even on the Sabbath. The institution of [[guerrilla warfare]] practices by Judah over several years led to victory against the Seleucids: <blockquote>"It was now, in the fall of 165, that Judah's successes began to disturb the central government. He appears to have controlled the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and thus to have cut off the royal party in Acra from direct communication with the sea and thus with the government. It is significant that this time the Syrian troops, under the leadership of the governor-general Lysias, took the southerly route, by way of Idumea."<ref>Bickerman, Elias J. ''Ezra to the Last of the Maccabees''. Schocken, 1962. Via [http://www.houseofdavid.ca/maccabee.htm#Bickerman]</ref></blockquote>

In [[164 BCE]] Judah captured Jerusalem and the Temple in Jerusalem was freed and reconsecrated: "After having recovered [[Jerusalem]], Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the Desecrated one, and new holy vessels to be made."<ref>(1 Macc. 4:59)</ref>  The celebratory festival of [[Hanukkah]] is instituted: "When the fire had been kindled anew upon the altar and the lamps of the candlestick lit, the dedication of the altar was celebrated for eight days amid sacrifices and songs."<ref>(1 Macc. 4:36); note the similarity to [[Sukkot]], the Feast of Tabernacles (2 Macc. 10:6 and 1:9), which also lasts for eight days and which was observed in a similar fashion during the time of the Second Temple. (Suk. 5:2<U+2013>4).</ref>

Antiochus IV died that same year, and was ultimately succeeded by [[Demetrius I Soter]], the nephew whose throne he had usurped.  Demetrius sent the general [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] to Israel with a large army, in order to install [[Alcimus]] with the office of high priest (I Macc. 7:8,&nbsp;9); Bacchides subdued Jerusalem and returned to his King. (ib. 7:19,&nbsp;20).

Next, Bacchides was sent with Alcimus and an army of twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and met Judah at the [[Battle of Elasa]] (Laisa), where this time it was the Hasmonean commander who was killed. ([[161 BC|161]]/[[160 BCE]]).  Bacchides now established the Hellenists as rulers in Israel; and upon Judah's death, the persecuted patriots, under Jonathan, brother of Judah, fled beyond the Jordan River.(ib. 9:25&ndash;27)  They set camp near a morass by the name of Asphar, and remained, after several engagements with the Seleucids, in the [[swamp]] in the country east of the Jordan.

Following the death of his [[Puppet state|puppet governor]] [[Alcimus]], High Priest of [[Jerusalem]], Bacchides felt secure enough to leave the country, but two years after the departure of Bacchides from Israel, the [[City of Acre]] felt sufficiently threatened by Maccabee incursions to contact Demetrius and request the return of Bacchides to their territory.  Jonathan and Simeon, now more experienced in [[guerilla warfare]], thought it well to retreat farther, and accordingly fortified in the desert a place called Beth-hogla;<ref>("Bet <U+1E24>oglah" for <U+0392><U+03B7><U+03D1><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03AC> in Josephus; 1 Macc. has <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+1F76>, perhaps = Bet Bosem or Bet Bassim ["spice-house"], near [[Jericho]])</ref> there they were [[siege|besieged]] several days by Bacchides.  Jonathan offered the rival general a [[peace treaty]] and exchange of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Bacchides readily consented and even took an [[oath]] of nevermore making war upon Jonathan. He and his forces then vacated Israel. The victorious Jonathan now took up his residence in the old city of [[Michmash]]. From there he endeavored to clear the land of "the [[Atheism|godless]] and the [[Apostasy|apostate]]".<ref>1 Macc. 9:55&ndash;73; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 1, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 5<U+2013>6).</ref> The chief source, 1 Maccabees, says that with this "the sword ceased in Israel", and in fact nothing is reported for the five following years ([[158 BCE|158]]&ndash;[[153 BCE]]).

An important external event brought the design of the Maccabeans to fruition. [[Demetrius I Soter]]'s relations with [[Attalus II Philadelphus]] of [[Pergamon]] (reigned [[159 BCE|159]]&ndash;[[138 BCE]]),  [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt]] (reigned [[163 BCE|163]]&ndash;[[145 BCE]]), and Ptolemy's co-ruler [[Cleopatra II of Egypt]] were deteriorating, and they supported a rival claimant to the Seleucid throne: [[Alexander Balas]], who purported to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and a first cousin of Demetrius.  Demetrius was forced to recall the garrisons of Judea, except those in the City of Acre and at Beth-zur, to bolster his strength.  Furthermore, he made a bid for the loyalty of Jonathan, permitting him to recruit an army and to reclaim the hostages kept in the City of Acre.  Jonathan gladly accepted these terms, took up residence at Jerusalem in [[153 BCE]], and began fortifying the city.

Alexander Balas offered Jonathan even more favorable terms, including official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem, and despite a second letter from Demetrius promising prerogatives that were almost impossible to guarantee,<ref>I Macc. 10:1&ndash;46; Josephus, "Ant." xiii. 2, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 1&ndash;4</ref> Jonathan declared allegiance to Alexander.  Jonathan became the official leader of his people, and officiated at the [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]] of 153 BCE wearing the High Priest's garments.  The Hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences.

Soon, Demetrius lost both his throne and his life, in [[150 BCE]].  The victorious Alexander Balas was given the further honor of marriage to [[Cleopatra Thea]], daughter of his allies Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II.  Jonathan was invited to Ptolemais for the ceremony, appearing with presents for both kings, and was permitted to sit between them as their equal; Balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honor. Balas appointed Jonathan as [[strategos]] and "meridarch" (i.e., civil governor of a province; details not found in Josephus), sent him back with honors to Jerusalem,<ref>1 Macc. 10:51&ndash;66; Josephus, "Ant." xiii. 4, <U+00A7> 1</ref> and refused to listen to the Hellenistic party's complaints against Jonathan.

====Hasmoneans under Balas and Demetrius II====
In [[147 BCE]], [[Demetrius II Nicator]], a son of Demetrius I Soter, claimed Balas' throne.  The governor of [[Coele-Syria]], Apollonius Taos, used the opportunity to challenge Jonathan to battle, saying that the Jews might for once leave the [[mountain]]s and venture out into the [[plain]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Jonathan and Simeon led a force of 10,000 men against Apollonius' forces in [[Jaffa]], which was unprepared for the rapid attack and opened the gates in surrender to the Jewish forces.  Apollonius received reinforcements from [[Azotus]] and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men including superior cavalry forces.  Jonathan assaulted, captured and burned Azotus along with the resident temple of [[Dagon]] and the surrounding [[village]]s.

Alexander Balas honored the victorious High Priest by giving him the city of [[Ekron]] along with its outlying territory. The people of Azotus complained to King Ptolemy VI, who had come to make war upon his son-in-law, but Jonathan met Ptolemy at Jaffa in peace and accompanied him as far as the River Eleutherus. Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem, maintaining peace with the King of Egypt despite their support for different contenders for the Seleucid throne.<ref>1 Macc. 10:67&ndash;89, 10:1&ndash;7; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 3&ndash;5</ref>

====Hasmoneans under Demetrius and Diodotus====
In [[145 BCE]], the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BCE)|Battle of Antioch]] resulted in the final defeat of Alexander Balas by the forces of his father-in-law Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy himself, however, was among the casualties of the battle. Demetrius II Nicator remained sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire and became the second husband of [[Cleopatra Thea]].

Jonathan owed no allegiance to the new King and took this opportunity to lay siege to the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]], the Seleucid fortress in Jerusalem and the symbol of Seleucid control over Judea. It was heavily garrisoned by a Seleucid force and offered asylum to Jewish Hellenists.<ref>1 Macc. 9:20; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, <U+00A7> 9</ref> Demetrius was greatly incensed; he appeared with an army at Ptolemais and ordered Jonathan to come before him. Without raising the siege, Jonathan, accompanied by the elders and priests, went to the king and pacified him with presents, so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest, but gave to him the three [[Samaritan]] toparchies of [[Mount Ephraim]], [[Lod]], and [[Ramathaim-Zophim]]. In consideration of a present of 300 [[Talent (weight)|talent]]s the entire country was exempted from [[tax]]es, the exemption being confirmed in writing. Jonathan in return lifted the siege of the Acra and left it in Seleucid hands.

Soon, however, a new claimant to the Seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young [[Antiochus VI Dionysus]], son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea. He was three years old at most, but general [[Diodotus Tryphon]] used him to advance his own designs on the throne. In the face of this new enemy, Demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from the City of Acre, but also called Jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops. The 3,000 men of Jonathan protected Demetrius in his capital, [[Antioch]], against his own subjects.<ref>1 Macc. 9:21&ndash;52; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, <U+00A7> 9; 5, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 2&ndash;3; "R. E. J." xlv. 34</ref>

As Demetrius II did not keep his promise, Jonathan thought it better to support the new king when Diodotus Tryphon and Antiochus VI seized the capital, especially as the latter confirmed all his rights and appointed his brother Simon (Simeon) [[strategos]] of the seacoast, from the "Ladder of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]" to the frontier of [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]].

Jonathan and Simon were now entitled to make conquests; [[Ashkelon]] submitted voluntarily while Gaza was forcibly taken. Jonathan vanquished even the strategoi of Demetrius II far to the north, in the plain of Hazar, while Simon at the same time took the strong fortress of Beth-zur on the pretext that it harbored supporters of Demetrius.<ref>1 Macc. 9:53&ndash;74; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 5, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 3&ndash;7</ref>

Like Judah in former years, Jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples. He renewed the treaty with the [[Roman Republic]] and exchanged friendly messages with [[Sparta]] and other places. However, one should note that the documents referring to those diplomatic events are of questionable authenticity.

Diodotus Tryphon went with an army to Judea and invited Jonathan to [[Bet She'an|Scythopolis]] for a friendly conference, where he persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men, promising to give him Ptolemais and other fortresses. Jonathan fell into the trap; he took with him to Ptolemais 1,000 men, all of whom were slain; he himself was taken prisoner.<ref>1 Macc. 12:33&ndash;8, 41&ndash;53; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 5, <U+00A7> 10; 6, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 1&ndash;3</ref>

===Simon assumes leadership===
When Diodotus Tryphon was about to enter Judea at Hadid, he was confronted by the new Jewish leader, Simon, ready for battle. Trypho, avoiding an engagement, demanded one hundred talents and Jonathan's two sons as hostages, in return for which he promised to liberate Jonathan. Although Simon did not trust Diodotus Tryphon, he complied with the request so that he might not be accused of the death of his brother. But Diodotus Tryphon did not liberate his prisoner; angry that Simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing, he executed Jonathan at Baskama, in the country east of the Jordan.<ref>[[143 BCE]]; 1 Macc. 13:12&ndash;30; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 6, <U+00A7> 5</ref> Jonathan was buried by Simeon at Modin. Nothing is known of his two captive sons. One of his daughters was an ancestor of Josephus.<ref>Josephus, "Vita," <U+00A7> 1</ref>

Simon assumed the leadership ([[142 BCE]]), receiving the double office of High Priest and prince of Israel. The leadership of the Hasmoneans was established by a resolution, adopted in [[141 BCE]], at a large assembly "of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land, to the effect that Simon should be their leader and High Priest forever, until there should arise a [[messiah|faithful prophet]]" (1 Macc. 14:41). Ironically, the election was performed in Hellenistic fashion.

Simon, having made the Jewish people semi-independent of the Seleucid Greeks, reigned from [[142 BCE|142]]&ndash;[[135 BCE]] and formed the Hasmonean dynasty.  The [[Roman Senate]] accorded the new dynasty recognition by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] c. [[139 BCE]], when the delegation of Simon was in Rome.

Simon led the people in peace and prosperity, until in February [[135 BCE]], he was [[assassination|assassinated]] at the instigation of his son-in-law [[Ptolemy (son of Abubus)|Ptolemy]], son of [[Abubus]] (also spelled Abobus or Abobi), who had been named governor of the region by the Seleucids.  Simon's eldest sons, Mattathias and Judah, were also murdered.

==Hasmonean expansion and civil war==
[[Image:1stMithritadicwar89BC.png|thumb|left|Hasmonoen Kingdom at its greatest extent under [[Salome Alexandra]]]]
[[File:Hasmoneese rijk.PNG|thumb|The extent of the Hasmonean kingdom.]]
In c.135 BCE, John Hyrcanus, Simon's third son, assumed the leadership and ruled as high priest ([[Kohen Gadol]]) and took a Greek "[[regnal name]]" (see [[Hyrcania]]) in an acceptance of the [[Hellenistic]] culture of his [[Seleucid]] [[suzerain]]s. Within a year of the death of Simon, [[Seleucid]] King [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] attacked Jerusalem. According to [[Josephus]],<ref>Josephus The Jewish Wars (1:60)</ref> [[John Hyrcanus]] opened King [[David]]'s sepulchre and removed three thousand talents which he paid as [[tribute]] to spare the city. He remained as governor as a [[Seleucid]] [[vassal]]. For the next two decades of his reign, Hyrcanus continued, like his father, to rule semi-autonomously from the Seleucids.

The Seleucid empire had been disintegrating in the face of the [[Seleucid<U+2013>Parthian wars]] and in 129 BCE [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] was killed in [[Median Empire|Media]] by the forces of [[Phraates II of Parthia]], permanently ending Seleucid rule east of the [[Euphrates]]. In 116 BCE, a civil war between Seleucid half-brothers [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]] and [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]] broke out, resulting in a further breakup of the already significantly reduced kingdom.

This provided opportunity for semi-independent Seleucid client states such as Judea to revolt.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=j4McAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA465&lpg=PA465&dq=Grypus+Cyzicenus&source=bl&ots=7r0fLoAPkF&sig=gGC3Sv8xKfBXKYlu2lGklhWiDDk&hl=en&ei=f4OfTb7pEaS10QG7-b2VBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Grypus%20Cyzicenus&f=false Lectures on ancient history, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Marcus Carsten Nicolaus von Niebuhr]</ref><ref>[http://christianbookshelf.org/josephus/the_antiquities_of_the_jews/chapter_10_how_upon_the.htm Josephus, chapter 10]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o3zITiLtH-EC&pg=PA24&dq=grypus+hyrcanus&hl=en&ei=T6O0TbixFcy18QP1wdCVDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=grypus%20hyrcanus&f=false Heritage and Hellenism: The Reinvention of Jewish Tradition By Erich S. Gruen]</ref> In 110 BCE [[John Hyrcanus]] carried out the first military conquests of the newly independent Hasmonean kingdom, raising a mercenary army to capture [[Madaba]] and [[Schechem]], significantly increasing his regional influence<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=iEj7FA8InCoC&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=hyrcanus+medeba+110&source=bl&ots=CHjjvpQcZZ&sig=357llCEJ8MiRLcqzffN9MCZYskQ&hl=en&ei=h4GfTZWZOarg0QHWst0q&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hyrcanus%20medeba%20110&f=false Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Bible, Volume 5, William George Smith]</ref><ref>Sievers, 142</ref>

Hyrcanus annexed [[Transjordan|Trans-Jordan]], [[Samaria]], [[Galilee]], and [[Idumea]] (also known as [[Edom]]), and forced Idumeans to convert to Judaism:  <blockquote>"Hyrcanus...subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, (25) and of the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews."<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-13.htm Josephus, ''Ant.'' xiii, 9:1., via]</ref></blockquote>

He desired that his wife succeed him as head of the government, with his eldest of five sons, [[Aristobulus I]], becoming only the high-priest. Aristobulus was the first Hasmonean to take the title [[basilieus]], asserting the new-found independence of the state.

===Pharisee and Sadducee factions===
:''See also: [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]]''.
It is difficult to state at what time the Pharisees, as a party, arose. Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus ("Ant." xiii. 5, <U+00A7> 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.

During the Hasmonean period, the Sadducees and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties. Although the Pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] choose between being king and being High Priest. In response, the king openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]], whose brother was Shimon ben Shetach, a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees. The conflict between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE and inaugurated the Roman period of Jewish history.

Josephus attests that Salome Alexandra was very favorably inclined toward the Pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the institution known as the [[Sanhedrin]]. Later texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the Pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. The influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many. Although these texts were written long after these periods, many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the Second Temple era.

Upon Hyrcanus' death, however, Aristobulus jailed his mother and three brothers, including [[Alexander Jannaeus]], and allowed her to starve there.  By this means he came into possession of the throne, but died one year later after a painful illness in [[103 BCE]].

Aristobulus' brothers were freed from prison by his widow; Alexander reigned from 103&ndash;[[76 BCE]], and died during the siege of the fortress Ragaba. In c.87 BCE, according to [[Josephus]], following a six-year civil war involving Seleucid king [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]], [[Hasmonean]] ruler [[Alexander Jannaeus]] crucified 800 Jewish rebels in Jerusalem.

Alexander was followed by his wife, [[Salome Alexandra]], who reigned from 76&ndash;[[67 BCE]].  She was the only ''[[regnant]]'' Jewish Queen.  During her reign, her son [[Hyrcanus II]] held the office of High Priest and was named her successor.

===Civil war===
Alexander Jannaeus' son, Hyrcanus II, had scarcely reigned three months when his younger brother, [[Aristobulus II]], rose in rebellion, whereupon Hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of an army of [[mercenaries]] and his [[Pharisee]] followers:  "NOW Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother commit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide the dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted Hyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus."<ref>http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html</ref>

Hyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem, but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus II compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest (comp. [[Sch<U+00FC>rer]], "Gesch." i. 291, note 2), but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office: "but Hyrcanus, with those of his party who stayed with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the hostages (which were Aristobulus's wife, with her children) that he might perservere; but the parties came to an agreement before things should come to extremes, that Aristobulus should be king, and Hyrcanus should resign, but retain all the rest of his dignities, as being the king's brother. Hereupon they were reconciled to each other in the Temple, and embraced one another in a very kind manner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their houses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired to the house of Aristobulus."<ref>http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html</ref> Aristobulus ruled from 67&ndash;[[63 BCE]]).

From 63&ndash;[[40 BCE]] the government was in the hands of Hyrcanus II as High Priest and [[Ethnarch]], although effective power was in the hands of his adviser [[Antipater the Idumaean]].

===Intrigues of Antipater===
The struggle would have ended here but for Antipater the Idumean. Antipater saw clearly that it would be easier to reach the object of his ambition, the control of [[Judea]], under the government of the weak Hyrcanus than under the warlike and energetic Aristobulus. He accordingly began to impress upon Hyrcanus' mind that Aristobulus was planning his death, finally persuading him to take refuge with [[Aretas III|Aretas]], king of the [[Nabat<U+00E6>ans]]. Aretas, bribed by Antipater, who also promised him the restitution of the Arabian towns taken by the Hasmoneans, readily espoused the cause of Hyrcanus and advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of fifty thousand. During the siege, which lasted several months, the adherents of Hyrcanus were guilty of two acts that greatly incensed the majority of the Jews: they stoned the pious Onias (see [[Honi ha-Magel]]) and, instead of a lamb which the besieged had bought of the besiegers for the purpose of the paschal sacrifice, sent a pig. Honi, ordered to curse the besieged, prayed: "Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Thy people, I beseech Thee not to answer the evil prayers of either." The pig incident is derived from rabbinical sources. According to Josephus, the besiegers kept the enormous price of one thousand [[drachma]]s they had asked for the lamb.

==Roman intervention==
===Pompey the Great===
[[File:Pomp<U+00E9>e dans le Temple de J<U+00E9>rusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Pompey in the Temple of Jerusalem'', by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
While this civil war was going on the Roman general [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] went to Syria to take possession, in the name of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], of the kingdom of the [[Seleucids]]. The brothers appealed to him, each endeavoring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. At first Scaurus, moved by a gift of four hundred talents, decided in favor of Aristobulus. Aretas was ordered to withdraw his army from Judea, and while retreating suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. But when Pompey came to Syria (63 BCE), a different situation arose. Pompey, who had just been awarded the title "Conqueror of Asia" due to his decisive victories  in [[Asia Minor]] over [[Pontus]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]], had decided to bring Judea under the rule of the Romans. He took the same view of Hyrcanus' ability, and was moved by much the same motives as Antipater: as a ward of Rome, Hyrcanus would be more acceptable than Aristobulus. When, therefore, the brothers, as well as delegates of the people's party, which, weary of Hasmonean quarrels, desired the extinction of the dynasty, presented themselves before Pompey, he delayed the decision, in spite of Aristobulus' gift of a golden vine valued at five hundred talents. The latter, however, fathomed the designs of Pompey, and entrenched himself in the fortress of [[Alexandrium]]; but, soon realizing the uselessness of resistance, surrendered at the first summons of the Romans, and undertook to deliver Jerusalem to them. The patriots, however, were not willing to open their gates to the Romans, and a [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|siege]] ensued which ended with the capture of the city.  Pompey entered the [[Temple of Jerusalem|Holy of Holies]]; this was only the second time that someone had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot. [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] had to pay tribute to [[Rome]] and was placed under the supervision of the Roman governor of Syria: <blockquote>"In 63 BC, Judaea became a protectorate of Rome. Coming under the administration of a governor, Judaea was allowed a king; the governor's business was to regulate trade and maximize tax revenue."<ref>Hooker, Richard. {{cite web |title=The Hebrews: The Diaspora|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8000/~dee/HEBREWS/HEBREWS.HTM|accessdate=2006-01-08}}  World Civilizations Learning Modules.

In 57&ndash;55 BCE, [[Aulus Gabinius]], proconsul of [[Syria (Roman province)#Syria in antiquity|Syria]], split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into Galilee, Samaria, and Judea, with five districts of legal and religious councils known as ''sanhedrin'' (Greek: <U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03AD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD>, "synedrion"):  "And when he had ordained five councils (<U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03AD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03B1>), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at [[Umm Qais|Gadara]], the third at Amathus, the fourth at [[Jericho]], and the fifth at [[Tzippori|Sepphoris]] in Galilee."<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146;query=whiston%20chapter%3D%23182;layout=;loc=14.54 Josephus, ''Ant.'' xiv 54, via]</ref><ref>"Josephus uses <U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03AD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD> for the first time in connection with the decree of the Roman governor of Syria, Gabinius (57 BCE), who abolished the constitution and the then existing form of government of Palestine and divided the country into five provinces, at the head of each of which a sanhedrin was placed ("Ant." xiv 5, <U+00A7> 4)." via [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=229&letter=S&search=Gabinius Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanhedrin]:</ref>

===Pompey and Caesar===
[[Julius Caesar]] initially supported Aristobulus against Hyrcanus and Antipater. Between the weakness of Hyrcanus and the ambition of Aristobulus, Judea lost its independence.  Aristobulus was taken to Rome a prisoner, and Hyrcanus was reappointed High Priest, but without political authority.  When, in 50 BCE, it appeared that [[Julius Caesar]] was interested in using Aristobulus and his family as his clients to take control of Judea from Hyrcanus and Antipater, who were beholden to Pompey, supporters of Pompey had Aristobulus poisoned in Rome and executed Alexander in [[Antioch]].

However, Pompey's pawns soon had occasion to turn to the other side: <blockquote>"At the beginning of the civil war between [Caesar] and Pompey, Hyrcanus, at the instance of Antipater, prepared to support the man to whom he owed his position; but when Pompey was murdered, Antipater led the Jewish forces to the help of Caesar, who was hard pressed at Alexandria. His timely help and his influence over the Egyptian Jews recommended him to Caesar's favor, and secured for him an extension of his authority in Palestine, and for Hyrcanus the confirmation of his ethnarchy. Joppa was restored to the Hasmonean domain, Judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to Rome, and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed."<ref>Bentwich, ''Josephus'', Chapter I, "The Jews and the Romans."</ref></blockquote>

The timely aid from Antipater and Hyrcanus led the triumphant Caesar to ignore the claims of Aristobulus's younger son, [[Antigonus the Hasmonean]], and to confirm Hyrcanus and Antipater in their authority, despite their previous allegiance to Pompey. Josephus noted, <blockquote>"Antigonus... came to Caesar... and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country... and that as to the assistance they had sent [to Caesar] into Egypt, it was not done out of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his enemy] Pompey."<ref>http://www.interhack.net/projects/library/wars-jews/b1c10.htmlM</ref></blockquote>
Hyrcanus' restoration as [[ethnarch]] in 47 BCE coincided with Caesar's appointment of Antipater as the first [[List of Kings of Judea#Hasmonean High Priests and Kings, 153-37 BC|Roman Procurator]], allowing Antipater to promote the interests of his own house: "Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest, and gave Antipater what principality he himself should choose, leaving the determination to himself; so he made him procurator of Judea."<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', [[William Whiston]] translation, xiv 140; at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146&layout=&loc=14.140]</ref>

Antipater appointed his sons to positions of influence: [[Phasael]] became Governor of Jerusalem, and [[Herod the Great|Herod]] Governor of [[Galilee]].  This led to increasing tension between Hyrcanus and the family of Antipater, culminating in a trial of Herod for supposed abuses in his governorship, which resulted in Herod's flight into exile in [[46 BCE]].  Herod soon returned, however, and the honors to Antipater's family continued.  Hyrcanus' incapacity and weakness were so manifest that, when he defended Herod against the Sanhedrin and before [[Mark Antony]], the latter stripped Hyrcanus of his nominal political authority and his title, bestowing them both upon the accused.

[[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] in 44 BCE and unrest and confusion spread throughout the Roman world, including Judaea.  Antipater the Idumean was assassinated by a rival, [[Malichus]], in 43 BCE, but Antipater's sons managed to kill Malichus and maintain their control over Judea and their father's puppet Hasmonean, Hyrcanus.

===Parthian invasion, Antony, Augustus===

After Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BCE, [[Quintus Labienus]], a Roman republican general and ambassador to the [[Parthians]], sided with Brutus and Cassius in the [[Liberators' civil war]]; after their defeat Labienus joined the Parthians and assisted them in invading Roman territories in 40 BCE.  The Parthian army crossed the Euphrates and Labienus was able to entice Mark Antony's Roman garrisons around Syria to rally to his cause.  The Parthians split their army, and under [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]] conquered the Levant from the Phoenician coast through the Land of Israel:  <blockquote>"Antigonus... roused the Parthians to invade Syria and Palestine, [and] the Jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the Maccabean house, and drove out the hated Idumeans with their puppet Jewish king. The struggle between the people and the Romans had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when placed on the throne by the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the Jews, rejoicing at the restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era of independence had come.<ref>Bentwich, Chapter I.</ref></blockquote>  When Phasael and [[Hyrcanus II]] set out on an embassy to the Parthians, the Parthians instead captured them.  Antigonus, who was present, cut off Hyrcanus's ears to make him unsuitable for the High Priesthood, while Phasael was put to death.

Antigonus, whose Hebrew name was Mattathias, bore the double title of king and High Priest for only three years, as he had not disposed of Herod, the most dangerous of his enemies.  Herod fled into exile and sought the support of Mark Antony.  Herod was designated "King of the Jews" by the [[Roman Senate]] in 40 BCE:  Antony <blockquote>"then resolved to get [Herod] made king of the Jews...[and] told [the Senate] that it was for their advantage in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated, Antony and [[Augustus|Caesar]] [Augustus] went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign."<ref>[http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html Josephus, ''Wars of the Jews'', 14.4, via]</ref></blockquote>

The struggle thereafter lasted for some years, as the main Roman forces were occupied with defeating the Parthians and had few additional resources to use to support Herod. After the Parthians' defeat, Herod was victorious over his rival in [[37 BCE]].  Antigonus was delivered to Antony and executed shortly thereafter. The Romans assented to Herod's proclamation as King of the Jews, bringing about the end of the Hasmonean rule over Judea.

===Herod and the end of the dynasty===
Antigonus was not, however, the last Hasmonean. The fate of the remaining male members of the family under Herod was not a happy one. [[Aristobulus III]], grandson of Aristobulus II through his elder son Alexander, was briefly made high priest, but was soon executed ([[36 BCE]]) due to Herod's jealousy. His sister, [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Mariamne]] was married to Herod, but fell victim to his notorious jealousy. Her sons by Herod, [[Aristobulus IV]] and Alexander, were in their adulthood also executed by their father.

[[Hyrcanus II]] had been held by the Parthians since [[40 BCE]]. For four years, until 36 BCE, he lived amid the [[Babylonian Jews]], who paid him every mark of respect. In that year Herod, who feared that Hyrcanus might induce the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited him to return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews warned him in vain. Herod received him with every mark of respect, assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council, while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him. As the last remaining Hasmonean, Hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for Herod.  In the year 30 BCE, charged with plotting with the King of Arabia, Hyrcanus was condemned and executed.

The later Herodian rulers [[Agrippa I]] and [[Agrippa II]] both had Hasmonean blood, as Agrippa I's father was [[Aristobulus IV]], son of Herod by Mariamne I, but they were not direct male descendants, unless Herod was understood as a Hasmonean as per the following synthesis:

According to Josephus, Herod was also of Maccabean descent:
*[[Eleazar Maccabeus]] called Auran brother of [[Judas Maccabeus]] {Josephus [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/JOSEPHUS.HTM Antiquity of the Jews] Book XII/Chapter 9/Section 4}
*Jason son of Eleazar {Ditto: Book XII/Chapter 10/Section 6}
*Antipater I son of Jason {Ditto: Book XIII/Chapter 5/Section 8}
*Antipater II Antipas son of Antipater I {Ditto: Book XIV/Chapter 1/Section 3}
*Herod

==Legacy and scholarship==
While the Hasmonean dynasty managed to create an independent Jewish kingdom, its successes were rather short-lived, and the dynasty by and large failed to live up to the nationalistic momentum the Maccabee brothers had gained.

===Jewish nationalism===
The fall of the Hasmonean Kingdom marked an end to a century of Jewish self-governance, but Jewish nationalism and desire for independence continued under Roman rule, beginning with the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 and leading to a series of [[Jewish-Roman wars]] in the 1st&ndash;2nd centuries CE, including the [[The Great Revolt|Great Revolt]] ([[66]]&ndash;[[73]] [[Common Era|CE]]), the [[Kitos War]] ([[115]]&ndash;[[117]]), and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] ([[132]]&ndash;[[135]]).

During the wars, temporary commonwealths were established, but they ultimately fell to the sustained might of Rome. [[Roman legion]]s under [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]] [[Destruction of Jerusalem|besieged and destroyed Jerusalem]], looted and burned [[Herod's Temple]] (in the year [[70]]) and Jewish strongholds (notably [[Gamla]] in [[67]] and [[Masada]] in 73), and [[Slavery|enslaved]] or [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacred]] a large part of the Jewish population. The defeat of the Jewish revolts against the Roman Empire notably contributed to the numbers and geography of the [[Jewish Diaspora]], as many Jews were scattered after losing their state or were sold into [[slavery]] throughout the empire.

===Jewish religious scholarship===
Jewish tradition holds that the claiming of kingship by the later Hasmoneans led to their eventual downfall, since that title was only to be held by descendants of the line of [[David|King David]].  The Hasmonean bureaucracy was filled with men with Greek names, and the dynasty eventually became very [[Hellenization|Hellenized]], to the annoyance of many of its more traditionally-minded Jewish subjects. Frequent dynastic quarrels also contributed to the view among Jews of later generations that the latter Hasmoneans were degenerate. One member of this school was Josephus, whose accounts are in many cases our sole source of information about the Hasmoneans.
