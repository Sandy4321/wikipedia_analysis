'''Drywall''', also known as '''plasterboard''' or '''gypsum board''', is a panel made of [[gypsum plaster]] pressed between two thick sheets of paper. It is used to make interior walls and ceilings. 

Plasterboard panels are also known as '''wallboard''' (USA, UK, Ireland),{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} '''Gibraltar board''' or '''GIB''' '''wall and ceiling linings''' (in New Zealand, trademark of Winstone Wallboards<ref>[http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/image/Mao46TeA/Mao46TeA062.html]</ref>), '''rock lath''',<ref name="oldhouseweb.com">[http://www.oldhouseweb.com/how-to-advice/repairing-historic-flat-plaster-walls-and-ceilings-introduction.shtml Repairing Historic Flat Plaster Walls and Ceilings By The Old House Web]</ref> '''Sheetrock''' (a trademark of [[USG Corporation]]), '''Gyproc''' (in Australia, a trademark of [[Compagnie de Saint-Gobain]]).

The sheets of the drywall can be made from fiberglass instead of paper to prevent mold growth. Mold growth is common when using paper-based plasterboard that has been exposed to water due to plumbing leaks or floods. 

Drywall construction became prevalent as a speedier alternative to using [[plaster]]-based interior finish techniques, which involved forcefully spreading a substrate of coarse plaster, known as the base (made up of the ''scratch'' coat and (optional) ''brown'' coat), onto the wall's [[lath|lath-work]] before finally applying the smoother [[finish]] coat, each layer added in succession and all by hand (see [[lath and plaster]]).<ref name="National Park Service: Preservation Brief 21: Repairing Historic Flat Plaster--Walls and Ceilings">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/TPS/briefs/brief21.htm#Historical%20Background]</ref> Drywall, by contrast to plaster, requires hand finishing only at the fasteners and joints. The drywall process requires less labor and drying time, lending its name to the panels used in the assembly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==History==
"'''Sackett Board'''" was invented in 1894 by Augustine Sackett. It was made by layering plaster within four plies of wool felt paper. Sheets were 36" x 36" x 1/4" thick with open (untaped) edges."<ref name="gypsum.org">http://www.gypsum.org/mediaguide.html Gypsum Association History of Gypsum Board</ref>

"'''Gypsum Board'''" evolved between 1910 and 1930 beginning with wrapped board edges, and elimination of the two inner layers of felt paper in favor of paper-based facings. Providing efficiency of installation, it was developed additionally as a measure of fire resistance. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drywalltips.org/background.htm | title = Drywall | publisher =  DrywallTips.org  | date =  | accessdate = 2010-12-03 }}</ref> Later [[air entrainment]] technology made boards lighter and less brittle, then joint treatment materials and systems also evolved. "<ref name="gypsum.org"/>

"'''Rock Lath'''" was an early substrate for plaster. An alternative to traditional wood or metal lath, it was a panel made up of compressed gypsum plaster board that was sometimes grooved or punched with holes to allow wet plaster to key into its surface. As it evolved, it was faced with paper impregnated with gypsum crystals that bonded with the applied facing layer of plaster.<ref name="oldhouseweb.com"/>

==Manufacture==
A wallboard panel is made of a [[paper]] liner wrapped around an inner core made primarily from [[gypsum]] plaster, the semi-[[hydrous]] form of [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub><U+00B7><U+00BD> H<sub>2</sub>O). The raw gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub><U+00B7>2 H<sub>2</sub>O, (mined or obtained from [[flue gas desulfurization]] ([[FGD]])) must be [[calcination|calcined]] before use. Kettle or Flash calciners typically use natural gas today. The plaster is mixed with fiber (typically paper and/or [[fiberglass]]), [[plasticizer]], [[foaming agent]], finely ground gypsum crystal as an accelerator, [[EDTA]], [[starch]] or other [[chelate]] as a retarder, various additives that may increase [[mildew]] and/or fire resistance (fiberglass or [[vermiculite]]), [[wax]] emulsion or [[silanes]] for lower water absorption and water. This is then formed by sandwiching a core of wet gypsum between two sheets of heavy paper or fiberglass mats. When the core sets and is dried in a large drying chamber, the sandwich becomes rigid and strong enough for use as a building material.

Drying chambers typically use natural gas today. To dry 1 MSF (1,000 square feet) of wallboard, between 1.75 and 2.49 million [[BTU]] is required. Organic [[dispersants]]/[[plasticiser]]s are used mainly to reduce the amount of water, hence reduce the eventual drying time, needed to produce gypsum slurry flow during wallboard manufacture.<ref>Global Gypsum Magazine, January 2009, p. 18</ref>

== Specifications ==
=== USA and Canada ===
Drywall panels are manufactured in {{convert|48|in|cm}} wide panels in varying lengths to suit the application. Common panel thicknesses are 1/2" (13&nbsp;mm) and 5/8" (16&nbsp;mm), with panels also available in 1/4" (6&nbsp;mm) and 3/8" (10&nbsp;mm). Both 1/2" (13&nbsp;mm) and 5/8" (16&nbsp;mm) panels of TYPE 'X' (a gypsum board with
special core additives to increase the natural fire resistance of regular gypsum board<ref>*[http://www.gypsum.org/pdf/GA-600-09_Print_7_Megs.pdf Gypsum Association - Fire Resistance Design Manual (GA-600-2009)]</ref>) are used where a fire-resistance rating is desired. Regular 5/8" (16&nbsp;mm) panels are used (with or without light gauge resilient metal channels) where additional mass is needed for the reduction of sound transmission.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Drywall provides a thermal resistance [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] (in US units) of 0.32 for 3/8" board, 0.45 for 1/2", 0.56 for 5/8", and 0.83 for 1" board. In addition to increased R-value, thicker drywall has a higher [[sound transmission class]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Europe ===
In the UK and Europe, plasterboard is manufactured in metric sizes, with the common sizes being corollaries of old imperial sizes.

Most plasterboard is made in 120&nbsp;cm wide sheets, though 90&nbsp;cm wide sheets are also made. 120&nbsp;cm wide plasterboard is most commonly made in 240&nbsp;cm lengths, though 270&nbsp;cm and 300&nbsp;cm length sheets are also commonly available.

Commonly used thicknesses of plasterboard available are 12.5&nbsp;mm (modern equivalent of half an inch), typically used for walls, and 9.5&nbsp;mm (modern equivalent of three-eights of an inch), typically used for ceilings. 15&nbsp;mm thick board is commonly available, and other thicknesses are also produced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Plasterboard is commonly made with one of two different edge treatments<U+2014>tapered edge, where the long edges of the board are tapered with a wide bevel at the front to allow for jointing materials to be finished flush with the main board face, and plain edge, used where the whole surface will receive a thin coating (skim coat) of finishing plaster.

== Construction techniques ==
[[Image:Drywall material handler.jpg|thumb|left|Drywall is delivered to a building site on a flatbed truck and unloaded with a forked material handler crane. The bulk drywall sheets are unloaded directly to upper floors via a window or exterior doorway.]]

As opposed to a week-long plaster application, an entire house can be drywalled in one or two days by two experienced [[Drywall mechanic|drywallers]], and drywall is easy enough to use that it can be installed by many amateur home carpenters. In large-scale commercial construction, the work of installing and finishing drywall is often split between the drywall mechanics, or ''hangers'', who install the wallboard, and the ''tapers'' and ''mudmen'', or ''float crew'', who finish the joints and cover the nailheads with [[drywall compound]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Drywall is cut to size, using a large [[T-square]], by scoring the paper on the front side (usually white) with a [[utility knife]], breaking the sheet along the cut, scoring the paper backing, and finally breaking the sheet in the opposite direction. Small features such as holes for outlets and light switches are usually cut using a [[keyhole saw]] or a small high-speed bit in a rotary tool. Drywall is then fixed to the [[wall]] structure with [[nail (engineering)|nails]], glue, or more commonly in recent years, the now-ubiquitous ''drywall [[screw]]s''.

''Drywall fasteners'', also referred to as ''drywall clips'' or ''stops'', are gaining popularity in both residential and commercial construction. Drywall fasteners are used for supporting interior drywall corners and replacing the non-structural wood or metal [[blocking]] that traditionally was used to install drywall. Their function serves to save on material and labour expenses; to minimize call backs due to [[truss uplift]]; to increase [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]; and to make plumbing and electrical installation simpler.

[[Image:Drywall-screws-v1 (1).png|thumb|204px|right|Drywall screws are designed to be self-tapping.]]

Drywall screws heads have a curved taper, allowing them to self-pilot and install rapidly without punching through the paper cover. These screws are set slightly into the drywall. When drywall is hung on [[Framing (construction)|wood framing]], screws having an acute point and widely spaced threads are used. When drywall is hung on [[light-gauge]] [[steel framing]], screws having an acute point and finely spaced threads are used. If the steel framing is heavier than 20-[[gauge]], [[self-tapping]] screws with finely spaced threads must be used. In some applications, the drywall may be attached to the wall with [[adhesive]]s.

[[Image:Screwgun.jpg|right|thumb|Electric screw gun used to drive drywall screws]]

After the sheets are secured to the [[Framing (construction)#Platform framing|wall studs]] or ceiling [[joist]]s, the seams between drywall sheets are concealed using ''joint tape'' and several layers of ''joint compound'' (sometimes called ''mud''). This compound is also applied to any screw holes or defects. The compound is allowed to air dry then typically sanded smooth before painting. Alternatively, for a better finish, the entire wall may be given a ''skim coat'', a thin layer (about 1&nbsp;mm or 1/16&nbsp;inch) of finishing compound, to minimize the visual differences between the paper and mudded areas after painting.

Another similar skim coating is always done in a process called veneer plastering, although it is done slightly thicker (about 2&nbsp;mm or 1/8&nbsp;inch). Veneering uses a slightly different specialized setting compound ("finish plaster") that contains gypsum and lime [[putty]]. This application uses blueboard, which has special treated paper to accelerate the setting of the gypsum plaster component. This setting has far less shrinkage than the air-dry compounds normally used in drywall, so it only requires one coat. Blueboard also has square edges rather than the tapered-edge drywall boards. The tapered drywall boards are used to countersink the tape in taped jointing whereas the tape in veneer plastering is buried beneath a level surface. One coat veneer plaster over dry board is an intermediate style step between full multi-coat "wet" plaster and the limited joint-treatment-only given "dry" wall.

==Water damage and mold==
[[Image:Drywall splotch.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Drywall water damage in a closet.]]
Drywall is easily damaged by exposure to water. While it can be waterproofed through [[Covalent bond|covalent]] [[waterproofing]], if waterproofing is absent or if the waterproofing layer is punctured, [http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/yohoyohe/momo/momo_007.cfm water will cause drywall to swell and eventually disintegrate, requiring replacement]. Drywall is a porous, lightweight substance that [http://www.ncma.org/resources/Marketing%20Resources/Mold%20Materials/Aug03CMD.pdf supports the growth of mold]. It is for this reason that [http://homerenovations.about.com/od/wallsandtrim/a/artgreenboard.htm greenboard] and [[cement board]] is used for rooms expected to have high humidity.

== Fire resistance ==
When used as a component in fire barriers, drywall is a [[passive fire protection]] item. In its natural state, gypsum contains the [[water of crystallization]] bound in the form of [[hydrate]]s. When exposed to [[heat]] or [[fire]], this water is vapourised, retarding heat transfer. Therefore, a fire in one room that is separated from an adjacent room by a fire-resistance rated drywall assembly will not cause this adjacent room to get any warmer than the boiling point (100<U+00B0>C) until the water in the gypsum is gone. This makes '''drywall''' an [[Ablation|ablative]] material because as the hydrates sublime, a crumbly dust is left behind, which, along with the paper, is sacrificial. Generally, the more layers of Type X drywall one adds, the more one increases the fire-resistance of the assembly, be it horizontal or vertical. Evidence of this can be found both in publicly available design catalogues, including, but not limited to DIN4102 Part 4 and the Canadian Building Code on the topic, as well as common certification listings, including but not limited to [[certification listing]]s provided by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] and Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC). "Type X" drywall is formulated by adding glass fibers to the gypsum, to increase the resistance to fires, especially once the hydrates are spent, which leaves the gypsum in powder form. Type X is typically the material chosen to construct walls and ceilings that are required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]].

Fire testing of drywall assemblies for the purpose of expanding national catalogues, such as the [[National Building Code of Canada]], [[Germany]]'s Part 4 of DIN4102 and its British cousin BS476, are a matter of routine [[research and development]] work in more than one nation and can be sponsored jointly by national authorities and representatives of the drywall industry. For example, the [[National Research Council of Canada]] routinely publishes such findings.<ref>[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc41733/nrcc41733.pdf Performance of wood stud shear walls exposed to fire]</ref> The results are printed as approved designs in the back of the building code. Generally, exposure of drywall on a panel furnace removes the water and calcines the exposed drywall and also heats the studs and [[fastener]]s holding the drywall. This typically results in [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of the assembly towards the fire, as that is the location where the [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] occurs, which weakens the assembly, due to the fire influence.

When tests are cosponsored, resulting in code recognized designs with assigned fire-resistance ratings, the resulting designs become part of the code and are not limited to use by any one manufacturer, provided the material used in the field configuration can be demonstrated to meet the minimum requirements of Type X drywall (such as an entry in the appropriate category of the UL Building Materials Directory) and that sufficient layers and thicknesses are used. [[Fire test]] reports for such unique third party tests are confidential.

Deflection of drywall assemblies is important to consider to maintain the integrity of drywall assemblies in order to preserve their ratings. The deflection of drywall assemblies can vary somewhat from one test to another. Importantly, [[penetrant]]s do not follow the deflection movement of the drywall assemblies they penetrate. For example, see [[cable tray]] movement in a [[:Image:Tray cross barrier.jpg|German test]]. It is, therefore, important to test [[firestop]]s in full scale wall panel tests, so that the deflection of each applicable assembly can be taken into account. The size of the test wall assembly alone is not the only consideration for firestop tests. If the penetrants are mounted to and hung off the drywall assembly itself during the test, this does not constitute a realistic deflection exposure insofar as the firestop is concerned. In reality, on a construction site, penetrants are hung off the ceiling above. Penetrants may increase in length, push and pull as a result of operational temperature changes (''e.g.'', hot and cold water in a [[water pipe|pipe]]), particularly in a fire, but it is a physical impossibility to have the penetrants follow the movement of drywall assemblies that they penetrate, since they are not mounted to the drywalls in a building. It is, therefore, counterproductive to suspend penetrants from the drywall assembly during a fire test. As downward deflection of the drywall assembly and buckling towards the fire occurs, the top of the firestop is squeezed and the bottom of the firestop is pulled, and this is motion over and above that, which is caused by the expansion of metallic penetrants, due to heat exposure in a fire. Both types of motion occur in reality, because metal first expands in a fire and then softens once the critical temperature has been reached, as is explained under [[structural steel]]. To simulate the drywall deflection effect, one can simply mount the penetrants to the steel frame holding the test assembly. The operational and fire induced motion of the penetrants, which is independent of the assemblies penetrated, can be separately arranged.

== North American market ==
North America is one of the largest gypsum board users in the world with a total wallboard plant capacity of 42 billion square feet per year (world wide 85 billion square feet per year).<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gypsum/gypsumcs06.pdf Mineral Commodity Summaries, January 2006]</ref> Moreover, the home building and remodeling markets in North America have increased demand the last five years. The gypsum board market is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the housing boom as "an average new American home contains more than 7.31 metric tons of gypsum."<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gypsum/gypsmyb01.pdf Donald W. Olson (2002) ''Gypsum''] History and production</ref>

The introduction in March 2005 of the Clean Air Interstate Rule by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] requires power plants to "cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 73%" by 2018.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/cair/ Clean Air Interstate Rule]</ref> The Clean Air Interstate Rule also requested that the power plants install new scrubbers (industrial pollution control devices) to remove sulfur dioxide present in the output waste gas. Scrubbers use the technique of flue gas desulfurization (FGD), which produces synthetic gypsum as a usable by-product. In response to the new supply of this raw material, the gypsum board market was predicted to shift significantly. However, issues such as mercury release during calcining need to be resolved.<ref>[http://www.flyash.info/2003/75heeb.pdf Mercury Release from FGD Gypsum]</ref>

===Waste===
Because up to 17% of drywall is wasted during the manufacturing and installation processes{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the drywall material is frequently not re-used, disposal can become a problem. Some landfill sites have banned the dumping of drywall. Some manufacturers take back waste wallboard from construction sites and recycle it into new wallboard. Recycled paper is typically used during manufacturing. More recently, recycling at the construction site itself is being investigated. There is potential for using crushed drywall to amend certain soils at building sites, such as clay and silt mixtures ([[bay mud]]), as well as using it in compost.<ref>[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Markets/StatusRpts/Inerts.htm Recycled Inerts]</ref>

== Types available in the USA and Canada==
* Regular white board, from 1/4" to 3/4" thickness
* Fire-resistant ("Type X"), different thickness and multiple layers of wallboard provide increased fire rating based on the time a specific wall assembly can withstand a standardized fire test. Often [[perlite]], vermiculite and [[boric acid]] are added to improve fire resistance.
* Greenboard, the drywall that contains an oil-based additive in the green colored paper covering that provides moisture resistance. It is commonly used in washrooms and other areas expected to experience elevated levels of humidity. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* Blueboard, blue face paper forms a strong bond with a skim coat or a built-up plaster finish providing both water and mold resistance.
* [[Cement board]], which is more water-resistant than greenboard, for use in showers or sauna rooms, and as a base for ceramic tile
* Soundboard is made from wood fibers to increase the sound rating (STC)
* Soundproof drywall is a laminated drywall made with gypsum, other materials, and damping polymers to significantly increase the STC {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* Mold-resistant, paperless drywall {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* [[Enviroboard]], a board made from recycled agricultural materials
* Lead-lined drywall, a drywall used around radiological equipment {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* Foil-backed drywall to control moisture in a building or room {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* Controlled density (CD), also called ceiling board, which is available only in 1/2" thickness and is significantly stiffer than regular white board.
* EcoRock, a drywall which uses a combination of 20 materials including recycled fly ash, slag, kiln dust and fillers and no starch cellulose; it is advertised as being environmentally-friendly due to the use of recycled materials and an energy efficient process.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/bown/2008/product/serious-materials-ecorock Serious Materials EcoRock]. ''Popular Science''.</ref>
* Gypsum <U+201C>Firecode C.<U+201D> This board is similar in    composition to Type X,except that it has more glass fibers,and, it has another ingredient in the gypsum core. This ingredient is a shrinkage-compensating additive, a form of vermiculite. When exposed to high heat, the gypsum core shrinks but the shrinkage-compensating element expands at about the same rate as shrinkage occurs in the water-depleted gypsum.
The gypsum core then is more stable in a fire and  remains in place even after the combined water in the
gypsum has been driven off.

==Levels of finish==
"In 1990, four major trade associations, the Association of Wall and Ceiling Industries International (AWCI), the Ceilings and Interior Systems Construction Association (CISCA), the Gypsum Association (GA), and the Painting and Decorating Contractors of America (PDCA), presented the consensus document Levels of '''Gypsum Board''' Finish. The document was created to "precisely describe" the desired finish of walls and ceilings prior to final decoration. This precise description enables contractors to better understand the requirements of architects and building owners in order to enhance the satisfaction of the client. Specifications that include the Levels of Gypsum Board Finish also promote competitive bidding that allows the bidder to consider the correct labor and materials to finish the wall suitably for its final decoration." [http://www.nationalgypsum.com/resources/techtalk/revisiting.aspx]

The official document (summarized below) is known as [http://www.nationalgypsum.com/literature/GA-214-96.pdf GA-214-96 "Recommended Levels of Gypsum Board Finish"].

===Level 0===
No taping, finishing, or accessories required.

A thin skim coat of joint compound, or a material manufactured especially for this purpose, shall be applied to the entire surface. The surface shall be smooth and free of tool marks and ridges. It is recommended that the prepared surface be coated with a drywall primer prior to the application of finish paint. The skim coat is a final leveling agent suitable to smooth out a surface to be used under the harshest lighting conditions that may otherwise highlight any imperfections under the finished surface.

'''Usage''': Gloss and entirely non-textured surfaces.

==Defective Chinese imports==
{{Main|2009 Chinese drywall controversy}}

There are reports that a substantial amount of defective drywall was imported into the United States from China and incorporated into tens of thousands of homes during rebuilding in 2006 and 2007 following Hurricane Katrina and in other places. Complaints include foul odor, health effects, and corrosion of metal within the structure. The same drywall was sold in Asia without problems resulting, but U.S. homes built much more tightly than homes in China, with less ventilation. A number of lawsuits are underway in many jurisdictions, but many of the sheets of drywall are simply marked, "Made in China", thus making identification of the Chinese manufacturer difficult. An investigation by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], CPSC, was underway in 2009.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/business/08drywall.html "Thousands of U.S. Homeowners Cite Drywall for Ills"] article by Leslie Wayne in ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 7, 2009</ref> In November 2009, the CPSC reported a "strong association" between Chinese drywall and corrosion of pipes and wires reported by thousands of homeowners in the United States. Further findings have shown that volatile sulfur compounds, including [[hydrogen sulfide]], have been detected as emissions from the imported drywall and may be linked to health problems.<ref>http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gD4avarflIqeq856bkEM8jMJRR_wD9C5HGRO0</ref> Volatile sulfur compounds are emitted from many different types of drywall, and at least one investigation has pointed to high levels being emitted from drywalls manufactured in the United States.<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/23/cbsnews_investigates/main5752469.shtml?tag=cbsnewsTwoColUpperPromoArea</ref>
