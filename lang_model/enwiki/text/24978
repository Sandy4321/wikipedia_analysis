'''Blanche of Navarre''' (1226 &ndash; 12 August 1283<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21387.htm#i213867 thePeerage.com]</ref>), also known as '''Blanche of Champagne''', was the daughter of [[Theobald I of Navarre]], [[King of Navarre]] and [[Count of Champagne]], and his second wife [[Agnes of Beaujeu]]. She was a member of the House of Champagne. By her marriage she became Duchess of Brittany.

== Family ==
Her maternal grandparents were Guichard IV, Sire of Beaujeu and his wife Sybille of Flanders, who was daughter of [[Margaret I, Countess of Flanders]] and [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut]]. Blanche's paternal grandparents were [[Theobald III, Count of Champagne]] and his wife [[Blanche of Navarre, Countess of Champagne|Blanca of Navarre]].

It is believed that Blanche was the only child from this union but some<ref>http://fabpedigree.com/s019/f563763.htm</ref> believe that Blanche had a sister Agnes. After her mother's death, Theobald married [[Margaret of Bourbon (1211<U+2013>1256)|Margaret of Bourbon]]. From this marriage Blanche gained some half-siblings including: Margaret, Duchess of Lorraine, [[Theobald II of Navarre]], [[Beatrice of Navarre|Beatrice, Duchess of Burgundy]] and [[Henry I of Navarre]].

== Life ==
Blanche's father became [[King of Navarre]] in 1234, this made her Infanta do<U+00F1>a Blanche de Navarre. 

Blanche was firstly betrothed to [[Otto III, Count Palatine of Burgundy]]<ref>[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/NAVARRE.htm#Blancadied1398 NAVARRE, Medieval Lands]</ref>, the marriage contract was signed on 16 January 1236. However, the engagement was broken. 

Blanche was instead married in 1236 to [[John I, Duke of Brittany]]: the main reason he married Blanche was so he could get [[Navarre]] and Theobald did make John heir to the throne. However John renounced the claim after Margaret of Bourbon gave Theobald two sons. John and Blanche had eight children:
*[[John II, Duke of Brittany]] (3 or 4 January 1239-[[Lyon]] 16 November 1305), married [[Beatrice of England]] and had issue
*[[Peter of Brittany]] (2 April 1241-[[Paris]] 19 October 1268), Lord of Hade
*Alix of Brittany (6 June 1243-2 August 1288), married John of Ch<U+00E2>tillon and had issue
*Theobald (1245<U+2013>1256), died young
*Theobald (died soon after birth)
*Eleanor (1248), died young
*Nicolas of Brittany (1249<U+2013>1261), died young
*Robert (1251<U+2013>1259), died young

Of their eight children, only their eldest three lived to adulthood.

In 1270 Blanche founded the Abbey de la Joie near [[Hennebont]]: she was later buried there. She died in 1283: her husband outlived her by three years. Blanche outlived six of her eight children.
