==Background==
After Dragon relocated to [[Sydney]] in May 1975 they landed a contract with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] when record producer [[Peter Dawkins]] caught one of their performances.<ref name="Ariel"/><ref name="Serge"/><ref name="Howl">{{cite web |url=http://www.howlspace.com.au/en/dragon/dragon.htm |title=Dragon |publisher=Howlspace |editor=[[Ed Nimmervoll]] |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}</ref> Dragon co-founder Ray Goodwin left the group in 1975, so Dragon sent for [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player Paul Hewson who had a reputation, in New Zealand, as a pop songwriter.<ref name="Serge"/> Hewson, ex-Mammal, had been scouted by Dragon when they were still in New Zealand but had declined to join.<ref name="Serge"/> Often courting or creating controversy, the band was rocked by the [[heroin]] [[overdose]] death of drummer Neil Storey in September 1976, aged 22.<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="Miles"/><ref name="Dragon"/> By then, their debut single "This Time" had begun charting.<ref name="Howl"/> After considering disbanding, Todd Hunter consulted with former manager Graeme Nesbitt (ex-Mammal) who advised him to continue and organised for Kerry Jacobson (ex-Mammal) to join on drums.<ref name="Serge"/>
