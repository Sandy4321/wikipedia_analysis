'''Maryland Route 468''' ('''MD 468''') is a [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Maryland]]. The highway runs {{convert|11.19|mi|km}} from Snug Harbor Road in [[Shady Side, Maryland|Shady Side]] north to [[Maryland Route 214|MD 214]] in [[Edgewater, Maryland|Edgewater]]. MD 468 is a J-shaped route that connects Edgewater with the [[Chesapeake Bay]] communities of [[Galesville, Maryland|Galesville]] and Shady Side. The Galesville&ndash;Shady Side road was constructed as part of [[Maryland Route 255|MD 255]] in the 1920s. MD 468 was constructed north of MD 255 in the early 1930s. MD 255 was rerouted to enter Galesville and MD 468 was extended along MD 255's old route to Shady Side in the late 1940s.

==Route description==
MD 468 begins at an intersection with West Shady Side Road, which heads north toward the [[Capt. Salem Avery House]], and Snug Harbor Road, which heads east toward Snug Harbor Park and the Idlewilde peninsula. The highway heads south as two-lane Shady Side Road. MD 468 gradually curves to the west and meets the eastern end of [[Maryland Route 256|MD 256]] (Deale Churchton Road) as the highway passes north of the hamlet of [[Churchton, Maryland|Churchton]]. The highway continues west as Muddy Creek Road and intersects Sudley Road, which provides access to the historic home [[Sudley (Deale, Maryland)|Sudley]]. MD 468 gradually curves to the north and crosses three streams that flow into the [[West River (Maryland)|West River]]. The highway intersects MD 255 adjacent to the Quaker Burying Ground; the highway heads east as Galesville Road into the namesake village and west as Owensville Road. MD 468 passes to the west of three historic homes: [[Tulip Hill]], which is accessed directly from the route; and [[Cedar Park (Galesville, Maryland)|Cedar Park]] and [[Parkhurst (Harwood, Maryland)|Parkhurst]]. After passing Old Muddy Creek Road, an old alignment, the road crosses over several branches of Muddy Creek within the [[Birds Mill Swamp]]. After leaving the swamp, the road passes Contee Wharf Road and South River Clubhouse Road. The former road leads east to the [[Smithsonian Environmental Research Center]] and the latter passes the historic meeting place of the [[South River Club]]. After passing another old alignment of MD 468 in Clydesdale Road, the road meets its northern terminus at MD 214 (Central Avenue) on the southeastern edge of Edgewater.<ref name="Maryland HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps MD 468"/>

==History==
MD 468 originally included Muddy Creek Road from MD 255 north to Edgewater. The portion of MD 468 from MD 255 to Shady Side was part of MD 255 and the highway from the MD 255&ndash;MD 468 intersection east to Galesville was MD 393.<ref name="1939 map"/> The first work done along MD 468's modern course was grading work from the MD 255&ndash;MD 468 intersection south to Sudley Road in 1920.<ref name="1919 src report"/> The gravel highway was completed between those intersections in 1921 and proposed to extend to the modern intersection with MD 256.<ref name="1921 map"/> The highway extended to Deep Creek Road on the south side of Shady Side in 1923.<ref name="1923 map"/> MD 255 was completed to Shady Side in 1929 and 1930.<ref name="1930 src report"/><ref name="1930 map"/> MD 468 was constructed in three sections. The first section from MD 253 (now MD 214) south to near Collins Road was started in 1930 and completed as a gravel road by 1933.<ref name="1930 src report"/><ref name="1933 map"/> The highway was extended south to Lansdale Road in 1932 and 1933.<ref name="1933 map"/><ref name="1934 src report"/> MD 468 was completed to MD 255 in 1933 and 1934.<ref name="1934 src report"/><ref name="1934 map"/> By 1934, traffic on the Galesville&ndash;Shady Side segment was dense enough that the road was recommended to be widened from {{convert|16|to|20|ft|m}}.<ref name="1934 src report"/> MD 468 was extended south along MD 255's route to Shady Side and MD 255 replaced MD 393 into Galesville in 1949.<ref name="1949 map"/> MD 468 originally followed what are now Old Muddy Creek Road and Clydesdale Road.<ref name="1959 map"/> Those curvaceous segments were replaced with current straighter alignment in 1960.<ref name="1960 map"/> MD 468 once extended a short distance along Snug Harbor Road from its present terminus in Shady Side.<ref name="1978 map"/> The highway was retracted to its present terminus by 1987.<ref name="1987 map"/>
