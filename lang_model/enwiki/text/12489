Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts, and contributed to publications including ''[[Mother Earth (journal)|Mother Earth]]'', ''Twentieth Century'', ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]'' ([[Benjamin Tucker]]'s [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] journal), ''The Alarm'' (the journal of the International Working People's Association) and ''The Open Court'' among others. Following the arrest of [[Albert Parsons]], Lum edited ''The Alarm'' from 1892<U+2013>1893.<ref name="selected">{{cite book |last=Cleyre |first=Voltairine |authorlink=Voltairine de Cleyre |title=Selected Works of Voltairine De Cleyre |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |year=2007 |isbn=9781430489382 |pages=284&ndash;296 }}</ref>

Traditionally portrayed as a "genteel, theoretical anarchist", Lum has recently been recast by the scholarship of [[Paul Avrich]] as an "uncompromising rebel thirsty for violence and [[martyrdom]]" in the light of his involvement in the [[Haymarket affair]] in 1886.<ref name="guarneri">{{cite journal |last=Guarneri |first=Carl |month=March |title=Haymarket Through the Anarchists' Eyes |journal=Reviews in American History |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=76<U+2013>79 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0048-7511%28198503%2913%3A1%3C76%3AHTTAE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S |accessdate=2007-11-04 |doi=10.2307/2702014 |year=1985 |last2=Avrich |first2=Paul |unused_data=}}</ref>

Lum was a descendent of the Tappan family; his grandfather was a Revolutionist and secretary to [[Samuel Gompers]].<ref name="shuster"/> In hopes of bringing about the end of [[slavery]], he volunteered to fight on the [[Union Army|Union]] side in the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="infoshop"/> He served as adjunct in the Fourteenth New York cavalry, and later as a [[Brevet (military)|brevet captain]], fighting in the [[Red River Campaign]].<ref name="obit"/> A [[bookbinder]] by trade, he became active in the labor movement in the aftermath of the war and ran for [[lieutenant governor]] of [[Massachusetts]] on the ticket of abolitionist [[Wendell Phillips]] in 1876.<ref name="obit"/>

He became widely known in 1877 after a period traveling across the country as secretary to a [[congressional committee]] appointed to "inquire into the depression of labor."<ref name="obit"/> Between 1880 and 1892, he was an advocate of violence and trade unionism,<ref name="johnpoll"/> and in later years was "the moving spirit of the American group" which worked for the commutation of [[Alexander Berkman]]'s sentence for the latter's [[Henry Clay Frick#Assassination attempt|attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick]].<ref name="shuster"/>
Lum committed suicide in 1893 after suffering from severe depression,<ref name="infoshop"/> although at the time the cause of death was reported in the anarchist press as "fatty degeneration of the heart."<ref name="obit"/>

===Relationship with de Cleyre===
When Lum met [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], he was twenty-seven years her elder and had lived a life rich in experience.<ref name="infoshop">{{cite web |url=http://www.radiovolta.org/articles/decleyre_bio.shtml |title=Voltairine de Cleyre - a biographical sketch |accessdate=2007-08-06 |last=Crass |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Crass |publisher=[[Infoshop.org]]}}</ref> They forged an "unshakable" friendship,<ref name="avrich">{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Avrich |title=An American Anarchist |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1978 |isbn=9780691046570 }}</ref> and Lum had a profound influence on Voltairine de Cleyre's political development,<ref name="avrich"/> which evolved in an opposite direction to his <U+2013> she started out as an orthodox [[Benjamin Tucker|Tuckerite]] individualist, became increasingly involved with the radical labor movement and ultimately called for a [[panarchy|panarchist]] "[[anarchism without adjectives]]".<ref name="carson"/> Their relationship ended after five years of intense involvement, leaving their planned collaborative project<U+2013> a lengthy social and philosophical anarchist [[novel]]<U+2013> ultimately unpublished.<ref name="infoshop"/>

===Involvement in the Haymarket affair===
Lum was closely associated with, and worked alongside the martyrs of the [[Haymarket affair]] in [[Chicago]] in 1886. In an 1891 essay, he wrote that on the afternoon of May 4, [[August Spies]] sent word to the militants that they were not to bring arms to the Haymarket.<ref name="wischmann">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n5_v39/ai_6123691 |title=Remembering the Haymarket anarchists: a hundred years later - Haymarket Square Riots, 1886 |accessdate=2007-08-07 |last=Wischmann |first=Lesley |year=1987 |month=October |publisher=Monthly Review |language=}}</ref> This order was not respected, Lum noted<U+2013> "one man disobeyed that order; always self-determined, he acted upon his own responsibility, preferring to be prepared for resistance to onslaught rather than to quietly imitate the spiritual "lamb led to slaughter."<ref name="wischmann"/> Lum asserted that the eight defendants were initially unaware of the bomb-thrower's identity, although it became known to two of them ("but neither Spies nor [[Albert Parsons|Parsons]]<U+2026>"), believed by [[Paul Avrich]] to be [[George Engel]] and [[Adolph Fischer]].<ref name="haymarket">{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1986 |isbn=9780691006000 }}</ref> In Lum's account, the bomb-thrower's name "was never mentioned in the trial and is today unknown to the public."<ref name="wischmann"/> [[Paul Avrich]] attests that Lum urged Albert Parsons to refuse [[clemency]], and plotted to rescue the anarchists from Cook County Jail by attacking it with explosives.<ref name="guarneri"/> According to de Cleyre, he then [[assisted suicide|assisted the suicide]] of one of the eight defendants, [[Louis Lingg]], by smuggling into Lingg's prison cell a [[dynamite]] cap concealed in a [[cigar]], which Lingg subsequently lit, thereby blowing off half his face and leaving himself lingering for several hours in torturous pain before dying.<ref name="wischmann"/>

Lum's [[political philosophy]] was a fusion of individualist [[anarchist economics]]<U+2013> "a radicalized form of [[laissez-faire]] economics" inspired by the [[Individualist anarchism#The "Boston Anarchists"|Boston anarchists]]<U+2013> with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time.<ref name="carson">{{cite web |url=http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/04/may-day-thoughts-individualist.html |title=May Day Thoughts: Individualist Anarchism and the Labor Movement |last=Carson |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Carson |accessdate=2007-08-07 |work=Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism }}</ref> Lum's ideas have variously been described as [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]],<ref>''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Freedom]]'', vol. 2, no. 17, 1888.</ref> [[anarcho-syndicalist|syndicalist]],<ref name="johnpoll"/> [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]],<ref>{{cite book |page=55 |last=Gay |first=Kathlyn |title=Encyclopedia of Political Anarchy |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara |year=1999 |isbn=0874369827 }}</ref> and an [[anarcho-communist]],<ref>[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]] (2003).

Lum argued in ''The Economics of Anarchy'' that the "[[labor problem]]" was a result of [[state intervention|intervention by the state]] in creating [[monopoly|monopolies]], with particular reference to the land and [[Fiat currency|money monopolies]].<ref name="carson"/> Lum advocated the destruction of the land monopoly, which he saw as a [[government-granted monopoly]], by abolishing [[Title (property)|land titles]] and to allow free access to land, thus making the extraction of rent impossible.<ref name="carson"/> Similarly, mutual banks set up to issue their own currencies would end the state monopoly and undercut the ability of banks and lenders to charge interest.<ref name="carson"/>

{{Bquote|In anarchy labor and capital would be merged into one, for capital would be without prerogatives and dependent upon labor, and owned by it. The laborer would find that to produce was to enjoy and the nightmare of destitution banished. The artisan would find in co-operation that nature alone remained to be exploited. The tradesman would find that production offered greater inducement than exchange, unless he accepted a position of competence and ease in the labor exchange which would supplant isolated stores. The clerk, no longer with his horizon bounded by a ribbon counter, would have full scope to display his talents in any direction. The farmer, above all, free from irksome care to meet interest, to dread foreclosure from enforced taxation, with his family growing up around him, and rendered secure by a common title and mutual inter-dependence, or seeking in insurance indemnity for depredation. would find in anarchy release from useless drudgery and his labor crowned with plentiness and peace.|||Dyer Lum|Chapter 6 of ''Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Scientific Basis'', [[Albert Parsons]] ed.<ref>Lum in chapter 6 of {{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Parsons |title=Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Scientific Basis |publisher=University Press of the Pacific |location=Seattle |year=2002 |isbn=9781410204066 }}</ref>}}

 |quote=That incorrigible cork-screw and exulting defier of logic, Dyer D. Lum, publishes, in the "Rights of Labor," a defense of that deliverance of his in reference to the "scabs" which ''Liberty'' characterized, perhaps not very mildly, but very justly, as a contemptible lie. To reason with Mr. Lum is impossible. He is absolutely dishonest and hopelessly illogical.
