'''Master Chief Petty Officer John-117''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] and the main [[protagonist]] of the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' [[Fictional universe|universe]], created by [[video game developer]] [[Bungie]]. Master Chief is a [[player character|playable character]] in the trilogy of science fiction [[first-person shooter]] video games ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', ''[[Halo 2]]'', and ''[[Halo 3]]''.  Outside of video games, the character appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Uprising]]'', and has cameos in ''Halo'' media including ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel]]'' and ''[[Halo Legends]]''. He is voiced by Chicago disc jockey [[Steve Downes]] in the video games in which he appears.

The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the ''Halo'' series. Originally designed by Bungie artists including Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a towering and faceless [[cybernetics|cybernetically]] [[SPARTAN Project|enhanced supersoldier]]; he is never seen without his green-colored armor or helmet. Downes built his personification of the Chief off a character description which called for a [[Clint Eastwood]]-type character of few words.

The Master Chief has been called a video game icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as [[Mario]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and [[Lara Croft]]. The character has received mixed reception. Reviewers such as [[Kotaku]] have pointed to the Chief's silent and faceless nature as a weakness to the character, while other publications said this attribute allows players to better assume the role of the Master Chief. Gaming magazine ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever.

The task of developing the Master Chief for the character's first appearance in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' fell on Rob McLees and the project's Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art.<ref name="aoh20">{{Cite book|last=Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year=2004|publisher=Del Ray Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-345-47586-0}}</ref> One of Wang's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief; however, after Wang's version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the character looked too slender, "almost effeminate".<ref name=aoh20/> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<ref name=aoh20/> Similarly, the Chief's armor went through various changes, such as the addition of an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904|title=One Million Years B.X.|date=2006-02-10 |publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904|archivedate=2006-02-10}}</ref>

In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's [[Joseph Staten]] noted that, "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," he said, "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space Marine in really cool green armor."<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank|date=2005-05-26|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050526/cifaldi_01.shtml|title=E3 Report: Developing Better Characters, Better Stories|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> The developers spent time considering what rank and branch of the armed forces the Chief would belong to<U+2014>naval ranks grabbed them as "different" from ones the developers had heard of before.

==Attributes==
=== Personality ===
Downes said that his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's written character description provided, which specified a character similar to [[Clint Eastwood]] and of few words. In a [[podcast]] interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality.<ref name="interview1"/> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality."<ref name="frank">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813227p2.html|title=IGN interview with Frankie O'connor|accessdate=2007-09-02|last=Kolan|first=Patrick|date=2006-09-02|publisher=IGN}}</ref> Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as "pretty much the consummate professional.

Despite the Master Chief's excellent combat record, many in the [[Factions of Halo#United Nations Space Command|United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC), the military unit to which he belongs, distrust him. Throughout the storyline, however, he becomes a legend and is looked up to and finally regarded as a hero. Antonio Silva, a UNSC trooper, exemplifies this attitude,<ref name="Nylund2003">{{Cite book|last=Nylund|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Nylund|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year=2003|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-345-46781-7}}</ref> and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated.

===Outward appearance===
In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In-game cutscenes tease the character's face, but never reveal it; for example, at the end of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his head. Bungie did this to help the player bond with the character.<ref name="time">{{Cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|date=2007-08-30|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1657825,00.html|title=The Man in the Mask|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing scene in ''Halo: The Flood'', the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features. His skin is "too white", a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor.<ref name="Dietz"/> The Master Chief stands about seven&nbsp;feet (2.13&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450&nbsp;kg) in armor;<ref>{{Cite book|year=2004 |author=Bungie Studios|title=''Halo 2'' Instruction Manual|publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|page=8}}</ref> without it, he stands six&nbsp;feet, seven&nbsp;inches (2&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 287&nbsp;pounds (130&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Nylund2001">{{Cite book|last=Nylund|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Nylund|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year=2001|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-45132-5}}</ref><ref>Mark MacDonald, "Spartan Specs: Under the Chief's hood," ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 225 (February 2008): 26-27.</ref>

==Appearances==
=== ''Halo: The Fall of Reach'' ===
{{Main|Halo: The Fall of Reach}}
The Master Chief's backstory is never explained in the games. A prequel of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the 2001 novel ''The Fall of Reach'', reveals much of the character's history and was released as a companion to the game. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus II. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with clones to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet Reach, one of the UNSC's headquarters, to begin intense physical and psychological training to become [[SPARTAN-II Project|SPARTAN-II]] supersoldiers.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117. Approximately eight years later, John and the other children are biologically and cybernetically augmented and enhanced. These procedures had substantial risks;<ref name="Nylund2001"/> only John and thirty-two other Spartans survive.<ref name="Nylund2001"/>

After the Spartans' first successful operation which involved capturing a rogue UNSC officer, John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> The Spartans are first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the [[MJOLNIR battle armor|MJOLNIR Mark IV armor]]. In the process, they board a Covenant vessel and plant a bomb; John is forced to leave one of his fellow Spartans, his best friend, to die.<ref name="Nylund2001"/>

In 2552, the Covenant invades the human world of Sigma Octanus and occupies one of its cities, Cote D'Azure.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> Following a failed Marine assault, John-117 and three teams of Spartans are sent to destroy the Covenant force with a nuclear warhead. After detonating the weapon, the Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) [[Cortana]] during a training mission.<ref name="Nylund2001"/> A massive Covenant armada of 700 ships, compared to the UNSC home fleet of 314 ships,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|date=2004 |platform=Xbox|level=Cairo Station|quote='''Cortana''': Fifteen Covenant capital ships, holding position just outside the killzone. / '''Lord Hood''': Something's not right.

===''Halo: Combat Evolved''===
{{Main|Halo: Combat Evolved|Halo: The Flood}}
The Master Chief first appears in the games as the protagonist of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. In ''Halo: The Flood'', the 2003 novelization of the video game, the Chief is likewise the main character. During the opening cinematic of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting [[slipspace]], the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'' is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]], a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, the Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]], as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the Flood.<ref name="bigblow">{{cite video game|title=Halo: Combat Evolved|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|date=2001 |platform=Xbox|level=Two Betrayals|quote='''Cortana''': You have no idea how this ring works, do you? Why the forerunners built it? Halo doesn't kill Flood, it kills their food. Humans, Covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible. The only way to stop the Flood is to starve them to death. And that's exactly what Halo is designed to do: wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient life. You don't believe me? Ask him. / '''Master Chief''': Is this true? / '''343 Guilty Spark''': More or less. Technically, this installation's pulse has a maximum effective radius of twenty-five thousand light years. But, once the others follow suit, this galaxy will be quite devoid of life, or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the Flood.}}</ref> The Covenant accidentally releases the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo: Combat Evolved|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|date=2001 |platform=Xbox|level=343 Guilty Spark|quote='''343 Guilty Spark''': Someone has released the Flood.

However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death.<ref name="bigblow" /> Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo: Combat Evolved|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|date=2001 |platform=Xbox|level=Two Betrayals|quote='''Cortana''': We can't let the monitor activate Halo.

===''Halo: First Strike''===
{{Main|Halo: First Strike}}
''Halo: First Strike'', the 2003 novel by [[Eric Nylund]], follows the Master Chief after the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and bridges the events of ''Halo'' and ''Halo 2''. Floating in Halo's debris field, Cortana and the Chief discover that there are in fact other human survivors.<ref name="Nylund2003"/> The Master Chief and these soldiers capture the Covenant flagship ''Ascendant Justice'', and return to Reach to save any UNSC survivors on the planet. At Reach, the Master Chief discovers that the Covenant had not destroyed the planet's [[biosphere]] in the usual manner, and that a few other Spartans survive. The Chief retrieves [[Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey]], the creative genius behind the SPARTAN-II Project, and his fellow soldiers. The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station, the ''Unyielding Hierophant'', thus delaying a Covenant assault on Earth.<ref name="Nylund2003"/>

===''Halo 2''===
{{Main|Halo 2}}
The Master Chief returns as one of two playable characters in ''Halo 2'', the 2004 sequel to ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Returning to Earth with heavily damaged armor, the Master Chief receives an upgrade. Aboard Cairo Station in space, he attends a brief awards ceremony, which is interrupted by a Covenant invasion. Master Chief is commanded to protect the station.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|date=2004 |platform=Xbox|level=Cairo Station|quote='''Lord Hood''': They're going to try to take our MAC guns offline, give their capital ships a straight shot at Earth. Master Chief... defend this station.}}</ref> The Covenant is repelled, and the Master Chief joins the ship ''[[In Amber Clad]]'' to fight the Covenant on Earth's surface, in New Mombasa. As the Covenant departs via [[Slipstream (science fiction)|slipspace]], the ''In Amber Clad'' follows them to [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 05|Installation 05]], another Halo. The Master Chief lands on this Halo and subsequently [[assassination|assassinates]] the Covenant [[Hierarchs (Halo)|High Prophet]] of Regret. Emerging from a structure, the Master Chief is attacked by orbiting Covenant forces, but is rescued by the [[Gravemind]], an intelligence of Flood origin. The Gravemind sends him to [[High Charity]] to search for Delta Halo's Index.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|developer=Bungie Studios|publisher=Microsoft|date=2004 |platform=Xbox|level=Gravemind|quote='''Gravemind''': If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you. There is still time to stop the key from turning, but first it must be found. You will search one likely spot... and you will search another. Fate had us meet as foes, but this ring will make us brothers.}}</ref> Subsequently, the Master Chief boards a Forerunner ship bound for Earth, intending to "finish the fight".

===''Halo: Uprising'' and ''Halo 3''===
{{Main|Halo: Uprising|Halo 3}}
The Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel's [[limited series]] ''Halo: Uprising'', in which he breaks into a Covenant-held Forerunner structure before being captured by the Covenant.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bendis|first=Brian Michael|title=[[Halo: Uprising]], Book 1|year=2007|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=New York}}</ref> Like ''First Strike'', the comic serves as a bridge between two video games, ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'', in which Master Chief is again the main character.

Back on Earth, the Master Chief helps to repel hostile Covenant forces from [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Voi]]. With the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] (a [[Covenant Elite]] who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads the assault on a Forerunner artifact that the Covenant [[Characters of Halo#The High Prophets|Prophet of Truth]] is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the Flood lands on Earth.<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=Floodgate |quote='''Arbiter''': What is it?

The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing ''High Charity'' through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the ''new'' Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate ''Forward Unto Dawn''. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the ''Dawn'' in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, "Wake me, when you need me." If the player finishes the last level on Legendary difficulty, a cutscene shows the severed half of the ship floating near an unknown planet.<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=Halo |quote='''Cortana''': I'll miss you. / '''Master Chief''': Wake me.

==Influences and analysis==
[[IGN]] saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon 6725416, a character in [[Christopher Rowley]]'s novel ''Starhammer''.<ref name="Perry">{{Cite web|last=Perry|first=Douglass|date=2006-05-16|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/709/709122p1.html|title=The Influence of Literature and Myth in Videogames|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> Other reviewers have suggested that the name John-117 could be a Biblical reference.<ref name="Park"/><ref name="Perry"/> Michael Nitsche of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] found similarity to [[Gordon Freeman]], the protagonist of [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]] of FPS video games: "[Both characters] are the independent, individualistic, and often lonely heroes that gain admiration by constantly proving their superiority ... in technology-driven, hostile, often closed spaces".<ref name="Nitsche 218">{{Cite book|last=Nitsche|first=Michael|year=2008|title=Video Game Spaces: Image, Play, and Structure in 3D Worlds|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=9780262141017|page=218}}</ref>

Roger Travis, associate professor of classics at the [[University of Connecticut]], compared the Master Chief to the epic hero [[Aeneas]], in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Travis|first=Roger|date=October 10, 2006|title=Bungie's Epic Achievement: Halo and the Aeneid|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/384-Bungie-s-Epic-Achievement|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

[[Matthew Stover]] compared ''Halo'' to the ''[[Iliad]]'', saying that both stories share the meta-theme that "war is the crucible of character". As [[military science fiction]], ''Halo'' further raises the issue of being human.<ref name="Stover">{{Cite book|last=Stover|first=Matthew Woodring|authorlink=Matthew Stover|chapter=You Are the Master Chief|title=Halo Effect: An Unauthorized Look at the Most Successful Video Game of All Time|editor=Yeffeth, Glenn (ed.)|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|location=[[Dallas, Texas]]|year=2006|pages=1<U+2013>10}}</ref> Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a [[cyborg]], neither a flawless machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed.<ref name="Stover"/> This immersion has facilitated the use of the ''Halo'' series' multiplayer mode for live [[digital puppetry]], as in Chris Burke's [[machinima]] talk show ''[[This Spartan Life]]''.<ref name="Nitsche 214-215">{{Cite book|last=Nitsche|first=Michael|year=2008|title=Video Game Spaces: Image, Play, and Structure in 3D Worlds|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=9780262141017|pages=214<U+2013>215}}</ref>
