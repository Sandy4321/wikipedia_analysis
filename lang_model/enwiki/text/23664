'''''Letoya''''' is the 2006 debut album by [[United States|American]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[LeToya Luckett]]. The album debuted at #1 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200]] and as well as on the Hot R&B & Hip Hop albums, selling over 165,000 copies in its first week. And spawned "[[Torn (LeToya Luckett song)|Torn]]", "[[She Don't]]" and "[[Obvious (LeToya song)|Obvious]]", as singles. Besides the officially released singles, LeToya's debut album also includes the promo singles, "[[You Got What I Need]]" and "[[All Eyes On Me]]". LeToya co-wrote 10 out of the 14 tracks.


==History==
===Production===

LeToya had "bottled up so many things, so many emotions, so many ideas" accumulated in many years away from the music world (as her claims on the Intro song ''"too much to tell ya"''), with such things like her dismissal from [[Destiny's Child]], the deception with the shortly-formed [[Anjel]] and subsequent search for a new record deal has apparently made her a stronger person. Finally with a record deal, LeToya entered in studios, recording songs produced by many important CEO's names, like [[Dave Young]], [[Scott Storch]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Bryan Michael Cox]], [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Just Blaze]], [[Johnta Austin]], [[J. R. Rotem|Jonathan "JR." Rotem]], [[Mike City]]. Finally about two years making plans to the release the album came out, surprisingly becoming a number one album through the USA.

===Chart performance===
''LeToya'' debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first week sales of 165,000 copies and at number one on the ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming the second Destiny's Child member to reach that position on SoundScan Mainstream Chart as a solo artist. To date, the album has been certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] for shipments of 1 million copies.

The first [[single (music)|single]] off the album was "[[You Got What I Need]]", with non commercial purpose, but "[[All Eyes on Me (LeToya song)|All Eyes on Me]]", the second single, is claimed as her "Original" first single, as this is the first track that showcased her as a solo artist. "Torn" claimed as the first official single from the album which was released in March 2006 and soon became a hit having a high [[airplay (song)|airplay]], just missing out the top ten on the U.S. [[Hot 100 Airplay]] charts at number eleven. "Torn" became a hit on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], peaking at number two. It also entered the top twenty on the [[Rhythmic Contemporary|Rhythmic Top 40]] and Adult R&B charts. In same year, the song was finally released worldwide, namely the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]] and became a moderate worldwide hit. Torn had one of its biggest successes on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]''. It reached number one in eleven days and stayed there for twenty-five days straight. It remained on the countdown for sixty-five days.

===Samples===
