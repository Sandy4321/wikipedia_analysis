'''Shinnecock Reservation''' is an [[Indian reservation]] for members of the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation]] in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[Long Island]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. It lies on the east side of [[Shinnecock Bay]] in southeastern Long Island, adjacent to the communities of [[Southampton (village), New York|Southampton]], [[Tuckahoe, Suffolk County, New York|Tuckahoe]], and [[Shinnecock Hills, New York|Shinnecock Hills]].  The population was 504 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].

On December 15, 2009, the New York Times reported an announcement by the Obama administration that the Shinnecock Indians on Long Island meet the criteria for federal recognition, signaling the end of a 30-year court battle.<ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. Eases Way to Recognition for Shinnecock |first=Danny |last=Hakim |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/nyregion/16tribe.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref>  This will enable the tribe to move forward with its plans for a casino in New York City or its suburbs.  The announcement all but assures that the 1,066-member Shinnecock Indian Nation will receive formal federal recognition, following a public-comment period of up to six months which must be held before the final order is issued.

The reservation is recognized by [[New York State]] but not the U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] -- a discrepancy which has defined the lines in proposals for the reservation to introduce [[Indian gaming]].
==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Indian reservation has a total area of 1.3073 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]] (3.3859 [[km<U+00B2>]] ), all land.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 504 people, 179 households, and 119 families residing in the Indian reservation.  The [[population density]] was 385.5/[[mi<U+00B2>]] (148.5/[[km<U+00B2>]]).  There were 194 housing units at an average density of 148.4/mi<U+00B2> (57.2/km<U+00B2>).  The racial makeup of the Indian reservation was 3.97% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 2.38% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 91.07[[%]] [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.20% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 1.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.99% from two or more races.

The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 90.9 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.6 males.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was [[Dollar sign|$]]14,055, and the [[median income]] for a family was $14,143. Males had a median income of $28,750 versus $13,750 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the Indian reservation was $8,843.  About 61.3% of families and 50.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 66.1% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

== Tribal recognition & gambling prospects ==
The Shinnecock Nation has been asking for Federal recognition from the United States Government since 1978.
The Shinnecock Nation plans to build a casino, which is being fought by the Southampton town. But the Nation has some associates: they get funding from [[Marian Bayoff Ilitch|Marian Ilitch]]-owned [[Gateway Casinos Resorts, LLC]], and support from California Rep. [[Richard Pombo]] (R) who sponsored a new bill in Congress, H.R. 512, to speed up federal recognition for some tribes.  Pombo got money for his 2006 campaign at a [[Mike Ilitch]]-backed [[Richard Pombo#Corruption and Tom DeLay.2FJack Abramoff|fundraiser]]. [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20050713-0004-ca-pombo-money.html]   Disclosure documents on file with the Secretary of the U.S. Senate indicate that the Shinnecock Indian Nation and their partners (Gateway Casino Resorts, LLC and [[Michael J Malik Sr.]] dba MJM Enterprises and MJM Enterprises & Development) have paid D.C. lobbyists $1,140,000 since 2004.[http://sopr.senate.gov/cgi-win/m_opr_viewer.exe?DoFn=0]
