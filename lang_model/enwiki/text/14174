Originally designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], he appears in ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' as a [[clown]]-like, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who acts as the game's main antagonist. He also appears in the spinoff [[fighting game]]s ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'', wherein he is voiced by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in Japanese and [[Dave Wittenberg]] in English.

==Character design==
Kefka's appearance was designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], who was given complete creative control over ''Final Fantasy VI'' with the brief character outlines he was handed, designing them to feel "alive" within his imagination though with consideration for the representation as small computer [[sprite (graphics)|sprites]].<ref>{{cite book |editor= |title=Japan: Final Fantasy |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |date=August 11, 1994 |publisher=[[NTT Publishing]] |language=Japanese |isbn=4-87188-338-8 |chapter=Interview |pages=108<U+2013>109}}</ref> 

==Attributes==
===Personality===
Given only the artwork and outline to work with during production, writer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] felt that one early scene of the character approaching a castle was too "boring to make completely normal", and decided to [[ad-lib]] a scene with one of his accompanying soldiers being requested to dust off his boots in the middle of a desert.<ref name="strange"/> The scene set the tone for Kefka's personality from that point onwards as a result, suggesting there "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head."<ref name="strange">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9002538&publicUserId=6049935 |title=The Making of Dissidia Final Fantasy - Final Words from the Producer |author=Kitase, Yoshinori |authorlink=Yoshinori Kitase |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=2009-10-21 |date=2009-08-27}}</ref> He has been described as "powerful" and "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for his delegating.<ref name="alot"/> As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem, and thus as he attains godlike powers he thirsts the destruction of all life, chanting to his enemies the word hate, expressing his loathing of everything in existence.<ref name="camp"/> The game features a song called "Kefka", which exemplifies the "sadistic joy" of the character.<ref name="eighteen"/>

===Outward Appearance===
Kefka is well known for his clown like apparel, which some have compared to [[the Joker]] from [[Batman]].<ref name="alot"/> His dress has been described as "garish", with "makeup smeared across his face" and "a shrill, girlish laughter" that is thought to "punctuate his madness"<ref name="camp"/><ref name="eighteen"/>

=== Final Fantasy VI ===
Kefka first appears as a general under the game's primary antagonist [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Emperor Gestahl|Emperor Gestahl]], serving as his court [[mage]].<ref name="alot">{{cite web| url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2007/12/18/gaming-to-anime-final-fantasy-vi |title=Gaming to Anime: Final Fantasy VI |publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Ramsey Isler |date=December 17th, 2007|accessdate=March 3rd, 2013}}</ref> Prior to the start of the game, he was the first human to be experimentally infused with the [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Magic|magic]]-like craft "Magitek," which granted him the ability to wield magic, although the imperfect process warped his mind and made him into the [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] [[psychopath]] he is during the course of the game.<ref>'''Vector citizen:''' Here's one for you...

==Influences and Analysis==
[[Konami]] video game developer Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka did not have shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that turned him into a sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't "evil for evil's sake." There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn't any good in there."<ref name="memory">Hulett, Tom (2006-10-09).
