The '''Egyptian Theatre''' in [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], [[Illinois]], United States is an [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] theatre that is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The theatre was built in 1928 and 1929 as part of a much larger wave of national fascination with [[Ancient Egypt]] throughout the United States, due, in large part, to the discovery of [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]]'s tomb in 1922. The theatre was added to the National Register in 1978 and it's 1,430-seat auditorium is currently [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]]'s largest. 

The building was designed by architect [[Elmer F. Behrns]], who had an interest in [[Egyptology]]. The interior and exterior architecture reflect Egyptian cultural symbols. [[Stained glass]] work exhibits designs such as [[Ra]], the Egyptian sun god and the [[Dung_beetle#Scarab_in_Ancient_Egypt|scarab]], a sacred Egyptian symbol. The building was nearly demolished in the 1970s but a restoration effort led by Preservation of the Egyptian Theatre (PET) saved the structure. Rumors have long surrounded the DeKalb Egyptian about secret messages hidden in the architecture and [[haunting]]s.<ref name=star/> While the theater maintains there are no hidden messages in the theater the ghost stories have persisted through the years. The Egyptian Theatre operates a 42 week season with up to 75 annual events.

==History==
When the theatre opened, in 1929, it was one of many so-called [[Egyptian Theatre]]s across the United States. Of those Egyptian theatres, the DeKalb theatre is one of a handful still standing as of 2004.<ref name=niu>[http://dig.lib.niu.edu/dekalb/hist-egypt.html Egyptian Theatre], Wild Prairie Digitization Project, ''Northern Illinois University'', 2004. Retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]].</ref> In the original design, additional buildings were supposed to be attached to the existing building, but they were never built due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] in late 1929. For instance, there was to be a hotel attached to the north side of the building. In its earliest days, the theatre specialized in [[silent film]]s and live [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] performances. 

As decades passed, the theatre became more focused on [[film]] presentations and remained so throughout the 1940s, '50s and '60s. By the 1970s the theatre was in disrepair and the plaster walls were crumbling. The owner handed the theatre over to the city of DeKalb. In 1978 a group of citizens banded together to restore and save the Egyptian. When the Egyptian received designation as a [[Registered Historic Place]] in 1980, the group, Preservation of the Egyptian Theatre (PET), qualified for a [[United States dollar|US$]]2.3 million grant from the state of [[Illinois]]. This money allowed the [[building restoration|restoration]] of the theatre to begin.<ref name=star2>Bartholomew, Steven. [http://www.northernstar.info/articles/?id=29322 Landmark Egyptian Theatre needs help of DeKalb residents], ''Northern Star'', [[21 September]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]].</ref> It was estimated at that time that $3.5 million was needed to completely restore the theatre. Due to the shortfall, there were many projects that had to be cut, including adding [[air conditioning]] which the building never had, and still does not have.

As of 2007, the theatre is preserved, operated and staffed by PET.<ref name=pethome>"[http://www.egyptiantheatre.org/index.html Preservation of the Egyptian Theatre]," official site, Home page. Retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]].</ref> A [[non-profit organization]], PET was formed in the 1970s to save the theatre from destruction. Since the 1980s restoration the theatre has been host to a variety of films and events.<ref name=about>[http://www.egyptiantheatre.org/current_projects.html Current Projects], About Preservation of the Egyptian Theatre, Preservation of the Egyptian Theatre, 2006.</ref> The current [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] is the fourth to adorn the theatre; it was installed during the 1982 restoration.<ref name=history/>

The DeKalb Egyptian has a 42-week season during which it features around 75 events annually. The Egyptian's season is cut short by the hot northern Illinois summers; the theatre has no air conditioning. In addition, more than thirty professional groups used the theatre in 2006 as well as student organizations and university departments from nearby [[Northern Illinois University]].<ref name=star>Thorne, Evan.

==Architecture==
Though the DeKalb Egyptian Theatre is one of up to one hundred Egyptian-style theatres built during the early 20th century, it is believed to be one of the few remaining in the United States.<ref name=niu/>  This particular theatre is more than a simple hodgepodge of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] and Egyptian symbols. The architect, [[Elmer F. Behrns]], himself interested in [[Egyptology]], designed the Egyptian Theatre in DeKalb to have one central theme. Behrns' motif for the DeKalb Egyptian was that of [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramses II]].<ref name=history>"[http://www.egyptiantheatre.org/history.html The History of the Egyptian Theatre]," ''Preservation of the Egyptian Theatre'', official site, 2006. Retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]]</ref>
[[Image:DeKalbEgyptian4.jpg|thumb|right|The [[scarab]] is a prominent Egyptian symbol in the [[stained glass]] work on the front facade of the theatre.]]
The exterior facade is covered in a light sage [[terra cotta]] and exhibits a 20 [[Foot (unit)|foot]] (6.1 [[meter|m]]) tall [[stained glass]] window, which bears the ancient [[scarab]] symbol. The scarab is holding up the sun god [[Ra]] whilst standing on top of the Earth. To each side of the stained glass window, the building's facade holds two huge pharaohs, meant to "guard" over the theatre entrance. The entirety of the theatre's front facade is designed to resemble the gate of a great temple.<ref name=history/>

The small outer lobby is meant to evoke feelings of entering the outer chamber of an ancient Egyptian [[tomb]]. The walls of the outer lobby are built from huge unadorned blocks with a [[faux]] [[sandstone]] surface. The front of the ticket box office is decorated in a dusky [[sienna]] red with a golden sunburst emblazoned above the window. Past the outer lobby of the DeKalb Egyptian Theatre, through the glass doors and into the main lobby, the original [[mosaic]]-tiled floor and the towering 40 foot (12.2 m) ceiling are both revealed.<ref name=history/>

The walls of the main lobby are cream-colored [[plaster]], surrounded by eight [[pillar]]s and [[cornice]]s adorned with golden [[lotus]] blossoms and [[Arecaceae|palm]] leaves. High up the walls, between each of the pillars, are six large golden plaster [[urn]]s. The urns are decorated with [[lotus]] blossom buds and palm leaves as well. They are crowned by a [[gilding|gilded]] design incorporating outstretched [[falcon]] wings and the disc of the sun entwined with golden serpents. The lotus motif is repeated on the frosted wall [[sconce]]s below the urns and on the [[chandelier]] hanging over the center of the [[double staircase]]; the staircase, at the end of the main lobby, leads to the [[mezzanine]] and [[balcony]].

The decoration and layout of the auditorium is meant to resemble a royal Egyptian [[courtyard]].<ref name=history/> The stage is small, at 35 feet (10.7 m) across, because of its original use as a vaudeville theatre.<ref name=chron1/> When the theatre originally opened it had seating for 1,600 guests, since the 1980s renovation that dropped to 1,483 seats. Four more seats were removed in the fall of 2000 to comply with disability laws.<ref name=chron1>Carroll, Rob. "[http://www.daily-chronicle.com/articles/2000/08/21/news/export241.txt Hidden Treasure: Egyptian Theater boasts rich history]," ''Daily Chronicle'', [[21 August]] [[2000]]. Retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]].</ref> The 1,430-seat auditorium is [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]]'s largest.<ref name=star/>

==Hauntings==
The DeKalb Egyptian, like many other Egyptian Revival structures, is meant to create an air of mystery. The imagery of the ancient Egyptian symbols has fostered the popular belief that there is a hidden meaning behind the architecture and color scheme in and on the DeKalb Egyptian<ref name=star/>. The theatre said through a spokesman in 2006 that both the colors and the decorations were chosen for their beauty and no other reason.<ref name=star/>

While there are no hidden messages in the architecture, there have been numerous occurrences and reports of alleged [[ghost]]ly phenomena. The Egyptian has been widely rumored to be the home of two ghosts. One is said to be that of Irv Kummerfeldt, co-founder of PET; Kummerfeldt had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died at the top of "Aisle One" in the Egyptian Theatre's auditorium. His ghost has been reported in that area of the theatre ever since.<ref name=star/> The second ghost, "Bob," as theatre workers and preservationists have dubbed it, is much more free roaming. Bob has been seen throughout the building; objects have moved on their own, doors have opened on their own, and people have felt a tap on their shoulder when no one else is around. Occasionally, footsteps have been heard echoing across the [[auditorium]].<ref name=star/> The theatre operators and preservationists lend enough credence to the ghost sightings and stories to have a board member of PET, the member in charge of the archives, keep an eye out for any information on who the ghost might have been.<ref name=star/>

==Significance==
The theatre is one of the few remaining [[Egyptian Theatre|Egyptian theatre]]s in the United States. Depending on which estimates are utilized there are six or more [[Egyptian Revival]] theatres remaining in the United States.<ref name=niu/> The Illinois Main Street association called the DeKalb Egyptian "one of Illinois' great buildings."<ref name=ims>"[http://www.standingupforillinois.org/mainstreet/dekalb.php DeKalb]," Illinois Main Street, ''Lt. Gov. Par Quinn''.
