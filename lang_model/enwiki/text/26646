{{Harringay}}

'''Harringay Arena''' was a sporting and events venue on Green Lanes in [[Harringay]], North [[London]]. Built in 1936, it lasted as a venue until 1958.

==Construction==

The Arena was built and owned by Brigadier-General [[Alfred Critchley]] under the auspices of his private company, the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA).

The Arena, built adjacent to [[Harringay Stadium]], was a stark [[modernist]] octagonal-shaped building which borrowed heavily from the [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in [[Toronto]]. It was erected in just eight months between February and October 1936. Its vast steel roof was constructed by a company called [[Dorman Long]] & Co who had recently been responsible for the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and have just completed the new [[Wembley Stadium]].

It had a seating capacity of almost 10,000 for [[ice hockey]] and slightly more for [[boxing]]. A removable maple floor could be laid over the ice for non-sporting events. This arrangement clearly proved troublesome. At an event shortly after its opening the ''[[Daily Herald]]'' reported that "claims that Harringay had solved its cold-feet problem were not quite substantiated. Cold air from the ice below the boards filtered through".

==Sports Venue==

Specifically designed as an [[ice hockey]] venue, it quickly became famous as a venue for both [[ice hockey]] and [[boxing]]. 

Up to the [[Second World War]], ice hockey enjoyed its most popular era in the UK until a revival in the 1990s. Two local teams were formed for its opening, [[Harringay Racers]] and [[Harringay Greyhounds]]. However, the interruption of the war proved very damaging to the sport's popularity and post-war audiences remained thin up to 1958.

Boxing became firmly established at the Arena prior to the war. In 1938 it was the venue for the first boxing match to be televised live. Following the war Harringay was a very successful boxing venue. During it's 22 year life, it was home to five world title fights, a record for any British venue in 1958.

However famous the Arena became for boxing, commercial necessity led to a diversification into a wider range of events including:
*The basketball competition for the 1948 London Olympic Games.
*The Arena was home to the [[Horse of the Year]] show for its first ten years, from 1947 onwards. In 1958, the show featured in the first broadcast of the BBC's new Saturday afternoon sports programme ''[[Grandstand]]''.
*An event, unique to the Harringay Arena in 1953, was the American event The ''[[Roller Derby]]''.
*[[ice skating]]{{fact|November 2007}}

==Entertainment Venue==

The Arena's diversification went beyond sports and included a variety of entertainment events including:
*Classical music events including the London Music Festival in 1947
*Tom Arnold's Harringay [[circus]]
*American [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Billy Graham]] held his first 'Crusade' in the UK at the Arena from 1st March - 12th May 1954. It was the first of 23 'Crusades' and 'Missions' that he held in the UK between 1954 and 1991.

==Decline & Fall==

The change in the fortunes of ice hockey in the UK and the straightened post-war circumstances meant little commercial success for the Arena. in 1958 it was sold to Cavendish Foods and ignominuously used  as a food storage facility for the 20 years until its demolition in 1978. On the site ther is now a small shopping mall.
