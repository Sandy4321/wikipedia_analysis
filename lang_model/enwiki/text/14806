==History==
=== Roots ===
[[File:T<U+014D>dai-ji temple main gate.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The main gate into T<U+014D>dai-ji]]

The beginning of building a temple where the huge T<U+014D>dai-ji complex sits today can be dated to 728, when [[Emperor Sh<U+014D>mu]] established Kinsh<U+014D>sen-ji (<U+91D1><U+9418><U+5C71><U+5BFA>) as an appeasement for [[Prince Motoi]], his first son with his [[Fujiwara clan]] consort [[K<U+014D>my<U+014D>shi]]. Prince Motoi died a year after his birth.

During the [[Tenpy<U+014D>]] era, Japan suffered from a series of disasters and epidemics. It was after experiencing these problems that Emperor Sh<U+014D>mu issued an edict in 741 
to promote the construction of [[provincial temple]]s throughout the nation. T<U+014D>dai-ji (still Kinsh<U+014D>sen-ji at the time) was appointed as the Provincial temple of [[Yamato Province]] and the head of all the provincial temples. With the alleged coup d'<U+00E9>tat by [[Nagaya]] in 729, an outbreak of [[smallpox]] around 735<U+2013>737, worsened by consecutive years of poor crops, then followed by a rebellion led by Fujiwara no Hirotsugu in 740, the country was in a chaotic position. Emperor Sh<U+014D>mu had been forced to move the capital four times, indicating the level of instability during this period.<ref>Hall, John W., ''et al.'', eds. (1988). ''The Cambridge history of Japan,'' pp. 398<U+2013>400.</ref>

===Role in early Japanese Buddhism===

Under the [[Ritsury<U+014D>]] system of government in the [[Nara Period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|S<U+014D>g<U+014D>|<U+50E7><U+7DB1>||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, T<U+014D>dai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples<ref name="abe">{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0231112866 | pages=35, 55}}</ref> for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time: the [[Dharma character school|Hoss<U+014D>]], [[Kegon]], [[Satyasiddhi|J<U+014D>jitsu]], [[Sanlun|Sanron]], [[Ritsu]] and [[Kusha (Buddhism)|Kusha]].  Letters dating from this time also show that all six Buddhist schools had offices at T<U+014D>dai-ji, complete with administrators, shrines and their own library.<ref name="abe" />

[[Image:Todaiji11s3200.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The middle gate to the ''daibutsuden'']]

Japanese Buddhism during this time still maintained the lineage of the [[Vinaya]] and all officially licensed monks had to take their ordination under the Vinaya at T<U+014D>dai-ji.  In 754, ordination was given by [[Ganjin]], who arrived in Japan after overcoming hardships over 12 years and six attempts of crossing the sea from China, to [[Empress K<U+014D>ken]], former [[Emperor Sh<U+014D>mu]] and others.  Later Buddhist monks, including [[K<U+016B>kai]] and [[Saich<U+014D>]] took their ordination here as well.<ref name="Hakeda22">{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = K<U+016B>kai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0231059337 | pages= 35}}</ref>  During K<U+016B>kai's administration of the S<U+014D>g<U+014D>, additional ordination ceremonies were added to T<U+014D>dai-ji, including ordination of the [[Bodhisattva vows|Bodhisattva Precepts]] from the [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahma Net Sutra]] and the esoteric Precepts, or [[Samaya]], from Kukai's own newly established [[Shingon]] school of Buddhism.  Additionally, K<U+016B>kai added an [[Abhiseka]] Hall for the use of initiating monks of the six Nara schools into the esoteric teachings.<ref name="abe" /> by 829.

During its height of power, T<U+014D>dai-ji's famous [[Shuni-e]] ceremony was established by the monk Jitch<U+016B>, and continues to this day.

===Decline===

As the center of power in Japanese Buddhism shifted away from Nara to [[Mount Hiei]] and the [[Tendai]] sect, and later when the capital of Japan moved to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], T<U+014D>dai-ji's role in maintaining authority declined as well.  In later generations, the Vinaya lineage also died out, despite repeated attempts to revive it, thus no more ordination ceremonies take place at T<U+014D>dai-ji.

==Architecture==
===Initial construction===
[[Image:Todaiji shoro.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The belfry]]

In 743, Emperor Sh<U+014D>mu issued a law in which he stated that the people should become directly involved with the establishment of new Buddha temples throughout Japan.  His personal belief was that such piety would inspire Buddha to protect his country from further disaster. [[Gy<U+014D>ki]], with his pupils, traveled the provinces asking for donations. According to records kept by T<U+014D>dai-ji, more than 2,600,000 people in total helped construct the Great Buddha and its Hall.<ref name="official">{{cite web |title=Official T<U+014D>dai-ji Homepage |language=Japanese |url=http://www.todaiji.or.jp/ |accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref><ref>The same record keeps track of some prominent persons, among many others, being involved in the construction. E.g. [[Kuninaka-no-muraji Kimimaro]], whose grandfather was an immigrant from the [[Baekje]] Kingdom on the Korean peninsula, is believed to have directed the construction of the Great Buddha and the Hall. Takechi-no-sanekuni is believed to have directed the sculpture part.</ref> The 16&nbsp;m (52&nbsp;ft)<ref>The height of the original Buddha.</ref> high statue was built through eight castings over three years, the head and neck being cast together as a separate element.<ref>Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979). ''Gukansh<U+014D>,'' p. 286.</ref> The making of the statue was started first in [[Shigaraki, Shiga|Shigaraki]]. After enduring multiple  fires and earthquakes, the construction was eventually resumed in Nara in 745,<ref name="official"/> and the Buddha was finally completed in 751. A year later, in 752, the eye-opening ceremony was held with an attendance of 10,000 people to celebrate the completion of the Buddha. The Indian priest [[Bodhisena]] performed the eye-opening for Emperor Sh<U+014D>mu. The project nearly bankrupted Japan's economy, consuming most of the available [[bronze]] of the time.

The original complex also contained two 100 [[metre|m]] [[pagoda]]s, perhaps second only to the [[pyramids of Egypt]] in height at the time. These were destroyed by earthquake. The [[Sh<U+014D>s<U+014D>in]] was its storehouse, and now contains many artifacts from the Tenpyo period of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]].

===Reconstructions post-Nara Period===
[[Image:T<U+014D>dai-ji Nandaimon.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''Nandaimon'', the Great Southern Gate]]

The Great Buddha Hall (''Daibutsuden'') has been rebuilt twice after fire. The current building was finished in 1709, and although immense<U+2014>57 m long and 50 m wide<U+2014>it is actually 30% smaller than its predecessor. The Great Buddha statue has been [[casting|recast]] several times for various reasons, including [[earthquake]] damage. The current hands of the statue were made in the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period|Momoyama Period]] (1568<U+2013>1615), and the head was made in the [[Edo period]] (1615<U+2013>1867).

The existing Nandaimon (Great South Gate) is a reconstruction of end-12th century based on [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty style]]. The dancing figures of the [[Nio]], the two 28-foot-tall guardians at the Nandaimon, were built at around the same time by [[Unkei]], [[Kaikei]] and their workshop members. The Nio are an ''[[A-un]]'' pair known as ''Ungyo'', which by tradition has a facial expression with a closed mouth, and ''Agyo'', which has an open mouthed expression.<ref>Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (JAANUS), [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/niou.htm "Niou" (<U+4EC1><U+738B>);] [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/a/aun.htm "A un" (<U+963F><U+543D>)], 2001, retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref> The two figures were closely evaluated and extensively restored by a team of art conservators between 1988 and 1993. Until then, these sculptures had never before been moved from the niches in which they were originally installed. This complex preservation project, costing $4.7 million, involved a restoration team of 15 experts from the [[National Treasure Repairing Institute]] in Kyoto.<ref>Sterngold, James. [http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/arts/japan-restores-old-temple-gods.html "Japan Restores Old Temple Gods"]. ''[[The New York Times]].'' December 28, 1991, retrieved 2011-04-14; excerpt, "The Nio are known as Ungyo, which by tradition has a closed mouth, and Agyo, which has an open mouth. The figures, which appear in some form in many Buddhist temples, are powerful bare-chested gods, wielding heavy cudgels to ward off evil spirits. Ungyo was restored first. The more delicate parts were removed, including the long ribbon streaming from its top knot. Then the statue was swathed in thick layers of cotton, laid on its back and rolled slowly to a large metal shed built for the conservation. Ungyo was replaced this year and then Agyo was removed to the shed for restoration, a process that is likely to take two years."</ref>

== Temple precincts and gardens ==
[[Image:IMG 0224 Todaiji.JPG|right|thumb|150px|South Gate utilized in [[Isuien Garden]].]] 
Various buildings of the T<U+014D>dai-ji have been incorporated within the overall aesthetic intention of the gardens' design.  Adjacent villas are today considered part of T<U+014D>dai-ji.  

Some of these structures are now open to the public.  The time spent visiting one or more of these less well-known buildings can only enhance an appreciation of the temple complex itself.  

Over the centuries, the buildings and gardens have evolved together as to become an integral part of a unique, organic and living temple community.
