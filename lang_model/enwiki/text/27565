'''M-311''' is a {{convert|13.600|mi|km|3|adj=on}}  long [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in [[Calhoun County, Michigan|Calhoun County]] in the US state of [[Michigan]] that runs from the intersection of [[M-60 (Michigan highway)|M-60]] in [[Burlington, Michigan|Burlington]] north to [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] at Exit 104 in [[Emmett Charter Township, Michigan|Emmett Township]].  It was previously an [[unsigned highway|unsigned state trunkline]], meaning that no reassurance markers were used to identify the highway.  The route mainly consists of 11 Mile Road, which was a county road prior to the 1998 rationalization process.

==Route description==

M-311 follows 11 Mile Road between M-60 and I-94. In the city of Burlington, M-311 is known as Marshall Street. There is a jog in 11 Mile Road as it runs northwesterly between Q Drive and O Drive. At N Drive, M-311/11 Mile Road turns along N Drive a short distance before turning back northward. Near D Drive, 11 Mile Road passes  Hyde Lake. M-311 crosses the [[Kalamazoo River]] just south of I-94. All of M-311 is two-lane, rural highway in forest lands and farm fields,<ref name=google>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=W+Leroy+St+%26+N+Marshall+St,+Burlington,+MI+49029&daddr=11+Mile+Rd%2FWheatfield+Rd&hl=en&geocode=FRZ_ggIdEcjt-ikzB3f8E90XiDFBANg0DQZE0w%3BFXxvhQId7MHt-g&mra=ls&sll=42.278833,-85.086365&sspn=0.120023,0.128231&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=12 |title=Overview map of M-311 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name=MDOT10/> and none of it is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref name="NHS">{{cite map | title=National Highway System, Michigan | date=April 23, 2006 | publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation | url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf | format=PDF|accessdate=October 7, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
M-311 was created on October 1, 1998 as a part of Governor [[John Engler]]'s Rationalization process. The original routing started at [[Interstate 94 Business (Battle Creek, Michigan)|BL I-94]]/Michigan Avenue and Raymond Avenue. It followed Raymond Avenue to Emmet Street before turning east to Cooper Avenue. From Cooper Avenue, M-311 turned east again on N Drive North until meeting 11 Mile Road. There it followed 11 Mile Road south to M-60 in Burlington.<ref name=mpr/> Since the original transfer, all of M-311 north of I-94 was returned to Calhoun County control. This eliminated the section that made a "U-turn". Since December 2009, the highway has been signed in the field.<ref name="MDOT10">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2010 |scale= 1 in.:15 mi/1 cm:9 km |section=}}</ref>
