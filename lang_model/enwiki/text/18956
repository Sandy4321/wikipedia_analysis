'''Balthasar Klossowski''' (or '''K<U+0142>ossowski''') '''de Rola''' (February 29, 1908 in Paris &ndash; February 18, 2001 in [[Rossini<U+00E8>re]], Switzerland), best known as '''Balthus''', was an esteemed but controversial Polish-French [[modern art]]ist.

Throughout his career, Balthus rejected the usual conventions of the art world. He insisted that his paintings should be seen and not read about, and he resisted any attempts made to build a biographical profile. A telegram sent to the [[Tate]] Gallery as it prepared for its 1968 retrospective of his works read:<small> "NO BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. BEGIN: BALTHUS IS A PAINTER OF WHOM NOTHING IS KNOWN. NOW LET US LOOK AT THE PICTURES. REGARDS. B."</small><ref>Klossowski de Rola, 18</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years===
In his formative years his art was sponsored by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Maurice Denis]],
[[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Pierre Matisse]]. His father, [[Erich Klossowski]], a noted art historian who wrote a monograph on [[Honor<U+00E9> Daumier|Daumier]], and his mother Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro (known as the painter [[Baladine Klossowska]]) were part of the cultural elite in Paris. Balthus's older brother, [[Pierre Klossowski]], was a philosopher and writer influenced by [[theology]] and the works of the [[Marquis de Sade]]. Among the visitors and friends of the Klossowskis were famous writers such as [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], who found some inspiration for his novel ''[[Les Enfants Terribles]]'' (1929) in his visits to the family.

In 1921 ''Mitsou'', a book which included forty drawings by Balthus, was published. It depicted the story of a young boy and his [[cat]], with a preface by Balthus's mentor, the [[Bohemia|Bohemian]]-[[Austrian people|Austrian]] poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875-1926) who at the time was his mother's lover. The theme of the story foreshadowed his lifelong fascination with cats, which resurfaced with his self-portrait as ''The King of Cats'' (1935). In 1926 he visited [[Florence]], copying [[fresco]]s by [[Piero della Francesca]], which inspired another early ambitious work by the young painter: the [[tempera]] wall paintings of the Protestant church of the Swiss village of [[Beatenberg]] (1927). From 1930 to 1932 he lived in [[Morocco]], was drafted into the Moroccan infantry in [[Kenitra]] and [[Fes]], worked as a secretary, and sketched his painting ''La Caserne'' (1933).

===A young artist in Paris===
Moving in 1933 into his first Paris studio at the ''Rue de Furstemberg'' and later another at the ''Cour de Rohan'', Balthus showed no interest in [[modernist]] styles such as [[Cubism]]. His paintings often depicted pubescent young girls in erotic and voyeuristic poses. One of the most notorious works from his first exhibition in Paris was ''The Guitar Lesson'' (1934), which caused controversy due to its sexually explicit depiction of a girl arched on her back over the lap of her female teacher, whose hands are positioned on the girl as for playing the guitar: one near her exposed crotch, another grasping her hair. Other important works from the same exhibition included ''[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80582 La Rue]'' (1933), ''[http://images.artnet.com/images_US/magazine/news/bradley/bradley9-7-07-10.jpg La Toilette de Cathy]'' (1933) and ''[http://squarewhiteworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Alice-@-5001.jpg Alice dans le miroir]'' (1933).<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n9_v85/ai_19785378 ''Balthus lessons - five controversial works by the French artist'' Art in America,  Sept, 1997  by Sabine Rewald]</ref>

In 1937 he married Antoinette de Watteville, who was from an old and influential aristocratic family from [[Bern]]. He had met her as early as 1924, and she was the model for the aforementioned ''La Toilette'' and for a series of portraits. Balthus had two children from this marriage, Thaddeus and Stanislas (Stash) Klossowski, who recently published books on their father, including the letters by their parents.

Early on his work was admired by writers and fellow painters, especially by [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. His circle of friends in Paris included the novelists [[Pierre Jean Jouve]], [[Antoine de Saint-Exup<U+00E9>ry]], [[Joseph Breitbach]], [[Pierre Leyris]], [[Henri Michaux]], [[Michel Leiris]] and [[Ren<U+00E9> Char]], the photographer [[Man Ray]], the playwright and actor [[Antonin Artaud]], and the painters [[Andr<U+00E9> Derain]], [[Joan Mir<U+00F3>]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]] (one of the most faithful of his friends). In 1948, another friend, [[Albert Camus]], asked him to design the sets and costumes for his play ''L'Etat de Si<U+00E8>ge'' (''[[The State of Siege]]'', directed by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]]). Balthus also designed the sets and costumes for Artaud's adaptation for [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s [[The Cenci]] (1935), [[Ugo Betti]]'s ''Delitto all'isola delle capre'' (Crime on Goat-Island, 1953) and Barrault's adaptation of [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]] (1959<U+2013>1960).

===Champrovent to Chassy===
In 1940, with the invasion of France by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, Balthus fled with his wife Antoinette to [[Savoy]] to a farm in [[Champrovent]] near [[Aix-les-Bains]], where he began work on two major paintings: ''Landscape near Champrovent'' (1942<U+2013>1945) and ''The Living Room'' (1942). In 1942, he escaped from Nazi France to Switzerland, first to [[Bern]] and in 1945 to [[Geneva]], where he made friends with the publisher [[Albert Skira]] as well as the writer and member of the [[French Resistance]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Malraux]]. Balthus returned to France in 1946 and a year later traveled with [[Andr<U+00E9> Masson]] to [[Southern France]], meeting figures such as Picasso and [[Jacques Lacan]], who eventually became a collector of his work. With [[Adolphe Mouron Cassandre]] in 1950, Balthus designed stage decor for a production of [[Mozart]]'s opera [[Cos<U+00EC> fan tutte]] in [[Aix-en-Provence]]. Three years later he moved into the Chateau de Chassy in the [[Morvan]], living with his niece Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>rique Tison and finishing his large-scale masterpieces ''La Chambre'' (''The Room'' 1952, possibly influenced by [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s novels) and ''Le Passage du Commerce Saint-Andr<U+00E9>'' (1954).

===Later years===
As international fame grew with exhibitions in the gallery of [[Pierre Matisse]] (1938) and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (1956) in New York City, he cultivated the image of himself as an enigma. In 1964, he moved to Rome where he presided over the [[Villa de Medici]] as director (appointed by the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[Andr<U+00E9> Malraux]]) of the [[French Academy in Rome]], and made friends with the filmmaker [[Federico Fellini]] and the painter [[Renato Guttuso]].

In 1977 he moved to [[Rossini<U+00E8>re]], Switzerland. That he had a second, Japanese wife Setsuko Ideta whom he married in 1967 and was thirty-five years his junior, simply added to the air of mystery around him (he met her in Japan, during a diplomatic mission also initiated by [[Malraux]]). A son, Fumio, was born in 1968 but died two years later.

The photographers and friends [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Martine Franck]] (Cartier-Bresson's wife), both portrayed the painter and his wife and their daughter Harumi (born 1973) in his [[Grand Chalet]] in Rossini<U+00E8>re in 1999.

Balthus was one of the few living artists to be represented in the [[Louvre]], when his painting ''The Children'' (1937) was acquired from the private collection of [[Pablo Picasso]].<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/19/local/me-27401 LAtimes.com] Los Angeles Times 19 February 2001</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/reunionfrance/1323280/Controversial-Balthus-dies-aged-92.html Telegraph.co.uk] Telegraph.co.uk 19 Jun 2001</ref> 

[[Prime Minister]]s and rock stars alike attended the funeral of Balthus. [[Bono]], lead-singer of [[U2]], sang for the hundreds of mourners at the funeral, including the President of France, the [[Prince Sadruddhin Aga Khan]], [[supermodel]] [[Elle Macpherson]], and Cartier-Bresson.

===Style and themes===
Balthus's style is primarily classical. His work shows numerous influences, including the writings of [[Emily Bront<U+00EB>]], the writings and photography of [[Lewis Carroll]], and the paintings of [[Tommaso Masaccio|Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Simone Martini]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Jean Etienne Liotard]], [[Joseph Reinhardt]], [[Th<U+00E9>odore G<U+00E9>ricault|G<U+00E9>ricault]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[F<U+00E9>lix Vallotton]] and [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne]]. Although his technique and compositions were inspired by pre-[[renaissance]] painters, there also are eerie intimations of contemporary [[surrealists]] like [[de Chirico]]. Painting the figure at a time when figurative art was largely ignored, he is widely recognised as an important 20th century artist.

Many of his paintings show young girls in an erotic context. Balthus insisted that his work was not erotic but that it recognized the discomforting facts of children's sexuality.

===Ancestral debates===
Balthus's father, Erich, was born to a noble Polish family ([[szlachta]]) of the [[Rola coat of arms]], that lived in [[Prussia]]. This was evidently the reason for his son Balthus, to add, later, "de Rola" to his family name [[Klossowski]], which was in szlachta tradition (if he had lived in Poland, the arrangement of his last name would have been '''Rola-K<U+0142>ossowski''' or '''K<U+0142>ossowski h. Rola'''.) The artist was very conscious of his Polish ancestry and the [[Rola]] arms was embroidered onto many of his kimono, in the style of Japanese [[kamon]].

According to most biographies, Balthus denied having any ethnic Jewish heritage, claiming that biographers had confused his mother's true ancestry. In ''Balthus: A Biography'', [[Nicholas Fox Weber]], who is Jewish, attempts to find common ground while interviewing the painter by bringing up a biographical note stating that his mother was Jewish. Balthus replied, "No, sir, that is incorrect," and explained: "One of my father's best friends was a painter called [[Eugen Spiro]], who was the son of a [[Hazzan|cantor]]. My mother was also called Spiro, but came apparently from a Protestant family in the south of France. One of the Midi Spiros - one of the ancestors - went to Russia. They were likely of Greek origin. We called Eugen Spiro "Uncle" because of the close relationship, but he was not my real uncle. The Protestant Spiros are still in the south of France."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} 

Balthus continued by saying he did not think it was tasteful to forcefully correct these errors, given his many Jewish friends. Nicholas Fox Weber concludes in his biography that Balthus was lying about this "biographical error," though the exact reasoning behind this was never explained. Weber states that the name "Spiro" is only a Greek given name, though this is incorrect, as the personal name serves equally as a surname.<ref>[http://surnames.behindthename.com/php/browse.php?letter=s Behind the Name: S<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Balthus consistently repeated that if he, in fact, was Jewish, he would have no problem with it. In support of Weber's view, Balthus did make dubious claims about his ancestry before, once claiming he was descended from [[Lord Byron]] on his father's side.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} 

According to Weber, Balthus would frequently add to the story of his mother's ancestry, saying that she was also related to the [[Romanov]], Narischkin, and lesser known Raginet families among others, though conceding Balthus never claimed his mother's side was from a straight unmixed lineage. Despite the sensationalism with which Weber says he told these stories and the method in which Weber presents Balthus's claims, Balthus never saw himself as contradictory. The true extent of what Balthus was saying for artistic effect and what he was saying in earnest is unknown as he did not stick seriously to all his claims. Weber never interviewed Pierre Klossowski, the painter's brother, in order to confirm or deny their mother's ancestry. Weber did, however, present a quote by Baladine's lover, the poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], in which Rilke states that the Spiros were descended from one of the richest [[Sephardic]]-Spanish families. In a seemingly conclusionary note, Weber writes: "The artist neglected, however, to tell me that, in the most miserable of ironies, Fumio (Balthus's son) suffered from [[Tay-Sachs]] disease." {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Weber holds this up as evidence that Balthus was lying about not having Jewish ancestry, given Tay-Sachs is a heavily [[Ashkenazic]]-Jewish disease. This, of course, conflicts with Rilke's report of the Spiros being Sephardic, which Weber later says was a "Rilke embellishment" and also brings up the relevance of the preponderance of Japanese infantile Tay-Sachs, since Balthus's wife was Japanese.

==Influence and legacy==

His work has strongly influenced several contemporary artists; among them [[Jan Saudek]], [[Will Barnet]], [[Duane Michals]], [[John Currin]], and [[Emile Chambon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

He has also influenced the filmmaker [[Jacques Rivette]] of the [[French New Wave]], whose film ''[[Hurlevent]]'' (1985) was inspired by Balthus's drawings made at the beginning of the 1930s: "Seeing as he's a bit of an eccentric and all that, I am very fond of Balthus (...) I was struck by the fact that Balthus enormously simplified the costumes and stripped away the imagery trappings (...)".<ref>[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/29/hurlevent/ Interview with Valerie Hazette]</ref>

A reproduction of Balthus's ''Girl at a Window'' (a painting from 1957) prominently appears in [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]]'s film ''Domicile Conjugal'' (''[[Bed and Board (1970 film)|Bed & Board]]'', 1970). The two principal characters, Antoine Doinel ([[Jean-Pierre L<U+00E9>aud]]) and his wife Christine ([[Claude Jade]]), are arguing. Christine takes down from the wall a small drawing of about 25<U+00D7>25&nbsp;cm and gives it to her husband: Christine: "Here, take the small Balthus." Antoine: "Ah, the small Balthus. I offered it to you, it's yours, keep it."

[[Harold Budd]]'s album ''[[The White Arcades]]'' includes a track titled "Balthus Bemused by Color."

[[Robert Dassanowsky]]'s book ''Telegrams from the Metropole: Selected Poems 1980-1998'' includes "The Balthus Poem."

South African novelist [[Christopher Hope]] wrote ''My Chocolate Redeemer'' around a painting by Balthus, ''The Golden Days'' (1944), which appears on the book jacket.

[[Stephen Dobyns]]' book ''The Balthus Poems''  (Atheneum, 1982) describes individual paintings by Balthus in 32 narrative poems.

His widow, [[Setsuko Klossowska de Rola]], heads the Balthus Foundation established in 1998.
