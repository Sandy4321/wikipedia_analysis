==Career==
===Music===
====Boyzone====
{{details|Boyzone}}

Gately joined [[Boyzone]] upon their formation in 1993. The group became known in Ireland after an infamous appearance on ''[[The Late Late Show]]'' that year, which presenter [[Gay Byrne]] dismissed&mdash;although he later concluded: "They certainly had the last laugh on us".<ref name="Stephen never gave up dream of one last tour with Boyzone">{{cite web|author=Richie Taylor|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/stephen-never-gave-up-dream-of-one-last-tour-with-boyzone-1910815.html|title=Stephen never gave up dream of one last tour with Boyzone|date=2009-10-12|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> Boyzone's first success outside Ireland was when the song "[[Love Me for a Reason]]" reached number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1995.<ref name="Mystery surrounds death of Boyzone pin-up Gately"/> The group split suddenly following a string of performances in Dublin's [[Point Theatre]] in 2000.<ref name="Stephen never gave up dream of one last tour with Boyzone"/> By the time Boyzone originally rested the band, they had achieved six number ones on the UK Singles Chart. They were considered a major pop band of the 1990s and had a much publicised rivalry with UK boy band [[Take That]],<ref name="Mystery surrounds death of Boyzone pin-up Gately"/> even selling more singles than them.<ref name="Boyzone star Stephen Gately dies"/> Gately shared the majority of lead vocal work with [[Ronan Keating]].

A February appearance at the [[2008 Meteor Awards]] relaunched the reformed Boyzone, with touring taking place throughout 2008.<ref>{{cite news | title = Meteor Music Awards Press Release |  url = http://meteormusicawards.meteor.ie/page1770436.aspx | date = [[28 January]] [[2008]] | accessdate = 2008-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/sinead-cuts-loose-with-new-band-1271809.html|title=Sinead cuts Loose with new band<U+2026>|date=2008-01-23|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> After his death, manager Louis Walsh described Gately as "the glue in Boyzone, he kept them all together".<ref name="Louis Walsh to miss X Factor as Stephen Gately's funeral confirmed for Saturday"/>

====Solo career====
After success with Boyzone, the band decided in 2000 to move on to solo projects. Gately was the first with his debut solo single titled "New Beginning" and later a debut solo album of the same name. 

The album ''New Beginning'' included twelve brand new tracks including a version of the classic "[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]" which he recorded for the soundtrack to the new TV version of ''[[Watership Down]]''. He also became the voice of one of the characters ('Blackavar') which was created to look like him.

On 29 May 2000, the single "New Beginning" was released and reached number three in the UK charts. Two weeks later the album was released and also entered the charts.

The second single taken from the album was "I Believe". Released on 2 October 2000 this song also featured on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' and just missed the UK top ten, peaking at number eleven. Gately was inspired to record this track after he had seen the film. He attended the premieres of the film both at the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]] and at the Empire Theatre in [[Leicester Square]], along with the actors from the film including [[Julie Walters]] and [[Jamie Bell]]. In May 2001, Stephen's third single, "Stay", was released and reached number thirteen in the UK chart. That month, with his single still in the charts, his record company [[Polydor]] dropped him from their label. 

In January 2007, Gately was heard in ''[[Horror of Glam Rock]]'', a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[audio theatre|audio drama]] produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] for [[BBC7]]. For this audio play, Gately recorded an original song, "Children of Tomorrow", with music by Tim Sutton and lyrics by [[Barnaby Edwards]]; this was his first solo track since 2001's "Stay".<ref>{{cite press release | title =Boyzone singer makes Doctor Who debut on BBC 7 and records first solo song for five years | publisher =[[BBC]] | date =[[2006-10-20]] | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/10_october/20/gately.shtml | accessdate = 2006-10-20  }}</ref>

====Boyzone's reformation====
In 2008 following his solo career and various bouts of acting and television appearances, Gately rejoined his old colleagues when Boyzone reformed, following the success of revived contemporaries [[Take That]]. Gately had been the most eager to reform and urged his bandmates to come together again.<ref name="Stephen never gave up dream of one last tour with Boyzone"/> They sold out two more tours of the United Kingdom.<ref name="Boyzone singer Gately dies aged 33">{{cite web|author=Tom Peck|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/boyzone-singer-gately-dies-aged-33-1801296.html|title=Boyzone singer Gately dies aged 33|date=2009-10-11|accessdate=2009-10-11|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''}}</ref>

Boyzone released a brand new single, "[[Love You Anyway]]", followed by a [[Back Again... No Matter What|new compilation album]] in October 2008. December 2008 saw the release of a second new single, "[[Better (Tom Baxter song)#Boyzone_cover|Better]]". The video for the song generated controversy, as scenes depicting romantic couples included a shot of two men embracing, in an inclusive nod to Gately's homosexuality. The group unanimously agreed that Gately should be allowed pair with a male actor.<ref name="First gay couple in boyband video ">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/entertainment/newsid_7724000/7724426.stm|title=First gay couple in boyband video|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> It was condemned by, among others, the minister of the [[Dromore, County Down|Dromore]] [[Reformed Presbyterian Church]].<ref>[http://gay.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9636.html Boyzone's "deadly message" of gay equality upsets Presbyterian minister]</ref> Others, however, cite that milestone as among the reasons why Gately is a "gay rights hero". Wrote Tim Teeman of the ''Times Online'', "Gately showed that an unflamboyant guy could be a pop star and gay...the real shame should be reserved for those managers and showbusiness power-brokers who practise that kind of discrimination, and also maintain the closet, to line their pockets."<ref> {{cite web |author=Tim Teeman |title= No marching or shouting but Stephen Gately was a gay rights hero |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6870093.ece |work= Commentary |publisher=Times Online |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref>

At the time of Gately's death the group had selected thirty songs which they intended to record for a new album to be released in 2010.<ref name="Future remains unclear as Boyz cope with loss">{{cite web|author=Richie Taylor|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/future-remains-unclear-as-boyz-cope-with-loss-1914201.html|title=Future remains unclear as Boyz cope with loss|date=2009-10-15|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> This was to have been followed by a tour.<ref name="Future remains unclear as Boyz cope with loss"/>

===Acting and television===
In December 2002, Gately took the lead role in [[Bill Kenwright]]'s new production of [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'',<ref name="Stephen never gave up dream of one last tour with Boyzone"/> which previewed in Oxford in December 2002 before moving to Liverpool over Christmas 2002 and finally to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] and the New London Theatre in [[Drury Lane]] in February 2003. From September 2004 until March 2005 Gately played the [[Child Catcher]] in ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' at the [[London Palladium]].

Gately made his [[pantomime]] debut at the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]] in December 2005 starring as Dandini in ''[[Cinderella#Adaptations|Cinderella]]''. In April 2006 he took on the role of [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' at the Marlowe Theatre, [[Canterbury]].

Gately also took part in Channel Five's ''All Star Talent Show'' in October 2006, performing the slice and dice magic trick which he only had a week to learn, coming second to [[Toby Anstis]]. He was also in the second series of ITV's ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' with his dancing partner [[Kristina Lenko]]. They went out in eighth place on 10 February 2007. 

In March 2007, Gately provided his vocal talents to the [[Big Finish Productions]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio play, ''[[Horror of Glam Rock]]''.

In September 2007, Gately began touring the UK in an 11-week run of [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s rock musical ''[[Godspell]]'', but withdrew from the production after just three weeks for contractual reasons.<ref>{{cite press release | title =Godspell Annoucement| publisher =[[seatwave]] | date =[[2007-10-03]] | url =http://godspell.seatwaveblogs.com/2007/10/announcement.php| accessdate = 2007-10-03  }}</ref>

In 2008, Gately appeared in the independent horror film, ''[[Credo (film)|Credo]]'' which was released in the United States as ''Devil's Curse''.

===Philanthropy===
Gately was a vice patron of the charity [[Missing People]] (formerly National Missing Persons Helpline), supporting their Runaway Helpline service for young people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.missingpeople.org.uk/about/patrons/ |title=Missing People - Our Patrons |accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> He was an ambassador for the Caudwell Children Charity in [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke]] and on one occasion gave a private Christmas performance, raising thousands of pounds.<ref name="Thousands Donated In Memory Of Stephen Gately"/> The Gately family requested that donations be given to the charity instead of flowers sent to them after his death in 2009.<ref name="Thousands Donated In Memory Of Stephen Gately"/> This in turn raised thousands more pounds.<ref name="Thousands Donated In Memory Of Stephen Gately"/>

===Radio===
''[[The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show]]'' on Irish radio station [[RT<U+00C9> 2fm]] has featured sketches involving Gately and Boyzone bandmate Ronan Keating. One such sketch which aired in May 2009 received complaints for its use of "foul and offensive language" at 8:55 am.<ref name="Boyzone gag gets RTE the rap for waxing lyrical on show"/><ref name="RT<U+00C9> 2FM censured over foul language in Boyzone sketch"/><ref name="The O-Zone: 18/08/2009"/> The sketch included Keating requesting advice from Gately on how to cope with itchiness of the [[groin]] he had contracted after [[waxing]] and a plan for the pair to assault their bandmate Mikey Graham with the help of a [[snooker]] [[Cue stick|cue]].<ref name="Boyzone gag gets RTE the rap for waxing lyrical on show">{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/boyzone-gag-gets-rte-the-rap-for-waxing-lyrical-on-show-1856261.html|title=Boyzone gag gets RTE the rap for waxing lyrical on show|date=2009-08-11|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=''[[Evening Herald]]''}}</ref><ref name="RT<U+00C9> 2FM censured over foul language in Boyzone sketch">{{cite web|author=Kilian Doyle|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0811/1224252370613.html|title=RT<U+00C9> 2FM censured over foul language in Boyzone sketch|date=2009-08-11|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}</ref><ref name="The O-Zone: 18/08/2009">{{cite web|author=[[Olaf Tyaransen]]|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/the-ozone-18082009-1862637.html|title=The O-Zone: 18/08/2009|date=2009-08-18|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=''[[Evening Herald]]''}}</ref>

===Writing===
During the three years prior to his death, Gately had been writing a children's fantasy novel called ''The Tree of Seasons''.  In an April 2009 interview with the [[Press Association]] he declared that he was nearly finished, had publisher interest, and hoped for a Christmas 2009 release.<ref> {{cite web |url= http://news.uk.msn.com/entertainment/article.aspx?cp-documentid=15903024&imageindex=7 |title= Gately: Ghost-writing is cheating  |accessdate=2009-10-01 |publisher=Press Association |date= 2009-04-09 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Gately split from his first boyfriend, Stephen Howard, in 1993. Howard became a heroin addict and in 1995 committed suicide by hanging.<ref name="Telegraph obituary"/> 

On 16 June 1999, ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' newspaper covered its front page with what it described as a "World Exclusive" and the headline, "Boyzone Stephen: I'm gay and I'm in love".<ref name=bbc1>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/370073.stm |title=Fans back Boyzone's Stephen  |accessdate=2008-09-25 |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-06-16 }}</ref> At the age of 23, Gately sold his story to the newspaper because he feared a former member of Boyzone's security was about to sell the story. ''The Sun'' had two further pages on the story as well as an editorial. Gately also revealed that in 1998 he had started a relationship with the then 27 year-old Eloy de Jong, who had been in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] boy band [[Caught in the Act (boy band)|Caught in the Act]].<ref name=bbc1/> They had first met in 1995.
