The '''''Mahan''-class destroyers''' of the [[United States Navy]] were 18 [[destroyer]]s commissioned in 1936 and 1937. Two of these, [[USS Dunlap (DD-384)|''Dunlap'']] and [[USS Fanning (DD-385)|''Fanning'']], are sometimes considered as a separate  [[ship class]]. {{USS|Mahan|DD-364|2}} was the [[lead ship]], named for Rear Admiral [[Alfred T. Mahan]], an influential historian and theorist on sea power.

The ''Mahan''s featured improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 [[torpedo tubes]], superimposed gun shelters, and generators for emergency use. [[Ship displacement]] increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class introduced a new steam [[propulsion]] system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight [[steam turbine]], proving simpler and more efficient than the ''Mahan''s' predecessors<U+2014>so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.

All 18 ships saw action in [[World War II]], entirely in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]], including during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], and the battles of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]], [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]], and [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]]. Their participation in major and secondary campaigns included the bombardment of beachheads, amphibious landings, task force screening, convoy and patrol duty, and anti-aircraft and submarine warfare.  Six ships were lost in combat and two were expended in the postwar [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests. The remainder were decommissioned, sold, or scrapped after the war; none remain today. Collectively, the ships received 111 [[battle stars]] for their World War II service.

==Design==

The ''Mahan''-class destroyers emerged as improved versions of the [[Farragut-class destroyer (1934)|''Farragut''s]],<ref name="Reilly p. 28">Reilly p. 28</ref> which were themselves considered second only to the Japanese {{sclass-|Fubuki|destroyer|0}} destroyers. The Navy's [[General Board]] had been wrestling with proposed design changes, first considering 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer [[5"/38 caliber gun]],<ref name="Friedman-p86">Friedman p. 86</ref> and then proposing to retain all five guns with the 12 torpedo tubes, but configuring those guns only for surface targets, not air targets. The [[Chief of Naval Operations]] objected, recommending against "subordinating the gun to the [[torpedo]]", and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the ''Mahan'' class and others.<ref>Friedman pp. 87 & 88</ref> In the final design, No. 3 gun was moved to the aft deckhouse (just ahead of No. 4)  to make room for the third quadruple torpedo tube; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides, releasing the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse.  All five 5"/38s were kept and remained [[dual purpose gun]]s, able to target aircraft as well as ships,  but only No. 1 and No. 2 had [[gun shield]]s. The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land-based machinery.  This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient to operate. These changes led to a ten percent increase in displacement over the ''Farragut''s.{{efn|The ''Mahan''s displaced {{convert|1500|LT}} compared to {{convert|1365|LT}} for the ''Farragut''s.<ref name="Friedman p. 88"/>}}<ref name="Friedman p. 88">Friedman p. 88</ref>

The ''Mahan''s typically had a tripod foremast with a pole mainmast.<ref name="Reilly p. 28"/> To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging.<ref name="Friedman p. 88"/> In silhouette, they were similar to the larger {{sclass-|Porter|destroyer|1}}s that immediately preceded them.<ref name="Reilly-p28">Reilly  p. 28</ref> The ''Mahan''s were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.<ref name="Friedman p. 88"/>

The ''Mahan''s displaced {{convert|1500|LT|t|0}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The [[length overall|overall length]] of the class was {{convert|341|ft|3|in|m|1}}, the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and the [[draft (hull)|draft]] {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. They were powered by [[General Electric]] geared steam turbines, driving two shafts that developed a total of {{convert|46000|shp|lk=in}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}. Four [[Babcock and Wilcox]] or four [[Foster Wheeler]] [[water-tube boiler]]s generated the superheated steam needed for the turbines. The ''Mahan''s carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a range of {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. Their peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men.<ref name="Friedman p. 465">Friedman p. 465</ref> The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Roscoe p. 20</ref>

==Armament==
[[File:USS Mahan 24 June 1944.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Mahan|DD-364|6}} at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul on 24 June 1944]]
The main battery of the ''Mahan'' class consisted of five dual purpose 5"/38 caliber guns, equipped with the Mark 33 gun [[fire control system]].<ref name="Friedman p. 88" /><ref name="Friedman p. 465"/> The [[anti-aircraft]] battery had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s.<ref>Hodges and Friedman p. 111</ref> The class was fitted with three quadruple torpedo tube mounts for twelve [[Mark 15 torpedo|21 inch]] [[torpedo tubes]], guided by the Mark 27 torpedo fire control system.<ref name="Friedman p. 465"/> Depth charge roll-off racks were rigged on the stern.<ref name="Friedman-p86" />

In early 1942, the ''Mahan''-class destroyers began a wartime armament refitting process, but most of the class was not fully refitted until 1944.<ref name="Hodges & Friedman p. 145">Hodges & Friedman p. 145</ref> The notable refits to the ''Mahan'' class included the removal of one 5"/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin [[Bofors 40 mm guns]] and between four and six [[20 mm Oerlikon]] guns.<ref name="Hodges & Friedman p. 145"/><ref>Reilly p. 73</ref>

In January 1945, removal of two quadruple torpedo tubes was authorized to permit substitution of two 40&nbsp;mm quad mounts. In June, removal of the third centerline tube was authorized to make way for two 40&nbsp;mm twin mounts abreast of the aft stack. All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have directors installed with their new 40&nbsp;mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with [[radar]].<ref>Reilly p. 75</ref>

==''Dunlap'' class==
The ''Dunlap'' class was a two-ship destroyer class based on the ''Mahan'' design, though some sources do not consider them as separate. Unlike the ''Mahan''s, the ''Dunlap''s had base rings housing projectile hoists that rotated with each of the forward 5"/38 caliber guns.<ref>McComb p. 11</ref> ''Dunlap'' and ''Fanning'' were the first US destroyers to use enclosed forward gun mounts rather than shields; their light pole foremast and lack of a mainmast visibly distinguished them from the ''Mahan''s.<ref>Reilly p. 35</ref>

==Construction==
Contracts for the first six ''Mahan''s were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house design structure.  On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of [[Gibbs and Cox]] was named as the design agent.<ref name="Reilly p. 28"/> The firm had no experience in the design of warships,  but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy.<ref>McComb p. 9</ref> The decision was made to design the ''Mahan'' class and future classes around a new generation of machinery,<ref>Reilly pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref> including a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system that combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and double reduction gears.<ref name="Friedman p. 88">Friedman p. 88</ref>

==Service history==

===''Mahan''===
{{main|USS Mahan (DD-364)}}
USS ''Mahan'' was commissioned on the east coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937. She sailed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before moving on to Pearl Harbor. At sea when the Japanese [[attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, ''Mahan'' participated in the initial post-attack efforts in search of the strike force.<ref name=DANFS_Mahan/> The ship joined [[Task Force 17]] in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the [[Marshall Islands|Marshall]] and [[Gilbert Islands]].<ref>Rohwer & Hummelchen p. 119</ref> Late in March, she returned to Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul. By August 1942, ''Mahan'' was back operating out of Pearl Harbor.<ref name=DANFS_Mahan/>

[[File:BB South Dakota.jpg|thumb|''South Dakota'', Navy repair ship, ''Mahan'', and ''Lampson'', after ''South Dakota'' <U+2013> ''Mahan'' collision, following the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]]
In October 1942, ''Mahan'' was assigned to [[Task Force 61]] and took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. The engagement cost the Navy 74 aircraft, the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, and one destroyer.  While en route to [[Noumea, New Caledonia]], ''Mahan'' and the battleship {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} collided, causing severe damage to both ships.<ref name="Roscoe p 185 188">Roscoe pp. 185<U+2013>188</ref>  Temporary repairs were made to ''Mahan'' and she steamed to Pearl Harbor for a new bow.  She pulled out of Pearl Harbor in January 1943. In the months to follow, ''Mahan'' escorted convoys between [[New Hebrides]] and the [[Fiji Islands]], performed patrol assignments off New Caledonia and engaged in operations in [[Australian]] waters.<ref name=DANFS_Mahan/> Assigned to the amphibious force of Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]], ''Mahan'' participated in a succession of,wide-ranging amphibious campaigns in [[New Guinea]] and [[New Britain]].<ref>Roscoe pp. 256<U+2013>259 & 267<U+2013>269</ref>  In February and March 1944, she saw action with the [[7th Fleet]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]].<ref>Roscoe pp. 404<U+2013>405</ref> After that the ship was ordered  back to the west coast for an overhaul, leaving the yard in July 1944 for Pearl Harbor.<ref name=DANFS_Mahan/>

Returning to New Guinea, ''Mahan'' began to escort convoys between Hollandia [[Jayapura]] and [[Leyte]] in the [[Philippine Islands]]. By November 1944, she was doing anti-submarine patrols off Leyte. On 7 December 1944 while patrolling the channel between Leyte and [[Ponson Island]], a group of Japanese suicide aircraft overwhelmed ''Mahan'' at [[Ormoc Bay]].  She was disabled by the attack, then abandoned and sunk by a US destroyer. ''Mahan'' received five battle stars for her World War II service.<ref name=DANFS_Mahan/>

===''Cummings''===
{{Main|USS Cummings (DD-365)}}
[[File:Cummings in the Pacific.jpg|thumb|''Cummings'' underway in 1944]]
USS ''Cummings'' served in the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in the late 1930s, participating in numerous individual and fleet training exercises. In 1940, she served on security patrols off the west coast. ''Cummings'' went on a goodwill visit to several ports in the South Pacific, including [[Auckland, New Zealand]], and [[Tahiti]]. The destroyer was hit by fragments while docked in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, and suffered a few casualties. She escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and the west coast for the first six months of  World War II. In June 1942, she was transferred to convoy escort duties in the South Pacific until August, when she had an overhaul in San Francisco, and then returned to her role as a convoy escort in the South Pacific.<ref name=DANFS_cummings>{{cite web|title=Cummings|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c16/cummings-ii.htm|publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]]|accessdate=26 May 2013|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships}}</ref>

In January 1944, ''Cummings'' joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Strike Force while it raided Japanese positions in the Central Pacific.<ref name="Rohwer p. 303">Rohwer p. 303</ref>  In March, ''Cummings'' sailed for [[Trincomalee]], Ceylon, where she rendezvoused with British ships for exercises. In April, the ship joined a British force to screen during air strikes on [[Sabang, Indonesia]]. She returned to Ceylon in May and then moved on to [[Exmouth Gulf]], Australia. With a British force, ''Cummings'' sortied for air strikes on [[Soerabaja]], Java, before leaving for Pearl Harbor.<ref name=DANFS_Cummings/>

By July she was back in San Francisco to escort the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Baltimore|CA-68|2}}, the ship that carried President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to Pearl Harbor.<ref>Rohwer p. 344</ref> ''Cummings'' joined the  [[US 3rd Fleet]] for the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944.<ref name=DANFS_Cummings/>  The next month, she bombarded Iwo Jima in preparation for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|amphibious assault on the island]].<ref name="Rohwer p. 384">Rohwer p. 384</ref> The ship operated off Okinawa [[Battle of Okinawa| during its invasion]].<ref>Rohwer p. 404</ref> After the war, ''Cummings'' returned to the United States and was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1947. She received seven battle stars for her World War II service.<ref name=DANFS_Cummings/>

===''Drayton''===
{{main|USS Drayton (DD-366)}}
[[File:USSDraytonDD366.jpg|thumb|''Drayton'' underway in 1936|left]]
USS ''Drayton'' made her shakedown cruise to Europe late in 1936, and finished her final trials in the United States.  She left Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, to join the Scouting Force.  In July, ''Drayton'' participated in the search for the lost American pilot, [[Amelia Earhart]].

She moved on to San Diego for training exercises, continuing to operate along the west coast for the next several years. ''Cushing'' was under overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor.  Following the attack, she did convoy duty between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, and later operated off Midway Island on anti-submarine patrol. In August 1942, ''Cushing'' sailed to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and later joined operations around Guadalcanal.<ref name=DANFS_Cushing>{{cite web|title=Cushing|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c16/cushing-ii.htm|publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]]|accessdate=15 August 2013|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships}}</ref>

In the fighting that followed, she sustained several hits amidships and slowly began to lose power, but was able to fire six torpedoes by local control at the Japanese battleship Hiei. In his book, Destroyer Operations in World War II (1953), Theodore Roscoe said, <U+201C> Three of the <U+201C>fish<U+201D> seemed to hit the bulls-eye; if they did, it was with tack-hammer thumps. They may have exploded prematurely. But Hiei's lookouts must of seen them coming, for the big ship swung her bow to the left and lumbered westward, disappearing into the smoke-haze.<U+201D>
By this time, "Cushing" was dead in the water, an easy target for repeated enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up.<ref>Roscoe pp. 193<U+2013>194</ref> ''Cushing'' received three battle stars for her World War II service.<ref Name=DANFS_Cushing/>
