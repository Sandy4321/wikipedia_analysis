'''Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.''' is an American chain of combined [[restaurant]] and [[Variety store|gift stores]] with a [[Southern United States|Southern]] country theme. The company was founded by [[Dan Evins]] in 1969;   its first store was   in [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]], [[Tennessee]], which remains the   company headquarters. The chain's  stores were traditionally positioned near highway exits in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] US, but it expanded across the country during the 1990s and 2000s. {{As of|2011|11|22|df=US}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investor.crackerbarrel.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=625875 |title=Cracker Barrel Reports Complete Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2012 |work=  |date=November 22, 2011|publisher=Cracker Barrel Old Country Store |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref> the chain operates 608 stores in 42 states.

A [[casual dining]] family restaurant, Cracker Barrel's menu is based on traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern cuisine]], with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned [[general store]]. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a stone fireplace, and artifacts from the local area. The chain has won numerous industry awards for its distinctive [[outdoor advertising]] along [[Interstate Highway System|US interstates]]. Cracker Barrel is known for its partnerships with [[country music]] artists, and has received attention for its charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and injured war veterans.

During the 1990s, the company was the subject of controversy for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African American and female employees. The company's treatment of minority customers was also criticized; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. Following an agreement with the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] and the implementation of non-discrimination policies, the company has focused on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added [[sexual orientation]] to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.

==History==
===First location and early growth===
Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 by [[Dan Evins]], a sales representative for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Oil]], who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve [[gasoline]] sales.<ref name=Rhein>{{cite news |title=Along the interstate with Cracker Barrel |first=Liz |last=Rhein |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4S5W-1K80-TX4X-W1B5&csi=140610&oc=00240&perma=true |magazine=Restaurant Business |date=June 10, 1987 |issue=V86 |issn=0097-8043 |page=112 |accessdate=January 25, 2012{{subscription required}}}}</ref> Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen to give it a Southern country theme,<ref name=Carlino>{{cite news |title=Dan W.

In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants.<ref name=Carlino/> These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during [[1973 oil crisis|gasoline shortages]] in the mid to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps.<ref name=Rhein/> Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues.<ref name=Thorp>{{cite news |title=Summer Tourists Improve Picture for Cracker Barrel |first=Susan |last=Adler Thorp |newspaper=Memphis Business Journal |date=April 28, 1986 |page=10}}</ref> Cracker Barrel became a [[Public company|publicly traded company]] in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion.<ref name=Rhein/><ref name=Gutner/> It floated more than half a million shares, raising $4.6 million.<ref name=Carlino/> Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20&nbsp;percent per year;<ref name=Strother/> by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.<ref name=Rhein/>

===New markets and refocus===

In 1994, the chain tested a [[Take-out|carry-out-only]] store, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Corner Market, in suburban residential neighborhoods.<ref name=Moritz/> In addition, it expanded into new markets through the establishment of more traditional Cracker Barrel locations, the majority of them outside the South, and  tested alterations to its menus to adapt to new regions.<ref name=Tarquinio>{{cite news |title=Cracker Barrel Customizes Menus, Changes Reflect Regional Tastes |first=J.

By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, and aimed to increase the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years.<ref name=Tarquinio/> The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997, and refocused on its restaurant and gift-store locations. Its then president, [[Ron Magruder]], stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country-store setting, with good service and country music.<ref name=Strother>{{cite news |title=President: Cracker Barrel is Rolling Along |first=Susan G. |last=Strother |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-02-01/business/9802020469_1_cracker-barrel-barrel-old-country-restaurant |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] (Florida) |date=February 1, 1998 |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |page=H1}}</ref> The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in [[Dothan, Alabama]].<ref name=Jackovics>{{cite news |title=Cracker Barrel opens new restaurants away from interstates |first=Ted |last=Jackovics |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-133622309/cracker-barrel-opens-new.html |newspaper=[[Tampa Tribune]] |date=June 26, 2005 |accessdate=January 21, 2012 {{subscription needed}}}}</ref> In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide [[Drive (charity)|book drive]] and a [[sweepstakes]] with trips to the [[Country Music Association Awards]] and rocking chairs among the prizes.<ref name=Hartmann>{{cite news |title=Cracker Barrel celebrates 30th with book drive, sweepstakes |first=Stacey |last=Hartmann |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4969-FMN0-01D1-81V2&csi=255267&oc=00240&perma=true |date=May 21, 1999 |page=6E |accessdate=January 25, 2012{{subscription required}}}}</ref>

===Innovation and later growth===
The number of combined restaurants and stores owned by Cracker Barrel approximately doubled between 1997 and 2000, to more than 420 locations. In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an [[Point of sale#Restaurant business|order-placement system]].<ref name=Leader>{{cite news |title=Fixing the Fixin's  |first=David  |last=Farkas |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62345581.html |newspaper=[[Chain Leader]] |date=May 1, 2000 |issn=1528-4999 |page=96 |accessdate=January 21, 2012 {{subscription needed}}}}</ref> From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers as customers.<ref name=Jackovics/> It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway [[Billboard (advertisement)|billboard advertisements]] to include images of menu items.
