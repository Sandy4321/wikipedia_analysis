'''Vettius Agorius Basilius Mavortius''' (floruit 527-534) was a Roman senator and Consul.

== Biography ==

Mavortius was probably the son of [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius]], Consul in 486, and related to [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]], an influential politician of the late 4th century. In 527, Mavortius held the positions of [[Comes domesticorum]] (Commander of the Imperial Guard) and [[Roman consul|Consul]].

Together with the orator Secur Memor Felix, Mavortius cured the parallel edition of the poetical works of the Pagan [[Horace]] and of the Christian [[Prudentius]], the so-called ''recensio mavortiana''; this edition is to be dated between 528 and 534 (when Felix obtained a higher rank).
