==Early years==

==University of Florida==

Ferguson entered the University of Florida as a freshman in the fall of 1938, and, after he became eligible as a sophomore, he quickly claimed his position as a three-year starter at [[end (American football)|end]] for coach [[Josh Cody]] and coach [[Tom Lieb]]'s [[Florida Gators football]] teams from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=ufmediaguide>''[http://web.gatorzone.com/football/media/2014/media_guide.pdf  Florida Football 2014 Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 79, 94, 150, 178 (2014).</ref>  Ferguson provided many of the highlights for the Gators during those years, "playing both ways," as was typical in the era of single platoon football.<ref name=carlson>Norm Carlson, ''University of Florida Football Vault: The History of the Florida Gators'', Whitman Publishing, LLC, Atlanta, Georgia, pp. 48<U+2013>49, 50 (2007).

As good or better on defense than he was on offense, his team records for career receptions (43) and career receiving yardage (668) remained unbroken until the 1960s, when Gators quarterbacks [[Steve Spurrier]] and [[John Reaves]] were throwing passes to star receivers [[Charles Casey (American football)|Charles Casey]], [[Richard Trapp]] and [[Carlos Alvarez (American football)|Carlos Alvarez]] in pro passing schemes.<ref name=carlson/>  He had a dramatic impact on the Gators prospects almost immediately as a sophomore starter in 1939, and played a key role in the Gators' 7<U+2013>0 upset of coach [[Frank Leahy]]'s [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College Eagles]] in Boston.<ref name=carlson/>  The Gators stopped the Eagles inside the Gators' 15-yard line eight times, while Ferguson recorded six tackles for a loss, including a dramatic tackle of Eagles quarterback [[Charlie O'Rourke]] on a fourth-down play from the Gators' 4-yard line, dropping O'Rourke nine yards behind the line of scrimmage.<ref name=carlson/>
