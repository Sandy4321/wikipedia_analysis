When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany at the start of [[World War I]] in August 1914, settler society in [[Southern Rhodesia]],{{refn|group=n|name=since1980|}} then [[company rule in Rhodesia|administered]] by the [[British South Africa Company]], received the news with great patriotic enthusiasm. The Company [[administrator of Southern Rhodesia|administrator]], [[William Henry Milton|Sir William Milton]], wired the UK government, "All Rhodesia&nbsp;... ready to do its duty".<ref name=mcl2/> Although it supported Britain, the Company was concerned about the possible financial implications for its chartered territory should it make direct commitments to the war effort, particularly at first, so most of the colony's contribution to the war was made by Southern Rhodesians individually<U+2014>not only those who volunteered to fight abroad, but also those who remained at home and raised funds to donate food, equipment and other supplies.

Starting immediately after the outbreak of war, parties of white Southern Rhodesians paid their own way to England to join the [[British Army]]. Most Southern Rhodesians who served in the war enlisted in this way and fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], taking part in many of the major battles with an assortment of British, South African and other colonial units, most commonly the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]], which recruited hundreds of men from the colony, and created homogenous Rhodesian platoons. Troopers from Southern Rhodesia became renowned on the Western Front for their marksmanship, a result of their frontier lifestyle. Some of the colony's men served in the [[Royal Flying Corps]], one of the two predecessors of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The [[Rhodesia Regiment]], the [[Rhodesia Native Regiment]] and the [[British South Africa Police]] served in the [[African theatre of World War I|African theatre]] of the conflict, contributing to the [[South-West Africa Campaign|South-West African]] and [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaigns]].

Though it was one of the few combatant territories not to raise fighting men through [[conscription]], proportional to white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more manpower to the British war effort than any other Imperial territory, including Britain itself. White troops numbered 5,716, about 40% of white men in the colony, with 1,720 of these serving as [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]]. The Rhodesia Native Regiment enlisted 2,507 black soldiers, about 30 blacks scouted for the Rhodesia Regiment, and around 350 served in British and South African units. Over 800 Southern Rhodesians of all races lost their lives on operational service during the war, with many more seriously wounded.

The territory's contributions during the First World War became a major entry in many histories of the colony, and a great source of pride for the white community, as well as for some black people. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant [[responsible government|self-government]] in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The First World War today has little presence in the Zimbabwean cultural memory.

[[File:Southern Rhodesia 1914.png|thumb|[[Southern Rhodesia]], highlighted in red on a map of Africa in 1914; other British possessions in pink|alt=A map. See description]]

At the time of [[World War I]] (also known as the First World War or the Great War), [[Southern Rhodesia]]{{refn|group=n|name=since1980|Renamed Zimbabwe in 1980.<ref>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin

The [[white people in Zimbabwe|white]] population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%),<ref name=walker664>{{Harvnb

|p=619}}</ref> The name "[[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]]" formally covered both north and south, but was often used to refer to the southern territory alone (for example, the names of almost all Southern Rhodesian military units omitted the word "Southern"). Soldiers from Southern Rhodesia generally described themselves simply as Rhodesians.<ref name=mcl84>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin

|p=84}}</ref>}} With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the [[chartered company|Chartered Company]] and those who advocated [[responsible government]], which would make Southern Rhodesia a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[British Empire]].<ref name=mcl1>{{harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=1}}</ref> Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the [[Union of South Africa]], which had been formed in 1910.{{#tag:ref|Section 150 of the [[South Africa Act 1909]], which formed the Union, explicitly provisioned for the accession to it of [[company rule in Rhodesia|Company-administered]] territories as new provinces.<ref name=wood8>{{Harvnb

Reserves existed in the form of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, an all-white amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers in a conventional war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only.<ref name=mcl4>{{Harvnb

==Outbreak of war==

===Announcement and reception===

When Britain declared war on Germany at 23:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time]] on 4 August 1914, the British Empire's [[dominion]]s and colonies automatically became involved as well. Word of this reached the Southern Rhodesian capital [[Harare|Salisbury]] during the night. Early on 5 August, even before releasing the news publicly, the Company [[administrator of Southern Rhodesia|administrator]] [[William Henry Milton|Sir William Milton]] wired [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]]: "All Rhodesia united in devoted loyalty to King and Empire and ready to do its duty."<ref name=mcl2/> A few hours later he officially announced to the populace that Southern Rhodesia was at war.<ref name=mcl2>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=2}}</ref> The ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' and ''Bulawayo Chronicle'' newspapers published special editions the same day to spread the news;<ref name=mcl1/> it took about half a week for word to reach the whole country, but [[jingoism|jingoistic]] demonstrations began in the major towns almost immediately.<ref name=mcl2/>

In the words of historian [[Peter McLaughlin]], the Southern Rhodesian settlers "seemed to out-British the British" in their patriotic zeal,<ref name=mcliv>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=iv}}</ref> so it was to the frustration of many of them that the Company did not immediately commit to any martial action. While it sent supportive messages to Whitehall, the Company felt it could not raise any kind of expeditionary force without first considering the implications for its administrative operations; as a commercial concern, it was possible for the Company to go bankrupt. Who would foot the bill for war expenditure, its hierarchy pondered: the Company itself, the Rhodesian taxpayers or the British government?<ref name=mcl3/>

As the local newspapers filled with letters from readers clamouring for Rhodesian troops to be mustered and despatched to Europe post-haste,<ref name=mcl3>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=3}}</ref> the administration limited its initial contribution to posting a section of BSAP troopers to the [[Victoria Falls Bridge]] to guard against possible German attack from [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] though the [[Caprivi Strip]].<ref name=mcl4/> In early September, an indignant letter to the ''Rhodesia Herald'' from Colonel [[Raleigh Grey]], a major figure in local business, politics and military matters, accused the Company of bringing "a slur on a British country" by doing so little.<ref name=mcl3/>

===Rhodesian Reserves===
A few days after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an amorphous entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]] and other local organisations mirrored the [[Pals battalion]]s in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.<ref name=mcl5>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=5}}</ref>

The Company suggested to the UK government that it might despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe to act as an all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] (in Belgium and France), but the [[War Office]] in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted.<ref name=mcl8>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=8}}</ref> Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the [[British Army]] directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.<ref name=mcl5/>

==Europe==

===Western Front===
[[File:Rhodesians of King Edward's Horse, WW1.png|thumb|Southern Rhodesian members of [[King Edward's Horse]], a [[British Army]] cavalry regiment|alt=Soldiers in British uniforms of First World War vintage pose for a formative shot]]
In terms of fighting manpower, Southern Rhodesia's main contribution to World War I was in the [[trench warfare|trenches]] of the Western Front.<ref name=mcl49/> As the Southern Rhodesian whites in this theatre joined the British Army separately, at different times and under their own steam (or were already connected to specific units as reservists), they were spread across dozens of regiments, including the [[Black Watch]], the [[Coldstream Guards]], the [[Grenadier Guards]], the [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Marines]], as well as many South African units and others.<ref name=mcl147to149>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|pp=147<U+2013>149}}</ref> During the war's opening months, Southern Rhodesian volunteers who could not afford to travel to England were assisted by a private fund set up by [[Ernest Lucas Guest]], a Salisbury lawyer and Anglo-Boer War veteran who also organised an accompanying recruitment campaign for European service. Guest stopped recruiting at the Company's request after it created the [[Rhodesia Regiment|1st Rhodesia Regiment]], an expeditionary force to South and South-West Africa, in October 1914.<ref name=gale739>{{Harvnb

A link developed during the war with the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent<U+2014>numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions<U+2014>was the largest on the Western Front.<ref name=mcl49>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=49}}</ref> The connection with this particular corps began as the result of a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from [[Cape Town]] to [[Southampton]] in late 1914. The [[Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester|16th Marquess of Winchester]], who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain [[John Banks Brady]], the Irish-born officer who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it might be a good idea for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the [[Winchester]]-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC. A designated Rhodesian platoon, widely referred to thereafter as "the Rhodesian Platoon", was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at [[Sheerness]], on the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in [[Kent]].<ref name=ferris>{{Harvnb

As a rule, the Southern Rhodesian whites overseas combined stridently pro-British attitudes with an even stronger pride in Rhodesia.<ref name="mcl84"/> Many of them saw participation in the war, particularly in distinct "Rhodesian" formations, as a step towards forging a distinctive national identity, like those of Australia and the other more mature British dominions, and building a case for Southern Rhodesian self-government.<ref name=stapleton19>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|p=19}}</ref> The existence of an explicitly Rhodesian Platoon in the KRRC endeared the regiment to the Southern Rhodesian public, and attracted many of the colony's volunteers who arrived in England later in the war; in time, the KRRC formed further Rhodesian platoons from additional personnel. While the average Rhodesian colonial, living on the frontier of the Empire, was at least casually acquainted with rifles, most Englishmen had never held one. At Sheerness, Brady's Rhodesian Platoon won a reputation for fine sharpshooting, and set a regimental record score at the shooting range.<ref name=mcl50>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=50}}</ref>

Once posted to France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost immediately began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often took a few months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action.<ref name=mcl50to51/> When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive [[battle cry]] that their men shouted as they went over the top.<ref name=mcl84/> Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of [[Shona language|Shona]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|Sindebele]] (two indigenous African languages) instead of English.<ref name=mcl57>{{Harvnb

German [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas attacks]] were among the most traumatic experiences for the Southern Rhodesians in Europe. One Rhodesian survivor of a gas attack described the sensation as like "suffocation, [or] slow drowning".<ref name=mcl116117/> The Germans used both disabling agents, such as [[tear gas]] and the more severe [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], and lethal chemicals like [[chlorine]] and [[phosgene]]. Though generally not fatal, gas attacks caused extreme physical discomfort and pain, often to the point where soldiers lost consciousness. Mustard gas in particular caused blistering of the skin, vomiting and internal and external bleeding. The British Army issued [[gas mask]]s, but according to Brady these did little to help the men. Injuries sustained to the eyes, lungs and nasal passages in gas attacks were often extremely debilitating and lasting, remaining with the men for years after the war.<ref name=mcl116117>{{Harvnb

In July 1917, a KRRC Rhodesian platoon received lofty praise from a senior British officer, who described the colonials as "absolutely first-class soldiers and great gentlemen, every bit as good as soldiers&nbsp;... as our old [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]]".<ref name=mcl63>{{Harvnb

After a heavy artillery bombardment, German infantry and marines charged the British positions and surrounded the Rhodesian platoon. Brutal hand-to-hand fighting ensued in which most of the Southern Rhodesians were killed and some were taken prisoner.

Apart from the capture of [[Luhonono|Schuckmannsburg]] in the Caprivi Strip by a combined force of BSAP and [[Northern Rhodesia Police]] on 21 September 1914, the British South Africa Company's own armed forces and police remained almost totally uninvolved in the war until the following month. The South African Prime Minister, the former Boer general [[Louis Botha]], had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South-West Africa without help, so the Imperial garrison had been sent to the Western Front. Lieutenant-Colonel [[Manie Maritz]]<U+2014>an ex-Boer commander who now headed a column of [[Afrikaans]]-speaking Union troops<U+2014>defected to the Germans in mid-September, hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old [[Boer Republic]]s.<ref name=mcl7>{{Harvnb

After six weeks' training in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, the last stop before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. Notwithstanding these grand farewells, the [[Maritz Rebellion]] was all but over by the time the Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at [[Bloemfontein]].<ref name=mcl9to14/> The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed.<ref name=chanock22>{{Harvnb

During late December 1914, Northern Force travelled to the South African [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of [[Walvis Bay]], about halfway up the coast of German South-West Africa. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment disembarked on 26 December 1914.<ref name=mcl9to14>{{Harvnb

Northern Force made up the northern prong of a pincer movement designed by Botha to encircle the German forces in South-West Africa. Two smaller South African columns came from the Cape and the Orange Free State (the latter coming over the deserts of [[Bechuanaland]]). The principal target was [[Windhoek]], the capital of South-West Africa. The field of operations was arid and barren in the extreme; water was a precious commodity, so the South Africans and Southern Rhodesians brought thousands of tons of it with them. In the {{convert|100|km}} of desert between Walvis Bay and Windhoek, temperatures could rise to above {{convert|50|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in the daytime, then drop below freezing at night, all while desert winds blew sand and dust into every bodily and mechanical orifice. Germany based much of its defensive strategy in South-West Africa around the assumption that no enemy commander could feasibly attempt to advance across the desert from Walvis Bay to Windhoek, but Botha resolved to do exactly that.<ref name=mcl13to15>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|pp=13<U+2013>15}}</ref>

The South African offensive from Walvis Bay began in February 1915, when Northern Force took [[Swakopmund]]<U+2014>the nearest German coastal settlement, about {{convert|20|km}} north<U+2014>without facing major resistance. The Germans almost immediately retreated, leaving behind explosive booby traps and other improvised weapons. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment first engaged the Germans while Northern Force moved east across the desert, taking part in a number of minor skirmishes and suffering its first two fatalities in a German ambush. To overcome the natural difficulties of the desert terrain, Botha used fast-moving mounted or mechanised troops rather than regular infantry, so the Southern Rhodesian contingent played little part in the main advance on Windhoek. The Rhodesians guarded the construction of a railway inland for the much of the campaign, but participated in Northern Force's victory over the Germans at Trekkopjes, losing Lieutenant Hollingsworth (killed in action) and five enlisted men (wounded). Windhoek surrendered to Botha in July 1915, effectively ending the South-West African front of the war. German [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] actions in the territory during the rest of the hostilities were minimal.<ref name=mcl15to18/>

The 1st Rhodesia Regiment was soon posted back to Cape Town, where many of the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of fighting in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded due to a lack of personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.<ref name=mcl15to18>{{Harvnb

===2nd Rhodesia Regiment===
Based around the overflow of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, a core of personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved that they might have to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.<ref name=mcl2325>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|pp=23<U+2013>25, 30}}</ref>

Because it was raised with less urgency, the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment received better training than the 1st. The course lasted eight weeks, a fortnight longer than the original regiment's training period, and focused heavily on route marching, parade drill, and, in particular, marksmanship<U+2014>recruits were trained to accurately shoot at ranges up to {{convert|600|m}}. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment left Salisbury on 8 March 1915, moving east to the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] in [[Portuguese Mozambique]], from where they sailed to [[Mombasa]] in British [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], on German East Africa's north-eastern flank. Travelling aboard the SS ''Umzumbi'', the battalion disembarked in Kenya less than a week after leaving Salisbury. It was immediately sent inland to the operational area around [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], within sight of which it set up camp. On 20 March, the regiment was inspected by General J&nbsp;M Stewart of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]]. "I had expected to see a regiment that would require some training," Stewart said; "I will pay you the highest compliment by sending you to the front today." So began the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment's contribution to the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]].<ref name=mcl2325/>

The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment operated with some success during its first year on the front. It usually defeated German units that it encountered, but the Germans, using proto-guerrilla tactics, tended to retreat before they could be overrun. Though generally outnumbered and outgunned throughout the campaign, the Germans had the advantage early on of  longer-range artillery than the British; from July to August 1916, 2RR was prevented from moving out of the Kenyan town of [[Makindu]] for nearly a month by German bombardment. The huge marching distances, difficult terrain and uncertainty of surroundings meant that the regiment's men were forced to develop enormous stamina and resilience if they were not to be invalided home.<ref name=mcl3034>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|pp=30<U+2013>34}}</ref>

Tropical disease killed or rendered ineffective far more 2RR men than the Germans did; at times the regiment was reduced to an effective strength of under 100 by the vast myriad of potential ailments, including [[trench fever]], [[blackwater fever]], [[dysentery]], [[pneumonia]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and many others. The 1,038 personnel who served with 2RR in East Africa collectively went into hospital 2,272 times, and there were 10,626 incidences of illness<U+2014>in other words, the average 2RR soldier was hospitalised twice and reported sick 10 times.<ref name=mcl3941/> In January 1917, only 91 of the regiment's men were considered fit for duty;<ref name=mcl3941>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|pp=39<U+2013>41}}</ref> it was no longer an effective fighting force, and the white Southern Rhodesian manpower did not exist to continue reinforcing it. It was therefore withdrawn from East Africa that month. Those men who were healthy enough to return home arrived back in Salisbury on 14 April 1917, receiving a tumultuous welcome, but the majority of 2RR remained in medical care overseas for some time afterwards.<ref name=mcl46>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin

The Company briefly considered sending a revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front, but the British Army promptly rejected this idea, saying that the unit would be impractical for trench warfare because of its small size. The battalion was thereupon dissolved, but most of its remaining men went to war in Europe anyway, generally with South African units.<ref name=mcl46/>

===Rhodesia Native Regiment===

By late 1915, British forces in the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's south-western flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. [[Francis Chaplin|Francis Drummond Chaplin]], the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 ''askaris'', and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would foot the bill for the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916<U+2014>the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British [[Colonial Office]]<U+2014>recruitment began in May.<ref name=stapleton2022/>

Initial recruitment efforts principally targeted the Matabele, who made up about 20% of the colony's black population, because they enjoyed a popular reputation among whites for being great warriors; the unit was therefore originally called the "Matabele Regiment".<ref name=stapleton2022>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|pp=20<U+2013>22}}</ref> This was changed to the more inclusive "[[Rhodesia Native Regiment]]" (RNR) on 15 May 1916, as the ranks proved to be more diverse than expected, and included large numbers of [[Shona people|Mashona]]s and other ethnicities.<ref name=binda17/> In particular, a disproportionately high number of volunteers came from the [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]] tribe, a numerically diminutive community in the colony's south-west.<ref name=stapleton39>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|p=39}}</ref> The RNR was  organised largely along linguistic and cultural lines, with companies and platoons of Matabele, Mashona, [[Yao people (East Africa)|Wayao]] and others. White officers attached to the unit were often recruited because they knew an indigenous African language, or could give orders in [[Fanagalo|Chilapalapa]], a [[pidgin]] of English and several African tongues often referred to by whites of the time as "kitchen kaffir". The ranks' diversity sometimes led to confusion when messages or directives were not properly understood. It became common for black troopers accused of disobeying or ignoring commands to claim ignorance of the language in which they had been ordered.<ref>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|p=49}}</ref>

Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel A J Tomlinson, the RNR, comprising 426 ''askaris'' and about 30 white officers, left Salisbury in July 1916 for Beira. They continued on to [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]], in Nyasaland, where they were to receive further training closer to the field of operations. When they arrived, the local situation had shifted significantly, so the RNR instead went to New Langenberg, in German East Africa, just north of [[Lake Malawi|Lake Nyasa]]. At New Langenberg the regiment went through a short training course, and was issued with six machine guns. When the unit's training period ended in October 1916 it was divided; one company of RNR men went to Buhora, about {{convert|250|km}} north-east, while the rest went {{convert|250|km}} south to Weidhaven, on the north banks of Lake Nyasa, from where they moved {{convert|160|km}} east to [[Songea]], which they were ordered to "hold&nbsp;... until reinforced". Apart from a company of men sent to patrol the road back to Weidhaven, the RNR proceeded to garrison Songea.<ref name=binda18>{{Harvnb
|Binda
|2007
|p=18}}</ref>

The Germans, who had left Songea only a few weeks before, sent two columns to retake it during early November 1916<U+2014>250 ''askaris'' marched from Likuyu, and 180 more (with two machine guns) set off from Kitanda. The latter German column spotted the RNR company that was patrolling the road, and at Mabogoro attacked the advance guard, which was commanded by Sergeant (later Lieutenant) [[Frederick Charles Booth]]. The Rhodesians were caught by surprise, and many panicked, running about and firing randomly. Booth restored discipline and led the defence until reinforcements arrived. The Germans then retreated and continued towards Songea. During this contact, Booth advanced towards enemy fire to rescue a wounded scout who was lying in the open, and brought him back alive; for this and subsequent actions, Booth received the [[Victoria Cross]] in June 1917.<ref name=binda18/>

The German column from Kitanda reached Songea early in the morning on 12 November 1916, and unsuccessfully attempted a frontal assault on the well-entrenched Rhodesian positions. After the German column from Likuyu arrived in the afternoon, the Germans laid siege to Songea for 12 days before retreating towards Likuyu on the 24th. The Rhodesians were relieved the following day by a South African unit. The RNR then moved back to Litruchi, on the other side of Lake Nyasa,<ref name=binda18/> from where they sailed to the German East African town of [[Mwaya]], where they were reunited with the RNR contingent that had gone to Buhora. This second column had ambushed a group of Germans, who were moving towards Northern Rhodesia with a naval gun salvaged from [[SMS K<U+00F6>nigsberg (1905)|SMS ''K<U+00F6>nigsberg'']] (which had been sunk at [[Battle of Rufiji Delta|Rufiji Delta]] about a year before); after pocketing the Germans, the Rhodesians captured both them and the naval gun.<ref name=binda19>{{Harvnb
|Binda

|p=19}}</ref>

In Southern Rhodesia, Company officials judged the RNR to have been a success so far, and so decided in January 1917 to raise a second battalion. The unit already in the field was at this time designated 1st Battalion, abbreviated to "1RNR", while the new formation was called 2nd Battalion, or "2RNR".<ref name=binda19/> Recruitment was soon under way. Conscious of the difficulty that had been found in persuading rural Mashonas and Matabele to join the 1st Battalion in 1916, organisers for 2RNR principally targeted black men from other countries, in particular migrant workers from Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia;<ref name=mcl75>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=75}}</ref> Nyasalanders eventually made up nearly half of the regiment.{{#tag:ref||group="n"|name="rnr"}} By the start of March, about 1,000 recruits were training in Salisbury. Meanwhile, 1RNR was instructed to guard the Igali Pass, near the border with Northern Rhodesia, to prevent a column of Germans from threatening the settlements of [[Mbala, Zambia|Abercorn]] and Fife. When the Germans slipped through, the Rhodesians were pulled back to a position between the two towns and instructed to defend either one as circumstances dictated. The Germans did not launch an attack, however, instead setting up camp in their own territory at [[Galula]].<ref name=binda19/>

The Southern Rhodesian commanders planned to destroy the German column by taking advantage of the regional geography; the Germans had [[Lake Rukwa]] to their back, and the rivers Songwe and Saisi on their respective left (eastern) and right flanks, effectively hemming them in if they were attacked. The plan was that elements of 1RNR would hold the Saisi while a battalion of the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) manned the Songwe; the rest of 1RNR would then push the Germans back towards the lake. But Tomlinson interpreted his orders as requiring immediate action, and attacked before the two flanking lines were in place on the rivers. The offensive had some successes at first, even though Tomlinson was outnumbered, but the 450 Germans, armed with three ''K<U+00F6>nigsberg'' field guns and 14 machine guns, soon withdrew to the higher ground at St Moritz Mission.<ref name=binda19/> The Germans counterattacked over the following week. Colonel R&nbsp;E Murray, who commanded a column of BSAP men about {{convert|10|km}} away, did not assist Tomlinson, and 1RNR took great losses while repulsing the attack: 58 RNR men were killed, and the Germans captured three Rhodesian machine guns. Tomlinson was blamed by most for the debacle, but he insisted for years afterwards that he had only been following orders from Murray to hold his ground. He expressed incredulity at Murray's failure to reinforce him. An enquiry into the matter was avoided when Tomlinson was wounded and invalided home soon after the battle.<ref name=binda20>{{Harvnb

On 5 April 1917, 1RNR crossed the Songwe River into German East Africa and advanced south-east towards Kitanda. It moved up the winding Lupa River, crossing it at each turn, for 53 days, and by mid-June was {{convert|30|km}} north of its target. When it was then ordered to backtrack north to [[Rungwe District|Rungwe]], it covered the {{convert|420|km}} in 16 days.<ref name=binda21/> Several scholars highlight the distances marched by the RNR, and comment that their physical endurance must have been remarkable, particularly given the speed at which they moved. "One can only marvel at the hardiness and fortitude of these men who matter-of-factly marched distances unthinkable to modern Western soldiers," historian Alexandre Binda writes.<ref name=binda21>{{Harvnb

The 1st Battalion harassed the constantly moving German [[flying column]] during August and September 1917. Two [[Military Medal]]s were won by RNR soldiers during this time: Sergeant Northcote rescued a wounded ''askari'' under German fire in late August, and a few days later Corporal Suga, himself lightly injured, dragged his wounded commanding officer Booth out of the open and into cover.<ref name=binda22/> The 2nd Battalion, comprising Major Jackson at the head of 585 ''askaris'' and 75 whites, left Salisbury on 16 September 1917,<ref name=binda21/> and joined the front on 16 October, when it arrived at Mbewa on the north-eastern shore of Lake Nyasa, intending to ultimately merge with 1RNR.<ref name=binda22>{{Harvnb

In late May 1916, the two-year service contracts signed by the original 500 RNR volunteers expired, and the majority of those who had not already been discharged<U+2014>just under 400 men<U+2014>went home. While passing through [[Mutare|Umtali]] on their way to Salisbury, the soldiers encountered the RNR's original commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Tomlinson, whom they promptly mobbed, excitedly chanting ''nkosi, nkosi'' (which roughly means "chief" in Sindebele).<ref name=stapleton125>{{Harvnb

In Mozambique, the RNR encountered Lettow-Vorbeck's supply column near Mtarika on 22 May 1918. It wiped it out (capturing two German officers, two German ''askaris'', 34 Portuguese ''askaris'' and 252 carriers), but as the supply column had been marching between the main German column and its rearguard, Lettow-Vorbeck was then able to attack the RNR from both sides. The contact lasted until darkness fell, and the RNR held its position. Lettow-Vorbeck then moved further south, with the RNR following.<ref name=binda23/> This pursuit continued for the rest of the war, with Lettow-Vorbeck avoiding contacts so far as was possible and constantly resupplying his men by briefly occupying isolated towns.

Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I were all volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male settlers of fighting age were expected to abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many of them were in vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that [[conscription]] might be required if not enough joined up.<ref name=mcl8892>{{Harvnb

The idea of conscription ran contrary to British political tradition, but the sheer scale of the Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916. The ''Rhodesia Herald'' and ''Bulawayo Chronicle'' newspapers broadcast the news in special editions. While some settlers supported the extension of the same system to Southern Rhodesian whites, it was also opposed in many quarters. The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might jeopardise its mining operations, crucial to the colonial economy, while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons. Some, mindful of [[John Chilembwe]]'s anticolonial uprising in Nyasaland in early 1915, felt that it was necessary to keep a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the 1890s Mashona and Matabele rebellions.<ref name=mcl8892/>

By late 1916, most settlers in the colony who were inclined to volunteer had already done so. To free up white manpower, some suggested the recruitment of older men for local service so more of the younger volunteers could go overseas. In 1917, the Chartered Company set up a committee to consider the question of national defence both during the war and thereafter; its report, released in February 1918, described reliance on volunteers as inefficient, and recommended the institution of compulsory service for whites, even after the war (no mention was made of using black troops in the future). The Company published proposals the following month to register all white males aged between 18 and 65 with a view to some form of conscription, but this provoked widespread and vocal dissent, particularly from farmers. In the face of this opposition the administration vacillated until it quietly dropped the idea after the armistice.<ref name=mcl8892/>

===Economic impact===

The British South Africa Company had reservations about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's resources to the war effort, in part because of its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in sourcing manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal [[ferrochrome]]. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, [[tungsten]], near [[Esigodini|Essexvale]] in southern [[Matabeleland]] in May 1917.<ref name=mcl102to106>{{Harvnb

Southern Rhodesia's other main economic arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, partly because the Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines at the behest of British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make much of an impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.<ref name=mcl102to106/>

The war began to adversely affect the economy in late 1917. The Company threatened petrol rationing in November 1917, and in early 1918 it raised the colonial [[income tax]] to help balance the books. By the end of the hostilities the Company had spent <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million on the 
war effort, most of which was covered by the Rhodesian taxpayers; the Company covered some of the expenditure itself, and also received a small amount of financial aid from the UK government.<ref name=mcl102to106/>

===Propaganda and public opinion===
[[File:British Lusitania poster 1915 LOC cph.3g10930.jpg|thumb|upright|A British propaganda poster urging men to "take up the sword of justice" to avenge the [[sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking]] of the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] by a German [[U-boat]]|alt=A poster with large red letters. Most prominent are the phrases "Remember the Lusitania. It is YOUR Duty. Enlist To-Day".]]
Mass media on both sides in the conflict tried to motivate their respective populations and justify the war's continuation by creating an image of the enemy so grotesque and savage that surrender became unthinkable. Like the major newspapers in Britain, the ''Rhodesia Herald'' and the ''Bulawayo Chronicle'' became key [[propaganda]] tools, regularly printing stories of German atrocities, massacres and other war crimes alongside articles simply entitled "War Stories" that told of British Army soldiers carrying out deeds of Herculean bravery. [[Anti-German sentiment]] abounded in the territory throughout the conflict, and periodically intensified, often concurrently with the reporting of particularly unsavoury incidents.<ref name=mcl8085>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin

|pp=80<U+2013>85}}</ref>

During the initial peak of Germanophobia, which lasted the first few months of the conflict, many German and Austrian men of military age who lived in Rhodesia were arrested (officially as "prisoners of war") and sent to internment camps in South Africa. [[Gertrude Page]], one of the colony's most famous novelists, wrote an open letter in response, vouching for the loyalty of a young German in her employ, and received a number of replies accusing her of being unpatriotic.<ref name=mcl6>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|pp=5<U+2013>6}}</ref> The second period of intensification began following the [[sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking]] of the British passenger liner [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] by a German [[U-boat]] on 7 May 1915. The ''Rhodesia Herald'' ran an editorial soon after calling on the Company administration to inter all remaining German and Austrian residents and to close their businesses. A town assembly in Umtali sent the administrator a resolution asking him to confiscate all property in the colony owned by subjects of Germany and Austria within 48 hours "in view of German barbarity". Most of Southern Rhodesia's remaining German and Austrian residents were soon sent to the camps in South Africa.<ref name=mcl8085/>

Further periods of intensified anti-German feeling in the Rhodesias followed the execution by the Germans of the British nurse [[Edith Cavell]] in Belgium in October 1915 ("the Crowning Crime", the ''Bulawayo Chronicle'' called it), the escalation of [[German strategic bombing during World War I|bombing raids]] by German [[Zeppelin]]s on British cities during 1917, and the reporting the same year by British media of the alleged existence of the ''[[kadaververwertungsanstalt]]'', a factory where the Germans supposedly rendered down battlefield corpses from both sides to make [[nitroglycerine]], lubricants and other products.<ref name=mcl8085/>

A small elite of black urbanites, mostly raised and educated at [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missions]], existed in Southern Rhodesia by the time of the war, and these generally identified themselves strongly with settler society and, by extension, the war effort.<ref name=stapleton30>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|p=30}}</ref> But the vast majority of black people in the colony retained their traditional tribal lifestyles of rural subsistence farming,<ref name=stapleton2325/> and for most of them, as McLaughlin comments, the war "could have been fought between aliens from different planets for all their connection with events in Europe".<ref name=mcl73>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=73}}</ref> Some felt obliged to "fight for their country", seeing the travails of Rhodesia and the Empire as their own also,<ref name=stapleton40>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|p=40}}</ref> but the great bulk of tribal public opinion was detached, seeing the conflict as a "white man's war" that did not concern them. Those who favoured the latter line of thinking cared not so much about the conflict itself but more about how its course might affect them specifically. For example, widespread interest was aroused soon after the outbreak of war when rumours began to fly between the rural black communities that the Company planned to conscript them. News of the Maritz Rebellion prompted a fresh rumour among the Matabele that Company officials might confiscate tribal livestock to feed the white troops going south. None of this actually occurred.<ref name=stapleton2325>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|pp=23<U+2013>25}}</ref>

The Chartered Company's native commissioners began to fear a possible tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people to emulate the Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and telling them that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona ''[[svikiro]]'' (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any ''svikiro'' who gained significant popularity.<ref name=stapleton2325/>

The only real threat of a black rebellion in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Most Matabele chiefs were friendly with the Company,<ref name=stapleton2627/> and some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment in the RNR by sending their own sons off to war.<ref>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|p=155}}</ref> Company officials attempted to make clear that the RNR comprised volunteers only, but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in [[Insiza (District)|Insiza]] district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening.<ref name=stapleton2627>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|pp=26<U+2013>27}}</ref> Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined <U+00A3>4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the black Southern Rhodesian drivers who had gone to East Africa with the British East Africa Transport Corps had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the [[syncretism|syncretist]] [[Church of the White Bird]] in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR on the grounds that the British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.<ref name=mclaughlin9697>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin

The colony's small Afrikaner community was split on the issue of war. Some supported the United Kingdom out of loyalty to Rhodesia, but others were still bitter about the Anglo-Boer War and showed little interest in fighting the Germans. In the rural areas, where [[Afrikaner nationalism]] was strongest, the Germans were perceived by some Boer farmers as potential liberators from British domination. Southern Rhodesian Afrikaners were often accused of undermining the British war effort. While some leaders of the community publicly came out in support of the war and offered to provide troops, others put pressure on Afrikaans-speakers not to volunteer. When recruitment for the Rhodesia Native Regiment began in 1916, there were reports of potential black recruits being urged not to join up by their Afrikaans-speaking employers.<ref name=mclaughlin9697/>

===Women===

As is common in frontier societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: at the time of the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.<ref>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=120}}</ref>

The contribution to the war made by Southern Rhodesia's white female population generally comprised organising and running donation drives, comforts committees and other similar enterprises. They sent the troops "comforts parcels", which contained balaclavas, mittens and scarves that they had knitted, as well as newspapers, soap, food (including cakes and sweets), and minor luxuries. These packages did much to raise the morale of the men, particularly those who were in German captivity. Women were also largely responsible for handling mail between Rhodesian soldiers and their relatives and friends back home. After the armistice, they organised financial assistance for those discharged Southern Rhodesian men in England who could not afford to come home, and arranged visits for those convalescing in English hospitals.<ref>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=121}}</ref>

As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women during the war presented men not wearing military uniform with [[white feather]]s (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, as many of the men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the ''Rhodesia Herald'' and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.<ref name=mcl123>{{Harvnb
|McLaughlin
|1980
|p=123}}</ref>

Black women played a minor role in units such as the Rhodesia Native Regiment, [[camp follower|accompanying]] the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated the presence of these women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the men would probably lead to mutiny.<ref>{{Harvnb

===Donations and funds===

Southern Rhodesian settlers set up a number of wartime funds, including funds to aid war victims, funds to provide the troops with tobacco and other supplies, funds to assist orphans and widows, funds to buy aeroplanes, and others. These raised about <U+00A3>200,000 in all. Much of this went to the Prince of Wales' National Relief Fund in England, which was founded when the war started; Southern Rhodesian branches of the fund were promptly organised in several towns and ultimately consolidated into the Rhodesian War Relief Fund. This body donated 25% of its receipts to the Prince of Wales' Fund and 75% to local concerns.<ref name=mcl92to93/>

The Tobacco Fund, set up in September 1914, was particularly successful. Public donors bought Southern Rhodesian tobacco, cigarettes and pipe tobacco to send to the British forces. This was intended not only to comfort the troops, but also to advertise the prospect of post-war emigration to Rhodesia. The labels on the tobacco tins depicted a map of Africa with the sun shining on Rhodesia, accompanied by the slogan "The World's Great Sunspot". In a similar vein, "Sunspot" was the name given to the Rhodesian cigarettes that British soldiers received. During the war, British and colonial soldiery collectively chewed and smoked 59,955 two-ounce (57 g) tins of donated Southern Rhodesian tobacco, 80,584 two-ounce tins of equivalent pipe tobacco, and 4,004,000 Sunspot cigarettes (in packs of 10). Another similar undertaking saw six tons (roughly 6,100&nbsp;kg) of local citrus fruits sent to wounded British Army personnel in South Africa and England.<ref name=mcl92to93/>

Starting in July 1915, Southern Rhodesians raised funds to buy aeroplanes for the Royal Flying Corps. The colony ultimately bought three aircraft, each of which cost <U+00A3>1,500<U+2014>they were named Rhodesia Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Residents of the town of Gatooma also set up their own drive, which funded the purchase of two more planes, Gatooma Nos. 1 and 2.<ref name=mcl71to72/><ref name=mcl92to93/>

The black elite in the towns donated to the settlers' patriotic funds and organisations, and also set up their own. A war fundraising tea organised by black Salisburians in early March 1915 boasted entertainment in the form of a black choir, as well as the presence of Taylor and a junior native commissioner, each of whom gave speeches in English, Sindebele and Shona. Rural black people, by contrast, did not generally understand the concept of donating money to war funds, and misinterpreted encouragement to do so as being threatened with a new tax. When the Matabele chief Gambo began collecting war donations from his people in early 1915, also urging other chiefs to do the same, he took care to thoroughly explain the war fund's purpose and the voluntary nature of contributing, but some villagers still misunderstood and came to believe they would have livestock confiscated if they did not give money. The Company ultimately sent officials around the countryside to clarify the matter.<ref name=stapleton2730>{{Harvnb
|Stapleton
|2006
|pp=27<U+2013>30}}</ref>

The Kalanga, a small community in the south-west that provided a disproportionately large number of volunteers for the Rhodesia Native Regiment, also proved conspicuous for their extremely generous financial donations; in June 1915, they collectively donated <U+00A3>183, "a staggering sum", historian Timothy Stapleton comments, to the Prince of Wales' Fund.<ref name=stapleton2730/>

===Flu pandemic===

The [[1918 flu pandemic]], often referred to at the time as "Spanish flu", spread quickly into Southern Rhodesia from South Africa in October 1918. A week after the first case was reported in Salisbury, over 1,000&nbsp;people were infected. Public buildings in the towns were converted into makeshift hospital wards, appeals were put out for trained nurses to attend the sick, and soup kitchens were set up to feed children whose parents were too ill to look after them. Newspapers in the colony published basic instructions on how to deal with the disease.<ref name=mcl106107/> The mine compounds, where hundreds of black labourers lived and worked together in close proximity, were worst affected. The whole country was ultimately infected, with even the most remote villages reporting deaths.<ref name=mcl106107/> Many members of the Rhodesia Native Regiment were infected, and 76 of them died from the disease having survived the war.<ref>{{Harvnb

==End of the war, aftermath and statistics==

News of the armistice on 11 November 1918 reached Southern Rhodesia the same day, and was announced to the town of Salisbury by the repeated blowing of the klaxon at the [[Castle Brewery]]. Hysterical street parties started almost immediately, and in the evening the people let off fireworks and lit a huge bonfire on Salisbury [[kopje]]. Bulawayo celebrated with a street party that continued uninterrupted for over 48 hours. Smaller towns marked the armistice with their own celebratory functions and events.<ref name=mcl138140>{{Harvnb

Many former soldiers failed to find jobs, however, and some remained unemployed for years after they returned home. Some of the more seriously wounded from the European theatre never came back at all, instead remaining in England because of the better medical facilities and public benefits. Demobilised Western Front veterans began to arrive back in Rhodesia in January 1919, and continued to do so for nearly a year afterwards. On 30 May 1919, the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council]] passed a resolution thanking the territory's veterans.<ref name=mcl138140/>

By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' service on Britain's behalf in both World Wars was an integral part of the colony's national psyche.<ref name=moorcraft1990/> The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in [[Southern Rhodesian military involvement in the Malayan Emergency|Malaya]],<ref>{{Harvnb

Since the country's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, [[Robert Mugabe]]'s administration has pulled down many monuments and plaques making reference to the fallen of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, as well as those memorialising members of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] killed during the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] of the 1970s.<ref name=stapleton1to5/> Many Zimbabweans today see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that had more to do with the white community than the indigenous black majority, and most in the country have little interest in its contributions to those conflicts. The national war memorial obelisk still stands, but the relief sculptures and inscriptions have been removed. The stone cross monument near Mutare (as Umtali is now [[Place names in Zimbabwe|called]]) is one of the few memorials that remains intact and its place, atop what is now called Cross Kopje; its meaning has been largely forgotten.<ref name=stapleton1to5>{{Harvnb
