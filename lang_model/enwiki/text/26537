[[Image:Tagesgang-luftdruck.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Diurnal (daily) rhythm of air pressure in northern Germany (black curve is air pressure)]]'''Atmospheric pressure''' is the [[pressure]] at any point in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. 
In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the [[Fluid pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] caused by the [[weight]] of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] above the measurement point. Low pressure areas have less atmospheric mass above their location, whereas high pressure areas have more atmospheric mass above their location. Similarly, as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that pressure decreases with increasing elevation. A column of air 1 square inch in cross section, measured from sea level to the top of the atmosphere, would weigh approximately 14.7 lb.  A 1 m<U+00B2> column of air would weigh about 100 [[kilonewton]]s. 

== Standard atmospheric pressure ==

'''[[Atmosphere (unit)|Standard atmosphere]]''' (symbol: atm) is a [[Units of pressure|unit of pressure]] and is defined as being precisely equal to 101,325 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]. This value is intended to represent the mean sea level pressure at the latitude of [[Paris|Paris, France]], and as a practical matter, approximates the mean sea level pressure for many of the industrialized nations (those with latitudes similar to Paris). One standard atmosphere is standard pressure used for pneumatic fluid power (ISO R554), and in the aerospace (ISO 2533) and petroleum (ISO 5024) industries. 

In 1982,  the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances, <U+201C>''the standard pressure''<U+201D> should be defined as precisely 100&nbsp;kPa (&asymp;750.062&nbsp;[[torr]]) rather than the 101.325&nbsp;kPa value of <U+201C>one standard atmosphere<U+201D>.<ref>IUPAC.org, Publications, ''Standard Pressure'' (''[http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05921.pdf 20&nbsp;kB PDF]'')</ref> This value is used as the standard pressure for the compressor and the pneumatic tool industries (ISO 2787).<ref>Compressor.co.za, ''[http://www.compressor.co.za/news/may%20news.htm May 2003 Newsletter]''</ref> (see also [[Standard temperature and pressure]])

In the [[United States]], compressed air flow is often measured in "standard cubic feet" per unit of time, where the "standard" means the equivalent quantity of air at standard temperature and pressure. However, this standard atmosphere is defined slightly differently: temperature = 68 <U+00B0>F (20 <U+00B0>C), air density = 0.075 lb/ft<U+00B3> (1.29 kg/m<U+00B3>), altitude = sea level, and relative humidity = 0%. In the air conditioning industry, the standard is often temperature = 32 <U+00B0>F (0 <U+00B0>C) instead. For natural gas, the petroleum industry uses a standard temperature of 60 <U+00B0>F (15.6 <U+00B0>C).

== Mean sea level pressure (MSLP or QFF) ==
[[Image:Mslp-jja-djf.png|thumb|right|15 year average MSLP for JJA (top) and DJF (bottom)<br>JJA: June July August<br>DJF: December January February]]

Mean sea level pressure (MSLP or QFF) is the pressure at sea level or (when measured at a given elevation on land) the station pressure reduced to sea level assuming an isothermal layer at the station temperature. 

This is the pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers. When barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure reduced to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.   See [[altimeter#BarometerVsAbsolute|Altimeter (barometer vs. absolute)]].

The reduction to sea level means that the ''normal range of fluctuations'' in pressure is the same for everyone. The pressures which are considered ''high pressure'' or ''low pressure'' do not depend on geographical location. This makes [[isobar]]s on a weather map meaningful and useful tools.

The '''altimeter setting''' in aviation, set either [[QNH]] or [[QFE]], is another atmospheric pressure reduced to sea level, but the method of making this reduction differs slightly. See [[altimeter]].
*'''QNH''' barometric altimeter setting which will cause the altimeter to read airfield elevation when on the airfield. In ISA temperature conditions the altimeter will read altitude above mean sea level in the vicinity of the airfield
*'''QFE''' barometric altimeter setting which will cause an altimeter to read zero when at the reference datum of a particular airfield (generally a runway threshold). In ISA temperature conditions the altimeter will read height above the datum in the vicinity of the airfield.

Average ''sea-level pressure'' is 1013.25 [[pascal (unit)|hPa]] (mbar) or 29.921 inches of mercury (inHg).  In aviation weather reports ([[METAR]]), QNH is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals, except in the United States and [[Canada]] where it is reported in inches (or hundredths of inches) of mercury. (The United States also reports ''sea level pressure'' SLP, which is reduced to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not an internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.  In Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is reported in kilopascals [http://www.cbc.ca/weather/conditions.jsp?station=YUL], while [[Environment Canada]]'s standard unit of pressure is the same [http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/trends_table/pages/yul_metric_e.html] [http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/forecast/trends_graph_e.html?yvr&unit=m].)  In the weather code, three digits are all that is needed,  Decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted:  1013.2 mbar or 101.32 kPa is transmitted as 132; 1000.0 mbar or 100.00 kPa is transmitted as 000; 998.7 mbar or 99.87 kPa is transmitted as 987; etc.  The highest ''sea-level pressure'' on Earth occurs in [[Siberia]], where the [[Siberian High]] often attains a ''sea-level pressure'' above 1032.0 mbar.  The lowest measurable ''sea-level pressure'' is found at the centers of hurricanes (typhoons, baguios)

== Altitude Atmospheric Pressure Variation ==

Pressure varies smoothly from the earth's surface to the top of the [[mesosphere]]. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. The following is a list of air pressures (as a fraction of one atmosphere) with the corresponding average altitude (in meters). The table gives a rough idea of air pressure at various altitudes. To find the pressure (in kPa or % atm) at any altitude (in feet or meters), you can use the [http://bpesoft.com/s/wleizero/xhac/?M=p eXtreme High Altitude Calculator]

== Local Atmospheric Pressure variation ==

[[Image:Wilma1315z-051019-1kg12.jpg||thumb|[[Hurricane Wilma]] on [[19 October]] [[2005]] &ndash; 88.2 kPa in eye]]

Atmospheric pressure varies widely on [[Earth]], and these changes are important in studying [[weather]] and [[climate]]. See [[pressure system]] for the effects of air pressure variations on weather.

The highest recorded atmospheric pressure, 108.6 kPa (1086 mbar or 32.06 inches of mercury), occurred at [[Tosontsengel, H<U+00F6>vsg<U+00F6>l|Tosontsengel]], [[Mongolia]], [[19 December]], [[2001]]<sup>[[#References|2]]</sup>.

The lowest recorded non-[[tornado|tornadic]] atmospheric pressure, 87.0 kPa (870 mbar or 25.69 inches of mercury), occurred in the Western Pacific during [[Typhoon]] [[Typhoon Tip|Tip]] on [[12 October]], [[1979]]<sup>[[#References|2]]</sup>. The record for the Atlantic ocean was 88.2 kPa (882 mbar or 26.04 inches of mercury) during [[Hurricane Wilma]] on [[19 October]] [[2005]].

Atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal (twice-daily) cycle caused by global atmospheric tides. This effect is strongest in tropical zones, with amplitude of a few millibars, and almost zero in polar areas. A graph on the top of this page shows these rhythmic variations in northern Europe. These variations have two superimposed cycles, a circadian (24 h) cycle and semi-circadian (12 h) cycle.

== Intuitive feeling for atmospheric pressure based on height of water ==

Atmospheric pressure is often measured with a mercury [[barometer]], and a height of approximately 760 mm (30 [[inch]]es) of mercury is often used to teach, make visible, and illustrate (and measure) atmospheric pressure.  However, since mercury is not a substance that humans commonly come in contact with, water often provides a more intuitive way to conceptualize the amount of pressure in one atmosphere.

One atmosphere (101.325 kPa or 14.7 lbf/in<U+00B2>) is the amount of pressure that can lift water approximately 10.3 m (33.9 feet).  Thus, a diver at a depth 10.3 meters under water in a fresh-water lake experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres (1 atm for the air and 1 atm for the water).

Non-professional [[barometer]]s are generally aneroid barometer (Figure 3) or [[strain gauge]] based. See [[Pressure measurement]] for a description of barometers.
