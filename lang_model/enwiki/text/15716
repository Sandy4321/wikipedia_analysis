'''Reverend Canon Percy Umfreville Henn''' (b. [[21 January]] [[1865]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]]; d. [[25 February]] [[1955]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]]) was a clergyman and teacher in [[England]] and later [[Western Australia]]. He is best known for his time as Headmaster at [[Guildford Grammar School]] and later for the building of the [[Guildford Grammar School Chapel|Chapel of SS. Mary and George]].<ref name="AustralianDictionaryofBiography">[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090269b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography listing for Henn, Percy Umfreville] (accessed 2007-03-04)</ref><ref name="AustLit">[http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A)%7BM AustLit Agent Listing for Percy Henn] (accessed 2007-03-04)</ref>

Henn gained his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1887 and [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] in 1890 from [[Worcester College]] at [[Oxford University]]. He taught at various schools until 1900, when he became a missionary in [[Western Australia]] in country towns. In Western Australia Henn married Jean Elliott and had four children. After further religious work in regional WA, he moved to [[Guildford, Western Australia]] and became a leading force behind [[Guildford Grammar School]]'s [[Guildford Grammar School Chapel|chapel]] and preparatory school. He died in 1955 at age 90.

== Early years ==
Henn was the tenth child of Rev. John Henn and his wife Catherine, n<U+00E9>e Holcroft. Born in [[Manchester]], [[England]] in 1865, he was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]], [[London, England|London]] as a Bluecoat Boy and then at [[Worcester College]], [[Oxford]] on a scholarship. Henn considered taking holy orders after gaining two qualifications: a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1887) and a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] (1890).<ref name="AustralianDictionaryofBiography"/>

== Early career ==
Henn decided, before taking on a spiritual career, that he would become a teacher. He began his career as an assistant master at [[Hurstpierpoint College]], [[West Sussex]] (one of the Woodard Schools, a series of eleven schools founded by Nathaniel Woodard). There, he became interested in education through religion, and became an ordained priest in 1891. He then became Chaplain at Hurstpierpoint in 1892.<ref name="AustralianDictionaryofBiography"/> Henn became recognised as a teacher when he became a founding headmaster at [[Worksop College]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]; however he resigned in 1899 amidst differences with a new superior who disagreed with Henn's philosophy of a school grounds with beautiful buildings dominated by a chapel.<ref name="AustralianDictionaryofBiography"/><ref name="heritageregister">[http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/G%20-%20A-D/Guildford%20Gram%20Chapel(I-AD).PDF Register of Heritage Places - Assessment Documentation] - Guildford Grammar School Chapel (accessed 2007-12-10)</ref>

== Looking abroad ==
In January 1900, Henn arrived as a missionary in [[Perth, Western Australia]]. After a short spell in [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], he moved to [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] as [[rector]] ([[parish]] [[priest]]). On [[3 April]] [[1902]], in [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]], Henn married Jean Elliott and they eventually had four children together. Henn became a [[rector]] in [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]] for three years (1902-1905), signifying the end of his missionary term. He returned to [[England]] and became organising secretary in the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the dioceses of Canterbury and Rochester.<ref name="AustralianDictionaryofBiography"/>[[Image:Henn's Father.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Revd.

== Return to Western Australia ==
===A Chapel for Guildford===
In 1910, Henn returned to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to take up the position of Headmaster of [[Guildford Grammar School]].<ref name="GGSArchives"/> His task was to oversee the first attempt by the [[Church of England]] at [[secondary education]] since 1873. His first thought for the new school was the provision of a chapel. To him, a Church school without a chapel was "like the play of [[Hamlet]] without the Prince of Denmark." Henn immediately sent out a circular entitled "A Church of England Secondary School for Western Australia." This circular fell into the hands of one Cecil H. Oliverson, whom Henn eventually persuaded to pay the full cost of the Chapel, the [[Guildford Grammar School Chapel|Chapel of SS. Mary and George]].

===Relations with Christ Church Grammar School===
In 1918, [[Guildford Grammar School]] and [[Christ Church Grammar School]] were placed under the same ruling council. Henn became a member immediately; however, Christ Church did not gain representation until 1920.<ref name="CCGSFoundersDay"/><ref name="ALifeSoRich"/> In 1918, Henn suggested that [[Christ Church Grammar School]]'s oval be widened and made a first-class playing field.<ref name="CCGSFoundersDay">

=== Guildford Preparatory School ===
In 1912, a Cecil Priestley was temporarily employed by Henn as a member of the [[Guildford Grammar School]] staff. It seems today that he conceived the idea of a Guildford Preparatory School. Henn was enthusiastic about this, however the Guildford Preparatory School did not integrate with the main [[Guildford Grammar School|Grammar School]] until 1921, when it became [[Guildford Grammar Preparatory School]], and Priestley resigned from his position as the Head of the Prep School around this time.<ref name="ALifeSoRich">Henn, Wilfrid E. ''A Life So Rich'', March 1973 (accessed 2007-03-04 at the [[Alexander Library Building|J.S. Battye Library, Perth, Western Australia]].</ref>

Henn became [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St George's Cathedral, Perth]] in 1921.<ref name="ALifeSoRich"/> He has a [[Guildford Grammar School]] house named after him, Henn's House, founded 1927.<ref name="GGSArchives">''Guildford Grammar School Archives'', accessed 2007-03-07.</ref>

== 1925 - death ==
Henn left his job as Headmaster at [[Guildford Grammar School]] in 1925 and returned to [[England]]. However, he could not be kept away from Western Australia and returned again to become founding warden of [[University of Western Australia|St. Georges College]], within the [[University of Western Australia]]. Henn retired permanently to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1933 and died in 1955, age 90. Henn's ashes reside in the [[Guildford Grammar School Chapel]], with a stone slab to commemorate this situated on the north side of the sanctuary.<ref name="AustralianDictionaryofBiography"/>
