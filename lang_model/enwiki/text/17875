'''Blackpool North railway station''' is the terminus of the main [[Blackpool Branch Lines|Blackpool branch line]] from [[Preston railway station|Preston]], in [[Lancashire]], [[England]]. Services from [[York]] and [[Leeds]] (via Burnley), [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]] terminate here. 

The station was opened in its present form in 1974, and succeeded a previous station a few hundred yards away on Talbot Road which had first opened in 1846 and had been rebuilt in 1898. The present station is based on the 1938 concrete canopy which covered the entrance to the former excursion platforms of the old station.
 
Blackpool North was on the [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] network until 2003 when [[Virgin Trains]] withdrew [[HST]] and [[British Rail Class 220|Voyager]] services to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] and [[Birmingham]].<ref>

The resort's other terminus station, [[Blackpool South railway station|Blackpool South]], is situated at the end of the South Fylde branch line, and does not connect to Blackpool North. 

As [[Blackpool]] is a popular [[tourist]] [[resort]], with its famous [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach|Pleasure Beach]] and beaches, there are many measures put in to prevent fare evasion, including automated barrier checks<ref>

==History==

The first station opened on [[29 April]] [[1846]] as '''Talbot Road''', and was first rebuilt in 1898. The rebuilt station consisted of two parallel train sheds and a terminal building, in Dickson Road between Talbot Road and Queen Street. Platforms 1 to 6 were located in the sheds, with a larger island between platforms 1 and 2 to accommodate taxis. In addition, there was effectively, in all but name, a separate station at the east end of Queen Street, with open "excursion" platforms 7 to 16, used only in summer.<ref>Taylor, S. (2005) ''Kirkham to Blackpool (North) and Fleetwood for the Isle of Man'', Foxline, Bredbury, ISBN 1 801197 74 6, pp.51&ndash;52, 56, 59, 75&ndash;76</ref> In 1974 the main station was demolished, replaced by the current station based on the former excursion platforms.
