In [[mathematics]], the '''affinely extended real number system''' is obtained from the [[real number]] system '''R''' by adding two elements: +<U+221E> and <U+2212><U+221E> (read as '''positive [[infinity]]''' and '''negative infinity''' respectively). The '''projective extended real number system''' adds a single object, <U+221E> (infinity) and makes no distinction between "positive" or "negative" infinity. These new elements are not real numbers. It is useful in describing various [[limit of a function|limiting behavior]]s in [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]], especially in the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[integral|integration]]. The affinely extended real number system is denoted '''{{Overline|R}}''' or [<U+2212><U+221E>, +<U+221E>].

When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol +<U+221E> is often written simply as <U+221E>.

==Motivation==
===Limits===

We often wish to describe the behavior of a function ''f''(''x''), as either the argument ''x'' or the function value ''f''(''x'') gets "very big" in some sense. For example, consider the function

:<math>f(x) = x^{-2}.</math>

The graph of this function has a horizontal [[asymptote]] at ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. Geometrically, as we move farther and farther to the right along the ''x''-axis, the value of 1/''x''<sup>2</sup> approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the [[limit of a function]] at a [[real number]], except that there is no real number to which ''x'' approaches.

By adjoining the elements +<U+221E> and <U+2212><U+221E> to '''R''', we allow a formulation of a "limit at infinity" with [[topology|topological]] properties similar to those for '''R'''.

To make things completely formal, the [[Cauchy sequences]] definition of '''R''' allows us to define +<U+221E> as the set of all sequences of rationals which, for any K>0, from some point on exceed K. We can define <U+2212><U+221E> similarly.

===Measure and integration===

In [[measure theory]], it is often useful to allow sets which have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.

Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] to '''R''' that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering infinite integrals, such as

:<math>\int_1^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x}</math>

the value "infinity" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as

:<math>f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 2n(1-nx), & \mbox{if } 0 \le x \le \frac{1}{n} \\ 0, & \mbox{if } \frac{1}{n} < x \le 1\end{cases}</math>

Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the [[monotone convergence theorem]] and the [[dominated convergence theorem]] would not make sense.

==Order and topological properties==

The affinely extended real number system turns into a [[totally ordered set]] by defining <U+2212><U+221E> <U+2264> ''a'' <U+2264> +<U+221E> for all ''a''. This order has the desirable property that every subset has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]: it is a [[complete lattice]].

This induces the [[order topology]] on '''{{Overline|R}}'''. In this topology, a set ''U'' is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of +<U+221E> if and only if it contains a set {''x'' : ''x'' > ''a''} for some real number ''a'', and analogously for the neighborhoods of <U+2212><U+221E>. '''{{Overline|R}}''' is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[unit interval]] [0, 1]. Thus the topology is [[metrizable]], corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric which is an extension of the ordinary metric on '''R'''.

With this topology the specially defined [[Limit of a function|limits]] for ''x'' tending to +<U+221E> and <U+2212><U+221E>, and the specially defined concepts of limits equal to +<U+221E> and <U+2212><U+221E>, reduce to the general topological definitions of limits.

==Arithmetic operations==

The arithmetic operations of '''R''' can be partially extended to '''{{Overline|R}}''' as follows:

:<math>
\begin{align}
a + \infty = +\infty + a & = +\infty, & a & \neq -\infty \\
a - \infty = -\infty + a & = -\infty, & a & \neq +\infty \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a & = \pm\infty, & a & \in (0, +\infty] \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a & = \mp\infty, & a & \in [-\infty, 0) \\
\frac{a}{\pm\infty} & = 0, & a & \in \mathbb{R} \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} & = \pm\infty, & a & \in \mathbb{R}^+ \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} & = \mp\infty, & a & \in \mathbb{R}^-
\end{align}
</math>

Here, "''a'' + <U+221E>" means both "''a'' + (+<U+221E>)" and "''a'' <U+2212> (<U+2212><U+221E>)", and "''a'' <U+2212> <U+221E>" means both "''a'' <U+2212> (+<U+221E>)" and "''a'' + (<U+2212><U+221E>)".

The expressions <U+221E> <U+2212> <U+221E>, 0 <U+00D7> (<U+00B1><U+221E>) and <U+00B1><U+221E> / <U+00B1><U+221E> (called [[indeterminate form]]s) are usually left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]]. These rules are modeled on the laws for [[Limit_of_a_function#Limit_of_a_function_at_infinity|infinite limits]]. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, 0 <U+00D7> (<U+00B1><U+221E>) is often defined as 0.

The expression 1/0 is not defined either as +<U+221E> or <U+2212><U+221E>, because although it is true that whenever ''f''(''x'') <U+2192> 0 for a [[continuous function]] ''f''(''x'') it must be the case that 1/''f''(''x'') is eventually contained in every [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the set {<U+2212><U+221E>, +<U+221E>}, it is ''not'' true that 1/''f''(''x'') must tend to one of these points. An example is ''f''(''x'') = 1/(sin(1/''x'')). (Its [[absolute value|modulus]] 1/|&thinsp;''f''(''x'')&thinsp;|, nevertheless, does approach +<U+221E>.)

==Algebraic properties==

With these definitions '''{{Overline|R}}''' is '''not''' a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and not even a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. However, it still has several convenient properties:
* ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') and (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' are either equal or both undefined.
* ''a'' + ''b'' and ''b'' + ''a'' are either equal or both undefined.
* ''a'' <U+00D7> (''b'' <U+00D7> ''c'') and (''a'' <U+00D7> ''b'') <U+00D7> ''c'' are either equal or both undefined.
* ''a'' <U+00D7> ''b'' and ''b'' <U+00D7> ''a'' are either equal or both undefined
* ''a'' <U+00D7> (''b'' + ''c'') and  (''a'' <U+00D7> ''b'') + (''a'' <U+00D7> ''c'') are equal if both are defined.
* if ''a'' <U+2264> ''b'' and if both ''a'' + ''c'' and ''b'' + ''c'' are defined, then ''a'' + ''c'' <U+2264> ''b'' + ''c''.
* if ''a'' <U+2264> ''b'' and ''c'' > 0  and both ''a'' <U+00D7> ''c'' and ''b'' <U+00D7> ''c'' are defined, then ''a'' <U+00D7> ''c'' <U+2264> ''b'' <U+00D7> ''c''.

In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in '''{{Overline|R}}''' as long as all occurring expressions are defined.

==Miscellaneous==

Several [[function (mathematics)|functions]] can be [[continuity (topology)|continuously]] extended to '''{{Overline|R}}''' by taking limits. For instance, one defines [[exponential function|exp]](<U+2212><U+221E>) = 0, exp(+<U+221E>) = +<U+221E>, [[natural logarithm|ln]](0) = <U+2212><U+221E>, ln(+<U+221E>) = +<U+221E> etc.

Some discontinuities may additionally be removed. For example, the function 1/''x''<sup>2</sup> can be made continuous (under ''some'' definitions of continuity) by setting the value to +<U+221E> for ''x'' = 0, and 0 for ''x'' = +<U+221E> and ''x'' = <U+2212><U+221E>. The function 1/''x'' can ''not'' be made continuous because the function approaches <U+2212><U+221E> as ''x'' approaches 0 from below, and +<U+221E> as ''x'' approaches 0 from above.

Compare the [[real projective line]], which does not distinguish between +<U+221E> and <U+2212><U+221E>. As a result, on one hand a function may have limit <U+221E> on the real projective line, while in the affinely extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function 1/''x'' at ''x'' = 0. On the other hand
:<math>\lim_{x \to -\infty}{f(x)}</math> and <math>\lim_{x \to +\infty}{f(x)}</math>
correspond on the real projective line to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus  e<sup>''x''</sup> and arctan(''x'') cannot be made continuous at ''x'' = <U+221E> on the real projective line.
