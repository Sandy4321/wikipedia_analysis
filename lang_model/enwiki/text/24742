"Homer Alone" was written by [[David M. Stern]]. He had noticed that most of the writers were pitching stories about Bart and Homer, and he thought a "deeper vein of comedy" could be reached by having Marge suffer from a nervous breakdown.<ref name="Castellaneta">Castellaneta, Dan. (2003). Commentary for "Homer Alone", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] immediately approved the idea.<ref name="Jean">Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for "Homer Alone", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Originally, Marge's trip was to a distressed mother's institute so they could show "what made Marge tick." However, the plot was not well-received at the [[table read]] for the episode. The writers then re-wrote much of the episode, switching the institute to a spa.<ref name="Castellaneta"/> They also added a video appearance from the fictional actor [[Troy McClure]], voiced by [[Phil Hartman]]. According to executive producer [[Al Jean]], the writers often used McClure as a "panic button" when they felt an episode needed more humor.<ref name="Jean"/> The episode's title references the movie ''[[Home Alone]]''; David Stern's brother [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel]] had starred in the movie as one of the main antagonists.<ref name="Jean"/>

The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. The scene at the train station where Marge leaves for Rancho Relaxo includes a brief cameo appearance of a character modeled after ''Simpsons'' director [[Jim Reardon]]. Reardon dislikes flying, and took trains whenever possible, so the animators always tried to include him in scenes at a train station.<ref name="Kirkland">Kirkland, Mark. (2003). Commentary for "Homer Alone", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> [[Susie Dietter]] served as assistant director for the episode and animated several of the scenes for the subplot with Bart, Lisa, Patty and Selma.<ref name="Kirkland"/> In a scene where Homer sings a song to Maggie, he was designed to look dischevelled because the writers had wanted him to look drunk, although no attention was called to it.<ref name="Kirkland"/>

==Cultural references==
The beginning of the episode where Homer chases Bart is a reference to the [[Warner Brothers]] [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] cartoons. The scene freezes, during which Bart and Homer's [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] are given as Brat'us Don'thaveacow'us and Homo Neanderthal'us respectively.<ref name="BBC"/> The background in the sequence references the [[Hanna<U+2013>Barbera]] tradition of using backgrounds over and over and making it look like there is an "endless living room."<ref name="Bird">Bird, Brad. (2003). Commentary for "Homer Alone", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The scene where Marge is booked in prison references the [[Coen brothers]] film ''[[Raising Arizona]]''.<ref name="Castellaneta"/> The song that plays while Homer is on hold on the missing child hotline is "[[Baby Come Back (Player song)|Baby Come Back]]" by [[Player (band)|Player]].<ref name="BBC"/> One of the films available at Rancho Relaxo is ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'', which Marge ends up watching.<ref name="BBC"/> "Homer Alone" is the first episode of ''The Simpsons'' that shows Patty and Selma's fondness for ''[[MacGyver]]'', and Selma says "[[Richard Dean Anderson]] will be in my dreams tonight."<ref name="BBC"/>

==Reception==
In its original airing on February 6, 1992 on the Fox network during [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|February sweeps]], the episode acquired a 14.2 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] and was viewed in approximately 13.08 million homes. It finished 25th in the ratings for the week of February 3<U+2013>9, 1992, up from the season's average rank of 37th.<ref name="Nielsen">{{cite news|title=Nielsen Ratings/Feb. 3<U+2013>9|date=1992-02-20|author=The Associated Press|work=[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]}}</ref> ''The Simpsons'' was the highest rated show on Fox that week.<ref>{{Cite news|title=CBS brings home ratings Gold with Olympics, '60 Minutes'|work=[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]|date=1992-02-12|author=The Associated Press}}</ref>

Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from critics.  The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, "After the first few minutes, this episode becomes less about Marge than the family's reliance on her. Bart and Lisa's torturous time at Patty and Selma's is wonderful [...], but it's Homer losing Maggie, and working out what to tell Marge upon her return, that provides the best jokes."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson felt that the episode "comes close to finding the series in a rut, as it sort of offers another iteration of the 'Homer's a bad father' theme. However, the emphasis on Marge's issues makes it different, and it's also fun to see life at Patty and Selma's place. It's another solid show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthree.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season (1991) |last=Jacobson|first=Colin|date=2003-08-21|publisher=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode 3/5, writing, "The episode serves only to demonstrate what is already obvious: that Marge holds the family together. It's entertaining to see Homer struggle with the most basic of parenting skills, but this happens at the expense of all the other episodes this season that show him to be a good father (albeit flawed). Still, it's nice to see Marge get her own show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6129|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season|last=Meyers|first=Nate|date=2004-06-23|publisher=Digitally Obsessed|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>
