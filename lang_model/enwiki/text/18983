The [[Detroit Lions]] drafted Orlovsky in the fifth round (145th overall) of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at the [[UConn Huskies football|University of Connecticut]].

==Early years==
Born in Connecticut, Orlovsky played high school football. "When I was younger, I would have garbage cans set up all around the yard," Orlovsky recalled. "And I would have like 20 balls and just fire them into the cans. I really had nothing else to do back then."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourct.com/sportsnews/1912/ |title=The Passer: Dan Orlovsky state's best QB |publisher=YourCT.com |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}</ref> 

Dan was also a pitcher for the Shelton National All-Star [[Little League]]; the team competed in the [[Little League World Series]], losing in the [[New England]] regional playoffs.

Orlovsky attended [[Shelton High School (Connecticut)|Shelton High School]] and became the starting quarterback during his sophomore year.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20081013/SPORTS01/810130352/1049 ]{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref>  As a senior, he threw for 2,489 yards and 58 touchdowns as the Gaels went 12-0, winning the state championship. His overall record as a high school quarterback was 28-4. He earned [[All-American]] honors from Prep Football Report, SuperPrep and Prep Star, and was also named Connecticut all-state, Class LL MVP, the [[New Haven Register]]'s Connecticut Player of the Year and winner of the McHugh Award. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwasallstate.com/FallSports/Football/FootballAllStateTeams/2000s/2000/tabid/116/Default.aspx |title=2000 New Haven Register All-State Football Team |publisher=Iwasallstate.com |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}</ref>

Despite offers from [[Purdue]] and [[Michigan State]], Orlovsky committed to play at Connecticut, where he wanted the challenge of elevating the Huskies into a Big East contender.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==College career==

He became the starter during his freshman year when Keron Henry suffered a hip injury. Orlovsky threw for 1,379 yards and nine touchdowns on 128 of 269 passing (47.6 percent) while being intercepted 11 times.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Starting every game as a sophomore, Orlovsky hit on 221 of 366 attempts (60.4 percent), with 19 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. His 2,488 yards passing rank fourth on the school's season-record list.

As a junior, he ranked seventh in the nation in passing, hitting on 279 of 475 passes (58.7 percent) for 3,485 yards, 33 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. His 33 scoring tosses ranked fifth in the NCAA Division I-A ranks.
 
Orlovsky did not match his 2003 figures as a senior, but guided the team to victory in its inaugural bowl appearance. He gained 3,354 yards with 23 touchdowns and 15 interceptions on 288 of 456 throws (63.0 percent) in 2004.
 
Orlovsky holds the school record for most pass completions (916), pass attempts (1,567), yards passing (10,706), touchdown passes (84), interceptions (51), total plays (1,710) and total yards (10,421).

Orlovsky, along with head coach [[Randy Edsall]], served as the "face" of the UConn football program durings the early 2000s.<ref>http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15118604.html</ref>  Orlovsky was the starting quarterback during the Huskies transitional period from [[Division I-AA]] football, to independent [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] team, to full fledged member of the [[Big East]].

==Professional career==
===Detroit Lions===
When [[Jeff Garcia]] went down with an injury in the '05 preseason, Orlovsky emerged as the Lions' primary backup. He played in two regular season contests in 2005, including the nationally-televised [[Thanksgiving]] Day game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. In the two contests combined, Orlovsky completed 7-of-17 passes for 63 yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions.

Prior to the 2006 season the Lions traded [[Joey Harrington]] and released [[Jeff Garcia]], while signing [[Jon Kitna]] and [[Josh McCown]]. Orlovsky spent the 2006 season as the third-string QB. Orlovsky was projected to be the second-string quarterback in 2007 because [[Drew Stanton]], who was picked in the second round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]], was placed on [[injured reserve]]; however, the Lions acquired [[J. T. O'Sullivan]], who bumped Orlovsky back to third on the depth chart. Orlovsky did not take a regular season snap in either 2006 or 2007; in 2008, O'Sullivan went to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and emerged as the starting QB there.

On September 15 against the [[Green Bay Packers]], he finished the game, completing two of four attempts for six yards.

Orlovsky made his first career NFL start on October 12, 2008, in a 12-10 Lions loss against the Minnesota Vikings. He completed 12 of 21 passes for 150 yards, with one touchdown and no turnovers.  However, he inadvertently ran out of the back of his own end zone for a safety early in the first quarter, in what turned out to be the margin of victory.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80b8de5f Orlovsky ran out of the back of his own end zone]</ref>  "When they started blowing the whistle, I was like, 'Did we false start, or were they offsides or something?'" Orlovsky said. "And I looked, and I was just like, 'You're an idiot.'"<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20081013/SPORTS01/810130352/1049 Orlovsky red-faced, but confident in Lions.]{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref>

Orlovsky also started the final game of the 2008 season, but was unable to lead his team to their first victory of the season; the Lions finished 0-16. Orlovsky announced his intention to explore the free agent market at the end of the 2008 season rather than accept a contract as a backup quarterback in Detroit.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090223/ap_on_sp_fo_ne/fbn_lions_orlovsky;_ylt=Aiy.5Fw845COb6IBEy81r2cLMxIF Orlovsy Plans to Enter Free Agency] Yahoo Sports, February 23, 2009</ref>

===Houston Texans===
He signed with the Houston Texans for a 3 year, 9 million dollar deal on March 1, 2009. He was beaten out by [[Rex Grossman]] for the backup quarterback position during the preseason, Orlovsky will serve as the Texans number three quarterback.
