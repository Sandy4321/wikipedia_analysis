'''Doctor Paul Browning''' is a [[fictional character]] from the British [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by Joe Thompson. He made his debut screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 2012 and was introduced by [[Emma Smithwick]]. Doctor Browning was introduced as part of a storyline featuring [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) in which he "shows her the benefits of 'selling her services'". Doctor Browning and Mercedes later begin a relationship, which Smithwick called a "union of the dark soul mates". Thompson said that Doctor Browning and Mercedes "are excited by how dangerous the other is" and are "kindred spirits" who have an "undeniable connection between them". When [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) is murdered in a [[whodunit]] plot Doctor Browning becomes a suspect before it is later revealed he had killed Lynsey. Doctor Browning is described as having an "incredible capacity for Sleaze" and as someone who "needs to be in control and is not afraid to use underhand tactics". 

Thompson was nominated in the "Newcomer" category at the 2013 [[National Television Awards]]. Laura Morgan of ''[[All About Soap]]'' felt that Doctor Browning was an "obvious suspect" in the investigation for Lynsey's murder although ''[[Inside Soap]]'' journalist Sarah was shocked at the revelation of Doctor Browning as Lynsey's killer, saying she had overlooked him as a suspect. Anthony D. Langford from [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton]] hoped that the character would not be revealed to be Lynsey's killer due to his enjoyment of Doctor Browning's relationship with Mercedes and their "blistering chemistry".

==Casting and creation==
On 19 December 2011, [[Digital Spy]] announced the introduction of the character saying that a "charming doctor arrives on the scene" during a new storyline featuring [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]).<ref name=spoilers>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' 2012 spoilers: Nancy, Darren, Mercedes|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a356735/hollyoaks-2012-spoilers-nancy-darren-mercedes.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> It was later announced that Doctor Browning would return with Mercedes to be "heading back into the arms of sleazy Doctor Browning again".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Mercedes to get Riley, Lynsey shock|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a382965/hollyoaks-mercedes-to-get-riley-lynsey-shock.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines]])|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref>

===Characterisation===
The official ''Hollyoaks''{{'}} website describes Doctor Browning as being "affectionately known as 'Doctor Sleaze'", explaining that he has an "incredible capacity for Sleaze". They add that the character's "driving motivation is his obsession with Mercedes. He's a man who needs to be in control and is not afraid to use underhand tactics to assert his power over the situation".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Paul Browning (Played by Joseph Thompson)|url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/boys/doctorbrowning.html|work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]]|publisher=([[Channel Four Television Corporation]])|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> Jaci Stephen of the the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' called him a "caring doctor"<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Jaci|title=SOAP WATCH: The ultimate insight into this week's soaps|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2175900/SOAP-WATCH-The-ultimate-insight-weeks-soaps.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=20 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> but later dubbed the character "Doctor Dubious".<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Jaci|title=SOAP WATCH: The ultimate insight into the week's soaps|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2189185/Soap-operas-Insight-EastEnders-Hollyoaks-Coronation-Street-more.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|date=17 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> Doctor Browning has also been labelled a "grade A nutcase",<ref name=tvtimes>{{cite journal |last=Slade|first=Alison|title=Bad Medicine!

Mercedes does not take money from Doctor Browning for sex this time although she "hates herself" for it.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brockway|first=Sally|title=Killer blow for Mercy!|journal=[[Soaplife]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=26 May- 8 June 2012|issue=277|pages=34<U+2013>35|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Metcalfe told Katy Moon from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that their night together makes her character "feel awful but she's looking for any distraction, any way to escape her demons".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moon|first=Katy|title=Mercedes' meltdown|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=26 May - 1 June 2012|issue=21|pages=21|accessdate=29 August 2012|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}</ref> Metcalfe told a journalist from [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun's]] magazine ''TV Buzz'' that Mercedes believes Doctor Browning "will help her move on" from her ordeal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Inside Story With...

She branded Thompson a "really good addition" to the cast and revealed that he had returned for a longer second stint, which sees Doctor Browning "stir things up".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Exclusive: 'Hollyoaks' Jennifer Metcalfe talks Mercedes stabbing aftermath|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a389900/hollyoaks-jennifer-metcalfe-talks-mercedes-stabbing-aftermath.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=26 June 2012}}</ref> ''Hollyoaks'' producer [[Emma Smithwick]] said that she was initially nervous about the "union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Exclusive: 'Hollyoaks' producer Emma Smithwick shares show gossip, teasers|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a400937/hollyoaks-producer-emma-smithwick-shares-show-gossip-teasers.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Mercedes begins to "fall for the charms" of Doctor Browning, believing she has "landed on her feet" when he invites her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes begins to think he could provide her with the [[WAG]] life style she has always wanted. She added that Mercedes still wants Riley but she "craves a bit of danger".<ref name=tvtimes /> Thompson also commented on this, saying Doctor Browning offers an "exciting alternative" for Merceds compared to Riley. On the relationship Thompson said: "He knows what makes her tick, and the two of them are excited by how dangerous the other is". He went on to explain that Doctor Browning initially agreed to pretend to be in a relationship with Mercedes to help make Riley jealous but "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around".<ref name=insidesoap /> When Doctor Browning sees Riley kiss Mercedes "it becomes a question of how much he can take" and he decides he must "make a quick move" to prevent them reuniting. He takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are "kindred spirits" and Mercedes spending time with him will make her rethink their relationship.<ref name=insidesoap /> To dissuade Riley from reuniting with Mercedes Doctor Browning gets Riley intoxicated and then warns him off of Mercedes. Thompson said that "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen".<ref name=insidesoap /> Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence on Mercedes he has "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..."<ref name=insidesoap />

===Murder of Lynsey Nolan===
Lynsey is found dead by [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]).

==Storylines==
He appears after he pays Mercedes for sex. He then asks to keep seeing her and gives her more money. When Lynsey resuscitates a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] patient; Doctor Browning tells her that the department are investigating the incident, he admits he forgot to write the patient's DNR request on their notes. He threatens to report Lynsey and Mercedes tries to convince him not to. Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning is married and threatens to tell his wife of their relationship if Doctor Browning reports Lynsey for resuscitating the DNR patient. He later promises not to report Lynsey who is later given her job back as a nurse. Mercedes later calls Dr Browning and arranges a meeting. She sleeps with him again for money and the next day he goads Lynsey about it. She warns him to stay away from her because Mercedes is not well and accuses him of taking advangtage. He later treats [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) for her burn injuries and catches Lynsey attempting to view [[#Walker|Walker's]] ([[Neil Newbon]]) medical records.

After discharging Mercedes from hospital, Lynsey is found dead and Doctor Browning confirms her time of death. He forges Mercedes' discharge papers so it appears as though she left hospital after Lynsey's murder. He moves into the flat next door to [[Riley Costello]] (Rob Norbury) to be closer to Mercedes. He blackmails Mercedes with the papers and tells her that she can make Riley jealous if they pretend to be in a relationship. His wife, Helen Browning visits Mercedes and warns her that Doctor Browning will ruin her life. She has a black eye and Mercedes uses this to give Riley the impression that Doctor Browning has been hitting her. He tells Riley that Mercedes is lying and she leaves him. Doctor Browning finds Mercedes and they share their secrets about bad deeds. He tells her that he loves her no matter what she has done and they become closer. [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) discovers Lynsey's scarf in his office desk and assumes that he is the killer. It is later revealed that Doctor Browning went to threaten Lynsey into keeping quiet about Mercedes stalking Mitzeee. They argued and he strangled her, not knowing that Walker was watching. When Mercedes finds out the truth, Doctor Browning kidnaps her and drives off. He suggests that they go abroad and Mercedes agrees, but the police arrive and arrest him.

==Reception==
For his role as Doctor Browning, Joseph Thompson was nominated in the "Newcomer" category at the 2013 [[National Television Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=National Television Awards 2013: Longlist nominations in full - vote|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a407475/national-television-awards-2013-longlist-nominations-in-full-vote.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=22 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Jaci Stephen of the ''Daily Mail'' pondered whether "Dr Browning ever do a full day<U+2019>s work of, well, doctoring? While the rest of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] claims to be underpaid and overworked, Dr Browning is having a breeze. If ever he has the incentive to write a prescription, please put out the bunting".<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Jaci|title=SOAP WATCH: The ultimate insight into the week's soaps |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2186126/Soap-operas-Insight-EastEnders-Hollyoaks-Coronation-Street-more.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> Stephen's colleague, Claudia Connel felt that soap operas could help give [[David Cameron]] ideas to improve the NHS, noting that "Dr Browning in Hollyoaks is even good enough to leave his office unlocked so patients can help themselves to whatever they fancy. Drugs? A butcher<U+2019>s at someone else<U+2019>s medical notes? Fill your boots".<ref>{{cite web|last=Connell|first=Claudia|title=SOAP WATCH: Claudia Connell's ultimate insight into this week's soaps|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2195866/SOAP-WATCH-Claudia-Connells-ultimate-insight-weeks-soaps.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|date=31 August 2012|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> 

Laura Morgan of ''[[All About Soap]]'' felt that Doctor Browning is "dodgy" and that he is a "fairly obvious suspect" in the investigation for Lynsey's murder. She added that Doctor Browning "might not be a murderer, but you can't deny there's something not right about the preying practitioner". Morgan explained that Doctor Browning has a hold over Mercedes due to him having proof Mercedes was in the village when Lynsey was killed although she though that Doctor Browning "could he be trying to cover his own tracks by shifting the blame onto someone else". Morgan went on to say that after Doctor Browning sees through Mercedes scheme to solve the problem, "the devilish doc advised Mercedes she was better to keep him on side [...] we<U+2019>re going to see a lot more of Dr Browning in the next few weeks. There<U+2019>s going to be some interesting clues about his past, but will any of these lead us to be convinced he<U+2019>s a cold-blooded killer?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Laura|title=Hollyoaks: Dr Browning Is Dodgy!|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/hollyoaks-dr-browning-is-dodgy/|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=12 July 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> Morgan's ''All About Soap'' colleague Carena Crowford felt that was "something suspect" about Doctor Browning. She said Silas was left alone with "the dodgy doc, and the next thing they knew the old man had knocked Browning out, stolen his shoes and run away. Come on, are we really expected to believe Silas could take out young, strong Dr B alone? Or is this evidence they<U+2019>re working together...?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Crowford|first=Carena|title=Hollyoaks: Silas Has Escaped!|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/hollyoaks-silas-has-escaped/|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> After it was revealed Doctor Browning killed Lynsey, Morgan said she "had the dastardly doc's card marked from day one, but have to admit that tonight's big reveal has left us a bit cold". She said that the murder was "a crime of passion, but there<U+2019>s no way Mercy is worth killing for. [...] Disappointingly, it also transpired that Dr Browning has zilch to do with Silas's epic return. It was a mere coincidence that the medical man was caught up in the serial killer<U+2019>s escape from hospital. We think it could have made a brilliant twist if Silas had been schooling Dr B, and getting him to carry on his work while he was behind bars".<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Laura|title=Hollyoaks: Dr Browning Did It!|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/hollyoaks-dr-browning-did-it/|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> 

''[[Inside Soap]]'' journalist Sarah commented Lynsey's killer is revealed to be "none other than dodgy Dr Browning! Who saw that one coming?" She went on to add that her colleague had guessed the "menacing medic" to be responsible for the "despicable act" but because Doctor Browning was not one of the original suspects listed she had overlooked him as a suspect.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lynsey<U+2019>s Killer Revealed!|url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/inside-story/lynseys-killer-revealed.html|work=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> Anthony D. Langford from [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton]] praised Doctor Browning's relationship with Mercedes, saying he is "loving the dysfunctional affair between Mercedes and the bad Dr. Browning. Their scenes are hot and they are so suited for each other. The games they play with each other are a hoot. I pray he's not Lynsey's killer".<ref>{{cite web|last=D.

He went on to comment that it had previously "mattered little" to him that Doctor Browning could be responsible for the murder "but over the past several weeks, much has changed. The more I got to see the good doctor and his blistering chemistry with Mercedes, the more I liked him. Yes, the doctor is a bit twisted and a bad boy, but he was perfect for a twisted girl like Mercedes. I loved their scenes <U+2014> they were hot, hot, hot. I really thought they made a delicious and fun couple. But now it<U+2019>s all ruined with Browning being a killer".<ref>{{cite web|last=D.
