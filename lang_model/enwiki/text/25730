She had a rude awakening when she was mugged in 1999, and fun-loving Lilly was never quite the same again.

==Storylines==
Lilly was a former hoofer with the Westwood Girls (a showgirl), performing throughout Europe and the Far East at the close of [[World War II]].<ref name="biog"/> She was married to Jack Temple, manager of the Westwood Girls, until he died in 1983.<ref name="biog"/> She arrived in [[Albert Square]] in 1998 when she moved into a flat with fellow senior-citizen [[Dot Cotton]] when both of their respective homes burnt down.

Lilly's fun-loving, cheeky personality was in stark contrast to Dot's and the two would often wind each other up with their obvious personality differences. She once even tried to persuade Dot that [[Jeff Healy (EastEnders)|Jeff Healy]] had amorous intentions towards her, which had Dot in a bit of a fluster.  She was also the first known person in the Square, before Jeff himself, to refer to her consistently as "Dorothy".

Lilly was never one to let her age spoil her fun and she could often be seen giving the youngsters of Walford a run for their money by clubbing in [[E20 (nightclub)|e20]], trouncing [[Huw Edwards (EastEnders)|Huw Edwards]] and [[Lenny Wallace]] at a game of [[poker]] and making an exhibition of herself in [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] classes. Her penchant for late-night clubbing even prompted owner [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] to bar her from his club, for fear that she would upstage his younger clientele. 

Lilly worked for [[Terry Raymond|Terry]] and [[Irene Raymond]] at the First Til' Last grocery store and when coming home from one of her late shifts she was mugged by an armed youth. After this ordeal, Lilly became a recluse, not wanting to go out for fear of being attacked again. Suddenly faced with her own fragility, Lilly was forced to deal with the realisation that she wasn't as strong or independent as she thought. It took many months for Lilly to face the outside world and her personality was changed forever as a result. 

Lilly and Dot's differences soon began to take their toll and in 1999 Lilly made the decision to leave Walford and move into sheltered accommodation when the insurance cheque for her flat came through, leaving Dot to move in with [[Pauline Fowler]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}</ref>

==Character creation and development==
The character Lilly Mattock, played by Barbara Keogh, was introduced in November 1998 by the executive producer of ''EastEnders'', [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]]. Lilly was one of several characters introduced in the latter part of 1998, readressing the cast balance following Robinson's decision to axe a large proportion of characters, earlier in the year.<ref name="ruthless">{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19991017/ai_n14499925|title=The EastEnders' boss is a secret poet..but does the world want to|publisher=''Sunday Mirror'' |accessdate=2007-10-21 | first=Fiona | last=Cummins | date=1999-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60611215.html|title=Nadia quits Square; She joins exodus from EastEnders|publisher=''The Mirror'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> 

Lilly was brought in as an elderly companion for the long-running character [[Dot Cotton]], played by [[June Brown]]; the characters moved in together following the destruction of their block of flats. Described as "the silver-haired gossip", Lilly was intended to be a "comedy double act" with Dot, taking over the place of Dot's former sparring partner, [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]).<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/4678803.stm Remembering EastEnders' Ethel]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-24.</ref> Storylines concentrated on the obvious personality differences between Dot and Lilly, and the problems this caused. The majority of Lilly's storylines were comic, for which she was praised by Merle Brown, critic for the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60428172.htmlhtml|title=Soap watch|publisher=''Daily Mirror'' |accessdate=2008-02-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> She was also used to highlight a more serious issue, when in 1999 she was mugged by a criminal called Gareth, and subsequently became [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]], refusing to go out. Though she eventually got over this with Dot's assistance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbcprograms.com/pbs/catalog/eastenders/eastde15.htm|title=EPISODE DESCRIPTIONS|publisher=''BBC'' |accessdate=2007-10-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071208065036/http://www.bbcprograms.com/pbs/catalog/eastenders/eastde15.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-08}}</ref> 

Lilly's backstory was revealed in her official biography on the BBC website, told from the character's perspective: 

{{cquote|Did I tell you that I used to be a dancer for the Westwood Girls? We used to tour Europe and the Far East performing for the troops. They were a great bunch of friends. We used to go to wild parties, drink champagne and be courted by handsome admirers. Of course, that was before I married my Jack. He was our manager and such a gentleman, he always treated me like a lady. We had 24 wonderful years together until he died of a heart attack. It's quite ironic really. We moved to Spain so that he could start to take things easy but he never could keep still. After all that I got a job performing on a cruise liner, which led to an opening in London booking other acts. I guess you could say I've spent most of my life in the entertainment business. Well, up until now - there's not much call for my kind of entertainment anymore.<ref name="biog2">{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000115214320/www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/wtour2/l_mattock.shtml|title=Lilly Mattock character profile|publisher=''BBC'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> }}

===Departure===
In September 1999, Lilly Mattock became the 26th character to be axed from ''EastEnders'' by Matthew Robinson, less than a year after her arrival.<ref name="lillyaxed">{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60161734.html |title= Busy Lilly's axed from the Square|publisher=''[[The People]]'' | date = 1999-09-26| accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> The character was never given an official exit, and was just quietly dropped from the serial, making her last appearance on 2 September 1999. In the storyline she had an argument with flatmate Dot Cotton after blurting out in [[The Queen Victoria]] public house that [[Mark Fowler]] was [[HIV positive]].<ref name="lillyaxed"/> A few weeks later, Dot was seen moving into the house of [[Pauline Fowler]], citing irreconcilable differences with Lilly. The decision to axe Lilly was reportedly prompted by actress June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton.<ref name="lillyaxed"/> Brown had allegedly complained that the comedy doubleact between Dot and Lilly was not right. A BBC insider told ''[[The People]]'' newspaper "[Dot and Lilly were] supposed to be two pensioners providing comedy scenes but June thought it was rubbish.  She even threatened to walk out but now she's staying on with the promise of better storylines". Actress Barbara Keogh was said to be "devastated" by the decision.<ref name="lillyaxed"/>
