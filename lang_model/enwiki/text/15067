The '''Yurok''', whose name means "downriver people" in the neighboring [[Karuk language]], are [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s who live in northwestern [[California]] near the [[Klamath River]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast.<ref name=sdsu/> Their autonym is '''Olekwo'l''' meaning "Persons." Today they live on the [[Yurok Indian Reservation]], on several [[rancheria]]s, or throughout [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]].<ref name=p159>Pritzker 159</ref>

==History==
Traditionally, Yurok people lived in permanent villages along the Klamath River. Some of the villages date back to the 14th century.<ref name=p159/> They fished for salmon along rivers, gathered ocean fish and shellfish, hunted game, and gathered plants.<ref name=sdsu/>

Their first contact with non-Natives was when Spanish explorers entered their territory in 1775. Fur traders and trappers from the [[Hudson Bay Company]] in 1827.<ref name=p159/> Following encounters with white settlers moving into their aboriginal lands during a [[gold rush]] in 1850, the Yurok were faced with disease and massacres that reduced their population by 75%. In 1855, most of those that remained were forcibly relocated to the [[Yurok Indian Reservation]] on the [[Klamath River]]. 

==Today==
On November 24, 1993, the Yurok Tribe adopted a constitution that details the jurisdiction and territory of their lands. Under the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-580, qualified applicants had the option of enrolling in the Yurok Tribe. Of the 3,685 qualified applicants for the Settlement Roll, 2,955 person chose Yurok membership.  227 of those members had a mailing address on the Yurok reservation but a majority lived within 50 miles of the reservation. The Yurok are currently the largest group of Native Americans in the state of California. The Yurok reservation of 63,035&nbsp;acres (255&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) has an 80% poverty rate and 70% of the inhabitants do not have telephone service or electricity, according to the tribe's webpage.

Fishing, hunting, and gathering remain important to tribal members. [[Basket weaving]] and woodcarver are important arts. A traditional hamlet of wooden plank buildings, called Sumeg, was built in 1990. The Jump Dance and Brush Dance are part of tribal ceremonies.<ref>Pritzker 161</ref>

==Language==
[[Image:Yurok basketweaver.jpg|right|thumb|Yurok basketweaver]]
[[Yurok language|Yurok]] is one of two [[Algonquian language]]s spoken in California; the other being [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]].<ref name=sdsu/> Between twenty and one hundred people speak the [[Yurok langauge]] today.<ref>Hinton 32</ref> The language is passed on through master-apprentice teams and through singing.<ref>Hinton 33</ref> Language classes have been offered through [[Humboldt State University]] and through a language immersion camp in 2010.<ref>[http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~yurok/web/links.php "Yurok Language Project."] ''University of California, Berkeley, Department of Linguistics.'' 2011 (retrieved 1 Feb 2011)</ref>

An usual feature of the language is that certain nouns change depending upon whether there is one, two, or three of the object. For instance, one human being would be ''ko:ra''' or ''ko'r'', two human beings would be ''ni'iyel'', and three human beings would be ''nahkseyt''.<ref>Hinton 120</ref>

==Population==
{{seealso|Population of Native California}}
Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially.  [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] put the 1770 population of the Yurok at 2500.<ref>Kroeber 1925:883</ref> [[Sherburne F. Cook]] initially agreed,<ref>Cook 1976:165</ref> but later raised this estimate to 3100.<ref>Cook 1956:84</ref>

By 1870, the Yurok population had declined to 1,350.<ref>Cook 1976:237</ref> By 1910 it was reported as 668 or 700.<ref>Cook 1976:237; Kroeber 1925:883</ref>

The US Census for the year 2000 indicates that there were 4413 Yurok living in California, combining those of one tribal descent and those with ancestors of several different tribes and groups.  There were 5793 Yurok living in all of the United States.
