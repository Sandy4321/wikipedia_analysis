The '''Hopkins School''' (or '''Hopkins Grammar School''') is a [[coeducation]]al [[private school|private]] [[day school]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. Founded in 1660, it is the fifth-oldest educational institution in the [[United States]] and the second-oldest [[high school|secondary school]] in continuous operation in [[North America]], younger only than the [[Roxbury Latin School]]. Hopkins was founded "for the breeding up of hopeful youths" with funds from [[Edward Hopkins]]' estate to fulfill [[John Davenport (clergyman)|John Davenport]]'s wishes to bring a [[grammar school]] to New Haven. After more than 250 years within the city, the school moved to its current [[campus]] on a hill overlooking New Haven in 1926.<ref name="peters">[http://www.hopkins.edu/who/history/ History] on Hopkins School's website by Thom Peters. Retrieved March 30, 2006.</ref> Hopkins has been coeducational since merging with Day Prospect Hill in 1972. The school's main rival in athletics is [[Hamden Hall Country Day School|Hamden Hall]] in [[Hamden, Connecticut]].

Hopkins is divided into three separate schools. The Junior school consists of the [[seventh grade|7th]] and [[eighth grade|8th]] grades, known as the Lower class. The high school is divided into the Middle ([[Ninth grade|9th]] and [[tenth grade|10th]] grade) and Upper ([[eleventh grade|11th]] and [[Twelfth grade|12th]] grade) classes. Most new students enter Hopkins in either the 7th or 9th grade. Despite a [[United States dollar|$]]40,000,000 [[Financial endowment|endowment]], Hopkins' [[tuition]] has increased substantially over recent years to fund new development.<ref>[http://buntingandlyon.com/detail.asp?id=155&search=&bhcp=1 Review of Hopkins] authored for the Directory of Private Schools at some point in 2005.

==History==
===Founding===
[[John Davenport (clergyman)|John Davenport]], a founder of the [[New Haven Colony]], was an early proponent of education in the colony.<ref name="hopchron">''Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School: 1660&ndash;1935''. Thomas B Davis. Quinnipiack Press, New Haven, CT. 1938</ref> [[Grammar school]]s of the time generally prepared young men for [[college]], but the [[Puritan]] colony was too far from [[England]] for its citizens to attend the existing English schools. <ref name="hopchron"/>  Parents of the time were generally more concerned with spending their money on essentials such as food and viewed formal education as an extravagance most could not afford.<ref name="hopchron"/> Davenport enlisted the help of a friend, [[Edward Hopkins]], [[List of Governors of Connecticut|governor]] of the [[Connecticut Colony]], to found a traditional grammar school that would teach [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] grammar.<ref name="hopchron"/>  

[[Image:Hopkins Crest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original Hopkins School [[coat of arms]] was designed by [[Edward Hopkins]] to be a personal symbol, though it was not an official piece of [[heraldry]].]]
Hopkins died in 1657 and bequeathed money to found a school dedicated to "the breeding up of hopeful youths for the public service of the country in future times." Colonial officials wanted Hopkins's bequest to remain in Connecticut and appointed three men, Davenport and two others, [[executor]]s of Hopkins's will. They created the "Hopkins Fund" from which Hopkins Grammar School was established in 1660. The school's first home was a small building on the [[New Haven Green]].

The exact date of Hopkins School's founding is a matter of definition. The historical record of the executors' report implies the trust was created on [[May 4]] [[1660]], but since the [[Julian calendar]] was in use then, the date corresponds to [[May 14]] on modern calendars. The papers which created the fund were presented and accepted on [[May 30]], and many use this date as the official date of the school's founding. Finally, on [[June 4]] ([[June 14]] on modern calendars) Davenport transferred control of the bequest to the Colony, on the condition that the colony accept responsibility for the support of the school.<ref name="hopchron"/>

===The Fallow Years===
"The Fallow Years" is a term coined by Thomas B. Davis in his history ''Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School'' to describe the period from 1696 to 1853.<ref name="hopchron"/> During this time the school had difficulty finding qualified [[schoolmaster]]s, and the Fund often fell short in paying them. This forced the school to take up collections to meet its payroll. Consequently, there was great turnover in Hopkins schoolmasters, some staying for no more than a year. Also contributing to the problem was the establishment of the Collegiate School in New Haven in 1701, which later became [[Yale University]]. The Collegiate School drew many local academics away from Hopkins.<ref name="hopchron"/>

Public opinion of Hopkins and [[academia]] in general weakened the school. During this time parents wanted children who could [[literacy|read and write]] [[English language|English]] and understand basic [[arithmetic]]s, but Hopkins continued to focus on subjects that parents deemed irrelevant, such as Latin. Parents were also displeased with schoolmasters who paid little attention to struggling students instead focusing only on the scholars. On [[January 12]] [[1713]], the committee which managed the Hopkins Fund began releasing [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]12&ndash;<U+00A3>15 annually to run [[Elementary school|elementary]] English schools in [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]] and [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]]. The town of New Haven stopped donating money to the Fund in 1719, which made hiring schoolmasters nearly impossible. Though the trustees of the Hopkins Fund constituted an independent body, the town was known to control them with financial pressures.<ref name="hopchron"/> Richard Mansfield served as schoolmaster from 1742 to 1747, and was the last headmaster until 1839 to serve for more than three years.<ref name="hopchron"/>

Although Hopkins was still somewhat unpopular with the locals, as New Haven grew so did Hopkins, and the school moved to a new larger brick building on the Green. Hopkins was somewhat rare among American schools in that it remained open during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Former schoolmaster John Hotchkiss was killed by the British in July 1779 during their invasion of New Haven, and former schoolmaster Noah Williston was captured. Although the school remained open, records seem to indicate it was frequently closed between September 1780&ndash;October 1781 "for vacation". Shortly after the Revolution, Hopkins hired Jared Mansfield for two terms (first from 1786 to 1790, then 1790 to 1795) to the unique position "Master of the Grammar School" to try and stabilize the school for the future. In between Mansfield's two terms, Abraham Bishop held a six-month term as headmaster during which he proposed radical reform, including making Hopkins coeducational, most of which never came to fruition. After the end of Mansfield's second term, the school returned to the pattern of short tenures for schoolmasters.<ref name="hopchron"/>

Hopkins moved buildings again in 1803 to an even larger facility on the Green that took up nearly an entire [[city block|block]]. Teachers were offered two-year contracts to teach at Hopkins, but rarely kept them. Hopkins boys grew "unruly and malicious", some roaming New Haven streets at night. <!-- REMOVING UNPUBLISHED MATERIALS UNTIL RESOLUTION IS REACHED ON ARCHIVE MATERIALS At the same time Hopkins' position as a center of preparation for [[higher education]] drew young teachers who were extremely zealous (either academically or religiously), but who quickly grew disappointed with teaching these boys. <ref name="manuscript">Unpublished Manscripts and archival materials by School Archivist Thom Peters, ca 2005. Retrieved March 19, 2006</ref> !--> In 1838 the school moved once again, as the trustees believed that moving the school away from the town center would allow its students to focus more on their studies. Throughout August and September that year, they rushed through the necessary transactions to buy the new plot of land. Following this move the trustees released an announcement to New Haven's three [[newspaper]]s summarizing their hope that this new location would provide sufficient space for the boys to learn and be separate enough that they could do so in peace.<ref name="hopchron"/>

[[Image:HGS General Plan 1922.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plan from 1922 for Hopkins atop the hill by 1895 graduate [[Henry Murphy]]. Baldwin ended up being built roughly between "The School" and "Masters House" on this plan.]]
Hawley Olmstead became headmaster in 1839 and ended the line of short-termed schoolmasters as he held the position for ten years. Although Olmstead thought much like Hopkins' early masters, namely that the school existed to prepare boys for college, he also modernized the curriculum in several ways. Most notably, English was finally added to the curriculum, and he began keeping accurate school rolls which solidified his final legacy, increasing the size of Hopkins student body. By the time Olmstead resigned due to poor health on July 28, 1849, school attendance had risen to 63 students. <ref name="hopchron"/>

As soon as Hawley Olmstead left, the school began to deteriorate once again, with attendance dropping to 45 students in 1850 and farther down to 20 by 1853. In addition, the recently founded [[Debate|debate society]] disbanded, with seven young members forming the [[secret society]] known as "The Club". Though this club grew no larger and tried to remain quiet, parents grew so annoyed with this supposedly "rough-housing" club that it was forced to disband in 1851. After the debate society and "The Club" were gone, many students sought out new ways to express their literary interests, including founding the [[school newspaper]] that survives to this day, ''The Razor''. Hawley's successor, Edward Olmstead, was seen by the trustees as a major failure and a cause of the school's rapid decline and was quickly replaced by James Whiton, who had just recently graduated from Yale. He further revised the curriculum by adding more English to it, and school attendance saw a rapid increase once again. Whiton taught for ten years and is regarded as the last of the "Fallow Years" headmasters.<ref name="hopchron"/>

===Modern day===
[[Headmaster]] George Lovell convinced the Board of Trustees to buy land north of New Haven for a new campus atop a hill in 1925.<ref name="rileyspeech">[http://www.hopkins.edu/news/news/detail.asp?from=archives&newsid=126602 Barbara Riley Presents the 2004 Hopkins Medal to John C.

Two local women's schools &mdash; the Day School (founded in 1907) and the Prospect Hill School (founded in 1930) &mdash; merged in 1960. The combined institution became the Day Prospect Hill School (DPH), a united women's education school, which in turn merged with Hopkins School in 1972.<ref name="peters" /> <!-- REMOVING UNPUBLISHED MATERIALS UNTIL RESOLUTION IS REACHED ON ARCHIVE MATERIALS Both schools had been considered [[sister school]]s to Hopkins and the merged DPH immediately had a close relationship with Hopkins. In 1969 both schools began considering a merger &mdash; DPH for expansion and Hopkins for diversification. Coordination between the two schools was considered but in August 1971 Hopkins announced it would become [[Coeducation|coeducational]] with or without DPH, and the merger was finalized in February 1972.

==Facilities==
[[Image:Hopkins campus map 01.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A map of the campus as of 2006, with Forest Road horizontally along the bottom of the map]] 
Baldwin Hall is the original building of the present campus. Baldwin has four floors including the [[basement]], with an underground passage to Hopkins House commonly called "the tunnel". Baldwin houses a computer lab, the language lab, the school store, and the Library. Baldwin was renovated in 2000 and had additional work done on the exterior in the summer of 2005. Hopkins House houses the administrative offices, teachers' offices, the teachers' lounge, and classrooms in the basement. This building was named for Edward Hopkins, one of the founders of Hopkins School. Day Prospect Hill (DPH) is the former home of the Day Prospect girls' school. Originally intended to be a temporary building, DPH houses a computer lab and classrooms mostly used by the Junior School. It is connected to the Arts Center, which houses Hopkins' art classrooms, and the "Old Gym".

Lovell Hall is a recently remodeled building behind Heath and between Baldwin and DPH. Lovell houses the main school auditorium, art and music classrooms, and teachers' offices. This building is named after longtime headmaster George Lovell, who led the school in the first half of the 20th century. Malone Science Center is at the center of the Hopkins' campus and houses the science classrooms and [[laboratory|labs]]. Donated by [[John C. Malone]], it is named for Malone's father. It was opened for students in 1999 and has three floors of classrooms.

Heath Commons is a two-story building that houses the school cafeteria and a student lounge. This building was also donated by John Malone and named for his favorite teacher while at Hopkins, John Heath.<ref>[https://www.hopkins.edu/login/login.asp?newsid=93385&usertype=1&mode=2 Barbara Riley's speech at Heath's Dedication] on the Hopkins School website from [[May 14]], [[2004]] by Barbara Riley.

Retrieved March 19, 2006.</ref> Heath houses the kitchens and dining hall, multipurpose rooms, and advisors' offices. 

The Walter Camp Athletic Center is named after alumnus [[Walter Camp]], Yale's football coach. The Athletic Center has two floors of gyms, a pool, a [[Athletic trainer|trainer]], and coaches office. The first floor is comprised largely of three standard-sized [[basketball court]]s. Dividers between these courts are removed and the united room is used for all-school assemblies. The second floor includes smaller weight rooms and training areas including the wrestling room. The Old Gym is a large one-room gym with a high roof. Before the Camp Athletic Center, this was the main athletic facility at Hopkins and is now used mostly for [[fencing]] team practices, an indoor [[ropes course]], and storage.

==Academics==
[[Image:HGS Student Body 1911 12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 1911 school body. Headmaster Charles H. Weller is first on the left in the third row and George Lovell is 7th from the left in the top row (he would go on to be headmaster from 1916&ndash;1953).]] 
Applicants to Hopkins undergo a series of standardized tests, and upon [[matriculation]], testing is done to place students at the appropriate level of instruction in [[mathematics]] and [[language]]s. Hopkins' academics are broken into [[Academic department|departments]] including [[English studies|English]], mathematics, [[science]], [[history]], [[arts]], language, and [[computer science]]. Each of the three class levels &mdash; Lower, Middle, and Upper &mdash; has a different level of choice in classes.<ref name="courseguide">''Hopkins Course Guide'', published annually by Hopkins School.</ref>

The Arts Department is made up of student organizations and academic classes in studio and performance art. A number of student groups feature performing arts; [[a cappella]] groups such as the Harmonaires, Triple Trio, and Spirens; theater groups such as the Hopkins Drama Association; and a variety of [[Choir|choral]] and instrumental performance groups. A gallery room in Baldwin holds shows of student and teacher art.

The English department is the only department in which Hopkins requires a student have at least one class in every semester. Upper-class students have two required semester classes: a college-prep writing course and a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]-centered course. The history department is divided between broad basic required courses called Atlantic Communities and elective courses that go into detail on subjects such as the [[American Civil War]]. The language department is divided into two subdepartments: the Classics, which teaches [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin; and Modern Languages, which teaches all other languages ([[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] are currently offered).<ref name="courseguide"/>

The mathematics department offers study from pre-algebra to advanced Calculus and [[Chaos Theory]]. The science department has three main tracks &mdash; Biology, Chemistry, and Physics &mdash; along which students can take entry-level courses and then more advanced [[Advanced Placement Program|AP]] and Honors courses. There are numerous one-off courses in subjects such as Introduction to Psychology or [[Environmental Studies]]. The computer science department offers basic computing courses in HTML and Java.<ref name="courseguide"/> 

Hopkins has various idiosyncrasies in its scheduling. The school declares [[snow day]]s for small amounts or simply the risk of snow. In addition, school ends every Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. as opposed to the usual 3:30 p.m. This extra time is generally used to schedule away sports meets, to allow for travel time. Hopkins adopted a modified [[block scheduling]] system in 2005, giving each class fifty-five minutes rather than forty minutes. Each student has two weekly class schedules, which alternate throughout the school year.

===Graduation requirements===
Hopkins' one-room Latin [[grammar school]] history is still reflected in graduation requirements. Every student is required to take an English course every semester, and Junior Schoolers are required to take Latin along with whichever other language they may take, if any. In addition to classical education, Hopkins requires three years of math courses and three years of a language (two years of Junior School level language counting as one full year for graduation requirements), two years of history and two years of science coursework. However, this only makes up a fraction of a student's total graduation credit requirement, while the rest is fulfilled by elective and advanced courses in any of the various departments.

==Student privileges==
Students have varying levels of power and responsibility at Hopkins, based upon what grade they are in and what leadership positions they hold. Lower classmen are 7th and 8th graders who study primarily in DPH, separated from the rest of the school. In addition, they have their own separate athletic teams and student organizations. Lower classmen have few privileges, though they can vote for certain Student Council posts and participate in the Junior School sports teams and student organizations of their choosing. 

Middle classmen are the two younger grades of standard [[Education in the United States|American]] high school, 9th and 10th grade. In addition to lower-class privileges, Middle classmen can begin designing their own schedules, choosing a few elective courses as opposed to the nearly completely pre-designed schedules of the Junior School. Middle classmen may also participate in general school teams and organizations.

Upperclassmen are the older two grades of American high school, 11th and 12th grade. Upperclassmen have nearly complete control over their own schedules as they begin to fulfill their graduation requirements in departments and move on to study topics of their own interest. Upperclassmen can also apply for a parking space and the ability to leave campus periodically. [[Eleventh grade|Juniors]] can run for Student Council president at the end of their Junior year; and [[Twelfth grade|Seniors]] can create a "Senior Project", a self-designed path of study replacing several courses he or she would otherwise be taking in the second semester.

<br clear="all">
[[Image:Hopkins stuco prez.jpg|thumb|left|2004-05 STUCO president ''(right)'' handing over his office to the 2005-06 president ''(left)'']]
===Student Council===
The Student Council (or STUCO) is the student government of Hopkins. Each middle and upper school class elects four representatives and a class president at the end of the previous year. Eighth-graders elect two of their 9th-grade representatives and their president at the end of 8th grade, then the final two representatives once the generally large group of students has joined Hopkins in the 9th grade. In the 2004&ndash;5 school year, the Junior school added their own section to the student council. Each class also elects representatives from individual advisor groups to deal with class activities and fundraisers.

The highest position in the Student Council is the Student Council President, a student elected at the end of their junior year to run the Council during their senior year. The president organizes school-wide fundraisers, delivers a speech at most assemblies, and holds some ceremonial [[graduation]] duties. The Student Council can be seen as an analogy to the American governmental system. Each class functions like a state with a [[legislature]] of advisor group representatives with the class president as a [[Governor#United States|Governor]]. Class representatives act as a [[United States Congress|Congress]] that deals with school-wide issues with the STUCO President fulfilling the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] role.
<br clear="all">

==Extracurricular activities==
[[Image:Hopkins Old Dining Hall.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hopkins Dining Hall, 1928]]
Junior school students select from their own separate lists of activities during advisor meetings, and their activities sessions are separate from the general school. The main school activities program begins with the Activities Fair, usually held in early September, where every activity puts on a display and signs up members for that school year. These various clubs and organizations then meet each Wednesday during the last period of the day, which is set aside as an activities period as opposed to an academic one.

In addition to traditional school organizations such as the student newspaper and [[yearbook]], Hopkins focuses strongly on community service especially within the New Haven community itself. The Student government runs school-wide events such as a fundraiser for the [[Connecticut Food Bank]], but the bulk of Hopkins community service happens through clubs. Both the diversity clubs such as a [[racial equality]] club or a [[Gay-Straight Alliance]] and specific service clubs such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] organize a variety of fundraisers and events throughout the year. While not a graduation requirement, community service is an essential aspect of Hopkins life.

Hopkins hosts a [[Summerbridge]] program during the summer, opening all of the campus not being used by regular [[summer school]] programs to Summerbridge.<ref>[http://www.hopkins.edu/community/summerbridge/ Hopkins Summerbridge information] on the Hopkins homepage, large portion written by Kate Goldenheim in September 2005. Retrieved March 19, 2006.</ref> Summerbridge is a community service program meant to further the education of children from poor families.<ref>[http://summerbridge.org/index.html Summerbridge Homepage] from the Breakthrough Collaborative at some point in 2005. Retrieved March 19, 2006.</ref> Over 20% of families in New Haven are below the poverty line.

===Athletics===
[[Image:HGS football 1891.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The 1891 [[American football|football]] team]]
Hopkins' athletics function under a trimester system, with students taking an athletic for each of the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Students may choose to participate in a [[team sport]] if they make the team, an intramural sport, or an independent sport where the student participates in a school-approved athletic activity such as [[martial arts]] lessons. Seniors may also take one season off and not take any athletic for that season. Sports offered at Hopkins vary depending on the season and include [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[water polo]], [[American football|football]], [[field hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[fencing]], [[Athletics (track and field)|track]] (both outdoor and indoor), [[swimming]]/[[diving]], [[wrestling]], [[golf]], [[lacrosse]], [[tennis]], [[baseball]], and [[softball]]. Hopkins is a member of the [[New England Preparatory School Athletic Council]].<ref>[http://www.nepsac.org/ Homepage] of NEPSAC. Retrieved March 19, 2006.</ref> Although Hopkins competes with many schools in sporting events, a [[rival]]ry has developed with nearby [[Hamden Hall]].

===The Hilltoppers===
The Hopkins school [[mascot]] was originally the [[deer|stag]], first appearing on Edward Hopkins' self-designed [[Seal (device)|seal]] in 1660. The stag did not make live appearances as the mascot, but was the animal generally associated with the school. Hopkins' sports teams were first referred to as "Hilltoppers" in the 1980s. [[Archivist|School archivist]] Thom Peters is responsible for the adoption of the goat as a school mascot. He had been organizing a fundraiser in the 1990s and was planning on selling photographs with the school mascot. No stag was available, but a school family was willing to lend a goat to Peters. In addition, the school was able to find a goat costume but not a stag costume, so the goat was an easier mascot for large sporting events.<ref name="manuscript"/> The goat has gone on to become Hopkins' predominant mascot, the stag now only appearing on the seal. !-->
