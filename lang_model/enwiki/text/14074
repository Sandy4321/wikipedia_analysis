'''Buzzcocks''' are an English punk band formed in [[Bolton]] in 1976, led by singer<U+2013>songwriter<U+2013>guitarist [[Pete Shelley]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:rxkqikx6bb39~T1 Erlewine, Stephen Thomas; Allmusic.com profile of Buzzcocks; URl accessed 6 Jan 2007]</ref>

They are regarded as an important influence{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} on the [[Music of Manchester|Manchester music scene]], the [[independent record label]] movement, [[punk rock]], [[power pop]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie rock]].<ref name="The Buzzcocks, Pop Punk Pioneers"/> They achieved commercial success with singles that fused pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on ''[[Singles Going Steady]]'', described by critic [[Ned Raggett]] as a "punk masterpiece".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:diftxqw5ld6e | publisher=Allmusic | first=Ned | last=Raggett | title=Singles Going Steady (review) | accessdate=19 October 2009 }}</ref> The widely covered "[[Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)]]" remains one of their best-known songs.

The name "Buzzcocks" was chosen by Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley after reading the headline "it's the buzz, cocks!" in a review of the TV series ''[[Rock Follies]]'' in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine. The "buzz" is the excitement of playing on stage; "cock" is Manchester slang meaning "mate" (as in friend / buddy). They thought it captured the excitement of the [[Sex Pistols]] and nascent punk scene.<ref name="Gimarc">Gimarc, George (2005) ''Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock 1970-1982'', Backbeat Books, ISBN 0-87930-848-6, p. 27</ref>

==Career==
===Early years===
[[Howard Trafford]], a student at Bolton Institute of Technology (now the University of Bolton), placed a notice in the college looking for musicians sharing a liking for [[The Velvet Underground]]'s song "[[Sister Ray]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7583-buzzcocks/ |title=Pitchfork: Buzzcocks interview |date=29 January 2009 |publisher=Pitchfork Media |accessdate=15 April 2009}}</ref> [[Peter McNeish]],<ref name="urbis">{{cite web |author=Aidan O'Rourke |url=http://www.aidan.co.uk/article_urbis_buzzcocks.htm |title=Event Review: An Evening with Buzzcocks |date=12 August|publisher=Urbis Manchester |accessdate=22 August 2009}}</ref> a fellow student at the Institute, responded to the notice. Trafford played electronic music<ref name="urbis" /> and McNeish had played rock.

McNeish assumed the stage name Pete Shelley, and Trafford named himself Howard Devoto, after a bus driver in Cambridge. In late 1975, Shelley and Devoto recruited a drummer and formed an embryonic version of Buzzcocks that did not perform in front of an audience and which dissolved after a number of rehearsals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The band formed as the Buzzcocks in February 1976 and performed live for the first time on 1 April 1976 at their college. [[Garth Davies]] played bass guitar and Mick Singleton played drums. Singleton also played in local band Black Cat Bone.<ref name="buzzcocksdiscography">{{cite web |title=Discography  |url=http://www.buzzcocks.com/buzzcocksdiscography.txt |publisher=buzzcocks.com |format=TXT |date=24 February 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

After reading an ''[[NME]]'' review of the Sex Pistols' first performance, Shelley and Devoto travelled to London together to see the Sex Pistols in February 1976. Shelley and Devoto were impressed by what they saw and arranged for the Sex Pistols to come and perform at the [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester, in June 1976. Buzzcocks intended to play at this concert, but the other musicians dropped out, and Shelley and Devoto were unable to recruit other musicians in time for the gig. Once they had recruited bass guitarist [[Steve Diggle]] and drummer [[John Maher (Buzzcocks drummer)|John Maher]], they made their debut opening for the Sex Pistols' second Manchester concert in July 1976. A brief clip of Devoto-era Buzzcocks performing [[The Troggs]] "I Can't Control Myself" appears in the ''Punk: Attitude'' documentary directed by [[Don Letts]]. In September 1976 the band travelled to London to perform at the two-day [[100 Club Punk Festival]], organised by [[Malcolm McLaren]]. Other performers included: the Sex Pistols, [[Subway Sect]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[The Clash]], [[The Vibrators]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and the French band [[Stinky Toys]].

By the end of the year, Buzzcocks had recorded and released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Spiral Scratch (EP)|Spiral Scratch]]'' on their own ''New Hormones'' label, making them one of the first punk groups to establish an [[independent record label]] trailing only [[The Saints (band)|The Saints]]' "[[(I'm) Stranded]]". Produced by [[Martin Hannett]], the music was roughly recorded, insistently repetitive, and energetic. "Boredom" announced punk's rebellion against the status quo while templating a strident musical minimalism (the guitar solo consisting of two repeated notes). The demos recorded while Devoto was in the band were later issued officially as [[Time's Up (Buzzcocks album)|Time's Up]]. Long available as a bootleg, this album includes the alternative takes of all the tracks from the ''Spiral Scratch'' EP as well as early version of tracks that later appeared on the official debut ''Another Music in a Different Kitchen''.

After a few months, Devoto left the group; he returned to college for a year, then formed [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]. Pete Shelley continued as vocalist; his high-pitched, melodic singing stood in stark contrast to the gruff [[Pub rock (UK)|pub rock]] vocal stylings of many punk contemporaries. Diggle switched from bass to guitar, and Garth Davies rejoined on bass as Garth Smith or Garth. Garth appeared on the band<U+2019>s first Radio 1 Peel Session, in September 1977, but due to his alcoholism he was quickly replaced with [[Steve Garvey (musician)|Steve Garvey]], joining Dirty Looks in New York. This new line-up signed with [[United Artists Records]].

===Signing to UAI===
Their first UAI Buzzcocks single, "Orgasm Addict", was a playful examination of compulsive sexuality that was (and remains) uncommonly bold. The BBC refused to play the song, but the single sold well. Later, more ambiguous songs staked out a territory defined by Shelley's bisexuality and punk's aversion to serious examination of [[human sexuality]]. The next single, "What Do I Get?" reached the UK top 40 charts.<ref name="chartstats">{{cite web

}}</ref> "Lipstick", the B-side to "Promises," shared the same ascending progression of notes in its chorus as [[Magazine (band)|Magazine's]] first single, "Shot By Both Sides," also released in 1978.

Their original career consisted of three LPs: ''[[Another Music in a Different Kitchen]]'', ''[[Love Bites (Buzzcocks album)|Love Bites]]'', and ''[[A Different Kind of Tension]]'', each supported by extensive touring in Europe and the U.S. Their trademark sound was a marriage of catchy pop melodies with punk guitar energy, backed by an unusually tight and skilled [[rhythm section]]. They advanced drastically in musical and lyrical sophistication: by the end they were quoting American writer [[William S. Burroughs]] ("A Different Kind of Tension"), declaiming their catechism in the anthem "I Believe", and tuning in to a fantasy radio station on which their songs could be heard ("Radio Nine"). In 1980, Liberty Records signed the band, and three singles were released. However, only one of these, the double 'A' side "Why She's A Girl From The Chainstore/Are Everything" made the Top 75.

In parallel with Buzzcocks, Pete Shelley, formed a more experimental and [[post-punk]] band, The Tiller Boys, along with Eric Random and Francis Cookson, while Steve Garvey joined [[The Teardrops (band)|The Teardrops]] in 1978, along with [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]'s Tony Friel and [[Karl Burns]]; both bands were releasing material in late 1970s and broke up at the same time Buzzcocks split up.

===Breakup and reunions===
After recording demos for a fourth album the group disbanded in 1981, when Shelley took up a solo career. Diggle and Maher formed [[Flag of Convenience (band)|Flag of Convenience]], who released several singles between 1982 and 1989. Garvey formed [[Motivation (band)|Motivation]] and joined [[Blue Orchids]], moving to New York, shortly afterwards, to continue with the first band. Maher joined [[Wah!]] by the time Buzzcocks broke up. Shelley and Devoto teamed up in 2002 for the first time since 1976, producing the album [[Buzzkunst]], a play on the German word for 'Art'. The album was a mix of electronic music and punk.

John Maher now owns and runs John Maher Racing, a vintage Volkswagen performance tuning workshop located on the [[Isle of Harris]], Scotland.<ref>[http://www.johnmaherracing.co.uk/ John Maher Racing: VW Performance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He has built and raced several [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s. In 2005, Shelley re-recorded "Ever Fallen In Love" with an all-star group, including [[Roger Daltrey]], [[David Gilmour]], [[Peter Hook]], [[Elton John]], [[Robert Plant]] and several contemporary bands, as a tribute to [[John Peel]]. Proceeds went to [[Amnesty International]]. Shelley also performed the song live, with Plant, Daltrey, Gilmour, Hook and [[Jeff Beck]] at the 2005 [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/news/story/0,11711,1577076,00.html "Music legends unite for Peel tribute single"] (The Guardian, 23 September 2005)</ref>

Buzzcocks have reformed several times since 1989, featuring Shelley and Diggle with other musicians; initially with Maher and Garvey for a world tour, then briefly replacing Maher with [[The Smiths|Smiths]] drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. In 1992, [[Tony Barber (bassist)|Tony Barber]] joined on bass and Phil Barker on drums. This line-up toured on one of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana's]] last-ever tours in 1994. In April 2006, Barker left and was replaced by [[Danny Farrant]]. In March 2006, the band released their eighth studio album, ''[[Flat-Pack Philosophy]]'', on [[Cooking Vinyl Records]], the supporting tour found them playing on a leg of the mid-2006 [[Vans Warped Tour]].

They made an appearance for [[Max<U+00EF>mo Park]]'s homecoming gig in Newcastle upon Tyne on 15 December 2007.

In April 2008, Barber left and was replaced by Chris Remmington.

In January 2009 the band embarked on a UK and European tour, the "Another Bites Tour", in which they played their first two albums in full, as well as an encore of their other hits.<ref>http://www.buzzcocks.com/site/livedates.html</ref>

In July 2009, the Buzzcocks played in [[Serbia]] for the first time, at the EXIT festival in [[Novi Sad]]. Their song, "Why Can't I Touch It" was played in the second episode of the sixth season of TV series ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]''.

On 9 November 2009, Buzzcocks played a very rare performance on a small Balcony overlooking Dame Street in Dublin, for the music viral show [[BalconyTV]].<ref>http://www.balconytv.com/v/buzzcocks--2</ref>

In December 2009 they will play as the main support act for [[The Courteeners]].<ref>http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=8520432&id=30118565360</ref>

===TV show title===
Buzzcocks' name was combined with the title of the Sex Pistols' album ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols|Never Mind the Bollocks]]'' to create the title of the long-running UK comedy panel game show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. Diggle claimed in his autobiography that he and Shelley had only granted the BBC use of their name under the impression that it would be a one-off, probably unsuccessful pilot, and that they are now mildly disgruntled that the name is more readily associated in Britain with the TV series than with their band.<ref>Diggle, S and Rawlings, T, ''Harmony In My Head'' (Helter Skelter, 2003, ISBN 1-900924-37-4 )</ref> Shelley himself appeared on the programme in 2000, where host Mark Lamarr introduced Shelley by saying without the Buzzcocks "there'd be no [[The Smiths|Smiths]] or [[Radiohead (band)|Radiohead]], and this show would be called Never Mind [[Joan Armatrading]]!"
