'''''Rocky''''' (1976) is a [[motion picture]] written by and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]] as an [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] [[boxing|boxer]]. It tells the rags-to-riches [[American Dream]] story of [[Italian-American]] "[[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]]", a slightly dim-witted but good-hearted "collection agent" for a [[loan shark]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] with a penchant for [[boxing]], who gets a shot at the world heavyweight title. It was directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] who won an Oscar for his direction. The final fight scene in the movie was inspired by a real-life fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]].<ref name = "Ali"/> The film was an unexpected [[sleeper hit]]<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml|title = Inside the Actors Studio with Sylvester Stallone|accessdate = 28 September|accessyear = 2006}}</ref> garnering rave reviews, which helped to launch Stallone's career.

Production of a sixth installment in the series, to be titled ''[[Rocky Balboa]]'', and again starring and directed by Stallone, was announced by MGM/Sony in [[October]] [[2005]] and is expected to be released on [[December 22]], [[2006]].<ref name = "Balboa">{{cite web|title = Rocky Balboa Release Date |url = http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/ap/20051018/112964406000.html|accessdate = 24 August| accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  

== Production ==

The original concept for ''Rocky'' was envisioned by Sylvester Stallone after he witnessed a fight between [[Muhammed Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]]; the idea of one man going the distance and putting up a fierce fight against all odds appealed to Stallone and he began writing the script for ''Rocky''. One day while at a [[Casting (performing arts)|casting call]] for [[Irwin Winkler]] and [[Robert Chartoff]], Stallone brought up his idea for Rocky; Winkler was impressed with this concept and asked Stallone to come back with the script. Although Winkler and Chartoff liked the script, they were initially reluctant to allow Stallone to play the part of "Rocky Balboa", considering instead other big name actors such as [[James Caan]], [[Robert Redford]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stallone accepted this fact at first, but once the payment for the part exeeded US$350,000, Stallone decided that he would audition.<ref name = "Ali"/> 

However, the producers had trouble casting other key characters in the story. Both Talia Shire and Carl Weathers were cast very late by production standards, although they both were cast on the same day. Shire's audition impressed both the producers and Stallone; her appearance, acting and even voice were seen to fit the part of "Adrian" perfectly. The character of "Apollo Creed" was initially going to be played by [[Ken Norton]], but when he pulled out, Carl Weathers auditioned. Impressed with Weathers's attitude, body, and voice, Stallone insisted that he play the part.<ref name = "Ali"/> 

Certain elements of ''Rocky'''s original script were changed prior to its release. The film was originally meant to have a much darker tone. Mickey, for examples, was originally portrayed as a very racist man, and the ending of ''Rocky'', as originally written, had Rocky throw the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the [[professional boxing]] world.<ref name = "Ali" />

[[Garrett Brown]]'s [[Steadicam]], a camera attached to a weighted system of pulleys so that it would not shake while its operator ran, was used for the first time in this movie, during Rocky's training run up the flights of stairs.<ref name = "Stedicam">{{cite web| title = "Stedicam" | url = http://www.garrettbrown.com/| accessdate = 24 August| accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The final fight scene was fought in reverse order, with the actors starting out in heavy [[make-up]], which eventually wore off as the scenes were shot.<ref name = "Trivia">{{cite web| title = "Rocky Trivia" | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/trivia | accessdate = 24 August| accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

== Plot ==
{{Spoiler}}
[[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]] is a dead-end, "bottom of the barrel" Italian-American from [[South Philadelphia]], who is going nowhere in life. He works days as an enforcer for a loan shark and as a [[Professional Boxing|boxer]] at night. With the nation's [[American Revolution|bicentennial]] approaching, and scheduled opponent injured, the undefeated [[heavyweight champion]] [[Apollo Creed]] ([[Carl Weathers]]) searches for a new opponent for the [[Boxing|bout]] on the nation's birthday. With all the deserving competitors unavailable for one reason or another, Creed comes up with the idea that he will fight a local [[Philadelphia]] underdog and selects Rocky, and by doing so give him a chance at the title. 

Creed sees the whole thing as a joke and a spectacle rather than a fight. At first, his attitude seems justified. In the time leading up to the fight, Rocky trains with  [[1920s]]-era [[bantamweight]] fighter Mickey Goldmill, played by [[Burgess Meredith]], but Rocky initially shows little in the way of either ability or true desire. However, Rocky soon falls in love with his best friend Paulie's sister, Adrian ([[Talia Shire]]), and a new-found focus and determination is sparked within him.  After rededicating himself to intense training, Rocky is ready to take his million-to-one shot at the title. Nonetheless, the night before the match, Rocky admits to Adrian that he belives he cannot actually win.    

[[image:Rocky_screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Rocky fighting Apollo Creed]]
Creed arrives at the stadium, dressed as [[George Washington]]. He then removes this outfit to reveal an [[Uncle Sam]] costume, to which the crowd and commentators react with surprise. In the first round, Creed treats the match as a joke until Rocky catches him with a left hook that throws Creed on his back and knocks him down. A great achievement as no-one had ever even knocked Creed over, let alone in the first minutes.  From that point on, Creed takes the match seriously as does Rocky even more so. The fight continues for all fifteen rounds, Rocky and Creed suffering severe [[injuries]]. As the fight ends, Creed, disbelieving but respectful of what Rocky has done, embraces Rocky and says to him in exhaustion, "Ain't gonna be no rematch."  Rocky, answers back, "Don't want one." The film concludes with Rocky calling out to Adrian and eventually, as she makes her way to the ring, telling her that he loves her; as in the background Apollo Creed is annoumced the winner by split [[split decision]].

== Cast ==
=== Main Cast ===
*'''Jamie Hampton''' as '''[[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]]''': Rocky is a failed boxer turned debt collector, who is given a second chance when Apollo Creed gives him an opportunity to fight for the heavyweight title. While training for the bout, he falls in love with Adrian.
*'''Pamela Anderson''' as '''Adrian''': Adrian is a quiet pet store attendant whom Rocky falls for. Initially she doesn't reciprocate Rocky's feelings, but eventually she too falls in love.
*'''Aaron Darling'''Paulie''': Paulie is Adrian's loud and boorish brother, who works as a freezing worker. He assists Rocky by letting him practice his punches by pounding carcasses in the storehouse.
*Joshua Jackson as '''[[Apollo Creed]]''': Rocky's opponent. Once his original opponent for the heavyweight fight pulls out, Apollo comes up with the idea of giving a nobody a chance at the title. His larger-than-life character was heavily influenced by [[Muhammed Ali]].<ref name = "Ali" />
*'''Daniel Green''' as ''' Mickey ''': Owner of a local boxing gym, he insists on assisting Rocky to win the title, even though he gave up on Rocky earlier.

=== Cameo appearances ===
Given the inevitable comparison between the outspoken Apollo Creed and the real-life outspoken [[Muhammad Ali]], one interesting detail is the cameo appearance of [[Joe Frazier]], a former world [[heavyweight]] champion who fought Ali three times, as himself. Frazier accuses Creed of "dodging him" prior to the start of the match with Rocky. Stallone invited all boxing heavyweight champions to participate in the cameo, with Joe Frazier being the only one who accepted the invitation.  In that year's [[Academy Awards]], Ali had a small comic scene of confronting Stallone onstage which ended amiably to make it clear that he was not offended by the film. 

Due to the film's low budget, members of Sylvester Stallone's family were used to play certain minor parts; his father appears as a bell ringer (a person who signals  when a round begins and ends), his brother was used as a street corner singer and Stallone's first wife was the set [[photographer]].<ref name = "Ali"/> Other cameos included Los Angeles television [[sportscaster]] [[Stu Nahan]] playing himself and [[Lloyd Kaufman]], founder of the longest running independent film company [[Troma]], makes an appearance as a drunk.

=== Reviews ===

After its release in 1976, ''Rocky'' received mostly positive reviews, with it being very well received by the Directors Guild of America<ref name = "Ali"/> and regular reviewers.

The film is also on the [[American Film Institute]]'s 100 best films of all top (at #78). However, Vincent Canby of the [[New York Times]] called it "Pure '30's make believe" and slammed both Stallone's acting preformance and called Alvidson's direction "...none too decisive..."<ref>{{cite web|date = November 22, 1976|accessdate = 23 September|accessyear = 2006|url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&title1=Rocky%20(Movie)&title2=&reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&pdate=19761122&v_id=|title = Vincent Cabny Rock Review for New York Times}}</ref> Today, the film enjoys a positive reputation as a classic and still receives generally positive reviews.

== Influence ==

In 1982 a statue, commisioned by Stallone for ''[[Rocky III]]'' of Rocky was placed at the top of [[Rocky Steps|Philadelphia Museum of Art steps]] (The steps Stallone ran up in the movie). Following it's placement atop the steps City Commerce Director Dick Doran claimed that Stallone and [[Rocky Balboa (Character)|Rocky]] had done more for the city's image than "anyone since Ben Franklin". However differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to it being moved to the sidewalk outside the Philidelphia Spectrum Arena. The statue was moved back to the top of the steps for ''[[Rocky V]]'' before being moved back to the Spectrum after it closed. In 2006 the statue was moved back to the Art Museum to commerate the 30th Anniversary of the original ''Rocky'' movie, but this time the statue was placed at the bottom of the steps<ref name = "Rocky Statue">{{cite web|accessdate = 23 September|accessyear = 2006|url = http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm|title = Rocky Statue}}</ref>.

The famous scene of Rocky running up the steps to the museum has became a cultural icon. During [[E!|E! Channel's]] ''101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment'' the scene was placed at number 13 on the list<ref>{{cite web|accessdate = 23 September|accessyear = 2006|url = http://www.eonline.com/On/101/MostAwesome/List/index5.html|title = E! Channel's 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment}}</ref>. During the 1996 Olympic Torch Relay, Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps. The scene is also frequently parodied amongst the media. In the [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] episode "[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]", Lisa Simpson runs a up a flight of stairs, just as Stallone did in ''Rocky'', during her training run, while wearing a similar tracksuit to the one worn by Rocky<ref>{{cite web|accessdate = 25 September|accessyear 2006|url = http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/im-spelling-as-fast-as-i-can/episode/181997/trivia.html|title = I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can @ TV.com}}</ref>.

== Video Games ==

The film has also been made into multiple video games; the first ''Rocky'' video game was released by [[Coleco]] for [[Colecovision]] in [[1983]]. <ref>{{cite web| title = Game Companies : Coleco | url =http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/company/73872.html| accessdate = 24 August| accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Another was released in [[1987]] for the [[Sega Master System]]. More recently, a ''Rocky'' video game was released in 2002 for the [[Nintendo Gamecube]], [[Sony Playstation 2]], and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]], and a sequel released in 2004 for the [[Sony Playstation 2]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]].
