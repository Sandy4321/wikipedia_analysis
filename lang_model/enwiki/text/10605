==History==
===Early years & Debut Album (1999<U+2013>2001)===
Killswitch Engage formed from the two metalcore bands, [[Overcast (band)|Overcast]] and [[Aftershock (band)|Aftershock]]  during the late 1990s.<ref name="archivekse"/>  After the dissolving of Overcast in 1998, bassist [[Mike D'Antonio]] [[jam (music)|jammed]] with Aftershock guitarist [[Adam Dutkiewicz]]. Dutkiewicz recruited guitarist [[Joel Stroetzel]] from Aftershock, and vocalist [[Jesse Leach]] of the band Nothing Stays Gold (who were signed to a record label owned by Dutkiewicz's brother Tobias Dutkiewicz, who was also the vocalist in Aftershock), to form a new band, Killswitch Engage.<ref name="archivekse">{{cite web |url=http://www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/band.f/band.html |title=KILLSWITCH ENGAGE |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010210205445/www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/band.f/band.html |archivedate=2000-10-21 |publisher=KillswitchEngage.com |last=Walker |first=Morgan |date=May 2000 |accessdate=2010-02-11}}</ref> The band's name is derived from an episode of the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' entitled "[[Kill Switch (The X-Files)|Kill Switch]]", written by [[William Gibson]], who gave the episode this title after meeting the industrial band [[Kill Switch...Klick]].

In 1999, Killswitch Engage recorded a [[demo album|demo tape]] containing four tracks, including "Soilborn", Killswitch Engage's first song.<ref name="releases">{{cite web |url=http://www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/release/release.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010808110151/www.killswitchengage.com/killswitchengage/release/release.html |title=KILLSWITCH ENGAGE |archivedate=2001-08-08 |publisher=KillswitchEngage.com |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>  The demo tape was first released at the band's first show, opening for melodic death metal act [[In Flames]], in November 1999.<ref name="archivekse"/><ref name="releases"/> They released their [[Killswitch Engage (2000 album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year. Although initially the album was not a financial success and did not land on any charts, it attracted the interest of Carl Severson, who worked at [[Roadrunner Records]] at the time. Severson handed ''Killswitch Engage'' to several Roadrunner representatives. Mike Gitter, a [[talent agent]] of the company, contacted D'Antonio, attended several of the band's shows, and offered the band a recording contract with Roadrunner. Realizing Roadrunner had the resources to promote and distribute Killswitch Engage releases, the band accepted his offer, declining several offers from smaller labels.<ref name="Worldablaze">{{cite video

Following ''Alive or Just Breathing''{{'}}s release, which was written and recorded for two guitarists, the band decided to expand and become a fivesome; Dutkiewicz moved to guitar and former Aftershock drummer [[Tom Gomes]] filled in the vacant drummer position.  After Leach was married on April 20, 2002 and began touring again he fell into a depression. Leach left the band a few days before the band was meant to play a show and sent the band members an e-mail telling them he had quit. D'Antonio said in an interview that "after three years of hanging out with the dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email was a little bit harsh."<ref name="Killswitch Engage Land New Frontman">{{cite web

The band immediately started to search for a replacement vocalist and found [[Howard Jones (American musician)|Howard Jones]] of [[Blood Has Been Shed]]. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more I listened to it, I realized there's some really good songs here".<ref name="Killswitch Engage - Decibel Magazine"/> After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. [[Philip Labonte]] of [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]] tried out for lead vocals but lost to former vocalist Howard Jones. Without listening to the entire self-titled album or ''Alive or Just Breathing'', Jones had to memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.<ref name="Killswitch Engage - Decibel Magazine">{{cite web

On January 4, 2012, the band announced via the band's official website, along with their other official sources, that Howard Jones had left the band after his nine-year membership with them.<ref name="jonesleaves"/> In the statement, the band did not disclose the reason for this decision out of respect for Jones, but simply thanked him for his nine years with the band and wished him well, as well as thanking the fans for their support as they began the search for a new lead singer.<ref name=jonesleaves>{{cite web|title=Howard Jones Leaves Killswitch Engage|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/top-posts/howard-jones-leaves-killswitch-engage/|publisher=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.killswitchengage.com/index.php/kse/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>  On January 6, 2012, Howard posted a statement of his own on his Facebook page and the band's official website to explain his reasons for leaving, which included medical issues as well as a loss of enthusiasm for writing and touring.  He likewise thanked the other members of Killswitch Engage and the fans for standing by him and for the many experiences they shared, and also left the door open for further musical endeavors in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/howard-jones-explains-exit-from-killswitch-engage/ |title=Singer Howard Jones Explains His Exit From Killswitch Engage |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=2012-01-06 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>  Soon after the announcement of Jones's departure, rumors began that Labonte would officially take over lead vocals due to his previous history with the band, although Labonte quickly disregarded the rumor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=167917 |title=Blabbermouth.Net - All That Remains Singer Will Not Be Joining Killswitch Engage |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>

The band's search for a new singer concluded in February with the announcement that original lead vocalist Jesse Leach would return to the band, as the band felt that Leach's energy, as well as his overall comfort and command of both the old and new material, made him the clear choice during auditions.<ref name=facebook>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/killswitchengage/posts/10150528798241581|publisher=facebook.com |last = Killswitch Engage|accessdate=08 Feb 2012 |date=08 Feb 2012 |title= Killswitch Engage Announce New Singer: Jesse Leach}}</ref>
Since Leach's return, Killswitch Engage has begun the process of recording their latest album, expected to be released in late 2012.  They also continued to tour, performing Leach's first show since 2002 at the New England Metal and Hardcore Fest on April 22, 2012. 

On June 20, a new single titled "No End in Sight" was leaked on [[Youtube]]. Not long after the song was leaked, the users faced copyright strikes and the videos were soon deleted. Later, the band performed this song live on the [[Metal Hammer]] [[Trespass America]] Tour, confirming the song's title.

From July 13 <U+2013> August 28, 2012, Killswitch Engage will take part in [[Metal Hammer]]'s  "[[Trespass America Festival]]" headlined by [[Five Finger Death Punch]] with additional support from [[God Forbid]], [[Emmure]], [[Pop Evil]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] and [[Battlecross]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Long|last=Paul|date=April 24, 2012|url=http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=8692|title=Tresspass America Touring Fest Breaks Out: FFDP, Killswitch, Trivium, God Forbid, Hit the Road|work=KNAC|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>

Taylor of Allmusic said ''Alive or Just Breathing'' is "a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of the meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]]."<ref name=" Alive or Just Breathing - Killswitch Engage">{{cite web

Both former vocalists Jesse Leach and Howard Jones write lyrics that are considered to be positive.<ref name="Worldablaze" />  Leach stated on ''[[(Set This) World Ablaze]]'', that the lyrics contain "unity, positivity, [and] love."<ref name="Worldablaze"/>  On the lyrical themes of ''[[Killswitch Engage (2009 album)|Killswitch Engage]]'', [[Ultimate Guitar]] reviewer Amy Sciarretto notes:

On Killswitch Engage's 2009 release, Howard Jones states the change in lyrical themes:
