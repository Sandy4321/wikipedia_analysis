The '''Psylli''' were an ancient [[North Africa]]n tribe or ethnic group.<ref name="1911enc">{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Serpent-worship|title=1911 Encyclopaedia Brittanica - Serpent worship|date=1911}}</ref>

Of the Psylli [[Herodotus]] described <U+201C>a tribe that met with extinction<U+201D> after the desert wind dried up their water holes.(IV.173)<!-- they marched out to do battle with it and were buried alive-->{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[Pliny the Elder]] said that they were <U+201C>almost exterminated<U+201D> in a war with their neighbours, the [[Nasamones]], but the descendants of those who escaped <U+201C>survive today in a few places<U+201D> (VII.2.14).{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[Strabo]] does not mention an unsuccessful war against either the desert wind or the [[Nasamones]] but only that the Psylli were still in existence, occupying <U+201C>a barren and arid region<U+201D> (XVII.3.23){{citation needed|date=February 2010}} below the Nasamones. Later writers, especially poets, bestowed on the Psylli a reputation as great [[snake charmers]].{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In his ''Roman History'', [[Cassius Dio]] makes reference to the Psylli as being sought out by [[Octavian]] to draw out the snake venom with which [[Cleopatra]] had poisoned herself (LI.14).{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} According to Dio{{who}}, the Psylli were completely immune to snake bites and were all male.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

It is claimed that the Psylli employed tests by animals in order to find out if their offspring was genuine and at the same time if their wives were faithful. Infant Psylli were subjected to snake-bites. If the infant died of the snakebite, illegitimacy was supposed to be implied.<ref name="1911enc"/>
