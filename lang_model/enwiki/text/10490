'''Frank Edward Secory''' ([[August 24]] [[1912]] - [[April 7]] [[1995]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[left fielder]] and [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played 186 games from 1940 to 1946 for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and [[Chicago Cubs]]. His best season was [[1944 in baseball|1944]], when he [[batting average|batted]] .321 in 22 games for the Cubs, the team for which he played nearly his entire career. In Game 6 of the [[1945 World Series]], with the Cubs tied 7-7 with the Tigers, he had a pinch-hit [[single (baseball)|single]] with one out in the 12th inning; a pinch runner later scored on a [[double (baseball)|double]] to give the Cubs an 8-7 win and send the Series to a seventh game.

Secory was born in [[Mason City, Iowa]], and moved in his youth to [[Michigan]]; he graduated from [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan College]] with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1936.<ref name=TSN>{{cite book |title=The Sporting News Baseball Register |year=1964 |pages=pp. 378-79 }}</ref> After making his debut with the Tigers, having one [[at bat]] in 1940, he was waived by the team and selected by the Reds. His promising career was sidetracked, however, when he fractured his leg sliding into home on [[May 10]] of the following year while with the [[Syracuse Chiefs]]; he had been expected to shortly be promoted to the Reds. Despite missing three months, he ended the season with a .329 batting average and 15 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] in 31 games.<ref>''1942 National League Green Book'', p. 44.</ref> After his major league career ended with the Cubs in 1946, he became an umpire in the [[West Texas-New Mexico League]] in 1948 and the [[Texas League]] from 1949 to 1951.<ref name=Green1970>''1970 National League Green Book'', p. 30.</ref>

Secory became a [[National League]] umpire from 1952 to 1970, and worked in the [[World Series]] in [[1957 World Series|1957]], [[1959 World Series|1959]], [[1964 World Series|1964]] and [[1969 World Series|1969]], serving as crew chief in 1964. He also officiated in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in 1955, 1958, 1961 (second game), 1964, 1967 and 1970. He was the second base umpire on [[May 26]], [[1959 in baseball|1959]] when [[Harvey Haddix]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] pitched a [[perfect game]] for 12 innings before allowing a baserunner and eventually losing in the 13th;<ref>{{cite book |last=Coberly |first=Rich |title=The No-Hit Hall of Fame: No-Hitters of the 20th Century |year=1985 |publisher=Triple Play |location=Newport Beach, CA |isbn=0-934289-00-X |pages=p. 111 }}</ref> he was again at second base on [[June 21]], [[1964 in baseball|1964]] when [[Jim Bunning]] pitched a perfect game for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the first official regular-season perfect game since 1922.<ref>Coberly, p. 127.</ref>

In all, Secory umpired in nine official [[no-hitter]]s in his career, which set a National League record for umpires and was then one short of the major league record held by [[Silk O'Loughlin]]. Secory tied [[Bob Emslie]]'s NL record of eight no-hitters on [[May 1]], [[1969 in baseball|1969]] when he worked second base in [[Don Wilson (baseball player)|Don Wilson]]'s 4-0 gem<ref>Coberly, p. 146.</ref>; after [[Augie Donatelli]] also tied the record later that year, Secory broke it by working in his ninth no-hitter on [[June 12]], [[1970 in baseball|1970]], officiating at first base in [[Dock Ellis]]' 2-0 win.<ref>Coberly, p. 151.</ref> After Secory's retirement, Donatelli tied his record in 1972, and [[Tom Gorman (umpire)|Tom Gorman]] tied it in 1976 before [[Paul Pryor]] broke it upon working in his 10th no-hitter in 1978. Secory was also behind the plate on [[May 26]], [[1956 in baseball|1956]] when three [[Cincinnati Reds]] pitchers held the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee Braves]] hitless for nine innings before losing in the 10th; it was the first time in major league history that multiple pitchers combined to throw nine innings without allowing a hit.<ref>Coberly, p. 103.</ref> He was again at second base for the second game of a doubleheader at [[Shea Stadium]] on [[May 31]], [[1964 in baseball|1964]], between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[San Francisco Giants]], when the two teams battled for 23 innings before the Giants won 8-6, setting a record for the longest game ever at 7 hours 23 minutes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Joseph J.|title=Baseball's Benchmark Boxscores|year=1990|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn= 0-89950-488-4|pages=pp. 142-44}}</ref>
