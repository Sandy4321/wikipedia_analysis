'''Reedy Island Range Rear Lighthouse''' is a [[lighthouse]] in [[Delaware]], 
[[United States]], on the south end of [[Reedy Island]] on the [[Delaware River]], near [[Port Penn]], [[Delaware]]. The Reedy Island Range Front Light is 2.8 miles north on a 22 ft [[skeletal tower]]

==History==
The original Reedy Island light was built in 1839. It was a 44 foot round brick tower and 2 story keeper<U+2019>s house. The light was reactivated in 1879 and a square tower was placed on top of the original dwelling. The light was discontinued permanently in 1950. The structure was destroyed by fire in 2002. A [[skeletal tower]] still stands near the original sight of the lighthouse. The tower is an active aid to navigation
