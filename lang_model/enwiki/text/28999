''[[CBC News]]'', ''[[The Fifth Estate]]'', "Fasten Your Seatbelts: Ben Gurion Airport in Israel", 2007. Accessed June 2, 2008.</ref>

Because [[airport security]] was focused on the possibility of a [[Palestinian]] attack, the use of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] terrorists took the guards by surprise. The attack has often been described as a [[suicide]] mission, but it has also been asserted that it was the outcome of a larger operation (the particulars of which remain unpublicized) that went awry.<ref>[http://neojaponisme.com/2007/09/13/steinhoffpartfour/ Interview: Dr. Patricia Steinhoff 4] ''Neojaponisme'', September 13, 2007. Accessed March 22, 2009.</ref> The three perpetrators<U+2014>[[Kozo Okamoto]], [[Tsuyoshi Okudaira]], and [[Yasuyuki Yasuda]]<U+2014>had been trained in [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]]; the actual planning was handled by [[Wadie Haddad]] (a.k.a. Abu Hani), head of [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations|PFLP External Operations]], with some input from Okamoto.<ref>Interview: Dr. Patricia Steinhoff 4</ref>

== Attack ==
The men arrived at the airport aboard an [[Air France]] flight from [[Paris]]. Dressed conservatively and carrying slim violin cases, they attracted little attention. Entering the waiting area, they opened up their violin cases and produced Czech [[Vz 58]] assault rifles with the butt stocks removed.  Immediately afterwards, they began to fire indiscriminately at airport staff and visitors, killing twenty-four people and injuring seventy-eight others. The victims included sixteen Christian pilgrims from [[Puerto Rico]], and professor [[Aharon Katzir]], an internationally renowned [[protein]] [[biophysics|biophysicist]], whose brother, [[Ephraim Katzir]], would be elected [[President of Israel]] the following year. Yasuda and Okudaira died at the scene, Yasuda from Israeli fire and Okudaira by his own hand&mdash;he had moved from the airport building onto the landing area, after firing at passengers disembarking from an [[El Al]] aircraft&mdash;and committed [[suicide]] using a grenade. Okamoto was severely injured but survived and was captured.<ref>Schreiber, p. 215.</ref>

== Aftermath ==
The Japanese public initially reacted with disbelief to initial reports that the perpetrators of the massacre were Japanese until a Japanese embassy official sent to the hospital confirmed that Okamoto was a Japanese national.  Okamoto told the diplomat that he had nothing personal against the Israeli people, but that he had to do what he did because, "It was my duty as a soldier of the revolution."<ref>Schreiber, p. 215<U+2013>216.</ref>  Okamoto then asked the diplomat, "Hasn't my father committed suicide yet?" (He had not.)  Okamoto was tried by Israeli courts and sentenced to life imprisonment in June 1972.<ref>Schreiber, p. 216</ref>

In the letter claiming official responsibility for the attack carried out by the [[Japanese Red Army]], the PFLP referred to it as ''Operation Deir Yassin''. This was to portray it as revenge for the 1948 [[Deir Yassin massacre]] by Jewish [[Irgun]] members. The letter also stated that the operation was carried out by the ''Squad of the Martyr Patrick Arguello''. [[Patrick Arguello]] had been killed two years earlier, on [[September 6]], [[1970]] on an Israeli [[El Al]] jet he had attempted to hijack together with PFLP member [[Leila Khaled]].

Okamoto was released in 1985 with over a thousand other prisoners in an exchange for captured Israeli soldiers. He settled in [[Lebanon]]'s [[Bekaa Valley]]. He was arrested in 1997, but in 2000 was granted political [[refugee]] status in Lebanon. Four other JRA members arrested at the same time were [[extradition|extradited]] to [[Japan]].

In June 2006, a legislative initiative by [[Puerto Rico]] Senator [[Jos<U+00E9> Garriga Pic<U+00F3>]], Senate Project (PS) 1535, was approved by unanimous vote of both houses of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]], making every May 30 "Lod Massacre Remembrance Day". On August 2, 2006, the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], [[An<U+00ED>bal Acevedo Vil<U+00E1>]], signed it into law as [http://www.lexjuris.com/LEXLEX/Leyes2006/lexl2006144.htm Law 144 August 2, 2006]. The purpose of "Lod Remembrance Day" is to commemorate those events, to honor both those murdered and those who survived, and to educate the Puerto Rican public against terrorism. On May 30, 2007, the event was officially memorialized in Puerto Rico after 35 years.

On 8 July 1972 [[Ghassan Kanafani]], Palestinian short story writer and spokesperson for the PFLP, was killed in retaliation for the attack. His niece also died in the [[Beirut]] car bomb.
