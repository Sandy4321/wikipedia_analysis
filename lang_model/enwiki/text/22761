The '''Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge''' (formerly the '''North Channel Bridge''') located in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Queens]], is a bridge that runs south from [[Howard Beach, Queens|Howard Beach]], crosses the Grassy Bay portion of [[Jamaica Bay]] to [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]]. The bridge is named for the late [[Joseph Patrick Addabbo|Joseph P. Addabbo]], who represented the area in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1961 to 1986.<ref>{{cite news |title=Addabbo to Be Sworn At 'Father's Bridge' |first=Howard |last=Schwach |url=http://www.rockawave.com/news/2002-01-05/Society/Addabbo_To_Be_Sworn_At_Fathers_Bridge.html |newspaper=The Wave
 |date=January 5, 2002 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

The bridge was built alongside the North Channel Bridge as a replacement; a lack of maintenance on the old bridge had allowed it to deteriorate to the point where it was beyond repair.<ref>{{cite news |title=Despite Perception, New York City Is on the Mend |first=Alan |last=Finder |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/27/nyregion/despite-perception-new-york-city-is-on-the-mend.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 27, 1989 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>

The Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge is owned and operated by the [[New York City Department of Transportation]].
