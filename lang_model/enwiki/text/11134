'''Barbara L''' (1947<U+2013>1977) was an [[American Quarter Horse]] that raced during the early 1950s and often defeated some of the best racehorses of the time.<ref name=Nye/> She earned $32,836 (about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|32834|1955|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) on the race track in 81&nbsp;starts and 21&nbsp;wins, including six&nbsp;wins in [[stakes race]]s. She set two track records during her racing career. After retiring from racing in 1955, she went on to become a [[broodmare]] and had 14&nbsp;foals, including 11 who earned their [[American Quarter Horse Association#Racing|Race Register of Merit]] with the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (AQHA). Her offspring earned more than $200,000 in race money. She died in 1977 and was inducted into the AQHA's [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame]] in 2007.

==Early life== 

Barbara L was foaled in 1947, a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] daughter of a [[Thoroughbred]] stallion named Patriotic and a Quarter Horse broodmare named Big Bess. She was registered with the AQHA as number 146,954.<ref name=StudBook/> Her sire, or father, was a grandson of [[Man o' War (horse)|Man o' War]], while her dam, or mother, descended from the Quarter Horse [[Peter McCue (horse)|Peter McCue]].<ref name=Nye/> Barbara L was registered as bred by James Hunt of [[Sonora, Texas]], and her owner at the time of registration was A. B. Green, of [[Purcell, Oklahoma]].<ref name=StudBook>American Quarter Horse Association ''Official Stud Book and Registry'' Volume 15 p. 393</ref>

As a yearling, Barbara L was sold at auction for $140 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|140|1948|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} to a Mr.&nbsp;Lumpkin, who sold [[horse trailer]]s for a living. She spent the next period of her life demonstrating trailers across Texas before someone suggested that Lumpkin race her.<ref name=Nye>Nye ''Great Moments in Quarter Horse Racing History'' pp. 91<U+2013>95</ref> Lumpkin changed her name from "Anthem" to "Barbara L" in honor of his daughter Barbara, who was the filly's first trainer.<ref name=BL/>

==Racing career==

Barabara L's first race was in 1949 at [[Del Rio, Texas]], where she came in fourth and only rated a B [[speed index]] (a measure of how fast a horse ran in a race). She didn't win a race until her third start that year, completing a {{convert|440|yd|m}} course in 23.4&nbsp;seconds. In the following years, she raced at Centennial Race Track in Colorado; at Raton in New Mexico; at Albuquerque, New Mexico; at Phoenix, Arizona; at [[Los Alamitos Race Course|Los Alamitos Race Track]] in California; and at Bay Meadows Race Track. She raced for Lumpkin until 1952, when she was sold to A. B. Green.{{efn|The American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame says that she was sold in 1951, for $3,500 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3500|1951|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}<ref name=BL/> The AQHA does not list Lumpkin as an owner at all, just listing Hunt as the breeder and Green as the owner, and giving 1947 as the date of Green's ownership.<ref name=Own>American Quarter Horse Association ''Ownership Record for Barbara L''</ref> AQHA computer records for the early years of the organization do not always contain all information available, as the information was computerized in the late 1960s.<ref name=Burke>Burke "[[Garrett's Miss Pawhuska]]" ''Quarter Horse Journal'' p. 492</ref>}} Green raced her until May&nbsp;1955, when her last start was recorded with the AQHA.<ref name=Dam/>

Barbara L raced for seven years, starting 81&nbsp;times. She ended her career on the track with 21&nbsp;victories, 23&nbsp;seconds and nine third-place finishes.<ref name=Digest>Wagoner ''Quarter Racing Digest'' p. 68</ref> During her racing career, she beat a number of the top racehorses of her time: Stella Moore, Blob Jr, Bart BS, Johnny Dial, and Monita.<ref name=Nye/> She won six stakes races, placed second in four, and came in third in three. Her earnings on the racetrack were $32,836 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|32836|1955|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}} The stakes wins were the Speedwell Handicap, the Del Rio Feature, the Bart BS Stakes, the Miss Princess Invitational Handicap, Maddon's Bright Eyes Handicap, and the Pima County Fair Premier Stakes.<ref name=Dam>American Quarter Horse Association ''Official Produce of Dam Record for Barbara L''</ref> She set two track records<U+2014>one at Centennial for {{convert|400|yd|m}} with 20.2&nbsp;seconds, the other at Los Alamitos for {{convert|400|yd|m}} with 20.5&nbsp;seconds<U+2014>and equaled the {{convert|350|yd|m|adj=on}} track record at Los Alamitos with a 18.5&nbsp;second run. The AQHA awarded her a [[American Quarter Horse Association#Racing|Race Register of Merit]] and a [[American Quarter Horse Association#Racing|Superior Race Horse]] award.<ref name=Dam/>

==Broodmare career==

As a broodmare, Barbara L produced eleven [[foal]]s who earned their Race Register of Merit with the AQHA.  Four of her foals earned speed ratings of AAAT, which would translate to speed indexes of 100 or better in current usage.<ref name=Digest/> She had 14&nbsp;foals; they started 230&nbsp;times on the racetrack, winning 52&nbsp;races and earning $262,042 (approximately ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|262042|1965|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in races. Two of her foals won Superior Race Horse Awards: Cuter Yet, and Mr Walt. Her leading money earner was Barbara&nbsp;3, who earned more than $100,000.<ref name=Dam/>{{Inflation-fn|US}}

Barbara L's first foal was Mr. Bruce, a chestnut stallion foaled in 1956 and sired by the Thoroughbred stallion [[Three Bars]]. He started 25&nbsp;races, of which he won six, earning $8,283 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|8283|1959|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) on the track.

Polly Jane, a bay mare sired by [[Go Man Go]], was Barbara L's 1958 foal.

Barbara L's next two foals, Go Doctor and Barbara&nbsp;1, did not race, but the foal born in 1963, Barbara L's Boy, started 12&nbsp;times and won twice. He was sired by Depth Bars and won $1,312 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1312|1967|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) and earned a AAA speed index.

Her best speed index was AAAT and she earned $100,692 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|100692|1967|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Barbara L's next foal, in 1965, was Top Decker, a brown stallion also by Top Deck. He started five&nbsp;times and earned a AAA&nbsp;speed index and $98 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|98|1969|r=-1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Barbara L did not have a foal in 1966, but in 1967 she had a bay mare named Cuter Yet by [[Jet Deck]]. Cuter Yet started 27&nbsp;races and won 5&nbsp;times, including 2&nbsp;stakes races.
