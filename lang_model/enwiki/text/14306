'''''Mighty Jill Off''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[Independent video game development|independently developed]] [[freeware]] [[video game]]  designed by [[Anna Anthropy]], with art by James Harvey and music by Andrew Toups. It stars a [[bottom (BDSM)|submissive]] named Jill, who has a [[boot fetishism|boot fetish]] and is forced to climb up a tower after her Queen kicks her down it as punishment. Jill does this by jumping and gliding past obstacles. Jill can be defeated in one hit by these obstacles, but will return to the last check point. The game serves as an homage to the 1986 arcade game ''[[Mighty Bomb Jack]]''.

The game's [[BDSM]] and [[lesbian]] themes were implemented by Anthropy, a lesbian BDSM practitioner, for the purpose of providing legitimate "dykes" in video games. She also made the game difficult, to fit in with its BDSM theme. ''Mighty Jill Off'' has received praise for its BDSM themes from critics of websites such as [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] and Game Set Watch. It was also praised for its high level of difficulty by editors of [[GamesRadar]] and Bitmob. [[1UP.com]] included it in its list of favourite free PC games of 2009.

==Gameplay and scenario==

''Mighty Jill Off'' incorporates several BDSM themes. It stars a [[bottom (BDSM)|submissive]] [[lesbian]] named Jill who has a [[boot fetishism|boot fetish]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Shoemaker |first=Brad |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/super-meat-boy/61-25114/|title=Super Meat Boy (video game )|publisher=[[Giant Bomb]] |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> She is kicked to the bottom of her Queen's tower for acting like a "greedy [[slut]]". Jill attempts to climb back up the tower and return to her Queen; once there, she is given affection, constricted and [[Gag (BDSM)#Ball|gagged]], and made to do it again.

Some of ''Mighty Jill Off''{{'}}s gameplay is borrowed from the 1986 arcade game ''[[Mighty Bomb Jack]]'', such as the jumping mechanics, as a tribute to it.<ref name="rps">{{cite web |last=Gillen |first=Kieron |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/09/17/whip-it-mighty-jill-off/ |title=Whip It: Mighty Jill Off |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> Players control Jill in three ways: moving, jumping, and gliding.

==Development==
''Mighty Jill Off'' was designed by [[Anna Anthropy]], also known as Auntie Pixelante, in 2008. It was also developed by James Harvey and Andrew Toups, who provided the artwork and music for the game, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mighty Jill Off |url=http://mightyjilloff.dessgeega.com/ |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> Anthropy designed ''Mighty Jill Off'' to feature "dykes and perverts" to make up for "the distinct lack of real dyke characters and dyke desire in games". She argued that while "supposed dykes" are seen in commercials, these characters are "written and drawn by men". She said that "they don't look like us, they don<U+2019>t express themselves like us, they don<U+2019>t lust like us."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lesbiangamers.com/2008/11/anna-anthropy-interview-auntie-pixelante-is-in-the-house/ |title=Anna Anthropy interview <U+2013> Auntie Pixelante is in the house! |publisher=Lesbian Gamers |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> Anthropy compared the challenge of players who lead Jill through the game as similar to the challenges of a top who leads the bottom through a scene.<ref name="eegra">{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Patrick |url=http://www.eegra.com/pages/show/title/22_09_2008_Interview__Anna__Dessgeega__Anthropy/ |title=Interview: Anna <U+2018>Dessgeega<U+2019> Anthropy |publisher=Eegra |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

===Art design===
While the character artwork for ''Mighty Jill Off'' was created by James Harvey, Anthropy first designed Jill in sprite form. Harvey was initially wary of doing work that was [[BDSM]]-themed; he felt that it was easy for something that is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used the Japanese [[harem anime]] genre as an example. He added that there is a "fine line" between "cute and funny" and "repulsive". He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way that people in the BDSM community could identify with it, while also avoiding putting people off who were not into BDSM. He used European comics as a model for his art work, which he admired for the "permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons". He also cited as inspiration specific Japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as [[Monkey Punch]], the creator of ''[[Lupin III]]''.<ref name="hj"/>

Harvey designed the Queen based on a loose description by Anthropy. He wanted to make her "sexy and authoritative" and to look like a "fully grown human with relatively realistic proportions". <ref name="hj">{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=James |url=http://harveyjames.livejournal.com/74943.html |title= Mighty Jill Off |publisher=James Harvey |date=2008-03-15 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> He designed her to be an "amalgamation of every lesbian friend" he had been "secretly been attracted to".<ref name="hj2"/> He initially designed her with a veil, but felt that this was too superfluous and girly; he decided to adorn her with spikes instead.<ref name="hj3"/> He attempted to design the title screen's background to "emphasise the drama of [the] situation, or to expressionistically[sic] symbolise the characters in the scene". However, there were some hurdles; he originally envisioned the Queen's tower to be a smooth, straight one, but felt that it would be too [[phallus|phallic]], which would be meaningless symbolism given the game's content.<ref name="hj3">{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=James |url=http://harveyjames.livejournal.com/76939.html |title=Mighty Jill Off - PART 3 |publisher=James Harvey |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> Anthropy and Harvey held a contest for people to contribute fan art for the game; the five winners won hand-made ''Mighty Jill Off'' activity books, which included activities such as creating make-out partners for a group of "repulsive, tongue-waggling oafs", as well as writing a poem for the game's Queen. He scanned one of the books and posted it online, allowing others to contribute and send in their drawings. The book features several BDSM-related themes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caoili |first=Eric |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/04/mighty_jill_off_activity_books.php |title=Mighty Jill Off Activity Books |publisher=GameSetWatch |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

Harvey was split between two designs for Jill. He either wanted to depict her as a "funny little [[Mega Man|megaman]] character" or a grown woman; however, both approaches had their own pitfalls. He felt that the former could come off as too much like Japanese [[lolicon]]-styled art, while the latter could make the story seem too serious. The Queen's more realistic design made him question whether a child-like Jill would be appropriate.<ref name="hj"/> He designed several versions of Jill with different proportions and sent them to Anthropy so she could pick her favourite. He compared two of the designs to [[Nintendo]] characters [[Mario]] and [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]]; the Mario-like design he called a "standard video game design", while the Link-like design he called "slightly realistic". The Link-like design was the most realistic design that he did because he felt that making it too realistic could make it too difficult for players to identify with, and could diminish the humorous elements of the game.<ref name="hj"/> He also intended to design her as "dumpy and podgy" to make her more "lovable".<ref name="hj"/>

Anthropy told Harvey that she preferred characters with more realistic proportions; as a result, he ended up with a design that was three and a half heads tall. Due to her submissive position, he designed her to be an "innocent" who looked "eager-to-please", with "benign, wide eyed facial expressions".<ref name="hj2">{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=James |url=http://harveyjames.livejournal.com/76055.html |title= Unseen Jill Off - Part 2 |publisher=James Harvey |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> The evolution of her design resulted in Harvey having to redesign her appearance on the title screen.<ref name="hj3"/> He employed different colors to demonstrate Jill's feelings for the Queen; he used a rose tint to demonstrate her "blissful display of affection" while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness.<ref name="hj3"/> Harvey intended to add some red to her [[latex clothing|rubber body suit]] order to make her stand out from the background; however, he felt that this made the suit look more like a "crazy wrestler costume".<ref name="hj"/> He later thought to include grey in the design or to put her initials on her chest, but decided on using an all black design. One of the difficulties of designing the suit was to make it look shiny without resembling "gross lolicon manga porn".<ref name="hj2"/>

===Follow-ups===
A harder version called ''Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition'', was released in October 2008, 8 months after the original version.<ref name="jo"/> Anthropy compared it to the Nintendo game ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'' which was noticeably more difficult than its predecessor, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' She made it with the intention of reusing assets from the original game such as sprites and backgrounds but making sure that none of the challenges were recycled.<ref name="AAjoh"/> She also made a follow-up called ''Jill Off with One Hand'', which features "OneSwitch" gameplay, a type of gameplay which requires only one button to play.<ref name="ap">{{cite web |last=Anthropy |first=Anna |authorlink=Anna Anthropy |url=http://www.auntiepixelante.com/?p=334 |title=jill off with one hand |publisher=Anna Anthropy |date=2008-11-29 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=Barrie |url=http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/ |title=Fun enabling technology and ideas |publisher=One Switch |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> It was created over the course of [[Buy Nothing Day]] and was created with the intent of making it playable on mobile phones.<ref name="ap"/> The protagonist Jill was featured in the 2010 platform game ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'' along with several characters from other games.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caoili |first=Eric |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/10/fetus_juice_indie_cameos_in_su.php |title=Fetus Juice, Indie Cameos In Super Meat Boy Launch Trailer |publisher=GameSetWatch |date=2010-10-20 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

''Mighty Jill Off'' has received generally positive reception. [[1UP Shows and Podcasts#Retronauts|Retronauts]]' Jess Ragan praised Anthropy for her understanding of what made ''[[Mighty Bomb Jack]]'' good.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ragan |first=Jess |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9036826 |title=Spectrum Analyzer: Bomb Jack |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2010-07-11 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> [[1UP.com]]'s Scott Sharkey listed ''Mighty Jill Off'' as one of his favourite independently-developed freeware games in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sharkey |first=Scott |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3174065 |title=101 Free Games 2009: The Best Free Games on the Web from |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> [[Gamasutra]] listed it as one of their runner-ups for the top five best indie games of 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21369 |title=Gamasutra's Best Of 2008: Top 5 Indie Games |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> On two separate occasions, IndieGames' timw listed ''Mighty Jill Off'' as "game picks"; first for the original version, and second for ''Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition''.<ref name="playtime">{{cite web|author=timw |url=http://www.indiegames.com/2008/03/freeware_game_pick_mighty_jill.html |title=The Weblog - Freeware Game Pick: Mighty Jill Off (dessgeega) |publisher=IndieGames |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref><ref name="jo">{{cite web|author=timw |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/10/best_of_indie_games_ready_set.php |title=Best Of Indie Games: Ready, Set, Jill Off |publisher=GameSetWatch |date=2008-10-25 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> [[GamesRadar]]'s Nathan Meuiner listed the game as one of the "most ruthlessly punishing indie games" and wrote that the difficulty level may make players question whether the "pain of a million deaths is worth the pleasure awaiting" players.<ref>{{cite web |last=Meuiner |first=Nathan |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/most-ruthlessly-punishing-indie-games/a-20090715101323206077/p-3 |title=Most ruthlessly punishing indie games |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> Bitmob's James DeRosa called it "tough-as-s***" and gave credit to Anthropy for coining the genre "masocore".<ref name="bitmob">{{cite web|last=DeRosa |first=James |url=http://www.bitmob.com/articles/five-indie-games-referenced-in-super-meat-boy-that-will-beat-your-face-into-a-meaty-bloody-pulp |title=5 Tough-As-S*** Indie Games Referenced in Super Meat Boy |publisher=Bitmob.com |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

The game has also received praise for its insight into BDSM and the dom/sub relationship. [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'s Kieron Gillen called it an "interesting examination of the master/slave relationship".<ref name="rps"/> Rock Paper Shotgun's Alec Meer described it as a "wry, subversive examination of why videogame protagonists put themselves through a torturous amount of struggle to reach their objectives".<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/08/03/dont-squeal-piggy-when-pigs-fly/ |title=Don<U+2019>t Squeal, Piggy: When Pigs Fly |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> James DeRosa praised Anthropy for her implementation of elements and ideas that most games do not cover and called it a "hypersexualized, bondage-themed platformer" which Anthropy uses to explore the "power dynamics of sexuality and the hegemony of male and female sex roles in video games -- as well as the significance of difficulty and reward as a design method".<ref name="bitmob"/>
