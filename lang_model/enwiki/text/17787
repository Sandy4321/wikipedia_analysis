{{nihongo|''' Saig<U+014D> Tsugumichi'''|<U+897F><U+90F7><U+5F93><U+9053>|also read '''Saig<U+014D> J<U+016B>d<U+014D>'''}} ([[1 June]][[1843]]<U+2013>[[18 July]][[1902]]) was a [[Meiji period|Meiji-period]] politician and military officer.  

Born in Shimokajich<U+014D>, [[Kagoshima]], the son of the ''[[samurai]]'' Saig<U+014D> Kichibe of the [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]] domain, his siblings, among others, included his famous older brother [[Saig<U+014D> Takamori]]. He had many names throughout his life.  Besides the two listed above, he also sometimes went by the nickname "Shing<U+014D>".  His real name was "Ry<U+016B>k<U+014D>", or "Ry<U+016B>d<U+014D>".  It is also possible that he went by the name "Ry<U+016B>suke".

At the recommendation of [[Arimura Shunsai]], he became a tea-serving monk for the ''[[daimyo]]'' of Satsuma, [[Shimazu Nariakira]]. After he returned to secular life, he became one of a group of devoted followers of Arimura.  He partook in the [[Bombardment of Kagoshima|Anglo-Satsuma War]] and later fought in the [[Battle of Toba-Fushimi]] of the [[Boshin War]] to overthrow the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. In [[1869]], two years after the [[Meiji Restoration]], he went to Europe with [[Yamagata Aritomo]] to study European military organization.  In 1874, he became a [[lieutenant-general]] of the army, and commanded forces in the [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Taiwan Expedition]] in the same year.

In 1873, his brother Takamori resigned from the government, over the rejection of his proposal to invade [[Korea]].  Many others officials from the Satsuma region followed suit, however, J<U+016B>d<U+014D> continued to work for the government. Upon the death of his brother in the [[Satsuma Rebellion]], J<U+016B>d<U+014D> became the leader of Satsuma. In accord with the [[Kazoku]] system enacted in 1884, he received the title of [[count]].  

He held a string of important positions for the [[Ito Hirobumi]] cabinet, such as [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Minister of the Navy]] and Minister of Internal Affairs.  In 1892, he was appointed to the [[Privy Council]] as a ''[[genr<U+014D>]]. '' In the same year, he also founded a political party known as "Kokumin Ky<U+014D>kai" (<U+56FD><U+6C11><U+5354><U+4F1A>, The People's Co-operative Party).  In 1894, he became an [[admiral]], and was given the title of [[marquis]].  In 1898, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] bestowed upon him the honorary title of "[[Admiral of the Fleet (Japan)|fleet admiral]]".  He died in 1902.

* After the Meiji Restoration, he went to a government office to register his name.  He intended to register orally under his given name Ry<U+016B>k<U+014D> (alternately Ry<U+016B>d<U+014D>).  However, the civil servant misheard his name as "J<U+016B>d<U+014D>", and he therefore became "J<U+016B>d<U+014D>" under the law.  He didn't particularly mind, so he never bothered to change it back.  The name "Tsugumichi" arose as an alternate, (and to the Japanese, more natural-sounding), pronunciation for the characters of his name: <U+5F93><U+9053>.

* Although he was said to be as kind-hearted and generous as his brother Takamori and his cousin [[Oyama Iwao|<U+014C>yama Iwao]], after the [[<U+014C>tsu Incident]]<U+2014>which occurred while he was working as Minister of Internal Affairs<U+2014>he pushed for the death penalty of [[Tsuda Sanz<U+014D>]] and threatened [[Kojima Korekata]].

* Because he resembled his brother Takamori, Takamori's photograph was referenced when drawing portraits of J<U+016B>d<U+014D>.

* He owned a cottage in Yanagihara (present-day [[Numazu]]), [[Shizuoka Prefecture]].

* His former residence (once located in [[Meguro]], Tokyo) is registered as an [[Important Cultural Property]] by the Japanese government, and is now located at the [[Meiji-mura]] historical park outside of [[Inuyama]], [[Aichi Prefecture]].

* He was the first person in Japan to own a race horse.
