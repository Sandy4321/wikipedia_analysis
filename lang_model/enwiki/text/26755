"'''Flaming Moe's'''" is the tenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on November 21, 1991.<ref name="officialsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0310.htm|title=Flaming Moe's|accessdate=2009-01-03|publisher=The Simpsons.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822165728/http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0310.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}</ref> In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] tells [[Moe Szyslak]] of a secret alcoholic cocktail that includes [[cough syrup]] and fire that he calls "Flaming Homer". Moe steals the recipe from Homer, renames the drink the "Flaming Moe" and begins selling it at his tavern. The drink is a success and boosts business and patronage, but Homer is angry at Moe for his betrayal, and seeks revenge.

The episode was written by [[Robert Cohen (comedy writer)|Robert Cohen]] and directed by [[Rich Moore]], with assistance from [[Alan Smart]]. "Flaming Moe's" was one of the first episodes of the show to feature Moe in a prominent role. The main plot of the episode in which Moe's Tavern gets famous because of a drink is loosely based on the [[Los Angeles]] establishment [[Coconut Teaszer]]. The episode also parodies the television series ''[[Cheers]]'', including the theme song "[[Theme from Cheers (Where Everybody Knows Your Name)|Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]", and a character named Collette is modeled after [[Shelley Long]]'s character [[Diane Chambers]]. [[Catherine O'Hara]] originally recorded dialogue for the part of Colette, but the writers felt her voice did not fit the role and instead used a track recorded by regular [[Jo Ann Harris]].

American rock band [[Aerosmith]] ([[Steven Tyler]], [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], [[Brad Whitford]], [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] and [[Joey Kramer]]) appears in the episode. They were the first band to make a guest appearance on the show. Their dialogue was recorded in [[Boston]] with [[Hank Azaria]], the voice of Moe, who flew over to record his part with them and help them with their lines.

The episode has been well-received by critics and has been included in best ''Simpsons'' episode lists by [[IGN]], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[AskMen.com]] and [[AOL]]. In its original airing during the November [[sweeps]] period, the episode had a 14.4 [[Nielsen rating]] and finished the week ranked 29th.

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] visits [[Moe's Tavern]] one night, where he finds [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] is in serious financial trouble, having been unable to make his beer payment. Homer tells him about a drink recipe that he accidentally invented one night, called the "Flaming Homer". He explains that after [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]] made the Simpson family watch slides from their latest vacation, he was unable to find a beer. He decided to mix together drops of [[liquor]] from near-empty bottles and accidentally included a bottle of Krusty Brand non-narcotic [[cough syrup]]. When Patty dropped cigarette ash in the drink and set it on fire, Homer discovered that fire greatly enhanced the taste of the drink.

Moe tries making Homer's drink, and gives it to a complaining customer, who loves it. When the customer asks what the drink is called, Homer starts to respond, but Moe butts in and calls it a "Flaming Moe". Word of mouth spreads, and Moe sees his business boom because of the drink. To help out with the extra customers, he hires a waitress named Colette. Moe's Tavern, renamed "Flaming Moe's", soon becomes one of the trendiest nightspots in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and [[Aerosmith]]'s new hangout. Homer becomes angry with Moe and vows never to return to the tavern. He subsequently becomes obsessed with Moe and his betrayal, even having a hallucination where he sees Moe's face everywhere.

A restaurant chain becomes interested in purchasing the recipe for the drink, of which they have managed to identify all but the [[secret ingredient]] (cough syrup). A representative offers Moe $1,000,000, but he refuses. Colette discovers that Moe stole the recipe from Homer and convinces him to sell the drink and give half of the money to him. Later, as Moe is about to accept the deal&nbsp;<U+2014> and share half of the money with Homer&nbsp;<U+2014> Homer, unhinged by resentment, arrives at the tavern. He gets his revenge on Moe by revealing to everyone in the bar that the secret ingredient is ordinary cough syrup. The representative quickly retracts the offer and leaves.

Within one week, nearly all restaurants in Springfield are serving "Flaming Moes", and Moe's business has gone back to the way it was before. Homer stops in and he and Moe reconcile. Moe gives Homer a "Flaming Homer" on the house.

It was the height of the insanity of the cartoon era, for me the equivalent of when we did "[[Walk This Way]]" with [[Run-DMC]] during the beginning of that era of rap.

The main plot of the episode in which Moe's Tavern gets famous because of a drink is loosely based on the [[Los Angeles]] establishment [[Coconut Teaszer]].<ref name="Jean"/> According to IGN, "Flaming Moe's" was "one of the first [episodes] to really give Moe the spotlight."<ref name="IGN"/> There was originally a joke in the episode in which a gay couple walked into "Flaming Moe's", assuming that it was a [[gay bar]] because of the name.<ref name="Jean"/> [[Matt Groening]] feels that it was a good thing the joke was cut because he did not feel the writers should bring attention to the name.<ref name="Groening"/>

[[Catherine O'Hara]] originally agreed to provide the voice of Collette the waitress, and went into the studio and recorded her part for the character.<ref name="Castellaneta">Castellaneta, Dan.

American rock band [[Aerosmith]] were the first band to make a guest appearance on the show.<ref name="IGN"/> The writers had heard that the band had wanted to appear in an episode, so they wrote the guest spot for them.<ref name="Jean"/> According to Al Jean, they later found out that part of the reason why Aerosmith agreed to appear was the drink being called the "Flaming Moe".<ref name="Jean"/> The band was recorded in [[Boston]], and [[Hank Azaria]], the voice of Moe, flew over to record his part with them and help them with their lines.<ref name="Jean"/> In the original script, Moe tempted the band to play by offering them free beer, but the band members asked that the joke be changed. The writers changed the line to "free pickled eggs."<ref name="Jean"/> The band is shown sitting at a table with a bearded man, who is modeled after their [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] man [[John Kalodner]]. One of the stipulations from the band was to include him in the episode. Kalodner also received a "special thanks to" credit at the end of the episode.<ref name="Reiss"/> Aerosmith's song "Young Lust" from the album ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'' plays over the end credits. According to Al Jean, the band recorded a special shortened version of the song just for the episode.<ref name="Jean"/>

The episode was directed by [[Rich Moore]] and [[Alan Smart]].

==Cultural references==
The basic premise of the episode is similar to the film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> Several references are made to the sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''. Collette the waitress is a parody of ''Cheers'' character [[Diane Chambers]], and the "theme sequence" for Flaming Moe's, is a direct parody of the famous ''Cheers'' theme.

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it "Possibly the best Simpsons episode, with a constant stream of gags, inspired animation (in particular the sequence when Homer begins to see and hear Moe everywhere, from Maggie's gurgles to the leaves on the trees), and a superb plot that twists about in every direction but the one you might expect."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote "From Lisa<U+2019>s slumber party at the opening through the Cheers spoof at Moe<U+2019>s, this episode<U+2019>s another real winner. Homer gets some of his all-time best lines, including a great run where he mocks Marge<U+2019>s attempts to have him accept his fate.

In 2006, [[IGN]] named "Flaming Moe's" the best episode of the third season. They wrote, "This episode has tons of standout moments, from the appearance by Aerosmith (the first time a musical act of that caliber appeared as themselves on the series); a funny payoff for all of Bart's prank calls to Moe's, when a man named Hugh Jass actually does turn out to be a customer; a deftly done Cheers parody at the height of Moe's success; and Homer turning into a Phantom of the Opera type lunatic."<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/731/731095p1.html|title=The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes|author=Goldman, Eric; Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-09-08|accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> In ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2003 list of the top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episodes ever, it was placed sixteenth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_4,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2010-01-04|date=2003-01-29|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> In 2003, Rich Weir of [[AskMen.com]] placed the episode in second on his list of his ten favorite episodes of the show.
