==Traditions==

Awards Night
Held in late spring to honor the academic, athletic, and community achievements of Upper School students. 

Commencement 
Usually the first or second Thursday of June; held in the afternoon. Graduates wear long white dresses and carry flowers. 

Lumina: A Celebration of Light 
Previously called Vespers.  This event sustains the beauty and pageantry of the Lincoln

Senior Dinner 
Held for seniors and their parents the evening before Commencement prior to Step-Singing. 

Silent Meeting       
In the manner of Friends, students and faculty in Middle and Upper School gather each week on Friday for Silent Meeting. Individuals may feel moved to speak, bringing a message of concern to the school community. Members of the senior class sit at the front on the 'facing bench,' and signal the end of meeting with the shaking of hands. The Lower School has similar gatherings for silent reflection. 

Step-Singing       
Held the evening before Commencement, this is one of the most beloved traditions. It is an exchange of songs (usually parodies of popular music, all reflecting a common theme) between the graduating class and the juniors.  It is held on the front steps of the school, and just before the seniors sing their last, most sentimental song, the juniors (who sing standing on the bottom step) change places with the seniors, who sing on the top one.
