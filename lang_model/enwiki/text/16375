'''Louise Erdrich''' (born '''Karen Louise Erdrich''', June 7, 1954, [[Little Falls, Minnesota]], United States)<ref name="Stookey1999">{{cite book|last=Stookey|first=Lorena Laura|title=Louise Erdrich: A Critical Companion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_YnPLIF8VbwC&pg=PA1|accessdate=7 November 2013|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313306129|pages=1<U+2013>}}</ref> is an American [[writer of novels]], [[poetry]], and [[children's books]] featuring [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] characters and settings.

Erdrich is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant writers of the second wave of the [[Native American Renaissance]]. In 2009, her novel ''The Plague of Doves'' was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] and also received an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.<ref>[http://www.anisfield-wolf.org/winners/winners-by-year/ The Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards -  Winners by Year]</ref> In November 2012, she received the [[National Book Award for Fiction]] for her novel ''[[The Round House (novel)|The Round House]]''.<ref name=nyt2012>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/us/louise-erdrichs-novel-the-round-house-wins-national-book-award.html |title=Novel About Racial Injustice Wins National Book Award |work=[[New York Times]] |author=Leslie Kaufman |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> She was married to author [[Michael Dorris]] and the two collaborated on a number of works.

She is also the owner of Birchbark Books, a small [[independent bookstore]] in [[Minneapolis]] that focuses on Native American literature and the Native community in the Twin Cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://birchBarkBooks.com/ |title=Birchbark Books & Native Arts &#124; Minneapolis, MN &#124; Welcome! |publisher=Birchbarkbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>

==Early and personal life==
Erdrich was born in [[Little Falls, Minnesota]], the first of seven children to Ralph Erdrich, a [[German-American]], and his wife Rita (''[[n<U+00E9>e]]'' Gourneau), half [[French-American]] and half [[Ojibwe]]. Both parents taught at a [[boarding school]] in [[Wahpeton, North Dakota]], set up by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], and her maternal grandfather, Patrick Gourneau, served as tribal chairman for the [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians]] for many years.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/louise-erdrich/10/ "Faces of America: Louise Erdrich"], PBS, ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' series, with Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], 2010.</ref> As a child, Erdrich's father paid her a nickel for every story she wrote.  Her sister Heidi is a poet who also lives in Minnesota and publishes under the name Heid E. Erdrich.<ref>See her website [http://heiderdrich.com/ ''Heid E. Erdrich''].</ref> Another sister, Lise Erdrich, has written children's books and collections of fiction and essays.

Erdrich attended [[Dartmouth College]] from 1972 to 1976 as part of its first [[co-ed]] class, and earned the [[A.B.]] in English. There she met her future husband, [[anthropologist]] and writer [[Michael Dorris]], then-director of the new [[Native American Studies]] program. Erdrich earned the [[Master of Arts]] in the [[Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars|Writing Seminars]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1979. 
Erdrich married Michael Dorris in 1981 and they raised three adopted children and three biological children until their separation in 1995 and Dorris' suicide in 1997. Erdrich lives in Minnesota.

She returned to Dartmouth in 2009 to receive an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctorate of Letters]] and to deliver the commencement address.<ref name="Interview">{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6055/the-art-of-fiction-no-208-louise-erdrich|title=Louise Erdrich, The Art of Fiction No. 208|work=[[Paris Review]]|author=Lisa Halliday|date=Winter 2010}}</ref>

Erdrich and her two sisters have hosted writers' workshops on the [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians#Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation|Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation]] in North Dakota.<ref>{{citation|publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=February 4, 2008|url=http://www.starTribune.com/entertainment/books/15083971.html|title=The Three Graces|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

==Work==
Her heritage from both parents is influential in all aspects of her life and prominent in her work.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/louise-erdrich]</ref>

In 1979 she wrote "The World's Greatest Fisherman", a short story about June Kashpaw, a divorced Ojibwe woman whose death by [[hypothermia]] brought her relatives home to a fictional North Dakota reservation for her funeral. It won the Nelson Algren Short Fiction prize and eventually became the first chapter of her debut novel, ''[[Love Medicine]]'', published by [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] in 1984.<ref name="Interview"/>

''Love Medicine'' won the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award.<ref name="Author: Louise Erdrich">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/about.aspx?authorid=2905 |title=Louise Erdrich: About the Author: HarperCollins Publishers |publisher=Harpercollins.com |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref> It has also been featured on the National Advanced Placement Test for Literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mseffie.com/AP/APtitles.html |title=AP Literature: Titles from Free Response Questions since 1971 |publisher=Mseffie.com |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref> Erdrich followed ''Love Medicine'' with ''The Beet Queen'' (1986), which continued her technique of using multiple narrators, yet surprised many critics by expanding the fictional reservation universe of ''Love Medicine'' to include the nearby town of Argus, North Dakota. Native characters are very much kept in the background in ''The Beet Queen'', while Erdrich focuses on the German-American community. The action of the novel takes place mostly before [[World War II]]. ''The Beet Queen'' was subject to a bitter attack from Native novelist [[Leslie Marmon Silko]], who accused Erdrich of being more concerned with [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] technique than with the political struggles of Native peoples.<ref>The controversy and fallout from this review, and some of its underlying themes, are reviewed in Susan Castillo's "Postmodernism, Native American Literature, and the Real: The Silko-Erdrich Controversy" in ''Notes from the Periphery: Marginality in North American Literature and Culture'' New York: Peter Lang, 1995. 179-190.</ref> However, Erdrich and Silko appear to have overcome that disagreement and are now on more friendly terms, possibly because Erdrich has more firmly cemented herself in the Native Community with her bookstore and printing press.

''[[Tracks (novel)|Tracks]]'' (1988) goes back to the early 20th century at the formation of the reservation and introduces the [[trickster]] figure of Nanapush, who owes a clear debt to ''[[Nanabozho]]''.<ref>There are many studies of the trickster figure in Erdrich's novels: A recent study that makes the connection between Nanabozho and Nanpush is "The Trickster and World Maintenance: An Anishinaabe Reading of Louise Erdrich's Tracks" by Lawrence W. Gross [http://onCampus.richmond.edu/faculty/ASAIL/SAIL2/173.html]</ref> Erdrich's novel most rooted in Anishinaabe culture (at least until ''Four Souls''), ''Tracks'' shows early clashes between traditional ways and the Roman Catholic Church. ''The Bingo Palace'' (1994) updates, yet does not resolve, various conflicts from ''Love Medicine''. Set in the 1980s, it describes the good and bad effects of a casino and a factory on the reservation community. Finally, ''Tales of Burning Love'' (1997) finishes the story of Sister Leopolda, a recurring character from all the previous books, and introduces a new set of white people into the reservation universe.
	 
''The Antelope Wife'' (1998), Erdrich's first novel after her divorce from Dorris, was the first of her novels to be set outside the continuity of the previous books.<ref>Lorena Laura Stookey, ''Louise Erdrich: A Critical Companion'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 ISBN 0-313-30612-5, ISBN 978-0-313-30612-9</ref> She subsequently returned to the reservation and nearby towns, and has published five novels since 1998 dealing with events in that fictional area. Among these are ''The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse'' (2001) and ''[[The Master Butchers Singing Club]]'' (2003), a macabre mystery that again draws on Erdrich's Native American and German-American heritage. Both novels have geographic and character connections with ''The Beet Queen''.  In 2009, Erdrich's novel ''[[The Plague of Doves]]'' was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. The narrative focuses on the historical lynching of four Native people wrongly accused of murdering a Caucasian family, and the effect of this injustice on the current generations. 
	 	
Erdrich's complexly interwoven series of novels have drawn comparisons with [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha]] novels.  Like Faulkner's, Erdrich's successive novels created multiple narratives in the same fictional area and combined the tapestry of local history with current themes and modern consciousness.<ref>See, e.g., Powell's Books (book review), ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 2, 2004</ref>

==Birchbark Books==
The bookstore hosts literary readings and other events, including the release of each of Erdrich's new works as well as the works and careers of other writers, particularly local Native writers. Erdrich and her staff consider Birchbark Books to be a <U+201C>teaching bookstore<U+201D>.<ref name="birchbarkbooks1">{{cite web|url=http://birchbarkbooks.com/OurStory |title=Our Story &#124; Birchbark Books & Native Arts &#124; Minneapolis, MN |publisher=Birchbarkbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref> In addition to books, the store sells Native art and traditional medicines, and Native American jewelry. A small nonprofit publisher founded by Erdrich and her sister, Wiigwaas Press, is affiliated with the store.<ref name="birchbarkbooks1"/>
