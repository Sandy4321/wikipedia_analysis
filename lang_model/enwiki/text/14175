'''Jean-Pierre Maradan''' (born 19 February 1954) is a former [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player who played as a [[Midfielder]] and [[Defender (football)|defender]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

Maradan was brought up in [[Deitingen]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Solothurn (canton)|Solothurn]] and started his football with the youth teams of the local football club. He transferred to [[FC Grenchen]] in 1970, played for their youth team Interregional and their first team [[Swiss Challenge League|Nationalliga B]]. The team won the [[Uhrencup]] 1971. They also won promotion to the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga A]] in 1971, but were relegated again at the end of the season [[1972<U+2013>73 in Swiss football|1972<U+2013>73]] .

In the summer of 1976 Maradan transferred to [[FC Basel]], with coach [[Helmut Benthaus]], back into the Nationalliga A. Despite the team already having a number of especially good players (Mundschin, Stohler, Geisser, [[Erni Maissen|Maissen]], [[Peter Ramseier|Ramseier]], [[Serge Muhmenthaler|Muhmenthaler]] and [[Paul Fischli|Fischli]]) the right footed Maradan quickly became a key player.<ref name="FCB">{{cite book | last = M<U+00FC>ller | first = Lukas | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2010 | url =  | title = Rotblau: Jean-Pierre Maradan <U+2013> Die Familie als R<U+00FC>ckhalt | format = | work = | publisher = FC Basel Marketing AG | ISSN = 1660-0878 }}</ref> With Basel he won the [[Swiss Super League|Swiss Championship]] twice and played in the [[Swiss Cup]] Final 1982, but they were defeated 1:0 by [[FC Sion]]. He was [[Coppa delle Alpi]] winner once and four times winner of the Uhrencup. In the Uhrencup Final 1983 he scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot.<ref name="rsssf">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2010 | url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/uhren.html#83| title = Coupe Horlog<U+00E8>re - Uhren Cup (Switzerland) | format = | work = | publisher = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation| accessdate = 2010-11-16}}</ref>

Following his successful time in Basel, Maradan returned to his family in [[Grenchen]].<ref name="FCB" /> He played for FC Grenchen for another two years before he retired. With the team he won the Uhrencup again in 1985.
