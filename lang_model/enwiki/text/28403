The '''Girl Scouts of the United States of America''' ('''GSUSA''') is a [[youth organization]] for girls in the United States and American girls living abroad. Founded by [[Juliette Gordon Low]] in 1912, it was organized after Low met [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], in 1911.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David C. |title=Mothers of Influence |publisher=Cook Communications Ministries |year=2005 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fsMhuXeEtH4C&dq |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |isbn=978-1-56292-368-6}}</ref> Upon returning to [[Savannah, Georgia]], she telephoned a distant cousin, saying, "I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the world, and we're going to start it tonight!"<ref name="JGL">Girl Scouts of the United States of America.

GSUSA aims to empower girls and to help teach values such as honesty, fairness, courage, compassion, character, sisterhood, confidence, and [[citizenship]] through activities including [[camping]], [[community service]], learning [[first aid]], and earning badges by acquiring practical skills. Girl Scouts' achievements are recognized through rank advancement and by various special awards such as the Girl Scout Bronze, Silver, and Gold Awards.

Membership is organized according to grade, with activities designed for each level. The GSUSA is a member of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS). It accepts girls from any background.

A 1994 ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' poll showed that the Girl Scouts was ranked by the public as the eighth "most popular charity/non-profit in America" of over 100 charities.<ref>"The Charities Americans Like Most And Least", ''The Chronicle of Philanthropy'', December 13, 1996</ref><ref>"Charity Begins With Health", ''USA Today'', December 20, 1994, p. 01D.</ref>{{Update inline|date=July 2013}} It describes itself as "the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls".<ref>{{cite web |title=About Girl Scouts of the USA |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |year=2008 |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/ |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Juliette Gordon Low dai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Juliette Gordon Low]] (center), with two Girl Scouts.]]
Girl Scouting in the United States of America began on March 12, 1912 when [[Juliette Gordon Low|Juliette "Daisy" Gordon Low]] organized the first Girl Scout troop meeting of 18 girls in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. It has since grown to 3.7 million members.<ref name="JGL"/> Low, who had met [[Baden-Powell]] in London while she was living in the United Kingdom, dreamed of giving the United States and the world "something for all the girls". She envisioned an organization that would bring girls out of their homes to serve their communities, experience the out-of-doors, and have the opportunity to develop "self-reliance and resourcefulness". From its inception, Girl Scouts has been organized and run exclusively by women, for girls and women.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aickin Rothschild |first=Mary |title=To Scout or to Guide?

The organization's original name was the Girl Guides of America. In 1913, it was changed to the Girl Scouts of the United States and the organization was incorporated in 1915.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The name was finally changed to the Girl Scouts of the United States of America in 1947. The organization was given a [[congressional charter]] on March 16, 1950.

The GSUSA started with 18 members. Within months, members were hiking through the woods in knee-length blue uniforms, playing basketball on a curtained-off court, and going on camping trips. In 1916, Low established an aviation badge<U+2014>even before women could vote. By 1920, there were nearly 70,000 members, and by 1930 over 200,000. In 2013 there were over 3.2&nbsp;million Girl Scouts: 2.3 million girl members and 890,000 adult members in the United States.<ref name="Who We Are">{{cite web |year=2013 |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/facts/ |title=Who We Are: Facts |publisher=Girl Scouts of The USA |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> More than 50&nbsp;million American women have participated in the Girl Scouts. Through its membership in the [[WAGGGS]], GSUSA girls and adults are among over 10 million members in 145 countries.<ref name="Who We Are"/>

The names and ages of the [[Girl Scout levels (USA)|levels]] and the larger structure of the program have evolved significantly. Troops were initially fairly independent before joining together into small councils, which have recently merged into larger councils. Today there are over 100 councils across the U.S.<ref name="Who We Are"/>

The [[Juliette Gordon Low Historic District#Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace|Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace]], located in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in the former Gordon family home, became the National Girl Scout program center in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/girlscout.pdf |format=PDF |title=Girl Scouting in Indiana |publisher=The Indiana Historian |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}</ref> It provides tours to thousands of Girl Scouts yearly. Upon Low's death in 1927, she willed her carriage house, which would eventually become The Girl Scout First Headquarters, to the local Savannah Girl Scouts for continued use.<ref name="troop1440history">{{cite web |last=Montgomery |first=Dana |year=2003 |url=http://cheesecakeandfriends.com/troop1440/history.htm |title=History of the Girl Scout Organization |publisher=Troop 1440, Wakefield, MA |accessdate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> The first National Headquarters was in [[Washington, D.C.]], but it was moved to [[New York City]] in the spring of 1916 and has remained there ever since.

The aim of the Girl Scouts is to help girls by pursuing four goals: developing their full potential; relating to others with increasing understanding, skill, and respect; developing a meaningful set of values to guide their actions and make sound decisions; and contributing to the improvement of society.<ref name="gsusaprogram">{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program |title=Girl Scout Program |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=September 29, 2006}}</ref>

===World War II===

During [[World War II]], 1943<U+2013>1945, many young Japanese-American girls were confined in [[Japanese American internment|internment]] camps with their families. Girl Scout troops were organized, even in these camps. These girls participated in many activities, including dramatic presentations that took place in the [[Crystal City Internment Camp]] in [[Crystal City, Texas]].

===Desegregation===
Most Girl Scout units were originally [[Racial segregation|segregated]] by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] according to state and local laws and customs. The first troop for African-American girls was founded in 1917; the first [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] troop was formed in [[New York State]] in 1921; and the first troop for [[Mexican Americans]] was formed in [[Houston]], Texas, in 1922. In 1933, Josephine Groves Holloway founded unofficial African-American troops in [[Tennessee]]. She also fully desegregated the Cumberland Valley council in 1962.<ref name="groves">{{cite book |others=Tennessee Historical Society, Nashville, Tenn. |author=Elisabeth Israels Perry|title=''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'' |origyear=1998 |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net |accessdate=September 8, 2006 |edition=Online |year=2002 |chapter=Josephine Groves Holloway |chapterurl=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=641}}</ref> The first official African-American troop in the South was founded in 1932 in [[Richmond, Virginia]] by Lena B.

By the 1950s, GSUSA had begun significant national efforts to desegregate the camps and maintain racial balance. One of the first desegregations, accomplished by Murray Walls in 1956, was Camp Shantituck in [[Kentucky]].<ref name="walls">{{cite book |title=Human Rights Report: New Great Black Kentuckian poster unveiled |url=http://www.state.ky.us/agencies2/kchr/pdf/Winter%20newsletter%202005.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 8, 2006 |year=2005 |month=Winter |publisher=Kentucky Commission on Human Rights |pages=3 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060923073929/http://www.state.ky.us/agencies2/kchr/pdf/Winter%20newsletter%202005.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Later the same year, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] described Girl Scouts as "a force for desegregation".<ref name="gordonlow">{{cite web |last=Montgomery |first=Dana |year=2006 |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/for_adults/leader_magazine/2006_spring/getting_to_know_jgl.asp |title=Getting to Know Juliette Gordon Low |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> In 1969, a national Girl Scout initiative called Action 70 was created that aimed to eliminate [[prejudice]].

===Wing Scouts===
{{main|Wing Scout}}
The '''Wing Scout''' program was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in flying and wanting to serve their country that started in 1941 and ended in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from 15 states met in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania to take Wing Scout leadership training. They returned to their councils and began setting up Wing Scout troops. In 1959, the Girl Scout Council in North [[San Mateo County]], California was presented with an offer from [[United Airlines]] San Francisco Management Club President J. L. Burnside to start an aviation program for Senior Girl Scouts. One of the highlights of the Wing Scout program was the courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines' jets. For many of the girls, this was the first time they had flown in a [[airplane|plane]]. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to take over the controls during flight in a small aircraft. The program was discontinued after [[United Airlines]] experienced financial setbacks in the 1970s.<ref name="wings1">{{cite book |title=Highlights in Girl Scout 1912-1996 |year=1996 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}} GSP154.2001</ref>

==Age levels==
{{main|Girl Scout levels (USA)}}

[[Image:Hillary Clinton girl scout.jpg|thumb|[[Hillary Clinton]] posing with Girl Scouts]]

The program was originally for girls aged 10 to 18, but it was subsequently divided into three levels. [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]] (for younger girls) was based on a program developed in England in 1914 and was officially recognized in the mid-1920s. At the same time, girls over 18, or over 16 if First Class Scouts, became known as Senior Scouts. In 1938, the age divisions were: Brownies (ages 7 through 9), Intermediates (ages 10 through 13), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18).<ref name="GSUSA Timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/1930s.asp |title=Timeline of GSUSA - 1930's |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=November 2, 2006}}</ref>

In 1965 the age structure was rearranged to Brownies (ages 7 through 9, later 6 through 9), Juniors (ages 9 through 11), Cadettes (ages 11 through 14), and Seniors (ages 14 through 17).<ref name="GSUSA Timeline1960s">{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/1970s.asp |title=Timeline of GSUSA 1970s |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=November 2, 2004}}</ref> In 1984, the [[Membership levels of the Girl Scouts of the USA#Girl Scout Daisies|Daisy]] program for [[kindergarten]] girls or those aged five was introduced.<ref name="GSUSA Timeline1970s">{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/1980s.asp |title=Timeline of GSUSA - 1980s |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=November 2, 2006}}</ref>

In 2003, the [[Studio 2B]] program for girls aged 11 to 17 was introduced through Cadettes and Seniors.<ref name="GSUSA TimelineToday">{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/today.asp |title=Timeline of GSUSA&nbsp;<U+2014> Today |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=November 2, 2006}}</ref> Studio 2B allowed girls to call themselves by any name of their choosing, including but not limited to "Studio 2Bs,"<ref>http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/studio2b/studio2b_quickreference.pdf</ref> "teen Girl Scouts," or Cadettes and Seniors. Girl Scouts, aged 11 through 17, can earn both traditional badges and undertake Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were rewritten to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in two ways: each booklet focused on topics such as environmentalism or self-confidence rather than being<!--being what?-->; and to earn each Studio 2B charm, the Girl Scout had to choose activities from the booklet and then meet a goal relevant to the booklet topic. She would create her own plan for achieving her goal, following a basic planning procedure called [[SMART (project management)|SMART]] (standing for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely).

On October 1, 2008, all levels were changed to have Girl Scouts as the beginning of their name, e.g. "Girl Scout Brownies" instead of "Brownie Girl Scouts", and all levels are by grade only instead of by age or grade. A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in [[Educational stages|Grades]] 11 and 12 (around 16 to 18 years old), with Girl Scout Seniors to be only in ninth and tenth grade (around 14 to 16 years old) and grades for other levels were changed. The new levels were tried in approximately six councils in Spring 2008, and began national use after October 1, 2008.

Although troop membership has always and is still the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not desire or have the time to participate in traditional troop activities can still sign up as individual Girl Scouts, known as a [[Juliettes (Girl Scouts)|Juliette]]. Juliettes attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards. The term Juliette may be phased out in the future.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[Campus Girl Scouts]] program allows women (ages 18 and older) to be active in Girl Scouting while in college. Campus Girl Scouting is an organization that helps promote and build student involvement in the community, the local council, and the college campus through service.<ref name="gsusacampus">{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/join/campus |title=Campus Girl Scouts |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=September 25, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060819145031/http://www.girlscouts.org/join/campus |archivedate=August 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>

===Mariner Scouts===
The 20th National Council of the GSUSA launched the Mariner Girl Scout program in October 1934.<ref name="vintagemariner">{{cite web |url=http://www.vintagegirlscout.com/unimariner.htm |title=Vintage Girl Scout Online Museum |work=Mariner Girl Scouts |publisher=Vintage Girl Scouts |accessdate=October 28, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071031234227/http://www.vintagegirlscout.com/unimariner.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=October 31, 2007}}</ref> Similar to the Boy Scouts' [[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouts]], the program was designed for older [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Scouts]] interested in outdoor water-based activities. By the end of 1934, 12 Mariner ships were registered and the first two handbooks, ''Launching a Girl Scout Mariner Ship'' and ''Charting the Course of a Girl Scout Mariner Ship'' were published. The Mariner Girl Scout program remains active but in a smaller form; most girls have instead joined the [[Sea Scouts]], which has been co-ed since 1971.<ref name="troop1440">{{cite web |url=http://cheesecakeandfriends.com/troop1440/history.htm |title=History of Girl Scouts |publisher=Troop 1440 |accessdate=October 28, 2007}}</ref>

===Special programs===
There are programs for girls in unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard program. The ''Girl Scouts Beyond Bars'' program helps daughters of incarcerated mothers to connect with their mothers and to have the mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, ''Girl Scouting in Detention Centers'', allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in Scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goddard |first=Jennifer |title=Where Girls Go, Girl Scouting Follows |publisher=Girl Scouts Cross Timbers Council |year=2003 |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/for_adults/leader_magazine/2003_spring/where_girls_go.asp |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref>

==Organizational structure==
The national organization has its central headquarters in New York City. With a staff of 400, it is headed by a Chief Executive Officer and a 40-member National Board of Directors. Girl Scouts of the USA celebrated 100 years of history and welcomed its new chief executive officer, Anna Maria Ch<U+00E1>vez, at its National Council Session/52nd Convention in Houston in November, 2011.<ref>http://blog.girlscouts.org/2011/11/anna-maria-chavez-speaks-to-girl-scouts.html</ref> The Chair of the National Board of Directors, the highest volunteer position, is Connie L. Lindsey.<ref>http://www.girlscouts.org/</ref>

Below the national organization are councils, which cover a large portion of a state or geographic region. Some councils own and run camps for the troops within its area of responsibility. Councils are usually subdivided into areas, called Neighborhoods, Service Units, or Associations (terms vary), which are program delivery areas that consist of troops at all age levels in a smaller area, such as a town.

The basic unit is the troop which may or may not be sponsored. In contrast to Boy Scout troop chartered organizations, Girl Scout troop sponsors do not own the troop. Troops range in size from as small as five to as large as 30 or more girls and may be divided into several patrols of 8 or fewer girls.

===Realignment===
In 2004, the Girl Scouts of the USA hired a consultant "to help Girl Scouts develop a strategy to ensure our future success and growth". They set targets and implemented ways to change the organization for the better. In addition, six "Gap Teams" looked at ways for Girl Scouting to improve its structure to prepare for future growth and success for the organization.<ref>{{cite web |title=Girl Scouts&nbsp;<U+2014> Core Business Strategy: Facts |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/strategy/facts.asp |accessdate=July 21, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> This was following declines in membership and in revenue, as well as challenges in subsidizing programs for inner city girls. The governance Gap Team found that consolidation decreased confusion and provided economies of scale, and recommended an optimal council size of approximately 10,000 girls.<ref name="lb7.uscourts.gov">http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/WIED/08-cv-00184op.pdf</ref> As of 2006, there were 312 regional Girl Scout councils, which own the 236,000 local troops and other groups.

As part of a 2006 reorganization, the National Board of Directors consolidated the 312 councils into 109 councils.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Girl Scouting Undergoes Historic Transformation to Focus on Leadership Development for 21st century Girls |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |date=September 18, 2006 |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/news/news_releases/2006/historic_transformation.asp |accessdate=September 26, 2006}}</ref>

This was not without resistance; the Manitou Girl Scout Council in [[Wisconsin]] sued the national GSUSA in Federal District Court alleging breach of the Girl Scout charter. Although the suit was summarily dismissed with prejudice by the district court,<ref name="lb7.uscourts.gov"/> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh U.S. Circuit of Appeals]] overturned that decision, stating that a Girl Scout council agreement "was no different than a [[Dunkin' Donuts]] franchise". The decision of the appeals court maintained the status of the Manitou Council. As a result, there are 112 Girl Scout councils in the United States.<ref>http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/122907563.html</ref>

;Promise

The Girl Scout Promise can be made in English, Spanish, or in [[American Sign Language]] with the same meaning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.girlscoutsmilehi.org/content/documents/GSPromiseLawLanguages.pdf |title=The Many Languages of the Girl Scout Promise and Law |accessdate=November 6, 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Girl Scouts&nbsp;<U+2014> Mile Hi Council }}</ref>

The Promise is often recited at Girl Scout troop meetings while holding up the [[Three-finger salute (scouts)|three middle fingers]] of the right hand, which forms the Girl Scout sign. Girl Scout policy states that the organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. The movement is nonsectarian, founded on American democratic principles,one of which is freedom of religion. In this context, the word "God" may be interpreted by each Girl Scout depending on her individual spiritual beliefs, and Girl Scouts are free to substitute the word consistent with her beliefs, such as "Creator", "my faith", "Allah", etc.<ref name="Nelson">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bill |title=What is the position of the GSUSA as related to God and religion? |publisher=[rec.scouting.issues] Commonly asked questions |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-25.html |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref>

===Girl Scout Uniforms===
For girls ages 5 to 14, the unifying look includes wearing a choice of a tunic, vest, sash for displaying official pins and awards, combined with their own solid white shirts and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scouts in high school can also wear a scarf that unites their look with the sisterhood of Girl Scouts around the world. For adult members the unifying look of the uniform is a Girl Scout official scarf or tie for men, worn with the official membership pins, combined with their own navy blue business attire. Girl Scouts at the Daisy and Brownie levels will continue to have a full uniform ensemble available.<ref>http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/insignia/where_to_place/ as of February 26, 2011</ref>

[[File:Girl Scout in uniform, 1973.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Girl Scout in uniform, 1973]]
Girl Scout uniforms have changed significantly over the years from the original navy blue in 1912, to khaki in 1914, to the familiar green. The evolution has included uniforms with the specificity to designate each age level of Girl Scouting. Since 2008, Girl Scouts at each level have one required element ([[Tunic]], [[Sash]] or Vest) for the display of official pins and awards which will be required when girls participate in ceremonies or officially represent the Girl Scout Movement.

For all levels, earned awards go on the front of the vest or sash following official placements. Fun patches can be displayed on the back of their vest or sash. Girl Scout Daisies can chose a blue vest or a smock with a full uniform or white shirt and khaki pants and skirt. They have their own Daisy Pin and a choice of accessories. Girl Scout Brownies can chose a traditional brown vest or sash to be worn with the historic Brownie Pin and other uniform pieces or white shirt and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scout Juniors wear their official vest or sash to display insignia including awards, coupled with a white shirt and khaki pants or skirt. Girl Scout Cadettes, Seniors and Ambassadors can chose a khaki sash or vest to go with khaki pants or skirt and a white shirt.

The adult uniform also changed, with registered women and men wearing navy blue business attire, again from their regular wardrobes. Also available for women are official sweaters and an insignia scarf, while men have the option of an official tie.<ref>http://www.girlscoutshop.com/gsusaonline/LandingPage.aspx?subCatId=Uniform-Women&menuItemId=Uniform.5</ref><ref>http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/insignia/where_to_place/</ref>

===Logos===
[[File:Girl Scouts of the USA 1912-1976.svg|thumb|left|Designed by [[Juliette Low]], the sole emblem of the Girl Scouts of the USA from 1912 until 1976]]
The current Girl Scouts of the USA logo was adopted in 2010, based on [[Saul Bass]]'s 1978 logo. Bass was a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences, most notably for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. The hair and facial styles were updated by Jennifer Kinon and Bobby Martin of The Original Champions of Design.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Alissa |title=A Fresh Identity for the Girl Scouts of America |work=Co Design |publisher=Fast Company |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1661850/a-fresh-identity-for-the-girl-scouts-of-america |date=July 6, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref>

The emblem designed by [[Juliette Low]] was the only emblem used for Girl Scout Pins through 1980. The 1978 GSUSA National Convention voted to use two logos, and allow Girl Scouts to pick which they wanted to wear as their Girl Scout Pin (for Girl Scout Juniors and up).

==Activities==
One of the original and continuing attractions of Girl Scouts is that girls become proficient campers and participate in many outdoor activities such as [[canoe]]ing or [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] with their troops. Troops do service projects such as carrying out flag ceremonies, collecting food for food drives, visiting nursing homes and Christmas caroling or other community services.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Girl Scouting? |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA, Talus Rock Council |url=http://www.talusrockpa.org/Girls/girlscouting.asp |accessdate=November 1, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050908113945/http://talusrockpa.org/Girls/girlscouting.asp |archivedate=September 8, 2005}}</ref> Troops may also plan and take extended trips such as visiting another part of the United States or even travel to another country. Troops may organize [[culture|cultural]] or learning events such as first aid training or attending live theatre. The Girl Scout activity most familiar to the general public may be the annual sale of [[Girl Scout Cookies]], which started in 1917 as a money-earning opportunity for the local council and troops.

===Destinations===
{{main|Destinations}}
Once known as "Wider Opportunities" or [[Wider Ops]], [[Destinations]] are travel opportunities for individual older Girl Scouts. Destinations are held within the United States and in other countries. Destinations are primarily international, outdoor, science, people, or apprenticeship oriented.,<ref name=toolkit>{{Cite web | title=GSUSA Global Toolkit "Your Passport to Travel" | url=http://www.girlscouts.org/forgirls/travel//global_travel_toolkit/pdf/destinations_brochure_lores.pdf | publisher=GSUSA | accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> such as [[kayaking]] in Alaska, or career oriented such as learning about working for [[NASA]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Destinations 411 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |url=http://www.studio2b.org/escape/destinations/destinations_411.asp |accessdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>

A "Destination" may be a trip to one of the WAGGGS World Centres:
* [[Our Caba<U+00F1>a]] in [[Cuernavaca, Mexico]]
* [[Our Chalet]] in [[Adelboden, Switzerland]]
* [[Pax Lodge]] in London, England
* [[Sangam World Centre]] in [[Pune, India]]<ref>http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/global/wagggs/world_centers.asp</ref>

==Traditions==
The Girl Scouts of the USA have many customs and traditions: camping, community service, singing, and money earning to support their activities. The Girl Scout Handshake and the Girl Scout signal for silence are two shared by WAGGGS member organizations. Other traditions include the Friendship Circle with "the squeeze," taking bandanas and homemade sit-upons on camping trips, and the buddy system.

"Bridging" is the process of going from one level to another. Bridging is usually done at the troop level, although area bridgings are often held. The girls that are bridging walk across a bridge to their new level and are greeted with the Girl Scout Handshake. There is a notable bridging ceremony held in San Francisco, as GS Juniors bridge to GS Cadettes over the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].

[[World Thinking Day]] and "Girl Scouts' Own" are traditions throughout the world of Girl Scouting. World Thinking Day has occurred annually since 1926 on February 22, the birthday of both [[Robert Baden-Powell]] and [[Olave Baden-Powell]]. On World Thinking Day, Girl Scouts and Guides around the world think about their sisters in other lands;<ref name="thinkday">{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/global/world_thinking_day/world_thinking_day_2005.asp |title=World Thinking Day |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref> Councils or local service units (associations) hold a celebration on or near this day, in which each participating troop gives a presentation of the culture and customs of a country selected by the troop. Many Girl Scouts in America celebrate Juliette Gordon Low's birthday on October 31, Founder's Day. The parties often include the girls dressing up in Halloween costumes, and serving birthday cake.

A "Girl Scouts' Own" is a special ceremony that expresses the spirit of Girl Scouting when the girls reflect upon their feelings about Girl Scouting and the world around them. A "Girl Scouts' Own" can have any theme, or none at all. It is a solemn time given for Girl Scouts to create a moment of their very own. It can be held at any time and include the girls' troop or be held at any inter-troop gathering.<ref name="ceremony">http://www.scoutingweb.com/scoutingweb/SubPages/CeremoniesCelebrationsGS.htm</ref>

==Awards and badges==
[[Image:Girl Scout working on her Gold Award Project.jpg|thumb|A Girl Scout working on her Gold Award project.]]
Members can earn awards appropriate for their age level. Originally called badges, the terminology has changed to Learning Petals for GS Daisies, GS Try-Its for Brownies, GS Badges for Juniors, and Charms and Interest Project awards for GS Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors (older girls). These Girl Scout awards are expected to be renamed "badges" in 2012<U+2013>2014. Girl Scout Daisies will still earn Learning Petals and will be able to earn "Leaves".<ref>''Girls' Gide to Girl Scouting'', handbook replacement out in August 2011</ref> Girl Scouts at every level can also earn Journey Awards. Journeys have become a large part of the Girl Scout program. In 2011, there were three Journeys, with books and awards for each level: "It's Your World<U+2014>Change It!", "It's Your Planet<U+2014>Love It!", and "It's Your Story<U+2014>Tell It!".

The highest achievement in Girl Scouting is the [[Gold Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Girl Scout Gold Award]], which can only be earned by GS Seniors and Ambassadors. The highest award for GS Cadettes is the [[Silver Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Silver Award]] and [[Bronze Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Bronze Award]] is the highest award for Girl Scout Juniors. These awards require large-scale service projects showing leadership along with service hours.<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Insignia |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/insignia/list/11_17.asp |accessdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref> The service projects must improve a current situation, such as restoring the eroded banks of a stream. These are the equivalent to the Eagle Scout honor among the Boy Scouts although it does not gain the same sort of recognition.

Girl Scouts can also earn and display on their uniform awards from outside organizations, such as the [[Religious Emblems Programs|religious emblems]] from religious organizations, or the [[President's Volunteer Service Award]]. Girl Scouts can also receive awards for lifesaving and leadership.

===Adult recognition===
There are also GS awards for adults including: Outstanding Volunteer, Outstanding Leader, Appreciation Pin, Honor Pin, Thanks Badge, and Thanks Badge II. Outstanding Volunteer is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout volunteer (other than a leader). Outstanding Leader is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout leader. Appreciation Pin is awarded for exceptional performance beyond expectations for the position. The Honor Pin recognizes an adult member who has delivered exceptional service beyond expectations to two or more geographic areas, service units or program delivery audiences in a way that furthers the council's goals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Honor Pin Criteria |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA, Tongass Alaska Girl Scout Council |url=http://www.tongassgirlscouts.org/Forms/Honor%20Pin%20Award%20Nomination%20Form.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=November 2, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060811170049/http://www.tongassgirlscouts.org/Forms/Honor+Pin+Award+Nomination+Form.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2006}}</ref> Thanks Badge recognizes outstanding service for two or more "service units". Different GS councils use different terminology for regions within their council. Thanks Badge II is awarded where the recipient has received the Thanks Badge and the recipient<U+2019>s service continues to merit further recognition. At least one nomination, two endorsements, and a review of the forms is required for each of these awards.<ref>{{cite web |title=GSUSA Awards |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA, Girl Scouts of Northern New Jersey |url=http://www.gsnnj.org/adult_recognition2011.html |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101223000047/http://gsnnj.org/adult_recognition2011.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=December 23, 2010 }}</ref>

==Effect on American life==
Among the many famous American Girl Scouts are [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Katie Couric]], and [[Elizabeth Dole]].<ref name="famous">{{cite web |title=Famous Girl Scouts |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |year=2003 |url=http://www.girlscoutsctc.com/famousgs.html |accessdate=November 5, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060207165421/http://www.girlscoutsctc.com/famousgs.html |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Many Girl Scouts have become successful leaders in numerous professional fields such as law, medicine, politics, journalism, and science.<ref name="famous" /> Beginning with [[Lou Henry Hoover]], the incumbent [[First Lady]] has served as the Honorary President of GSUSA.

Over twenty of NASA<U+2019>s career astronauts were former Girl Scouts. The first American woman to spacewalk was a former Girl Scout, Dr. Kathryn Sullivan.<ref>http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/girlscouts/gsusa_astro.html as of February 26, 2011</ref>

===The American Girl===
From 1917 until 1979 Girl Scouts published a magazine, originally called ''The Rally'' (1917<U+2013>1920) and then ''The American Girl'', with the 'The' later being dropped (not to be confused with the currently published ''[[American Girl (magazine)|American Girl]]'' magazine).<ref>{{cite web |title=Girl Scouting in Indiana&nbsp;<U+2014> Timeline |publisher=Indiana Historical Bureau |url=http://www.in.gov/history/2538.htm |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}</ref> At one time this magazine had the largest circulation of any magazine aimed at teen-aged girls.{{when|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Issues==
===No official stand on sexuality and gender issues===
Girl Scouts of the USA stated in an October 1991 letter:<ref>{{cite web |title=GSUSA Statement |publisher=BSA Discrimination.org |month=October |year=1991 |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa.html#statement |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref>

The Girl Scout organization does not condone or permit sexual displays of any sort by its members during Girl Scout activities, nor does it permit the advocacy or promotion of a personal lifestyle or sexual preference. These are private matters for girls and their families to address.}}
GSUSA upholds a "don't ask, don't evangelize" policy on sexuality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Girl Scouts and Discrimination |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa.html#statement |publisher=BSA-Discrimination |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}</ref> The debate over this issue is split between those who feel that the policy should avoid and prevent discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], and those who question the inclusion of lesbians.<ref>{{cite web |title=People for the American Way: Family Research Council |url=http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=4211 |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=25503 |title=First-person: Not Your Mom's Girl Scouts |first=Penna |last=Dexter |publisher=Baptist Press |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |date=April 26, 2007}}</ref>

In October 2011, the [[Girl Scouts of Colorado]] council publicly stated, "If a child identifies as a girl and the child's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout," when overturning a local troop's rejection of a 7-year-old transgender girl.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/transgender-boy-allowed-to-join-girl-scouts/story-e6freuyi-1226180155319 |title=Transgender boy allowed to join Girl Scouts |publisher=the telegraph |accessdate=October 29, 2011 |date=October 29, 2011}}</ref>

In January 2012, a teen in California created a video calling for the boycott of Girl Scout Cookies due to a troop in Colorado accepting in a transgender child.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teen-calls-boycott-girl-scout-cookies-transgender-members-article-1.1005123</ref>

The Girl Scouts themselves defended their actions against this. "For 100 years, Girl Scouts has prided itself on being an inclusive organization serving girls from all walks of life. We handle cases involving transgender children on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on ensuring the welfare and best interests of the child in question and the other girls in the troop as our highest priority."

==="To Serve God" in the Promise===
In early 1992, the Totem Girl Scout Council suggested changing the promise to make it possible for girls who did not believe in a [[monotheistic]] god to join. In November 1992, the parents of Nitzya Cuevas-Macias sued for their daughter to be permitted to participate even though she refused to promise to serve God.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Pat |title=OC lawyer moves battle over oath to Girl Scouts&nbsp;<U+2014> Man who won suit for sons now backing Daisy hopeful |publisher=BSA Discrimination.org |date=November 19, 1992 |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html |accessdate=October 20, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Pat |title=Girl Scout troop ordered to readmit atheist |publisher=BSA Discrimination.org |date=December 20, 1992 |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html#921222 |accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref>

{{bquote|THAT, since the Girl Scout organization makes no attempt to interpret
or define the word 'God' but encourages members to establish for
themselves the nature of their spiritual beliefs, it is the policy of
the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. that individuals when making the Girl
Scout Promise may substitute wording appropriate to their own
spiritual beliefs for the word 'God'.}}
with the explanation that
{{bquote|For some individuals, the word 'God', no matter how broadly
interpreted, does not appropriately reflect their spiritual beliefs.
Since the belief in a spiritual principle is fundamental to Girl
Scouting, not the word used to define that belief, it is important
that individuals have the opportunity to express that belief in
wording meaningful to them.

It is essential to maintain the spiritual foundation of Girl Scouting,
yet be inclusive of the full range of spiritual beliefs. This [policy
change] does not take the word 'God' out of the Girl Scout Promise.
It gives those individuals who wish to do so the option to state their
commitment to the spiritual concepts fundamental to the Movement with
a word or words more appropriate to their own beliefs. For instance,
an individual may say 'my faith' or 'Allah' or 'the Creator'."}}

Girl Scout President B. LaRae Orullian made an official statement that the change is "a very strong statement that Girl Scouts continue to be on the cutting edge, and this is a continuing effort to show that we have strength in diversity and that we are an inclusive organization."<ref name="vote"/>

Some groups consider that the Girl Scouts of the USA have not gone far enough in making Scouting open to [[non-theists]]; others that they have gone too far in removing God or that they are violating the constitution of the [[WAGGGS]]. The WAGGGS constitution requires member societies to maintain membership standards to include a promise similar to the one established by Baden-Powell, which includes the concept of duty to God.<ref>{{cite web |title=WAGGGS constitution |publisher=WAGGGS |url=http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/5/1/constitution-English.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Exploring Spirituality in Girl Guides and Girl Scouts: Module 1 |publisher=WAGGGS |url=http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/16/2/1module1-ExploringSpiritualityinGirlGuiding-GirlScouting.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Exploring Spirituality: Resource Materials for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts |publisher=WAGGGS |year=2000 |url=http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/16/1/1ExpSpirIntroduction.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref> The GSUSA policy adopted in 1993 led to the 1995 formation of an alternative organization, the [[American Heritage Girls]] that accepts only leaders and chartering organizations that agree with a specific Christian statement of faith.<ref name="The History of The American Heritage Girls">{{cite web |url=http://www.ahgonline.org/pages/page.asp?page_id=20600 |title=Why AHG? |publisher=American Heritage Girls |accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref> The organization had a little over 5,000 members in 2006.

{{bquote|The Girl Scout organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. Our movement is secular and is founded on American democratic principles, one of which is freedom of religion.

The decision to say a grace, blessing, or invocation is made locally at the troop or group level, and should be sensitive to the spiritual beliefs of all participants.}}

===Local objections to sex education sponsored by Planned Parenthood in Waco, Texas===
GSUSA is not aligned with and does not endorse, at the national level, the reproductive health organization [[Planned Parenthood]]; Girl Scout councils may choose to have or not have connections with Planned Parenthood.<ref>{{cite web | last =Kleder | first = Martha| title = Girl Scouts<U+2019> Stumble Boosts Christian-Based American Heritage Girls | date = March 30, 2004 | url = http://www.cwfa.org/articles/5431/CWA/misc/index.htm| accessdate =November 4, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061103005050/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/5431/CWA/misc/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = November 3, 2006}}</ref> In 2004, in [[Waco, Texas]], the local Bluebonnet Council promoted a Planned Parenthood education event without providing money nor sending Girl Scouts to it.
