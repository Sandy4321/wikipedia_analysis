'''Adam Bernard Mickiewicz''' ({{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Adam_Mickiewicz.ogg|m|i|c|'|k|J|e|w|i|cz}}; 24 December 1798{{spaced ndash}}26 November 1855) was a [[Polish people|Polish]]<ref name="Drabble"/><ref name="Adam Mickiewicz"/> [[List of national poets#Europe|national poet]], dramatist, essayist, publicist, translator, professor of Slavic literature, and political activist. A principal figure in [[romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]], he is counted  one of Poland's "[[Three Bards]]" ("''Trzej Wieszcze''") and is widely regarded as Poland's greatest poet.<ref name="mickiewicz"/><ref name="mickiewicz1"/><ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2010"/> He is also considered one of the greatest [[Slavic language|Slavic]]<ref name="PomorskaBaran1992"/> and [[Europea]]n<ref name="budowniczowie"/> poets and has been dubbed a "Slavic bard".<ref name="fra"/> A leading Romantic dramatist,<ref name="tm"/> he has been compared in Poland and Europe to [[George Gordon Byron|Byron]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].<ref name=fra/><ref name=tm/>

He is known chiefly for the poetic drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (''Forefathers' Eve'') and the [[Epic poetry|national epic poem]] ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''. His other influential works include ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' and ''[[Gra<U+017C>yna (poem)|Gra<U+017C>yna]]''. All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the [[Partitions of Poland|three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence]].

Mickiewicz was born in the [[Russian partition|Russian-partitioned]] territories of the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which had been part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region.  After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of [[Great Emigration|his compatriots]], lived out the rest of his life abroad.  He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on [[Slavs|Slavic]] literature at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]].  He died, probably of [[cholera]], at [[Istanbul]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], where he had gone to help organize Polish and Jewish forces to fight Russia in the [[Crimean War]]. 

In 1890 his remains were repatriated from [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]], in France, to [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], Poland.

===Early years===

[[File:Dom A.Mickiewicza w Nowogr<U+00F3>dku.jpg|thumb|left|Mickiewicz's house, [[Navahrudak]]]]

Adam Mickiewicz was born 24 December 1798, either at his paternal uncle's estate in [[Zavosse|Zaosie]] (now Zavosse) near [[Navahrudak]] (in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Nowogr<U+00F3>dek'') or in Navahrudak itself{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} in what was then part of the [[Russian Empire]] and is now [[Belarus]]. The region was on the periphery of [[Lithuania proper]] and had been part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] until the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1795).<ref name=venc/><ref name="Yad Vashem Studies"/> The area had earlier been inhabited by ethnic [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]],<ref name="cze208"/> but by the time of his birth it was largely [[Belarusians|Belarusian]]-populated.<ref name="cze208"/> Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either [[Polish people|Polish]] or [[polonization|Polonized]].<ref name=venc/> The poet's father, Miko<U+0142>aj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish<ref name="vytautas"/> [[szlachta|nobility]] (''szlachta'')<ref name="cze208"/> and bore the hereditary [[Poraj coat of arms|Poraj coat-of-arms]];<ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/> Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Majewska.<ref name="psb694"/> Adam was the second-born son in the family.<ref name="psb694"/>

Mickiewicz spent his childhood in Navahrudak<ref name="cze208"/><ref name="psb694"/>, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] school following a curriculum that had been designed by the now-defunct Polish [[Commission for National Education]], which had been the world's first [[ministry of education]].<ref name="cze208"/><ref name="psb694"/><ref name="Wulff1992"/> He was a mediocre student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.<ref name="cze208"/>

In September 1815, Mickiewicz enrolled at the [[Vilnius University|Imperial University of Vilnius]] (in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Wilno''),<ref name="psb694"/> studying to be a teacher. After graduating, under the terms of his government scholarship, he taught secondary school at [[Kaunas]] from 1819 to 1823.<ref name="psb694"/>

In 1818, in the Polish-language ''{{Ill|pl|Tygodnik Wile<U+0144>ski}}'' (Wilno Weekly), he published his first poem, "''Zima miejska''" ("City Winter").<ref name="psb695"/> The next few years would see a maturing of his style from [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]]/[[neoclassicism]] to [[romanticism]], first in his poetry anthologies published in [[Vilnius]] in 1822 and 1823; these anthologies included the poem "''[[Gra<U+017C>yna (poem)|Gra<U+017C>yna]]''" and the first-published parts (II and IV) of his major work, ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (''Forefathers' Eve'').<ref name="psb695"/> By 1820 he had already finished another major romantic poem, "''[[Oda do m<U+0142>odo<U+015B>ci]]''" ("Ode to Youth"), but it was considered to be too patriotic and revolutionary for publication and would not appear officially for many years.<ref name="psb695"/>

About the summer of 1820, Mickiewicz met the love of his life, {{Ill|pl|Maryla Wereszczak<U+00F3>wna}}. They were unable to marry due to his family's poverty and relatively low social status; in addition, she was already engaged to Count {{Ill|pl|Wawrzyniec Puttkamer}}, whom she would marry in 1821.<ref name="psb695"/><ref name="cze210"/>
===Imprisonment and exile===
[[File:Zinaida Volkonskaya's salon.jpeg|thumb|250px|Princess [[Zinaida Volkonskaya]]'s [[Moscow]] [[salon (gathering)|salon]], frequented by Mickiewicz]]
In 1817, while still a student, Mickiewicz, [[Tomasz Zan]] and other friends had created a secret organization, the [[Philomaths]].<ref name="psb695"/> The group focused on self-education but had ties to a more radical, clearly pro-Polish-independence student group, the [[Filaret Association]].<ref name="psb695"/> An investigation of secret student organizations by [[Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev]], begun in early 1823, led to the arrests of a number of students and ex-student activists including Mickiewicz, who was taken into custody and imprisoned at Vilnius' Basilian monastery in late 1823 or early 1824 (sources disagree as to the date).<ref name="psb695"/>  After investigation into his political activities, specifically his membership in the [[Philomaths]], in 1824 Mickiewicz was banished to central Russia.<ref name="psb695"/>  Within a few hours of  receiving the decree on 22 October 1824, he penned a poem into an album belonging to Salomea B<U+00E9>cu, the mother of [[Juliusz S<U+0142>owacki]].<ref name="mickiewitch"/>  (In 1975 this poem was set to music in Polish and Russian by Soviet composer [[David Tukhmanov]].)<ref name="popsa"/>  Mickiewicz crossed the border into Russia about 11 November 1824, arriving in [[Saint Petersburg]] later that month.<ref name="psb695"/> He would spend most of the next five years in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, except for a notable 1825 excursion to [[Odessa]] in [[Crimea]].<ref name="cze218"/> That visit, from February to November 1825, inspired a notable collection of [[sonnet]]s (some love sonnets, and a series known as ''{{Ill|pl|Crimean Sonnets|Sonety krymskie}}'', published a year later.<ref name="psb695"/><ref name="cze218"/><ref name="psb696"/>

Mickiewicz was welcomed into the leading literary circles of [[Saint Petersburg]] and Moscow, where he became a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation.<ref name="psb696"/> The year 1828 saw the publication of his poem ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]''.<ref name="psb696"/> Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.<ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/><ref name="psb696"/>

In Moscow, Mickiewicz met the Polish journalist and novelist [[Henryk Rzewuski]] and the Polish composer and piano virtuoso [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]], whose daughter, [[Celina Szymanowska]], Mickiewicz would later marry in Paris, France. He also befriended the great Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]]<ref name="psb696"/> and [[Decembrist]] leaders including [[Kondraty Ryleyev]].<ref name="cze218"/> It was thanks to his friendships with many influential individuals that he was eventually able to obtain a passport and permission to leave Russia for Western Europe.<ref name="psb696"/>

===European travels===
[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Walenty Wa<U+0144>kowicz]], 1828]]
After serving five years of exile to Russia, Mickiewicz received permission to go abroad in 1829. On 1 June that year, he arrived in [[Weimar]].<ref name="psb696"/> By 6 June he was in [[Berlin]], where he attended lectures by the philosopher [[G.W.F. Hegel|Hegel]].<ref name="psb696"/> In February 1830 he visited [[Prague]], later returning to [[Weimar]], where he received a cordial reception from the writer, scientist and politician [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].<ref name="psb696"/>

He then continued on through Germany all the way to Italy, which he entered via the [[Alps]]' [[Spl<U+00FC>gen Pass]].<ref name="psb696"/> Accompanied by an old friend, the poet [[Antoni Edward Odyniec]], he visited [[Milan]], Venice, [[Florence]] and Rome.<ref name="psb696"/><ref name="psb697"/> In August that same year (1830) he went to [[Geneva]], where he met fellow [[Three Bards|Polish Bard]] [[Zygmunt Krasi<U+0144>ski]].<ref name="psb697"/> During these travels he had a brief romance with {{Ill|pl|Henrietta Ewa Ankwicz<U+00F3>wna}}, but class differences again prevented his marrying his new love.<ref name="psb697"/>

Finally about October 1830 he took up residence in Rome, which he declared "the most amiable of foreign cities."<ref name="psb697"/> Soon after, he learned about the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] in Poland, but he would not leave Rome until the spring of 1831.<ref name="psb697"/>

On 19 April 1831 Mickiewicz departed Rome, traveling to Geneva and Paris and later, on a false passport, to Germany, via [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]] arriving about 13 August in [[Pozna<U+0144>]] (in [[German language|German]], ''Posen'') in German Poland.<ref name="psb697"/> It is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the Italian [[Carbonari]] to the French underground, and delivered documents or money for the Polish insurgents from the Polish community in Paris, but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce.<ref name="psb697"/><ref name="cze222"/> Ultimately he never crossed into [[Russian Poland]], where the Uprising was mainly happening; he stayed in [[German Poland]] (historically known to Poles as "[[Greater Poland]]"), well received at many estates of local Polish nobility.<ref name="psb697"/> He had a brief liaison with {{Ill|pl|Konstancja <U+0141>ubie<U+0144>ska}} at her family estate.<ref name="psb697"/> Starting in March 1832, Mickiewicz stayed several months in [[Dresden]], in [[Saxony]],<ref name="psb697"/><ref name="psb698"/> where he wrote the third part of his poem ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]''.<ref name="psb698"/>

===Paris <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>===
[[File:David d'Angers - Adam Mickiewicz.jpg|thumb|left|Mickiewicz, 1835]]
On 31 July 1832 he arrived in Paris, accompanied by a close friend and fellow ex-[[Philomaths|Philomath]], the future geologist and [[Chile]]an educator [[Ignacy Domeyko]].<ref name="psb698"/> In Paris, Mickiewicz became active in [[Great Emigration|many Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> groups]] and published articles in ''{{Ill|pl|Pielgrzym Polski}}'' (The Polish Pilgrim).<ref name="psb698"/> The fall of 1832 saw the publication, in Paris, of the third part of his ''Dziady'' (smuggled into partitioned Poland), as well as of ''{{Ill|pl|The Books of the Polish People and of the Polish Pilgrimage|Ksi<U+0119>gi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego}}'', which Mickiewicz self-published.<ref name="psb698"/> In 1834 he published another masterpiece, his [[epic poem]] ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.<ref name="psb699"/>

''Pan Tadeusz'', his longest poetic work, marked the end of his most productive literary period.<ref name="psb699"/><ref name="cze227"/> Mickiewicz would create further notable works, such as ''{{Ill|pl|Lausanne Lyrics|Liryki loza<U+0144>skie}}'', 1839<U+2013>40) and ''Zdania i uwagi'' (Thoughts and Remarks, 1834<U+2013>40), but neither would achieve the fame of his earlier works.<ref name="psb699"/> His relative literary silence, beginning in the mid-1830s, has been variously interpreted:  he may have lost his talent; he may have chosen to focus on teaching and on political writing and organizing.<ref name="cze229"/>

On 22 July 1834, in Paris, he married [[Celina Szymanowska]], daughter of composer and concert pianist [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]].<ref name="psb699"/> They would have six children (two daughters, Maria and Helena; and four sons, W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw, Aleksander, Jan and J<U+00F3>zef).<ref name="psb699"/> Celina later became mentally ill, possibly with a [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="psb699"/> In December 1838, marital problems caused Mickiewicz to attempt suicide.<ref name="Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107>">{{cite book|title=Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107>|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SONKAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2013|year=1998|publisher=RSW "Prasa-Ksi<U+0105><U+017C>a-Ruch"|page=80}}</ref> Celina would die on 5 March 1855.<ref name="psb699"/>

Mickiewicz and his family lived in relative poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work <U+2013> not a very profitable endeavor.<ref name="psb700"/> They received support from friends and patrons, but not enough to substantially change their situation.<ref name="psb700"/> Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government.<ref name="psb700"/> By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> political scene.<ref name="psb699"/>
[[File:Adam Mickiewicz by Jan Mieczkowski.jpg|thumb|150px|Mickiewicz]]
In 1838 Mickiewicz became professor of [[Latin literature]] at the [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne Academy]], in Switzerland.<ref name="psb700"/> Despite his having no prior experience as a teacher, his lectures were well received.<ref name="psb700"/> In 1840 he was appointed to the newly-established chair of [[Slavic languages]] and literatures at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]].<ref name="psb700"/><ref name="cze230"/> Leaving Lausanne, he was made an honorary [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne Academy]] professor.<ref name="psb700"/>

He would, however, hold the Coll<U+00E8>ge de France post for little more than three years, his last lecture being delivered on 28 May 1844.<ref name="psb700"/> His lectures were popular, drawing many listeners in addition to enrolled students, and receiving reviews in the press.<ref name="psb700"/> Some would be remembered much later; his sixteenth lecture, on [[Slavic theater]], "was to become a kind of gospel for Polish theater directors of the twentieth century."<ref name="cze223"/>

But he became increasingly possessed by religious [[mysticism]] as he fell under the influence of the Polish philosopher [[Andrzej Towia<U+0144>ski]], whom he met in 1841.<ref name="psb700"/><ref name="psb701"/> His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government.<ref name="psb700"/><ref name="psb701"/> The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towia<U+0144>ski regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.<ref name="psb701"/><ref name="Alvis2005"/>

In 1846 Mickiewicz severed his ties with Towia<U+0144>ski, following the rise of revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in events such as the [[Krak<U+00F3>w Uprising]] of February 1846.<ref name="psb702"/> Mickiewicz criticized Towia<U+0144>ski's passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church.<ref name="psb702"/> In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate [[Margaret Fuller]].<ref name="psb703"/> In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by [[Pope Pius IX]], whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the [[French Revolution of 1848]].<ref name="psb702"/> Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the [[Mickiewicz Legion]], to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands.<ref name="cze230"/><ref name="psb702"/> The unit never became large enough to be more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.<ref name="psb703"/>

In December 1848 he was offered a post at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Austrian-ruled [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], but the offer was soon withdrawn after pressure from Austrian authorities.<ref name="psb703"/> In the winter of 1848<U+2013>49, Polish composer [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]], in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot and soothed the poet's nerves with his piano music.<ref name="jachimecki"/> Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz's poems to music (see [[Polish songs by Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]]).<ref name="jachimecki2"/>

===Final years===

[[File:<U+0130>stanbul 6137.jpg|thumb|Mickiewicz's temporary grave under his [[Istanbul]] apartment, now an [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul|Adam Mickiewicz Museum]]]]
In the winter of 1849, Mickiewicz founded a French-language newspaper, ''[[La Tribune des Peuples]]'' (''The Peoples' Tribune''), supported by a wealthy Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> activist, {{Ill|pl|Ksawery Branicki (d. 1879){{!}}Ksawery Branicki|Ksawery Branicki (z Montr<U+00E9>sor)}}.<ref name="psb703"/> Mickiewicz wrote over 70 articles for the ''Tribune'' during its short existence:  it came out between 15 March and 10 November 1849, when it was shut down by the authorities.<ref name="psb703"/><ref name="cze231"/>  His articles supported democracy and socialism and many ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and the Napoleonic era, though he held few illusions regarding the idealism of the [[House of Bonaparte]].<ref name="psb703"/> He supported the restoration of the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] in 1851.<ref name="psb703"/> In April 1852 he lost his post at the Coll<U+00E8>ge de France, which he had been allowed to keep (though without the right to lecture).<ref name="psb700"/><ref name="psb703"/> On 31 October 1852 he was hired as a librarian at the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que de l'Arsenal]].<ref name="psb703"/><ref name="cze231"/> There he was visited by another Polish poet, [[Cyprian Norwid]], who wrote of the meeting in his poem, "''Czarne kwiaty''" ("Black Blossoms"); and there Mickiewicz's wife Celina died.<ref name="psb703"/>

Mickiewicz welcomed the [[Crimean War]], which he hoped would lead to a new European order including a restored independent Poland.<ref name="psb703"/> His last composition was a [[Latin language|Latin]] [[ode]] ''Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum'', in honor of [[Napoleon III]], celebrating the British-French victory at the [[Battle of Bomarsund]].<ref name="psb703"/> [[H<U+00F4>tel Lambert#The political salon|Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>s associated with the H<U+00F4>tel Lambert]] persuaded him to became active again in politics.<ref name="psb703"/><ref name="psb704"/> Soon after the outbreak of the Crimean War, he was given a diplomatic mission by the French government.<ref name="psb704"/> He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in [[Istanbul]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]], on 22 September.<ref name="psb704"/> There, working with [[Micha<U+0142> Czajkowski]] (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to be used under Ottoman command against Russia.<ref name="cze231"/><ref name="psb704"/> With his friend [[Armand Levy]], he also set about organizing a Jewish legion.<ref name="cze231"/><ref name="psb704"/> He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yeni<U+015F>ehir Street in the [[Beyo<U+011F>lu|Pera]] (now Beyo<U+011F>lu) district of Istanbul and died on 26 November 1855.<ref name="psb704"/><ref name="rzeczypospolitej"/> Though [[Tadeusz Boy-<U+017B>ele<U+0144>ski]] and others have speculated that Mickiewicz might have been poisoned by political enemies, there is no proof of this, and he probably contracted [[cholera]], which claimed other lives there at the time.<ref name="cze231"/><ref name="psb704"/><ref name="Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760-1850, Volume 2"/>

Mickiewicz's remains were transported to France, boarding ship on 31 December 1855, and were buried at [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]] on 21 January 1861.<ref name="psb704"/> In 1890 they were disinterred, moved to Poland, and on 4 July entombed in the crypts of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], place of final repose for a number of persons important to Poland's political and cultural history.<ref name="psb704"/>

Mickiewicz's childhood environment exerted a major influence on his literary work.<ref name="cze208"/><ref name="psb694"/> His early years were shaped by immersion in [[Belarusian folklore]]<ref name="cze208"/> and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of [[Navahrudak Castle]] and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and [[Napoleon]]ic troops during [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia]].<ref name="psb694"/> The year 1812 also marked his father's death.<ref name="psb694"/> Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in [[Vilnius]].<ref name="psb695"/>

His first poems, such as the 1818 "''Zima miejska''" ("City Winter") and the 1819 "''Kartofla''" ("Potato"), were classical in style, influenced by [[Voltaire]].<ref name="cze210"/><ref name="cze209"/> His poetry anthologies published in 1822 (including the opening poem "''Romantyczno<U+015B><U+0107>''", "Romanticism") and 1823 mark the start of [[romanticism in Poland]].<ref name="psb695"/><ref name="cze210"/><ref name="cze212"/> Mickiewicz's influence popularized the use of [[folklore]], folk literary forms, and [[historism]] in Polish romantic literature.<ref name="psb695"/> His exile to Moscow exposed him to a cosmopolitan environment, more international than provincial [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]] in Lithuania.<ref name="psb696"/> This period saw a further evolution in his writing style, with ''Sonety'' (Sonnets, 1826) and ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' (1828), both published in Russia.<ref name="psb696"/> The ''Sonety'', mainly comprising his ''{{Ill|pl|Crimean Sonnets|Sonety krymskie}}'', highlight the poet's ability and desire to write, and his longing for his homeland.<ref name="psb696"/>

One of his major works, ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (Forefathers' Eve), comprises several parts written over an extended period of time.<ref name="psb698"/><ref name="cze214217"/> It began with publication of parts II and IV in 1823.<ref name="psb695"/> [[Czes<U+0142>aw Mi<U+0142>osz|Mi<U+0142>osz]] remarks that it was "Mickiewicz's major theatrical achievement", a work which Mickiewicz saw as ongoing and to be continued in further parts.<ref name="cze222"/><ref name="cze214217"/> Its title refers to the [[pagan]] ancestor commemoration that had been practiced by [[Slavic nations|Slavic]] and [[Balts|Baltic]] peoples on [[All Souls' Day]].<ref name="cze214217"/> The year 1832 saw the publication of part III:  much superior to the earlier parts, a "laboratory of innovative genres, styles and forms".<ref name="psb698"/>  Part III was largely written over a few days; the "Great Improvisation" section, a "masterpiece of Polish poetry", is said to have been created during a single inspired night.<ref name="psb698"/>  A long descriptive poem, "''Ust<U+0119>p''" (Digression), accompanying part III and written sometime before it, sums up Mickiewicz's experiences in, and views on, Russia, portrays it as a huge prison, pities the oppressed Russian people, and wonders about their future.<ref name="cze224225"/>  Mi<U+0142>osz describes it as a "summation of Polish attitudes towards Russia in the nineteenth century" and notes that it inspired responses from Pushkin ("[[The Bronze Horseman (poem)|The Bronze Horseman]]") and [[Joseph Conrad]] (''[[Under Western Eyes]]'').<ref name="cze224225"/> The drama was first staged by [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Wyspia<U+0144>ski]] in 1901, becoming, in Mi<U+0142>osz's words, "a kind of national sacred play, occasionally forbidden by censorship because of its emotional impact upon the audience."  The Polish government's 1968 closing down of a production of the play sparked the [[1968 Polish political crisis]].<ref name="cze223"/><ref name="Olszewska2007"/>

Mickiewicz's ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' (1828), a [[narrative poem]] describing battles of the Christian order of [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]] against the [[pagan]]s of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]],<ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/> is a thinly veiled allusion to the long feud between Russia and Poland.<ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/><ref name="psb696"/> The plot involves the use of subterfuge against a stronger enemy, and the poem analyzes moral dilemmas faced by the Polish insurgents who would soon launch the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].<ref name="psb696"/> Controversial to an older generation of readers, ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' was seen by the young as a call to arms and was praised as such by an Uprising leader, poet {{Ill|pl|Ludwik Nabielak}}.<ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/><ref name="psb696"/> Mi<U+0142>osz describes ''Konrad Wallenrod'' (named for its protagonist) as "the most committed politically of all Mickiewczi's poems."<ref name="cze221"/> The point of the poem, though obvious to many, escaped the Russian censors, and the poem was allowed to be published, complete with its telling motto drawn from [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]: ''"Dovete adunque sapere come sono duo generazioni da combattere <U+2013> bisogna essere volpe e leone."'' ("Ye shall know that there are two ways of fighting <U+2013> you must be a fox and a lion.")<ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/><ref name="psb696"/><ref name="cze220"/> On a purely literary level, the poem was notable for incorporating traditional folk elements alongside stylistic innovations.<ref name="psb696"/>

Similarly noteworthy is Mickiewicz's earlier and longer 1823 poem, ''[[Gra<U+017C>yna (poem)|Gra<U+017C>yna]]'', depicting the exploits of a Lithuanian chieftainess against the Teutonic Knights.<ref name="cze213"/><ref name="cze214"/> Mi<U+0142>osz writes that ''Gra<U+017C>yna'' "combines a metalic beat of lines and syntactical rigor with a plot and motifs dear to the Romantics."<ref name="cze213"/> It is said by [[Christien Ostrowski]] to have inspired [[Emilia Plater]], a military heroine of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].<ref name="The Westminster Review"/> A similar message informs Mickiewicz's "''Oda do m<U+0142>odo<U+015B>ci''" ("[[Ode to Youth]]").<ref name="psb695"/>

Mickiewicz's ''{{Ill|pl|Crimean Sonnets|Sonety krymskie}}'' (1825<U+2013>26) and poems that he would later write in Rome and Lausanne,  Mi<U+0142>osz notes, have been "justly ranked among the highest achievements in Polish [lyric poetry]."<ref name="cze220"/> His 1830 travels in Italy likely inspired him to consider religious matters, and produced some of his best religiously-themed works, such as "''Arcymistrz''" ("The Master") and "''Do Marceliny <U+0141>empickiej''" ("To Marcelina <U+0141>empicka").<ref name="psb697"/>  He was an authority to the young insurgents of 1830<U+2013>31, who expected him to participate in the fighting (the poet {{Ill|pl|Maurycy Gos<U+0142>awski}} wrote a dedicated poem urging him to do so).<ref name="psb697"/> Yet it is likely that Mickiewicz was no longer as idealistic and supportive of military action as he had been a few years earlier, and his new works such as "''Do matki Polki''" ("To a Polish Mother", 1830), while still patriotic, also began to reflect on the tragedy of resistance.<ref name="psb697"/> His meetings with refugees and escaping insurgents around 1831 resulted in works such as "''Reduta Ordona''" ("Ordon's Redoubt"), "''Nocleg''" ("Night Bivouac") and "''<U+015A>mier<U+0107> pu<U+0142>kownika''" ("Death of the Colonel").<ref name="psb697"/> Wyka notes the irony that some of the most important literary works about the 1830 Uprising were written by Mickiewicz, who never took part in a battle or even saw a battlefield.<ref name="psb697"/>

His ''Ksi<U+0119>gi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego'' (Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage, 1832) opens with a historical-philosophical discussion of the [[history of humankind]] in which Mickiewicz argues that history is the history of now-unrealized freedom that awaits many oppressed nations in the future.<ref name="psb698"/><ref name="psb699"/> It is followed by a longer "moral [[catechism]]" aimed at Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>s.<ref name="psb699"/> The book sets out a [[messianism#Russian and Slavic|messianist]] [[metaphor]] of Poland as the "[[Christ of Europe|Christ of nations]]".<ref name="cze226"/> Described by Wyka as a [[propaganda]] piece, it was relatively simple, using biblical metaphors and the like to reach less-discriminating readers.<ref name="psb699"/>  It became popular not only among Poles but, in translations, among some other peoples, primarily those which lacked their own sovereign states.<ref name="psb699"/><ref name="cze227"/> The ''Books'' were influential in framing Mickiewicz's image among many not as that of a poet and author but as that of ideologue of freedom.<ref name="psb699"/>
[[File:Manuscript of Pan Tadeusz 8pl.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Manuscript]] of ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', bearing ''(bottom right)'' his autograph signature]]
''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'' (published 1834), another of his masterpieces, is an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] that draws a picture of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] on the eve of [[Napoleon]]'s 1812 invasion of Russia.<ref name="psb699"/><ref name="cze227"/>  It is written entirely in thirteen-syllable [[couplet]]s.<ref name="cze227"/> Originally intended as an apolitical [[idyll]], it became, as Mi<U+0142>osz writes, "something unique in world literature, and the problem of how to classify it has remained the crux of a constant quarrel among scholars"; it "has been called 'the last epos' in world literature".<ref name="cze228"/>  ''Pan Tadeusz'' was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim as "the highest achievement in all Polish literature."<ref name="cze229"/>

The occasional poems that Mickiewicz wrote in his final decades have been described as "exquisite, gnomic, extremely short and concise".  His ''{{Ill|pl|Lausanne Lyrics|Liryki loza<U+0144>skie}}'', (1839<U+2013>40) are, writes Mi<U+0142>osz, "untranslatable masterpieces of metaphysical meditation. In Polish literature they are examples of that pure poetry that verges on silence."<ref name="cze230"/>

In the 1830s (as early as 1830; as late as 1837) he worked on a [[futurist]] or science-fiction work, ''A History of the Future''.<ref name="psb698"/> It predicted inventions similar to radio and television, and interplanetary communication using [[balloon]]s.<ref name="psb698"/>  Written in French, it was never completed and was partly destroyed by the author.<ref name="psb698"/> Other French-language works by Mickiewicz include the dramas ''Les Confederes de Bar'' (The [[Bar Confederation|Bar Confederates]]) and ''Jacques Jasi<U+0144>ski, ous les deux Polognes'' (Jacques Jasi<U+0144>ski, or the Two Polands).<ref name="psb699"/> These would not achieve much recognition, and would not be published till 1866.<ref name="psb699"/> While Mickiewicz did not write any poems in Lithuanian, and his command of that language has been described as likely limited, on one occasion in the early 1850s he transcribed a short [[folk song]] in that language, ''Ejk Tatuszeli i bytiu dar<U+017C>a''.<ref name="Jackiewicz1999"/><ref name="znadwiliiwilno"/><ref name="Surwi<U+0142>o1993"/>

A prime figure of the [[romanticism in Poland|Polish Romantic period]], Mickiewicz is counted as one of Poland's's [[Three Bards]] (the others being [[Zygmunt Krasi<U+0144>ski]] and [[Juliusz S<U+0142>owacki]]) and the greatest poet in all [[Polish literature]].<ref name="mickiewicz"/><ref name="mickiewicz1"/><ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2010"/> Mickiewicz has long been regarded as [[List of national poets#Europe|Poland's national poet]]<ref name="Adam Mickiewicz: the national poet of Poland"/><ref name="Krzyzanowski"/> and is a revered figure in [[Lithuania]].<ref name="www"/> He is also considered one of the greatest [[Slavic language|Slavic]]<ref name="PomorskaBaran1992"/> and [[Europea]]n<ref name="budowniczowie"/> poets. He has been described as a "Slavic bard".<ref name="fra"/> He was a leading Romantic dramatist<ref name="tm"/> and has been compared in Poland and in Europe with [[George Gordon Byron|Byron]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].<ref name=fra/><ref name=tm/>

Mickiewicz's importance extends beyond literature to the broader spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes that he was a "singer and epic poet of the Polish people, and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations."<ref name="psb704"/> Scholars have used the expression "cult of Mickiewicz" to describe the reverence in which he is held as a "national prophet."<ref name="psb704"/><ref name="Wachtel2006"/><ref name="Peterkiewicz1970"/> On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasi<U+0144>ski wrote: "For men of my generation, he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world."<ref name="psb704"/><ref name="MickiewiczAmerica1944"/> [[Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin]] described Mickiewicz's works as [[Prometheus|Promethean]], as "reaching more Polish hearts" than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]]' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as "healthier" than those of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Homer]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].<ref name="corwin"/> Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has "informed the foundations of [many] parties and ideologies" in Poland from the 19th century to this day, "down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'"<ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/> While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among "people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires."<ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/>

Mickiewicz has been written about or had works dedicated to him by many authors in Poland ([[Adam Asnyk|Asnyk]], [[Konstanty Ildefons Ga<U+0142>czy<U+0144>ski|Ga<U+0142>czy<U+0144>ski]], [[Jaros<U+0142>aw Iwaszkiewicz|Iwaszkiewicz]], [[Mieczys<U+0142>aw Jastrun|Jastrun]], [[Jan Kasprowicz|Kasprowicz]], [[Jan Lecho<U+0144>|Lecho<U+0144>]], [[Maria Konopnicka|Konopnicka]], [[Teofil Lenartowicz]], Norwid, [[Julian Przybo<U+015B>|Przybo<U+015B>]], [[Tadeusz R<U+00F3><U+017C>ewicz|R<U+00F3><U+017C>ewicz]], [[Antoni S<U+0142>onimski|S<U+0142>onimski]], S<U+0142>owacki, [[Leopold Staff|Staff]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer|Tetmajer]], [[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]], [[Kornel Ujejski|Ujejski]], [[Kazimierz Wierzy<U+0144>ski|Wierzy<U+0144>ski]], [[J<U+00F3>zef Bohdan Zaleski|Zaleski]] and others) and by authors outside Poland ([[Valery Bryusov|Bryusov]], Goethe, Pushkin, [[Ludwig Uhland|Uhland]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlick<U+00FD>|Vrchlick<U+00FD>]] and others).<ref name="psb704"/> He has been a character in works of fiction, including a large body of dramatized biographies, e.g., in 1900, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Wyspia<U+0144>ski]]'s ''Legion''.<ref name="psb704"/> He has also been a subject of many paintings, by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]], {{Ill|pl|J<U+00F3>zef Oleszkiewicz}}, [[Aleksander Or<U+0142>owski]], [[Wojciech Stattler]] and [[Walenty Wa<U+0144>kowicz]].<ref name="psb705"/> Monuments and other tributes (streets and schools named for him) abound in Poland and Lithuania, and in other former territories of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].<ref name="psb704"/><ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/> He has also been the subject of many statues and busts by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[David d'Angers]], {{Ill|pl|Antoni Kurzawa}}, [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Oleszczy<U+0144>ski]], {{Ill|pl|Zbigniew Pronaszko}}, [[Teodor Rygier]], [[Wac<U+0142>aw Szymanowski]] and {{Ill|pl|Jakub Tatarkiewicz}}.<ref name="psb705"/> In 1898, the 100th anniversary of his birth, a towering statue by [[Cyprian Godebski (sculptor)|Cyprian Godebski]] was erected in Warsaw.  Its base carries the inscription, "To the Poet from the People".<ref name="Warsaw and surroundings"/> In 1855, the 100th anniversary of his death, the [[University of Pozna<U+0144>]] adopted him as its official patron.<ref name="psb704"/>

A number of museums in Europe are dedicated to Mickiewicz.  [[Warsaw]] has an [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature, Warsaw|Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature]].<ref name="psb704"/> His house in [[Navahrudak]], [[Belarus]], is now a museum ({{Ill|pl|Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Navahrudak|Muzeum Adama Mickiewicza w Nowogr<U+00F3>dku}});<ref name="Muzeum Adama Mickiewicza w Nowogr<U+00F3>dku"/> as is the house where he lived and died in Istanbul ([[Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul]]).<ref name="psb704"/>  There is a ''[[Mus<U+00E9>e Adam Mickiewicz]]'' in [[Paris, France]].<ref name="Musee Adam Mickiewicz"/>

Much has been written about Mickiewicz, though the vast majority of this scholarly and popular literature is available only in Polish.  Works devoted to him, according to Koropeckyi, author of a 2008 English biography, "could fill a good shelf or two".<ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/> Koropeckyi notes that, apart from some specialist literature, only five book-length biographies of Mickiewicz have been published in English.<ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/> He also writes that, though many of Mickiewicz's works have been reprined numerous times, no language has a "definitive critical edition of his works."<ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/>

==Ethnicity==
[[File:Adomas Mickevi<U+010D>ius Reversum.png|thumb|thumb|[[Litas|Lithuanian coin]] featuring a stylized Mickiewicz]]
Adam Mickiewicz, whose works were written in the [[Polish language]],<ref name="O'Connor2006"/> is generally known as a [[List of Polish poets|Polish poet]].<ref name="O'Connor2006"/><ref name="Kridl1951"/><ref name="Murray2004"/><ref name="Classe2000"/><ref name="prospects"/> He is described by some authors as "[[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]]"<ref name="william"/><ref name="communicating"/> or [[Belarusians|Belarusian]]-Polish.<ref name="United Nations in Belarus - Culture"/><ref name="katolickiego"/> ''The Cambridge History of Russia'' describes him as Polish but sees his ethnic origins as "Lithuanian-Belarusian (and perhaps Jewish)."<ref name="The Cambridge History of Russia: Imperial Russia, 1689-1917"/> According to the Belarusian historian Rybczonek, Mickiewicz's mother had [[Tatar]] roots.<ref name="mickiewicza"/>

Some sources assert that Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, [[Jacob Frank|Frankist]] Jewish family.<ref name="movement"/><ref name="encyclopaedia"/><ref name="brotherhood"/> Others view this as improbable.<ref name="cze231"/><ref name="contemporaries"/><ref name="frankists"/><ref name="niniwa2"/> Polish historian [[Kazimierz Wyka]], in his biographic entry in ''[[Polski S<U+0142>ownik Biograficzny]]'' (1975) writes that this hypothesis, based on the fact that his mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among [[Frankism|Frankist]] Jews, has not been proven.<ref name="psb694"/> Wyka states that poet's mother was the daughter of a noble (''[[szlachta]]'') family of [[Staryko<U+0144> coat of arms]], living on an estate at [[Czombr<U+00F3>w]] in [[Nowogr<U+00F3>dek Voivodeship (1507<U+2013>1795)|Nowogr<U+00F3>dek Voivodeship]] (Navahrudak Voivodeship).<ref name="psb694"/>

The Lithuanian scholar of literature {{Ill|lt|Juozapas Girdzijauskas}} writes that Mickiewicz's family was descended from an old [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian noble family]] (Rimvydas) with origins predating Lithuania's Christianization.<ref name="antologija"/> The Lithuanian nobility in Mickiewicz's time was heavily [[Polonized]] and spoke Polish.<ref name=venc/> Mickiewicz had been brought up in the culture of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a multicultural state that had encompassed most of what today are the separate countries of [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. To Mickiewicz, a splitting of that multicultural state into separate entities, due to trends such as [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian separatism]], was undesirable,<ref name=venc/> if not outright unthinkable.<ref name="O'Connor2006"/> According to Romanucci-Ross, while Mickiewicz called himself a "Lithuanian", in his time the idea of a separate "Lithuanian identity", apart from a "Polish" one, did not exist.<ref name="prospects"/>  This multicultural aspect is evident in his works; his most famous poetic work, ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', begins with the Polish-language invocation, "O Lithuania, my country, thou art like good health&nbsp;..." (''"Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jeste<U+015B> jak zdrowie&nbsp;..."'') <U+2014> an invocation that, after its translation into [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], was eventually incorporated into the [[Lithuanian anthem|Lithuanian national anthem]].<ref name="O'Connor2006"/><ref name="disc"/> It is generally accepted, however, that Mickiewicz, when referring to Lithuania, meant a historical region rather than a linguistic and cultural entity, and he often applied the term "Lithuanian" to the Slavic inhabitants of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref name="venc"/>
