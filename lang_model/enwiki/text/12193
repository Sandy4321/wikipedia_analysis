'''Neurofeedback (NFB)''', also called '''neurotherapy''' or '''neurobiofeedback''', is a type of [[biofeedback]] that uses realtime displays of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) or [[hemoencephalography]] (HEG) to illustrate brain activity and teach self-regulation. EEG neurofeedback uses sensors that are placed on the scalp to measure brain waves, while HEG neurofeedback uses infrared (IR) sensors or [[fMRI|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] to measure brain blood flow.

==Definition==

Neurofeedback is a type of [[biofeedback]] that measures brain waves or brain blood flow to produce a signal that can be used as feedback on brain activity to teach self-regulation. Feedback is commonly provided using video or sound, with positive feedback for desired brain activity and negative feedback for brain activity that is undesirable.

Anecdotal research shows neurofeedback can be an effective intervention for a range of brain-related conditions. Neurofeedback is regularly used by hundreds of clinical practitioners worldwide to help clients with various conditions, and ongoing research continues to investigate the effectiveness of different techniques for treating [[addiction]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2524976 | title=Alpha-theta brainwave training and beta-endorphin levels in alcoholics. | author=Peniston EG, Kulkosky PJ. | journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | year=1989 | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=271<U+2013>279 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1989.tb00325.x}}</ref> [[ADHD]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21842168 | title=Neurofeedback in ADHD: a single-blind randomized controlled trial. | author=Bakhshayesh AR, H<U+00E4>nsch S, Wyschkon A, Rezai MJ, Esser G. | journal=European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry | year=2011 | volume=20 | issue=9 | pages=481<U+2013>491 | doi=10.1007/s00787-011-0208-y}}</ref> [[aggression]], [[anxiety]], [[autism]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19856096 | title=Neurofeedback for autistic spectrum disorder: a review of the literature. | author=Coben R, Linden M, Myers TE. | journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | year=2010 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=83<U+2013>105 | doi=10.1007/s10484-009-9117-y.}}</ref> [[Depression (mood)|depression]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22675513 | title=Real-time self-regulation of emotion networks in patients with depression. | author=Linden DE, Habes I, Johnston SJ, Linden S, Tatineni R, Subramanian L, Sorger B, Healy D, Goebel R. | journal=PLoS One | year=2012 | volume=7 | issue=6 | pages=e38115 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038115}}</ref> [[epilepsy]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22675513 | title=Meta-analysis of EEG biofeedback in treating epilepsy. | author=Tan G, Thornby J, Hammond DC, Strehl U, Canady B, Arnemann K, Kaiser DA. | journal=Journal of Clinical EEG & Neuroscience | year=2009 | volume=40 | issue=3 | pages=173<U+2013>179}}</ref> [[headaches]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J184v08n03_03#.UY6R5bWG2Ak | title=Passive Infrared Hemoencephalography: Four Years and 100 Migraines. | author=Jeffrey A.

== Treatment of ADHD ==
Research into neurofeedback has been limited and of low quality.<ref name="pmid22930416"/> While there is some indication on the effectiveness of biofeedback for ADHD it is not conclusive: several studies have yielded positive results, however the best designed ones have either shown reduced effects or non-existing ones.<ref name="pmid22930416"/><ref name="pmid22890816">{{cite journal |author=Lofthouse N, Arnold LE, Hurt E |title=Current status of neurofeedback for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=536<U+2013>42 |year=2012 |month=October |pmid=22890816 |doi=10.1007/s11920-012-0301-z |url=}}</ref> No serious adverse side effects from neurofeedback have been reported.<ref name="pmid22930416">{{cite journal |author=Moriyama TS, Polanczyk G, Caye A, Banaschewski T, Brandeis D, Rohde LA |title=Evidence-based information on the clinical use of neurofeedback for ADHD |journal=Neurotherapeutics |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=588<U+2013>98 |year=2012 |month=July |pmid=22930416 |doi=10.1007/s13311-012-0136-7 |url=}}</ref>

QEEG has been used to develop EEG models of ADHD that are generally characterized by an abundance of slow theta brain waves and a diminished quantity of fast beta wave activity.<ref name = "Butnik" /> These models are used to develop neurofeedback therapies that positively reinforce normal brain wave patterns and discourage ADHD brain wave patterns.

Some ADHD researchers were unconvinced by the early studies, including [[Russell Barkley]]. Barkley and Loo <ref>Barkley, R. A. & Loo, S. (2005).  Clinical utility of EEG in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Applied Neuropsychology, 12(2), 64-76</ref> reviewed the available literature in 2005 on neurotherapy's effectiveness in treating ADHD and concluded that most early studies were uncontrolled [[case studies]], did not use blinded methods to insure that those involved in the investigation were not aware of treatment assignments in order to rule out the [[placebo effect]].

Better subsequent studies of this treatment for ADHD have now been published. These more recent studies along with any early ones using appropriate scientific methods were reviewed concluding that neurofeedback was probably efficacious but that the available evidence was hardly conclusive.<ref>Lofthouse, N. et al. (2011).   A review of neurofeedback treatment for pediatric ADHD.  Journal of Attention Disorders, 1087054711427530, first published online November 16, 2011 as {{doi|10.1177/1087054711427530}}.</ref><ref>Lofthouse, N. et al. (2011).  Biofeedback and neurofeedback treatment for ADHD.  Psychiatric Annals, 41(1), 42-47.</ref> However, another meta-analysis, which included  many of the earlier poorly controlled studies found a larger magnitude of treatment effects.<ref>Arns, M. et al. (2009).  Efficacy of neurofeedback treatment in ADHD.  Clinical EEG and Neuroscience, 40(3), 180-189.</ref>

Further research on the benefits of neurofeedback for ADHD is clearly warranted given this history of mixed results. Future research on this treatment needs to employ appropriate sham neurofeedback or other attention-placebo control groups, double-blinded procedures and measures of ADHD collected both in school and at home to better evaluate the efficacy of this treatment for ADHD.

== History and application ==

In 1924, the German psychiatrist Hans Berger connected a couple of electrodes (small round discs of metal) to a patient's scalp and detected a small current by using a ballistic [[galvanometer]].  During the years 1929-1938 he published 14 reports about his studies of EEGs, and much of our modern knowledge of the subject, especially in the middle frequencies, is due to his research.<ref name = "Kaiser">Kaiser, David A.  "Basic Principles of Quantitative EEG."  ''Journal of Adult Development'', Vol. 12, Nos. 2/3, August 2005</ref> Berger analyzed EEGs qualitatively, but in 1932&nbsp;G. Dietsch applied [[Fourier analysis]] to seven records of EEG and became the first researcher of what later is called QEEG (quantitative EEG).<ref name = "Kaiser" />

Later, Joe Kamiya popularized neurofeedback in the 1960s when an article<ref name="Kamiya1971">{{cite journal

In the first part, a subject was asked to keep his eyes closed and when a tone sounded to say whether he thought he was in [[alpha rhythm|alpha]]. He was then told whether he was correct or wrong. Initially the subject would get about fifty percent correct, but some subjects would eventually develop the ability to distinguish between states and be correct a highly significant percentage of the time.<ref name="Frederick2012">{{cite journal

Once again some subjects were able to enter the state on command. Others, however, could not control it at all. Nevertheless, the results were significant and very attractive. Alpha states were connected with relaxation, and alpha training had the possibility to alleviate stress and stress-related conditions.

Despite these highly dramatic claims, the universal correlation of high alpha density to a subjective experience of calm cannot be assumed. Alpha states do not seem to have the universal stress-alleviating power indicated by early observations.<ref name="Hardt1978">{{cite journal | author = Hardt, J.V. | coauthors = Kamiya, J. | year = 1978 | title= Anxiety change through electroencephalographic alpha feedback seen only in high anxiety subjects | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4350 | pages = 79<U+2013>81 | doi = 10.1126/science.663641 | pmid = 663641}}</ref> At one point, [[Martin Theodore Orne|Martin Orne]] and others challenged the claim that alpha biofeedback actually involved the training of an individual to voluntarily regulate brainwave activity.<ref name="Paskewitz1973">{{cite journal | author = Paskewitz, D.A. | coauthors = Orne, M.T. | year = 1973 | title = Visual Effects on Alpha Feedback Training | journal = Science | volume = 181 | issue = 4097 | pages = 360<U+2013>363 | doi = 10.1126/science.181.4097.360 | pmid = 4719909}}</ref> James Hardt and Joe Kamiya, then at [[University of California, San Francisco|UC San Francisco]]'s [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute|Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute]] published a paper,<ref name="Hardt1976">{{cite journal | author = Hardt, J.V. | coauthors = Kamiya, J. | year = 1976 | title = Conflicting results in EEG alpha feedback studies | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 1

In the late sixties and early seventies, [[Barbara Brown (scientist)|Barbara Brown]], one of the most effective popularizers of Biofeedback, wrote several books on biofeedback, making the public much more aware of the technology.  The books included ''New Mind New Body'', with a foreword from [[Hugh Downs]], and ''Stress and the Art of Biofeedback''. Brown took a creative approach to neurofeedback, linking brainwave self-regulation to a switching relay which turned on an electric train.

The work of Barry Sterman, Joel F. Lubar and others has indicated a high efficacy for beta training, involving the role of sensorimotor rhythmic EEG activity.<ref name="Sterman1962">{{cite journal

For example Sterman has shown that both monkeys and cats who had undergone SMR training had elevated thresholds for the convulsant chemical monomethylhydrazine. These studies indicate that SMR is associated with an inhibitory process in the motor system and therefore increasing SMR through operant conditioning increases the ability to control seizures.<ref name=Sterman2000 />

Neuroimaging studies have correlated ADHD with abnormal functioning in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during tasks involving selective attention. In 2006, Johanne Levesque et al. published results from their fMRI study showing normalization of ACC activation during a selective-attention task in ADHD subjects who had undergone neurofeedback training. Subjects in the study were randomly assigned to either the neurofeedback treatment group or a no-treatment control group, and subjects from the latter showed no difference in ACC activation compared to their baseline.<ref>Levesque, Johanne and Mario Beauregard.

Within the last 5<U+2013>10 years, neurofeedback has taken a new approach, in taking a second look at deep states. Alpha-theta training has been used in the treatment of alcoholism,<ref>http://www.neurofeedback-scotland.com/alpha-theta-brainwave.html</ref>  other addictions as well as [[anxiety]].<ref>http://www.neurofeedback-scotland.com/anxiety-disorders.html</ref>  This low frequency training differs greatly from the high frequency beta and SMR training that has been practiced for over thirty years and is reminiscent of the original alpha training of Elmer Green and Joe Kamiya. Beta and SMR training can be considered a more directly physiological approach, strengthening sensorimotor inhibition in the cortex and inhibiting alpha patterns, which slow metabolism. Alpha-theta training, however, derives from the psychotherapeutic model and involves accessing of painful or repressed memories through the alpha-theta state. The alpha-theta state is a term that comes from the representation on the EEG.

The most recent development in the field is a conceptual approach called the Coordinated Allocation of Resource Model (CAR) of brain functioning which states that specific cognitive abilities are a function of specific electrophysiological variables which can overlap across different cognitive tasks.<ref>Thornton, K. & Carmody, D. Eyes-Closed and Activation QEEG Databases in Predicting Cognitive Effectiveness and the Inefficiency Hypothesis, Journal of Neurotherapy, 2009, (13) 1, 1-22</ref> The activation database guided EEG biofeedback approach initially involves evaluating the subject on a number of academically relevant cognitive tasks and compares the subject's values on the QEEG measures to a normative database, in particular on the variables that are related to success at that task.

The approach has been able to improve auditory memory some 3 standard deviations (or 300%) in a group of 20 memory impaired learning disabled and attention deficit disorder children. The subject's memory was better than the control group following the treatment.<ref>Thornton, K. & Carmody, D. EEG Biofeedback for Reading Disabilities and Traumatic Brain Injuries. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, Jan., 2005, 137-162.</ref> Reading memory in a group of 7 reading disabled children has been shown to increase by some 2.4 standard deviations (or 334%) with this approach.<ref name="Thornton, K 2010"/> Published research has also indicated a 2.61 standard deviation improvement in a group of 19 mild-moderate traumatic brain injured patients. These patients also were performing above the control group at the end of the treatment period.<ref name="Thornton, K. 2008"/><ref name="Thornton, K. 2009"/>

==Non-medical applications==
In addition to a variety of medical applications, neurofeedback has shown considerable promise in increasing athletic performance in sports by helping to enhance concentration and attention, reduce anxiety, improve physical balance, and control emotions. The demands placed on the brain differ according to which sport is being played and research in sports psychology has begun to examine the various brainwave patterns associated with different types of peak performance.<ref name=Hammond>{{cite journal|last=Hammond|first=D.

However, athletes in different sports may need neurofeedback to decrease alpha activity in order to produce a different kind of concentration or arousal required for peak performance. Research has demonstrated that the wrong type of neurofeedback can also decrease performance and thus a one-size-fits-all solution can<U+2019>t be applied indiscriminately across all varieties of sports.<ref name=Hammond/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Landers|first=D.M.|coauthors=Han, M.; Salazar, W.; & Petruzzello, S.J.|title=Effects of learning on electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic patterns in novice archers|journal=International Journal of Sport Psychology|year=1994|volume=25|issue=3|pages=313<U+2013>330}}</ref>

Alpha-theta neurofeedback, in conjunction with [[heart rate variability|heart rate variability training]], a form of [[biofeedback]], has also produced benefits in dance by enhancing performance in competitive ballroom dancing and increasing cognitive creativity in contemporary dancers. Additionally, neurofeedback has also been shown to instil a superior [[flow (psychology)|flow state]] in actors, possibly due to greater immersion while performing.<ref name=Gruzelier/>

==Neurofeedback in practice==
A common professional neurofeedback therapy session today goes as follows:

# In an intake of about 90&nbsp;minutes the patient will get a questionnaire and a first EEG reading. The questionnaire specifies the complaints and also helps to indicate if the referral to a specialist might be called for. In some cases but not all a full EEG will be recorded.
# If a full EEG is called for, the EEG recording is typically done on 19 - 21 sites on the scalp. It results in a brainmap ("quantitative EEG"). This is a series of maps (for each frequency one) where for each measured spot the average level of activity is shown. The brainmap is compared to a database to determine spots of over- and under activity compared to the average people of the patient's age and sex. There are several commercial providers of such databases.
# The actual session itself involves placing sensors on the head. The feedback may involve, for example, a simple light or tone or game that will move and play when certain brain activity is detected by the system. For other brain activity the rewarding tone, or light or game is taken away.
# A typical course of sessions takes 20 to 40 visits. At the beginning of each session the patient reports the course of his complaints and also mentions other mental effects. On the basis of this report the therapy may be adjusted. In some cases a patient is allowed to take a feedback machine home and have most - but not all - sessions there.

==Neuroplasticity==

In 2010, a study provided the first evidence of [[neuroplastic]] changes occurring directly after natural brainwave training. Half an hour of voluntary control of brain rhythms was shown to be sufficient to induce a lasting shift in cortical excitability and intracortical function.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310114936.htm Science Daily]</ref>  Ros et al.  observed that the cortical response to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) was significantly enhanced after neurofeedback, persisted for at least 20&nbsp;minutes, and was correlated with an EEG time-course indicative of [[activity-dependent plasticity]].<ref name="Ros2010">{{cite journal

==Criticism==
Two reviews of the literature, conducted in 2002, claimed that while biofeedback can be used to modify brain waves, the practice did not provide therapeutic benefit.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kline|first=John|coauthors=Corinne N. Brann, Bryan R. Loney|title=A Cacophony in the Brainwaves: A Critical Appraisal of Neurotherapy for Attention-Deficit Disorders|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice|date=Summer 2002|volume=1|url=http://www.srmhp.org/0101/neurotherapy-for-add.html|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> These reviews suggested that the research methodologies used in neurofeedback studies were inadequate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lohr|first=Jeffrey|coauthors=Suzanne A. Meunier, Lisa M. Parker, John P. Kline|title=Neurotherapy does not qualify as an Empirically supported Behavioral Treatment for Psychological Disorders|journal=Science & Pseudoscience Review in Mental Health|year=2002|month=November|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010603063635/www.pseudoscience.org/Neurotherapy/title-page.htm|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

In October 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics recognized that the scientific literature on biofeedback (including neurofeedback) provides "Level 1, Best Support" as an evidence-based child and adolescent psychosocial intervention.<ref>{{cite journal|last=American Academy of Pediatrics|title=evidence-based child and adolescent psychosocial intervention|year=2012|month=October|url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Mental-Health/Documents/CRPsychosocialInterventions.pdf}}</ref> Furthermore, meta-analyses of the extant scientific literature also document the efficacy of neurofeedback and addressed criticisms claiming that there were significant flaws in the research methodologies of previous studies.<ref>Arns, M. et al.
