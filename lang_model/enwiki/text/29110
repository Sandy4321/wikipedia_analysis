'''''Argentina anserina''''', commonly known as '''Silverweed''', is a flowering [[perennial plant]] in the rose family [[Rosaceae]]. It is native throughout the temperate [[Northern Hemisphere]], often on river shores and in grassy habitats such as meadows and road-sides. The plant was formerly classified in the genus ''[[Potentilla]]'' but has recently been reclassified into the new genus ''[[Argentina (plant)|Argentina]]''.

Silverweed is a low-growing [[herbaceous]] plant with creeping red [[stolon]]s up to 80 cm long. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are 10-20 cm long, evenly pinnate into in crenate leaflets 2-5 cm long and 1-2 cm broad, covered with silky white [[trichome|hairs]], particularly on the underside. These hairs are also present on the stem and the stolons. These give the leaves the silvery appearance from which the plant gets its name. 

The [[flower]]s are produced singly on 5-15 cm long stems, 1.5-2.5 cm diameter with five (rarely up to seven) yellow petals. The [[fruit]] is a cluster of dry [[achene]]s.

It is difficult to distinguish ''A. anserina'' from ''[[Eged's Silverweed|A. egedii]]'' (the only other species in the genus), the two taxa only differing in characters of the hairs; some botanists treat ''A. egedii'' as a [[subspecies]] of ''A. anserina''.

Silverweed is most often found in [[sand]]y or [[gravel]]ly soils, where it may spread rapidly by its prolific rooting stolons. It typically occurs in inland habitats, unlike ''A. egedii'', which is a [[sodium chloride|salt]]-tolerant [[coast]]al [[saltmarsh]] plant.

===Cultivation and uses===
Herbal tea from the underground roots is used to help delivery, and as [[antispasmodic]] for [[diarrhea]]. The plant was also put in shoes to absorb [[sweat]]. Howard (1987) states that it was formerly used as a treatment for [[epilepsy]], and that it could ward off [[witch]]es and evil spirits.<ref>Howard, Michael. ''Traditional Folk Remedies'' (Century, 1987), p.121.</ref>

The plant has been cultivated as a [[food crop]] for its edible roots. The usual wild forms, however, are impractical for this use, as they are small and are hard to clean. It may also become a problem [[weed]] in gardens.

===Etymology and folklore===
The pre-Linnaean name ''anserina'' means "of the [[goose]]" (''Anser''), either because the plant was used to feed them or because the leaves reminded of the bird's footmarks.

A rich [[folklore]] has developed around Silverweed. The plant bears the common name of ''richette'' in [[French language|French]], being rich through both silver and gold.
