'''Marquette''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]].  As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], the city population was 19,661, with the a 2005 population estimate of 20,714. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]][[Geographic references|<sup>6</sup>]].  Marquette is a major port on [[Lake Superior]], primarily for shipping [[iron ore]], and is the home of [[Northern Michigan University]]. It is the largest city on the [[Upper Peninsula]]. The city of Marquette averages about 170 inches of snow per year, making it the second snowiest city in the [[contiguous United States]].

==History==
Marquette was founded by Amos Harlow and his expedition leader Peter White. The city was originally named ''Worcester'' (pronounced WOOS ter; the "or" spoken like the "oo" in book), after Amos Harlow's hometown, [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. It is now named for the French explorer [[Jacques Marquette]].  Marquette has always been a shipping port for [[hematite]] ores and now enriched [[iron ore]] pellets from nearby mines and pelletizing plants.  The city includes several small islands (principally Middle Island, Gull Island, Lover's Island, Presque Isle Pt. Rocks, White Rocks, Ripley Rock, and Picnic Rocks) in Lake Superior.  The [[Marquette Underwater Preserve]] lies immediately offshore.  A regional medical center, [[Marquette General Hospital]], serving much of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] is located in the city.   [[Marquette Mountain]], used for [[skiing]], is located in the city, as is the majority of the land of [[Marquette Branch Prison]]. [[Trowbridge Park, Michigan|Trowbridge Park]] (an unincorporated part of Marquette Township) is located to the west, and [[Marquette Township, Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette Township]] to the northwest of the city.  

Marquette is home to the largest wooden dome in the world, the [[Superior Dome]].  Northern Michigan University owns the facility and holds its home football games there.  The dome also hosts numerous private and public events which draw in thousands from around the region. 

South of the city, [[K.I. Sawyer AFB]], was an important [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] installation during the [[Cold War]], host to [[B-52H]] bombers and [[KC-135]] tankers of the [[Strategic Air Command]], as well as a fighter interceptor squadron.  The base closed in September 1995, and is now home to the county's [[Sawyer International Airport]].

In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] made a campaign stop in Marquette, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to visit Michigan's Upper Peninsula since [[William H. Taft]] in 1911. 

The Roman Catholic Bishop [[Frederic Baraga]] is buried at [[St. Peter Cathedral, Marquette|St. Peter's Cathedral]].

Marquette is the [[sister city]] of [[Kajaani]], [[Finland]] and [[Higashiomi, Shiga]], [[Japan]]. (Formerly [[Yokaichi]], Japan.)

The city has two popular [[beaches]], South Beach Park and McCarty's Cove. McCarty's Cove, flanked by the red U.S. Coast Guard Station lighthouse on its south shore, serves as a reprieve from hot summer days, where city and county residents alike take advantage of the cool, but tolerable, water temperatures and the cooling effects of the lake-generated [[sea breeze]]. Both beaches have picnic areas, grills, children's playgrounds, and lifeguards. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Other parks include Tourist Park, Founder's Landing, LaBonte Park, Mattson Lower Harbor Park, Park Cemetery, Shiras Park, Williams Park, Harlow Park, Pocket Park, Spring Street Park, and Father Marquette Park.

Marquette has very beutiful landscapes including very light green buds in the summer. In the winter Marquette normally goes dry for about 3 months. When spring comes around the buds come out again.

There are also numerous other recreational facilities located within the city.  [[Lakeview Arena]] is mostly known for its use as an ice hockey facility, but it also hosts a number of public events.  A skateboard park is located just outside of the arena and open during the summer.  Lakeview Arena is home to the Marquette Electricians, the Marquette Redmen high school, and the new [[Marquette Rangers]] hockey teams. In [[1974]], the arena replaced the historic [[Palestra (Michigan)|Palestra]], which had been located a few blocks away.

Marquette also has an extensive network of biking and walking paths throughout the city.  The city has been gradually expanding the paths throughout the years and has been promoting itself as a walkable and livable community.  Cross Country ski trails are also located at Presque Isle Park and the Fit Strip. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Camping facilities are also located at Tourist Park.

==Museums and galleries==

Tours of the historic Marquette Harbor Lighthouse are also available. [http://mqtmaritimemuseum.com/]

Marquette consists of a number of neighborhoods, not including Picnic Rocks:

* "The Village" - The Village is generally perceived to extend from Washington to Fair Ave., and from 4th Street Eastward to Lake Shore Boulevard. The Village contains a unique mile long shopping district with shops, gift shops, banks, and restaurants located on Third Street. This unique and diverse neighborhood is also home to many NMU students and faculty, as well as some of Marquette's oldest residences. "The Village" also encompasses all of the "East Side" which extends from Front Street to Lakeshore Blvd. It is very rare to hear residents living in the "East Side" to ever refer to their area as "The Village".
 {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
