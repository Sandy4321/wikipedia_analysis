==Biography==

===Early life===

Born in [[Beckenham]], [[Kent]],<ref name="CAP" /> Bryan showed an early talent for cricket when playing at school. After making a string of centuries whilst at school, he was referred to by [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] as the public school batsman of the year<ref name="WisObit" /> and made his first-class debut for [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] in a [[County Championship]] match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]<ref name="FCM">[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/28/28245/First-Class_Matches.html First-class matches played by Godfrey Bryan] at CricketArchive</ref> aged just 17.<ref name="CAP" /> He made an immediate impact by scoring 124 in the second [[Innings#Cricket|innings]] of the match.<ref name="WisObit" />

===Main cricket career===

He became a regular member of the Kent team during the [[1921 English cricket season|1921 season]], playing nine County Championship match in addition to a match against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]].<ref name="FCM" /> His top score of the year was the 179 he scored against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]].<ref name="WisObit" /> He played 13 County Championship matches for Kent the following year,<ref name="FCM" /> after which his Army career meant that his availability for [[county cricket]] was limited. The Army cricket team had first-class status at that time however, meaning that he was able to keep in touch with first-class cricket,<ref name="WisObit" /> playing for the Army against the [[Royal Navy Cricket Club|Royal Navy]] in 1923 in addition to four County Championship matches for Kent.<ref name="FCM" />

In 1924, he played in five County Championship matches for Kent, also playing first-class matches for the Army against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and the Royal Navy. He also played for the [[Combined Services cricket team|Combined Services]] that year,<ref name="FCM" /> scoring 229 for them against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]],<ref name="WisObit" /> his highest first-class score.<ref name="CAP" /> He played eight County Championship matches in 1925,<ref name="FCM" /> including one against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in which all three Bryan brothers played.<ref name="WisObit" /> He also played three first-class matches for the Army, against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], Oxford University and the Royal Navy.<ref name="FCM" />

His availability for Kent was even more curtailed in 1926, playing just one County Championship match against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] that season, also playing for them against Australia and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]]. He played a further three first-class matches for the Army, against the same opponents from the previous season. The following season, he played just once for Kent, against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in the County Championship, and played four matches for the Army, against their usual opponents in addition to [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]].<ref name="FCM" />

He played just three first-class matches in 1928, two for Kent against Middlesex and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], and one for the Army against the Royal Navy. He played three County Championship matches in 1929,<ref name="FCM" /> passing 3,000 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] in first-class cricket in the match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]].<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/13/13184.html Scorecard] of Kent v Sussex, [[20 July]] [[1929]] at CricketArchive</ref> He also played first-class matches for the Army against the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force that year.<ref name="FCM" />

===Later cricket career===

The first years of the 1930s saw a brief cessation in his cricket career in England as he was stationed in the [[Far East]], where he played two matches for the [[Straits Settlements cricket team|Straits Settlements]] against the [[Federated Malay States cricket team|Federated Malay States]] in 1930 and 1932.<ref name="OthM">[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/28/28245/Other_matches.html Other matches played by Godfrey Bryan] at CricketArchive</ref> Back in England, he played his final match for Kent in 1933 against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], also playing that year for the Army against the West Indies.<ref name="FCM" />

He played a non first-class match for the Army against Australia in 1934,<ref name="OthM" /> and played his final first-class match for the Army in 1935 against Cambridge University.<ref name="FCM" /> He continued cricket at a lower level, playing a third match for the Straits Settlements against the Federated Malay States in 1938. He played for the Army against the [[Minor counties of English cricket|Minor Counties]] in 1947, against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in 1949 and against Oxford University in 1951.<ref name="OthM" />
