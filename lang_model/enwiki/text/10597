'''Cermna Finn''', son of Ebric and a great great grandson of [[M<U+00ED>l Esp<U+00E1>ine]], was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, joint [[High King of Ireland]] with his brother [[Sobairce]].<ref>R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), ''Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V'', Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 211-213</ref> The pair came to power after Cermna killed the previous incumbent, [[Eochaid <U+00C9>tgudach]], in battle at [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. They were the first High Kings to come from the [[Ulaid]]. They divided the country between them, the border running from [[Drogheda]] to [[Limerick]].<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar <U+00C9>irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text035.html 1.25]</ref> Cermna ruled the southern half from D<U+00FA>n Cermna (which [[Geoffrey Keating|Keating]] identifies as Downmacpatrick in [[Kinsale]], [[County Cork]]), Sobairce the northern half from D<U+00FA>n Sobairce ([[Dunseverick]] in [[County Antrim]]). They ruled for forty years. Cermna was killed by [[Eochaid Faebar Glas]], son of the previous High King [[Conm<U+00E1>el]], in the battle of D<U+00FA>n Cermna. Sobairce died in the same year at the hands of Eochaid Menn, son of the king of the [[Fomorians]]. The ''[[Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn]]'' synchronises their reign with those of Laosthenes in [[Assyria]] and [[Rehoboam]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's ''Foras Feasa ar <U+00C9>irinn'' dates their reign to 1155-1115 BC, that of the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' to 1533-1493 BC.<ref>''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/text007.html M3667-3707]</ref>
