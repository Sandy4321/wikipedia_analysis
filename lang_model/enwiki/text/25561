{{Infobox Southern Railway (UK)}}
The '''Southern Railway''' (SR), was a British railway company established in the [[Railways Act 1921|1923 Grouping]]. It contained notable examples of civil engineering, linking London with the [[English Channel|Channel]] ports, [[South West England]] and [[Kent]]. The railway was formed by the amalgamation of several smaller railway companies, the largest of which were the [[London & South Western Railway]], the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]], and the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]].<ref name=bonavia1>Bonavia, 26</ref>  The construction of what was to become the Southern Railway began in 1838 with the opening of the [[London and Southampton Railway]], which was renamed the London & South Western Railway. 

The railway was noted for its astute use of public relations material and a coherent management structure headed by [[Herbert Ashcombe Walker|Sir Herbert Walker]].<ref name=bonavia>Bonavia, 28</ref> At 2,186 miles (3,518 km), the Southern was the smallest of the "Big Four" railway companies, which was conducive to a concerted electrification scheme on London's suburban railway network. The Southern played a vital role in the [[Second World War]] during the [[Dunkirk]] operations, as well as supplying [[Operation Overlord]] in 1944.  Throughout its existence, the railway was primarily a passenger line, hauling holidaymakers and commuters throughout the network. In an effort to maintain these services, the two Chief Mechanical Engineers, Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923.

The Southern operated a number of famous named trains, including the [[Brighton Belle]], the [[Bournemouth Belle]], the [[Golden Arrow]], and the [[Night Ferry]] (London - Paris and Brussels). The West Country services were dominated by lucrative summer holiday traffic and included named trains such as the [[Atlantic Coast Express]] and the [[Devon Belle]]. The company's best-known livery was highly distinctive: locomotives and carriages were painted in a bright [[Malachite green]] above plain black frames, with bold, bright yellow lettering. The Southern Railway was nationalised in 1948, becoming the [[Southern Region of British Railways]].

==History==
=== Constituent companies and formation in 1923 ===
:''See also: [[List of constituent companies of the Southern Railway]]''
The three major companies that operated along the south coast of England <U+2013> the [[London & South Western Railway]] (LSWR), the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LBSCR), and the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] (SECR) <U+2013> were amalgamated to form the Southern Railway in 1923, which operated 2186 route miles (3518 km) of railway.<ref name=Bonavia4>Bonavia, p. 26</ref> The key progenitor of the Southern was the London and Southampton Railway, which was renamed the LSWR in 1838 when the railway branched out to destinations including Portsmouth and Salisbury.<ref name=Wolmar1>Wolmar, pp. 72-74</ref> It was the traditions developed by the LSWR that set the standard for the operations in the rest of the Southern after 1923.<ref name=Whitehouse4>Whitehouse & Thomas, p. 11</ref> The LBSCR was a much smaller concern when compared to its neighbour, though served many holiday resorts on the South Coast and operated much of the south London suburban network. This ensured that services were well run, to the extent that electrification was begun in order to increase efficiency.<ref name=Whitehouse5>Whitehouse, & Thomas, pp. 11-12</ref> Finally, the SECR was a managing committee of two cash-strapped railways; the South Eastern and the London, Chatham and Dover.<ref name=Wolmar2>Wolmar, p. 223</ref> The organisation suffered from poor, over-abundant infrastructure and internal conflicts of interest, and was ripe for amalgamation in 1923.<ref name=Whitehouse1>Whitehouse & Thomas, p. 13</ref>

The formation of the Southern Railway was rooted in the outbreak of the [[First World War]], when all British railway companies were taken into government control. Many members of staff joined the armed forces and it was not possible to build and maintain equipment as easily as in peacetime. After the war the government considered permanent nationalisation but instead decided on a compulsory amalgamation of the railways into four large groups through the [[Railways Act 1921|1921 Railways Act]], known as the Grouping.<ref name=Wolmar3>Wolmar, p. 228</ref> The resultant amalgamation of the three south coast railways to form the Southern meant that several duplicate routes and management structures were inherited. Rationalisation had to take place, leading to the downgrading of some routes in favour of more direct lines to the channel ports, and the creation of a coordinated, but not necessarily centralised form of management based at the former LSWR headquarters in Waterloo station.<ref name=Whitehouse6>Whitehouse & Thomas, p. 15</ref> 

Along with the railway, the Southern inherited harbours along the south coast, including [[Southampton]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Dover]]. These had come into being for handling ocean-going intercontinental, as well as cross-[[English Channel|channel]] passenger traffic, and the size of the railway-owned installations reflected the prosperity that the industry generated. This traffic source ensured that the Southern would be a predominantly passenger-orientated railway, with the ports generating vast numbers of passenger journeys.

=== Electrification ===
{{seealso|Railway electrification in Great Britain|SR multiple unit numbering and classification}}
[[Image: SR-Good-Morning.jpg|left|frame|1933 poster for the Southern's newly-electrified suburban services]]
In 1929 the [[third-rail]] [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]] of the London suburban network was completed. The introduction of [[electric multiple units]] (EMUs) on principal [[suburban]] routes ensured fast, efficient [[commuter]] services into London, and increased the volume of commuter traffic. The Southern's commitment to electrification made the railway far more innovative in its approach to handling traffic that its rivals - compare the Southern's legacy with the absence from the Great Western Railway of even a single electrified route.

The already intensively-used commuter system in a relatively small geographical area made the Southern a natural candidate for electrification - the LSWR and the LBSCR had already introduced it for some of their lines in the London area before the Grouping. However, the two schemes were incompatible, with the LBSCR adopting a 6600 V AC overhead system (similar to that used by the Midland Railway for their [[Lancaster, England|Lancaster]] to [[Morecambe]] trial section), and the LSWR a 660 V DC third rail standard. After the Grouping a comparison of the two systems was made and the LSWR standard was adopted for the whole system, with the added advantage that it was cheaper to install, with no [[catenary]] equipment required.

Most of the area immediately south of [[London]] was converted, together with the long-distance lines to [[Brighton]], [[Eastbourne]] and [[Portsmouth]]. Starting in 1931, this was one of the world's first modern mainline electrification schemes. Only the suburban part of the former SECR routes was electrified by the Southern, although the long-distance Kent routes were next in line for electrification, and would have been followed by the electrification of the Southampton/Bournemouth route. The [[Second World War]] interrupted these plans, and these lines were electrified in the late 1950s and late 1960s respectively.

=== Economic crisis of the 1930s ===
The post-[[Wall Street Crash]] era halted further development of the electrification project, but the investment the company had already made in modernising the commuter network ensured that the Southern remained in relatively good financial health despite the Depression. However, this marked the end of the first period under [[Chief Mechanical Engineer]] (CME) [[Richard Maunsell]] when the Southern Railway led the field in steam locomotive design, as the lack of funds affected the development of new, standardised motive power. It would take until the Second World War for the Southern to take the initiative in steam locomotive design once again. 

=== Second World War ===
[[Image: Shabby.jpg|right|thumb|1945 poster ('Shabby?') by L. A. Webb promising post-war Southern refurbishment and showing Malachite Green and Sunshine Yellow livery]]
The holiday makers that used the lines to the channel ports and the West Country were replaced with troops, especially with the threat of a German invasion on the South Coast in 1940.<ref name=Hendry> Hendry, p. 21 </ref> Before hostilities, 75% of its traffic was passenger, 25% freight; during the war roughly the same number of passengers was carried, but freight grew to 60% of total traffic. A desperate shortage of freight locomotives was remedied by CME [[Oliver Bulleid]], whilst the volume of military freight and soldiers moved by a primarily commuter and holidaymaker carrying railway was a breathtaking feat.

When the threat of invasion receded, the region served by the Southern became the marshalling area for troops preparing to invade [[Normandy]] in [[Operation Overlord]], and once again the railway played its part in providing an efficient link in the logistics chain.<ref name=Hendry>Hendry, p. 21</ref>  This came at a cost, as the Southern's location around London and the Channel Ports meant that it was subjected to heavy bombing, whilst permanent way, locomotive, carriage and wagon maintenance was deferred until the end of the conflict.<ref name=Hendry1>Hendry, p. 23</ref>

=== Nationalisation ===
After a period of slow recovery in the late 1940s, the war-devastated company was nationalised along with the rest of the [[Great Britain|British]] railway network in 1948 and incorporated into the [[British Rail|British Railways]].<ref name=Hendry2>Hendry, p. 50</ref> The Southern retained a separate identity as the [[Southern Region of British Railways]]. Many of its lines in [[London]] and [[Kent]] had been damaged during the war and much of the [[rolling stock]] was either damaged or badly in need of replacement. At the time of nationalisation the Southern had started a vigorous programme of rebuilding and renewal, and this was continued throughout the early 1950s.<ref name=Hendry3>Hendry, p. 58</ref>

=== Revival in the privatised network ===
:''See: [[Southern (train operating company)]]''
The name '''Southern''' has been revived as a rebranding of ''South Central'', which operates the former LBSCR routes to South London, Surrey and Sussex from Victoria and London Bridge. Southern is owned by [[Govia]] <U+2014> a joint venture between transport groups [[Go-Ahead Group]] and [[Keolis]] <U+2014> which also owns the neighbouring ''[[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]''. Officially named ''New Southern Railway Ltd'', it was branded ''Southern'' on [[30 May]] [[2004]] in a deliberate recall of the pre-nationalisation Southern Railway, with a green roundel logo with "Southern" written in yellow in a green bar.

== Geography ==

The vast majority of territory that the railway served was centred on the south west main lines between London, Southampton, Weymouth, Plymouth, Salisbury and Exeter, some subject to competition from the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR). East of the capital the Southern held a monopoly over services to Dover and Brighton. Generally confined to the area south of the [[River Thames]], the Southern owned no track north of London. In addition to these was a network of secondary routes intertwining mainlines and providing inter-company services, an example being the line from the GWR at Reading to Guildford. 

Unlike the three other railways established by the Grouping (the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] and the [[Great Western Railway]]), the Southern was predominantly a passenger railway. Despite its small size it carried more than a quarter of the UK's passenger traffic because its area included many of the dense commuter lines around London, serving some of the most densely populated parts of the country. In addition, because South London's geology (unlike that of the rest of the capital city) was largely unsuitable for underground railways the Southern Railway faced little competition from underground lines, encouraging a denser railway network.

=== Key locations ===
The headquarters of the Southern was in the former LSWR offices at [[Waterloo station]]. Locomotives were constructed and maintained at works inherited from its constituent companies at Eastleigh, Ashford and Brighton. The largest was at Eastleigh, which was built by the LSWR in 1909 to replace the cramped Nine Elms locomotive works in South London. Brighton works had been constructing locomotives since 1840 for the LBSCR, and was responsible for turning out 104 of 110 Bulleid Light Pacifics between 1945 and 1951. Finally, Ashford was inherited from the SECR, and had been built in 1847, and was the works responsible for introducing the Q1 class. Ashford constructed its final locomotive in March 1944, a War Department contract for Stanier 8F 2-8-0 number 8764.

Carriage and wagon works had also also been inherited at Eastleigh, along with Lancing carriage works, which had been built in 1888 on the former LBSCR system.  During the Second World War, both works were turned over to wartime production such as Horsa and Hamilcar gliders. Freight workshops were located at Ashford and Eastleigh. A concrete works was located near [[Exmouth Junction]] locomotive shed, and this was responsible for platform seat fittings, pre-cast concrete fencing and station lamp posts.

=== Engineering ===
The [[South Western Main Line]] of the former LSWR between London and Southampton was completed by [[Joseph Locke]] with easy gradients, leading to several cuttings, tunnels and embankments across the [[River Loddon|Loddon]], [[River Test|Test]] and [[River Itchen|Itchen]] Valleys, with brick arches constructed across South London to the site of Waterloo station. Such was the emphasis placed upon minimising gradients that the stretch between [[Micheldever]] and [[Winchester]] has the longest constant gradient of any British main line. Tunnels and viaducts were also common features in the south-east, with several examples to be found on the former LBSCR and SECR netwroks, the most famous being the Shakespeare Cliff and Clayton tunnels.

== Operations ==
The running of the Southern was undertaken by the Board of Directors, the first Chairman of which was Sir Hugh Drummond, who was appointed in 1923.  There were originally three general managers: [[Herbert Ashcombe Walker|Sir Herbert Walker]], Percy Tempest and William Forbes, although Walker was the sole occupant in the post within a year.<ref name=bonavia>Bonavia, 28</ref> The position of Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway was given to a former employee of the SECR, [[Richard Maunsell]]. For ease of administration, the lines inherited in 1923 were divided into three geographical sections with a Traffic Department for each, loosely based upon the areas covered by the amalgamated companies:

* The Western Section (former LSWR routes) included the [[South Western Main Line]](the oldest part of the Southern network, having been constructed in 1838), the [[West Coastway Line]], and the [[West of England Main Line]], both serving destinations popular with holidaymakers. It stretched into [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and this circuitous route was known derisively as the Southern's "Withered Arm" because the GWR had a greater presence in this region.  
* The Central Section (former LB&SCR routes) included the [[Brighton Main Line]] and the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]].
* The Eastern Section (former SECR routes) included the [[Chatham Main Line]], the [[Hastings Line]], the [[Kent Coast Line]] and the [[North Downs Line]].<ref name=bonavia1> Bonavia, 26</ref>

Both operational and Commercial aspects of the railway were brought under the Traffic Managers, which relieved the General Manager of many tasks, allowing him the opportunity to make policy decisions.<ref name=bonavia2> Bonavia, pp. 27-28</ref> Specialised Superintendents served under the Traffic Manager, breaking down the tasks of operating their respective sections.<ref name=bonavia> Bonavia, 28</ref> As such , the Southern operated a hybrid system of both centralised and decentralised operation. 
  
=== Passenger operations ===
:''See also [[Named trains: UK]]''
Passenger services constituted the key breadwinner of the Southern Railway, and provided the focus for media attention.  This meant that the Southern was to operate a number of famous named trains, which provided another source of publicity for John Elliot.  The Eastern and Central Sections of the network served the Channel ports, whilst the Western Section catered for the heavy summer holiday traffic to the West Country resorts.  Passenger services on the Southern consisted of Pullman luxury dining trains, and normal, everyday passenger services, which gave the railway a high total number of carriages at 10,800.

====Pullman services====
Pullman services were the premier trains of the Southern, reflecting the pride that was felt towards the railway.  These luxury services included several boat trains including the [[Golden Arrow]] (London-Paris, translated as Fl<U+00E8>che d'Or for the French part of its route), The Cunarder (London - Southampton Ocean Liner service) and the [[Night Ferry]] (London - Paris and Brussels).  The Western Section also featured Pullman trains, namely the [[Bournemouth Belle]] and the [[Devon Belle]]. 

The Golden Arrow was the best-known train of the Southern, and was introduced on 15 May 1929.  The train consisted of Pullmans and luggage vans, linking London Victoria to Dover, with transfer to the French equivalent at [[Calais]].  Other Pullman services were also provided, and included the [[Brighton Belle]], which had its origins in 1881 with the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]], which named the service the Southern Belle in 1908.  The train was steam-hauled until 1933 when electric units were introduced after the electrification of the London-Brighton mainline. On [[29 June]] [[1934]] the train was renamed the Brighton Belle and continued until withdrawal in 1972.

====Ordinary services====
The remainder of passenger operations were non-Pullman, and reflected the <U+2018>bread and butter<U+2019> nature of running a passenger railway. West Country services were dominated by lucrative summer holiday traffic and passengers wishing to travel to the Isle of Wight and further afield. In winter months, the western extremity of the Southern network saw very little local usage, as the railway linked sparsely populated communities. Competition with the Great Western Railway also diluted passenger traffic within this area, as it carried passenger to the urban centres of the West Country.  

Passenger services on secondary routes were given motive power that befitted the lacklustre nature of the duty, with elderly locomotives being used to provide a local service that fed into the major mainline stations such as Basingstoke. This was invariably a financial consideration intended to prolong the life of locomotives that would otherwise be scrapped. However in some cases, the route was such that some of the newer classes were precluded from operating because of restrictions in loading gauge, with the [[Lyme Regis]] branch from [[Axminster]] providing an example.

The Southern also operated push-pull trains of up to two carriages in commuter areas. Push-pull operations did not need the time-consuming use of a turntable or run-around at the end of a suburban branch line, and enabled the driver to use a cab in the end coach to drive the locomotive in reverse. Such operations were similar to the "[[GWR Autotrain|autotrains]]", with a Drummond M7 providing the motive power. The electrification of the former LB&SCR and suburban networks around London meant the withdrawal of steam-hauled commuter services. These were replaced by EMUs of varying lengths according to demand, which had the advantage of rapid acceleration and braking.  

Amongst the ordinary services, the Southern also operated famous titled express trains such as the [[Atlantic Coast Express]]. With a large variety of holiday destinations including [[Bude]], [[Exmouth]], [[Ilfracombe railway station|Ilfracombe]], [[Padstow railway station|Padstow]], [[Plymouth]], [[Seaton]], [[Sidmouth]] and [[Torrington]], the 11am "ACE" from Waterloo, as the Atlantic Coast Express became known, was the most multi-portioned train in the UK from its introduction in 1926. This was due to sections of the train splitting at selected junctions for onward journey to their final destinations in the West Country. Padstow railway station in [[Cornwall]] was the westernmost point of the Southern Railway, and marked the end or beginning of the "ACE", which was the longest timetabled journey to be found on the network. 

Once again, the importance of the destination dictated the motive power selected to haul each portion to their final destinations.  Through carriages to East Devon and North Cornwall were invariably hauled by the diminutive Drummond M7 tank locomotives, and from 1952, [[BR standard class 3 tank]]s; the rest of the train continued behind a Bulleid Light Pacific to Plymouth. The final "ACE" was hauled on 5 September 1964 when the Western Section of the former Southern Railway network was absorbed into the [[Western Region of British Railways]].

=== Freight operations ===
Passenger traffic was the main source of revenue for the Southern Railway throughout its existence, although goods were also carried in separate trains. Goods such as milk and cattle from the agricultural areas of the West Country provided a regular source of freight traffic, whilst imports from the south coast ports also required carriage by rail to freight terminals. From these terminals, the freight could be sorted for onward travel to their final destinations.

As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line often limited this. The vacuum brake, which was standard equipment on passenger trains, was gradually fitted to a number of ordinary goods wagons, allowing a number of vacuum "fitted" trains to faster than 40 mph (64 km/h). While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton, as the railway was designated as a common carrier that could not choose what goods it could carry.

=== Ancillary operations ===
The Southern inherited a range of related activities from its constituent companies, which it continued to develop.

====Shipping====
The Southern inherited docks at Southampton, [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], [[Plymouth]], [[Folkestone]], [[Dover]], [[Littlehampton]], [[Whitstable]], [[Strood]], [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], [[Queenborough]], [[Hoo Peninsula|Port Victoria]] and [[Padstow]]. The Southern continued to invest heavily in these facilities, and [[Southampton]] overtook [[Liverpool]] as the country's main port for Trans-Atlantic liners. The Southern inherited 38 large turbine or other steamers and a number of other vessels branded under Channel Packet, the maritime arm of the railway.

====Ships====

The Southern inherited a number of ships from its various constituent companies.

====Hotels====
Ten large hotels were owned by the company, at the London termini and at the coast.

====Road transport====
From 1929 onwards the Southern invested in bus companies providing feeder services to its trains.  The brand names [[Southern National]] (a joint venture with the National Omnibus & Transport Co. Ltd.) and [[Southern Vectis]] have long outlived the railway company itself.<ref name="Who we are">{{cite web|url=http://www.islandbuses.info/about.shtml|title=Southern Vectis - Who we are|publisher=www.islandbuses.info|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>  

====Air transport====
In conjunction with other [[Big Four]] companies the Southern also invested in developing air services, notably to the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Wight]].

==Traction and rolling stock==
===Locomotives===
{{main|Locomotives of the Southern Railway}}
For most of its existence the Southern painted its 2390 locomotives an olive green colour, with plain black frames and wheels. Name and number plates were generally of polished brass with a red background. In later years, the basic livery was changed to Malachite green with bright yellow lettering. Most locomotives were inherited from its constituent companies, but from 1924 a programme of standardisation was begun by Maunsell.

==== Maunsell ====
[[Image:SR 850 Lord Nelson.jpg|thumb|left|Preserved Lord Nelson class 850 ''Lord Nelson''.]]
The first locomotives constructed for the Southern were to designs inherited from the pre-Grouping railway companies, such as the [[LSWR N15 class|N15 class]] and [[LSWR H15 class|H15 class]], both modified by Maunsell from the original design.<ref name=steam1> Clarke: ''Steam World'' (April 2008), p. 50</ref> These were intended to be interim solutions to motive power problems, since several designs in operation on the Southern were obsolescent. The 1920s also proved to be the era of standardisation, with ease of maintenance and repair key considerations in a successful locomotive design.<ref name=Swift1> Swift, p. 9</ref>

In 1926, the first of a new generation of Southern designed and built locomotives emerged from Eastleigh works, the Maunsell [[SR Lord Nelson class|Lord Nelson class]], reputedly the most powerful 4-6-0 in Britain at the time.<ref name=Whitehouse>Whitehouse, & Thomas, p. 47</ref> So successful was the Lord Nelson class that the [[LMS Royal Scot Class|Royal Scot class]] had its origins in the Maunsell design.<ref> Southern E-Group (2004)[http://www.semgonline.com/steam/lnclass_1.html], Retrieved 10 September 2008. For information on influence.</ref> However, the onset of the Depression precluded further strides in Southern locomotive technology, apart from the [[SR V "Schools" class|V "Schools" class]] 4-4-0 and the various electric designs.<ref name=Herring>Herring, pp. 124-125</ref> Maunsell also designed freight locomotives for use in freight yards such as that at [[Feltham]] in south west London, the final example of which was the [[SR Q class|Q class]]. The design of the Q class coincided with Maunsell's ill health, which resulted in a conservative approach to design. The first examples were released in 1937, the year in which Maunsell retired from the CME's position.

==== Bulleid ====
[[image:SR West Country Class 21C123 'Blackmore Vale' at York Railfest.JPG|thumb|Preserved unrebuilt West Country class 21C123 ''Blackmoor Vale''.]]
Maunsell was succeeded in 1937 by Oliver Vaughan Snell Bulleid, who brought with him experience gained under [[Sir Nigel Gresley]] at the LNER.  He designed the [[Bulleid chain-driven valve gear]] that was compact enough to fit within the restrictions of his ''Pacific'' designs, the [[SR Merchant Navy Class|Merchant Navy class]] of 1941, and the [[SR West Country and Battle of Britain Classes|''Light Pacific'']] design of 1945. Ever the innovator, Bulleid introduced welded steel boilers and steel [[firebox]]es which were easier to repair than the predominant copper varieties, whilst a new emphasis on cab ergonomics was followed.<ref name=BiR>''Bulleids in Retrospect''</ref> Established locomotive design practices were radically altered in his designs, with the wheels changed from spoked to the [[boxpok]] design, which gave better all-round support to the tyre.<ref name=Creer> Creer & Morrison, p. 21 </ref> 

Bulleid advocated a continental style of numbering, basing this upon his experiences at the French branch of [[Westinghouse Electric]] before the [[First World War]], and his tenure in the rail operating department during that conflict. The Southern Railway number adapted the [[UIC classification]] system where "2" and "1" refer to the number of un-powered leading and trailing axles respectively, and "A", "B" and "C" refers to the number of driving axles. As an example, the first Merchant Navy class locomotive was numbered 21C1.<ref name=Burridge3>Burridge, p. 60</ref>

Visually, the most unusual of his designs was a small, heavy freight locomotive, the most powerful 0-6-0 ever to operate in Britain.<ref name=Herring /> This [[SR Q1 class|Q1 class]] was designed to eliminate anything that might be considered unnecessary in locomotive design including such traditional items as wheel splashers.<ref name=Herring> Herring, p. 150-151</ref> With innovative lagging material that dictated the form of the boiler cladding, the Q1 was regarded by many as the ugliest locomotive ever to appear.<ref name=Morgan> Morgan, pp. 17-19</ref> The forty engines produced required only the same amount of materials that would be needed for just thirty-eight more conventional machines, justifying the economies and design.<ref name=Morgan1> Morgan, p. 19</ref>

Bulleid's innovation stemmed from a belief in the continued development potential of steam traction, and culminated in the [[SR Leader Class|Leader class]] of 1946, an 0-6-6-0 design that had two cabs, negating the use of a turntable.<ref name=Bulleid> Bulleid, Section "Leader class"</ref>  The entire locomotive was placed on two bogies, enabling negotiation around tight curves, whilst the slab-sided body could use a labour-saving carriage washer.<ref name=Haresnape>Haresnape, Section 4</ref>

Despite the successes of the ''Pacifics'' and the unusual 0-6-0 Q1 freight locomotive, the ''Pacifics'' were difficult to maintain and harboured enough eccentricities to justify their rebuilding in the mid-1950s. Bulleid also designed several electric and diesel-electric locomotives, continuing to push back the boundaries of contemporary locomotive design and established practice. The innovations ensured that the Southern was once again leading the field in locomotive design, and earned Bulleid the title "last giant of steam".<ref name=Day-Lewis> Day-Lewis, p. 7</ref>

==== Electric stock and locomotives ====

With the completion of the 660 V DC third rail conversion, investment was made in modernising the electrical locomotive and rolling stock fleet. The early AC overhead electric multiple unit types were referred to by a two-letter code, which was then adapted for the DC third-rail system, with designs coming from both Southern CMEs and their electrical engineers. The classification system meant that the unit type was given a three-letter code (sometimes two letters), prefixed by the number of carriages within each unit, e.g. '''4SUB''' for a 4-car ''sub''urban set, constructed between 1925 and 1937. Another example was the series of '''2Bil''' units (2-car ''Bi-L''avatory stock) constructed from 1938, which were so-called because each set had two lavatories, one in each car. The electric stock consisted of a fixed formation of two driving units at both ends of the train, and could have varying numbers of carriages in between, as indicated in the classification system. Variants of the Southern's electric stock included Pullman carriages or wagons for the carriage of parcels and newspapers, allowing flexibility of use on the London suburban lines and the Eastern Section of the railway network.

The Southern Railway also built two mainline electric locomotives, numbered CC1 and CC2 under Bulleid's numbering system. These were renumbered 20001 and 20002 after nationalisation, when a third locomotive to this design, number 20003, was built in 1948. The locomotives were later classified as [[British Rail Class 70]]. These incorporated a cab design similar to that of the [[British Rail Class 402|2HAL]] (2-car ''Ha''lf ''L''avatory electric stock) design constructed from 1938 onwards. This was due to ease of construction by welding, which allowed both cheap and speedy construction. With the outbreak of war in 1939, most new locomotive construction projects were put on hold in favour of the war effort, although construction of CC1 and CC2 was exempted from this because of promised savings in labour and fuel over steam locomotives.

===Carriages===
[[Image:100 3282 (Small).JPG|thumb|right|A rake of preserved Maunsell carriages on the Bluebell Railway. Note that there is no carriage set number painted on the brake coach.]]
The Southern inherited many wooden-bodied carriage designs from its constituent companies. However, once again there was an emphasis on standardisation of the coaching stock, which led to Maunsell designing new carriages. These were classified between 0 and 4, so that an 8' 0<U+00BE>" wide carriage was "Restriction 0". These restrictions related to the Southern's composite [[loading gauge]], so that some more restricted routes could be catered for. The new carriages comprised First and Third Class compartments, each of which contained a corridor and doors for each compartment, enabling quick egress on commuter services. Similar design principles were also applied to the electric train sets, whereby quick passenger egress ensured a punctual service.

The Southern Railway was one of the few railways to marshal its carriages in fixed numbered sets. This made maintenance easier, as the location of a particular train set would always be known through its number, which was painted on the ends of the set. A pool of individual "loose" carriages was also kept for train strengthening on summer Saturdays and to replace faulty stock.

The second phase of carriage construction began towards the end of the Southern's existence. Bulleid had vast experience in carriage design from his time with the LNER, and he applied this acquired knowledge to a new fleet of carriages (see picture). Some of his more unusual projects were his "Tavern Car" designs; these were carriages that were to represent a typical country [[tavern]], with a bar and seating space provided within the carriage. The outside of the "Tavern Cars" were partially painted in a mock-Tudor style of architecture, and were given typical public house names. Poor ventilation from small windows made the "Tavern Cars" unpopular amongst the travelling public, with several being converted to ordinary use during the 1950s.

The Southern was the only major British railway company not to operate sleeping cars apart from those brought in from the continent on the 'Night Train', as distances on the railway meant that such provision was not financially viable. However, another unusual project was to address the issue of overcrowding on suburban services. The answer to this problem was [[SR Class 4DD|Britain's first double-deck carriages]]. Two sets were completed and saw use until the 1970s, but further orders were not placed due to the cramped conditions inside the carriages that were dictated by the restrictions of the loading gauge.

===Wagons===
Throughout the existence of the Southern its wagons were painted a dark brown colour. Most wagons were four-wheeled with "SR" in white, although six-wheeled milk tankers were frequently seen on the South Western Main Line to and from [[United Dairies]] in London. As the railway was primarily passenger relatively little in the way of investment in freight wagons was made except for general utility vans, which could be used for both freight and luggage, especially on boat trains. These consisted of bogie and four wheel designs. At its peak, the Southern owned 37,500 freight wagons, a small number when one considers 500,000 private owner wagons from collieries were brought under the control of the Railway Executive Committee during the Second World War.

== Cultural impact ==

The Southern was particularly successful at promoting itself to the public. The downgrading of the Mid-Sussex line via [[Horsham]] that served Portsmouth was met with hostility by the general public, causing a public relations disaster.<ref name=Whitehouse3>Whitehouse, & Thomas, p. 18</ref> This episode stimulated the creation of the first "modern" public relations department with the appointment of [[John Elliot (railway manager)|John Elliot]] (later Sir John Elliot) in 1925. Elliot was instrumental in creating the positive image that the Southern enjoyed prior to the Second World War, building a publicity campign for its modernisation programmes, especially as regards the electrification project, marketed as the "World's Greatest Suburban Electric".<ref name=Whitehouse1 /> 

=== Tourism ===
The positive image of progress was enhanced by the promotion of the south and south-west as holiday destinations. "Sunny South Sam" became a character fixed firmly in the public mind as embodying the service of the railway, whilst slogans such as "Live in [[Kent]] and be content" encouraged commuters to move out from [[London]] and patronise the Southern's services.<ref name=Whitehouse2>Whitehouse, & Thomas, p. 114</ref> Posters were also introduced to advertise ocean services from Ocean Terminal in Southampton and the docks at Dover. These posters also incorporated the corresponding rail connections with London, such as "The Cunarder" and the "Golden Arrow".<ref name=Whitehouse1>Whitehouse, & Thomas, p. 115</ref>  

=== Heritage ===
The Southern's memory lives on at several [[Heritage railways|preserved]] railways, including the [[Watercress Line]], [[Swanage Railway]], [[Spa Valley Railway]], and [[Bluebell Railway]]. Other remnants of the railway include Eastleigh works and the London termini, including Waterloo (the largest London railway station), [[Victoria station (London)|Victoria]], [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]], [[Cannon Street station|Cannon Street]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] (the oldest London terminus).  There are also several societies that specialise in all things Southern, including the Southern Railways Group and the Southern Electric Group.  Both of these help to promote continued interest in the Southern Railway and have regular newsletters.

== Notable people ==
===General Managers===
'''Sir [[Herbert Ashcombe Walker]], KCB''' General Manager (1923-1937). Walker was an astute administrator of railways, having gained experience as General Manager of the LSWR from 1912. After retiring in 1937 he was a director of the Southern until the end of its existence in 1947. Three significant events occurred under Walker's tenure as General Manager: the rebuilding of Waterloo station, completed in 1922; electrification in mid-1920s; and the appointment of Bulleid as CME in 1937.

'''[[Gilbert S. Szlumper]], TD, CBE''' General Manager (1937<U+2013>1939). Trained as a [[civil engineer]] and became Docks and Marine Manager at Southampton, before becoming Assistant General Manager in 1925. In 1939 he was recalled by the War Office as a [[Major-General]] to sort out the military movements at Southampton Docks. He was ousted from the General Managership, after the Traffic Manager, Eustace Missenden, refused to become ''Acting'' General Manager, and threatened to resign if not confirmed as GM proper.

'''[[Sir Eustace Missenden]]''' General Manager (1939<U+2013>Nationalisation); Chairman, Railway Executive (1947<U+2013>1951). Missenden had been Traffic Manager before becoming the GM in 1939. From the latter half of 1947, he was largely absent from the Southern Railway as Chairman of the Railway Executive.

'''[[John Elliot (railway manager)|Sir John Elliot]]''' Acting General Manager (1947); Assistant General Manager (1933 to nationalisation); Public Relations Assistant (1925 until 1933).  Noted for being Britain's first expert in public relations, Elliot was brought in by Sir Herbert Walker after the bad press received following service delays and consolidation of the newly created company.  It was at the suggestion of Elliot that the Southern's express passenger locomotives should be named, representing positive publicity for the railway, whilst distinctive locomotive liveries and well-known posters were created under his direction. He continued to serve the railways after nationalisation in 1948, and was created Chairman of [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] in 1953.

===Chief Mechanical Engineers===
'''[[Richard Edward Lloyd Maunsell|R. E. L. Maunsell]]''', the Southern's first [[Chief Mechanical Engineer]] (1922 to 1937). Maunsell was responsible for initial attempts at locomotive standardisation on the Southern, as well as overseeing the introduction of electric traction. Among his many achievements was the introduction of the 4-6-0 [[SR Lord Nelson Class]] locomotives and also the [[SR Class V]] or "Schools" class, which were the ultimate and very successful development of the British [[4-4-0]] express passenger type. He also introduced new, standardised rolling stock designs for use on the Southern network, which were based upon the railway's composite [[loading gauge]].

'''[[O. V. S. Bulleid]]''' (CME 1937 to nationalisation). Bulleid moved to the Southern from the [[LNER]], bringing several ideas for improving the efficiency of steam locomotives. Such innovations were used on the [[SR Merchant Navy Class|Merchant Navy class]], [[SR West Country Class|West Country and Battle of Britain classes]] ("Bulleid Light Pacifics"), [[SR Class Q1|Q1]] and experimental [[SR Leader Class|Leader]] designs. He also developed a host of innovative electric units and locomotives.
