'''Talladega Superspeedway''' is a [[motorsport]]s complex located in [[Talladega, Alabama]].
It was constructed in the [[1960s]] in place of abandoned  [[airport]] [[runway]]s by [[International Speedway Corporation]], a business controlled by [[NASCAR]]'s founding France family along with [[Daytona International Speedway]] and several other [[racetrack]]s.  At 2.66 miles (4.28&nbsp;km) long, Talladega is the largest oval track in the [[Nextel Cup]] Series and has seating provisions for over 175,000 patrons. 

The start/finish line is placed after the pit exit because Bill France wanted to have higher ticket sales towards that side, as well as centered with pit road. The unusual placement has affected the outcome of several races (the start/finish line is normally placed across from the center of pit road). The track is adjacent to and visible from [[Interstate 20]].

The [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] is adjacent to the Talladega Superspeedway.

==History==
In the early days of NASCAR, a one-mile, oval track was originally planned to be built in [[Hillsborough, North Carolina]].  Local religious leaders opposed the construction of such a large track, and NASCAR founder [[William France Sr.|Bill France]] decided to instead build the track in Alabama at Talladega.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historichillsborough.org/images/Speedway-Complete.pdf|title= Racing vs. Religion|accessdate=2007-07-16 |publisher= Historic Hillsborough}}</ref>

Talladega got off to a controversial start when the Professional Drivers Association, a union of drivers led by [[Richard Petty]], went on strike the night before the inaugural Talladega 500. The union was concerned with the speed which could be attained due to the track's length and steep banking, and the perceived threat to driver safety that this posed. Bill France took to the track himself in a car and drove around it at high speeds. NASCAR also ran a successful support race, but it was not enough, and the PDA drivers went on strike.  Replacement drivers from the previous day's race were asked to race, and tickets were good for future races. The race was the only win for [[Richard Brickhouse]] and was the debut race for six-time championship team owner [[Richard Childress]]. 

==Restrictor Plates and "The Big One"==
Speeds well in excess of 200 mph (320&nbsp;km/h) were commonplace at Talladega. Talladega Superspeedway has the record for the fastest recorded time in a closed oval course, with the record of 216.309 mph set by [[Rusty Wallace]] on [[June 9]], [[2004]].<ref>http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/cup/06/10/rwallace_talladega/index.html Accessed July 4, 2007.</ref>. Wallace circled the 2.66-mile (4.28-km) trioval in 44.270 seconds, which surpassed the previous record held by [[Bill Elliott]] (212.809 mph) set in [[1987]], but doesn't replace the record due to the fact it was practice. [[Buddy Baker]] was the first driver to qualify at a speed over 200 mph, with a 200.447 mph lap during qualifying on [[March 24]], [[1970]]. Baker was also the first recorded driver to break the 200 mph barrier at the track, with a speed of 200.096 mph in a test session. A rarely known fact on Buddy Baker's record is that he was the first to tell NASCAR that he broke it and he was timed on his lap. Bobby Allison went out before him and turned over the 200 barrier but thought that could get them in trouble so the team ignored it, but minutes later they saw a NASCAR record was something they ignored. (Source "Bobby Allison Saga Book")

In 1987 [[Bobby Allison]] experienced a tire failure while going through the "trioval" portion of the track, which sent his car airborne. His car tore out a portion of the frontstretch catch fence, nearly entering the crowd. NASCAR imposed rule changes to slow the cars after the incident, with a 1988 rule requiring cars running there and at Daytona to use [[restrictor plate]]s. The most often cited reason is a fear that the increasing speeds were exceeding the capabilities of the tires available at the time, as high-speed tire failure had led to some gruesome crashes at slightly lower speeds. The plates limit the amount of air and fuel entering the intake manifolds of the car, greatly reducing the power of the cars and hence their speed. This has led to the style of racing held at Talladega and Daytona to be somewhat different from that at other [[superspeedway]]s and to be referred to by NASCAR fans as "''restrictor-plate racing''".  

The reduced power affects not only the maximum speed reached by the cars but the time it takes them to achieve their full speed as well, which can be nearly one full circuit of the track. The racing seen at Talladega today is extremely tight; often in rows of three or four cars, and sometimes even 5 wide on the straightaways throughout most of the field, as the track is wide enough to permit such racing. 

Such close quarters due to the cars being so close to each other, however, makes it extremely difficult for a driver to avoid an incident as it is unfolding in front of him, and the slightest mistake often leads to massive (and often frightening) multi-car accidents - dubbed "[[the Big One]]" by fans and drivers - and Talladega is notorious for such, and always has been. It is not uncommon to see 20 or more cars collected in them. Such huge crashes are less frequent at Daytona, which is a more handling oriented track.

The danger of "The Big One" not only can cause extensive damage to cars during a race, but it can affect points standings overall, especially since the second race was moved from July to October because of Alabama heat, and the development of NASCAR's playoff system that incorporates the second race, currently the [[UAW-Ford 500]], although such big wrecks occasionally occurred even before the restrictor plates were introduced as well.

==Talladega facelift==
[[Image:Talladega Before the Race.jpg|left|275px|Before the start of a race.]]Talladega Superspeedway went under heavy re-construction on the pavement of the racing surface and down on apron (trouble lane). Construction began on May 1, 2006 and ended September 18, 2006. The first NASCAR race (Not Touring Race) after the face-lift was the John Deere 250, NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series on October 7th. [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] qualified on the pole for the race, and turned out to be the winner in the end after the hard crash on the last lap in turn 3 involving [[Mike Wallace]] in the GEICO Chevrolet and [[Derrike Cope]] in the Key Motorsports Chevrolet.

==Scheduled races==
Talladega hosts two [[Sprint Cup]] races and one [[Nationwide Series]] race annually. Both of the Sprint Cup races are 500.08 miles (188 laps) (800&nbsp;km) in length. The names by which the races are called now vary due to the purchase of [[naming rights]], with the spring Nextel Cup race since spring 2002 ([[2002 in sports|2002]]) being referred to as the ''[[Aaron's]] 499'' after the Atlanta-based rent-to-own chain.  The Nationwide Series race has historically been a 500 kilometer race (117 laps) since its 1992 inception, but was cut to 300 miles (483 km - 113 laps) in 1998 because of a spectator's letter questioning the metric distance, but restored to 500 kilometers by its current sponsor.  The Craftsman Truck Series race is 250 miles (94 laps) and the ARCA race, once a 500 kilometer affair, was shortened to 300 miles in 1998, and to 250 miles in 2006 when it was moved to Friday.

The Aaron's 499, then sponsored by Winston, was known as one of the sport's four legs of the traditional "[[Winston Million]]", with the [[Daytona 500]], [[Coca-Cola 600]], and the [[Southern 500]] being the other three. With the demise of the Southern 500 by a lawsuit, there are only three majors remaining. (From 1985 until 1997, a driver who won three of the four majors won a one million dollar bonus.)

In Summer 2006, Talladega Superspeedway was repaved.

==Records==
*[[March 24]], [[1970]]:  During qualifying, Buddy Baker becomes the first RECORDED driver in NASCAR history to break the 200 mph barrier by turning a lap of 200.447 mph (322.588&nbsp;km/h).
*[[August 20]], [[1971]]: Paula Murphy, "Miss STP" made a record closed course run for a female at 171.499 mph (276.001&nbsp;km/h).
*August, [[1974]]: [[A.J. Foyt]] tests an Indy car at a speed of over 217 mph (349&nbsp;km/h).
*[[August 9]], [[1975]]: [[Mark Donohue]] sets a closed-course world record in a [[Porsche 917|Porsche 917-30]] at 221.160 mph. It would stand as a world record for four years, and as a United States record until 1986.
*[[1984]]: The [[Winston 500]] set a still standing [[NASCAR]] record with 75 lead changes in a single race.
*[[May 5]], [[1985]]: [[Bill Elliott]] sets a 500-mile race record, winning the [[Winston 500]] at an average speed of 186.288 mph.  Elliott won the race despite losing nearly two laps during a lengthy early pit stop to fix a broken oil line, and despite the race only having two caution flags.  Elliott made up the entire distance he lost under one lengthy, green-flag period.  The record stood as the fastest 500-mile race of any kind until [[1990]], when [[Al Unser, Jr.]] broke it by winning the [[Champ Car|CART]] [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan 500]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]] at an average speed of 189.727 mph (305.336&nbsp;km/h).  [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] later broke the record for fastest 500-mile [[NASCAR]] race (see below).
*[[November 26]], [[1985]]: [[Lyn St. James]] sets a record closed course run for a female, at over 200 mph (320&nbsp;km/h).
*[[March 24]], [[1986]]: [[Bobby Unser]] sets a closed-course speed record for four-wheel drive vehicles with an [[Audi]] 5000CS Turbo Quattro at 206.825 mph (332.853&nbsp;km/h).
*[[1986]]: The [[Saab Long Run]] - set of 2 world and 21 international records with three series [[Saab 9000|SAAB 9000 Turbo]] - 100,000&nbsp;km with an average speed of 213.299&nbsp;km/h and 50,000 miles with an average speed of 213.686&nbsp;km/h.
[[Image:Bill Elliott 200 mph.jpg|thumb|310px|Bill Elliott's car that set the record for the fastest qualifying speed in a stock car - 212.809 mph (342.483 km/h)]]
*[[May 1]], [[1987]]: Bill Elliott sets the all-time [[NASCAR]] qualifying record, winning the pole for the [[Winston 500]] at a speed of 212.809 mph (342.483&nbsp;km/h) (44.998 seconds).  The record still stands due strictly to the use of the [[carburetor]] [[restrictor plate]], mandated after the [[1987]] season.
*[[October 11]], [[1988]]:  Lyn St. James sets a record closed course run for a female at 212.577 mph (342.110&nbsp;km/h), driving a Ford Thunderbird.

*[[May 10]], [[1997]]:  Mark Martin wins the Winston Select 500, a race which had no caution flags, at a NASCAR 500-mile record speed of 188.354 mph (303.126&nbsp;km/h), nearly ten years after the introduction of restrictor plates.
*[[June 10]], [[2004]]: [[Rusty Wallace]] tests a stock car without a restrictor plate for series sponsor Nextel to test communication capabilities, and hits a speed over 228 mph (367&nbsp;km/h) on the straights (some reports say the speeds were close to 235 mph / 378&nbsp;km/h), and 221 mph (356&nbsp;km/h) average speed for the lap.

==Memorable races at Talladega==
{{main|Memorable races at Talladega}}
*[[2005]]: [[Jeff Gordon]] won his second straight [[Aaron's 499]] under the [[Green-white-checker finish|green-white-checker]] rule stretching the race to 516 miles, and won despite a 25-car wreck (the third largest in the modern era) brought out the red flag on Lap 132, in which started Dale Earnhardt Jr. spun Mike Wallace causing a chain reaction pile-up in Turn 1.
*[[2006]] (Spring): [[Jimmie Johnson]] held off [[Tony Stewart]] and [[Brian Vickers]] at the Aaron's 499 on [[May 1]], 2006 (the race had been delayed from Sunday to Monday).  When he stepped out of the car, Dick Berggren (FOX pit reporter) told him he was an uncle of new born Connor Johnson. Several drivers were blamed for causing two multi-car crashes in the race.  Johnson also became the eighth driver to win all four legs of NASCAR's Grand Slam in his career.
*2006 (Fall): [[Brian Vickers]] wins under caution after bumping the car of teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] into the car of [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] during a last lap pass on the backstretch at the [[UAW-Ford 500]] on [[October 8]], [[2006]]. In a repeat of the [[2004]] [[Aaron's 499]], the fans expressed their disapproval of Junior not winning by tossing debris onto the track.
*[[2007]]: [[Kyle Busch]] goes for a terrifying tumble into the 3rd turn during the spring Busch Series race, after making contact with Tony Stewart.  Numerous other cars are involved in other small wrecks during the race that whittled the field down.  Jeff Gordon wins the spring Cup race the next day, and, like the 2004 race, a few fans litter the track in debris (especially beer cans) in protest of Gordon passing [[Dale Earnhardt]] in career wins. Gordon won the fall race in the same year in the first ever COT restrictor plate race by passing teammate Jimmie Johnson and fellow competitor Tony stewart to lead from the entrance of turn 3 to the finish line on the last lap with Johnson coming up short on a late pass attempt. This also marked a milestone as it was Gordon's 80th career win and a personal achievement as it was .
*2007 (Fall): [[Jeff Gordon]] had a pit-road penalty for taking pit equipment from his stall earlier in the race, went to the back, but made a charge to the front late in the race and on the final lap, he was running second behind teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] until [[Tony Stewart]] led a group of cars on the outside, heading down the backstretch, Gordon went up in front of Stewart which gave him a draft push by Johnson and into the lead and helm him, Stewart and [[Dave Blaney]] off for the win. This was Gordon's 80th career win, 6th at Talladega and 12th restrictor-plate win, passing [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the most restrictor-plate wins, he also sweeps the races at Talladega for 2007, becoming the 6th person to sweeps both races at Talladega on the same year and wins the first [[Car of Tomorrow]] race on a Superspeedway. Gordon won the race with a special [[Pepsi]] paint scheme designed by a fan, quoting after he won that "they should do this again next year.", this is Gordon's 3rd win at Talladega with a Pepsi paint scheme. [[Toyota]] was the spotlight of the weekend, celebrating its first pole on a Superspeedway courtesy of [[Michael Waltrip]], five Toyotas in the top 6 starting spots, and drivers in outside the Top 35 in owners points qualifying unusually well.  The Big One also happened in the race, involving 11 cars. Also the first appearance in victory lane by his new daughter Ella
