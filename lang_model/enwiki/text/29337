'''Ivar Giaever''' (originally spelled ''Gi<U+00E6>ver'') (born April 5, 1929 in [[Bergen, Norway]]) is a physicist who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1973 with [[Leo Esaki]] and [[Brian David Josephson|Brian Josephson]] "for their discoveries regarding [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling phenomena]] in [[solid-state physics|solids]]".<ref name="Nobelpressrelease">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/press.html Nobel prize press release]</ref> Giaever's share of the prize was specifically for his "experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in... [[Superconductivity|superconductors]]".<ref name="Nobelcitation">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/index.html Nobel citation]</ref> Giaever is an institute professor emeritus at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], a professor-at-large at the [[University of Oslo]], and the president of Applied Biophysics.<ref name="homepage">[http://www.rpi.edu/~giaevi/ Ivar Giaever's home page at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]</ref>

Giaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|Norwegian Institute of Technology]] in 1952. In 1954 he emigrated from Norway to [[Canada]], where he was employed by the Canadian division of [[General Electric]].  He moved to the [[United States]] two years later, joining General Electric's Research and Development Center at Schenectady, New York in 1958.  He has lived in Niskayuna, New York since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964.  While working for General Electric, Giaever earned a Ph.D. from the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1964.<ref name="nobelbio">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/giaever-bio.html Biography on the Nobel Foundation website]</ref>

The work which led to Giaever's Nobel Prize was performed at General Electric in 1960. Following on from Esaki's discovery of [[electron]] tunnelling in [[semiconductor]]s in 1958, Giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors, demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of oxide surrounded on both sides by metal in a superconducting or normal state. Giaever's experiments demonstrated the existance of an energy gap in superconductors, one of the most important predictions of the [[BCS theory]] of superconductivity that had been developed in 1957.<ref>[[John Bardeen|Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper|Cooper]] and [[John Robert Schrieffer|Schrieffer]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] in 1972.</ref>  Giaever's experimental demonstration of tunnelling in superconductors stimulated the theoretical physicist Brian Josephson to work on the phenomenon, leading to his prediction of the [[Josephson effect]] in 1962.  Esaki and Giaever shared half of the 1973 Nobel Prize, and Josephson received the other half.<ref name="Nobelpressrelease" />

Giaever's research later in his career career was mainly in the field of [[biophysics]].  In 1969, he researched biophysics for a year at [[Cambridge University]], [[England]] through a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he continued to work in this area after he returned to the US.<ref name="nobelbio" />

In addition to the Nobel Prize, he has also been awarded the [[Buckley Prize|Oliver E. Buckley Prize]] by the [[American Physical Society]] in 1965, and the [[Zworykin Award]] by the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1974.<ref name="homepage" /> Giaever is an enthusiastic global warming skeptic, as revealed in a 2008 meeting of Nobel prize winners in Lindau, Germany.[http://nobellaureate.feedroom.com/index.jsp?auto_band=x&rf=sv&fr_story=1599eacaa33f706ce2ae9fbd7a0f7f9068ac9ef0&skin=showcase]
