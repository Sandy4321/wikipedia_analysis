A '''music video''' is a [[short film]] or [[video]] that accompanies a complete piece of music, most commonly a [[song]]. Modern music videos are  primarily made and used as a [[marketing]] device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the origins of music videos go back much further, they came into their own in the [[1980s]], when [[MTV]] (Music Television)'s format was based around them.

Music videos are often called '''promo videos''' or simply '''promos''', due to the fact that they are usually promotional devices. Sometimes, music videos are termed '''short-form music videos''' to distinguish them from full length movies pertaining to music. In the 1980s, the term '''"rock video"''' was often used to describe this form of entertainment, although the term has fallen into disuse.

Music videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking, including [[animation]], [[live action]] films, [[documentary film|documentaries]], and non-narrative, [[abstract film]].

==History of music videos==
===Early precedents===
In [[1910]] [[Alexander Scriabin]] wrote his [[symphony]] ''Prometheus -- Poem of Fire'' for orchestra and "[[light organ]]". And as far back as the [[1920s]], the animated films of [[Oskar Fischinger]] (aptly labelled "visual music") were supplied with orchestral scores. Fischinger also made short animated films to advertise Electrola Records' new releases, making these films possibly the first music videos.

In [[1929]] the [[Russia|Russian]] film revolutionary [[Dziga Vertov]] made a 40 minute film called ''[[Man with the Movie Camera]]''. It was an experiment on filming real, actual events, contrary to [[Georges M<U+00E9>li<U+00E8>s]] theatrical approach. The film is entirely backed by music (played live by an orchestra on theaters) and has no dialogue at all. It's notable for the use of fast editing and fast frame frequencies, which were all synched to the music in order to create an emotion on the viewer. The film is highly regarded for setting the principles of the [[documentary film|documentary]] genre, but it is also important in all [[filmmaking]]. 

[[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s [[1938]] film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'', which features extended scenes of battles choreographed to a score by [[Sergei Prokofiev]], was influenced by Vertov's work and it set new standards for the use of music in film and has been described as the first music video.

Animation pioneer [[Max Fleischer]] introduced a series of sing-along short cartoons called ''[[Screen Songs]]'', which invited audiences to sing along to popular songs by "following the bouncing ball". Early [[1930s]] entries in the series featured popular musicians performing their hit songs on-camera in live-action segments during the [[cartoons]].

The early animated efforts of [[Walt Disney]], his ''[[Silly Symphony|Silly Symphonies]]'', were built around music. The [[Warner Brothers]] cartoons, even today billed as ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'', were initially fashioned around specific songs from upcoming Warner Brothers [[musical film]]s. Live action musical shorts, featuring such popular performers as [[Cab Calloway]], were also distributed to theatres.

[[Blues]] singer [[Bessie Smith]] appeared in a two-reel short film called ''[[Saint Louis Blues (movie)|Saint Louis Blues]]'' ([[1929]]) featuring a dramatized performance of the hit song. It was shown in theatres until 1932. Numerous other musicians appeared in short musical subjects during this period. Later, in the mid-1940s, musician [[Louis Jordan]] made short films for his songs, some of which were spliced together into a bizarre feature film ''[[Lookout Sister]]''; these films were, according to music historian Donald Clarke, the ancestors of music videos <ref>Clarke, pg. 39</ref>.

Another early form of music video were one-song films called "Soundies" made in the [[1940s]] for the [[Panoram]] visual [[jukebox]]. These were short films of musical selections, usually just a band on a movie-set bandstand, made for playing. Thousands of Soundies were made, mostly of [[jazz]] musicians, but also torch singers, comedians, and dancers.

Before the Soundie, even dramatic movies typically had a musical interval, but the Soundie made the music the star and virtually all the name jazz performers appeared in Soundie shorts, many still available on compilation video tapes or DVDs. 

The Panoram jukebox with eight three-minute Soundies were popular in taverns and night spots, but the fad faded during [[World War II]].

In [[1940]], [[Walt Disney]] released ''[[Fantasia (movie)|Fantasia]]'', an animated film based around famous pieces of [[european classical music|classical music]].

=== Film and video promos ===
In [[1956]] [[Tony Bennett]] was filmed walking along [[Serpentine (lake)|The Serpentine]] in [[Hyde Park, London]] as his recording of "[[Stranger in Paradise]]" played; this film was distributed to and played by UK and US television stations, leading Bennett to later claim he made the first music video.

According to the [[Internet Accuracy Project]], [[disk jockey]]-singer [[J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson]] (d. 1959) was the first to coin the phrase "rock video" [http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Richardson,J.P.TheBigBopper.html]

Around [[1960]] the [[Scopitone]], a visual jukebox, was invented in France and short films were produced by many French artists, such as [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Fran<U+00E7>oise Hardy]] and [[Jacques Dutronc]] to accompany their songs. Its use spread to other countries and similar machines such as the Cinebox in Italy and Color-Sonic in the USA were patented. [http://juke-box.dk/gert-design52-77.htm]

In [[1961]] [[Ozzie Nelson]] directed and edited the video of "Travelin' Man" by his son [[Ricky Nelson]]. It featured images of various parts of the world mentioned in the Jerry Fuller song and Ricky singing. It is believed to be the very first rock video.  Ricky also had a regular music slot on the family television show which played a great part in publicizing his career.

The pioneering full-colour music video for [[The Exciters]]' "Tell Him" from 1962 greatly influenced all that came afterwards.

In 1964, [[Kenneth Anger]]'s influential underground experimental short film [[Scorpio Rising]] pioneered the concept of using popular songs for ironic moments and images.

The defining work in the development of the modern music video was [[The Beatles]]' first major motion picture, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (movie)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' in [[1964 in music|1964]], directed by [[Richard Lester]]. The musical segments in this film arguably set out the basic visual vocabulary of today's music videos, influencing a vast number of contemporary musicians, and countless subsequent pop and rock group music videos.

That same year, The Beatles began filming short promotional films for their songs which were distributed for broadcast on television variety shows in other countries, primarily the [[U.S.A.]] (At the same time, [[The Byrds]] began using the same strategy to promote their singles in the [[United Kingdom]], starting with the [[1965]] single "Set You Free This Time".) By the time The Beatles stopped touring in late [[1966]] their promotional films, like their recordings, were becoming increasingly sophisticated, and they now used these films to, in effect, tour for them.

Also in [[1966]] the clip of [[Bob Dylan]] performing "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]" filmed by [[D A Pennebaker]] was much used. The clip's ironic portrayal of a performance and the seemingly random inclusion of a celebrity ([[Allen Ginsberg]]) in a non-performing role also became mainstays of the form. The clip has been much imitated.

Although unashamedly based on ''A Hard Day's Night'', the hugely popular American TV series ''[[The Monkees]]'' was another important influence on the development of the music video genre, with each episode including a number of specially-made film segments that were created to accompany the various Monkees songs used in the series. The series ran from [[1966]] to [[1968]].

The Beatles took the genre to new heights with their groundbreaking films for "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" and "[[Penny Lane]]", made in early [[1967 in music|1967]], which used techniques borrowed from underground and avant garde film, such as reversed film effects, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles and rhythmic editing. Created at the height of the [[psychedelic music]] period, these two landmark films are among the very first purpose-made concept videos that attempt to "illustrate" the song in an artful manner, rather than just creating a film of an idealized performance.

Other pioneering music videos made during this time include the promotional films made by [[The Doors]]. The group had a strong interest in film, since both lead singer [[Jim Morrison]] and keyboard player [[Ray Manzarek]] had met while studying film at [[UCLA]]. The clip for their debut single "Break On Through" is essentially structured as a filmed performance, but it is notable for its accomplished and atmospheric lighting, camera work and editing. The Doors also directed a superb promotional clip for their controversial 1968 anti-war single "The Unknown Soldier", in which the group stage a mock execution by firing squad. One of the clip's most innovative features is its use of external visuals sources, with extensive intercutting of archival footage and shocking contemporary TV footage of the carnage of the [[Vietnam War]].

[[The Rolling Stones]] produced videos for songs such as "We Love You" (which made reference to the persecution of [[Oscar Wilde]]), "2000 Light Years From Home", "Child of the Moon" and [[Jumping Jack Flash]] and collaborated with [[Jean-Luc Godard]] on the film [[Sympathy for the Devil (film)|Sympathy for the Devil]].

When released in [[1968 in music|1968]], the animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine]]'' was an international sensation, although The Beatles themselves had only a tangential involvement with it. Soon it was commonplace for artists to make promotional films, and bands like [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beach Boys]] were also making promotional films. Although these "film clips" were often aired on pop music TV shows, they were still considered as secondary at that time, with live or mimed performances generally given precedence.

The promotional clip continued to grow in importance, with television programs such as ''[[The Midnight Special (television)|The Midnight Special]]'' and ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' mixing concert footage with clips incorporating camera tricks, special effects, and dramatizations of song lyrics.

Other important contributions to the development of the genre include the film of the [[Woodstock Festival]], and the various concert films that were made during the early Seventies, most notably [[Joe Cocker]]'s ''[[Mad Dogs And Englishmen]]'' and particularly [[Pink Floyd]]'s groundbreaking ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii|Live at Pompeii]]'' concert film, which featured sophisticated rhythmic cross-cutting.

Many countries with local pop music industries soon copied the trend towards music videos. In [[Australia]] promotional films by Australian pop performers were being made on a regular basis by 1966; among the earliest known are clips by Australian groups [[The Masters Apprentices]] and [[The Loved Ones]].

[[Surf film]] makers such as [[Bruce Brown]], [[George Greenough]] and [[Alby Falzon]] also made important contributions in their films, which featured innovative combinations of images and music, and they notably dispensed with all narration and dialogue for many extended surfing sequences in their films, presenting the surfing action accompanied by suitably atmospheric music tracks.

[[Nicolas Roeg]]'s 1970 cult film [[Performance]] contains a sequence in which star of the film [[Mick Jagger]] did a rendition of [[Memo From Turner]] combined with psychadelic video collage.

George Greenough's 1972 film ''[[Crystal Voyager]]'' included a spectacular sequence (filmed by Greenough) that was constructed around the extended [[Pink Floyd]] track "[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]". The group reportedly agreed to allow him to use the music ''gratis'', in exchange for a copy of Greenough's footage, which they used during their concerts for several years.

Other notable Australian developments in this field are the early 1970s monochrome promotional films made by Australian musician and filmmaker [[Chris Lofven]], whose clips for the [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]] song "I'll Be Gone" and the [[Daddy Cool (band)|Daddy Cool]] song "[[Eagle Rock (song)|Eagle Rock]]" were among the best of the early Australian music video productions. It is notable that Lofven's 1971 clip for "Eagle Rock" bears a strong stylistic resemblance to the video for the 1980 hit "[[Brass In Pocket]]" by [[The Pretenders]], and it has been speculated that original bassist [[Pete Farndon]] may well have seen the Lofven clip when he was working in Australia in the mid-1970s as a member of [[Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]].

The first promo clip to combine all the elements of the modern music video is [[David Bowie]]'s promotional clip for the song ''[[The Jean Genie]]'', which was released as single in late [[1972]] at the height of Bowie's [[Ziggy Stardust]] period. Filmed and directed by renowned photographer [[Mick Rock]], this genre-defining four-minute film was produced for less than $350, shot in one day in [[San Francisco]] on 28th October 1972, and edited in less than two days.

The Swedish music group, [[ABBA]], used promotional films throughout the 1970's to promote themselves in other countries when travelling or touring abroad became difficult. Almost all of these videos were directed by ''Chocolat'' and ''My Life as a Dog'' director, [[Lasse Hallstr<U+00F6>m]].

=== Modern era ===

The key innovation in the development of the modern music video was, of course, [[video]] recording and editing processes, along with the development of a number of related effects such as [[chroma-key]]. The advent of high-quality colour videotape recorders and portable video cameras coincided with the DIY ethos of the [[New Wave music|New Wave]] era and this enabled many pop acts to produce promotional videos quickly and cheaply, in comparison to the relatively high costs of using film. However, as the genre developed music video directors increasingly turned to 35mm film as the preferred medium, while others mixed film and video. By the mid-1980s releasing a music video to accompany a new single had become standard, and acts like [[The Jacksons]] sought to gain a commercial edge by creating lavish music videos with million dollar budgets; most notable with the video for "Can You Feel It".

[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" also started a whole new era for using music videos as promos. The first music videos were produced by [[The Monkees|ex-Monkee]] [[Michael Nesmith]] who started making short musical films for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1979. In 1981, he released ''[[Elephant Parts]]'', the first video album and first winner of a [[Grammy]] for music video directed by William Dear. A further experiment on [[NBC]] television called ''[[Television Parts]]'' was not successful, due to network meddling (notably an intrusive [[laugh track]] and corny gags). The early self-produced music videos by [[Devo]], including the pioneering compilation "The Truth About Devolution"  directed by Chuck Statler, were also important (if somewhat subversive) developments in the evolution of the genre and these Devo video cassette releases were arguably among the first true long-form video productions. The [[USA Network|USA Cable Network]] program [[Night Flight (TV series)|''Night Flight'']] was one of the first American programs to showcase these videos as an art form. Premiering in June 1981, ''Night Flight'' predated MTV's launch by two months.

In the UK the importance of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to promote a single created an environment of innovation and competition amongst bands and record labels as the show's producers placed strict limits on the number of videos it would use - therefore a good video would increase a song's sales as viewers hoped to see the video again the following week. David Bowie scored his first UK number one in nearly a decade thanks to director David Mallets' eye catching promo for "[[Ashes to Ashes]]" . Another act to succeed from this tactic was [[Madness (band)|Madness]] who shot on 16mm and 35mm short micro-comedic films.

"''[[Top of the Pops]]''" was censorus in its approach to video content so another approach was for an act to produce a promo that would be banned or edited and so use the resulting controversy and publicity to promote the release. Early examples of this tactic were [[Duran Duran]]'s "Girls on Film" and [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] with "Relax" directed by Bernard Rose.

Although little acknowledged outside Australia, it is arguable that the 1970s-1980s Australian TV pop show ''[[Countdown (TV series)|Countdown]]'' -- and to a lesser extent its commercial competitors ''[[Sounds (TV show)|Sounds]]'' and ''[[Nightmoves (TV show)|Nightmoves]]'' -- were important precursors to MTV.

''Countdown'', which was based on ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'', hit of in Australia but other countries quickly followed the format. At its highpoint during most of the 1980s it was to be aired in 22 countries including TV Europe. In 1978 the Dutch TV-broadcasting company Veronica started a Dutch version of Countdown which during the 80s had [[Adam Curry]] as its best known presenter.  The program gained international significance in the recording industry in the late 1970s and early 80s. Produced on a shoestring by the government-owned [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] national TV network, its low budget, and Australia's distance proved to be influential factors in the show's early preference for music video. The relative rarity of visits by international artists to Australia and the availability of high-quality, free promotional films meant that ''Countdown'' soon came to rely heavily on music videos in order to feature such performers.

The show's talent coordinator [[Ian Meldrum]] and his producers quickly realised that these music videos were becoming an important new commodity in music marketing. For the first time, pre-produced music videos gave TV the opportunity to present pop music in a format that rivalled or even exceed the impact of radio airplay, and it was soon apparent that ''Countdown'' could single-handedly break new pop acts and new songs by established artists -- a role that up until then been the exclusive preserve of [[radio]].

Although ''Countdown'' continued to rely heavily on studio appearances by local and visiting acts, competing shows like ''Sounds'' lacked the resources to present regular studio performances, so they were soon using music videos almost exclusively. As the Eighties progressed, the ability to use music videos to give bands the best possible presentation saw record companies making more, and more lavish, promotional videos.

In 1980 New Zealand group [[Split Enz]] had major success with the single "I Got You" and the album ''True Colours'', and later that year they became one of the first bands in the world to produce a complete set of music videos for each song on the album and to market these on video cassette -- the so-called [[video]]. This was followed a year later by the first American video album, ''The Completion Backwards principle'' directed by Michael Cotten of ''[[The Tubes]]'', however several of their video clips were directed by band member [[noel combie]].

Realising the potential of music video, ''Countdown'' negotiated a controversial deal with local record labels, giving them first refusal and a period of exclusive use for any new video that came into the country, and with its nationwide reach and huge audience, Countdown was able to use music videos to break a number of important new local and overseas acts, notably [[ABBA]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Devo]], [[Cyndi Lauper]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. This early success in Australia in turn enabled these acts to gain airplay and TV exposure and score breakthrough hits in their home countries.

During the 1980s promotional videos became pretty much ''de rigueur'' for most recording artists, a rise which was famously parodied by [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[BBC]] television comedy program ''[[Not The Nine O'Clock News]]'' who produced a spoof music video; "Nice Video, Shame About The Song". [[Frank Zappa]] also parodied the excesses of the genre in his satirical song "Be In My Video".

In the early to mid [[1980s]], artists started to use more sophisticated effects in their videos, and added a storyline or plot to the music video. [[Michael Jackson]] was the first artist to create the concept of the short film. A short film is a music video that has a beginning, middle and end. He did this in a small way with ''[[Billie Jean]]'', directed by [[Steve Barron]], then in a [[West Side Story]] way with director Bob Giraldi's ''[[Beat It]]'', but it wasn't until the 1984 release of the ''[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]'' short film that he took the music video format to another level. ''Thriller'' was a 14-minute-long music video with a clear beginning, middle and ending. Along with the plot, it also had ahead-of-its-time special effects and a memorable dance sequence which has been mimicked ever since this video was released. The video was directed by [[John Landis]]. Jackson then went on to make more famous short films such as, ''[[Bad (song)|Bad]]'' (directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]), ''[[Smooth Criminal]]'', ''[[Remember the Time]]'', ''[[Black or White (Michael Jackson song)|Black or White]]'', ''[[Scream (song)|Scream]]'', ''[[Earth Song]]'' and ''[[Ghosts (Michael Jackson film)|Ghosts]]''.

[[1986]] became a landmark year for music videos, thanks to [[Peter Gabriel]]'s smash hit "[[Sledgehammer]]."  The video broke new ground in the use of special effects and sophisticated animation techniques.  It was animated by British studio [[Aardman Animation]] (and, incidentally, was one of [[Nick Park]]'s first projects with the studio).  [[Sledgehammer]] won 9 MTV Video Music Awards in 1986, a record which still stands.  The video is, to this day, considered one of the most important and influential music videos ever created, being placed at #1 on [[Rolling Stone]] magazine's list of the "Top 100 Music Videos" in 1993, and placing #4 on a similar list from [[MTV]] in 1999.  [[MTV]] has stated that "[[Sledgehammer]]" is the most-played video in the channel's history.  "[[Sledgehammer]]" is not Gabriel's only contribution to the medium, however.  Most of Gabriel's videos employ sophisticated animation and other cutting edge special effects, and he has long been considered one of the music video's foremeost innovators.

A ''non-representational'' music video is one in which the musical artist is never shown. Because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist, such videos are rare; two early 1980s examples, however, are [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[Atlantic City (song)|Atlantic City]]'' directed by Arnold Levine, and [[Penelope Spheeris]]' [[David Bowie]]/[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Under Pressure]]''.  [[Blues Traveler]] spoofs the non-representational style in its video for the song ''Runaround'', in which a thin, stylish group of pretenders lip-synch the music while the real band performs backstage. Almost all of the videos by [[Tool (band)|Tool]] are non-representational.

=== MTV ===
In [[1981]], the [[United States|U.S.]] video channel [[MTV]] launched, beginning an era of 24-hour-a-day music on television. (The first video broadcast was "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", by [[The Buggles]].) With this new outlet for material, the music video would, by the mid-1980s, grow to play a central role in popular music marketing. Many important acts of this period, most notably [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Mylene Farmer]], owed a great deal of their success to the skillful construction and seductive appeal of their videos. Some academics have compared music video to [[silent film]], and it is suggested that stars like Madonna have (often quite deliberately) constructed an image that in many ways echoes the image of the great stars of the silent era such as [[Greta Garbo]]. Although many see MTV as the start of a "golden era" of music videos and the unparalleled success of a new artform in popular culture, others see it as hastening the death of the true musical artist, because physical appeal is now critical to popularity to an unprecedented degree.

In the [[information technology]] era, music videos now approach the popularity of the songs themselves, being sold in collections on [[video tape]] and [[DVD]]. Enthusiasts of music videos sometimes watch them muted purely for their aesthetic value. Instead of watching the video for the music, (the basis for the artform), the videos are appreciated for their visual qualities, while viewers remain uninterested in the [[Sound|audio]] portion of the performance. This is a normal [[sociological]] reaction, some say, to the increasing trend in the [[music business]] to focus on visual appeal of artists, rather than the quality of the music. Critics say that the [[corporation|corporate]] music managers, over the course of logical and calculated business decisions, have sought to capitalize on the [[sex appeal]] of females in music videos rather than in choosing less profitable musicianship-based music.

In recent years, the 24p video technology gained popularity, giving a film look to the music videos.

=== Music video directors and creative rights ===
Since December 1992, when MTV began listing directors with the artist and song credits, music videos have increasingly become an [[auteur]]'s medium. Few if any filmmakers train specifically to make music videos, and very few can afford to make them exclusively. Most split their time between videos and other film projects. Music video directors - who generally conceive, write, and direct their videos - currently receive no authorship, creative rights, profit participation or residual income from [[DVD]]s, iTunes, and other new media on which their work may appear. 

However, those features of the industry that tend to make music video direction a less-than-lucrative profession, have also made the medium an exciting art-form, one defined by the [[cross-pollination]] of ideas and approaches from various disciplines. Music video directors, like most [[filmmakers]] in general, emerge from disparate backgrounds, and don't share much in the way of common thinking or set-in-stone pedagogy, bringing to the field a diversity of experience.

=== Music video censorship ===
As the concept and medium of a music video is a form of artistic expression, artists have been on many occasions censored if their content is deemed offensive. What may be considered offensive will differ in countries due to censorship laws and local customs and ethics. In most cases, the record label will provide and distribute videos edited or provide both censored and uncensored videos for an artist. In some cases, it has been known for music videos to be banned in their entirety as they have been deemed far too offensive to be broadcast. The first video to be banned by [[MTV]] was "[[Girls On Film]]" by [[Duran Duran]] in 1981 because it contained full frontal nudity; it was also banned by the [[BBC]]. In 1989, Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time" video (where the singer performs the song in an extremely revealing body suit surrounded by a ship full of cheering sailors) was also banned by MTV.

In [[1991]] the dance segment of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "Black or White" was cut because it showed Michael Jackson "inappropriately" touching himself in the dance segment. Michael Jackson's most controversial video, "[[They Don't Care About Us]]" was banned from MTV, VH1, and BBC because of the alleged [[anti-Semitic]] message in the song and the visuals in the background of "The Prison Version" of the video. In 2001, Madonna's "What It Feels Like For A Girl" was banned by [[MTV]] due to its graphic depiction of violence. Madonna's music video for the song "Justify My Love" was banned due to its depiction of sadomasochism, homosexuality, cross-dressing, and group sex back in 1990, and in 1992 "Erotica" was aired only 3 times (each time after midnight) due to its sexual depictions of sadomasochism. Madonna pulled her "American Life" video because of its controversial military imagery that seemed inappropriate once the second American war in Iraq began; subsequently, a new video was made for the song. [[The Prodigy]]'s video for "Smack My Bitch Up" was banned in some countries due to depictions of drug use and nudity. The Prodigy's video for "Firestarter" was banned by the [[BBC]] because of its references to arson. [[Thursday]]'s video for War All The Time was banned by MTV because of its supposedly controversial nature. 

[[As of 2005]], the Egyptian state censorship committee has banned at least 20 music videos which featured sexual connotations due to Muslim ethical viewpoints. [[The Sex Pistols]]' video for "God Save the Queen" was banned by the [[BBC]] for its anti-royal sentiment In 2004, many family groups and politicians lobbied for the banning of the [[Eric Prydz]] video "[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call On Me]]" for containing soft pornography, however, the video was not banned. At some point in the past, the video for (S)aint by [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] was banned by that artist's label due to its violence and sexual content.

=== Internet ===
The earliest purveyors of music videos on the internet were members of [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]-based groups who took the time to record music videos as they appeared on television, then digitising them and exchanging the [[MPEG|.mpg files]] via IRC channels. As [[broadband Internet access]] has become available more widely, various initiatives have been made to capitalise on the continued interest in music videos. MTV itself now provides streams of artists' music videos, while [[AOL]]'s recently launched AOL Music features a vast collection of advertising supported downloadable videos. The internet has become the primary growth income market for Record Company produced music videos. At its launch, [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store]] provided a section of free music videos in high quality compression to be watched via the iTunes application. More recently the iTunes Store has begun selling music videos for use on Apple's [[iPod]] with video playback capability. 

Another new phenomenon, deriving from the popularity of [[blog]]ging, is the use of so-called music video "codes", lines of [[HTML]] code including links to music videos that the individual can simply copy and paste into their blog in order to feature a given video [[Streaming media|streaming]] on it. [[YouTube]], [[Google Video]], [[IFilm]] and [[MySpace]] have become primary venues for viewing videos. YouTube is claiming up to six million viral video streams a day. The [[RIAA]] has recently issued cease-and-desist letters to YouTube users to block the sharing of videos.

=== Unofficial music videos ===
With the advent of easy distribution over the internet and cheap video-editing software, a number of fan-created videos began appearing as of the late 1990s. These are typically made by synchronizing existing footage from other sources, such as television series or movie, with the song. In the case of [[anime music video]]s, the source material is drawn from Japanese [[anime]] or from American animation series. Since neither the music nor the film footage is typically licensed, distributing these videos is usually [[copyright infringement]] on both counts. Singular examples of unofficial videos include one made for [[Danger Mouse]]'s illegal [[mash-up]] of the [[Jay-Z]] track "Encore" with music sampled from The Beatles' White Album, in which concert footage of The Beatles is remixed with footage of Jay-Z and rap dancers, as well as a recent politically charged video by Franklin Lopez of subMedia, cut from television footage of the [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] aftermath, set to an unofficial remix of [[Kanye West]]'s "Gold Digger", inspired by the rap-artist's comment "[[George W Bush|George Bush]] doesn't care about black people." Fans gave [[P!nk|Pink]] an unofficial music video for the song "[[Dear Mr. President]]" (in which she criticizes [[George W. Bush]]'s administration), since she stated that will not be released as an official single from her ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' album.

== Timeline ==
*1941: A new invention hits clubs and bars in the USA: The Panoram Soundie is a [[jukebox]] that plays short videoclips along with the music.
*1956: Hollywood discovers the genre of music-centered films. A wave of rock'n'roll films begins (''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'', ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'', ''[[Shake, Rattle and Rock]]'', Rock Pretty Baby, ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', and the famous [[Elvis Presley]] movies). Some of these films integrated musical performances into a story, others were simply revues. 
*1960: In France a re-invention of the Soundie, the [[Scopitone]], gains limited success.
*1962: British Television invents a new form of music television. Shows like ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'', ''[[Ready Steady Go!|Ready! Steady! Go!]]'' and ''Oh, Boy'' started as band vehicles and became huge hits.
*1964: The US-Television market adapts the format. ''Hullabaloo'' is one of the first US shows of this kind, followed by ''Shindig!'' (NBC) and ''American Bandstand''; The Beatles star in ''[[A Hard Day's Night]]''
*1966: The first conceptual promos are aired, for the Beatles' "[[Paperback Writer]]" and "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]". Early in 1967, even more ambitious videos are released for "[[Penny Lane]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]".
