'''Loughrigg Fell''' is a hill in the Central part of the [[England|English]] [[Lake District]]. It stands on the end of the long ridge coming down from [[High Raise, Langdale|High Raise]] over [[Silver How]] towards [[Ambleside]], and is separated from its neighbours by the depression of Red Bank.

==Topography==
The [[fell]] is surrounded by an unusual amount of open water. To the north the River Rothay flows through [[Grasmere]] and [[Rydal Water]] before bending around the eastern side of Loughrigg. On the southern flank the River Brathay runs from [[Elterwater]] and is also fed by the outfall from Loughrigg Tarn. The two rivers merge at Clappersgate on the south eastern corner of the fell, just before flowing into [[Windermere]]. The western boundary is formed by Red Bank (535&nbsp;ft) on the ridge to Silver How. Unnamed becks fall north and south into Grasmere and Elterwater.

Loughrigg has two subsidiary ridges on its eastern flank. Lanty Scar provides the obvious line of ascent from Rydal, while the spur rising over Todd Crag leads up from Clappersgate. There are many areas of woodland on the lower slopes, giving way to a wide expanse of bracken clad knolls and small tarns on the top. The summit is on the western side of the plateau and is identified by an [[Ordnance Survey]] column. Many lower tops also decorate the fell, sometimes to the confusion of visitors. Despite the girdle of lakes only Windermere is visible from the summit. The vista is open to the south over the green and blue country of [[Furness]], with many fells in view on the other three sides.

The fell is easily accessible, being surrounded by roads on all sides. Ambleside and the smaller settlements of Skelwith Bridge, Elterwater, Grasmere and Rydal are all within reach, as is the popular double car park at White Moss Common. Many paths run over the fell including the well known '''Loughrigg Terrace''', a level path with superb views of Grasmere, [[Helm Crag]] and the [[Fairfield]] group. Just beyond the eastern end of the Terrace are some quite remarkable [[caves]], caused by quarrying. They penetrate about 150&nbsp;feet into the hillside and are often full of water; there are other small mines on the fell.

==Geology==
The geology is complex with the [[dacitic]] welded [[lapilli]]-[[tuff]] and [[volcaniclastic]] [[sandstone]] of the Lincomb Tarns Formation outcropping on the south eastern slopes. Nearer the summit are intrusions [[rhyolite]] and sills of [[basalt|basaltic]] [[andesite]]. Drift deposits overlie the north western flanks.<ref name="bgs">[[British Geological Survey]]: 1:50,000 series, sheet 38: BGS (1998)</ref>

==Summit and View==
The highest rocky knoll can be identified by an [[Ordnance Survey]] triangulation column beside a large [[cairn]], both standing out from the turf. The view includes intimate views of the [[Langdale Pikes]] and the fells around [[Grasmere]], together with the [[Fairfield horseshoe]] and the [[Furness Fells|Coniston Fells]]. [[Elterwater]], Grasmere and a large part of [[Windermere]] can also be seen.<ref name="wainwright">{{cite book |author=[[Alfred Wainwright|Wainwright, A]] |title= [[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells|A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]], Book 3 The Central Fells |publisher= Westmorland Gazette |year= 1958}}</ref><ref name="richards">Mark Richards: ''The Central Fells'': Collins (2003): ISBN 0-00-711365-X</ref>


==Ascents==
An easy way up Loughrigg is from the White Moss car park, on the A591 between Grasmere and Rydal Water. This simple walk entails only around 700&nbsp;ft of ascent over 1.5&nbsp;miles. From the car park a trail leads through woods onto Loughrigg Terrace.  From the end of the terrace a path leads up left steeply over steps to the wide, undulating top area. Ascents are also possible from any of the surrounding settlements with manifold variations. The summit is the middle one of three visible knolls.<ref name="wainwright"/><ref name="richards"/>
