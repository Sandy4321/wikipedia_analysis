"'''Imagine'''" is a song written and performed by English musician [[John Lennon]]. The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrical statement is one of [[Collectivism|collectivist]] [[positivism]]. It challenges the listener to imagine a world at peace, without the divisiveness and barriers of religious denominations and nationalities, and to consider the possibility that the focus of humanity should be living a life less attached to material possessions.{{refn|group=nb|Composed in 1971, Lennon wrote "Imagine" in the [[Key (music)|key of C major]], its 4-bar piano intro precedes two 12-bar verses, an 8-bar chorus, a 12-bar verse, an 8-bar chorus, ending with a 4-bar outro. With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a [[time signature]] of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 [[beats per minute]].{{sfn|Lennon|1983|pp=5<U+2013>9}}}}

Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]] co-produced the song and [[Imagine (album)|album of the same name]] with [[Phil Spector]]. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. In 1975, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United Kingdom, in conjunction with his compilation album ''[[Shaved Fish]]'', and it topped the UK chart that year.  The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK.<ref name="guardian nov2012">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/04/uk-million-selling-singles-full-list |title=UK's million-selling singles: the full list |author= Ami Sedghi |publisher=Guardian |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012 }}</ref>

[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] named "Imagine" one of the top 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. It earned a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. A UK survey conducted by the ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums|Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book]]'' named it the second best single of all time, and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number 3 in their list of "[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]". Since 2005, event organisers have played it just before the New Year's [[Times Square Ball]] drops in New York City. Dozens of artists have [[cover version|performed or recorded]] versions of "Imagine", including [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Neil Young]].

==Inspiration and lyrics==

Several poems from [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1964 book ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' inspired [[John Lennon|Lennon]] to write the lyrics for "Imagine"{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212<U+2013>213}}<U+2014>in particular, one [[Capitol Records]] reproduced on the back cover of the original [[Imagine (album)|''Imagine'' LP]] titled "Cloud Piece", which reads, "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in."{{sfn|Spizer|2005|p=54}} Lennon later said that "Imagine" "...should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it <U+2013> the lyric and the concept <U+2013> came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of ''Grapefruit''."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with [[David Sheff]] for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Lennon told Sheff that [[Dick Gregory]] had given him and Ono a [[Christian prayer]] book, which helped inspire what Lennon described as:

{{quote|The concept of positive prayer&nbsp;... If you can ''imagine'' a world at peace, with no denominations of religion<U+2014>not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing<U+2014>then it can be true&nbsp;... the World Church called me once and asked, "Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine ''one'' religion'? That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212<U+2013>213}}}}

With the combined influence of "Cloud Piece" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as "a humanistic [[paean]] for the people."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} Blaney wrote, "Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} With "Imagine", Lennon attempted to raise self-awareness in relation to the way that individuals viewed their interaction with the institutions that affect their lives. Inspired by the anxiety caused by what he perceived as civilisation's inability to maintain a belief among its citizenry in the civilisation's goals, its lyrics ask the listener to abandon three of life's most meaningful concepts: religion, nationhood, and possessions.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} However, Lennon's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities, offering no practical solutions, lyrics that at times seem contradictory, asking the listener to abandon systems while encouraging a system similar to [[Communism]].{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Critics have indicated the hypocrisy in his encouragement of listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions: Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion. Others argue that Lennon intended the song's lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world ''could'' live without possessions, not as an explicit call to give them up.{{sfn|Ingham|2009|p=99}} In 1981, former Beatle [[Ringo Starr]] defended the song's lyrics during an interview with [[Barbara Walters]], stating: "[Lennon] said 'imagine', that's all. Just imagine it."{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}}

Lennon commented: "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} He told ''[[NME]]'': "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about&nbsp;... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice&nbsp;...British Socialism."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Ono described the lyrical statement of "Imagine" as "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described its lyrics as "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}}{{refn|group=nb|The lyrical content of "Imagine" relates to Lennon's concept of [[Nutopia|Nutopia: The Country of Peace]], which he invented in 1973. Lennon included a symbolically mute anthem to this country on his album ''[[Mind Games]]'' released later that year.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=82}}}}

==Composition and music==
Lennon composed "Imagine" one morning in early 1971, on a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] grand piano, in a bedroom at his [[Tittenhurst Park]] estate in Ascot, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen criticised the song's instrumental music as overly "sentimental" and "melodramatic", comparing it to the music of the prerock era and describing the vocal melody as "understated".{{sfn|Urish|Bielen|2007|p=27}}

Lennon wrote "Imagine" in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C. With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a [[time signature]] of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 [[beats per minute]].<ref>For the musical notation to "Imagine" see: {{harvnb|Lennon|1983|pp=5<U+2013>9}}; For the piano on which Lennon composed "Imagine" see: {{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/974485.stm |publisher=BBC News| title=George Michael buys Lennon's piano |date=18 October 2000|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>

==Recording and commercial reception==

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album with [[Phil Spector]], who commented on the track: "We knew what we were going to do&nbsp;... It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well&nbsp;... I always thought that "Imagine" was like the national anthem."<ref> For Spector co-producing with Lennon and Ono see: {{harvnb|Du Noyer|1971|pp=1<U+2013>14}}; For "I always thought that song was like the national anthem" see: {{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=87}}.</ref> Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that<U+2014>[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'&nbsp;... I'll get the initial idea and&nbsp;... we'll just find a sound from [there]."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=50<U+2013>51}}

Recording began at Ascot Sound Studios, Lennon's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City, during July.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=50<U+2013>51}} Relaxed and patient, the sessions began during the late morning, running to just before dinner, in the early evening, with breaks for lunch in the early afternoon. Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for "Imagine", before rehearsing the song until he deemed them ready to record.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} Some early takes of the recording featured Lennon and [[Nicky Hopkins]] playing the same piano, and Spector initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white [[Piano#Grand|baby grand]] in the couple's all white room. However, after having deemed the room's acoustics unsuitable, he abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon's home studio.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} They completed the session in minutes, recording three takes, choosing the second one for release.{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=58}} The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal, [[Klaus Voormann]], bass guitar, [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], drums and the Flux Fiddlers, strings.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=53}} 

Issued in the United States in October 1971, "Imagine" peaked at number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=57}} It reached number 1 in Canada on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart, remaining there for two weeks, and spent five weeks on top of [[Australia]]n number one singles chart, Lennon's only solo Australia number 1.<ref name="RPM71">For "Imagine" at number 1 in Canada on 27 November 1971 see: {{cite web| title= Top Singles <U+2013> Volume 16, No. 15, November 27, 1971 |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.7536&type=1&interval=24 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= Library and Archives Canada| accessdate=1 September 2012}}; For "Imagine" at number 1 in Canada on 4 December 1971 see: {{cite web|title= Top Singles <U+2013> Volume 16, No. 16, December 4, 1971|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.7566&type=1&interval=24|work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> When asked about the song during one of his final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted&nbsp;... Now I understand what you have to do.  Put your political message across with a little honey."{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} Lennon once told [[Paul McCartney]] that "Imagine" was "'[[Working Class Hero]]' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself".{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=179}} On 30 November 1971, the ''Imagine'' LP reached number one on the UK chart.{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=55}} It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.{{sfn|Goldman|1988|p=397}}

In 1972, Lennon and Ono released an 81-minute [[Imagine (film)|film]] to accompany the ''Imagine'' album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their [[Berkshire]] property at Tittenhurst Park as well as in New York City.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=378}} A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song "Imagine" begins. Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression.<ref>For a description of the room and Ono opening shutters see: {{cite book|last=Edmondson|first=Jacqueline|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood|title=John Lennon: A Biography|isbn=978-0-313-37938-3|page=140}}; For the title of Ono's then New York art show see: {{harvnb|Harry|2000b|pp=907<U+2013>908}}.</ref> At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=763}}

Included in the film is a scene during which Lennon talked with an American homeless man whom had been living on their property. The man viewed Lennon as his [[messiah]] figure, to which Lennon responded: "I'm just a guy&nbsp;... that writes songs&nbsp;... [I] take words and stick them together and see if they have any meaning".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=674}} Lennon's vexation quickly turned to charity, and he asked the man: "Are you hungry?"{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=674}} The man concurred, and Lennon replied: "OK, let's give him something to eat."{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=674}} Several celebrities appeared in the film, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Dick Cavett]] and [[George Harrison]]. Derided by critics as "the most expensive home movie of all time", it premiered to an American audience in 1972.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=378}} In 1986, [[Zbigniew Rybczy<U+0144>ski]] made a [[music video]] for the song, and in 1987, it won both the "[[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|Silver Lion]]" award for Best Clip at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and the Festival Award at the [[Festival do Rio|Rio International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishfilmla.org/wocms.php?siteID=13&ID=33|title=Artist/VIP gallery: Zbigniew Rybczynski|publisher=Polish American Film Society|accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>

Re-released in conjunction with the album ''[[Shaved Fish]]'' (1975), "Imagine" topped the UK chart and became Lennon's best-selling single with more than 1,400,000 copies sold in England.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=292}} Re-released as a single in the UK in 1988, it peaked at number 45, and in 1999, it reached number 3.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=292}} In 1999, on National Poetry Day in the United Kingdom, the BBC announced that listeners had voted "Imagine" Britain's favourite song lyric.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=382}} In 2003, it reached number 33 as the B-side to a re-release of "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=292}} In 2010, to commemorate what would have been his 70th year, EMI released remastered versions of eight of Lennon's solo albums, including ''Imagine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emimusic.com/blog/2010/john-lennon-albums-remastered/|title=John Lennon albums remastered|date=29 June 2010|accessdate=11 October 2012|publisher=EMI}}.</ref>
