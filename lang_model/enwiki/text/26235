"'''Joe's Revenge'''" is the fifth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 11)|eleventh season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States on November 18, 2012. 

==Plot==
While watching Quahog 5 News at The Drunken Clam, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], [[Joe Swanson|Joe]], and [[Glen Quagmire|Quagmire]] hear that notorious [[heroin]] mogul Bobby "The Shirt" Briggs has finally been caught after fifteen years on the run. Admitting to lying about being crippled in a fight with [[The Grinch]] on the roof of an orphanage (as seen in "[[A Hero Sits Next Door]]"), Joe reveals the truth: after being outed in an undercover infiltration of the heroin operation, Joe was shot by Briggs point-blank in the legs several times. 

A party is held at Joe's home to celebrate the justice and closure he now feels; Joe notes that the previous night was the first night in the past fifteen years he hadn't strangled [[Bonnie Swanson|Bonnie]] in his sleep. However, breaking news seen at the party reveals that Briggs has escaped police custody during a prison open house. Joe is irate and goes to the [[Chief of police|Chief of Police]] demanding to be placed on the case. He is turned down as the chief citing Joe's being "too close to the case" and assigns the job to two [[police officer]]s that aren't close to the case. Back at The Drunken Clam, Joe expresses his lament. Seeing his friend's anguish, Peter volunteers himself and Quagmire as backup on a mission to catch Briggs. Despite misgivings about police protocol, Joe agrees to the plan and reveals that he has an entire room in his house full of information on Briggs. They decide to head first to Atlantic City, where works a [[stripper]] known to have had a relationship with Briggs.

Before the trio departs, Quagmire leaves with [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] his newest cat, Principessa (a full-blooded Persian), and very exacting instructions about caring for it. 

In [[Atlantic City]], the trio find Bobby's old girlfriend at a strip club. When Joe's direct questioning fails, Quagmire cites his ability to communicate with strippers and extracts Briggs's exact address through a sexual osmosis he calls the "[[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind_melds|Vulcan V meld]]". 

Meanwhile, back in [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]], [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] becomes jealous of the attention Quagmire's cat gets and gives. When [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] proclaims cats to be better than dogs, Brian is injured trying to prove that dogs also always land on their feet.

In Atlantic City, the three easily locate Briggs's apartment, and Joe is able to confront Briggs, who nonetheless escapes after throwing a quilt into Joe's face. A rooftop chase ensues, which results in Joe's being able to survive being dropped several stories by landing directly on his legs. Nonetheless, Briggs is able to escape by hiding behind the bus on a suddenly appearing ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''. Joe, Quagmire, and Peter are then arrested by two police officers for interfering with the case. Joe realizes that the arresting police officers are corrupt and have been involved with hiding Briggs. Quagmire manages to free them from handcuffs using a combination of his Swiss Army Penis and acetylene torch penis, and the three steal the police cruiser. Peter reveals that he has been saving (for a trip [[scrapbooking|scrapbook]]) a phone number he picked up at Briggs's apartment. Joe recognizes the area code as being for [[Ju<U+00E1>rez, Mexico]], and the three jet off for [[El Paso]] in an attempt to head off Briggs.

Back in Quahog, where Principessa is seen pawing at a sleeping Lois's breasts. Brian attempts to subtly substitute his own paws for the cat's, but Lois awakens. Brian knocks her out with a lamp and drives off in jealousy of the cat.

Having reached [[Mexico<U+2013>United States border|the border]], Joe, Peter, and Quagmire wait in the scorching heat until they realize it may be days until Briggs arrives, as he is presumably traveling by car. After passing some time at El Paso's [[John J. Pershing|Pershing]] House, the trio check traffic until Briggs arrives. Joe gives chase as Briggs jumps into the [[Rio Grande]], and he is eventually able to get Briggs at gunpoint. He shoots Briggs in the legs after a speech about the consequences of being crippled. He only intends to cripple Briggs as revenge, but Briggs bleeds to death through his [[femoral artery]]. Quagmire then nonchalantly kicks Briggs's corpse into the river to carry it away to Mexico. Joe, Peter, and Quagmire return to Quahog and Joe thanks the others for risking their lives for him. Peter and Quagmire then notice blood dripping out of Joe's pant leg, and Joe replies that he "had a ball blown in the river", before the episode ends.
