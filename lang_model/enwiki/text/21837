'''SAS''' (Statistical Analysis System) is a software suite developed by [[SAS Institute]] for advanced analytics, [[business intelligence]], [[data management]], and [[predictive analytics]]. It is the largest market-share holder for advanced analytics.

SAS was developed at [[North Carolina State University]] from 1966 until 1976, when SAS Institute was incorporated. SAS was further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of new statistical procedures, additional components and the introduction of [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP]]. A point-and-click interface was added in version 9 in 2004. A social media analytics product was added in 2010.

==Technical overview and terminology==
SAS is a software suite that can mine, alter, manage and retrieve data from a variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it.<ref name="encycl"/> SAS provides a graphical point-and-click user interface for non-technical users and more advanced options through the [[SAS programming language]].<ref name="encycl">
{{cite doi
| 10.4135/9781412961288}}</ref> SAS programs have a DATA step, which retrieves and manipulates data, usually creating a SAS data set, and a PROC step, which analyzes the data.<ref name="court"/>

Each step consists of a series of statements.<ref name="DelwicheSlaughter2012">

In the compilation phase, declarative statements are processed and syntax errors are identified. Afterwards, the execution phase processes each executable statement sequentially.<ref name="Li2013">

The PROC step consists of PROC statements that call upon named procedures. Procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics, analyses and graphics. There are more than 300 procedures and each one contains a substantial body of programming and statistical work.<ref name="court"/> PROC statements can also display results, sort data or perform other operations.<ref name="DelwicheSlaughter2012"/> SAS Macros are pieces of code or variables that are coded once and referenced to perform repetitive tasks.<ref name="BassSolutions2007">

== History ==

===Origins===
[[Anthony J. Barr]] began developing the structure and language of SAS at [[North Carolina State University]] in 1966 by placing statistical procedures into a formatted file framework. He was joined by student [[James Goodnight]] in 1972, who developed the software's statistical routines.<ref name="timeline"/> In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new [[multiple regression]] and [[analysis of variance]] routines.<ref name="Attr76">{{Cite journal|first=Anthony|last=Barr|coauthors=James Goodnight|title=The SAS Staff|year=1976|quote=SAS 72 and SAS 76 are attributed to Barr, Goodnight, Service, Perkins, and Helwig|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.<ref name="Attr76"/> The software was originally intended to increase the output of crops by analyzing agricultural data<ref name="berk"/><ref name="seventyeight">

===Development===
SAS was re-designed in SAS 76 with an open architecture that allowed for [[compilers]] and procedures. The INPUT and INFILE statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by IBM mainframes. Generating reports was also added through the PUT and FILE statements. The ability to analyze [[general linear model]]s was also added<ref>

Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.<ref name="expert"/>

SAS version 4 had limited features, but made SAS more accessible. Version 5 introduced a complete macro language, array subscripts, and a full-screen interactive user interface called Display Manager.<ref name="expert"/> In 1985, SAS was rewritten in the [[C programming language]]. This allowed for the SAS' Multivendor Architecture that allows the software to run on [[UNIX]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[Windows]]. It was previously written in [[PL/I]], [[Fortran]], and [[assembly language]].<ref name="timeline"/><ref name="expert"/>

In the 1980s and 1990s, SAS released a number of components to complement Base SAS. SAS/GRAPH, which produces graphics, was released in 1980, as well as the SAS/ETS component, which supports econometric and time series analysis. A component intended for pharmaceutical users, SAS/PH-Clinical, was released in the 1990s. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] standardized on SAS/PH-Clinical for new drug applications in 2002.<ref name="timeline">

SAS version 6 was used throughout the 1990s and was available on a wider range of operating systems, including [[Macintosh]], [[OS/2]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Primos]]. SAS introduced new features through dot-releases. From 6.06 to 6.09, a user interface based on the windows paradigm was introduced and support for SQL was added.<ref name="expert"/> Version 7 introduced the Output Delivery System (ODS) and an improved text editor. ODS was improved upon in successive releases. For example, more output options were added in version 8. The number of operating systems that were supported was reduced to [[UNIX]], [[Windows]] and [[z/OS]], and [[Linux]] was added.<ref name="expert"/><ref name="supported systems">

===Comparison to other products===
{{see also|Comparison of statistical packages}}
In a 2005 article for the ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'' comparing statistical packages from SAS and its competitors [[Stata]] and [[SPSS]], Alan C. Acock wrote that SAS programs provide "extraordinary range of data analysis and data management tasks," but were [[Usability|difficult to use]] and learn.<ref name="Acock"/> SPSS and Stata, meanwhile, were both easier to learn (with better documentation) but had less capable analytic abilities, though these could be expanded with paid (in SPSS) or free (in Stata) add-ons.  Acock concluded that SAS was best for [[power user]]s, while occasional users would benefit most from SPSS and Stata.<ref name="Acock">{{cite journal|pages=1093<U+2013>1095|title=SAS, Stata, SPSS: A Comparison |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00196.x|volume=67|issue=4 |date=November 2005 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00196.x/full | last=Acock |first=Alan C}}</ref> A comparison by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], gave similar results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/compare_packages.htm |title=Compare Packages |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>

Competitors such as [[Revolution Analytics]] and [[Alpine Data Labs]] advertise their products as considerably cheaper than SAS'. In a 2011 comparison, Doug Henschen of ''[[InformationWeek]]'' found that start-up fees for the three are similar, though he admitted that the starting fees were not necessarily the best basis for comparison.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/low-cost-options-for-predictive-analytics-challenge-sas-ibm/d/d-id/1099191?page_number=1 |title=Low-Cost Options For Predictive Analytics Challenge SAS, IBM|first=Dough |last=Henschen |work=InformationWeek|date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref> SAS' business model is not weighted as heavily on initial fees for its programs, instead focusing on revenue from annual subscription fees.<ref>{{Cite news|title=SAS' revenue up 12% in 2011|work=The News & Observer |location= Raleigh, North Carolina |date=January 20, 2012 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/01/20/1790587/sas-revenue-up-12-in-2011.html|last=Ranii|first=David |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref>
