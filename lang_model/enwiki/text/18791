'''State Route&nbsp;503''' (SR&nbsp;503) is a {{convert|54.11|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] serving [[Clark County, Washington|Clark]] and [[Cowlitz County, Washington|Cowlitz]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The highway travels north from a short [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Washington State Route 500|SR&nbsp;500]] in [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] through [[Battle Ground, Washington|Battle Ground]], the eastern terminus of [[Washington State Route 502|SR&nbsp;502]], and communities in rural Clark County before crossing the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] on the [[Yale Bridge]]. SR&nbsp;503 intersects its [[Washington State Route 503 Spur|spur route]] and turns west to parallel the Lewis River downstream to [[Woodland, Washington|Woodland]], where the highway ends at an interchange with [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate&nbsp;5]] (I-5). The highway was part of the [[Lewis River Road]], signed as [[State Road 15 (Washington 1909-1919)|State Road&nbsp;15]], from 1909 until 1919. The current route of SR&nbsp;503 was split between Secondary State Highway&nbsp;1S (SSH&nbsp;1) from Woodland to Battle Ground and SSH&nbsp;1U from Battle Ground to Orchard in 1937, combined to form SR&nbsp;503 during the [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]]. A spur route, established in 1991, travels northeast into the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]] along [[Yale Lake]], serving the community of [[Cougar, Washington|Cougar]].

Every year, the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was the SR&nbsp;500 concurrency in Orchards, serving 34,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was at the western terminus of SR&nbsp;503&nbsp;Spur east of Yale, serving 720 vehicles.<ref name="ATR">{{citation |author=Staff |year=2011 |title=2011 Annual Traffic Report |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/pdf/Annual_Traffic_Report_2011.pdf |format=PDF |pages=185&ndash;187 |accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> SR&nbsp;503 between Orchards and Battle Ground is designated as part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name="NHS">{{cite map |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |title=National Highway System: Portland, OR--WA |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/oregon/portland_or.pdf |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name="NHS-about">{{citation |title=What is the National Highway System? |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref>
