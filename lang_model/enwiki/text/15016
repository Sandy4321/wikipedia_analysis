==Plot synopsis==
[[David Blaine]] comes to South Park and impresses the town's residents, including [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], with his [[magic (illusion)|street magic]]. The boys join "Blaintology," a [[cult]] in hopes of learning about magic. Stan is disturbed by the cult and soon leaves; Kyle refuses to join him. Stan looks for help from South Park's own resident messiah, [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus]].

At Blaine's big show in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], Jesus appears and challenges Blaine by performing one of his famous miracles, the [[feeding the multitude|miracle of the loaves and fishes]]. However, this miracle proves dubious (he has everybody in the audience turn around while he performs it), and Blaine manages to win the crowd with much more powerful enchantments. Jesus realizes he needs help and calls the Super Best Friends, a group of major religious figures including [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Moses]], [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]], [[Krishna]], [[Lao Tzu]], [[Muhammad]] and [[Aquaman|Sea Man]] (which the other characters jokingly pronounce as "[[Semen]]") who defend the world against [[evil]] (except for Buddha who doesn't really believe in evil).

The Blaintologists, meanwhile, petition the government for [[tax exemption|tax-exempt status]], which would make them a real religion and therefore unstoppable. But when they are denied, all the Blaintologists are told they are to commit [[mass suicide]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Kyle realizes now that the cult is evil, but when he tries to convince Cartman that they should flee, Cartman tells on him and Kyle is imprisoned in a glass bubble and told he will be killed at the mass suicide. When word about the mass suicide reaches the Super Best Friends, they consult [[Moses]] (previously seen in [[Jewbilee]]) for advice.

In D.C., the Blaintologists begin to drown themselves in the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]] (even though it is only about a foot deep), and Cartman puts a hose in Kyle's glass bubble to fill it with water to kill him. The Super Best Friends arrive, but Blaine brings the [[Lincoln Memorial|statue of Abraham Lincoln]] to life to fight them.

Meanwhile, Stan went out in search of his friends. He finds Kenny drowned in the pool and shouts, "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!" and Kyle shouts, "You bastards!" Stan repeats the phrase in [[Marco Polo (game)|Marco Polo]] fashion to find Kyle. To defeat the [[Abraham Lincoln]] statue, the Super Best Friends create a giant animated [[John Wilkes Booth]] statue, and it shoots Blaine's puppet in the head.  The resulting fall of the Lincoln statue shatters Kyle's prison (which the statue had picked up and shaken, believing it to be a snow globe) and the memorial pool is frozen using [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith's]] ice powers to prevent more suicides.

Cartman has not managed to kill himself because he keeps coming up for air.  Blaine curses the Super Best Friends for ruining his plans and flies away in a rocket ship, and Stan announces to everyone that any religion that forces people to give up their money or control of their lives is really a cult.  Kyle reconciles with Stan.  Cartman says mockingly, "Aww!  That's so sweet, you guys!" then asks them if they want to get a room to [[French Kiss|make out]] for a while, but then ends up getting beaten up by both of them. The Super Best Friends then fly away, to wait until the world needs their aid again.

==Reference to Scientology==
In the DVD commentary, Parker talks about how the episode's reference to real-life magician [[David Blaine]] and ''Blaintology'' was "really basically [[Scientology]]".<ref>Season 5 DVD commentary</ref>
