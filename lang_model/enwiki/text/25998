'''Suffolk''' is an independent city located in the state of [[Virginia]], within the [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] of [[Hampton Roads]].  As of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 84,585<ref>[http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics Coopercenter.org], Weldon Cooper Center 2010 Census Count Retrieved January 28, 2011</ref> and a median household income of $57,546.  Suffolk is the largest city in Virginia, by area.

==History==
{{Main|History of Suffolk, Virginia}}
Suffolk was founded by English colonists in 1742 as a port town on the [[Nansemond River]] in the [[Virginia Colony]].  Originally known as Constant's Warehouse, for John Constant, Suffolk was renamed after Royal Governor [[William Gooch]]'s home of [[Suffolk]], a county in [[East Anglia]], [[England]].  Before European contact, indigenous American tribes lived in the region for thousands of years.  At the time of English settlement, the [[Nansemond]] Indians lived along the river.  In the early colonial years, the English cultivated [[tobacco]] as a [[commodity]] crop, but later turned to mixed farming.  It became the county seat of [[Nansemond County, Virginia|Nansemond County]] in 1750.

Early in its history, Suffolk became a land transportation gateway to the areas east of it in [[South Hampton Roads]].  Before the [[American Civil War]], both the [[Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad]] and the [[Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad]] were built through Suffolk, early predecessors of 21st century [[Class 1 railroad]]s operated by [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]], respectively.  Other railroads and later major highways followed after the war.

Suffolk became an [[incorporated town]] in 1808.  In 1910, it incorporated as a city and separated from Nansemond County.  However, it remained the seat of Nansemond County until 1972, when its former county became the [[Nansemond, Virginia|independent city of Nansemond]].  In 1974, the independent cities of Suffolk and Nansemond merged under Suffolk's name and charter.

[[Peanut]]s grown in the surrounding areas became a major industry for Suffolk.  Notably, [[Planters|Planters' Peanuts]] was established in Suffolk beginning in 1912.  Suffolk was the 'birthplace' of [[Mr. Peanut]], the mascot of Planters' Peanuts.  For many years, the call-letters of local [[AM radio]] station [[WLPM]] stood for '''W'''orld's '''L'''argest '''P'''eanut '''M'''arket.

==Geography==
Suffolk is located at {{coord|36.741347|-76.609881|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (36.741347, -76.609881).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 429.1&nbsp;square miles (1,111.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which, 400.0&nbsp;square miles (1,036.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is land and 29.0&nbsp;square miles (75.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (6.77%) is water.Part of the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] is located in Suffolk.

===Demographics===
[[Image:USA Suffolk city, Virginia age pyramid.svg|left|thumb|Age distribution in Suffolk.]]

[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics or Latinos]] of any race were 2.9% of the population.

There were 23,283 households out of which 36.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.1% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.9% were non-families. 20.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

===2008 tornado===
The city [[Tornadoes of 2008#April 28|was hit by]] an ''EF3'' [[tornado]] which produced a large swath of extensive damage through the city and nearby communities during the late afternoon of Monday 28 April 2008.<ref>[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/akq/wx_events/severe/april28_2008/april28_2008.html Erh.noaa.gov]</ref>

[[Image:Suffolk Tornado Damage.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Aerial view of tornado damage in Suffolk on April 28, 2008.]]
After 4:00 PM EST on April 28, 2008, a tornado touched down multiple times causing damage and leaving over 200 injured in Suffolk along a path which passed north and west of the downtown area striking near Sentara Obici Hospital and in the [[unincorporated community|unincorporated town]] of [[Driver, Virginia|Driver]]. The storm seriously damaged over 120 homes and 12 businesses. The subdivisions of Burnett's Mill and Hillpoint Farms were damaged particularly hard, as well as several of the older historic structures in Driver. However, near Driver, large radio and television broadcast towers located in an [[antenna farm]] serving most of Hampton Roads were spared serious damage.

Governor Timothy Kaine declared a state of emergency and directed state agencies to assist the recovery and cleanup efforts. Police officers and firefighters from across Hampton Roads were sent to Suffolk to help in the quarantine and cleanup of the damaged areas.

On May 1, the property damages were estimated at $20 million.

==Education==
{{Main|Suffolk City Public Schools}}
Suffolk Public Schools, the local public school system, operates 12 [[elementary school]]s, four [[middle school]]s, three [[high school]]s, and one alternative school. [[Nansemond-Suffolk Academy]] is a private college preparatory school located on Pruden Blvd.

==Transportation==
{{See also|Hampton Roads#Transportation|l1=Transportation in the Hampton Roads region}}
Suffolk's early growth was fueled by its location and transportation considerations. These continue to be major factors in the 21st century.

===Bike trails===
The Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge includes dozens of miles of trails accessible via White Marsh Road at Washington Ditch and other entry sites. Additional bike trails can be found at Lone Star Lakes City Park off of Godwin Blvd. This city park provides over {{convert|4|mi|km}} of rock trails. There are many rural roads with light traffic available for road riding. Adjacent to Suffolk, VA is Smithfield, VA where a city facility called Nike Park includes a bike trail approximately 2{{frac|1|2}} miles in a loop.

===Waterways===
Suffolk was initially a port at the [[head of navigation]] of the [[Nansemond River]]. The Nansemond River flows into the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] near its mouth and the great ice-free harbor of [[Hampton Roads]].

===Railroads===
The two [[railroad]]s completed through Suffolk before the [[American Civil War]] were later joined by four more. These were eventually consolidated during the modern merger era of North American railroads which began around 1960. Today, Suffolk is served by three freight railroads, and is located on a potential line for high speed passenger rail service between Richmond and South Hampton Roads being studied by the [[Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation]].

===Highways===
Suffolk is served by U.S. Highways [[U.S. Highway 17|17]], [[U.S. Highway 13|13]], [[U.S. Highway 58|58]], [[U.S. Highway 258|258]], and [[U.S. Highway 460|460]]. [[Interstate 664]], part of the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]], crosses through the northeastern  edge of the city. [[Route 10 (Virginia)|State Route 10]] is also a major highway in the area.

In 2006, Suffolk assumed control of its road system from the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]], which is customary among Virginia's [[Independent city (United States)|independent cities]], although since the [[Byrd Road Act]] of 1932 created Virginia's Secondary Roads System, which maintains the roads in most counties and town. An exception was made by the General Assembly when the former Nansemond County became an independent city and consolidated Suffolk in the 1970s. The state still maintained the primary and secondary routes in Suffolk until July 1, 2006.

===Bridges, bridge-tunnel===
The southern terminus of the four-laned [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]], completed in 1992, is in Suffolk. There have been conflicts with VDOT and the city over ownership and responsibility for the circa 1928 [[Kings Highway Bridge]] across the Nansemond River on [[State Route 125 (Virginia)|State Route 125]], which was closed in 2005 by VDOT for safety reasons.<ref>Aaron Applegate, [http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=103770&ran=180217 VDOT, city of Suffolk battle over closed Kings Highway Bridge], [[The Virginian-Pilot]], May 1, 2006</ref><ref>John Warren, [http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=107357&ran=210248 Flooding blamed on clogged ditches], [[The Virginian-Pilot]], July 11, 2006</ref> About 3,300 motorists a day used the bridge that connected [[Chuckatuck, Virginia|Chuckatuck]] and [[Driver, Virginia|Driver]]. Now, they face detours of as much as {{convert|19|mi|km}}. The cost of a new bridge for the King's Highway crossing is estimated at $48 million, far more than could be recovered through collection of tolls at that location.<ref>[http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=103770&ran=180217 Content.hamptonroads.com]</ref> In 2007, VDOT announced that it would contract for demolition and removal of the bridge. According to newspaper accounts, this will be the first time in VDOT's history of such action when no replacement facility was planned.<ref>[http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=121606&ran=91528 Contant.hamptronroads.com]</ref>

Virginia is currently reviewing proposals under a [[public-private partnership]] for a major realignment and upgrade of U.S. 460 from Suffolk west to [[Interstate 295 (Virginia)|Interstate 295]] near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]]. In 1995, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed the Public-Private Transportation Act allowing private entities to propose innovative solutions for designing, constructing, financing, and operating transportation improvements. The new roadway would be funded through collection of [[toll roads|tolls]].

As part of the Suffolk 2026 Comprehensive Plan, the city plans to bypass the crossroads community of [[Whaleyville, Virginia|Whaleyville]] in southwestern Suffolk City. [[U.S. Route 13 in North Carolina|US 13]] (along with [[NC 11|NC Highway 11]]) is a strategic highway corridor in North Carolina towards [[Greenville, NC|Greenville]].<ref>[http://www.suffolkva.us/PCD/planning/long-range/comp-plans.html City of Suffolk, Virginia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.ncdot.gov/doh/preconstruct/tpb/shc/vision/SHCMaps/graphics/SHC_Vision_Plan.jpg</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:RBOX 30437.jpg|thumb|150px|A RailBox [[boxcar]] exporting peanuts.]]
In modern times, Suffolk remains a major [[peanut]] processing center and railroad and highway transportation hub. It hosts a diverse combination of industrial, manufacturing, distribution, retail, and hospitality businesses, as well as active farming.

[[Planters|Planters' Peanuts]] continues to be a major employer, now owned by [[Kraft Foods]]. Other large employers in the City of Suffolk include [[Unilever]], [[Lipton|Lipton Tea]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[QVC]], and two major modeling and simulation companies,  [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Raytheon]]. Lockheed Martin bases its Center for Innovation in Suffolk. The Center for Innovation is called 'The Lighthouse' because the campus is built around a lighthouse and actually envelops the lighthouse.  

Suffolk experienced a boom in its high tech economy given the presence of the [[U.S. Joint Forces Command]] (JFCOM) facility located in north Suffolk near the intersection of US 17 and Interstate 664.   In 1999, JFCOM stood up and through the decade JFCOM steadily grew the number of defense contractors it employed until it reached over 3,000.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  By September 2010, however, US Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] recommended JFCOM disestablishment to the President as a matter of reallocating and rebalancing the U.S. Department of Defense budget so as to better address the changing needs and fiscal demands of the Department.  The announcement led to speculation about what impact the disestablishment of JFCOM would have on the Hampton Roads economy in general and (more specifically) the sustainment of businesses located in the Harborview section of Suffolk.  In August 2011 JFCOM was disestablished, however, many critical JFCOM functions like joint training, joint exercises and joint development were retained in the buildings vacated by JFCOM in north Suffolk but under the auspices of the Joint Staff J7 Directorate, and is now referred to as either "Pentagon South" or "Joint and Coalition Warfighting".  

By summer 2013, city officials expect the Naval Network Warfare Command, NNWC Global Network Operations Center Detachment, Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command and Navy Cyber Forces to occupy the other buildings vacated by JFCOM.  These commands are a boon to north Suffolk and will bring an estimated 1,000 additional employees, counting military, civilians and contractors. The estimated annual payroll is estimated to be $88.9 million.

In 2002, the new Louise Obici Memorial Hospital was completed and dedicated. The hospital was acquired in 2005 by the [[Sentara Health System]].

Each year in the fall, the City of Suffolk hosts Suffolk Festivals Incorporated's annual Peanut Fest; the 2007 Peanut Fest was the 30th since its inception.

==Sister cities==
In 1981, Suffolk County, England became Suffolk's first sister city as a result of the personal interest in the Sister Cities concept by Virginia's Governor, Mills E. Godwin. A native of our city, Governor Godwin believed that Sister Cities would benefit the community culturally and educationally. Suffolk's second sister city relationship with Oderzo, Italy, began in 1995 because of one man, Amedeo Obici. Mr. Obici was a native of Oderzo and the founder of Planters Nut and Chocolate Company in Suffolk.

Suffolk Sister Cities International, Inc. (SSCI) is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit established to promote international relationships as directed by Suffolk City Council through its appointed Suffolk Sister Cities Commission.  Its membership is open to all who are interested in fostering the goals of the organization.

SSCI and its international youth association, SIYA, have won national awards for Youth and Education and for the Best Overall Program for cities with populations less than 100,000.<ref>http://www.suffolksistercities.com/Suffolk_Sister_Cities/About_Us.html</ref>
