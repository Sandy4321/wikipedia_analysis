'''Alfredo Zalce Torres''' (January 12, 1908-January 19, 2003) was a [[List of Mexican artists|Mexican artist]] who achieved success despite is aversion to promotion and publicity. He was a main figure in [[expressive figurativism]] in Mexico and contemporary with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]] and other muralists although he did not achieve the fame that they did. He was reluctant to accept awards, turning down Mexico<U+2019>s [[Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes]] before finally accepting it in 2001. While he spent much of his career teaching and founding educational and cultural institutions, he is also known for his mural work.

Early in his career he was friends with many of Mexico<U+2019>s muralist generation including Diego Rivera, [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Clemente Orozco]] and [[Frida Kahlo]]. Unlike other artists, Zalce spent his lifetime avoiding fame and fortune, preferring to paint what he wanted rather than what would sell.<ref name ="mexconnect"/>

==Career==
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Zalce is not as well known as other Mexican muralists because he avoided promotion, unlike most other artists. Most of the work was sold by the artist himself to people he considered friends. His importance began to be noticed shortly before his death in 2003, with his works gaining in value. He generally did not work with art galleries because they would pressure him into painting what they could sell and he painted what he wanted. Despite this, buyer waited months and years to obtain artwork from him. When the government of Michoac<U+00E1>n changed the name of its museum of contemporary art to honor him, he had to be tricked into attending the inauguration ceremony, as he did not like the prominent use of his name.<ref name ="mexconnect"/> He referred to [[Van Gogh]], who did not sell a single painting before his death because he did not promote himself.<ref name ="semblanza"/> 

Much of his career was spent teaching and cultural activities including the founding of schools and other organizations.<ref name ="mexconnect"/> He first went to Zacatecas to teach art but the [[Cristero War]] had ended only shortly before and the school was not permitted to operate due to lingering political tensions.<ref name ="semblanza"/> He taught drawing at various primary schools for the [[Secretariat of Education]] from 1932 to 1935. In 1944, he became a teacher at the [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"|La Esmeralda]] and Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl<U+00E1>sticas. He moved to Morelia in 1950 and became the director of the Escuela de Pintura y Escultura. He also worked as a professor at the [[Universidad Aut<U+00F3>noma de Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]] and the Escuela Popular de Bellas Artes.<ref name ="redescolar"/> He also illustrated books with academic and social themes.<ref name ="semblanza"/>

One of the first tasks of this group was to oppose the then favorable disposition of many in Mexico towards [[Adolf Hitler]] after he took power in Germany in 1934.<ref name ="semblanza"/>

In 1930, he created a mural for the primary school in Ayotla, [[State of Mexico]]. In 1932, he painted frescos at the Escuela para Mujeres in [[Mexico City]].  He painted murals in the former [[Talleres Gr<U+00E1>ficos de la Naci<U+00F3>n]] in 1936, one in collaboration with [[Leopoldo M<U+00E9>ndez]] at the Escuela Normal de Puebla in 1938, at the Palacio de Gobierno and the C<U+00E1>mera de Diputados in Michoac<U+00E1>n with [[<U+00C1>ngel Bracho]] in 1948.<ref name ="redescolar"/> He created the <U+201C>History of Morelia<U+201D> bronze mural between 1961 and 1962 at the Palacio de Gobierno of Michoac<U+00E1>n, which measures 350 m2.  Other murals were created in the Museo Regional Michoacano, the Casa Natal de Morelos and the Museo de Arte Comtempor<U+00E1>neo Alfredo Zalco.<ref name ="ejecucion">{{cite news |title= Fue Alfredo Zalce un artista consagrado en la ejecuci<U+00F3>n pl<U+00E1>stica |url= http://www.cambiodemichoacan.com.mx/vernota.php?id=166564 |newspaper=Cambio de Michoac<U+00E1>n |location=Morelia |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Alfredo Zalco was an artist consecrated to the execution of fine arts}}</ref> 

Exhibitions of his work have been held in many countries of the world.<ref name ="mexconnect"/> In 1932, he had his first exhibition at the Jos<U+00E9> Guadalupe Posada Gallery in Mexico City. And later at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in 1948. His work can be found in the permanent collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York as well as museums in [[Stockholm]], [[Warsaw]], [[Sofia]] and Mexico City.<ref name ="redescolar"/>

He earned almost every honor available for Mexican artists, most accepted reluctantly. He declined the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Arte twice because of the attention it attracts before he finally accepted in 2001.<ref name ="mexconnect"/> Other recognitions include General<U+00ED>simo Morelos in 1969 from the city of Morelia and Vasco de Quiroga from P<U+00E1>tzcuaro in 1985.<ref name ="redescolar"/> In 1979, the government of Michoac<U+00E1>n created the Premio de Artes Pl<U+00E1>sticas Alfredo Zalce.<ref name ="semblanza"/>

==Artistry==
He worked in oil, acrylic, [[batik]], pencil, watercolor, engraving, [[serigraph]], bronze stone, ink, pastel, ceramics, monotype, precious metals and more.<ref name ="semblanza"/><ref name ="mexconnect"/><ref name ="lrodriguez">{{cite news |title= Alfredo Zalce artista con sentido cr<U+00ED>tico |author= Lorena Rodr<U+00ED>guez Rojas |url= http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/9030901 |newspaper=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Alfredo Zalco, artist with a critical sense }}</ref> As a muralist, he was the first to use colored cement and often worked contrary to trends of his time.<ref name ="lrodriguez"/> Zalce felt that drawing is fundamental to being an artist. He also stated that along with artistic talent, imagination is necessary; otherwise, the artist is merely a camera. He drawing skills made him one of Mexico<U+2019>s first great engravers, using all engraving techniques, with plates in [[zinc]], bronze, wood and [[linoleum]]. In his later career, he concentrated on working with batik. This process is normally used to put designs on cloth, but Zalco used it to produce art. He felt it more important than doing watercolors as the wax process took days and errors could not be fixed.<ref name ="mexconnect"/>

Zalce is one of the main figures of [[expressive figurativism]] which was prominent from 1920 to 1950 in Mexico.<ref name ="lrodriguez"/> His work is characterized by defined clean outlines and images of ordinary life and people, often with social criticism. Gestures are often prominent in his work to indicate those who are oppressed versus the powerful.<ref name ="lrodriguez"/> Like others of the muralist generation, his murals contain morals. One of these is the mural <U+201C>Abogados<U+201D>  (Lawyers) at the Procuraduria General de la Rep<U+00FA>blica building. This work shows lawyers hiding their faces as they step over the body of a losing client. Another shows [[Agust<U+00ED>n de Iturbide]] and [[Vicente Guerrero]] shaking hands, but Iturbide has blood on his hands and a crown behind his back to represent his imperial aims.<ref name ="mexconnect"/>
