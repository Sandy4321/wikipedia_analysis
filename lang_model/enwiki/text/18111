'''Per Erik Rutger Martin-L<U+00F6>f''' (born 1942) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[logician]], [[philosopher]], and [[mathematical statistics|mathematical statistician]]. He is internationally renowned for his work on the foundations of probability, statistics, mathematical logic, and computer science.  In recent years, Martin-L<U+00F6>f has been active in developing [[intuitionistic type theory]] as a constructive foundation of mathematics.  

Per Martin-L<U+00F6>f holds a joint chair for Mathematics and Philosophy at [[Stockholm University]].  

His brother [[Anders Martin-L<U+00F6>f]] is now emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University; the two brothers have collaborated in research in probability and statistics. The research of Anders and Per Martin-L<U+00F6>f research has influenced statistical theory, especially regarding [[exponential families]], the [[expectation-maximization method]] for [[missing data]], and [[model selection]]. 

Per Martin-L<U+00F6>f is an enthusiastic [[bird-watcher]], whose first scientific publication was on the mortality rates of [[bird ringing|ringed birds]].

In 1964<U+2013>65 Martin-L<U+00F6>f was studying under the supervision of [[Kolmogorov]] in Moscow, refining the notion of a [[random sequence]]. During this time he wrote his frequently cited article ''On the definition of random sequences''.

The problem of determining the [[biological sex]] of a bird, which is extremely difficult for humans, is one of the first examples in Martin-L<U+00F6>f's lectures on [[statistical model]]s. The problem of determining the sex of a bird is a problem of  estimation with [[missing data]].

=== Probability on algebraic structures ===
{{See also|probability distribution|harmonic analysis|Haar measure|Laplace transform|semigroup}}
Martin-L<U+00F6>f began publishing articles on probability on algebraic structures, particularly semigroups, a research program led by [http://www.dam.brown.edu/pattern/ug.html Ulf Grenander] at Stockholm University.<ref>

=== Finite-sample foundations of statistics: Model comparison ===
{{See also|Exponential family|Missing data|Expectation maximization method|Model selection|Sufficient statistic}}
In the 1970s, Per Martin-L<U+00F6>f made important contributions to statistical theory and inspired further research, especially by Scandinavian statisticians like Rolf Sundberg, Thomas H<U+00F6>glund, and Steffan Lauritzen. In this work, Martin-L<U+00F6>f's previous research on probability measures on semigroups led to a notion of "repetitive structure" and a novel treatment of sufficient statistics, in which one-parameter [[exponential family|exponential families]] were characterized. He provided a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] approach to [[model selection|nested]] [[statistical model]]s, using finite-sample principles. Before (and after) Martin-L<U+00F6>f, such nested models have often been tested using chi-square hypothesis tests, whose justifications are only asymptotic (and so irrelevant to real problems, which always have finite samples<ref>

Martin-L<U+00F6>f's student, Rolf Sundberg, developed a detailed analysis of the [[expectation-maximization]] [[EM algorithm|(EM) method]] for estimation using data from exponential families, especially with [[missing data]]. Sundberg credits a formula, later known as the Sundberg formula, to previous manuscripts of the Martin-L<U+00F6>f brothers, Per and [[Anders Martin-L<U+00F6>f|Anders]].<ref>

==Type theory==
From 1968 to '69 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Chicago]] where he met [[William Alvin Howard]] with whom he discussed issues related to the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]]. Martin-L<U+00F6>f's first draft article on type theory dates back to 1971.  This [[impredicative]] theory generalized [[Jean-Yves Girard|Girard's]] [[System F]]. However, this system turned out to be [[consistency proof|inconsistent]] due to [[Girard's paradox]] which was discovered by Girard when studying System U, an inconsistent extension of System F. This experience led Per Martin-L<U+00F6>f to develop the philosophical foundations of [[Intuitionistic type theory|type theory]], his ''meaning explanation'', a form of [[proof-theoretic semantics]], which justifies [[impredicative|predicative]] type theory as presented in his 1984 Bibliopolis book, and extended in a number of increasingly philosophical texts, such as his influential ''On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws''.

The 1984 type theory was extensional while the type theory presented in the book by Nordstr<U+00F6>m ''et al.'' in 1990, which was heavily influenced by his later ideas, was intensional and more amenable to being implemented on a computer.

Martin-L<U+00F6>f's intuitionistic type theory developed the notion of [[dependent type]]s and directly influenced the development of the [[calculus of constructions]] and the [[LF (logical framework)|logical framework LF]]. A number of popular computer-based proof systems are based on type theory, for example [[NuPRL]], LEGO, [[Coq]], ALF, [[Agda theorem prover|Agda]], [[Twelf]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]].
