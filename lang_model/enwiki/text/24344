The '''Delhi Sultanate''' ('''<U+062F><U+0644><U+06CC> <U+0633><U+0644><U+0637><U+0646><U+062A>'''), or '''Sultanat-e-Hind''' ('''<U+0633><U+0644><U+0637><U+0646><U+062A><U+0650> <U+0647><U+0646><U+062F>''') / '''Sultanat-e-Dilli''' ('''<U+0633><U+0644><U+0637><U+0646><U+062A><U+0650> <U+062F><U+0644><U+06CC>''') refers to the many [[Muslim]] dynasties that ruled in [[India (disambiguation)|India]] from 1206 to [[1526]]. Several [[Turkish peoples|Turkish]] and [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] dynasties ruled from Delhi: the [[Slave dynasty]] (1206-90), the [[Khilji dynasty]] (1290-1320), the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320-1413), the [[Sayyid dynasty]] (1414-51), and the [[Lodi dynasty]] (1451-1526). In 1526 the Delhi Sultanate was absorbed by the emerging [[Mughal Empire]].

During the last quarter of the twelfth century, [[Muhammad of Ghor]] invaded the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]], conquering in succession [[Ghazni]], [[Multan]], [[Sindh]], [[Lahore]], and [[Delhi]]. [[Qutb-ud-din Aibak]], one of his generals, proclaimed himself [[Sultan of Delhi]] and established the first dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, the Slave or Mamluk dynasty (''mamluk'' means "slave born to free parents") after Muhammad's death in [[1206]]. The territory under control of the Sultans expanded rapidly. By mid-century, northern India from the [[Khyber Pass]] to [[Bengal]] was under control of the Sultanate, although the northwest was contested with the [[Mongols]]. [[Iltutmish]] (1210-35), and [[Balban]] (1266-87) were among the dynasty's most well-known rulers. Faced with revolts by conquered territories and rival families, the Mamluk dynasty came to an end in [[1290]].

The Khilji or Khalji dynasty, who had established themselves as rulers of [[Bengal]] in the time of Muhammad Ghori, took control of the empire in a coup which eliminated the last of the Mamluks. The Khiljis conquered [[Gujarat]] and [[Malwa]], and sent the first expeditions south of the [[Narmada River]], as far south as [[Tamil Nadu]]. The Delhi Sultanate rule continued to extend into southern India, first by the Delhi Sultans, then by the breakaway [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of [[Gulbarga]], and, after the breakup of the Bahmani state in [[1518]], by the five independent [[Deccan Sultanates]]. The [[Vijayanagara empire|kingdom of Vijayanagar]] united southern India and arrested the Delhi Sultanate's expansion for a time, until its eventual fall to the Deccan Sultanates in [[1565]].

In the first half of the 14th century the Sultanate introduced a [[Economic system|monetary economy]] in the provinces (''sarkars'') and districts (''parganas'') that had been established and founded a network of market centers through which the traditional village economies were both exploited and stimulated and drawn into the wider culture. State revenues remained based on successful agriculture, which induced Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] (1325-51) to have village wells dug, offer seed to the peasants and to encourage cash crops like [[sugar cane]] (Braudel 1984, pp 96f, 512ff). 

The Delhi Sultanate is the only Sultanate to stake a claim to possessing one of the few female rulers in India, [[Razia Sultana]] (1236-1240). While her reign was unfortunately short she is regarded well in the eyes of historians. The Princess [[Razia Sultana]] was very popular and more intelligent than her brothers. She was the very first queen of the Muslim world in the early Muslim history of sub-continent. She ruled from the east [[Delhi]] to the west [[Peshawar]] and from the North [[Kashmir]] to the South [[Multan]]. The Rebels of her Government killed her and her Husband [[Malik]] [[Altuniya]], and buried them outside Delhi.

The Sultans of Delhi enjoyed cordial, if superficial, relations with other Muslim rulers in the Near East but owed them no allegiance. The Sultans based their laws on the [[Qur'an]] and the [[sharia]] and permitted non-Muslim subjects to practice their religion only if they paid [[jizya]] or head tax. The Sultans ruled from urban centers--while military camps and trading posts provided the nuclei for towns that sprang up in the countryside. Perhaps the greatest contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating the subcontinent from the potential devastation of the Mongol invasion from [[Central Asia]] in the thirteenth century. 

The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting "Indo-Muslim" fusion left lasting monuments in architecture, music, literature, and religion. The Sultanate suffered from the sacking of Delhi in 1398 by Timur ([[Tamerlane]]), and soon other independent Sultanates were established in [[Awadh]], [[Bengal]], [[Jaunpur]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Malwa]]. The Delhi Sultanate revived briefly under the Lodhis before it was conquered by the [[Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]] in [[1526]].
