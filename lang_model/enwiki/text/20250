==Field trial program==
[[File:MINI E WAS 2010 9057.JPG||right|thumb|Rear view of the Mini E.]]
[[File:BMW Concept Active E WAS 2010 9062.JPG|thumb|The Mini E trial will be followed by the field testing of the [[BMW Concept ActiveE|BMW Active E]] in 2011.]]
The field testing of the Mini E is part of BMW's "Project i", which will be followed in mid 2011 by a similar trial with the [[BMW Concept ActiveE|BMW Active E]] [[all-electric vehicle]] which will accommodate seats for four adults and cargo. The Active E is based on the [[BMW 1 Series]] Coupe and will be built based on the lessons learned from the Mini E field testing. The last phase of "Project i" is the development of the [[BMW Mega-City|Mega-City]] electric car, a new brand that will be sold separately from BMW or Mini, and is expected to go into [[mass production]] between 2013 and 2015.<ref name=Wards0510/><ref name=AutoMag2010/><ref name=Edmunds0510/><ref name=Examiner0510>{{cite web|title=BMW's Project i: From Mini E to ActiveE to Mega-City|author=John Matras|publisher=Examiner.com|date=2005-05-18|accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> The field testing of the Active E will include fewer than 1000 cars and will be conducted in Los Angeles  and New York, but BMW is also considering expansion to other areas.<ref name=Wards0510/><ref name=AutoMag2010/>

===Field test experience===
The main concerns reported by some of the users participating in the U.S. field test is range anxiety and lack of public charging infrastructure, as the country has only 734 public charging stations, and most of them are located in [[California]].<ref name=WP122409/><ref name=Edmunds0909/><ref name=NYT032510/> Another concern reported is that the already restrictive {{Convert|100|mi|km|sing=on}} range on a fully charged battery reduces to between 80 to {{Convert|90|mi|km}} during very cold weather.<ref name=WP122409/><ref name=NYT032510>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/automobiles/autoreviews/28MINI.html?scp=1&sq=Mini%20E&st=cse|title=Gas-Pump Freedom (Restrictions Apply)|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Lawrence Ulrich|date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> In the [[UK]], an abnormally harsh winter also showed how very low temperatures diminishes power output until the battery is <U+2018>warmed-up<U+2019> once in use.<ref name=JustAuto0610/>  There was even one report of the range dropping below {{Convert|40|mi|km}} in sub-zero weather.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10138911.stm|title=What is it like to live with an electric car?|author=Jorn Madslien|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2010-06-03|accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> There have also been issues with exterior charging points as winter temperatures drop dramatically.<ref name=JustAuto0610/>

Other complaints in the U.S. relate to the lack of space in the car as the battery pack eliminates the Mini<U+2019>s back seat and most of its cargo area,<ref name=NYT032510/><ref name=NYT031910>{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/bmw-preaches-sustainability-in-munich-and-new-york/?scp=4&sq=Mini%20E&st=cse|title=BMW Preaches Sustainability in Munich and New York|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Stephen Williams|date=2010-03-19|accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> and the difficulties found in practice to install the charging equipment in homes, which took longer than anticipated, as just getting the installation permit in the U.S., including site visits and inspections can take up to a month.<ref name=NYT031910/><ref name=NYT031610>{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/home-charging-for-electric-vehicle-costs-will-vary/?scp=6&sq=Mini%20E&st=cse|title=Home Charging for Electric Vehicle: Costs Will Vary|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Jim Motavalli|date=2010-03-16|accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref>

==Specifications==
Power comes from an [[asynchronous motor|Asynchronous]] [[electric motor]] that is mounted in the former engine bay and is rated at {{convert|204|PS|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. Drive is sent to the front wheels. The Mini E employs a [[lithium-ion]] battery pack with an overall capacity of a {{convert|35|kWh}}.  The batteries weigh {{convert|572|lb|kg}} and replace the back seat.<ref>{{cite journal| last =Taylor III| first = Alex| title =Bavaria's Next Top Model| journal = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]| volume = 159 | issue = 6| page = 102| date = March 30, 2009 }}</ref>  Top speed is electronically limited to {{Convert|95|mph|abbr=on}}. The car<U+2019>s range is {{Convert|156|mi|km}} on a single charge under optimal conditions. Estimates of normal driving conditions put ranges at {{Convert|109|mi|km}} city and {{Convert|96|mi|km}} highway.<ref>[http://www.miniusa.com/minie-usa/pdf/MINI-E-spec-sheet.pdf MINI USA spec sheet (PDF)]</ref>

==AC Propulsion==
[[File:Mini E under the hood.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mini E under the hood]]
[[AC Propulsion]] issued a news release on November 19, 2008, stating that AC Propulsion is a supplier for Mini E.<ref>[http://www.acpropulsion.com/press_releases/ACP_Powers_MINI_E.pdf Press release from AC Propulsion]</ref>  The news release states that AC Propulsion supplies a specially-developed version of its proprietary [[AC Propulsion tzero|tzero]], a registered [[trademark]], technology, including air-cooled copper-rotor [[induction motor]] and [[Li ion battery]] on the Mini E. It is characterized by high performance, high efficiency, and fast charging.

==Driving characteristics==
The acceleration is via [[drive-by-wire]] technology.  A [[software]] mediated delay makes the vehicle hesitate a little when the acceleration pedal is first pressed.  This artificially limits the electric motor's response, preventing [[Burnout (vehicle)|burnout]] from a standstill.  After this initial delay, response goes back to normal, making the Mini E a peppy little car.

Its [[regenerative braking]] is designed to capture as much kinetic energy as possible giving the Mini E a distinct driving characteristic.  Once the driver's right foot leaves the acceleration pedal, the Mini E starts full regenerative braking.  The vehicle slows down significantly as if the brake pedal were pressed and the brake lights will turn on.  On level surfaces Mini E stops completely and the brake lights will turn off.  To slow down, one may just back off the acceleration pedal a little.  Use of the brake pedal may be reserved for emergencies and quick stops.

==Charging==
The Mini E can be charged through 120-volt (at 12 amp) and 240-volt (at 32 or 48 amp) power sources, and correspondingly, charging times are 20 hours and 3.5 hours (fast-charge system).<ref name=Edmunds0909>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2009/09/bmw-learing-lessons-from-mini-e-test---pay-attention-to-infrastructure-is-big-one.html|title=BMW Learing Lessons From Mini E Tes|author=John O'Dell|publisher=[[Edmunds]]|year=2009|month=September|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref> The user must set the correct charge rate using the instrument panel before beginning charging.  Detailed instructions are in the user's manual.

==Alternative electric Mini==
Nevada<U+2019>s [[Hybrid Technologies]] has started production of its electric-powered BMW Mini Cooper all-lithium model. The new electric Mini uses Hybrid Tech<U+2019>s own proprietary advanced lithium management and battery-balancing system.  Top speed is only around {{Convert|80|mph|abbr=on}} but driving at a slower speed preserves battery-life and means owners will be able to travel up to {{Convert|120|mi|km}} on a single charge. <ref>{{cite web|author=James&nbsp;Martinez |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/all-lithium-electric-mini-cooper-enters-production.html |title=All-lithium electric Mini Cooper enters production |publisher=MotorAuthority |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

EVTV.ME has published a free "how-to" series of videos documenting their conversion of a '''2009 Mini Cooper Clubman''' to electric drive.<ref>[http://web.me.com/mjrickard/ EVTV.ME Electric car conversion videos]</ref>  The project uses a more powerful AC induction motor from MES-DEA and TIMS600 controller to provide {{Convert|177|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.  It uses 112 readily available Sky Energy 100Ah LiFePo4 cells to provide an energy storage of 40.3 kWh and a range of {{Convert|125|mi|km}}.  Top speed of {{Convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  This is an open source project using parts readily available to anyone from existing suppliers and intended for those inclined to do their own conversion of an existing 2009 Mini Cooper Clubman.
