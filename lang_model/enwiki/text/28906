'''Tak'alik A'baj'''' ([[English language|English]]: {{IPA|[taka'li:k a'bah]}} [[K'iche' language|K'ichee']]: {{pron|tak<U+02C0>a'lik a'<U+0253>ax|Takalik Abaj pronunciation.ogg}}) is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] site in [[Guatemala]]; it was formerly known as '''Abaj Takalik'''. It is one of several [[Mesoamerica]]n sites with both [[Olmec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] features.  The site flourished in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] and [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic]] periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important [[Trade in Maya civilization|centre of commerce]],<ref>Love 2007, p.297. Popenoe de Hatch 2005, pp.992, 994.</ref> trading with [[Kaminaljuyu]] and [[Chocol<U+00E1>]]. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with [[monumental sculpture|sculptured monuments]] on the Pacific coastal plain.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.236.</ref> Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, [[petroglyph]]s and others.<ref name="Love2007p288">Love 2007, p.288.</ref> The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="Love2007p288"/>

Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.33.</ref> The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions]] that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental [[Maya architecture|architecture]] and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.<ref name="Adams96p81">Adams 1996, p.81.</ref>

Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]] and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies.<ref name="PH&SL2001p993-4">Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.993&ndash;4.</ref> Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance [[trade in Maya civilization|Maya trade routes]] that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the [[Guatemalan highlands]] and the Pacific coastal plain from [[Mexico]] to [[El Salvador]].

Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal [[Mesoamerican architecture|architecture]] clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1006, 1009.</ref> The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.

==Etymology==
''Tak'alik A'baj<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' means "standing stone" in the local [[K'iche' language|K'iche' Maya language]], combining the adjective ''tak<U+2019>alik'' meaning "standing", and the noun ''ab<U+00E4>j'' meaning "stone" or "rock".<ref>Christenson; Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.</ref> It was initially named ''Abaj Takalik'' by the American archaeologist [[Suzanna Miles]],<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26. Note that Miles's first name is given variously as Suzanna (Kelly 1996, p.215.), Susanna (Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.) and Susan (Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.)</ref> using Spanish word order. This was grammatically incorrect in K'iche';<ref name="CassierIchon26">Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.</ref> the Guatemalan government has now officially corrected this to ''Tak'alik A'baj'''. The ancient name of the site is as yet unknown.

==Location==
[[Image:Larger Southern Maya area v3.svg|left|thumb|350px|alt=Takalik Abaj is located in the middle of the Southern Maya Area. The landmass is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, with Takalik Abaj lying near the Pacific Ocean.|Takalik Abaj with relation to the Olmec heartland]]
The site lies in the southwest of [[Guatemala]], about 45&nbsp;km (28 miles) from the border with Mexico<ref name="Sharer467">Sharer 2000, p.467.</ref><ref name="SharerTraxler239">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> and 40&nbsp;km (25 miles) from the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="CassierIchon24">Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref>

Takalik Abaj is located in the north of the municipality of [[El Asintal]], in the extreme north of the [[Retalhuleu Department]] of Guatemala, some 120 miles (190&nbsp;km) from [[Guatemala City]].<ref>Zetina Aldana & Escobar 1994, p.3. Kelly 1996, p.210. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref>  The site lies among five coffee plantations in the lower foothills of the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] mountains; the Santa Margarita, San Isidro Piedra Parada, Buenos Aires, San El<U+00ED>as and Dolores plantations.<ref name="ZetinaEscobar3CassierIchon24">Zetina Aldana & Escobar 1994, p.3. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref> Takalik Abaj sits upon a ridge running north-south, descending in a southwards direction.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> This ridge is bordered on the west by the river [[Nim<U+00E1> River|Nim<U+00E1>]] and on the east by the river [[Ixchay<U+00E1> River|Ixchay<U+00E1>]], both flowing down from the [[Guatemalan Highlands]].<ref>Zetina Aldana & Escobar 1994, p.3.</ref> The Ixchay<U+00E1> flows in a deep ravine but a suitable crossing point is located near to the site. The situation of Takalik Abaj at this crossing point was probably important in the founding of the city, since this channeled important trade routes through the site and controlled access to them.<ref name="PH&SL991">Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref>

Takalik Abaj sits at an altitude of approximately {{convert|600|m|ft}} above sea level in an [[ecological region]] classed as [[subtropical moist forest]].<ref>Zetina Aldana & Escobar 1994, p.3. Rizzo de Robles 1991, p.32.</ref> The temperature normally varies between 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and 25&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F and 77&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and the [[Evapotranspiration#Potential_evapotranspiration|potential evapotranspiration ratio]] averages 0.45.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.171.</ref> The area receives high annual rainfall, varying between {{convert|2136|and|4372|mm|in|0}}, with an average annual rainfall of {{convert|3284|mm|in|0}}.<ref>Zetina Aldana & Escobar 1994, p.18.</ref> Local vegetation includes the Pascua de Monta<U+00F1>a (''Pogonopus spesiosus''), Chichique (''Aspidosperma megalocarpum''), Tepecaulote (''Leuhea speciosa''), Caulote or West Indian Elm (''Guazuma ulminofolia''), Hormigo (''Platymiscium dimorphandrum''), [[Mexican Cedar]] (''Cedrela mexicana''), [[Brosimum alicastrum|Breadnut]] (''Brosimum'' sp.), [[Tamarind]] (''Tamarindus indica'') and Papaturria (''Coccoloba montana'').<ref>Rizzo de Robles 1991, p.33.</ref>

A road, denominated 6W, passes the site running {{convert|30|km|mi}} from the town of [[Retalhuleu]] to [[Colomba|Colomba Costa Cuca]] in the department of [[Quetzaltenango (department)|Quetzaltenango]].<ref name="ZetinaEscobar3CassierIchon24"/>

Takalik Abaj is located at an approximate distance of {{convert|100|km|mi}} from the contemporary archaeological site of [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]], 130&nbsp;km (81 miles) from [[Kaminaljuyu]] and {{convert|60|km|mi}} from [[Izapa]] in Mexico.<ref name="CassierIchon24"/>

==Ethnicity==
[[Image:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|right|thumb|350px|alt=Takalik Abaj is situated immediately south of an area of higher terrain, with a wide flat coastal plain to the south. The landmass is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the southwest.|Takalik Abaj and other Preclassic sites on the Pacific coast]]
The changing styles of architecture and iconography at Tak'alik Abaj suggest that the site has been occupied by changing ethnic groups. The archaeological finds of the Middle Preclassic period suggest that the population of Takalik Abaj may have been affiliated with the [[Olmec]] culture of the [[Olmec heartland|Gulf Coast lowlands region]] who are thought to have been speakers of a [[Mixe-Zoque languages|Mixe-Zoquean language]].<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/><ref name="PH&SL991"/> In the Late Preclassic period Olmec art styles were exchanged for Maya styles and presumably this shift was accompanied by an influx of ethnic Maya, speaking a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]].<ref name="PH05p996">Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.996.</ref> There are some hints from the indigenous chronicles that the inhabitants of the site may have been the Yoc Cancheb, a branch of the [[Mam people|Mam]] Maya.<ref name="PH05p996"/>

==Economy and trade==
Takalik Abaj was one of a series of early sites on or near the [[Soconusco|Pacific coastal plain]] that were important commercial, ceremonial and political centres. It is apparent that it prospered from the production of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and from the [[trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] that crossed the region.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.455.</ref> At the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]] in the 16th century the area was still important for its cacao production.<ref>Coe 1999, p.64.</ref>

Study of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] recovered at Takalik Abaj indicates that the majority originated from the [[El Chayal]] and [[San Mart<U+00ED>n Jilotepeque]] sources in the Guatemalan highlands. Lesser quantities of obsidian originated from other sources such as [[Tajumulco]], [[Ixtepeque]] and [[Pachuca]].<ref name="Crasborn696">Crasborn 2005, p.696.</ref> Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass that was used across Mesoamerica to make durable tools and weapons including knives, spearheads, arrowheads, [[bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletters]] for ritual [[sacrifice in Maya culture|autosacrifice]], [[prismatic blade]]s for woodwork and many other day-to-day tools. The use of obsidian by the Maya has been likened to steel use in the modern world and it was widely traded throughout the Maya region and beyond.<ref>Coe 1999, p.30. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.37.</ref> The proportion of obsidian from different sources varied over time:

==History==
{{Maya civilization}}
The site had a long and continuous settlement history, with the period of principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic down to the Postclassic. The earliest known occupation at Takalik Abaj dates towards the end of the Early Preclassic, ca. 1000 BC. However it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that its first real florescence began with a noted surge in architectural constructions.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> From this period onwards a continuity of culture and population settlement is in evidence, as represented by the persistence of a local ceramic style (called ''Ocosito'') that remained in use until the Late Classic. The Ocosito style was typically made with red paste and [[pumice]] and extended westwards at least as far as [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]], southwards to the [[Ocosito River]] and eastwards to the [[Samal<U+00E1> River]]. By the Terminal Classic, pottery associated with a highland [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] ceramic style had begun to appear intermixed with Ocosito ceramic complex deposits. Ocosito ceramics were replaced entirely by the K'iche' ceramic tradition by the Early Postclassic period.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, pp.992&ndash;3.

===Early Preclassic===
Takalik Abaj was first occupied at the end of the Early Preclassic period.<ref>Crasborn 2005, p.696. Popenoe de Hatch 2004, p.415.</ref> The remains of an Early Preclassic residential area have been found to the west of the Central Group, on the bank of the El Chorro stream. These first houses were built with floors made from river cobbles and reed-thatched roofs supported on timber poles.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, pp.405, 411.</ref> [[Pollen analysis]] has revealed that the first inhabitants entered the area when it was still thick forest, which they began to clear in order to cultivate [[maize]] and other plants.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2004, p.424.</ref> Over 150 pieces of obsidian have been recovered from this area, known as El Escondite, mostly originating from the San Mart<U+00ED>n Jilotepeque and El Chayal sources.<ref name="Crasborn696"/>

===Middle Preclassic===
Takalik Abaj was reoccupied at the beginning of the Middle Preclassic.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> This was probably by [[Mixe-Zoque languages|Mixe-Zoquean]] inhabitants, as evidenced by the plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/><ref name="PH&SL991"/> The construction of public architecture had probably begun by the Middle Preclassic;<ref name="Love2007p288"/> the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> Ceramics from this period belonged to the local Ocosito tradition.<ref name="Love2007p288"/> This ceramic tradition, although it was local, showed strong affinities with the ceramics of the coastal plain and foothills of the [[Escuintla (department)|Escuintla]] region.<ref name="PH&SL991"/>

===Late Preclassic===
[[Image:Abaj Takalik Stela 5.jpg|right|alt=Line drawing of a stela, showing two ornate figures on either side of a double column of hieroglyphs|thumb|[[Stela]] 5 from Takal'ik Ab'aj. The latest of the two [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] dates is equivalent to a date in AD 126. The dates are flanked by rulers, probably symbolising the passing of power from one king to the next.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.468. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref>  Click [[:File:Takalik Abaj Stela 5.JPG|here]] for a photo of this stela.]]

During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] (300 BC &ndash; AD 200) various sites in the Pacific coastal region developed into true cities; Takalik Abaj was one of these, with an area greater than {{convert|4|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>Love 2007, pp.291&ndash;2.</ref> The cessation of [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures|Olmec influence]] upon the Pacific coastal zone occurred at the beginning of the Late Preclassic.<ref name="PH&SL991"/> At this time Takalik Abaj emerged as an important centre with an apparently local style of art and architecture;<ref>Miller 2001, p.59.</ref> the inhabitants began to make boulder sculptures and to erect stelae and associated altars.<ref>Miller 2001, pp.61&ndash;2.</ref> Monuments were erected with both political and religious significance, some of which bore Maya-style dates and depictions of rulers.<ref>Adams 2000, p.31.</ref> These early Maya monuments are carved with what may be among the earliest Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions and use of the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]].<ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref> The so-called [[Potbelly sculpture|potbelly]] style of sculpture also appeared at this time.<ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref> The appearance of Maya sculpture and the cessation of Olmec-style sculpture may represent a Maya intrusion into the area previously occupied by Mixe-Zoquean inhabitants.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/><ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref> One possibility holds that Maya elites entered the area in order to take control of the cacao trade.<ref name="Love293"/> However, given the evident continuity in local ceramic styles from the Middle to Late Preclassic, the change in attributes from Olmec to Maya may have been more an ideological than a physical transition.<ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref> If they ''had'' arrived from elsewhere, the finds of Maya stelae and a Maya royal tomb suggest that the Maya were in a dominant position, whether they arrived as traders or conquerors.<ref>Love 2007, p.297.</ref>

There is evidence of increasing contact with [[Kaminaljuyu]], which emerged as a principal centre at this time, linking the Pacific coastal trade routes with the [[Motagua River]] route, as well as increased contact with other sites along the Pacific coast.<ref>Love 2007, pp.293, 297. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref> Within this extended trade route, Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu appear to have been the two principal foci.<ref name="PH&SL991"/> The early Maya style of sculpture spread throughout this network.<ref name="OC&SL788">Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref>

During the Late Preclassic structures were built using volcanic stone held together with clay, as in the Middle Preclassic.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles.<ref name="OC&SL788"/>

Although the Ocosito ceramic tradition continued in use,<ref name="OC&SL788"/> the Late Preclassic ceramics in Takalik Abaj were strongly related to the Miraflores Ceramic Sphere that included Escuintla, the [[Valley of Guatemala]] and western [[El Salvador]].<ref name="PH&SL991"/> This ceramic tradition consists of fine red wares that are particularly associated with Kaminaljuyu and are found throughout the southeastern Guatemalan highlands and the adjacent Pacific slope.<ref>Neff et al 1988, p.345.</ref>

===Early Classic===
In the Early Classic, from around the second century AD, the stela style that developed at Takalik Abaj and was associated with the portrayal of historic figures was adopted across the Maya lowlands, particularly in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin]].<ref>Miller 2001, pp.64&ndash;5.</ref> During this period some of the pre-existing monuments were deliberately destroyed.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref>

In this period, the ceramics showed a change with the entry of the highland Solano style,<ref name="PH&SL993">Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref> This ceramic tradition is most associated with the Solano site in the southeastern Valley of Guatemala and the most characteristic type is a brick-red ware covered with a bright orange [[mica|micaceous]] [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], sometimes painted with pink or purple decoration.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 1987, p.158.</ref> This style of ceramics has been associated with the highland K'iche' Maya.<ref name="PH05p996"/> These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.<ref name="PH&SL993"/>

Archaeological investigations have shown that the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the distant [[Valley of Mexico]].<ref name="PH&SL993"/> The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the [[Suchiate River|Suchiate]] and [[Nahualate River|Nahualate]] rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel marks, and usually coated with a white or yellow [[Wash (painting)|wash]].<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 1987, p.154.</ref> At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments in the second half of the Early Classic.<ref name="PH&SL993"/> The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.<ref name="PH&SL2001p993-4"/>

The conquest of Takalik Abaj broke the ancient trade routes running along the Pacific coast from Mexico to El Salvador, these were replaced by a new route running up the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] and into the northwestern Guatemalan highlands.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.992.</ref>

===Late Classic===
[[Image:TakalikAbajStructure12.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A low, wide structure with stepped sides, with the top covered in low grass. A dense treeline forms the backdrop to the structure. The right hand side of the structure has several standing stones before it, with a local guide standing by one of them. |Structure 12, dating to the Early Classic<ref name="Kelly212">Kelly 1996, p.212.</ref>]]

In the Late Classic the site appears to have recovered from its earlier defeat. Naranjo-style ceramics diminished greatly in quantity and there was a surge in new large-scale construction. Many monuments broken by the conquerors were re-erected at this time.<ref name="PH&SL994">Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.994</ref>

===Postclassic===
Although use of the local Ocosito-style ceramics continued, there was a marked intrusion of K'iche' ceramics from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated particularly in the northern part of the site but extending to cover the whole.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.994. Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.993.</ref> The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, suggesting that the presence of their ceramics is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.<ref name="PH&SL994"/>

The K'iche' conquest appears to have taken place around AD 1000, some four centuries earlier than had been supposed using calculations based on the indigenous accounts.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, pp.992, 994.</ref> After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.993.</ref> This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.<ref name="PH05p997"/>

===Modern history===
The first published account appeared in 1888, written by Gustav Bruhl.<ref name="Kelly215">Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> The German ethnologist and naturalist [[Karl Sapper]] described Stela&nbsp;1 in 1894 after he saw it beside the road he was travelling.<ref name="Kelly215">Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> Max Vollmberg, a German artist, drew Stela 1 and noted some other monuments, which attracted the interest of Walter Lehmann.<ref name="Kelly215">Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref>

In 1902 the eruption of the nearby [[Santa Mar<U+00ED>a (volcano)|Santiaguito]] volcano covered the site in a layer of volcanic ash that varies between {{convert|40|and|50|cm|in}} thick.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.172.</ref>

Walter Lehmann began the study of the sculptures of Takalik Abaj in the 1920s.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/> In January 1942 [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] visited the site with Ralph L. Roys and William Webb on behalf of the [[Carnegie Institution]] while undertaking a study of the Pacific Coast,<ref name="CassierIchon26"/> publishing his accounts in 1943.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/> Further investigations were undertaken by Suzanna Miles, Lee Parsons and Edwin Shook.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/> Miles bestowed the name Abaj Takalik to the site, which appeared in her contributed chapter in volume&nbsp;2 of the ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'' published 1965.  Previously it had been known by various names, including San Isidro Piedra Parada and Santa Margarita, after the names of the plantations in which the site lies, and also by the name of [[Colomba]], a village to the north in the department of [[Quetzaltenango department|Quetzaltenango]].<ref name="Kelly215">Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref>

Excavations at the site in the 1970s were sponsored by the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/> They began in 1976 and were undertaken by John A. Graham, Robert F.

==Site description and layout==
[[Image:TakalikAbajDrainage.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A stone-lined channel set into a grassy embankment. The sides of the channel are formed by upright stones and parts of the channel are covered with capstones.|Stone channel to carry runoff from the major architecture. This example is by Structure&nbsp;7 and dates to the Late Classic.<ref>Love 2007, p.293. Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, p.958.</ref>]]
The core of the site covers about {{convert|6.5|km2|mi2}}<ref name="Wolley365">Wolley Schwarz 2002, p.365.</ref> and includes remains of some 70 monumental structures positioned around a dozen plazas.<ref name="Wolley365"/><ref name="WolleySchwarz1006">Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1006.</ref> Takalik Abaj has 2 [[Mesoamerican ballcourts|ballcourts]] and over 239 known stone monuments,<ref name="Wolley365"/> including impressive stelae and altars. The granite used to make monuments in [[Olmec]] and early Maya styles is much different from the soft limestone used in the Pet<U+00E9>n cities.<ref>Tarpy 2004.</ref> The site is also noted for its hydraulic systems, including a ''[[temazcal]]'' or sauna bath with a subterranean drainage, and Preclassic tombs found in excavations from the late 1990s onwards by Drs. Marion Popenoe de Hatch, Christa Schieber de Lavarreda and Miguel Orrego, from the [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]].

The structures at Takalik Abaj are spread among four groups; the Central, North and West Groups are clustered together but the South Group is located about 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;miles) to the south.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> The site is naturally defensible, being bordered by steep ravines.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1006"/> The site is spread over a series of nine terraces, which vary in width from {{convert|140|to|220|m|ft}} and have faces varying in height from {{convert|4.6|to|9.4|m|ft}}.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1006"/> These terraces are not uniformly oriented, instead the direction of their retaining faces depends upon the lie of the local terrain.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1006"/> The three main terraces supporting the city are artificial, with over {{convert|10|m|ft}} of [[fill (archaeology)|fill]] being used in places.<ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref>

When Takalik Abaj was at its greatest extent, major architecture in the city covered an area of approximately {{convert|2|by|4|km|mi}}, although the area occupied by residential construction has not been determined.<ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref>

*The '''Central Group''' occupies Terraces&nbsp;1 to 5, which were artificially levelled. The group contains 39 structures arranged around plazas that are open on the north and south sides. The Central Group was first occupied in the Middle Preclassic and contains a concentration of more than 100 stone monuments.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007">Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref><ref name="SL&P04p410">Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref><ref name="CrasbornMarroqu<U+00ED>n49">Crasborn & Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2006, pp.49-50.</ref>

*The '''West Group''' consists of 21 structures on Terrace&nbsp;6, which was also artificially levelled. The structures are arranged around plazas that were left open on the east side. Seven monuments have been found in this group. The West Group is bordered by the rivers Nima on the west and the San Isidro on the east. A notable find in the West Group was the discovery of some jade masks there. The West Group was occupied from the Late Preclassic through to at least the Late Classic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1007, 1010. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410. Crasborn & Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2006, p.49.</ref>

*The '''North Group''' was occupied from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1006&ndash;7.</ref> This group's structures were built using a different method from those in the Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/> The group occupies Terraces&nbsp;7 through 9, which follow the contours of the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/> In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic [[assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]]s associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably [[K'iche' Maya]] from the highlands.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/>

*The '''South Group''' is located outside the site core, some {{convert|0.5|km|mi}} south of the Central Group, about {{convert|2|km|mi}} west of El Asintal, it consists of 13 structure mounds forming a dispersed group.<ref name="WolleySchwarz02p371">Wolley Schwarz 2002, p.371. Crasborn & Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2006, p.49.</ref>

===Water control===
The hydraulic system included stone canals, which were not used for irrigation but rather to channel runoff and maintain the structural integrity of the principal architecture.<ref name="Love293">Love 2007, p.293.</ref> These channels were also used to carry water to the residential areas of the city,<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, p.955.</ref> and it is possible that the channels also served a ritual purpose linked to the rain god.<ref>Love 2007, p.293. Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, p.958.</ref> So far, the remains of 25 channels have been found at the site.<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, p.956.</ref> The larger channels measure {{convert|0.25|m|in|0}} wide by {{convert|0.30|m|in}} high, secondary channels measure about half that.<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, pp.956&ndash;7.</ref>

There are two methods of construction used for the water channels. Clay channels date from the Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. It is presumed that the clay channels were not sufficiently effective, thus leading to the switch in construction materials and the implementation of stone-lined channels. In the Late Classic pieces of broken stone monuments were reused in the construction of the water channels.<ref name="Marroqu<U+00ED>n957-8">Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, pp.957&ndash;8.</ref>

===Terraces===
[[Image:TakalikAbajView2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A flat grassy area dotted with widely-spaced trees. A wide stairway can just be glimpsed between the vegetation.|A plaza upon one of the terraces of Takalik Abaj]]
'''Terrace 2''' is in the Central Group.<ref name="SL&P04p410"/> Structures on this terrace date as far back as the Middle Preclassic and include an early example of a [[Mesoamerican ballcourts|ballcourt]].<ref name="SL94p73-4"/>

'''Terrace 3''' is in the Central Group.<ref name="SL&P04p410"/> The facade represented a major construction project and dates to the Late Preclassic.<ref name="Garc<U+00ED>a176"/>

'''Terrace 5''' is on the eastern side of the site immediately to the north of the Central Group. It measures {{convert|200|m|ft}} east to west and {{convert|300|m|ft}} north to south. Terrace&nbsp;5 is on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation and is currently used for the cultivation of coffee. The retaining face of the terrace was built of compacted clay during the Late Preclassic and represented an enormous inversion of labour. This terrace continued in use until the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1008&ndash;9. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

'''Terrace 6''' supports the 16 structures of the West Group. It measures {{convert|150|m|ft}} from east to west and {{convert|140|m|ft}} from north to south. The terrace shows various phases of construction, it overlies a substructure built from large worked blocks of [[basalt]] which dates to the Late Preclassic, later phases of construction date to the Late Classic and the terrace has traces of the Postclassic K'iche' occupation of the site. The terrace lies within the San Isidro Piedra Parada and Buenos Aires plantations and the land is currently dedicated to the cultivation of rubber and coffee. A modern road cuts the eastern corner of Terrace 6.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1010&ndash;11.</ref>

'''Terrace 7''' is a natural terrace that supports a part of the North Group. It runs east-west and is {{convert|475|m|ft}} long. It supports 15 structures dating from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic and associated with the K'iche' occupation of the site. This terrace lies between the Buenos Aires and San El<U+00ED>as plantations and the eastern part has been cut by a modern road.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/>

'''Terrace 8''' is another natural terrace in the North Group. It also runs east west and is {{convert|400|m|ft}} long. A modern road has cut the eastern part of the terrace and the western side of Structure&nbsp;46 upon its edge. The terrace supports only this structure and one other to the north (Structure&nbsp;54). The terrace was probably a residential area with cultivated land associated with the North Group. This terrace is associated with the K'iche' occupation of the site from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/>

'''Terrace 9''' is the largest terrace at Takalik Abaj and supports part of the North Group. It is approximately {{convert|400|m|ft}} running east-west and {{convert|300|m|ft}} from north to south. The retaining face of the terrace runs immediately to the north of the main North Group complex on the western half of Terrace&nbsp;7 for {{convert|200|m|ft}}, at the eastern extreme of this section it turns north above Terrace&nbsp;8 for {{convert|300|m|ft}} before changing to run another {{convert|200|m|ft}} east, limiting Terrace&nbsp;8 on its west and north sides. Terrace&nbsp;9 supports only two major structures (Structures&nbsp;66 and 67). A modern road cuts the eastern side of the Terrace&nbsp;9, excavations where the road has cut the terrace have revealed the possible remains of a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1007&ndash;8. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

===Structures===
{{double image|right|TakalikAbajBallcourtp2.jpg|180|TakalikAbajPavement.jpg|180|The ballcourt on Terrace&nbsp;2 in the Central Group, dating to the Middle Prelassic<ref name="SL94p73-4"/> |An excavated pavement adjacent to the ballcourt |Excavated area with a flat dusty area to the left with some rubble and with steeply sloping well-dressed stonework to the right sat on top of a low vertical stonework base. A ramshackle roof protecting the excavations is supported by wooden poles.|An area of excavation under a corrugated roof supported by wooden poles. The foreground shows an even cobbled pavement running diagonally from left front to right back, where it disappears into a vertical wall of partially excavated rubble and soil.}}

The '''Ballcourt''' is located in the southwest of Terrace&nbsp;2 and dates to the Middle Preclassic. It has a north-south alignment with the sides of the {{convert|4.6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide playing area formed by '''Structures&nbsp;Sub-2''' and '''Sub-4'''. The ballcourt is just over {{convert|22|m|ft}} long with a playing area of {{convert|105|m2|ft2}}. The southern limit of the ballcourt is formed by '''Structure&nbsp;Sub-1''', just over {{convert|11|m|ft}} to the south of Structures Sub-2 and Sub-4, creating a southern end-zone that runs east-west and measures {{convert|23|by|11|m|ft}} with a surface area of {{convert|264|m2|ft2}}.<ref name="SL94p73-4"/>

'''Structure 7''' is a large platform located to the east of the plaza on Terrace&nbsp;3 in the Central Group and is considered to have been one of the most sacred buildings at Takalik Abaj due to a series of important finds associated with it. Structure&nbsp;7 measures {{convert|79|by|112|m|ft}} and dates to the Middle Preclassic. Built upon the northern part of Structure&nbsp;7 are two smaller structures, designated as Structures&nbsp;7A and 7B.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784. Schieber de Lavarreda 2002, p.399.</ref> Structure&nbsp;7 supports three rows of monuments aligned north-south that may have served as an astronomical observatory.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2002, pp.378&ndash;80.</ref> Another important find in Structure&nbsp;7 was a Late Classic cylindrical incensario given the name "La Ni<U+00F1>a" by archaeologists due to its prominent female [[appliqu<U+00E9>]] figure. It dates to the earliest levels of K'iche' occupation of the site and is {{convert|50|cm|in}} high and {{convert|30|cm|in}} wide at the base. It was found together with a large quantity of other offerings including further ceramics and fragments of broken sculptures.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2005, pp.724&ndash;5. Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.997.</ref>

'''Structure 7A''' is a small structure sitting on top of the northern part of Structure&nbsp;7. It dates to the Middle Preclassic and has been excavated. The Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial&nbsp;1 was found in its centre. A large offering of hundreds of ceramic vessels was found in the base of the structure and is associated with the burial. Structure&nbsp;7A underwent substantial rebuilding in the Early Classic and was again modified in the Late Classic.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, pp.784, 787&ndash;8.</ref>

'''Structure 11''' has been excavated. It was covered with rounded boulders held together with clay.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> It is located to the west of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.<ref name="Kelly212"/>
[[Image:TakalikAbajView.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large grassy mound seen through widely spaced trees scattered across a flat grassy foreground. A stone stairway climbs the mound and several stone monuments stand in front of this stairway. More trees form the backdrop to the mound.|Structure&nbsp;11 and its associated monuments]]

'''Structure 12''' lies to the east of Structure&nbsp;11.<ref name="Kelly214">Kelly 1996, p.214.</ref> It has also been excavated and, like Structure&nbsp;11, it is covered with rounded boulders held together with clay.<ref name="Kelly210.">Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> It lies to the east of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.<ref name="Kelly212"/> The structure is a three-tiered platform with stairways on the east and west sides. The visible remains date to the Early Classic but they overlie Late Preclassic construction. A row of sculptures lines the west side of the structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar.<ref name="Kelly212"/> Further monuments line the east side, one of which may be the head of a [[crocodilia]]n, the others are plain. Sculpture&nbsp;69 is located on the south side of the structure.<ref name="Kelly214"/>

'''Structure 17''' is located in the South Group, on the Santa Margarita plantation. It contained a Late Preclassic cache of 13 prismatic obsidian blades.<ref>Crasborn 2005, pp.695, 698.</ref>

'''Structure 34''' is in the West Group, at the eastern corner of Terrace&nbsp;6.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1010">Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1010.</ref>

'''Structures 38''', '''39''', '''42''' and '''43''' are joined by low platforms on the east side of a plaza on Terrace&nbsp;7, aligned north-south. '''Structures&nbsp;40''', '''47''' and '''48''' are on south, west and north sides of this plaza. '''Structures&nbsp;49''', '''50''', '''51''', '''52''' and '''53''' form a small group on the west side of the terrace, bordered on the north by Terrace&nbsp;9. Structure&nbsp;42 is the tallest structure in the North Group, measuring about {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} high. All of these structures are mounds.<ref>Jacobo 1999, p.550. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

'''Structure 46''' is a mound at the edge of Terrace&nbsp;8 in the North Group and dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic. The west side of the structure has been cut by a modern road.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/>

'''Structure 54''' is built upon Terrace&nbsp;8, to the north of Structure&nbsp;46, in the North Group. It is surrounded by an open area without mounds that was probably a mixed residential and agricultural area. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1007"/>

'''Structure 57''' is a large mound at the southern limit of the Central Group with an excellent view across the coastal plain. The structure was built in the Late Preclassic and underwent a second phase of construction in the Late Classic. It may have served as a look-out point.<ref name="PH&SL993"/>
[[Image:Structure5.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A large grassy mound with a wide stone stairway climbing from the bottom centre toward the summit at top right. The mound has scattered trees around the stairway with increasingly thick vegetation toward the far side of the structure.|Structure&nbsp;5]]

'''Structure 61''', '''Mound&nbsp;61A''' and '''Mound&nbsp;61B''' are all on the east side of Terrace&nbsp;5, on the San Isidro plantation. Structure&nbsp;61 was built during the Early Classic and is dressed with stone, it was built upon an earlier construction dating to the Late Preclassic. Stela&nbsp;68 was found at the base of Mound&nbsp;61A near to a broken altar. Structure&nbsp;61 and its associated mounds may have been used to control access to the city during the height of its power, Mound&nbsp;61A was reused during the Postclassic occupation of the site. Early Classic finds from Mound&nbsp;61A include four ceramic vessels and four obsidian prismatic blades.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1008&ndash;9. Crasborn 2005, p.698.</ref>

'''Structure 66''' is located on Terrace&nbsp;9, at the northern extreme of the North Group. It had an excellent view across the entire city and may have served as a sentry post controlling access to the site. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1008">Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1008.</ref>

'''Structure 67''' is a large platform on Terrace&nbsp;9 that may have been associated with a possible residential area upon that terrace and located to the north of the North Group.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1008"/>

'''Structure 68''' is in the West Group. A part of the western side of the structure has been cut by a modern road. This has revealed a sequence of superimposed clay substructures dating to the Late Preclassic, the structure was then dressed with stone in the Early Classic.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1010"/>

'''North Ballcourt'''. The possible remains of a second ballcourt were found to the north of the North Group and may have been associated with the occupation of that group from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic. It was built from compacted clay and runs east-west, the North Structure was {{convert|2|m|ft}} tall and the South Structure had a height of {{convert|1|m|ft}}, the playing area was {{convert|10|m|ft}} wide.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1008"/>

===Stone monuments===
[[Image:Potbelly 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A small stone sculpture with a round featureless head and squat round body. The figure is seen from the front left and the left arm is visible, raised against the side of the figure's body. The arm descends from the shoulder and bends forwards at the elbow, running horizontally to the wrist, which bends sharply downwards, with the fingers marked by carved grooves. The sculpture has no legs and rests on a grassy area in front of some stone steps.|A potbelly sculpture at Takalik Abaj, probably dating to the Late Preclassic]]

More than 239 stone monuments have been found at Takalik Abaj, mostly carved from local [[andesite]] boulders.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2002, p.365. Benson 1996, p.23.</ref> These monuments are both plain and carved and are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups.<ref>Benson 1996, p.23. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.786.</ref> The worked monuments can be divided into four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).<ref name="OC&SL786">Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.786.</ref>

Most of the monuments at Takalik Abaj are not in their original positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons.<ref name="Sharer467"/>  An example is a series of four monuments found in a plaza in front of a Classic period platform, with at least two of the four (Altar&nbsp;12 and Monument&nbsp;23) dating to the Preclassic.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/>

There are several stelae sculpted in the early Maya style that bear hieroglyphic texts with [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] dates that place them in the Late Preclassic.<ref name="Sharer467"/> This style of sculpture is ancestral to the Classic style of the Maya lowlands.<ref name="Sharer468">Sharer 2000, p.468.</ref>

Takalik Abaj has various so-called Potbelly monuments representing obese human figures sculpted from large boulders, of a type found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico to [[El Salvador]]. Their precise function is unknown but they appear to date from the Late Preclassic.<ref>Sharer 2000, pp.476&ndash;7. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.30.</ref>

====Olmec style sculptures====
The many Olmec-style sculptures, including Monument&nbsp;23, a colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure,<ref>Graham 1989, p.232.</ref> seem to indicate a physical Olmec presence and control, possibly under an Olmec governor.<ref>Adams 1996, pp.73, 81.</ref> Archaeologist John Graham states that:

{{blockquote|Olmec sculpture at Abaj Takalik such as Monument&nbsp;23 clearly reflects the presence of Olmec sculptors who are working for Olmec patrons and creating Olmec art with Olmec content in the context of Olmec ritual.<ref>Graham 1989, p.235.</ref>}}

[[Image:Takalik Abaj Olmec sculpture 1.JPG|right|thumb|alt=A stone sculpture sitting in an excavated trench. The monument is damaged with deep fracturing towards the top. It lists to the left and is braced with wooden poles. A niche is carved into the front of the monument and contains a badly eroded seated figure holding a featureless bundle in its arms. |Monument&nbsp;23, an Olmec (or Olmec-influenced) sculpture at Takalik Abaj, showing a figure emerging from a cave, bearing an infant in its arms. Compare with [[La Venta#Altars 4 & 5|Altar&nbsp;5 at La Venta]]]]
Others are less sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common iconography of power on the Pacific and Gulf coasts.<ref name="Adams96p81"/> In any case, Takalik Abaj was certainly a place of importance for Olmecs.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.147. Graham has said that Takalik Abaj is the "most important Olmec site" known within Pacific Guatemala. (Graham 1989, p.231.)</ref> The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic.<ref name="OC&SL786"/> Except for Monuments&nbsp;1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.<ref name="OC&SL786"/>

====Maya style sculptures====
There are more than 30 monuments in the early Maya style, which dates to the Late Preclassic, making it the most common style represented at Takalik Abaj.<ref name="OC&SL788"/> The great quantity of early Maya sculpture and the presence of early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology.<ref name="OC&SL788"/> The origins of the Maya sculptural style may have developed in the Preclassic on the Pacific coast and Takalik Abaj's position at the nexus of key trade routes could have been important in the disemination of the style across the Maya area.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.468. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref> The early Maya style of monument at Takalik Abaj is closely linked to the style of monument at Kaminaljuyu, showing mutual influence. This interlinked style spread to other sites that formed part of the extended trade network of which these two cities were the twin foci.<ref name="OC&SL788"/>

====Potbelly style sculptures====
{{main|Potbelly sculpture}}
Sculptures of the Potbelly style are found all along the Pacific Coast from southern Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.791&ndash;2. Sharer 2000, pp.476&ndash;7.</ref> Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used at the end of the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic.<ref name="OC&SL791-2">Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.791&ndash;2.</ref> The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]] in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.<ref name="OC&SL791-2"/>
Potbelly sculptures are generally rough sculptures that show considerable variation in size and the position of the limbs.<ref name="OC&SL791-2"/> They depict obese human figures, usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.<ref name="OC&SL791-2"/>

====Local style sculptures====
Local style sculptures are generally boulders carved into zoomorphic shapes, including three-dimensional representations of frogs, toads and crocodilians.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.786, 792.</ref>

====Inventory of altars====
{{double image|right|TakalikAbajAltar28.jpg|180|TakalikAbajAltarPic2.jpg|180|Altar&nbsp;28, bearing the carving of a skull<ref name="Wolley 368">Wolley Schwarz 2002, p.368.</ref> |Altar&nbsp;30, embedded in the access stairway to Terrace&nbsp;3<ref name="Garc<U+00ED>a173,187"/> |An irregular disc-shaped stone lying flat, with some damage to the left hand side.

'''Altar 1''' is found at the base of Stela&nbsp;1, it is rectangular in shape with carved [[Molding (decorative)|molding]] on its side.<ref name="ChangLam19">Chang Lam 1991, p.19.</ref>

'''Altar 2''' is of unknown provenance, having been moved to outside the administrator's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is {{convert|1.59|m|in}} long, about {{convert|0.9|m|in}} wide and about {{convert|0.5|m|in}} high. It represents an animal variously identified as a toad and a jaguar. The body of the animal was sculptured to form a hollow {{convert|85|cm|in}} across and {{convert|26|cm|in}} deep. The sculpture was broken into three pieces.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.33, 44.</ref>

'''Altar 3''' is a roughly worked flat, circular altar about {{convert|1|m|in}} across and {{convert|0.3|m|in}} high.

'''Altar 9''' is a low four-legged throne placed in front of Structure&nbsp;11.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.173.</ref>

'''Altar 10''' was associated with Stela&nbsp;13 and was found on top of the large offering of ceramics associated with that stela and the royal tomb in Structure&nbsp;7A. The monument was originally a throne with cylindrical supports that was reused as an altar in the Classic period.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2002, pp.399&ndash;402. Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.791.</ref>

'''Altar 12''' is a Late Preclassic monument carved in the early Maya style.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/> Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.789&ndash;90, 800.</ref>

'''Altar 13''' is another early Maya monument dating to the Late Preclassic. Like Altar&nbsp;12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was delibrately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.790, 802.</ref>

'''Altar 28''' is located near Structure&nbsp;10 in the Central Group. It is a circular basalt altar just over {{convert|2|m|in}} in diameter and {{convert|0.5|m|in}} thick.

====Inventory of stelae====
[[Image:Stela18TakalikAbaj.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tall, narrow standing stone set in a grassy area with an overgrown mound in the background. A flat circular stone lays at the base of the standing stone, it has been carved into a rough cogwheel shape.|Stela&nbsp;18 and its associated altar]]
[[Stele|Stelae]] are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at Takalik Abaj follows:

'''Stela 1''' was found near to Stela&nbsp;2 and moved near to the administrator's house of the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is {{convert|1.36|m|in}} high, {{convert|0.72|m|in}} wide and {{convert|0.45|m|in}} thick. It bears the sculpture of a standing figure facing to the left, holding a sceptre in the form of a serpent with a dragon mask at the lower end, a feline is on top of the serpent's body. It is similar in style to Stela&nbsp;1 at [[El Ba<U+00FA>l]]. A badly eroded hieroglyphic text is to the left of the figure's face, which is now completely illegible. This stela is early Maya in style, dating to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.34. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.791, 805.</ref>

'''Stela 2''' is a monument in the early Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the first century BC.<ref name="Sharer467"/> Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor.<ref name="SharerTraxler248">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref> Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile looking down at the left-hand figure below.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.790, 803.</ref> Stela&nbsp;2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace&nbsp;5.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1008"/>

'''Stela 3''' is badly damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found somewhere on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.35, 42.</ref>

'''Stela 4''' was uncovered in 1969 and moved near to the administrator's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is of a style very similar to the stelae at Izapa and stands {{convert|1.37|m|in}} high.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.36, 41.</ref> The stela bears a complex design representing an undulating [[vision serpent]] rising toward the sky from the water flowing from two earth monsters, the jaws of the serpent are open wide towards the sky and from them emerges a characteristically Maya face. Several glyphs appear among the imagery. This stela is early Maya in style and dates to the Late Preclassic.<ref name="OC&SL788-9,799">Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.788&ndash;9, 799.</ref>

[[Image:Takalik Abaj Stela 5 p4.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A squat standing stone with a flat front face set against a low stone-faced mound structure at right. The face of standing stone is inscribed but the details are not visible. In front of the stone, at left, lies a flat circular stone, set upon a flat grassy area. Dense vegetation is visible in the background.|Stela&nbsp;5 and Altar&nbsp;8]]
'''Stela 5''' is reasonably well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest of these two dates is AD 126.<ref name="Sharer468"/> The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.790.</ref> This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next.<ref name="SharerTraxler248"/> A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at [[Izapa]].<ref>Kelly 1996, p.213.</ref>

'''Stela 12''' is located near Structure&nbsp;11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into fragments, of which two remain. The largest fragment is from the lower portion of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both facing in the same direction. They stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are the remains of a glyph that appears to be a number in the [[Maya numerals|bar-and-dot]] format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.<ref name="Kelly214"/>

'''Stela 13''' dates to the Late Preclassic. It is badly damaged, having been broken in two parts. It is carved in early Maya style and bears a design representing a stylised serpentine head, very similar to a monument found at Kaminaljuyu.<ref name="OC&SL788-9,799"/> Stela&nbsp;13 was erected at the base of the south side of Structure&nbsp;7A. At the base of the stela was found a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels, 33 [[prismatic blade|prismatic obsidian blades]], as well as other artifacts. The stela and the offering are associated with the Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial&nbsp;1.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784. Crasborn 2005, p.697.</ref>

'''Stela 14''' is on the eastern edge of Terrace&nbsp;3, in the Central Group. It is fashioned from [[andesite]] and has 27 cup-like depressions upon the surface. It is one of the few such monuments found within the ceremonial centre of the city.<ref name="Wolley373">Wolley Schwarz 2002, p.373.</ref>

'''Stela 29''' is a smooth andesite monument at the southeast corner of Structure&nbsp;11 with seven steps carved into its upper portion.<ref name="Wolley373"/>

'''Stela 66''' is a plain stela dating to the Late Preclassic. It is found in the West Group, on Terrace&nbsp;6.<ref name="WolleySchwarz1010"/>

'''Stela 68''' was found at the southeast corner of Mound&nbsp;61A on Terrace&nbsp;5. This stela was broken in two and the remaining fragments appear to belong to two separate monuments. The stela, or stelae, once bore early Maya sculpture but this appears to have been deliberately destroyed, leaving only a few sculptured symbols.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1009.</ref>

'''Stela 71''' is an early Maya carved fragment reused in the construction of a water channel by Structure&nbsp;7.<ref name="Marroqu<U+00ED>n957-8"/>

===Royal burial===
A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial.<ref name="SharerTraxler239"/> This tomb has been designated '''Burial&nbsp;1'''; it was found during excavations of Structure&nbsp;7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure.<ref name="SL03p784">Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784.</ref> The burial is also associated with Stela&nbsp;13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure&nbsp;7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic.<ref name="SL03p784"/> No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts.<ref name="SL03p788">Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.788.</ref> The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring {{convert|1|by|2|m|ft}}, which was probably made of wood and coated in red [[cinnabar]] dust.<ref name="SL03p788"/> Grave goods include an 18-piece [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] necklace, two [[earspool]]s coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from [[iron pyrite]], one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100&ndash;200.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, pp.790&ndash;1.</ref>
