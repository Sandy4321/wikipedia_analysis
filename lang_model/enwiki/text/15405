It focuses on life among the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jewish community in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel. [[Hadas Yaron]] stars as Shira Mendelman, an 18-year-old girl who is pressured to marry her deceased older sister's husband following the death of her sister in childbirth.<ref name="Variety">{{cite web| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948164/ |title=''Fill the Void (Lemale et ha'chalal)'' |accessdate=2012-09-12 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Yiftach Klein, Hila Feldman, Irit Sheleg, Chaim Sharir, Razia Israeli, Ido Samuel, and Renana Raz also star.

The film required a lengthy production period, taking over a year for the casting to be completed and another year and three months for editing. Burshtein, who was doubtful as to how much of the process would be completed, took a step-by-step approach, focusing first on the writing, then on accumulating enough funding for the project, followed by the filming and editing. Burshtein became the first [[Orthodox Jewish]] woman to direct a movie intended for wide distribution.<ref name="Dawson"/> The 90-minute ''Fill the Void'' premiered at the 69th [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 1, 2012<ref>{{cite web|first=Gabe|last=Fisher|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/two-israeli-films-to-get-world-premiere-at-venice-film-festival/|title=Two Israeli films to get world premiere at Venice festival|work=[[Times of Israel]]|date=July 1, 2012|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Anderman">{{cite web|first=Nirit|last=Anderman|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/venice-film-critics-wowed-by-ultra-orthodox-jewish-director-s-debut-1.462807|title=Venice film critics wowed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish director's debut |work=[[Ha'aretz]]|date=September 5, 2012|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> and was later released in the United States on May 24, 2013.<ref name="HR">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/fill-void|title=Fill the Void|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}</ref>

''Fill the Void'' was well received by critics for its depiction of Orthodox Jews and their lifestyle. It won seven [[Israeli Academy Awards]], and lead actress Hadas Yaron won Best Actress for her portrayal of Shira at the Venice Film Festival.<ref name="Miller"/>

==Plot==
Shira Mendelman (Hadas Yaron), an 18-year-old Haredi girl living in Tel Aviv, is looking forward to an arranged marriage with a young man whom she likes. However, on [[Purim]], her family suffers a tragedy when Shira's older sister Esther (Renana Raz) dies in childbirth. Shira's father subsequently delays the engagement so as not to have to deal with an empty house so soon after Esther's death. Esther's husband, Yochay (Yiftach Klein), begins to regularly bring their son, Mordechai, to the Mendelman's house, where Shira cares for him.

One day, Yochay's mother approaches Shira's mother, Rivka (Irit Sheleg), about the possibility of Yochay remarrying, believing it to be best for Mordechai. She plans to suggest an offer from a widow in Belgium. Rivka is distraught by the idea of Mordechai being taken out of the country and suggests that Yochay marry Shira instead. He and Shira both initially oppose the prospect, though he eventually warms to it and she agrees to take it into consideration on learning that her previous engagement has been called off due to her father's delays.

Shortly afterwards, Frieda (Hila Feldman), a friend of Esther's who has never received any marriage proposals, tells Shira that Esther would have preferred that Yochay marry her in the event of her death. As a result, Shira tells Yochay that Frieda is more suitable, which he takes as an affront.

Shira and Yochay remain distant from one another afterwards, and he announces that he plans to move with Mordechai to marry the widow in Belgium. Shira, pressured by her family, agrees to go forward with the engagement to Yochay, believing it to be the best scenario for everyone. However, the rabbi (Melech Thal) realizes that Shira is acting to please her family and refuses to condone the marriage.

Time passes, and Shira eventually grows to love Yochay of her own accord. She approaches the rabbi and asks again that she and Yochay be married, and he agrees this time. The film closes with their wedding.

===Writing and themes===
''Fill the Void'' was written and directed by Rama Burshtein,<ref name="Scott"/> who, in the course of its production, became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to direct a film intended to be viewed outside of the Orthodox community.<ref name="Dawson"/> In doing so, she hoped to create a greater understanding of the Orthodox community, in part by dispelling the common misconceptions that women are often forced into arranged marriages; despite the differences in structure, the woman is always given the final say in whom she marries.<ref name="Miller"/> Burshtein also deliberately avoided depicting a divide between the religious and secular [[Jew]]s, a theme that commonly appears in films about the Orthodox. She explained:

{{quote|As a people we are thousands of years old and we exist without that conflict of the secular and the religious. The truth is that most of us do not want to leave our communities. All of those films were always about someone either trying to get out or someone from the outside trying to get in and it was very important for me to say that we also just exist and feel and love and struggle and hurt by ourselves, not always because we're in conflict.<ref name="Miller">{{cite web|first=Danny|last=Miller|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/movies/blogs/blog--interview-director-rama-burshtein-opens-a-rare-window-into-an-insular-world-in-fill-the-void|title=Interview: Director Rama Burshtein opens a rare window into an insular world in 'Fill the Void'|work=[[MSN Movies]]|date=May 28, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref>}}

In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, "I love [[Jane Austen]]. She's romantic, intelligent, and full of humor. <U+2026> The parallel is also quite obvious in that 'Fill the Void' takes place in a world where the rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not looking for some way to burst out of that world. Instead, they are trying to find a way to live within it."<ref name="Cavanese">{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Canavese|url=http://www.pleasantonweekly.com/movies/reviews/Fill-the-Void?review_id=2810|title=Fill the Void|work=[[Pleasanton Weekly]]|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in ''Fill the Void'', and Stephanie Merry from ''The Washington Post'' likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.<ref name="Merry"/> Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.<ref name="Merry"/>

Merry suggested that, regardless of cultural differences, the story is universal due to "its themes of loss and family loyalty, not to mention the realization that life may not align with our idealized expectations".<ref name="Merry"/> ''Boston Globe'' correspondent Peter Keough agreed that the "themes of love and loss, self-sacrifice and self-preservation" are applicable to audiences both in and outside the Orthodox community.<ref name="Keough"/> John Podhoretz, an editor of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', was surprised that the "state of grace" featured prominently in ''Fill the Void'', perceiving it to be an uncommon concept in Jewish movies.<ref name="Podhoretz">{{cite web|first=John|last=Podhoretz|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/keyword/Fill-The-Void-Movie-Review|title=Ultra Life|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=June 10, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

The casting for ''Fill the Void'' took a full year to complete, largely because, according to Rama Burshtein, she "didn't know what [she] wanted".<ref name="Liberti">{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Liberti|url=http://screenpicks.com/2013/05/interview-director-rama-burshtein-and-star-hadas-yaron-of-fill-the-void/|title=Interview: Director, Rama Burshtein, and Star, Hadas Yaron, of 'Fill The Void'|work=Screen Picks|date=May 24, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> She initially considered using "regular people" with no background in acting before realizing that "non-actors couldn't handle the complexities of their characters".<ref name="Liberti"/>

Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, was cast for the role of Shira, the protagonist of the film.<ref name="Loewenstein">{{cite web|first=Melinda|last=Loewenstein|url=http://www.backstage.com/interview/4-acting-tips-from-fill-the-void-hadas-yaron/|title=4 Acting Tips From 'Fill The Void's' Hadas Yaron|work=[[Backstage Magazine]]|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> She commented that her character "is much more na<U+00EF>ve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics".<ref name="Loewenstein"/> Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in ''Fill the Void''. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Hebrew blessings]], saying, "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character."<ref name="Loewenstein"/>

Yiftach Klein was cast to act alongside her as Yochay Goldberg. Burshtein remarked that Klein "is a big star in Israel, and has played a pimp, a homosexual, and a cop (among many other roles), so I was not sure you could really believe him as this Orthodox guy. But his audition, and then his chemistry with Hadas were just perfect".<ref name="Liberti"/>
{{Quote_box |width=30% |align=right|quote="The extras in the film are all from the [Orthodox community]. But among the main actors, only the rabbi and the matchmaker are religious, all the rest are secular professional actors."|source=<U+2014>Rama Burshtein in a 2013 interview.<ref name="Miller"/>}}

Additional cast members include Hila Feldman as Frieda, Irit Sheleg as Rivka Mendelman, Chaim Sharir as Aharon Mendelman, Razia Israeli as Aunt Hanna, Renana Raz as Esther Goldberg, Ido Samuel as Yossi Mendelman, [[Yael Tal]] as Shiffi, Michael David Weigl as Shtreicher, Neta Moran as Bilha, and Melech Thal as Rabbi.

As most of the main cast was not from the Orthodox community, Burshtein instructed them to attend all of the major events that take place within the film, including a [[Jewish wedding|wedding]] and a [[Brit milah|circumcision]].<ref name="Loewenstein"/> Yaron commented, "[At the wedding] it was so intense and [the bride] was crying and she was really in it and I felt like she was my sister because I'm going to be like her in a while. So it was really helpful to experience all these things and to see how it is and to feel a part of it actually."<ref name="Loewenstein"/>

Chani Gurewitz oversaw costume design for the film,<ref name="Variety"/> and much of the low budget was spent on the clothing worn by the actors, which was designed to be soft and colorful.<ref name="Liberti"/><ref name="Variety"/> [[Haredi Judaism#Dress|Traditional Haredi style of dress]] was used, including hats and heavy attire worn by the males and old-fashioned dresses and head coverings worn by the females.<ref name="Young"/>

===Filming===
Rama Burshtein found creating a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron to be one of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film.<ref name="Miller"/> One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, "That's how we see the enigma<U+2014>the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining ''is'' the power. The passion cannot exist if you have it all the time<U+2014>the passion is only for something that you don't have. You have to work to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that."<ref name="Miller"/> Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.<ref name="Liberti"/>

Yaron had never acted in a role with a romance before and at certain points found it difficult to portray the emotions her character felt when interacting with Yochay.<ref name="Liberti"/> Cinematographer Asaf Sudry assisted in conveying to the audience that the marriage between the lead characters would eventually take place by frequently using sunlight for their scenes.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Phillips|url=http://www.knoxville.com/news/2013/jul/18/review-fill-the-void-populated-with-rich/|title=Review: 'Fill the Void' populated with rich characters|work=Knoxville News|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> 

In general, Sudry designed the visual effects in ''Fill the Void'' to create a claustrophobic view point.<ref name="Liberti"/> Blurred backgrounds were often utilized to focus on the faces of the characters, and most of the long takes were shot from an interior perspective.<ref name="Schenker"/> Sudry used [[Arri Alexa]] cameras and short-range lenses with limited camera movements to maintain the effect.<ref name="Sudin"/> Burshtein explained that this was done to illustrate that "the heart is very colorful and very small" and that "we as human beings only see fragments of the big picture; God sees the whole thing!"<ref name="Liberti"/> While a "[[Documentary film|documentary]] feel" was retained throughout most the film's duration, the style was switched for the wedding scene to create a euphoric atmosphere similar to those used in productions by [[Terrence Mallick]] and [[David Lynch]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Valese|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/171825-a-window-to-the-heart-fill-the-voids-rama-burshtein-and-hadas-yaron/|title=A Window to the Heart: "Fill the Void's" Rama Burshtein and Hadas Yaron|work=[[Pop Matters]]|date=May 24, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

The movie relied on subtext, requiring the actors to "read between the lines" for a number of their scenes.<ref name="Loewenstein"/> Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured.<ref name="Merry">{{cite web|first=Stephanie|last=Merry|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-06/news/39786006_1_mother-and-daughter-israeli-film-rama-burshtein|title='Fill the Void' movie review|work=The Washington Post|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref> Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, "I think it's because there is so much pain there; it touches you the most when people feel something and try to hide it and you see it."<ref name="Loewenstein"/>

Following the completion of the filming, Burshtein continued to edit the footage for another year and three months until it was declared complete.<ref name="Dawson">{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Dawson|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/71342-rama-burshtein-on-fill-the-void/|title=Rama Burshtein on Fill the Void|work=Film Maker Magazine|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref>

===Music===
Yitzhak Azulay composed the music played in ''Fill the Void''.<ref name="Young"/> He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the movie.<ref name="Young"/> Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music,<ref name="Glinter">{{cite web|first=Ezra|last=Glinter|url=http://forward.com/articles/176708/orthodox-world-provides-backdrop-for-rama-burshtei/?p=all|title=Orthodox World Provides Backdrop for Rama Burshtein's Universal Story|work=[[Forward Magazine]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> and the prayers are "regularly chanted rather than spoken".<ref name="Variety"/> The song "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <U+05D0><U+05DD> <U+05D0><U+05E9><U+05DB><U+05D7><U+05DA> <U+05D9><U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DD><U+200E>, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features prominently in the film, playing at all three of the major events: the funeral, the [[Bris Milah]], and the wedding.<ref name="Sudin"/> Azulay used an [[acapella]] version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour."<ref name="Sudin">{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Sudin|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/05/24/film-review-fill-the-void-video/|title=Film Review: Fill the Void (VIDEO)|work=[[Algemeiner Journal]]|date=May 24, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

Shira is frequently shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron did not know how to play.<ref name="Saito">{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Saito|url=http://moveablefest.com/moveable_fest/2013/06/hadas-yaron-fill-the-void-interview.html|title=Interview: Hadas Yaron on Taking Control of Her Destiny With "Fill the Void"|work=The Moveable Fest|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref> She described it as a "very difficult instrument" and stated, "There was so much noise in [one scene]. It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh [as I tried to play], I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [in my head] like don't listen to it and feel what you<U+2019>'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [the crew] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment."<ref name="Saito"/>

===Critical reviews===
''Fill the Void'' received mostly positive reviews, and several critics compared the female characters to [[Jane Austen]]'s.<ref name="Variety"/><ref name="Scott">{{cite web|first=A.

Working as a woman of faith in a medium looked on with understandable suspicion and skepticism by those who believe as she does, Rama Burshtein has made a work of art of overwhelming beauty and impact."<ref name="Podhoretz"/> ''[[The New York Post]]'' critic Farran Smith Nehme disagreed, writing, "While the social milieu is nicely realized, other parts of the drama are not. Too often Burshtein cuts off a scene prematurely, darting away just as the crucial moment of emotion or confrontation appears."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/fill_the_void_rAXRNwys1Ja3EWLua6HwbO|title='Fill The Void' review|first=Farran|last=Smith Nehme|work=The New York Post|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' correspondent Peter Keough gave the film a highly favorable review:

{{quote|Films tend to confirm, not confront, stereotypes. Not so Israeli director Rama Burshtein's exquisitely acted, radiantly shot, and delicately nuanced "Fill the Void," a melodrama set in the ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jewish community of Tel Aviv. By bringing to life complex and sympathetic characters in a precisely observed setting and social framework, and by presenting that isolated world as a microcosm, Burshtein has achieved a gripping film without victims or villains, an ambiguous tragedy drawing on universal themes of love and loss, self-sacrifice and self-preservation.<ref name="Keough">{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/06/20/movie-review-fill-void-israeli-film-which-family-and-freedom-collide/FCYF9J2FES7DG7PqeNozFK/story.html|title=Family and freedom collide in 'Fill the Void'|first=Peter|last=Keough|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=June 20, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}</ref>}}

Deborah Young from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also published a good review, adding that it was "more realistic than beautiful, though when the story calls for it she has no trouble injecting poetry into a scene."<ref name="Young">Deborah Young, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/venice-2012-fill-void-lemale-hachalal-movie-review-367365 Fill the Void (Lemale Et Ha'Chalal): Venice Review], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'',  9/1/2012</ref> A review in ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' was equally positive, adding that the film used "long static takes, restricting her shots largely to interiors and strategically alternating between depth staging and blurry backgrounds, Rama Burshtein brings a sense of inevitability and constriction to the insular world of Israeli Hassidic Judaism."<ref name="Schenker">Andrew Schenker, [http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/fill-the-void/6578 Fill the Void], ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', October 2, 2012</ref> More broadly, ''[[Screen International]]'' suggested that director "Burshtein paints a perfect bubble that can last only as long as it has no contact with the world outside (no secular presence is allowed in here)."<ref>Dan Fainaru, [http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/fill-the-void/5045969.article Fill The Void], ''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'', September 02, 2012</ref>

Additionally, critics praised the respect shown to the portrayal of Orthodox Jews in the movie. Jane Esiner from ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that, "While the film may deliver a message at odds with contemporary feminism in the eyes of some critics, the movie portrays female characters with a strength that is both subtle and believable."<ref name="nytimes">Jane Esiner, [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/movies/fill-the-void-directed-by-rama-burshtein.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 An Unconventional Look at Orthodoxy], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 03, 2013 </ref> A. O. Scott, also from ''The New York Times'', added, "Their routines are dominated by prayer, ritual observance and obedience to Jewish law, but their world does not seem narrow and austere. On the contrary, it is at times almost unbearably full of feeling and significance."<ref name="Scott"/>

Scott further commended the acting by Hadas Yaron, saying, "Shira is modest and sensible, forthright with her opinions and discreet about expressing emotion, but the way Ms. Yaron composes her features <U+2014> and the way she is lighted by Ms. Burshtein and the cinematographer, Asaf Sudry <U+2014> seems to offer direct access to her soul."<ref name="Scott"/> Likewise, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' film critic Kenneth Turan found Yaron's performance "exceptional".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/24/entertainment/la-et-mn-fill-the-void-review-20130524|title=Review: Transfixing 'Fill the Void' looks at love by arrangement|first=Kenneth|last=Turan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 24, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> By contrast, Peter Cavanese from ''[[Pleasanton Weekly]]'' disliked the idea of Shira marrying under the circumstances in the movie and wrote that she "comes across as temperamentally battered by her mother and her potential husband, who is himself slow to see the wisdom of marrying Shira".<ref name="Cavanese"/>
