'''Beechwood''' is a [[Hudson River]] estate in Scarborough-on-Hudson, in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. The estate was the home of [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] and his family, and is a contributing property to the [[Scarborough Historic District]]. The house and property were owned by the Vanderlip family until 1979. The property is now a 37-condominium complex as the result of a development project that began in the 1980s. 

Contemporarily, Beechwood is known for being a filming location of the 1970 film ''[[House of Dark Shadows]]'',<ref name="HDS"/> and a filming location and the primary setting of ''[[Savages (1972 film)|Savages]]'', a 1972 [[Merchant Ivory]] film.<ref name="Savages"/><ref name="Savages2"/>

==History==
The main residence probably dates to the late 1700s.<ref name="ScHD"/> Benjamin and Ann Folger were among the earliest residents, and named their residence "Heartt Place". In the 1830s, Folger deeded the estate to a self-proclaimed prophet, [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthews]], who believed himself to be the resurrected [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]] of the [[New Testament]].<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=18}} Matthews convinced his followers to fund an expansion to the house, which he had named "Zion Hill". During this time, Isabella Van Wagenen ([[Sojourner Truth]]) was a housekeeper to him. After he spent the money his followers and Folger had given him, Matthews became violent. Further on, he was tried for murder, and acquitted for lack of evidence.<ref name="pamphlet"/> Matthews was later found guilty of assaulting his grown daughter, and he served a short jail term.<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=19}}

The property containing the mansion had been in the Remsen family for decades. Anna Remsen Webb was one of the inheritors of the estate. In the 1890s, her husband's half-brother [[Henry Walter Webb]] substantially added to the estate from numerous properties, including the Remsen estate and William Creighton's estate (Creighton had named his house "Beechwood" after he purchased it in 1836). Henry Webb attached the name Beechwood to the entire estate and house. He renovated and expanded the mansion, hiring [[R. H. Robertson]] to double the size of the house. Robertson designed the expansion in the [[Colonial Revival]] style, to be compatible with the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Federal style]] of the original but more ornate.<ref name="WestNRHP"/>

Frank Vanderlip purchased the {{convert|23|acre|ha|adj=on}} property from Webb's widow in 1906, and bought more property to make the estate a total {{convert|125|acre|ha}}. He hired [[William Welles Bosworth]] soon after to further enlarge the house and to design a wing for his library and the lawns of the estate.<ref name="ScHD"/> In 1907, while Vanderlip was vice president of the First National City Bank (later [[Citibank]]), he had two columns from the headquarters [[55 Wall Street]] shipped to Beechwood (55 Wall Street was being remodeled and the columns were re-spaced, with two left over). He had the columns placed two-thirds above ground in Beechwood's entranceway off of Albany Post Road (now [[U.S. Route 9]]), an entrance which was later closed due to increasing traffic volume on Route 9 (the current entrance is off Scarborough Station Road). Vanderlip also made a cage for his children's pet rabbits using a discarded wrought-iron elevator, also discarded from the bank. Among the guests the Vanderlips hosted at the house were [[Woodrow Wilson]],<ref name="Wilson"/> [[Henry Ford]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], and [[Isadora Duncan]].<ref name="Vanderbilts"/> In 1910, Vanderlip bought the nearby mansion [[Woodlea]], although his wife Narcissa Vanderlip prevented the family from moving, due to her preference of Beechwood over the grandiose Woodlea.<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=89}} In 1979, Vanderlip descendants sold the property.<ref name="WestNRHP"/> Three condominiums were built during a transformation of the mansion in the 1980s. A later expansion resulted in a total of 37 condominiums on the property's 33 acres.<ref name="NYTScarborough"/>

==Description==
The {{convert|80|acre|ha|adj=on}} private parkland was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] for the Vanderlips and has expansive lawns, a grove of large [[beech]] trees, imported trees, and an [[Italianate]] garden with an alcove, fountain, and small pool with ''[[Wisteria]]''-covered trellises. The lawns, formal gardens, and stone gazebo, erected by the Vanderlips, have been preserved and feature in wedding ceremonies that occasionally occur on the property.<ref name="NYTScarborough"/>

Near the center of the property sits the [[wikt:eponymous|eponymous]] mansion that features two large [[portico]]ed entryways, a two-story octagonal library, numerous porches, [[veranda]]s, and over 100 interior rooms. Other major structures included a hunting lodge, a second mansion built for the Vanderlips' daughter Charlotte, a home for the Vanderlips' physician, and the [[Scarborough School]], a progressive school which the Vanderlips established just south of the mansion in 1916.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The Beechwood estate also contained a [[carriage house]], [[gatehouse]], [[squash court]] (no longer extant), and a white-stucco artist's studio named Beech Twig, which was home to author [[John Cheever]], whose children attended the school on the property. The family rented the house until they moved to Ossining.<ref name="Cheever"/> Descriptions of the building's interior closely match descriptions employed by Cheever in some short stories. Novelist [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]] also lived in the same house as a child, as well as other artists, writers, and composers. The estate's garage is located northeast of the mansion, and is a flat-roof, two-story concrete building dating to the early 1900s.<ref name="ScHD"/>
