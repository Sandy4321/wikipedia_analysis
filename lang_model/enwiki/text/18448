'''Tool''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up has included drummer [[Danny Carey]], guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]], and vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]]. Since 1995, [[Justin Chancellor]] has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist [[Paul D'Amour]]. Tool has won three [[Grammy Awards]], performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.

The band emerged with a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound on their first studio album, <!--Undertow was Tool's first full-length album; Opiate was only an EP, and does not need mention here-->''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993), and later became a dominant act in the [[alternative metal]] movement with the release of their second effort, ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'', in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, [[visual arts]], and a message of personal evolution continued with ''[[Lateralus]]'' (2001) and the most recent album, ''[[10,000 Days]]'' (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and commercial success around the world.

Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[art rock]]. The relationship between the band and today's [[music industry]] is ambivalent, at times marked by [[Censorship of music|censorship]] and the band members' insistence on privacy.

==History==

===Early years (1988<U+2013>1992)===
{{Main|72826|Opiate (EP)}}
During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both [[Paul D'Amour]] and [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] wanted to enter the film industry, while [[Maynard James Keenan]] found employment remodeling pet stores after having studied visual arts in Michigan.<ref name="livewire" /> [[Danny Carey]] performed as a drummer for Wild Blue Yonder, [[Green Jell<U+00FF>]],<ref name="livewire" /> and [[Carole King]], and played in the Los Angeles area with [[Pigmy Love Circus]].<ref name="Tepedelen 2004" />

Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989.{{sfn|Kitts|Tolinski|2002|pp=1965<U+2013>1969}} After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band.{{sfn|Kitts|Tolinski|2002|pp=1965<U+2013>1969}} They started [[jam session|jamming]] together and were on the lookout for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by [[Tom Morello]], an old high school friend of Jones and former member of [[Electric Sheep (band)|Electric Sheep]].{{sfn|Newquist|Maloof|2004|pp=11<U+2013>15}} Carey began playing in their sessions because he "felt kinda sorry for them," as other invited musicians were not showing up.{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=C3}} Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour.<ref name="circusmagazine" /> Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the [[pseudophilosophy]] "lachrymology".<ref name="MacKenzie Blake" /> Although "lachrymology" was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve."<ref name="Zappa 1994" />

After almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies,{{sfn|Kitts|Tolinski|2002|pp=1965<U+2013>1969}} and eventually signed a record deal with [[Zoo Entertainment (record label)|Zoo Entertainment]].<ref name="circusmagazine" /> In March 1992, Zoo published the band's first effort, ''[[Opiate (album)|Opiate]]''. Described by the band as "slam and bang" heavy music{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=E8}} and the "hardest sounding" six songs they had written to that point,<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" /> the [[Extended play|EP]] included the singles "[[Hush (Tool song)|Hush]]" and "Opiate". The band's first music video, "Hush", promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent [[Parents Music Resource Center]] and its advocacy of the [[censorship of music]]. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by [[Parental Advisory|parental advisory]] stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape.<ref name="much" /> The band began touring with [[Rollins Band]], [[Fishbone]], and [[Rage Against the Machine]]<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of ''RIP Magazine'' summarized in September 1992 as a "buzz" and "a strong start".<ref name="Garza 1992" />

===''Undertow'' (1993<U+2013>1995)===
{{Main|Undertow (Tool album)}}

{{listen|filename=Tool - Undertow - Prison Sex - sample.ogg|title=Prison Sex|description="Prison Sex" was removed from the MTV playlist and deemed too graphic and offensive by [[MuchMusic]].<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"  /><ref name="sfc94" /> In this sample, Keenan begins his metaphorical treatment of [[child abuse]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The following year, at a time when [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than ''Opiate'' and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" /> The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Church of Scientology]], which was perceived as a clash with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being."<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"  /> Keenan "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience."<ref name="33 things" />

[[File:Tool-logo-early.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A well known band logo created by longtime collaborator [[Cam de Leon]],<ref name="Lowe Law 2006" /> this wrench is an example of "[[Phallus|phallic]] hardware" in Tool's imagery.<ref name="Buffalo News 1997" />]]

Tool later played several concerts during the [[Lollapalooza]] festival tour, and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co-founder [[Ted Gardner]].<ref name="pettigrew1997" /> At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian [[Bill Hicks]] introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in ''Undertow'''s liner notes.<ref name="Garza 1997" /> He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens.<ref name="Kevin Booth" /> The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped ''Undertow'' to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995,<ref name="Circus 1997" /> despite being sold with a [[Corporate censorship|censored]] album cover by distributors such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref name="Axcess" />{{sfn|Sherry|Aldis|2006|p=176}} The single "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band Billboard's "Best Video by a New Artist" award for the accompanying [[stop motion]] music video.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" />

With the release of Tool's follow-up single "[[Prison Sex (song)|Prison Sex]]", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with [[child abuse]], which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: "It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his "surrealistic interpretation" of the subject matter.<ref name="hypno" /> And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as "metaphoric",<ref name="much" /><ref name="sfc94" /> the American branch of [[MuchMusic]] asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene,<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"  /> and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.<ref name="sfc94" />

In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. [[Justin Chancellor]], a member of former tourmates [[Peach (band)|Peach]], eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as [[Kyuss]]' [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]], [[Filter (band)|Filter]]'s Frank Cavanaugh, [[Pigmy Love Circus]]'s E. Shepherd Stevenson, and [[ZAUM]]'s Marco Fox.<ref name="Fiend 1996" />

===''<U+00C6>nima'' (1996<U+2013>2000)===
{{Main|<U+00C6>nima}}
[[File:Tool aenima cover dedication to hicks.jpg|thumb|Alternate version of the ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' artwork shows a dedication to comedian [[Bill Hicks]] as "another dead hero".]]

On September 17, 1996, Tool released their second full-length album, ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|<U+0252>|n|<U+026A>|m|<U+0259>}}).{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=G2}} It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|triple platinum]] by the RIAA on March 4, 2003.<ref name="Post Gazette 2006" /> D'Amour left Tool and Chancellor came on board during the recording of the album. The band enlisted the help of producer [[David Bottrill]], who had produced some of [[King Crimson]]'s albums, while Jones collaborated with [[Cam de Leon]] to create ''<U+00C6>nima'''s Grammy-nominated artwork.<ref name="Aenima liner notes" />{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=D11}}

The album was dedicated to [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] [[Bill Hicks]], who had died two and a half years earlier.<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".<ref name="austinkeenanhicks" /> In particular, ''<U+00C6>nima'''s final track "Third Eye" is preceded by a clip of Hicks' performances, and the [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] casing of the ''<U+00C6>nima'' album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "[[<U+00C6>nema]]" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's ''[[Arizona Bay]]'', in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="austinkeenanhicks" /><ref name="Zwick 2004" />

The first single, "[[Stinkfist]]", garnered limited and imperfect airplay: It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of "Stinkfist" to "Track No.&nbsp;1" due to offensive connotations,<ref name="stinkfist" /> and the lyrics of the song were altered.{{sfn|McIver|2009|p=137}} Responding to fan complaints about censorship, [[Matt Pinfield]] of MTV's ''120 Minutes'' expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.<ref name="stinkfist"  />

{{listen|filename=Tool - <U+00C6>nima - <U+00C6>nema - sample.ogg|title=<U+00C6>nema|description=This [[Bill Hicks]] inspired song won the 1998 [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}

A tour began in October 1996, two weeks after ''<U+00C6>nima'''s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. April 1 of that year saw the first of several [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] pranks related to the band. [[Kabir Akhtar]], webmaster of the band's semi-official fanpage, The Tool Page, wrote that "at least three of the band are listed in critical condition" after a tour bus accident on a highway.<ref name="tdn - april fools 97" /> This hoax gained wide attention and was eventually exposed on radio and MTV. Akhtar later posted an apology, claiming that The Tool Page "will not indulge itself in such outlandish pranks in the future"<U+2014>a claim that would be belied by later April Fools' pranks.<ref name="tdn - april fools 97" /> The tour continued the next day as originally announced.{{citation needed|date = October 2012}}

Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at Lollapalooza '97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{quote|Tool was returning in triumph to Lollapalooza after appearing among the obscure bands on the festival's smaller stage in 1993. Now Tool is the prime attraction for a festival that's struggling to maintain its purpose ... Tool uses taboo-breaking imagery for hellfire moralizing in songs that swerve from bitter reproach to nihilistic condemnation. Its music has refined all the troubled majesty of grunge.<ref name="nytimeslollapalooza" />}}

[[File:Justin chancellor tool roskilde festival 2006 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bassist [[Justin Chancellor]] performing at 2006's [[Roskilde Festival]]]]
Notwithstanding a decline in popularity of alternative rock music during the mid-90s in the United States, ''<U+00C6>nima'' eventually matched Tool's successful debut album in sales.<ref name="Fruchtman 2006" /> The progressive-influenced ''<U+00C6>nima'' landed the band at the head of the [[alternative metal]] genre: It featured the Grammy Award-winning "<U+00C6>nema"<ref name="Rock on the Net 1998" /> and appeared on several "Best Albums of 1996" lists,<ref name="acclaimedaenima" /> with notable examples being those of ''[[Kerrang!]]''<ref name="Kerrang" /> and ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]''.<ref name="Terrorizer" />

A legal battle that began the same year interfered with the band's working on another release. [[Volcano Entertainment]]<U+2014>the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment<U+2014>alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal.{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=C15}}<ref name="MTV December 1998" /> In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.<ref name="Borzillo-Vrenna 2000" />

During this time, Keenan joined the band [[A Perfect Circle]], which was founded by long-time Tool guitar tech [[Billy Howerdel]], while Jones joined The Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] and Carey drummed with Dead Kennedys' [[Jello Biafra]] on side projects.<ref name="Slater 2001" /> Although there were rumors that Tool were breaking up,<ref name="Kline 2002" /><ref name="Beaumont Enterprise 2002" /> Chancellor, Jones, and Carey were working on new material while waiting for Keenan to return.<ref name="Stout 2001" /> In 2000, the ''[[Salival]]'' [[box set]] (CD/VHS or CD/DVD) was released, effectively putting an end to the rumors.<ref name="AllMusic Biography" /> The CD contained one new original track, a [[Cover version|cover]] of Led Zeppelin's "[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]", a live version of Peach's "[[You Lied]]", and revised versions of old songs. The VHS and the DVD each contained four music videos, plus a bonus music video for "Hush" on the DVD. Although ''Salival'' did not yield any singles, the hidden track "Maynard's Dick" (which dates back to the ''Opiate'' era) briefly found its way to [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] when several DJs chose to play it on air under the title "Maynard's Dead".{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=H26}}

===''Lateralus'' (2001<U+2013>2005)===
{{Main|Lateralus}}
[[File:Adam jones tool roskilde festival 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Guitarist Adam Jones performing at Roskilde Festival 2006.]]
In January 2001, Tool announced a new album, ''Systema Enc<U+00E9>phale'', along with a 12-song tracklist containing titles such as "Riverchrist", "Numbereft", "Encephatalis", "Musick", and "Coeliacus".<ref name="tdnsystematracks" /> File-sharing networks such as [[Napster]] were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names.<ref name="tdnsystematracks" /> At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers. Keenan said during an interview with ''[[NY Rock]]'' in 2000, "I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs."<ref name="Gabriella 2006" />

A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled ''[[Lateralus]]''; the name ''Systema Enc<U+00E9>phale'' and the tracklist had been a ruse.<ref name="mtvnewssystema" /> ''Lateralus'' and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward [[art rock]]<ref name="e!onlinelateralus" /><ref name="kingcrimsonminitour" /><ref name="munge" /> and [[progressive rock]]<ref name="AMG Lateralus review" /><ref name="rollingstonelateralus" />{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=562}} territory. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that "Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent [[death march]] ... The prolonged running times of most of ''Lateralus''{{'}} thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with [[suite (music)|suite]]like purpose."<ref name="rollingstonelateralus" /> Joshua Klein of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' expressed his opinion that ''Lateralus'', with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs<U+2014>topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for "[[Parabola (song)|Parabola]]"<U+2014>posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.<ref name="Klein 2002" />

{{listen|filename=Tool_-_Lateralus_-_Schism_-_sample.ogg|title=Schism|description="Schism" is the Grammy awarded first single off ''Lateralus''. With its abstract lyrics and multi-sectioned, odd-metered structure it has since become a signature song of the band.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart in its debut week.<ref name="Cohen, Martens 2001" /> Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]".<ref name="Grammy Awards" /> During the band's acceptance speech, drummer Carey stated that he would like to thank his parents (for putting up with him) and [[Satan]], and bassist Chancellor concluded: "I want to thank my dad for doing my mom."<ref name="D'Angelo 2002" />

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported ''Lateralus'' and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with [[King Crimson]] in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as "the once and future kings of progressive rock". Keenan stated of the minitour: "For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like [[Lenny Kravitz]] playing with Led Zeppelin, or [[Britney Spears]] onstage with [[Debbie Gibson]]."<ref name="kingcrimsonminitour" />

Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to signal the start of another hiatus for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with [[A Perfect Circle]], the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both exclusive to the fan club. On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced that "Maynard has found Jesus" and would be abandoning the recording of the new Tool album temporarily and possibly permanently.<ref name="Hay 2006" /> [[Kurt Loder]] of MTV contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan's response was simply "heh heh."<ref name="Harris 2005" /> On April 7 the official site announced, "Good news, April fools fans. The writing and recording is back under way."<ref name="MacKenzie Blake 2005" />

Work continued on the follow-up to ''Lateralus''; meanwhile, a ''Lateralus'' vinyl edition and two DVD singles were released, and the band's official website received a new splash intro by artist [[Joshua Davis (web designer)|Joshua Davis]].<ref name="Joshua Davis" /> The "double [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] four-picture disc" edition of ''Lateralus'' was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. On December 20 the two DVDs were released, one containing the single "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]" and the other "[[Parabola (song)|Parabola]]", a remix by [[Lustmord]], and a music video with commentary by [[David Yow]] and [[Jello Biafra]].

===''10,000 Days'' (2006<U+2013>2007)===
{{Main|10,000 Days}}
[[File:Tool roskilde festival 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Tool performing a headline slot at the [[Roskilde Festival]] as part of the "10,000 Days" tour]]
Fifteen years into the band's career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' described as a devoted "[[Cult following|cult]]" following,<ref name="Epstein 2006" /> and as details about the band's next album emerged, such as the influence of ''Lateralus'' tourmates [[Fant<U+00F4>mas (band)|Fant<U+00F4>mas]] and [[Meshuggah]],<ref name="mtvhammer" /> controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs.<ref name="theage10kdays" /> Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was ''[[10,000 Days]]''. Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that ''10,000 Days'' was merely a "decoy" album to fool audiences.<ref name="theage10kdays" /> The rumor was proven false when a [[internet leak|leaked]] copy of the album was distributed via [[filesharing]] networks a week prior to its official release.<ref name="Harris May 11, 2006" />

The album opener, "[[Vicarious (Tool song)|Vicarious]]", premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. ''10,000 Days'' sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 charts, doubling the sales of [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Pearl Jam (album)|self-titled album]], its closest competitor.<ref name="Harris May 10, 2006" /> However, ''10,000 Days'' was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor ''[[Lateralus]]'' had been.<ref name="Metacritic 2006" /><ref name="Metacritic 2001" />

Prior to the release of ''10,000 Days'', a tour kicked off at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the ''Lateralus'' tour of 2001; supporting acts were [[Isis (band)|Isis]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend's dog, casting uncertainty on the band's upcoming concerts in North America.<ref name="Toolband 2007" />  Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] with a guest appearance from [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s [[Tom Morello]] on "[[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]]".<ref name="Cohen 2007" /> Meanwhile, "Vicarious" was a nominee for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] and ''10,000 Days'' won [[Best Recording Package]] at the [[49th Grammy Awards]].<ref name="49thgrammyawards" /> The music video for "Vicarious" was released on DVD on December 18.

===Hiatus and fifth studio album (2008<U+2013>present)===
[[File:Tool-live-Paris.jpg|thumb|Tool in Paris in 2006]]
Chancellor stated in May 2007 that the band would probably continue their tour until early 2008 and then "take some time off".<ref name="justinnwlanews" /> He added that the band had already written some new material and would surely release another album at some point. He speculated about the possibility of a "band movie", something the band has considered for a long time. Ideas ranged from "a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible" to "pockets of all of that or something that's live or the band playing".<ref name="billboardmovie" /> Although Carey stated that the necessary know-how was at hand due to the band's connections to artists working in the movie business, Jones dismissed the idea, saying "It's just talk right now."<ref name=billboardmovie /><ref name="Rock Radio 2007" />

The band's 2009 summer tour began on July 18 in [[Commerce City, Colorado]], at the [[Mile High Music Festival]]. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and a show on August 22 for the [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter Festival]] in Pomona, California.<ref name="Blabbermouth 2009" /><ref name="Mile High press release 2009" /><ref name="Lollapalooza press release 2009" /> Their [[Tool Winter Tour]] played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012.<ref name="Fourtheye 2012" /><ref name="Audio Ink 2012" /> The band will play at [[Ozzfest|Ozzfest Japan]] on May 12, 2013.<ref name="Blabbermouth 2012" /> Work on writing the new album began in 2009,<ref name="Harris Mancini 2009" /> and by the following March they had begun the process "in earnest".<ref name="Toolband 2010" /> Meanwhile, Tool members have pursued their own musical projects. Keenan has toured extensively with [[Puscifer]], which he describes as involving a series of musical ideas he did not have an opportunity to explore with Tool or A Perfect Circle.<ref name="Kinski 2010" /> Jones and Carey worked together on the fifth album while he was on tour; Keenan can't predict how much longer the process will take.<ref name="FMQB 2011" /> Carey agreed, saying "no wine before its time."<ref name="Danny, Fourtheye 2012" /> In January 2013, the band stated they were "over half done" with their upcoming album.<ref name="newsletterDEC2012" /> In early February, despite Keenan stating that there would not be a new album released in 2013, Carey said that the album might still be released "sometime this year."<ref name="Blabbermouth February 2013" />

==Musical style and influences==
Tool was described by Patrick Donovan of ''[[The Age]]'' as "the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions."<ref name="theage10kdays" /> Tool has gained critical praise from the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''{{'}}s C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound.<ref name="Liddell 2007" /> Describing their general sound, [[Allmusic]] refers to them as "grinding, post-[[Jane's Addiction]] heavy metal",<ref name="AllMusic Biography" /> and ''[[The New York Times]]'' sees similarities to "Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes".<ref name="Pareles 1997" /> Their 2001 work ''Lateralus'' was compared by Allmusic to [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Meddle]]'' (1971), but thirty years later and altered by "Tool's impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread".<ref name="AMG Lateralus review" /> Tool had been labelled as [[post-metal]] in 1993<ref name="santiago" /> and 1996,<ref name="fenix" /> as well as in 2006,<ref name="bairdcole" /> after the term came into popularity.

===Musical style===
A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of [[Unusual time signatures|odd time signatures]]. For instance, Chancellor describes the time signature employed on the first single from ''Lateralus'', "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]", as 13/16 and that it later "goes into all kinds of other times".<ref name="bassplayer052001" /> Further examples include the album's title track, which also displays shifting rhythms,<ref name="bassplayer052001" /> as does ''10,000 Days: Wings for Marie (Pt 1)" and "10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)".<ref name="moderndrummer072006" />

Beyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his musical scope. [[Bass Player (magazine)|''Bass Player'' magazine]] described Chancellor's bass playing as a "thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility".<ref name="bassplayer052001" /> As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah effect]] by [[Hammer-on|hammering]] "the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep", such as on the song "The Patient", from ''Lateralus''.<ref name="bassplayer052001" />

Completing the band's [[rhythm section]], drummer Carey uses [[polyrhythm]]s, [[tabla]]-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to trigger samples, such as prerecorded tabla and [[octoban]] sounds.<ref name="moderndrummer072006" />

Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'': After his performance during an [[Alice in Chains]] reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as "a natural fit at replacing [[Layne Staley]]".<ref name="Hay 2005" /> Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, ''The New York Times'' wrote that "both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity".<ref name="nytimeskeenan" />

{{listen|filename=Tool - Lateralus - 09 - Lateralus sample.ogg|title=Lateralus|description=The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the [[Fibonacci number]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

According to ''Guitar Player'' magazine, Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques.<ref name="guitarplayer2001" /> For example, Allmusic wrote that he "alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism" in "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]".<ref name="soberamgreview" /> Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a "pipe bomb microphone" (a [[Pick up (music technology)|guitar pickup]] mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a [[talk box]] guitar solo on "Jambi".<ref name="Forlenza 2006" />

The band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with any album.<ref name="livewire" /> Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in "Lateralus". The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the [[Fibonacci number]]s<ref name="diCarlointerview" /> and the song "Jambi" uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]].<ref name="julynewsletter" /> The lyrics on ''<U+00C6>nima'' and ''Lateralus'' focus on philosophy and spirituality<U+2014>specific subjects range from organized religion in "Opiate", to [[evolution]] and [[Jungian]] psychology in "[[Forty-Six & 2]]" and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] in "Lateralus".<ref name="10kdayslyrics" /> On ''10,000 Days'', Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him:<ref name="10kdayslyrics" /> the album name and title track refer to the twenty-seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003.<ref name="rs10kdaysreview" />

===Influences===
The band has named the group [[Melvins]]<ref name="pettigrew1997" /> as an influence on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group [[King Crimson]].<ref name="Blake September 2001" /> Longtime King Crimson member [[Robert Fripp]] has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing."<ref name="Tool Army interview" /> He also said, "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been an influence on them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn<U+2019>t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool."<ref name="Cleveland 2003" /> In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the [[Sex Pistols]].<ref name="bgl06">{{cite news|title=Sonic evolution with the use of Tool |last=Morse|first=Steve|date=November 15, 1996|work=Boston Globe|pages=D.14|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>

Writers Harvey Newquist and Rich Maloof attribute to Tool an influence on modern metal in their book ''The New Metal Masters''.{{sfn|Newquist|Maloof|2004|pp=11<U+2013>15}} Sean Richardson of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' sees [[System of a Down]], [[Deftones]], and [[Korn]] as examples of Tool's "towering influence" on the genre.<ref name="Richardson 2001" /> Keenan's unique style of singing has been seen as heavily influencing artists such as [[Pete Loeffler]] of [[Chevelle]],<ref name="Rich 2007" /> Will Martin of [[Earshot]],<ref name="Assar 2003" /> and [[Fred Durst]] of [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref name="Devenish 2000" />

==Visual arts==
Part of Tool's work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos, live shows, and album packaging. Adam Jones doubles as the band's art director and director of their music videos.<ref name="alexgreyinterview" /> Another expression of this is an official website "dedicated to the arts and influences" on the band.

===Music videos===
{{See also|Tool discography#Music videos|l1=Tool discography}}
[[File:Tool-Sober-video-screencap.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from the "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" music video, directed by Adam Jones and Fred Stuhr]]

The band has released nine music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two, which the band states is to prevent people from "latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music."<ref name="much" /> With the exception of "[[Hush (Tool song)|Hush]]," "[[Vicarious (Tool song)|Vicarious]]" and "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]" all of Tool's music videos feature [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] to some extent. The videos are created primarily by Adam Jones, often in collaboration with artists such as [[Chet Zar]],<ref name="LiveDesign" /> [[Alex Grey]],<ref name="LiveDesign" /> and [[Osseus Labyrint]].<ref name="Blake March 2007" />

The "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]" music video in particular attracted much attention. Jones explained that it doesn't contain a storyline, but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described this imagery as "evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall" and called it a "groundbreaking", "epic" clip.<ref name="soberencephale" /> ''Billboard'' voted it "Best Video by a New Artist".<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades" />

The video for "[[Vicarious (song)|Vicarious]]" was released on DVD on December 18, 2007.<ref name="Blake October 2007" /> The video is the second by Tool to be produced entirely through the use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].

===Album artwork===
Jones is responsible for most of the band's artwork concepts. Their album ''Undertow'' features a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members.<ref name="hypno" /> Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: ''<U+00C6>nima''{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=G4}} and ''Salival'' featured works by [[Cam de Leon]]; ''Lateralus''<ref name="Stephens 2002" /> and ''10,000 Days''<ref name="alexgreyinterview" /> were created with the help of [[Alex Grey]]. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the [[Associated Press]] attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.<ref name="alexgreyinterview" />

Both ''<U+00C6>nima''{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=D11}} and ''10,000 Days''<ref name="49thgrammyawards" /> were nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]], but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for ''10,000 Days'' that features a pair of [[stereoscopic]] lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the '70s artwork he appreciates.<ref name="newsgrammypackage" />

===Live shows===
{{see also|List of Tool concert tours}}

[[File:Tool live mannheim 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Tool's live performances in 2006 included an elaborate light show using ''10,000 Days'' artwork by painter [[Alex Grey]] as a backdrop.]]

Following their first tours in the early 1990s, Tool has performed as a headline act in world tours and major festivals such as [[Lollapalooza]] (1997 and 2009), [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] (1999 and 2006), [[Download Festival]] (2006), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (2001 and 2006), [[Big Day Out]] (2007 and 2011), [[Bonnaroo]] (2007), [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] (2009), and [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter]] (2009). They have been joined on stage by numerous artists such as [[Buzz Osborne]] and [[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]] on several occasions; [[Tom Morello]] and [[Zack de la Rocha]] during their 1991 tour; [[Tricky]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Mike Patton]], [[Dave Lombardo]], [[Brann Dailor]] of [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], and experimental arts duo [[Osseus Labyrint]]<ref name="Osseus live" /> during their 2001<U+2013>02 ''Lateralus'' tour; and [[Kirk Hammett]], [[Phil Campbell (musician)|Phil Campbell]], [[Serj Tankian]], and Tom Morello during their 2006<U+2013>07 tour. They have covered songs by Led Zeppelin, [[Ted Nugent]], [[Peach (band)|Peach]], [[Kyuss]], and the [[Ramones]].{{sfn|Akhtar|2001|loc=D9}}<ref name="Rothman 2002" />

Live shows on Tool's headline tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display.<ref name="flathatreview" /> Keenan and Carey line up in the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage.<ref name="nytimesmadisonsquare" /> Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience.<ref name="Rolling Stone November 1996" /><ref name="Rolling Stone November 1996"  /><ref name="Musial 1997" /><ref name="Dentler 2002" /><ref name="Engler 1993" /> No [[followspot]]s or live cameras are used;<ref name="plsnews" /> instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd.<ref name="flathatreview" /> Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, "[a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he<U+2019>s trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows."<ref name="plsnews" /> The big screens are used to play back "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They<U+2019>ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice."<ref name="plsnews" /> During the ''10,000 Days'' tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, [[Chet Zar]], Meats Meier, and Haggerty.<ref name="plsnews" /> Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD ''Disturb the Normal''.<ref name="chetzardisturb" />
