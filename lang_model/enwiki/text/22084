'''Parson Street railway station''' serves the western end of [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]] in [[Bristol]], [[England]]. It also serves other surrounding suburbs including [[Bishopsworth]] and [[Ashton Gate]], along with [[Bristol City FC]]. It is {{convert|2|mi|km}} from {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}, and {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} from [[Paddington station|London Paddington]]. Its three letter station code is '''PSN'''. It was opened in 1927 by the [[Great Western Railway]], and was rebuilt in 1933. The station, which has two through-lines and two platforms, plus one freight line for traffic on the [[Portishead Branch Line]], has minimal facilities. As of 2012, it is managed by [[First Great Western]], which is the sixth company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]] in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly an hourly service between {{rws|Bristol Parkway}} and {{rws|Weston-super-Mare}}.

There is local support for the line to be electrified, as an extension of the [[21st Century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line|planned electrification of the London to Bristol route]], and the level of service would be improved if proposals for the re-instatement of passenger services on the nearby Portishead Branch Line, which was re-opened for freight in 2001, are successful.

== Description ==

The station is built in a cutting in the western end of [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]], on the [[Bristol to Exeter Line]] {{convert|120|mi|16|chain|km|2}} from [[Paddington station|London Paddington]] and {{convert|1|mi|65|chain|km|2}} from {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}.<ref name="MLN">{{cite web|url=http://deaves47.zxq.net/ELRs/_mileages/M/MLN1.txt|title=Engineers' Line References: MLN1 Paddington to North Road Junction|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Deaves, Phil}}</ref> It is the second station along the line from Bristol Temple Meads.<ref name="Baker">{{cite book|first=S.K.|last=Baker|title=Rail Atlas of Great Britain and Ireland|edition=12|year=2010|isbn=978-0-86093-632-9|publisher=Ian Allan}}</ref> The surrounding area is mostly residential, with some industrial buildings to the north-east.<ref name="OS"/> There are two island platforms, each {{convert|210|yd|m}} long, but only the first {{convert|100|yd|m}} are in use, the rest fenced off. The platforms are on an alignment of roughly 60 degrees, with a slight curve. The southern island's northern face, platform 1, is for westbound trains; and the southern face of the northern island, platform 2, is for eastbound trains. The track on the southern side of the southern island has been removed, while the track to the northern side of the northern island is only accessible to trains to or from the [[Portishead Branch Line]] and Liberty Lane [[Freightliner Group Limited|Freightliner]] terminal - no passenger trains use this.

The station is surrounded on all sides by the [[A38 road]], which splits the carriageways at this point, with the station in between. The line runs under the road at both ends of the station.<ref name="OS">{{cite book |title=OS Landranger Map 172 - Bristol & Bath |year=2008 |publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]] |location=[[Southampton]] |isbn=978-0-319-22914-9}}</ref> Access between the platforms is via steps to the A38 at the east end of the platforms.

Facilities at the station are minimal - there is a metal and glass shelter on each of the two islands as well as on the bridge. The station is completely unstaffed, and there are no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. There is no car park or taxi rank, nor is there any cycle storage available.<ref name="nrfacilities"/> There are several bus stops nearby.<ref name="onward">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/posters/PSN.pdf|title=Parson Street Station: Onward Travel Information|publisher=[[Network Rail]]|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>

Just to the west of the station is Parson Street Junction, where the Portishead Branch diverges from the main line, heading north.<ref name="Yonge"/> The South Liberty Lane goods depot is adjacent to the junction, in the triangle between the main line, the Portishead Branch and the now-disused western connection between the branch and the main line.<ref name="bbcwine"/><ref name="iorw liberty">{{cite web|url=http://www.iorw.org/news_index.html|title=Rail industry news|quote=Network Rail and Freightliner have jointly reinstated a short section of disused track near Bristol Temple Meads enabling seven wine trains to terminate at South Liberty Lane depot every week.

== History ==
[[File:Coat of arms of the Great Western Railway.png|thumb|right|The [[Great Western Railway]] opened Parson Street railway station in 1927.]]
The first section of the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]]'s main line opened on 14 June 1841 between [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] and {{rws|Bridgwater}}.<ref name="MacDermot">{{cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway, vol. II: 1863<U+2013>1921 |year=1931 |publisher=[[Great Western Railway]] |location=Paddington |oclc=55853736 |pages=133<U+2013>4, 617 |ref=harv }}</ref> Engineered by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], the line was originally built as {{RailGauge|84}} [[broad-gauge]], but had been reconstructed as a [[mixed gauge]] line to accommodate local {{RailGauge|ussg}}-gauge traffic by 1 June 1875. Broad gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892.<ref name="MacDermot" /> The [[Portishead Branch Line]], which diverged from the [[Bristol to Exeter Line]] at Parson Street Junction, the other side of a road bridge west of where the station would be built, had opened on 12 July 1867. It was only in 1871, with the opening of a station at {{rws|Bedminster}} that there was a stop between the junction and Bristol Temple Meads.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite book|title=Bristol Railway Stations 1840<U+2013>2005|publisher=[http://www.redcliffepress.co.uk Redcliffe Press]|author=Oakley, Mike|year=2006|isbn=1-904537-54-5}}</ref>

As Bristol expanded in the early 20th century, the need for a new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the [[Great Western Railway]] opened a station at Parson Street, named ''Parson Street Halt''.{{#tag:ref|Sources are inconsistent about the name of the station - Oakley's book on Bristol railway stations says the station was called Parson Street Platform,<ref name="Oakley"/> while both Butt's directory and the work of Mitchell and Smith state it was Parson Street Halt.<ref name="Butt">{{Butt-Stations|page=181}}</ref><ref name="branch"/>|group=Note|name="Platform"}} There were two platforms, one on each side of the two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.<ref name="Oakley"/>

The station was rebuilt in the early 1930s to cope with the relaying of the line west from Temple Meads with four tracks instead of two. Considerable engineering works were needed to cope with the widening of the station, including the removal of a short tunnel to the west of the station. The two new island platforms opened on 21 May 1933,<ref name="Oakley"/> and the station name was changed to simply ''Parson Street'' in November 1933.<ref name="Butt"/> The new station included covered waiting shelters, and a booking office on the road bridge. Again, no goods facilities were provided.<ref name="Oakley"/>

Freight trains from [[Royal Portbury Docks]] are not an uncommon sight at Parson Street.]]
Parson Street railway station served a dual purpose: as well as serving local suburban developments for commuter and excursion traffic, it also acted as a minor interchange for passengers on the [[Portishead Branch Line]]. When Parson Street opened in 1927, there were 21 services each weekday along the branch, operated by the Great Western Railway at half-hour intervals from Temple Meads. There were 8 trains on Sundays.<ref name="branch"/><ref name="Yorke">{{cite book |title=Lost Railways of Somerset |author=Yorke, Stan |year=2007 |publisher=[[Countryside Books]] |location=[[Newbury, Berkshire]] |isbn=978-1-84674-057-2 |pages=113<U+2013>122}}</ref>

Following the [[Second World War]], service levels dropped dramatically along the Portishead branch. When the railways were [[nationalisation|nationalised]] in [[Transport Act 1947|1948]], services at Parson Street came under the auspices of the [[Western Region of British Railways]], and by the time the branch was closed to passengers in 1964, there were only six trains each weekday, and none on Sundays.<ref name="branch"/><ref name="Yorke"/> With the closure of the branch, Parson Street lost its interchange status, and in January 1971 the station buildings were demolished.<ref name="Oakley"/> Some special services did continue along the branch to {{rws|Ashton Gate}}, carrying fans to [[Bristol City FC]] games at the nearby [[Ashton Gate Stadium]]. These ceased in 1977, and Parson Street became the arrival and departure point for these trains.<ref name="Oakley"/>

The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw the Down Relief line, the most southern of the four running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage sidings to the east with the West Depot carriage sidings to the west. At the same time, Parson Street Junction was reworked, requiring trains to first cross from the Down Main line to the Up Main line before they were able to access the Portishead Branch.<ref name="branch">{{cite book|author1=Mitchell, Vic|author2=Smith, Keith|title=Branch Lines to Clevedon and Portishead|date=October 2003|publisher=[[Middleton Press]]|isbn=1-904474-18-7}}</ref> The Down Relief line was removed altogether when West Depot closed sometime after the opening of a new depot at [[St Philips Marsh]] to service [[High Speed Train]]s.<ref name="Yonge">{{cite book |last=Yonge |first=John |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=Gerald |title=Railway Track Diagrams 3: Western |edition=4th |year=2005 |month=November |origyear=1989 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=[[Bradford on Avon]] |isbn=0-9549866-1-X |at=map 5B |ref=harv }}</ref>

[[British Rail]] was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Bedminster passed to [[Regional Railways]]. Local services were franchised to [[Wales and West]] when the railway was [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatised]] in 1997,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/11/99/track_record/regions/west_southwest.stm|title=Track record: West and South-West|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]|date=November 1999|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=Frith, Malcolm}}</ref> which was in turn succeeded by [[Wessex Trains]], an arm of [[National Express]], in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesandwest.co.uk/|title=Wales and West|publisher=[[Wales and West]]|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref> The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to [[First Great Western]], a subsidiary company of [[First Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theironroad.net/Operator/Train-Operating-Companies-Defu/Wessex-Trains|title=Wessex Trains|work=The Iron Road: Railway Photography by Scott Borthwick|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4523592.stm|title=FirstGroup wins rail franchises|date=13 December 2005|accessdate=27 April 2012|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref><ref name="bids">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13351368|title=First Great Western bids for longer rail franchise deal|work=[[BBC News]]|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> 

In recent years, there has been a marked increase in passengers travelling to and from Parson Street. In the 2002/03 [[financial year]], less than 4,000 passengers used the station; and in 2005, only six eastbound and eight westbound trains called at Parson Street each day, with 14,293 passengers using the station during the 2005/06 financial year. Since then, service levels have increased to 21 westbound trains and 18 eastbound per weekday, and passenger levels have more than quadrupled, to 68,840 in 2010/11.<ref name="ORR">{{cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529|title=Station usage|publisher=[[Office of Rail Regulation]]}}</ref><ref group=Note>Annual estimated passenger usage based on sales of tickets in stated financial year(s) which end or originate at Parson Street from [[Office of Rail Regulation]] statistics.

In 2000/01, the track towards Portishead were relaid to allow rail access to [[Royal Portbury Docks]].<ref name="Yorke"/> In 2010, another section of track was reinstated to allow the reopening of South Liberty Lane depot to handle [[Trans Ocean]]'s wine import business, reducing road traffic. Seven trains terminate at the depot every week.

== Incidents ==
There have been several railway incidents in the Parson Street area over the years. On 19 November 2002, a [[Wessex Trains]] [[diesel multiple unit]] suffered an axle problem near Parson Street while operating a westbound service, causing the line to be blocked for four hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffandavonside.org.uk/Magazines/Old_Magazines/2003/0301mag.htm|title=January 2003|publisher=Cardiff & Avonside Railway Society|date=January 2003|accessdate=9 May 2012|quote=19/11 Following the failure of a Wessex Trains working around 17.30 near Parsons Street station, the down main was blocked for around four hours as the unit had suffered a serious axle problem.}}</ref> Delays all along the line to {{rws|Taunton}} have been caused by trackside cabling being stolen, affecting signalling between {{rws|Nailsea and Backwell}} and {{rws|Bedminster}}. Notable occurrences of this type happened in October 2006 and May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffandavonside.org.uk/Magazines/Old_Magazines/2006/0612mag.htm|title=December 2006|publisher=Cardiff & Avonside Railway Society|date=December 2006|accessdate=9 May 2012|quote=25/10 There were morning service delays as repairs were carried out to damaged trackside cabling near Parson's Street station which affected signalling between Bedminster and Nailsea around 06.00. It is thought the incident had been caused by vandals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/update_vandalism_causes_rail_misery_1_1384770|title=Update: Vandalism causes rail misery|author=Wright, Tom|work=[http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/ Weston, Worle and Somerset Mercury]|publisher=[[Archant Community Media]]|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> Theft of personal property has also occurred on the station. In 2009, a gang of teenagers robbed a group of four 12- to 15-year-old boys of their bikes at Parson Street. The robbers followed their targets off the train, having got on at {{rws|Weston-super-Mare}}, and attacked the boys as the train pulled away.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Bristol-train-gang-rob-teenagers-bikes/story-11284044-detail/story.html|title=Bristol train gang rob teenagers of their bikes|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=19 October 2009|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|work=[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk This is Bristol]}}</ref>
