The '''Siege of Mantua (1799)''' was a four-month effort by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] army to regain a presence in [[northern Italy]] after being excluded from that region by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] through the successful [[French First Republic|French]] [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|Siege of Mantua]] in 1797. In April 1799, the Austrians placed a [[military]] [[blockade]] around [[Mantua]] as part of the [[War of the Second Coalition]] with the intent of conquering the French by [[Attrition warfare|attrition]]. As their own attrition and diminishing food supplies weakened the Austrian army, they received reinforcements and [[Frontal assault|attacked]] on 4 July 1799. By the end of the month, the French agreed to [[capitulation (surrender)|surrender]].

==Prelude==

By 1799, the [[fortress of Mantua|fortress]] of [[Mantua]] on the river [[Mincio]] in northern Italy was in poor shape.<ref name="ObronaMantui6-7">Obrona Mantui..., p.6-7</ref> It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Philippe de Foissac-Latour]] (1750-1804)<ref>{{fr}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=ilsMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA361&dq=Philippe+Foissac-Latour&lr=&ei=mkVMSNqFDpXEigH8jKDmDQ Bibliographie biographique ou dictionnaire de 26000 ouvrages, tant anciens que modernes] (1750-1804)</ref> and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish ([[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legionnaires]] under general [[J<U+00F3>zef Wielhorski]]), Italian ([[Republic of Alba]] and [[Cisalpine Republic]]), Swiss and German units.<ref name="ObronaMantui6-7"/> From the beginning of his assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was convinced that the fortress would be indefensible in any serious [[siege]].<ref name="ObronaMantui6-7"/>

==Siege==

In April, Austrian forces approached Mantua and started their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, but with the artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.<ref name="ObronaMantui6-7"/>

On 18 June, the French suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Trebbia (1799)|Battle of Trebbia]], and consequently the Austrians were able to move more decisively against Mantua.<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9">Obrona Mantui..., p.8-9</ref> On 4 July the siege entered a new stage, with Austrian reinforcements arriving, and the besieging force growing from 8,000 to 40,000.<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/> The Austrians were commanded by Hungarian general Baron [[P<U+00E1>l Kray|Pal von Kray]], an artillery expert.<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/> Artillery bombardment was constant. On 24-25 July the assault begun; and the Austrians slowly advanced over the next few days.<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/> On 27 July Foissac-Latour began negotiating surrender terms.<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/>

==Capitulation==

The Austrians agreed to release most of the French garrison, keeping the officers for three months, and with soldiers pledging not to take arms until the prisoners were exchanged by the fighting sides.<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/> In a secret protocol, however, the Austrians demanded full sovereignty over "deserters from the Austrian army".<ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/> After protests from the Polish officers&nbsp;<U+2014> who were afraid that due to recent [[partitions of Poland]] in which Austria gained control over parts of Poland that the Austrians may want to take custody of the Polish legionnaires&nbsp;<U+2014> the Austrian negotiator clarified officially that they meant any deserters from the current Austrian army or former Austrian soldiers serving in the [[Cisalpine Republic]] Army. <ref name="ObronaMantui8-9"/>

On 30 July the French and allied troops left the fortress.<ref name="ObronaMantui1011">Obrona Mantui..., p.10-11</ref> The garrison troops were split into French and non-French units (of whom Poles still constituted 1,800); the Austrian soldiers observing the marching non-French garrison troops were given permission to physically assault those "recognized" as deserters and most of them were eventually arrested.<ref name="ObronaMantui1011"/> Polish officers&nbsp;<U+2014> particularly those from the [[Austrian partition]]&nbsp;<U+2014> were forced to enlist in the Austrian army or deported to partitioned Poland, and a similar fate befell Polish NCOs and regular soldiers, many of whom were also forced to suffer physical punishment by being beaten with rods.<ref name="ObronaMantui1011"/> This marked the end of the Second Legion of the Polish Legions.<ref name="PivkaRoffe1974">{{cite book|author1=Otto Von Pivka|author2=Michael Roffe|title=Napoleon's Polish Troops|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_0tVux3XN8YC&pg=PA6|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=15 June 1974|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-85045-198-6|page=6}}</ref> Foissac-Latour was later criticized by the Poles for what they considered "betrayal", but also by the French: for his surrender, Napoleon himself ordered Foissac-Latour stricken from the list of generals and forbade him to wear a military uniform.<ref name="ObronaMantui1011"/>
