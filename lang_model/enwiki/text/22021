The '''Windows Template Library''' ('''WTL''') is a [[free software]], [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[C++]] template [[Library (computer science)|library]] for [[Win32]] development. WTL was created by [[Microsoft]] employee Nenad Stefanovic for internal use and later released as an unsupported add-on to [[Visual Studio]] and the Win32 Framework SDK. It was developed primarily as a light-weight alternative to the [[Microsoft Foundation Classes]] and builds upon Microsoft's [[Active Template Library|ATL]], another lightweight API widely used to create [[Component Object Model|COM]] and [[ActiveX]] libraries.

==Overview==
WTL provides support for implementing various user interface elements, from frame and popup windows, to [[Multiple document interface|MDI]], standard and common controls, common dialogs, property sheets and pages, [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] objects, and other common UI elements, such as scrollable windows, splitter windows, toolbars and command bars. WTL's main objective is to deliver small and efficient code, close in size and speed to "straight" [[SDK]] programs while providing a higher-level and more flexible object model to developers. Other classes such as a string wrapper that is syntax-compatible with MFC's <code>CString</code> and some templated collections are also included.

Most of the WTL API is a mirror of the standard Win32 calls, so the interface tends to be familiar to most Windows programmers. Although no official documentation from Microsoft exists, the ''WTL Documentation Project'' is attempting to create a comprehensive reference for the library.<ref>[http://www.viksoe.dk/code/wtldoc.htm WTL documentation project]</ref> The WTL is not supported by [[Product Support Services|Microsoft Product Support Services]].

==Licensing==
While WTL is a template library and therefore code-based, the original license was similar to the one used for the [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library]] (MFC) source code, although it contained no usage or distribution restrictions. In 2004 Microsoft made the complete [[source code]] available under the [[Common Public License]] and released it through [[SourceForge]]. Since version 7.5, the library is also [[dual license]]d under the [[Microsoft Public License]].
