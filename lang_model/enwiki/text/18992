'''''Archipelago''''' is a 2010 British film written and directed by [[Joanna Hogg]] about a family [[Vacation|holiday]] on the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which forms part of the [[archipelago]] of the [[Isles of Scilly]].

==Plot==
A darkly comic and quietly moving portrayal of a family in emotional crisis. Before Edward ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) leaves to do voluntary work in Africa, his mother Patricia ([[Kate Fahy]]) gathers the family together on a remote island as a farewell trip to say goodbye to Edward. His sister Cynthia ([[Lydia Leonard]]) doesn't seem to want to be there, and although hired cook Rose (Amy Lloyd) and painting teacher Christopher ([[Christopher W. Baker|Christopher Baker]]) are brought in to help, they only serve to bring the family's anxieties to the surface. Grouped together on the island, and with their father's absence becoming increasingly conspicuous, the tensions and resentments within the family are drawn into sharper and sharper focus as the holiday progresses.
