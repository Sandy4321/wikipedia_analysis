'''Patrick Henry College''', or '''PHC''', is a private, non-denominational [[Protestant]] [[college]] that focuses on teaching classical [[liberal arts]] and [[government]], located in [[Purcellville, Virginia]]. It is the first college in America founded specifically for [[Christian]] [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] students,<ref>{{cite web | title=From Home to Harvard | publisher=TIME | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,53959,00.html | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Rosin | first=Hanna | authorlink=Hanna Rosin | date=September 03, 2000}}</ref> and is known for its [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian focus. As of [[April 17]], [[2007]], the college was nationally accredited by the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]], an accrediting organization recognized by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]].

The school was founded with the help of the [[Home School Legal Defense Association]], and now serves as the headquarters for  the organization, with which it is still closely connected. 

The college has gained much publicity because of its strong ties with the [[GOP|Republican Party]] and the Bush administration,<ref name=NewZealand>{{cite news

==History==
[[Image:Patrick Henry.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Patrick Henry College - Purcellville, Virginia]]Patrick Henry College was incorporated in 1998 by [[Michael P. Farris|Michael Farris]], founder of the [[Home School Legal Defense Association]]. It officially opened [[September 20]], [[2000]], with a class of 92 students. 

The school has been the subject of media attention from its inception, attracting reports from every major network and cable news organization, and being the subject of articles in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', and others. Most recently, the college was the subject of the [[television documentary]] ''God's Next Army'', which aired in the spring of 2006 on Britain's [[Channel 4]] and the [[Discovery Times Channel]] in the United States.<ref name=Godsnextarmy>{{cite web | title=<U+FEFF>God's Next Army | publisher=Chanel 4 | url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/godsarmy.html | accessdate=2007-06-13 }}</ref> Initial media interest stemmed from the fact that the college deliberately sought students with [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web | title=Distinctives and Nonnegotiable Principles | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/about/DistinctivesNonnegotiables.asp | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>  As time went on, it also attracted notice because of a perceived closeness with the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]], which had given the school's students a number of White House [[internship]]s and opportunities. In the spring of 2004, of the almost 100 student [[intern]]s working in the White House, seven were from Patrick Henry College, which had only 240 students at the time.<ref>{{cite news

In a dispute in March of 2006, five of the college's sixteen faculty members&mdash;Erik Root, Robert Stacey, Kevin Culberson, Todd Bates, and David Noe&mdash;resigned in protest, claiming that the President's interpretation of the college's Biblical Worldview policy, which all faculty must sign, restricted [[academic freedom]].<ref name=pbs>{{cite web | title=Interview: Erik Root | publisher=PBS | work=Religion & Ethics Newsweekly (PBS) | url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week939/interview2.html | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Lawton | first=Kim | date=May 26, 2006}}</ref> <ref name=latimes>{{cite web | title=A Clash of Ideas at Evangelical College | publisher=LA Times | work=5 of Patrick Henry's 16 faculty members leave over its mission and curriculum | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1036057571.html?dids=1036057571:1036057571&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+13%2C+2006&author=Molly+Hennessy-Fiske&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.4&desc=THE+NATION | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Henessy-Fiske | first=Molly | date=May 13, 2006}}</ref> All resulting faculty vacancies were filled by the beginning of the fall 2006 semester.<ref>{{cite web | title=Faculty Positions at PHC Filled | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/news/docs/07282006Media.asp | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Halbrook | first= David | date=May 28, 2006}}</ref>

Farris announced his resignation as president of the college on [[March 6]], [[2006]], to take on a new role as [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]]. Graham Walker, formerly of [[Oklahoma Wesleyan University]], was named the new president on [[April 3]]. Farris' resignation took effect once Walker assumed the role and responsibilities of president in July 2006.

In April 2006, the college named author and educator Gene Edward Veith as Academic Dean. Formerly the cultural editor of ''[[World (magazine)|WORLD Magazine]]'', Veith began his new position on [[July 1]], [[2006]].<ref name=pbs>{{cite web | title=Interview: Erik Root | publisher=PBS | work=Religion & Ethics Newsweekly (PBS) | url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week939/interview2.html | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Lawton | first=Kim | date=May 26, 2006}}</ref><ref name=phc01>{{cite web | title=Patrick Henry College Names New Academic Dean | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/news/docs/05102006Media.asp | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Halbrook | first=David | date=May 10, 2006}}</ref> As part of multiple structural and administrative changes implemented in November 2006, Veith was appointed to the position of provost and oversees the departments of Academic Affairs and Student Life.

Classes began in 2000 with 92 students, and the school has since grown to approximately 325 students. As of 2007, most students are white, with some Asians and Latinos. There is one African American student.<ref name=BumpyBusRide>{{cite web | title=<U+FEFF>Young, Gay Christians On a Bumpy Bus Ride | publisher=The Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041202438.html?hpid=sec-artsliving | accessdate=2007-05-29 | last=Rosin | first=Hanna | date=April 13, 2007}}</ref>

Patrick Henry College receives all of its funding from tuition money or personal donors.  The college states that it does not accept any money "from government, or any other source that includes terms which supersede the authority of our Board of Trustees or conflict with our foundational statements. Patrick Henry College also operates without debt, adding new facilities and programs only as funds are available. Instead, we rely heavily on the generous giving of families across the country to meet our financial obligations." <ref>{{cite web | title=How Can I Support PHC | url=http://www.phc.edu/support/default.asp | accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> The Home School Legal Defense Association remains one of the primary benefactors of the school and all members of the association receive a one-thousand dollar grant if accepted as students.<ref>{{cite news

==Religious Affirmations==
All students sign a Statement of Faith before they arrive, affirming belief in what the college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, students are asked to acknowledge "[[Satan]] exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom [[Hell]], the place of [[eternal]] punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity," and that "[[Christ]]'s death provides substitutionary [[atonement]] for our [[sin]]s."<ref>{{cite web | title=Statement of Faith | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/about/faith.asp | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> The college has [[non-denominational]] [[Christian]] beliefs. 

Teaching faculty must also sign a statement of faith and "Biblical Worldview"<ref name=BiblicalWorldview>{{cite web | title=Statement of Biblical Worldview | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/about/BiblicalWorldview.asp | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> stating that they believe that the [[Bible]] is the authoritative word of God. This includes the biblical account of the creation of the world, sometimes referred to as [[Young Earth creationism|six-day creation]]. The claims of both [[evolution]] and [[creation (theology)|creation]] are part of the curriculum at Patrick Henry, though the college's official position on the issue is that six-day creation is "both biblically true and is the best fit to observed data".<ref name=BiblicalWorldview>{{cite web | title=Statement of Biblical Worldview | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/about/BiblicalWorldview.asp | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> New Scientist, a science publication, has claimed that Patrick Henry College and the homeschooling community in general are "possibly threatening the public school system that has fought hard against imposing a Christian viewpoint on science teaching."<ref name=NewScience>{{cite news

On [[April 12]], [[2007]], [[Soulforce (organization)|Soulforce]], a group advocating the acceptance of a variety of sexual practices, selected Patrick Henry College as the location for one of the group's stops on its annual "Equality Ride," the purpose of which is to protest the stance of conservative Christian colleges concerning homosexuality. Like many other Christian colleges, Patrick Henry did not allow Soulforce to enter the univeristy premises, though the college did offer to send student representatives to conduct a formal debate at a neutral location on the merits of the proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref name=FedMarriage>{{cite news

The largest and most prominent structure, Founders Hall, opened in 2000 and contains three classrooms, a dining hall, a library, a weight room, and various administrative and faculty offices. It is also home to the offices of the Home School Legal Defense Association. 

The school's residential village is composed of five residence halls located along the edges of the lake. There are two men's dorms (Red Hill and Oak Hill) and three women's dorms (Mount Vernon, Monticello, and Montpelier). The four smaller dorms opened in 2001, while the largest residence hall, Red Hill, opened in 2003.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dorm Life | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/studentlife/DormLife.asp | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> In addition to student housing, Red Hill also contains three classrooms and an office suite on its basement level. Located in the basement of Mount Vernon is an auditorium referred to as Town Hall, where the school's daily chapel sessions and other special events are held.

The college is currently in the process of constructing a 105,000-square-foot Student Life Center, which when completed will house a new food court, an indoor gymnasium and running track, and multiple other athletic facilities. Construction of the building's superstructure began in late November 2006.<ref>{{cite news

==Academics==
Students at the school can specialize within one of two tracks of study: Government or Classical Liberal Arts. The Government department offers majors in Government and the option to specialize in [[public policy|Domestic Policy]], International Policy, Political Theory, [[Espionage|Strategic Intelligence]], or an "undeclared general" government track.  Patrick Henry College also offers a degree in [[Journalism]], while the Classical Liberal Arts department offer degrees in [[Classical education|Classical Liberal Arts Education]], [[History]], and [[Literature]].

The Government department's Public Policy degree was the first one offered by the college, and is still largely seen as its "[[flagship]]" program, with close connections to the [[George W. Bush]] administration, Washington, DC [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and conservative [[think tank]]s and organizations. In late November 2006, the school announced plans to split this track into separate domestic and foreign policy tracks.

The college has a 100% placement rate among graduates who have applied to law school, with the majority of students receiving admission to [[Law school in the United States#Top tier law schools|first tier]] law schools, such as [[Georgetown Law School]] and [[University of Virginia Law School]],

Patrick Henry offers many of its core classes online, utilizing ANGEL technology.  ANGEL is an online program which hosts chats, forums, uploads, and email for students.  This website enables students to participate in a class with other students from their own homes.  Tuition for the program is less than the cost of on-campus education.

Of the twenty-five full-time professors, twenty-one have at least one [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], one is a candidate for the Ph.D.,<ref>{{cite web | title=Department of Classical Liberal Arts Professors | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/academics/liberalarts/default.asp | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web | title=Department of Government Professors | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/academics/government/default.asp | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> one professor has a [[D.M.A.]], another holds an [[Ed.D.]], and one of the professors, who is also the founder and chancellor, [[Mike Farris]], has a [[J.D.]].<ref name=catalog>[http://www.phc.edu/admissions/catalog/Final%202006-7%20catalog.pdf Academic Catalog] Retrieved on: May 25, 2007</ref>

===Political Views===
Patrick Henry College has been criticized for what some see as extreme [[conservatism]] and evangelical Christian [[ethos]], including [[creationism]] and its [[pro-life]] stance by many newspapers such as, the New Zealand Herald,<ref name=NewZealand>{{cite news

===Civic Involvement===
Patrick Henry College's educational model emphasizes both a firm grounding in classical liberal arts and active hands-on experience in students' areas of study. As a result, it encourages students to participate in off-campus activities and real-world activism outside the college experience. Government students are required to fulfill up to 24 credits of apprenticeship projects, which include internships, research and writing projects, and extracurricular activities such as [[Moot Court]] and [[Model United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Bachelor of Arts in the Government Major | publisher=Patrick Henry College | url=http://www.phc.edu/academics/government/bagovernment.asp | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> Students currently serve as interns in a wide variety of organizations, including the White House, congressional offices, and think-tanks. Students are active in local and national politics, and members of the Patrick Henry College [[College Republicans]] chapter often work with local political action groups to lobby for conservative issues at the federal and state levels. Classes are canceled the Monday before and Tuesday of the national elections so that students may volunteer on political campaigns if they so choose; and many students act as Student Action Team leaders for [[Generation Joshua]], leading groups of usually homeschooled high school students volunteering on campaigns across the United States. A number of students  volunteer with the Purcellville Rescue Squad, The Vibe (formerly known as the Purcellville Teen Center),<ref>{{cite web | title=Volunteering at The Vibe at Purcellville Teen Center | publisher=Purcellville Teen Center | url=http://www.the-teen-center.com/volunteers.html | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> and one student currently serves on Purcellville's Planning Commission.<ref>{{cite news

==Student life==

[[Image:Bobtism.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A male student is dunked in Lake Bob after announcing his engagement.]]As of November 2006, The Student Life Department is presided over by Administrative Dean for Student Life, Sandra Corbitt, and falls under the authority of the Provost. The college has many rules of behavior typical of conservative, religious colleges. Students may not show [[Public display of affection|public displays of affection]] in college buildings. Students may not have sex outside of marriage, or use [[alcohol]] or [[tobacco]]  while under the authority of the college, which is defined as any time during a semester while enrolled, on or off campus. Men and women are not allowed in each others' dorm rooms, and underclassmen are subject to a curfew. Firearms are prohibited on campus.<ref name=StudentHandbook>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref>  The college has a number of traditions rooted in dorm life, including "bobtisms"--a [[portmanteau]] of [[Baptism]] and "Lake Bob," in which newly-affianced males are dunked. <ref>{{cite web | title=Izzy's Bobtism | publisher=HomeSchoolDebate Forum | url=http://www.homeschooldebate.com/phorum/viewtopic.php?p=42541&sid=6941127efcc5d7a9600a6be1871ba729 | accessdate=2007-06-02 | last=Dark Lord of Debate | date=September 25, 2005}}</ref>

Dancing is not allowed on campus, but students hold several school dances off-campus, including the annual spring Liberty Ball, usually held at a historic Civil War era manor or plantation. The first dance, held during Patrick Henry College's inaugural year on the anniversary of [[Patrick Henry]]'s famous "[[Give me liberty or give me death]]" speech of [[March 23]] [[1775]], was organized by a parent and has since been assumed by student coordinators. The annual Valentine's Day Dance and fall Hoedown are other popular dances.

Students are active in multiple campus clubs including the [[College Republicans]], Eden Troupe (which produces regular stage dramas), the Streaming Media Network (which produces student films), and several philosophical and literary societies. Students also participate in the school's student government, which consists of a student senate comprised of approximately 25 members, elected every fall semester; and a student president and vice president who run as a ticket and are elected every spring semester. Though it serves primarily as an advisory body to the college administration, it does have limited powers to enact campus policies and is considered an important part of life at Patrick Henry College.[[Image:PHC Debate Team.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Patrick Henry College has brought multiple trophies in every category that they compete in [[National Educational Debate Association|NEDA]].]] 	
===Debate===

Students also compete in the American Collegiate Moot Court Association (ACMA), and had the winning teams at both the 2005 and 2006 ACMA National Tournaments. Moot court is a form of debate competition designed to simulate appellate arguments before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], in which teams of two students function as co-counsels and stand before a panel of judges to argue legal matters. Patrick Henry College won the ACMA National Tournaments back-to-back years in 2004 and 2005.<ref name=Mike>{{cite news
