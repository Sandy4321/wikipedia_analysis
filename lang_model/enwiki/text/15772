'''''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''''' ([[1865]]) is a work of [[literary nonsense]] written by [[England|English]] author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the [[pseudonym]] [[Lewis Carroll]], considered a classic example of the genre and of English literature in general.<ref>BBC's Greatest English Books list</ref> It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a [[Rabbit hole|rabbit-hole]] into a fantastic realm populated by peculiar and [[anthropomorphic]] creatures.

The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize.  The tale plays with [[logic]] in ways that have made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as children.  It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of [[literary nonsense]], and its [[narrative]] course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the fantasy genre (see [[Works influenced by Alice in Wonderland|''Works influenced by ''Alice in Wonderland]]).

The book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title '''''Alice in Wonderland''''', an alternative title popularized by the numerous stage, film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''.

==History==
''Alice'' was first published on [[4 July]] [[1865]], exactly three years after the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend [[Robinson Duckworth]] rowed in a boat up the [[River Thames]] with three little girls:<ref>[http://www.the-office.com/bedtime-story/alice-background.htm].  [[Bedtime Stories]] History of Alice.  Retrieved [[January 29]], [[2007]].</ref>

*Lorina Charlotte Liddell (aged 13) ("Prima" in the book's prefatory verse)
*[[Alice Liddell|Alice Pleasance Liddell]] (aged 10) ("Secunda" in the prefatory verse)
*Edith Mary Liddell (aged 8) ("Tertia" in the prefatory verse)

The journey had started at [[Folly Bridge]] near [[Oxford]] and ended five miles away in the village of [[Godstow]]. To while away time the Reverend Dodgson told the girls a story that, not so coincidentally, featured a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure.

The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson to write it down for her. After a lengthy delay - over two years -  he eventually did so and on [[26 November]] [[1864]] gave Alice the  manuscript of ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground''.  Some, including [[Martin Gardner]], speculate there was an earlier version that was  destroyed later by Dodgson himself when he printed a more elaborate copy by hand (Gardner, 1965), but there is no known prima facie evidence to support this.
 
But before Alice received her copy, MS Dodgson was already preparing it for publication and expanding the 18,000-word original to 35,000 words, most notably adding the episodes about the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Tea-Party.<!-- The event and the chapter are ***NOT*** "The Mad Hatter's Tea-Party", they are "The Mad Tea-Party"; it wasn't even at the Mad Hatter's house... --> In 1865, Dodgson's tale was published as ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' by "[[Lewis Carroll]]" with illustrations by [[John Tenniel]]. The first print run of 2,000 was destroyed because Tenniel had objections over the print quality. (Only 23 copies are known to have survived; 18 are owned by major [[archive]]s  or [[library|libraries]], such as the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]], while the other five are held in private hands.) A new edition, released in December of the same year but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed.

The entire print run sold out quickly. ''Alice'' was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were young [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. The book has never been out of print. ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' has been translated into 125 languages, including [[Esperanto]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film.

==Synopsis==

[[Image:Alicesadventuresinwonderland1898.jpg|thumb|250px|right|cover of the 1898 edition]]
	
===Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole===
Alice is sitting by her sister lazily and became a bit tired, and she sees a White Rabbit in a waistcoat carrying a watch. She follows it down a rabbit hole, and falls down a very long chamber full of strange things on shelves. After landing safely on the ground, she goes into a long hallway with a glass table with a gold key. Alice opens up a curtain and finds a small door, which the key fits in perfectly, and behind it is a beautiful garden, but she can't fit in. Alice then finds a small bottle labeled "DRINK ME," and drinks it. The drink causes her to shrink. Alice accidentally leaves the key on the table, and with her diminished stature can no longer reach it and becomes very scared. She then sees a cake that says "EAT ME," and proceeds to eat it.

===Chapter 2: The Pool of Tears===
The consumption of the cake makes Alice grow to be 9 feet tall.  She cries, creating a pool of tears.  The White Rabbit comes into the hallway, and is so frightened he drops his fan and kid-gloves.  Alice then fans herself with his fan and kid-gloves, causing her to shrink again, but she stops before she goes out altogether.  She swims through the pool of tears she had cried when she was larger, and finds a mouse who is awfully scared of cats.  They wash up onto a bank, where they meet many birds and animals, who are also soaking wet.

===Chapter 3: A Caucus Race and a Long Tale===
A [[Dodo]] decides that the birds and animals should dry off with a Caucus Race, which has no rules except to run in a circle.  After half an hour or so, the race ends and everyone wins, which means they all get prizes.  Alice gives out her [[comfit]]s as the prizes, and the Mouse tells Alice his long and sad tale of why he hates cats, which Alice misinterprets as "tail."  The chapter ends with Alice alienating the participants of the race, resulting in her being left alone once again.

===Chapter 4: The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill===
The White Rabbit mistakes Alice for his house maid, Mary Ann. He asks her to fetch a pair of gloves and a fan.  Alice goes in to his house, and she finds a bottle. Though not labeled DRINK ME she drinks it anyway.  The drink now makes her grow so big that she blocks the entrance and the White Rabbit is no longer able to get into the house.  The White Rabbit asks a lizard named Bill to get her out.  Bill climbs in through the chimney, but is kicked out by Alice's giant leg that is stuck there.  The White Rabbit then decides out loud that house should be burned down, where Alice then responds fervently "If you do I'll set Dinah at you!", Dinah being a young kitten that Alice owns. Silence follows and then chatter about 'A barrowful will do, to begin with' followed by a shower of little pebbles being thrown through the window. The pebbles quickly turn into small cakes and Alice swallows one, suddenly causing her to shrink again to her earlier size.  Back down to size Alice makes her way out of the house to find a small crowd of assorted animals, who in turn make a rush toward Alice when they see her. Quickly retreating into the nearby thick wood she finds herself confronted by an enormous puppy (note that Alice is merely a few inches tall at this time) and plays fetch with the puppy, tiring him into sleep. She rests for a moment herself, looking around and spotting a mushroom growing near her, she examines all angles of the mushroom and decides to have a peek at what might be on top of it. As she stands tiptoe and looks, her eyes meet with the ones of a blue Caterpillar, who is sitting arms folded quietly smoking a [[hookah]].

===Chapter 5: Advice from a Caterpillar===
Alice asks how she can get bigger, but the Caterpillar asks her to recite "Old Father William" instead.  After doing so (with a few errors), the Caterpillar tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her bigger and the other side will make her smaller.  The Caterpillar disappears leaving Alice all alone.  Alice first tries the right side, which makes her chin get stuck to her foot.  Then she tries the left side, which makes her neck grow very long.  A pigeon flies into her face, believing she is a serpent, but Alice tells her that she is a little girl.  She then eats different sides of the mushroom and gets back to her usual height.

===Chapter 6: Pig and Pepper===
Now at her right size, Alice comes upon a house with a Frog-Footman and a Fish-Footman in front.  The Fish-Footman has an invitation for the Duchess, which he delivers to the Frog-Footman.  Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, goes into the house and meets The Duchess, The Cook, The Baby, and The Duchess's Cheshire-Cat.  The Cook is throwing dishes and making a soup which has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess and the baby, but not the cook or the Cheshire-Cat, to sneeze.  The Duchess tosses her baby up and down while reciting the poem "Speak roughly to your little boy."  When the poem is over, The Duchess gives Alice the baby while she leaves to go play [[croquet]] with the Queen.  To Alice's surprise, the baby later turns into a pig, so she lets it go off into the woods.  The Cheshire-Cat then appears in a tree, telling her about the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.  He then disappears, his grin remaining behind to float on its own in the air.

===Chapter 7: A Mad Tea Party===
Alice becomes a guest at a mad tea party, along with the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse.  In the course of the party, Alice reveals that the date is May 4 (which happens to be the birthday of her presumed real-life counterpart, Alice Pleasance Liddell). The other characters give Alice many riddles and stories, until she becomes so insulted that she leaves, claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to. Alice comes upon a door in a tree, and enters it, and finds herself back in the long hallway. She opens the door, eats part of her mushroom, and shrinks so she can get into the beautiful garden.

===Chapter 8: The Queen's Croquet Ground===
Now in the beautiful garden, she comes upon 3 cards painting the roses on a rose tree red, for they accidentally planted a white-rose tree which the Queen of Hearts hates.  A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit comes into the garden.  She meets the violent Queen of Hearts and the less violent King of Hearts.  The Queen tells the executioner to chop off the three card gardeners' heads.  

A game of croquet begins, with flamingos as the mallets and hedgehogs as the balls.  The Queen condemns more people to death, and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat, who asks her how the queen is.  The Queen of Hearts then tries to find out how they can chop off the Cheshire Cat's head, even though he is only a floating head.  Alice asks her about the Duchess, so the Queen asks the executioner to get the Duchess out of prison.

===Chapter 9: The Mock Turtle's story===
The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground.  She is now less angry and is always trying to find morals in things (she claims the pepper made her angry.)  The Queen of Hearts then shows Alice the Gryphon, who takes her to the Mock Turtle.  The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow.  He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a turtle, which The Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.

===Chapter 10: The Lobster Quadrille===
The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon start dancing to the Lobster Quadrille, singing "Tis the Voice of the Lobster."  The Mock Turtle then sings "Beautiful Soup" during which Alice and The Gryphon have to leave for a trial while The Mock Turtle continues singing.

===Chapter 11: Who Stole the Tarts?===
At the trial, the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the tarts.  The jury box is made up of twelve animals, including Bill the Lizard, and the judge is the King of Hearts.  The first witness is the Mad Hatter, who doesn't help the case at all. In some versions, the second witness is the Duchess's cook.  The next and last witness though, is Alice.

===Chapter 12: Alice's Evidence===
Alice eats part of the mushroom, causing her to grow and accidentally knocks over the Jury Box.  The Queen of Hearts is about to sentence them to death, but Alice calls them all just a pack of cards, causing them to swirl around her and turn into dead leaves.  Alice's sister wakes her up, since it was all a dream.  Alice tells her sister all about the strange dream she had just awoken from.

===Misconception of characters===
Although [[Tweedledee]], [[Tweedledum]], [[Humpty Dumpty]], and the [[Jabberwocky|Jabberwock]] are often thought to be characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', they actually only appear later in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.  They are, however, often included in film versions, which are usually simply called "Alice in Wonderland," often causing the confusion.

====Character allusions====
The members of the boating party that first heard Carroll's tale all show up in Chapter 3 ("A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale") in one form or another. There is, of course, Alice herself, while Carroll, or Charles Dodgson, is caricatured as the Dodo. Carroll is known as the Dodo because Dodgson stuttered when he spoke, thus if he spoke his last name it would be ''Do-Do''-Dodgson. The Duck refers to Rev. Robinson Duckworth, the Lory to Lorina Liddell, and the Eaglet to Edith Liddell.

Bill the Lizard may be a play on the name of [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  One of Tenniel's illustrations in ''Through the Looking-Glass'' depicts a caricature of Disraeli, wearing a paper hat, as a passenger on a train.  The illustrations of the Lion and the Unicorn also bear a striking resemblance to Tenniel's ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrations of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and Disraeli.

The Hatter is most likely a reference to [[Theophilus Carter]], a furniture dealer known in [[Oxford]] for his unorthodox inventions. Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on a suggestion of Carroll's.

The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. These are the Liddell sisters: Elsie is L.C. (Lorina Charlotte), Tillie is Edith (her family nickname is Matilda), and Lacie is an [[anagram]] of Alice.

The Mock Turtle speaks of a Drawling-master, "an old conger eel", that used to come once a week to teach "Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils". This is a reference to the art critic [[John Ruskin]], who came once a week to the Liddell house to teach the children ''drawing'', ''sketching'', and ''painting in oils''. (The children did, in fact, learn well; Alice Liddell, for one, produced a number of skilled watercolours.)

The Mock Turtle also sings "Turtle Soup". This is a parody of a song called "Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star", which was performed as a trio by Lorina, Alice and Edith Liddell for Lewis Carroll  in the Liddell home during the same summer in which he first told the story of Alice's Adventures Under Ground (source: the diary of Lewis Carroll, [[August 1]], [[1862]] entry).

===Tenniel's illustrations===
[[John Tenniel]]'s illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell, who had dark hair and a short fringe. Carroll sent Tenniel a photograph of Mary Hilton Babcock, another child-friend, but whether Tenniel actually used Babcock as his model is open to dispute.

===Famous lines and expressions===
The term "[[Wonderland]]", from the title, has entered the language and refers to a marvellous imaginary place, or else a real-world place that one perceives to have dream like qualities. It, like much of the ''Alice'' work, is widely [[Works influenced by Alice in Wonderland|referred to in popular culture]].

[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 02.png|right|thumb|175px|The White Rabbit.]]
"Down the Rabbit-Hole", the '''Chapter 1''' title, has become a popular term for going on an adventure into the unknown. In [[computer gaming]], a "rabbit hole" may refer to the initiating element that drives the player to enter the game. In [[drug culture]], "going down the rabbit hole" is a metaphor for taking drugs.

In '''Chapter 6''', the Cheshire Cat's disappearance prompts Alice to say one of her most memorable lines: "...a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!"

In '''Chapter 7''', the Hatter gives his famous [[riddle]] without an answer: "Why is a [[raven]] like a writing desk?" Although Carroll intended the riddle to have no solution, in a new preface to the 1896 edition of ''Alice'', he proposes several answers: "Because it can produce a few notes, though<U+2026> they are very flat; and it is nevar put with the wrong end in front!" (Note the spelling of "never" as "nevar"&mdash;turning it into "raven" when inverted. This spelling, however, was "corrected" in later editions to "never" and Carroll's pun was lost). Puzzle expert [[Sam Loyd]] offered the following solutions: 
*Because the notes for which they are noted are not noted for being musical notes 
*[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both 
*They both have inky quills
*Bills and tales are among their characteristics
*Because they both stand on their legs, conceal their steels (steals), and ought to be made to shut up 
Many other answers are listed in ''[[The Annotated Alice]]''.
In [[Frank Beddor]]'s novel ''[[Seeing Redd]]'', the main antagonist, [[Queen Redd]]  (a [[megalomaniac]] parody of the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]]) meets Lewis Carroll and declares that the answer to the riddle is "Because I say so." Carroll is too terrified to contradict her.

Arguably the most famous quote is used when the Queen of Hearts screams "Off with her head!" at Alice (and everyone else she feels slightly annoyed with). Possibly Carroll here was echoing a scene in [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (III, iv, 76) where Richard demands the execution of [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord Hastings]], crying "Off with his head!"

When Alice is growing taller after eating the cake labeled "Eat me" she says, "curiouser and curiouser", a famous line that is still used today to describe an event with extraordinary wonder.

==Symbolism in the text==
===References to mathematics===
Since Carroll was a mathematician at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], it has been suggested<ref name=more_annotated>{{cite book | last=Gardner | first=Martin | title=More Annotated Alice | location=New York | publisher=Random House | pages=363 | date=1990 | isbn =0-394-58571-2}}</ref> that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and also in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''; examples include:
* In chapter 1, "Down the Rabbit-Hole", in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps "''going out altogether, like a candle.''"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].
* In chapter 2, "The Pool of Tears", Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: "''Let me see:  four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''". This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (mathematics)|bases]] and [[positional]] [[numeral systems]] (4 x 5 = 12 in base 18 notation; 4 x 6 = 13 in base 21 notation. 4 x 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation, following the sequence).
* In chapter 5, "Advice from a Caterpillar", the Pigeon asserts that little girls are some kind of serpent, for both little girls and serpents eat eggs. This general concept of abstraction occurs widely in many fields of science; an example in mathematics of employing this reasoning would be in [[Substitution of variables|the substitution of variables]].
* In chapter 7, "A Mad Tea-Party", the March Hare, the Mad Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the inverse of '''A''' (for example, "''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing an [[inverse relation]]ship.
* Also in chapter 7, Alice ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] of the integers [[modulo]] N.

===References to the French language===
It has been suggested by several people including [[Martin Gardner]] and [[Selwyn Goodacre]]<ref name=more_annotated/> that Dodgson had an interest in the [[French language]], choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessons which would have been a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. A sampling of these include:
* In chapter 2, "The Pool of Tears", Alice imagines sending a present to her own foot; she addresses the foot as ''Alice's Right Foot, Esq.''. [[Esquire]] is the description of a person whose [[gender]] is male; it has been suggested<ref name=more_annotated/> that this is a play on the French word for foot. The word in French is ''le pied'', and due to the rules of the language concerning [[Grammatical gender|noun gender]], will always be addressed as masculine regardless of the gender of the owner of the foot.
* Also in chapter 2, Alice posits that the mouse may be French and chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: "''O<U+00F9> est ma chatte?'''", or "Where is my cat?"

===References to classical languages===
* In chapter 2, Alice initially addresses the mouse as "O Mouse", based on her vague memory of the noun [[declension]]s in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|textbook]]: "A mouse ([[nominative]])-- of a mouse ([[genitive]])-- to a mouse ([[dative]])-- a mouse ([[accusative]])-- O mouse! ([[vocative]])". This corresponds to the traditional order that was established by Byzantine grammarians (and is still in standard use, except in the United Kingdom and some countries in Western Europe) for the five cases of Classical Greek; because of the absence of the [[ablative]] case, which Greek does not have but is found in Latin, the reference is apparently not to the latter as some have supposed.

===Historical references===
* In chapter 8, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, for they accidentally planted a white-rose tree which the [[Queen of Hearts]] hates.  Red roses symbolized the English [[House of Lancaster]], while white roses were the symbol for their rival [[House of York]].  Therefore, this scene contains a hidden allusion to the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref>[http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/explain/alice8xx.html Other explanations | Lenny's Alice in Wonderland site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Live performance==
Lewis Carroll's most famous work has also inspired numerous live performances, including [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s.  These works range from adaptations which are fairly faithful to the original book to those which use the story as a basis for new works.  A good example of the latter is ''[[The Eighth Square]]'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland. Written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and Music & Lyrics by [[Ben J Macpherson]]. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the New Theatre Royal in [[Portsmouth]], [[England]].

With the immediate popularity of the book, it didn't take long for live performances to begin.  One early example is ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', a [[musical theatre|musical play]] by [[H. Saville Clark]] (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played in [[1886]] at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in [[London]].  

Over the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions.  One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[1980]] staging of ''[[Alice in Concert]]'' at the [[Public Theater]] in [[New York City]].  [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music.  Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]].  [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty.  The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe.

A free theatre script of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' is available from FunAntics Theater Scripts [http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/theaterscripts/alice.html here]. It includes the original poems that schoolchildren were expected to recite such as "You are Old Father William" and "The Voice of the Sluggard" which Lewis Carroll satirized.

Similarly, the [[1992]] operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration.  However, it also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story.  Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music.  Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (album)|Alice]]'' in 2002, to much acclaim.

In addition to professional performances, school productions abound.  Both high schools and colleges have staged numerous versions of ''Alice''-inspired performances.  The imaginative story and large number of characters are well-suited to such productions.

A large-scale operatic adaptation of the story by the Korean composer [[Unsuk Chin]] to an English language libretto by [[David Henry Hwang]] received its world premiere at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] on [[June 30]], [[2007]].

==Criticism==	 
The book was generally received in a positive light, but has also caught a large amount of derision for its strange and unpredictable tone. One of the best-known critics is fantasy writer [[Terry Pratchett]], who has openly stated that he dislikes the book.<ref>[http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html "Words from the Master"].  Retrieved from Unseen University [[January 29]], 2007.</ref>

In [[1931]], the book was [[list of banned books|banned]] in [[Hunan]], China because "animals should not use human language" and it "put animals and human beings on the same level."<ref>[http://sshl.ucsd.edu/banned/books.html "Banned Books Week: September 25-October 2].  [[University of California, San Diego]] Social Sciences & Humanities Library.  Retrieved [[January 29]], 2007.</ref>

==Works influenced==
{{main|Works influenced by Alice in Wonderland}}
Alice and the rest of Wonderland continue to inspire or influence many other works of art to this day, sometimes indirectly via the [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Disney movie]], for example. The character of the plucky, yet proper, Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage.<!--Instead of expanding this section, please add information to the works influenced article above.-->
