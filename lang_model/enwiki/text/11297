The '''''Mayflower''''' was the famous [[ship]] that transported the English Separatists, better known as the [[Pilgrims]], from [[Southampton]], [[England]], to [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts]] (which would become the capital of [[Plymouth Colony]]), in 1620.<ref name=sos>{{cite web|

The ''Mayflower'' has a famous place in American history as a symbol of early European colonization of the future US. With their religion oppressed by the English Church and government,<ref name="Philbrick4_5">[[#Philbrick|Philbrick]], pp. 4-5</ref> the small party of religious separatists who comprised about half of the passengers on the ship desired a life where they could practice their religion freely.  This symbol of religious freedom resonates in US society and the story of the Mayflower is a staple of any American history textbook.  Americans whose roots are traceable back to New England often believe themselves to be descended from ''Mayflower'' passengers.

The [[#Bradford|main record]] for the voyage of the Mayflower and the disposition of the Plymouth Colony comes from [[William Bradford]] who was a guiding force and later the [[governor]] of the [[colony]].

[[Image:Cape cod bay.jpg|thumb|''Mayflower'' arrived inside the tip of [[Cape Cod]] fishhook, [[11 November]]/[[21 November]] [[1620]]]]

==Ship==

The ''Mayflower'' was used primarily as a cargo ship, involved in active trade of goods (often wine) between England and other European countries,<ref name="Philbrick24"/><ref name=MHcrew/>
(principally [[France]], but also [[Norway]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]]). At least between 1609 and 1622, it was mastered by [[Christopher Jones (sailor)|Christopher Jones]], who would command the ship on the famous transatlantic voyage, and based in [[Rotherhithe]], London, England.<ref name=sos/>  After the famous voyage of the Mayflower, the ship returned to England, likely dismantled for scrap lumber in Rotherhithe in 1623, only a year after Jones's death in March 1622. The [[Mayflower Barn]], just outside the [[Quaker]] village of [[Jordans, Buckinghamshire|Jordans]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, is said to be built from these timbers, but this is likely apocryphal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/History/mflower7.php|publisher=MayflowerHistory.com|accessdate=2008-09-25|title=The Mayflower after the Pilgrims}}</ref>

Details of the ship's dimensions are unknown; but estimates based on its load weight and the typical size of 180-[[Tonnage|ton]] merchant ships of its day suggest an estimated length of 90<U+2013>110 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (27.4<U+2013>33.5 [[Metre|m]]) and a width of about 25 feet (7.6 m).<ref name="Philbrick24">[[#Philbrick|Philbrick]], p. 24</ref>

The ship probably had a crew of twenty-five to thirty,<ref name=MHcrew/> along with other hired personnel; however, only the names of five are known, including [[John Alden (Pilgrim)| John Alden]].<ref name="MHcrew">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/Genealogy/crew.php|title=Crew Genealogy|publisher=Mayflowerhistory.com|accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref>  William Bradford, who penned our only account of the ''Mayflower'' voyage, wrote that John Alden <!-- quote has archaic spellings, please do not correct them --> "''was hired for a cooper'' [barrel-maker], ''at [[Southampton|South-Hampton]], where the ship victuled; and being a hopefull yong man, was much desired, but left to his owne liking to go or stay when he came here; but he stayed, and [[marriage|maryed]] here.''"<ref>{{cite web|quotes=no|title="JOHN ALDEN" (history)|publisher=Pilgrim Hall Museum|date=1998-07-14|url=http://www.pilgrimhall.org/aldenjohn.htm|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

==Pilgrims' voyage==
[[Image:Southampton-MayflowerMemorial.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Mayflower Memorial in [[Southampton]].]]
{{details|Pilgrims|acquisition of the ship and the planning of the voyage}}
Initially, the plan was for the voyage to be made in two vessels, the other being the smaller ''[[Speedwell (ship)|Speedwell]]'', which had transported some of the Pilgrims embarking on the voyage from [[Delfshaven]] in the [[Netherlands]] to [[Southampton]], England.
The first voyage of the ships departed Southampton,<ref name=MayPPM>{{cite book|quotes=no|title="Press Kit - Mayflower II" (with history of the ''Mayflower'')|publisher=Plimouth Plantation Museum|year=2004|url=http://www.plimoth.org/about/presskit/mayflowerBG.asp}}</ref> on August 5/15, 1620, but the ''Speedwell'' developed a leak, and had to be refitted at [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]] on August 17/27.

On the second attempt, the ships reached the [[Atlantic Ocean]] but again were forced to return to [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth]] because of the ''Speedwell'''s leak.  It would later be revealed that there was in fact nothing wrong with the ''Speedwell''. The Pilgrims believed that the crew had, through aspects of refitting the ship, and their behavior in operating it, [[sabotage]]d the voyage in order to escape the year-long commitment of their contract.<ref name="Usher67">[[#Usher|Usher]], p. 67</ref>

After reorganisation, the final sixty-six day voyage was made by the ''Mayflower'' alone, leaving from a site near to the [[Mayflower Steps]] in [[Plymouth, England]] on September 6/16.<ref name=MayPPM/> With 102 passengers plus crew, each family was allotted a very confined amount of space for personal belongings. The Mayflower stopped off at [[Newlyn]] in Cornwall to take on water. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penzance-town-council.org.uk/pzg1/g033.htm|title=Plaque in Newlyn, Cornwall|publisher=www.penzance-town-council.org.uk|accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref>

The intended destination was an area near the [[Hudson River]], in "[[Virginia Company|North Virginia]]". However the ship was forced far off-course by inclement weather and drifted well north of the intended Virginia settlement. As a result of the delay, the settlers did not arrive in Cape Cod until after the onset of a harsh [[New England]] winter. The settlers ultimately failed to reach Virginia where they had already obtained permission from the [[London Company]] to settle, due to difficulties navigating the treacherous waters off the southeast corner of Cape Cod.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cheney|first=Glenn Alan|title=Thanksgiving: The Pilgrims' First Year in America|city=New London|year=2007|publisher=New London Librarium|isbn= 978-0-9798039-0-1}}</ref>

To establish legal order and to quell increasing strife within the ranks, the settlers wrote and signed the [[Mayflower Compact]] after the ship dropped anchor at the tip of Cape Cod on [[November 11]]/[[November 21|21]], in what is now [[Provincetown Harbor]].<ref name=sos/>

The settlers, upon initially setting anchor, explored the snow-covered area and discovered an empty Native American village. The curious settlers dug up some artificially-made mounds, some of which stored corn while others were burial sites. The settlers stole the corn and looted and desecrated the graves,<ref name="Philbrick6162">[[#Philbrick|Philbrick]], pp. 61-62</ref> sparking friction with the locals.<ref name="Mourt's Relation">{{cite book | title=A Relation or Journal of the Beginning and Proceeding of the English Plantation Settled at Plymouth| url=http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/PrimarySources/MourtsRelation.pdf| last=Winslow| first=Edward| coauthors=William Bradford| date=1622| pages=8-10| publisher=John Bellamie| location=[[London, England]]}}
</ref> They moved down the coast to what is now Eastham, and explored the area of Cape Cod for several weeks, looting and stealing native stores as they went.<ref name="Philbrick6570">[[#Philbrick|Philbrick]], pp. 65-70</ref> They decided to relocate to Plymouth after a difficult encounter with the local native Americans, the [[Nauset]]s, at First Encounter Beach, in December 1620.

During the winter the passengers remained on board the ''Mayflower'', suffering an outbreak of a contagious disease described as a mixture of [[scurvy]], [[pneumonia]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=sos/> When it ended, there were only 53 persons still alive, half of the passengers and half of the crew.<ref name=sos/> In spring, they built huts ashore, and on March 21/31, 1621, the surviving passengers left the ''Mayflower''.<ref name=sos/>

On [[April 5]]/[[April 15|15]], 1621, the ''Mayflower'' set sail from [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] to return to England,<ref name=sos/> where she arrived on [[May 6]]/[[May 16|16]], 1621.<ref>"Saga Of The Pilgrims" (historical analysis), John Harris, Globe Newspaper Co., 1983, webpages (no links between): [http://www.unityinchrist.com/history/print/saga1.htm UCcom-saga1] and [http://www.unityinchrist.com/history/print/saga11.htm UCcom-saga11]</ref>

==Passengers==

{{details|The Mayflower Society|descendants of the Mayflower company}}

The ''Mayflower'' left England with 102 passengers and crew.  One baby was born en route, and a second was born during the winter of 1620-1621, when the company wintered aboard ship in Provincetown Harbor.  One child died during the voyage, and there was one stillbirth during the construction of the colony.  Most of the passengers were Pilgrims fleeing persistent religious persecution, but some were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants.

These were the earliest permanent European settlers in [[New England]]. The [[Jamestown settlement]] in what is now [[Virginia]] was the first English settlement in what would become the United States.

==Second Mayflower==
A second ship called the ''Mayflower'' made a voyage from London to Plymouth Colony in 1629 carrying thirty-five passengers, many from the Pilgrim congregation in [[Leiden]] that organized the first voyage. This was not the same ship that made the original voyage with the first settlers. This voyage began in May and reached Plymouth in August.  This ship also made the crossing from England to America in 1630, 1633, 1634, and 1639.  It attempted the trip again in 1641, departing London in October of that year under master John Cole, with 140 passengers bound for Virginia. It never arrived.  On October 18, 1642 a deposition was made in England regarding the loss.<ref>{{cite book|last= Pierson |first=RichardE.|coauthors=Pierson, Jennifer|title= Pierson Millennium||origyear=1997|publisher=Heritage Books, Inc|location= Bowie, Maryland|language=English|isbn=0-7884-0742-2}}</ref>

==Mayflower II==
{{main|Mayflower II}}
After [[World War II]], an effort began to reenact the voyage of the Mayflower.  With cooperation between [[Project Mayflower]] and [[Plimoth Plantation]], an accurate replica of the original (designed by naval architect [[William A. Baker]]) was launched September 22, 1956 from [[Devon]], England, and set sail in the spring of 1957.  Captained by [[Alan Villiers]], the voyage ended in [[Plymouth Harbor]] after 55 days on June 13, 1957 to great acclaim.

==Popular culture==
The ''Mayflower'' voyage and the ship became famous as an icon of a perilous one-way trip to a new life, with many things named for it:
*The ''Mayflower'' is the emblem of the English football club [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]], who are known as "The Pilgrims".
*Songwriter [[Paul Simon]] mentions the ship in his "American Tune" (song).
*[[Yes (band)|Yes]] member [[Jon Anderson]] & [[Vangelis]] (as "[[Jon & Vangelis]]") made a song about the ship called "The Mayflower" released on their album ''[[The Friends of Mr. Cairo]]''.
*Folk/Rock singer [[Bob Dylan]] mentions the ship in his song "Bob Dylan's 115th Dream" on the album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''.
*The space-shuttle parody in the movie ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' is called ''Mayflower One''.
*Mark Carew wrote a book titled 'Flight of the Mayflower' where NASA builds an intergalactic space ship (named the Mayflower) to travel to a new world due to the fact that Earth has become a place where terror, geo-political shift, ecological crisis and nuclear war are pandemic.
*The popular syndicated show [[The Brady Bunch]] had an episode revolving around the Pilgrims and the Mayflower, called, "The Un-Underground Movie" 

==Other European Settlements in North America==

While the Mayflower brought one early settlement, it was not the [[list of North American cities by year of foundation|first settlement in North America]]:
* The Mayflower sailed in 1620, but [[Virginia]] was settled in 1607 at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], 1610 at [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], 1611 at [[Henricus]], 1613 at [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], 1613 at New Bermuda, and several other Virginia settlements which pre-date Plymouth. Virginia even had black [[indentured servant]]s by 1619 and a population of about 4,500 in 1623.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Thomas Jefferson Papers: Virginia Records Timeline 1553-1743|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/jefferson_papers/mtjvatm3.html|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>
* [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], founded in 1541, is the earliest English settlement in the Americas
* [[Albany, New York]] was settled by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in [[1614]]
* The [[Spain|Spanish]] settled [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1565, and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 1610.
* On the island of [[Puerto Rico]], the towns of [[Caparra]] and [[Old San Juan]] would be the first European settlement in the [[United States]], in 1508.<ref>"[[Guaynabo]] -- Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica" (with history of [[Puerto Rico]]), ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'', 2006, ''Britannica.com'' webpage:    [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9038345/Guaynabo EB-Guaynabo-Puerto-Rico]: names: [[Caparra]], the first Spanish settlement of Puerto Rico (1508).</ref>
* Centuries earlier, 500 years before the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Vikings]], from [[Scandinavia]], had [[History of Greenland#Norse Settlement|established permanent settlements]] in [[Greenland]] from 1000 AD until circa 1500.  Those settlements lasted 500 years,{{Fact|date=November 2007}} longer than the entire colonial history of the United States.  In addition, the archeological site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], on the coast near the northern tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in Canada, has also been identified as a 10th or 11th century Viking settlement site.

However, with the ''Mayflower'' voyage in 1620, more emphasis is placed on the so-called "[[Thanksgiving|First Thanksgiving]]" and the peaceful co-existence with the native [[Wampanoag]] tribe, as issues of civilized culture, among the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 original colonies]] of the U.S.
