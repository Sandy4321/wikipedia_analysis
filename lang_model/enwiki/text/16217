'''Pennellville Historic District''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|<U+025B>|n|<U+0268>|l|v|<U+026A>|l}} is an upscale residential district located in the town of [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]], [[Maine]], ([[United States|U.S.A.]]). To residents, it is known simply as "Pennellville".
 

Pennellville is home to historic [[mansions]] built by the Pennell (PEN'-null) family in the 18th and 19th centuries A.D. The neighborhood was home to the Pennellville [[shipyard]], where the Pennell family built wooden [[sailing ships]] for the American shipping trade of the 19th century. Their company was known as "Pennell Brothers," and was one of the most successful shipbuilding companies in all of [[United States|America]]. The shipyard was located in the bay upon which Pennellville sits, known as Middle Bay Cove.

The [[real estate]] in Pennellville is some of the most expensive and desirable in the entire state of [[Maine]]. This is due in large part to the fact that several of the properties are ship captains' mansions. Several properties are waterfront properties, with views of the ocean. 

==History==


===Native Americans===
Before the arrival of white settlers, Pennellville and Brunswick, Maine were inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The greater area was known as "Pejepscot" at the time, and encompassed the modern-day town of Brunswick, and other nearby towns. Native Americans left the area by the year 1725 A.D., 35 years before the Pennell family arrived. Native Americans in the area ate shellfish for survival and discarded the leftover shells. Evidence of their presence can be seen in the arrowheads and piles of empty shells they left behind.

===European Settlers===
Pennellville was settled by Thomas Pennell II in the year 1760. His father, Thomas I, had immigrated from [[Jersey]] (in the [[Channel Islands]]) around 1708. He originally settled in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. Thomas I married Sarah Durin, and sired two sons and two daughters. Thomas I died in 1723. When his two sons, Thomas II (the future settler of Pennellville) and Clement, came of age, both moved north to Falmouth (now known as [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]). They moved around the year 1735 and purchased land in the Stroudwater area. However, Thomas II lost this land in 1759 due to a legal [[encumbrance]]. As a result, he and his family moved to the Brunswick area in 1760. He then built the first house in Pennellville. This original house, however, no longer stands. 

Thomas II had five sons. His second son, Thomas III, was born in 1739. Thomas III lived in the Brunswick area, becoming a [[tax collector]] and was a [[shipwright]] in the 1790s.  He married Alice Anderson of [[Freeport, Maine]]. Together, the couple had five sons and five daughters.  Thomas III taught these sons the shipbuilding trade. Together, they expanded their shipbuilding activities and merchant shipping business in the time period around the year 1800.

The eldest son of Thomas III was Jacob Pennell, born in 1778. He was the most prosperous of the five sons, and built at least 20 ships in Middle Bay (the larger bay upon which Pennellville sits) between 1810 and 1841. He acquired most of the land at Pennellville (land originally owned by his father) by buying the lots that had been divided amongst his brothers. He then built a house with his new-found wealth. As of 2000, his house (the "Jacob Pennell Mansion") is the oldest standing house in Pennellville.

===Shipbuilding===
The earliest records show that Jacob Pennell was building wooden ships around 1760 in the Pennellville shipyard. Over the next 114 years (1760<U+2013>1874), the Pennell family would build in excess of 90 ships in Pennellville. This made them one of the wealthiest and most famous shipbuilding families in all of America. The Pennell family entered into a massive shipbuilding boom, and became one of the families of the fabled American shipbuilding era. 

With the wealth acquired from the massively successful shipbuilding business, more mansions began to follow. Jacob had several sons and, around this time, they christened the company "Pennell Brothers." The area where their activities were centered soon became known as "Pennellville."  

Pennellville was soon considered its own community, and three roads in the area would bear the Pennell name: Pennellville Road, Old Pennellville Road, and Pennell Way. Soon the area had its own schoolhouse and signs designating the area as being separate from Brunswick. Another road in Pennellville, Tedesco Way, is named for a Pennell ship. In all, the Pennells built seven mansions in the area between 1760 and 1877.


===Mansions===
With their new-found fortunes, the Pennell family began building mansions along Pennellville Road. They were built in the style of 19th-century ship captains' homes, which was a popular style of the time period, and very distinctive of [[New England]]. This style was considered very prestigious, and is now an icon of American architecture. The names of the mansions are as follows:

*[[James Pennell Mansion]]
*[[Charles Pennell Mansion]]
*[[Benjamin Pennell Mansion]]
*[[William Pennell Mansion]]
*[[Job Pennell Mansion]]
*[[Jacob Pennell II Mansion]]

One mansion, the James Pennell Mansion, includes a "[[widow's walk]]," a unique architectural feature. A widow's walk is a small tower of sorts on the crown of the roof of an elaborate house. It is a variation of the [[cupola]], and is sometimes referred to as such. According to legend it was used for sea captains, or wives of sailors to observe their husbands' ships returning, oftentimes after their husbands were lost at sea, and thus the name, "widow's walk." The veracity of this legend is disputed, however, and the widow's walk may have simply been an elaborate feature on an upscale house.


=== Historical relevance, relatives and guests===
A notable relative of the Pennell family, Brother of Alice Coffin Pennell, was [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning writer [[Robert P.T. Coffin]] (1892-1955).<ref>Maine League of Historical Societies and Museums (1970). In Doris A. Isaacson. Maine: A Guide 'Down East'. Rockland, Me: Courier-Gazette, Inc. pp. 176<U+2013>177.</ref> Coffin lived in the Jacob Pennell II Mansion, and wrote the critically acclaimed novel ''[[Captain Abby and Captain John]]'' (1939),<ref>http://books.google.com/books/about/Captain_Abby_and_Captain_John.html?id=jUQFAAAAMAAJ</ref> a story about two Pennell ship captains. 

The Pennells gained much visibility during their boom period and entertained famous guests, who often attended ship launchings. A form of 19th-century entertainment, ship launchings were a significant affair. Notables who visited the Pennellville mansions include historic figures such as [[Brigadier General|Gen.]] [[Joshua Chamberlain]] ([[American Civil War|Civil War]] officer, and a hero of [[the Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]); [[Helen Keller]]; and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. After the shipbuilding days, [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Maine Governor|Governor]] [[Angus King]], and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning writer [[James Michener]] all visited the Pennellville mansions. Hellen Keller was a resident of Pennellville, as she lived for a time in the Charles Pennell Mansion.

===Pennell Brothers Shipbuilding Company===
The Pennell Brothers shipbuilding company built wooden ships that carried cargoes around the world in the 18th- and 19th-century cargo trade. Sometimes the family would keep a ship. Under such circumstances, they would retain ownership, and charge clients for shipping cargo. In other instances, the family would simply sell a ship. The ships were sold either in shares or outright to a buyer. The Pennells were also captains of many of the ships they built. 

The business operated out of the shipyard located in Pennellville. The site of the yard, including the "ways" from which a ship was launched, was located in the Pennellville bay (known as Middle Bay Cove). 

The shipyard was moved to three locations in the bay during the operation of the company. The first site was located deep inland, farthest away from the entrance to the ocean. The yard was moved twice after this, getting successively closer to the open ocean with each move. 

It is known with certainty that the Pennell family was building ships in Pennellville by 1760. However, the Pennell family was likely building ships in America before the first records of these activities in the 1760s. This is thought to be true because ancestors who pre-date the first Pennell in America (Thomas I) were shipbuilders in [[England]].


====Routes and cargoes====
Pennell ships carried all sorts of cargoes; among them were [[timber]], deadstock, [[wine]], [[guano]], [[salt]], and [[fruit]]. Often they would also transport people as passengers from port to port for a fee. It is noted, however, that the company was never involved in the American slave trade. 

Ships sailed to ports all over the world, and traded their cargoes. Included in their routes were ports in [[England]], [[Italy]], [[California]], and [[China]], along with many others. A favorite port of the Pennell family was [[Venice, Italy]], which was a cultural center, and prestigious destination. They brought back many paintings of Venice as souvenirs. 

The Pennell family's shipping routes included the infamous run around [[Cape Horn]] at the very tip of [[South America]]. This route was world-famous for being extremely dangerous. Undaunted, the Pennell family sailed it many times.

====Ships====
The ships the Pennells built are generally referred to as "[[Tall Ships]]." They built many different styles of ships that are more specifically classified as [[barque]]s, [[schooners]], [[sloops]], and [[brigs]]. The largest ships weighed over 2,800,000&nbsp;lbs. (1,400 tons), while the smallest weighed as little as 90,000&nbsp;lbs. (45 tons). The Benjamin Sewall, the biggest ship ever built by the Pennells, weighed 2,866,000&nbsp;lbs. (1,433 tons). Completed in 1874, it would also prove to be the last ship the Pennells ever built. In 1903, it sank and was lost off [[Taiwan]] (known at the time as [[Formosa]]).<ref>http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30F10FB3F5D11738DDDA90994D8415B838CF1D3</ref>


====Demise of the shipyard====
Although it is not certain what caused the demise of the yard, there are several factors that likely contributed to its decline. By the end of the 19th century, metal-hulled [[steamships]] had replaced wooden ships as a means of transporting goods around the world. This was combined with the fact that [[railroads]] had also come into their own as a means of shipping. By the end of the 19th century, it was faster and safer to ship cargoes by railroad from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]] than it was to sail around Cape Horn.  

Around this same time, James Pennell (the master builder of the Pennell Brothers company) died as a result of an accident in the shipyard. As James was the last master-builder of the Pennell family, his death was probably a major blow to the workings of the yard. By the early 20th century, the shipyard had gone out of business, although left standing were the stately mansions which the Pennell family had built during their boom period.

===Pennellville today===
Since the boom period of the Pennell Brothers shipbuilding company, Pennellville has retained its prestigious status. The area is considered a very upscale neighborhood. The real estate in Pennellville is some of the most expensive in the area and in the state of Maine, with some of the real estate selling for more than $1,000,000, a considerable sum for the regional market.  

Since the last Pennell mansion was built in 1877, housing development has been relatively sparse, and much of Pennellville remains wooded areas and open fields. However, the area has become somewhat more developed since the 1980s.

Notably, one Pennell family retained ownership of a Pennell mansion until the year 2013. The family was directly descended from the builder, and owned the mansion in an unbroken chain of ownership dating back to the construction of the house in 1837. When this family left Pennellville in 2013, no Pennell families remained in Pennellville.

Because of its historical significance, Pennellville was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985. 

Evidence of the shipyard still exists. The ways (the wooden rails a ship was launched down) can still be seen sitting in the bay at low tide. Another visible feature of the yard is the hall where the shipyard workers lived, located at the very end of Pennellville Road, on the east side of the road.

Artifacts and further information on the Pennell family and the Pennell Brothers shipbuilding company can be found at the following instutions: 
*Maine: [[Bowdoin College]], the [[Pejepscot Historical Society]], the [[Maine Historical Society]], the [[Maine Maritime Museum]], [[Curtis Memorial Library]].
*Massachusetts: The [[Peabody Essex Museum]], the Tedesco Country Club.
*Connecticut: [[Mystic Seaport]]

Most information and artifacts are only available at the physical locations of the institutions listed, and not online.

==Geography and Government==

===Geography===
Pennellville is located in the southern portion of [[Brunswick, Maine]], on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It sits on a cove known as Middle Bay Cove. The greater bay where it sits is known as Middle Bay, which is a part of the still larger [[Casco Bay]].

Although no official boundaries have ever been designated, Pennellville does have a distinct area. The northern boundary of Pennellville is Middle Bay Road; the southern boundary is Middle Bay itself. As Pennellville sits on a [[peninsula]], Middle Bay also forms the eastern boundary, and Simpson's Point Road serves as the western boundary. Properties on Mere Point Road between Middle Bay Road and Simpson's Point Road are not officially considered part of Pennellville, although the Simpson's Point area shares a sense of community with Pennellville. Along with all of the residents of Pennellville, residents of Simpson's Point Road are invited to the yearly neighborhood party, known as the "Pennellville Party." Simpson's Point also shares common family history with Pennellville.

===Local government===
Pennellville is part of the town of Brunswick, Maine, and has no government of its own. Residents use Brunswick's [[post office]], [[police department]], [[fire department|fire]] and rescue departments, [[library]], and [[state school|public school system]]. Residents of Pennellville are also subject to Brunswick's town [[tax|taxation system]], and Maine's state taxation system.
