'''Henry "Buster" Smith''' ([[August 24]], [[1904]]-[[August 10]], [[1991]]), also known as "Professor Smith", was an [[United States|American]] [[Jazz]] [[alto saxophone|alto saxophonist]] and [[mentor]] to [[Charlie Parker]].<ref name=utex>Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. "," http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/fsmgx.html (accessed October 27, 2007)<!-- please don't change this reference as this is the source's preferred means of reference --></ref> Smith was instrumental in instituting the Texas Sax Sound with [[Count Basie]] and [[Lester Young]] in the 1930s. Smith played saxophone for a range of musicians including [[Duke Ellington]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Earl Hines]], though in his career only recorded one solo album in 1959. Despite intending to release a follow-up in the 1960s, Smith was injured in an accident leading to a follow-up never eventuating.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Smith was born and raised in Alsdorf, [[Texas]], a small township near [[Telico, Texas|Telico]] in the outskirts of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], where he attended school as a child. Smith earned the name "Buster" from his parents as a baby, as he was born as an overweight child.<ref name=radioint>{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~afroammu/standifer/smith.html|title=African American Music Collection|publisher=University of Michigan (emich.edu)|date=[[February 23]], [[1974]]|accessdate=2007-10-27|work=Henry "Buster" Smith}}</ref> Buster was the third of five boys and had no sisters, though both of his older brothers died in childhood of measles.<ref name=radioint />

Smith's early musical influences were his mother, a church pianist, and his father, who played guitar. At four years old, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because he believed it would only direct Buster to a life of sin.<ref name=radioint />

===Early career===
In 1919, Smith picked cotton for a week earning himself $350 to buy himself a clarinet. Though prohibited from playing music in the home, Smith learnt to play several instruments by the time he was eighteen years old. In 1922, Smith and his family moved to Dallas where Smith supported the family with his income from playing music and working in a bank. He joined the Voodie White Trio, playing Alto saxophone and clarinet. In 1923, he began his professional music career playing alto saxophone with the [[medicine show]]s, though he had to play very loudly to draw in more customers.<ref name=utex /> This experience led to Smith defining his own musical style, known for being loud. The time with the medicine shows also led to [[Oran Page|Oran "Hot Lips" Page]] inviting Smith to join his group, the [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils]], in 1925. Over the next few years, Smith wrote much of the group's music, learning from banjo player Johnny Clark, writing lyrics with co-workers from the bank that he worked in.<ref name=radioint />

===Peak success===
When Smith joined the Blue Devils, the line-up consisted of [[Walter Page]], Oran Page, [[Lester Young]], [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], and Emir "Bucket" Coleman. They toured the Kansas City area and the Midwest, playing jazz for a year, bringing all of its members into prominence. Basie and Page both left the group, however Smith decided to stay on, though this was very short lived and soon after he left also. After leaving the group, he and Basie formed the ''Buster Smith-Count Basie Band of Rhythm'', where the two innovated a louder style of Jazz. Buster's contribution to the unique sound was by using a tenor saxophone [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] in his alto saxophone to achieve a louder, "fatter" sound.<ref name=utex /> Lester Young also joined the band and, to compliment Smith's louder sound, he also opted for a heavier reed, using a baritone saxophone reed on his tenor saxophone. This sound was later labelled the Texas Sax Sound. Smith gained a great amount of influence in the Texan music community and industry. Smith mentored legendary saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]] during the 1930s, developing a "father-son relationship" through mentoring Parker.<ref name=radioint />

Smith also aided old Dallas friend, [[Charlie Christian]], in his saxophone playing before Christian joined [[Benny Goodman]]'s band. Despite being an [[African American]] and the [[civil rights]] issues of the time, Smith received much respect for his musical contributions. In 1941, Smith decided to return to Dallas and to cease touring, though he remained active in the local music scene. In the following years, he wrote for jazz and blues bands, played often, and taught many young Texan musicians, including [[T-Bone Walker|Aaron "T-Bone" Walker]] and [[Red Garland]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topblogarea.com/sitedetails_8534-3.html|title=Jazz Artists blog|work=Red Garland|publisher=topblogarea.com|date|[[2006-06-01]]|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref> He also performed session work with artists such as [[Pete Johnson]]'s Boogie-Woogie Boys, [[Eddie Durham]], Leo "Snub" Mosley, Bon and His Buddies, and the [[Don Redman Orchestra]].<ref name=radioint />

===Solo career===
In 1959, Buster led his first solo recording session in [[Fort Worth]], as prompted by [[Atlantic Records]]. From these sessions, released by Atlantic with the title ''[[The Legendary Buster Smith]]'', Smith's notable songs included "Kansas City Riffs," Buster's Tune," "E Flat Boogie," and [[Kurt Weill]]'s "[[September Song]]." For the sessions, Buster enlisted his brother Boston Smith to play piano, along with musicians spanning his career to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1285423&cart=619867729&BAB=E|title=Legendary Buster Smith CD|publisher=CD Universe|work=Detailed Information|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref>

===Later life===
In the 1960s, Smith was involved in auto accident, in which he was injured and no longer able to play the saxophone. In order to continue playing music, he started to play the bass guitar throughout Dallas and continued to participate in the Dallas musical community. Buster led a dance music band until 1980. Smith died in Dallas on [[August 10]], [[1991]] of a heart attack.<ref name=utex />
