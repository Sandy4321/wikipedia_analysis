'''Odessa Branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas''' is a [[research institute]] of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine]], which located in [[Odessa]].

== History ==
[[File:Building, Lustdorf Beach 11.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The old building of the Odessa Biological Station in the village of [[Lustdorf]]]]
The institute was established in December 21, 1953 as the '''Odessa Biological Station''' of the [[Institute of hydrobiology of the National Academys of Sciences of Ukraine]] by the resolution of the Councel of Ministers of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. When the Sevastopol Biological Station was reorganised in the [[Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas]] in 1963, the Biological Station in Odessa was also reorganised in Odessa Branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas by the special resolution <U+2116>&nbsp;796 at June 11, 1963. During the long period (1953-1963), the head of the biological station, and then the head of the branch, was [[professor]] [[Konstantin Vinogradov]]. Later, from 1972 to 1989 Professor [[Yuvenali Zaitsev]] was the head of the branch. During 1989-1994 the branch was ruled by [[geographer]], Professor [[Oleksandr Bronfman]], but Yuvenali Zaitsev started to be the most famous researcher of the institute. Since 1994 professor [[Borys Aleksandrov]] is the head of the institute.

== The scientific direction ==
The main scientific direction of the institute is the complex study of the different approaches of [[biology]] and [[ecology]] of marine [[ecosystem]]s. Anomg it:
* The ecology of [[water body]] subjects to the influence of large [[port]]-industrial complexes and communal agglomerations.
* The hydrobiological amelioration and restoration of damaged ecosystems.
* The mathematical modeling of aquatic ecosystems for the purpose of  obtaining unbiased diagnosis and prognosis of their state
* The creation of computer bases of ecological data on the north-western [[Black Sea]] shelf, coastal areas, [[lagoons]] and [[estuaries]] of the [[Danube]]-[[Dniester]] interfluve.
The institute elaborates the modern methods of the sampling and processing of the [[hydrobiology|hydrobiological]] samples, new methods of the analyzing of the scientific information. The institute provides the scientific expertise, 
improves the methods of protection and management of ecosystems and its sustainable development. The Institute provides training of scientific personnel by the post-graduate and post-doc studies on the [[hydrobiology|hydrobiological]] and [[zoology|zoological]] specialisations.
