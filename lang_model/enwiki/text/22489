'''Parisada Hindu Dharma''' was a major reform movement and society <ref>[http://www.suite101.com/lesson.cfm/19490/3026 - Lesson 8: Current Status.] - Suite101</ref> that assisted in the [[Hindu Revival in Indonesia|revival of Hinduism in Indonesia]] . It was started in 1960 by [[Gedong Bagus Oka]].

==Creation==
It lobbied for the rights of Hindusin Bali after [[Hinduism]] became a state sponsored religion (along with [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Catholicism]]) in 1959. From 1960-64 it was known as ''Parisada Hindu Dharma Bali'''. In 1964 however it began to stress a religious rather than regional character and changed its name to ''Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia''<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0279(199507%2F09)115%3A3%3C508%3ATSOTHB%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H The Struggle of the Hindu Balinese Intellectuals: Developments in Modern Hindu Thinking in Independent Indonesia] The American Oriental - Vol. 115, No. 3</ref>

==Religious Efforts==
It sent out many [[Balinese people|Balinese missionairies]] to outlying areas like [[Medan]] <ref>[http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/17/institutes/17EBXC24.html Negotiating Identities - 'Hinduism' in modern Indonesia] - IIAS #17</ref>. In 1992, the Parisada hosted the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] conference in [[Bali]], indicating a building of bridges with the worldwide Hindu community<ref>[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1992/11/1992-11-03.shtml World Hindu Federation Meets in Bali] Hinduism Today - Nov. 1992</ref>. 

==In Politics==
It is the highest religious body in [[Bali]] and is given an official sanction by the [[Government of Indonesia|government]] to look maters of Hindu law. The PHDI in this manner has become a rallying organization for the preservation of [[Hindu]] customs.<ref>[http://www.balix.com/handbook/chapters/religion/religion.html RELIGION] - Balix.org</ref>

The PHD has contested Indoneisa's demographic counts, saying that the 6,501,680 count (given by the government of [[Indonesia]]) grossly undercounts the [[Hindu]] population,<Ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rsd/rsddocview.html?tbl=RSDCOI&id=450fb0aa34 U.S. Department of State Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 2006 - Indonesia - September 2006] US State Department</ref> staing that it is closer to 18 million <ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51512.htm Indonesia International Religious Freedom Report 2005] - US State Department</ref>

==On Law==
The Parisada has lobbied for building restrictions near temples and places of worship in [[Bali]] <ref>[http://www.sustainability.murdoch.edu.au/casestudies/Case_Studies_Asia/bali_2/csmcdon.htm The McDonaldisation of Bali] Institute for Sustainability and Technology Policy - Murdoch University</ref>
