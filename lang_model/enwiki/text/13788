'''Prince Andrew, Duke of York''' (Andrew Albert Christian Edward; born [[19 February]] [[1960]]) is a member of the [[British Royal Family]], the third child and second son of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. He has held the title of [[Duke of York]] since 1986. The Duke of York has been fourth in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession]] since the birth of [[Prince Henry of Wales|Prince Harry]] in 1984.

Andrew, Duke of York married and subsequently divorced [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Sarah Ferguson]]. He also served in the [[Royal Navy]], seeing action in the [[Falklands War]] aboard [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']]. He currently serves as the United Kingdom's [[Special Representative for International Trade and Investment]].

==Early life==

Andrew was born on [[19 February]] [[1960]] in the Belgian Suite of [[Buckingham Palace]], [[London]]. His mother is the reigning [[British monarch]], [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the elder daughter of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]]. His father is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], the only son of [[Prince Andrew of Greece|Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] and [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]]. He was named after his paternal grandfather.

The Prince was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on [[8 April]] [[1960]] by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher|Dr. Geoffrey Fisher]], and his godparents were the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]]; [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]]; [[John Elphinstone, 17th Lord Elphinstone|Lord Elphinstone]]; the [[Hugh FitzRoy, 11th Duke of Grafton|Earl of Euston]] and [[Georgina Phillips|Georgina, Lady Kennard]]. 

He was the first child born to a reigning British monarch since [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] youngest child, [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|The Princess Beatrice]], in 1857. As a child of the reigning monarch, he was styled ''His Royal Highness The Prince Andrew'' from birth.

==Education==
The Prince Andrew received his early education at home, before attending [[Heatherdown Preparatory School]], near [[Ascot, Berkshire]]. In September 1973, he followed his father, The Duke of Edinburgh, and his elder brother, HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], to [[Gordonstoun]], in [[Morayshire]], [[Scotland]]. From January to June 1977, Prince Andrew went on an exchange programme to [[Lakefield College School]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. He left Gordonstoun in July 1979 with [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]]s in English, history and economics, and political science. Unlike his brothers, Prince Andrew did not attend [[university]], choosing to enter the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] instead.

==Military Service==
===Royal Navy===
In November 1978 it was announced that Prince Andrew intended joining the [[Royal Navy]] in the following year. In December he underwent various sporting tests and examinations at the [[RAF Officers' Selection Centre]], RAF [[Biggin Hill]]. Further tests and interviews were conducted at [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)|HMS Daedalus]], [[Lee-on-Solent]], and interviews at the [[Admiralty Interview Board]], [[HMS Sultan]]. In March and April 1979 he was with the Royal Naval College [[Flight]], and underwent pilot grading. He was accepted as a trainee helicopter pilot and signed on for 12 years from [[11 May]] [[1979]].
{{British Royal Family}}
Prince Andrew was appointed a [[Midshipman]] on [[1 September]] [[1979]] and entered Dartmouth on [[12 September]]. He also undertook the [[Royal Marine]] 'Green Beret' [[commando]] course during 1980. 

After passing out of Dartmouth, Prince Andrew went on to elementary flying training with the [[Royal Air Force]] at [[RAF Leeming]], [[Yorkshire]], and later basic flying training with the Royal Navy at [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|Culdrose]], Cornwall, where he learned to fly the [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopter. 

Prince Andrew later converted onto the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter and conducting operational flying training. In 1982, he joined his first front-line unit 820 Naval Air Squadron, serving aboard the [[aircraft carrier]], [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']].

===Falklands War (1982)===
On [[2 April]] [[1982]] the [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] was [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded]] by [[Argentina]], an event that led to the [[Falklands War]]. Prince Andrew's ship, HMS ''Invincible'' was one of two operational aircraft carriers available to the Royal Navy, and as such was to play a major role in [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|the Royal Navy taskforce]] being assembled to sail south to retake the islands.

At first the British government was apprehensive of allowing Prince Andrew to remain on ''Invincible'', and wished to move him to a desk job. The prospect of the son of the Queen being killed in action was a possibility, and the government wished to avoid such a circumstance. However, the Queen insisted that Prince Andrew be allowed to remain with his ship, and so he joined the ''Invincible'' as it sailed south, as a [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter co-pilot.

Throughout the conflict Prince Andrew flew on various missions, including [[ASW|Anti-Submarine Warfare]] (ASW) and [[ASUW|Anti-Surface Warfare]] search (ASuW), [[Exocet missile]] decoy, as well as other missions. He also helped in casualty evacuation, transport and was involved in some highly dangerous Search and Air Rescue (SAR) missions. When the conflict ended, and ''Invincible'' returned to [[Portsmouth]], the Queen and Prince Philip joined other families of the crew to welcome the vessel home.

The Prince remained with HMS ''Invincible'', with brief assignments to the carrier [[HMS Illustrious (R06)|HMS ''Illustrious'']], Culdrose, and the [[Joint Services School of Intelligence]], [[Ashford, Kent]], until 1983.

In Commander [['Sharkey' Ward]]'s book Sea Harrier Over the Falklands, the Prince is described as "an excellent pilot and a very promising officer", by the fighter ace.

Since the war, Prince Andrew has laid a wreath at the Cenotaph each year on Remembrance Sunday to commemorate the South Atlantic campaign.

===Career Naval Officer (1979-2001)===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Andrew Falklands War.jpg|thumb|200px|Prince Andrew in Port Stanley following the [[Falklands War]].]] -->
In late 1983, Prince Andrew transferred to RNAS Portland and learned to fly the [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopter. On promotion to [[Lieutenant]] on [[1 February]] [[1984]], The Queen appointed him a Personal [[Aide-de-camp]]. 

Later service saw the Prince aboard [[HMS Brazen (F91)|HMS ''Brazen'']] as Flight Pilot, 1984-1986 (including deployment to the Mediterranean as part of [[Standing NRF Maritime Group 2|NAVOCFORMED]]).

In 1986, he undertook the [[Lieutenants' Greenwich Staff Course]] at the  [[Royal Naval College]], [[Greenwich]]. On [[23 October]] [[1986]] he transferred to the General List. He then did a four month helicopter warfare instructors' course at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)]], and served from February 1987 to April 1988 as a helicopter warfare officer in [[702 Naval Air Squadron]], [[RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey)]].

He served on [[HMS Edinburgh (D97)|HMS ''Edinburgh'']] as an [[Officer of the Watch]] and Assistant [[Navigating Officer]] 1988-1989, including a six month deployment as part of Exercise ''Outback 88'' to the [[Far East]]. 

Prince Andrew, now the Duke of York, served as flight commander and pilot of the Lynx HAS3 of [[HMS Campbeltown|HMS ''Campbeltown'']] 1989 to 1991. During this assignment he served as Force Aviation Officer to [[Standing NRF Maritime Group 1|STANAVFORLANT]] when HMS ''Campbeltown'' was flagship of the NATO force in the North Atlantic 1990-1991. 

Prince Andrew passed the squadron command examination on [[16 July]] [[1991]]. In 1992, he attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]] and completed the army staff course.

He became a [[Lieutenant-Commander]] on [[1 February]] [[1992]], and passed the ship command examination on [[12 March]] [[1992]]. Between 1993 and 1994, he commanded the Hunt Class Minehunter [[HMS Cottesmore (M32)|HMS ''Cottesmore'']], based at [[Portsmouth]]. Curiously, one of the officers of the ship was [[Sub-Lieutenant]] JW Gold, a Special Duties (commissioned from the ranks) electronic warfare officer. It is not clear whether this had any specific implications, however such highly specialised officers are usually deployed to major warships which contain a strategic intelligence suite, and his presence on a mine countermeasures vessel was unusual.

In 1995 and 1996, the Duke of York was Senior Pilot of [[815 Naval Air Squadron]], a unit with over 80 aircrew, 420 ground staff and 41 helicopters - the largest flying unit in the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. The main role of the Senior Pilot was to supervise flying standards to guarantee an effective operational capability. 

Prince Andrew was made a [[Commander#Royal_Navy|Commander]] on [[27 April]] [[1999]]. He finished his naval career at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in [[London]] 1999 to 2001 as an officer of the Diplomatic Directorate of the [[Naval Staff]].

He was released from the Active List of the [[Royal Navy]] in July 2001. In July 2005, he was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]], Royal Navy. Unusually, although a former career officer, His Royal Highness was made an Honorary Captain, rather than given the substantive rank of Captain, as was traditional and might have been expected.

===Canadian military===
Andrew is the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of a number of [[Canadian Forces]] regiments, travelling to Canada to frequently undertake duties related to these roles.  Rick Peters, commanding officer of [[the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada]] stated: "[Andrew]'s very well informed on Canadian military methods."<ref>[http://www.cambridgetimes.ca/cam/news/news_777717.html Hurst, Jeff; ''Cambridge Times'': Princely plans for Andrew; May 1, 2007]</ref>

==Marriage==
On [[23 July]] [[1986]], Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson (now [[Sarah, Duchess of York]]), the second daughter of the late Major [[Ronald Ferguson]] and his former wife, the late Susan (Mrs. Hector) Barrantes, at [[Westminster Abbey]]. On the day of his wedding, the Queen created him [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killyleagh]] - titles previously held by both his maternal great-grandfather and grandfather, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]. Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were born only a few months apart. They had known each other since childhood and would meet occasionally at polo matches, a sport in which both families took a keen interest. They became re-acquainted with one another during the Ascot racing season of 1985.

Together the Duke and Duchess of York have two children:

* [[Princess Beatrice of York]] (born [[8 August]] [[1988]]) 
* [[Princess Eugenie of York]] (born [[23 March]] [[1990]]).

==Divorce==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2006}}
The Duke and Duchess of York appeared to have a happy marriage and presented a united front during the late 1980s. The Duchess was seen as a breath of fresh air in the context of the stuffy royal protocol surrounding the Royal Family. However, underneath there were problems in the marriage, largely involving the fact that the Duke of York was frequently away on Navy business and the relentless, often critical, media attention focussed on the Duchess.

On [[19 March]] [[1992]], the Duke and Duchess announced their plans to separate. It was an amicable parting, and the decision was made by the Duke and Duchess alone. Some months after their separation in 1992, pictures of the Duchess appeared in the British tabloid press, showing her in compromising positions with her financial advisor, the American [[John Bryan (financial advisor)|John Bryan]]. This effectively ended any hopes of a reconciliation and did nothing to diminish the extent to which the Duchess was being targeted by the tabloid media.

The Duke and Duchess of York divorced on [[30 May]] [[1996]].<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p10071.htm#i100707 www.thepeerage.com]</ref> Their divorce was friendly, and it was stipulated that custody of the two princesses would be shared between them. The Duchess of York was no longer [[Royal Highness|''Her Royal Highness'']], but instead became styled, as the [[Courtesy title#Divorced wives|ex-wife of a peer]], as [[Sarah, Duchess of York]]. The close, now-platonic, friendship between the Duke and Duchess has continued, and the Duchess lived on and off in the Duke's home at [[Sunninghill Park]] until 2004 when the Duke moved to [[Royal Lodge]], the former home of the Queen Mother. In 2007 the Duchess purchased Dolphin House, a mansion which lies directly beside Royal Lodge, effectively rendering the Duke and Duchess of York as next door neighbours.It is said, and speculated, by many that she bought this house so she could be closer to her daughters, who reside with the Duke.

The prince speaks warmly of his ex-wife. "We have managed to work together to bring our children up in a way that few others have been able to do and I am extremely grateful to be able to do that."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/04/america/andrew.php "From Prince Andrew, critical words for the U.S. on Iraq], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', [[2008-02-04]]. Retrieved on [[2008-02-04]].</ref>

==Current role==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2006}}
[[Image:Duke of York - World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2008.jpg|thumb|The Duke of York in his role as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment at the [[World Economic Forum]] on the Middle East 2008.]]
Currently the Duke of York works for the [[Department of Trade and Industry]] as the [[United Kingdom]]'s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment. He took over from [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] in this role. The role involves the Duke representing the UK at various trade fairs and conferences all over the world.

The Duke is also a keen [[golf]]er, and plays to a low single-figure handicap standard. <ref>''Royal'', by Robert Lacey, 2002.</ref> He is Captain of the [[Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews]], and also a member of [[the Royal Burgess Golfing Society]]. This is not without controversy, and the Duke has been criticised for using the [[Queen's Flight]] for transport to various golfing functions.

Since 2004, Prince Andrew has lived at [[Royal Lodge]], [[Windsor Great Park]], the former country home of his grandmother, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]]. Prior to that he lived at [[Sunninghill Park]].  The Duke of York maintains an office at [[Buckingham Palace]].

For the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in May 2007, the Duke served as [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]. The role granted him, in Scotland, whilst the assembly was in session, precedence immediately after his parents, and the style [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland#Form of address|''His Grace'' '''The Lord High Commissioner''']].

:'''1st''' and '''4th''', Gules three Lions passant guardant in pale Or (England). (The first and fourth quarters display the three lions, representing England.) 
:'''2nd''' quarter is of a lion rampant within a Double Tressure floury counterflory Gules (Scotland). (The second quarter, displays a red lion in a yellow field with a double border coloured red, this represents Scotland.)
:''' 3rd''', Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent (Ireland). (The third quarter shows a harp against a blue background, this represents Ireland.)

The whole differenced by a Label of three points Argent the central point charged with an ''Anchor Azure''. The anchor is in reference to his naval career.

The arms are identical to those his grandfather [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] used when still Duke of York.
