'''Lake Tear of the Clouds''' ({{coord|44.1069|N|73.9359|W|type:waterbody_region:US-NY}}) is a small [[tarn (lake)|tarn]] located in the town of [[Keene, New York|Keene]], in [[Essex County, New York]], on the southwest slope of [[Mount Marcy (New York)|Mount Marcy]]; it is both the highest lake in the state and the highest source of the [[Hudson River]] via Feldspar Brook and the Opalescent River. The Hudson River officially begins several miles southwest of Marcy at [[Henderson Lake]] (1,814 ft).

The lake was discovered in 1872, by [[Verplanck Colvin]] while he was surveying the [[Adirondacks]]. He wrote:

{{cquote|Far above the chilly waters of Lake Avalanche at an elevation of 4,293 feet lies summit water, a minute, unpretending, tear of the clouds &mdash; as it were &mdash; a lovely pool shivering in the breezes of the mountains and sending its limpid surplus through Feldspar Brook to the Opalescent River, the well-spring of the Hudson.''}}

On September 14, 1901, then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was at Lake Tear of the Clouds after returning from a hike to the Marcy summit when he received a message informing him that [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]], who had been [[William McKinley assassination|shot two weeks earlier]] but expected to survive, had taken a turn for the worse.

Roosevelt hiked down 10 miles (16 km) on the southwest side of the mountain to the closest stage station at [[Newcomb, New York]].  He then took a midnight [[stagecoach]] ride on twisting roads to the [[Adirondack Railway]] station at [[North Creek, New York]] where he learned that McKinley had died. Roosevelt took the train to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] where he was officially sworn in as President.

The 40-mile (64 km) route is now designated the [[Roosevelt-Marcy Trail]].
