The '''Racking Horse''' is [[horse]] breed derived from the [[Tennessee Walking Horse]], recognized by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] in 1978.  It is known for a distinctive [[ambling|singlefoot]] gait. In 1971, the Racking Horse Breeders' Association of  America, headquartered in [[Decatur, Alabama]], was formed as the [[breed registry]].  Its goal is to preserve the breed in a natural state with little or no artificial devices that enhance [[horse gait|gait]]. The horse's tail is naturally raised without nicking. Some classes allow special shoes that enhance action and a new class allows the use of chains, 6 ounces and under as action devices. The practice of [[Tennessee Walking Horse|soring]], illegal under the [[Horse Protection Act of 1970]], is also seen within the Racking horse world. 

==Characteristics==

The Racking Horse is a light [[riding horse]], standing an average of {{hands|15.2}} high and weighing around {{convert|1000|lbs|kg}}. Overall, the Racking Horse is described as "attractive and gracefully built".<ref name=AL/> The neck is long, the shoulders and [[rump (animal)|croup]] sloping and the build overall well-muscled. Colors accepted by the breed registry include all solid [[equine coat color]]s, including those created by [[dilution gene]]s, such as [[cream gene|cream]] and [[champagne gene|champagne]].<ref name=Dutson/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rackinghorse.com/forms/rulebook.pdf|page=21|format=PDF|title=Section 5.2: Conformation|work=Bylaws of the Racking Horse Breeders Association of America|publisher=Racking Horse Breeders Association of America|accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> The breed is known for its [[ambling]] gait, a four-beat intermediate-speed gait known as the rack or single-foot, which it performs in addition to the [[walk (horse gait)|walk]] and [[canter]].<ref name=AL>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/emblems/st_horse.html|title=Official State Horse: Racking Horse|publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History|accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> The latter gait is not performed at breed-specific [[horse show]]s. When assessing the rack, judges place greater weight on correct movement and speed, rather than extreme elevation.<ref name=Dutson/>

==History==  

The ancestors of the Racking horse were bred on southern plantations prior to the [[American Civil War]]. They could be ridden comfortably for hours because of their smooth, natural gait. They were also bred for a good disposition, intelligence, and versatility.<ref name=Dutson>{{cite book|title=Storey's Illustrated Guide to 96 Horse Breeds of North America|author=Dutson, Judith|publisher=Storey Publishing|year=2005|isbn=1580176135|pages=212-213}}</ref> Their development was similar to that of the more famous [[Tennessee Walking Horse]], also popular in the southeastern US.<ref name=Harris>{{cite book| author = Harris, Moira C. and Langrish, Bob| coauthors = Bob Langrish, Moira C.

Racking horses were most commonly seen at small shows, although they were also seen at larger ones. They did not have their own breed association, however,<ref name=Dutson/> and were often shown as a type of Tennessee Walking Horse.<ref name=Harris/>

In the mid 1900s, Racking horse enthusiasts formed their own group, the Racking Horse Breeders Association of America, and their breed was recognized by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] as separate from the Tennessee Walking Horse in 1971.<ref name=Dutson/> In 1975, the Racking Horse was designated the official state horse of Alabama.<ref name=AL/>

===Showing===

The Racking Horse Breeders Association of America was originally formed as a vehicle for the promotion of horses shown without the artificial and extreme devices often seen in Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breed showing.<ref name=Dutson/> However, the Racking Horse is one of the breeds often harmed by the inhumane practice of [[soring]], prohibited at the federal level by the [[Horse Protection Act of 1970]]. Soring is a practice used to accentuate the gaits of breeds such as the Tennessee Walking Horse and Racking Horse, in order to gain an unfair advantage in competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_welfare/content/printable_version/faq_rev_horsep.pdf|title=The Horse Protection Act|format=PDF|publisher=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|date=September 2009|accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref>
