Degnan was selected by [[New Jersey Governor]] [[Brendan Byrne]] as assistant counsel in November 1974. He later served as Governor Byrne's executive secretary from March 1976 to March 1977, when he became special counsel to the Governor. After Byrne was elected to a second term, he announced Degnan's appointment as Attorney General. His nomination was confirmed in January 1978, and at 33 he was among the youngest ever to serve as Attorney General.<ref name=Bio/>

In 1981, Degnan resigned his position as Attorney General to run in the Democratic primary for Governor. The crowded field of 13 Democratic candidates included U.S. Representative [[James Florio]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] Mayor [[Kenneth A. Gibson]], [[New Jersey Senate]] President [[Joseph P. Merlino]], U.S. Representative [[Robert A. Roe]], and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] Mayor [[Thomas F. X. Smith]].

But in the primary election Degnan received only 11 percent of the vote, finishing in fifth place behind Florio (26 percent), Roe (16 percent), Gibson (16 percent), and Merlino (11 percent).<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20815FD395C0C778CDDAF0894D9484D81 "Florio and Kean Agree Taxes Are Key Issue"].
