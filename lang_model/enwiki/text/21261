'''''The Green Mile''''' is a 1996 [[Serial (literature)|serial novel]] written by [[Stephen King]]. Published in six volumes, it was crafted while the book was already in production.{{fact}} It focuses on the encounter a death row supervisor, Paul Edgecombe, has with an unusual inmate, John Coffey, who displays unexplainable healing and empathetic abilities. The novel was originally published in serial form before being republished as a single volume work.

==Plot==
<!-- note: plot summary needs to be checked for accuracy...seems like someone mostly just changed the movie summary which is different -->
A [[first-person narrative]] told by Paul Edgecombe, the novel switches between Paul as an old man in a [[nursing home]] sharing his story with fellow resident Elaine Connelly, and his time in 1932 as the block supervisor of the Cold Mountain Penitentiary death row, nicknamed "The Green Mile". In this year, a new inmate arrives named John Coffey, a 6'8" [[African American|black]] man who has been convicted of [[Rape|raping]] and [[murder]]ing two small white girls. Besides Coffey, there are two other prisoners on the cellblock during the main period the book focuses on: Eduard "Del" Delacroix, a [[Cajun]] [[arson]]ist and murderer, William "Wild Bill" Wharton, a wild-acting and dangerous multiple murderer who is determined to make as much trouble as he can before he is executed, Arlen Bitterbuck, a [[Native America]]n convicted of killing his wife, Arthur Flanders, an [[insurance]] executive who killed his father to perpetrate [[insurance fraud]], and Mr. Jingles, a mouse, who Del teaches various tricks.

Paul and the other guards are antagonized throughout the book by Percy Wetmore, a sadistic guard who enjoys aggravating the prisoners. The other guards have to be civil to him despite their dislike of him because he is the Governor's nephew. However, when he is offered a place at the nearby Briar Ridge [[psychiatric hospital]] as a [[secretary]], Paul thinks they are finally rid of him. However, Percy refuses to leave until he is allowed to supervise an execution, so Paul hesitantly allows him to run Delacroix's. Percy deliberately avoids soaking the sponge in brine that is supposed to tucked inside the [[electrode]] cap to ensure a faster death. When the switch is thrown, the [[electric current]] causes Del to suffer an agonizing death and literally fry in the chair.

Over time, Paul realizes that John Coffey possesses [[Psychic|inexplicable healing]] abilities. These powers heal Paul's [[urinary tract infection]] and revives Mr. Jingles after Percy a kills him by stepping on him. Coffey is very [[Empathy|empathic]] and sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others around him. One night, the guards drug William Wharton, then put a [[straitjacket]] on Percy and lock him in the padded [[Solitary confinement|restraint room]] so that they can smuggle John out of the prison and take him to the home of Warden Hal Moore. Moore's wife has a deadly [[brain tumor]], which Coffey cures. When they return to the Mile, John passes the "disease" which he took out of the warden's wife onto Percy, causing him to go mad and shoot Wharton to death before falling into a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state from which he never recovers. Percy is committed to Briar Ridge. 

Coffey shows Paul that it was Wharton who committed the murders, not himself. Paul is unsure how to help John, but John tells him not to worry, as he is ready to die anyway, wanting to escape the cruelty of the world. Those healed by John gain an unnatural lifespan. In the end, Mr. Jingles lives to be at least 64 and dies of old age at Paul's nursing home, while Paul is now 104 years old and wondering how much longer he will live.
