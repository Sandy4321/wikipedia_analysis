A '''Christmas calendar''' ({{lang-sv|julkalender}}, {{lang-da|julekalender}} {{lang-fi|joulukalenteri}}, {{lang-no|julekalender}}, {{lang-is|j<U+00F3>ladagatal}}) is a form of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] televised [[advent calendar]]s, first introduced in [[Sweden]] in 1960.

Each series consists of 24 episodes which air daily beginning on the first of December, and ending on [[Christmas Eve]]. The first ''Christmas calendar'' was the Swedish ''[[Titteliture]]''.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071210121106/http://www.sr.se/barn/jul50/bakgrund.stm Julkalendern 50 <U+00E5>r - Bakgrund<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The first such series aired in Denmark was [[Historier fra hele verden]] in 1962. The form gradually extended into the other Nordic countries of [[Norway]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]].

Most ''Christmas calendars'' are produced for children, while some cater to both children and adults, and even some are directed at adults alone. Many ''Christmas calendar'' series, such as the 1979 Norwegian [[Jul i Skomakergata]], and the Icelandic [[<U+00C1> ba<U+00F0>kari til Betlehem]] have become classics in their respective countries, and are enjoyed both by children and adults (if purely for nostalgic reasons).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A more modern version of a ''Christmas calendar'' is the show ''[[The 24th]]'', which is a parody on the popular [[United States|American]] series ''[[24 (television)|24]]'' starring [[Kiefer Sutherland]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
