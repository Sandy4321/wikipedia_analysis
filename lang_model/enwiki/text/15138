The '''Falkirk Wheel''' is a rotating [[boat lift]] located in Scotland, UK,
connecting the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] with the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]], opened in 2002.  It is named after the nearby town of [[Falkirk]] which is in central Scotland. The two canals were previously connected by a series of 11 [[canal lock|locks]], but by the 1930s these had fallen into disuse, were filled in and the land built upon.

The plan to regenerate the canals of [[Central Belt|central Scotland]] to reconnect [[Glasgow]] with [[Edinburgh]] was led by [[British Waterways]] with support and funding from seven local authorities, the [[Scottish Enterprise]] Network, the European Regional Development Fund and the [[Millennium Commission]].  It was decided early on to create a dramatic 21st century landmark structure to reconnect the canals, instead of simply recreating the historic lock flight.  Designs were submitted for a boat lift to link the canals, with the Falkirk Wheel design winning.  As with many Millennium Commission projects the site includes a visitors' centre containing a shop, caf<U+00E9> and [[Convention center|exhibition centre]].

The difference in the levels of the two canals at the wheel is {{convert|24|m}}, roughly equivalent to the height of an eight-[[storey]]<!-- British spelling; please do not change to 'story' --> building. The Union Canal, however, is 11m higher than the aqueduct which meets the wheel, and boats must pass through a pair of locks to descend from this canal onto the aqueduct at the top of the wheel. The aqueduct could not have been positioned higher due to conflicts with
the historically important [[Antonine Wall]].

The structure is located near the [[Rough Castle Fort]] and the closest village is [[Tamfourhill]].
On 24 May 2002, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the Falkirk Wheel as part of her [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] celebrations. The opening had been delayed by a month due to flooding caused by vandals who forced open the Wheel's gates.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=541&id=1138932002 Wheel back on roll after vandalism repair work] news.scotsman.com, 14 October 2002.

Architectural services were supplied by Scotland-based [[RMJM]], from initial designs by [[Nicoll Russell Studios, Architects|Nicoll Russell Studios]] and engineers Binnie Black and Veatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evolution.skf.com/zino.aspx?articleID=391&lan=en-gb |title=Initial designs were by Nicoll Russell Studios |publisher=Evolution.skf.com |date=2002-02-16 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> The main project architect was an RMJM architect named Tony Kettle.

Bachy/Soletanche and Morrison Construction Joint Venture won the contract to design the wheel and receiving basin, a new section of canal, a tunnel beneath the Antonine wall and a section of aqueduct. In turn the Joint Venture appointed [[Butterley Engineering]] to design and construct the wheel. Butterley undertook all construction work for the wheel and set up its own team to carry out the design work. This team comprised Tony Gee and Partners, to undertake the structural design responsibilities and M G Bennett & Associates to design the mechanical and electrical equipment for the wheel.

The wheel has an overall diameter of {{convert|35|m}} and consists of two opposing arms which extend 15 metres beyond the central axle and take the shape of a Celtic-inspired, [[Labrys|double-headed axe]]. Two sets of these axe-shaped arms are attached about {{convert|25|m}} apart to a {{convert|3.5|m}} diameter axle. Two [[Antipodal point|diametrically opposed]] water-filled [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]], each with a capacity of {{convert|80000|impgal}}, are fitted between the ends of the arms.

These caissons always weigh the same whether or not they are carrying their combined capacity of {{convert|600|t}} of floating canal barges as, according to [[Buoyancy#Archimedes.27 principle|Archimedes' principle]], floating objects displace their own weight in water, so when the boat enters, the amount of water leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat. This keeps the wheel balanced and so, despite its enormous mass, it rotates through 180<U+00B0> in five and a half minutes while using very little power. It takes just {{convert|22.5|kW}} to power the [[electric motor]]s, which consume just {{convert|1.5|kWh}} of energy in four minutes, roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water.

The wheel is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world, and is regarded as an engineering landmark for Scotland. The United Kingdom has one other boat lift: the [[Anderton boat lift]] in [[Cheshire]]. The Falkirk Wheel is an improvement on the Anderton boat lift and makes use of the same original principle: two balanced tanks, one going up and the other going down, however, the rotational mechanism is entirely unique to the Falkirk Wheel.

Since 2007 the Falkirk Wheel has featured on the obverse of the new series of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|<U+00A3>50 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of Scotland]]. The series of notes commemorates Scottish engineering achievements with illustrations of bridges in Scotland such as the [[Glenfinnan Viaduct]] and the [[Forth Bridge (rail)|Forth Rail Bridge]].<ref name="scotbanks">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_bank_of_scotland.php|title=Current Banknotes : Bank of Scotland|publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>

==Construction==
The wheel was constructed by [[Butterley Engineering]] at [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] in [[Derbyshire]] under [[Millennium Plan]]s to reconnect the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal, mainly for recreational use.

==Operation==
[[Image:cog mechanism falkirk.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Showing the ring gears]]

The wheel rotates together with the axle, which is supported by four-metre-diameter [[slewing bearing]]s that are fitted to the ends of the axle and have their outer rings mounted on the [[plinth]]s, which in turn are constructed on top of [[deep foundations|piled foundations]].

The slewing bearing at the machine-room end of the axle has an [[Epicyclic gearing|inner ring gear]] which is configured to act as a rotating [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]]. The rotating annulus is driven by ten hydraulic motors which are assembled on a stationary bearing and motor assembly known as the ''planet carrier'' which in turn is also mounted onto a plinth similar to the one at the other end of the axle. The drive-shafts of the motors have pinion gears which act as stationary [[Sun_and_planet_gear|planetary gears]] in this train of gears and engage the rotating annulus [[Starter ring gear|ring gear]]. An electric motor drives a hydraulic pump which is connected to the hydraulic motors by means of hoses and drive the wheel at 1/8 revolution per minute.

===How the caissons are kept level===

The caissons need to rotate at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction to keep them level and to ensure that the load of boats and water does not tip out when the wheel turns.

Each end of each caisson is supported on small wheels which run on the inside face of the eight-metre-diameter holes at the ends of the arms, allowing the caissons to rotate.  The rotation is controlled by means of a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three eight-metre-diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth.  The central large gear acts as a stationary ''sun gear''.  It is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed to a plinth to prevent it from rotating.  The two, smaller, idler gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end and act as ''planet gears''.  When the motors rotate the wheel, the arms swing and the planet gears engage the sun gear, which results in the planet gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction.  The planet gears engage the large ring gears at the end of the caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction.  This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.

===Docking-pit===
[[Image:Falkirk wheel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Falkirk Wheel in action. The wedge-shaped building on the right is the visitors' centre. Note the Docking Pit at the bottom canal.]]
The docking-pit is a [[drydock|drydock-like port]] which is isolated from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps. When the wheel rotates and stops with its arms in the vertical position it is possible for boats to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking-pit. The space below the caisson is empty.

If it were not for inclusion of the docking-pit the caissons and extremities of the arms of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotates. This would result in a number of undesirable situations developing, such as providing [[buoyancy]] to the bottom caisson and the [[viscosity]] of the water causing an increase in the required power.

===How the canal was routed through the wheel===
The route chosen to take the Union Canal to the site of the wheel involved building a completely new section of canal, leading from the original terminus at Port Maxwell to link up with a new basin to the south of the wheel.

The water level in this basin is the same as the [[aqueduct]] at the top section of the wheel, the two being joined by the new 150 metre long Rough Castle Tunnel with [[elliptical]] cross section. This is the most recent new canal tunnel to be built in the UK since canal excavation in [[Dudley]], West Midlands.

There are two locks to drop the canal level from that of the Union Canal to this basin. The tunnel was required because the canal had to pass underneath the route of the [[Antonine Wall]] without disturbing its archaeological remains.  Just at this point the tunnel also passes below a road and the main Edinburgh to Glasgow [[Rail tracks|railway line]].

==Costs and prices==

The Falkirk Wheel cost <U+00A3>17.5 million, and the restoration project as a whole cost <U+00A3>84.5 million<ref>[http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/about/history.html About The Falkirk Wheel] www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk, Retrieved. Retrieved 8 July 2006.</ref> (of which <U+00A3>32 million came from [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funds).

The Falkirk Wheel [[Visitor center|Visitor Centre]] offers scheduled one-hour, [[:wikt:round trip|round trip]] boat tours, called "The Falkirk Wheel Experience", that include passage on the wheel.  The tours start below the wheel in the Forth & Clyde Canal, ascend via the wheel to the Union Canal, visit nearby areas on the Union Canal, and then return.  {{As of|2010}}, the boat tour costs <U+00A3>7.95 for adults, <U+00A3>4.95 for children aged 3<U+2013>15 (free for children under 3), [[OAP]] concession <U+00A3>6.95, student/state benefits concession <U+00A3>6.95, and family price of <U+00A3>23.24 (2 adults and 2 or more children -10% discount) with a discount of 10% for a group of 20 or more.<ref>[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/falkirk/falkirkwheel/index.html The Falkirk Wheel - Undiscovered Scotland: The Ultimate Online Guide] www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk.

==Future rotating boat lifts==
A similar design of boat lift has been suggested for a proposed new canal that would run along [[Forest of Marston Vale|Marston Vale]] in [[Bedfordshire]]. It would be part of a [[Megaproject|large-scale project]] creating an area of leisure and tourism facilities linked to the future expansion of [[Bedford]] and [[Milton Keynes]]. The lift would link the [[Grand Union Canal]] at Milton Keynes with the [[River Great Ouse]] at Bedford.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,904484,00.html First British canal for 100 years announced] www.guardian.co.uk, 28 February 2003. Retrieved 8 July 2006.</ref>

A future expansion of the Forth & Clyde canal at the entrance to the River Forth has been proposed. It would use two new boat lift structures, with horses' heads around {{convert|115|ft|m}} tall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://falkirkhelix.co.uk/news/latest/glasgow-artist-to-create-worlds-largest-horse-sculptures.html |title=Search - Falkirk Helix |publisher=Falkirk Helix<! |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>  Models of the [[Kelpie]] (mythological horse) heads planned for use in this new boat lift can be seen at the basin of the Falkirk Wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&vxChannel=Visit%20Places&vxClipId=1380_SMG888&vxBitrate=300 |title=Falkirk Wheel Film |publisher=Scotlandontv.tv |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>
