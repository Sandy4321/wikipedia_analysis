[[File:Nervous Witch 20.png|350px|thumb|A page from ''"The Nervous Witch"'', a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] [[Chick tract|written by]] [[christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Jack Chick]], depicting the purportedly occult dangers of the ''Harry Potter'' series.]]
'''Religious debates over the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series''' of books by [[J. K. Rowling]] stem largely from assertions that the novels contain [[occult]] or [[Satanism|Satanic]] subtexts. A number of [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christianity|Christians]] have argued against the series, as have some  [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims.

Responses to these claims have come from many corners. Supporters of the series have asserted that the magic in ''Harry Potter'' bears little resemblance to occultism, being more in the vein of [[fairy tale]]s such as ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', or to the works of [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], both authors known for writing fantasy novels with heavily Christian subtexts.<ref name=Olsen>{{cite web|title=Opinion Roundup: Positive About Potter|author=Ted Olsen|url=http://www.cesnur.org/recens/potter_010.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue,<ref name=Olsen /> the ''Harry Potter'' novels go out of their way to avoid discussing religion at all.<ref name=nogod>{{cite web|title=J.

K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian,<ref name=Baltimore /> and many have noted the overtly Christian references she includes in the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.<ref name=bowyer />

In the United States, calls for the books to be banned from schools have occasionally led to widely publicised legal challenges, often on the grounds that [[witchcraft]] is a government-recognised religion and that to allow the books to be held in public schools violates the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].<ref name=timeline/><ref name=mallory1/><ref name=mallory2/> The Orthodox churches of [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]] have also campaigned against the series,<ref name=bulgaria>{{cite web|title=Bulgarian church warns against the spell of Harry Potter|author=Clive Leviev-Sawyer|work=Ecumenica News International|url=http://www.eni.ch/articles/display.shtml?04-0394|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref><ref name=thrace>{{cite web|title=Church: Harry Potter film a font of evil|work=Kathimerini|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100021_14/01/2003_25190|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-15}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and some Catholic writers and officials have voiced a critical stance.<ref name="Pope Opposes Harry Potter Novels" /> The books have been banned from private schools in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and criticised in the [[Iran]]ian state-run press.<ref name=UAE>{{cite news|title=Emirates ban Potter book|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1816012.stm|accessdate=2007-07-10 | date=2002-02-12}}</ref><ref name=Iran>{{cite web|title=Iranian Daily: Harry Potter, Billion-Dollar Zionist Project|work=The Mimri blog|url=http://www.thememriblog.org/blog_personal/en/2269.htm|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>

Religious responses to ''Harry Potter'' have not been exclusively negative. "At least as much as they've been attacked from a theological point of view," notes Rowling, "[the books] have been lauded and taken into pulpit, and most interesting and satisfying for me, it's been by several different faiths."<ref name=womanyear>{{cite news|title=Time Person of the Year Runner Up: JK Rowling|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html|accessdate=2007-12-23 | date=2007-12-19}}</ref>

== Christianity ==
=== Evangelicalism ===
Much of the criticism of ''Harry Potter'' is from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe the series' alleged [[paganism|pagan]] imagery is dangerous to their children. Paul Hetrick, spokesman for [[Focus on the Family]], an American Evangelical Christian group based in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], outlined the reasons for his opposition to them: "[They contain] some powerful and valuable lessons about love and courage and the ultimate victory of good over evil; however, the positive messages are packaged in a medium <U+2013> witchcraft <U+2013> that is directly denounced in [[Bible|Scripture]]."<ref name="Harry Potter expelled from school">{{cite news|url=http://www.cesnur.org/recens/potter_06.htm|publisher=Denver Rocky Mountain News|title=Harry Potter expelled from school|date=1999-11-06|last=Kurtz|first=Holly}}</ref> Accordingly, ''Harry Potter'' has been the subject of at least three local [[book burning]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1735623.stm|publisher=BBC|title='Satanic' Harry Potter books burnt|date=2001-12-31|accessdate=2007-03-13}}; {{cite news|title=Harry Potter meets Wizard of Dumb|author= Michael Miller|work=South Florida Business Journal |url=http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2001/04/23/editorial2.html|accessdate=2007-07-05|date=2001-04-23}}; Audi, Tamara (Aug. 6, 2003).

''[[Detroit Free Press]]''</ref> Continuing with the same line of reasoning, in 2002, [[Chick Publications Inc.|Chick Publications]] produced a comic book tract titled "The Nervous Witch" that declared "the Potter books open a doorway that will put untold millions of kids into hell."<ref name="The Nervous Witch">{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5012/5012_01.asp|publisher=Chick Publications|title=The Nervous Witch|accessdate=2007-03-13|last=Chick|first=Jack T.}}</ref> In 2007 Jacqui Komschlies wrote an article in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' comparing ''Harry Potter'' to "[[rodenticide|rat poison]] mixed with [[Orange soft drink|orange soda]]," and said, "We're taking something deadly from our world and turning it into what some are calling 'merely a literary device.{{' "}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Matters of Opinion: The Perils of Harry Potter|author=Jacqui Komschlies|work=Christianity Today|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2000/october23/34.113.html|year=2000|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>  

A common assertion among fundamentalist Christians is that ''Harry Potter'' promotes the religion of [[Wicca]], and so keeping them in [[state school|public schools]] violates the [[Separation of church and state in the United States]].<ref name="Harry Potter expelled from school" /> In her response to [[Laura Mallory]]'s court case, education attorney Victoria Sweeny said that if schools were to remove all books containing reference to [[witchcraft|witches]], they would have to ban ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[Cinderella]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ban Harry Potter or face more school shootings|work=The Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=408490&in_page_id=1811|accessdate=2007-06-07 | location=London | date=2006-10-04}}</ref> 

[[Jeremiah Films]], a Christian video company largely known for its  ''[[The Clinton Chronicles|Clinton Chronicles]]'' release, also released a [[DVD]] entitled ''Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged'' which stated that "Harry's world says that drinking dead animal blood gives power, a satanic human sacrifice and Harry's powerful blood brings new life, [[spirit possession|demon possession]] is not spiritually dangerous, and that passing through fire, contacting the dead, and conversing with ghosts, others in the spirit world, and more, is normal and acceptable."<ref name="Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged">{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/0127.asp|publisher=Chick Publications|title=Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged|accessdate=2007-03-13|first=Caryl|last=Matrisciana}}</ref> 

In 2001, Evangelical journalist [[Richard Abanes]], who has written several books arguing against new religions and [[Mormonism]], published a [[polemic]]al text that made similar allegations to the video: ''Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick''. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between ''Harry Potter'' and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter, Narnia, and the Lord of the Rings|work=REviewers' Bookwatch|year=2006|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143162319.html|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that will enable them to replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like ''Harry Potter'', you can find references to [[astrology]], [[clairvoyance]], and [[numerology]]. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter: Harmless Christian Novel or Doorway to the Occult?|author= Belinda Elliott|work=CBN.com|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/OnlineDiscipleship/HarryPotterControversy/elliott_RichardAbanes.aspx|accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref>

[[File:Harrypottersatan.gif|thumb|Image from [[news satire|satirical newspaper]] ''[[The Onion]]'', which jokingly proclaimed that ''Harry Potter'' was leading children to [[Satanism]]]]
This religious fear has inspired at least two Internet [[urban legend]]s, both inspired by [[satire]]s unintentionally taken seriously. In 2001, ''[[The Onion]]'', an American [[news satire|satirical newspaper]], published an article entitled "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," which said, with implied irony, that the "High Priest of Satanism" had described Harry Potter as "an absolute godsend to our cause."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html |publisher=[[The Onion]]|title=Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism in Children|date=2000-07-26|accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20000815214418/http://www.theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html |archivedate = 2000-08-15}}</ref> Regardless, this article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as "proof" of their views.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snopes.com: Harry Potter|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/potter.asp|year=200|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> The following year the Canadian daily the ''[[National Post]]'' released a similar spoof article in its satirical column, ''Post Morten'',  saying that "Rowling<U+2014>or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan<U+2014>said that as she sat in a coffee shop one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" This article too was copied into a chain letter and released as "truth" onto the web.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Author Admits She's an Avowed Satanist-Fiction!|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/j/jkrowlings.htm|year=2002|work=Truthorfiction.com|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> 

In 2009, Matt Latimer, a former speechwriter for US President [[George W. Bush]], claimed that during the Bush administration, "people in the [[White House]]" had denied Rowling the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] because the books "encourage witchcraft."<ref>{{cite news|title=JK Rowling lost out on US medal over Harry Potter 'witchcraft'|author=Alison Flood|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/sep/29/harry-potter-rowling-medal|accessdate=2009-09-30 | location=London | date=2009-09-29}}</ref>

While some evangelical Christians consider ''Harry Potter'' related to Satanism, a poll indicated that this position remains a minority view; seven percent of Americans who have heard of the books have a negative view of them, with 52 percent having a positive opinion and the remaining 41 percent unsure.<ref>Jones, Jeffrey M.

In 2001 the Alamogordo Christ Community Church in New Mexico burned hundreds of copies of the Harry Potter books.  Jack Brock, leader of the church, said the books were an abomination because they inspired children to study the occult. He and his followers admitted they have never read any of the books, and tossed in some Stephen King novels. Venezuelian scholar Ferando Baez,  in a study of the history of censorship and book destruction commented, "There is more than one way to destroy a book, upon being denied a city permit to burn books, the Rev. Douglas Taylor in Lewiston, Maine, has held several annual gatherings at which he cuts the Potter books up with scissors."<ref>{{cite book|last=Baez|first=Fernando|title=A Universal History of the Destruction of Books|year=2008|publisher=Atlas & Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-1-934633-01-4|pages=228<U+2013>229}}</ref>

[[Methodism#Italy|Italian Methodist]] minister Peter Ciaccio analysed the relationship between J. K. Rowling's work and Christian theology, stating that the Harry Potter series is the positive outcome of the encounter of the Jewish-Christian tradition with other important features of the Western cultural heritage (namely Celtic, Nordic and Classical).<ref name=ciaccio>Peter Ciaccio, "Harry Potter and Christian Theology", in Elizabeth E.

=== Catholicism ===
The [[Catholic Church]] has taken no official position on the books, but various Catholics, including officials of the [[Roman Curia]], the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]], and other official bodies have presented mixed views on the subject.  

Beginning in 2001, Cardinal [[George Pell]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney|Archbishop of Sydney]], has occasionally written on the ''Harry Potter'' series in his regular [[column (newspaper)|column]] in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph (Australia)|The Sunday Telegraph]]''. In his columns, he praised the books for displaying values that are "deeply compatible with Christianity."<ref name="Pell 2007-09-23">{{cite news | author=[[George Pell]] | work=The Sunday Telegraph | date=23 September 2007 | title=Harry Potter And The Christians | accessdate=2007-10-22 }}</ref> In his book ''Be Not Afraid'', Pell praised the books as having a "good dose of moral truth" and for being "a good yarn."<ref>{{cite news|title= A fair world built on Man's transcendent dignity|author=Ruth Gledhill|publisher=Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article378904.ece|accessdate=2009-07-22 | location=London | date=2005-04-09}}</ref>

In 2003, Father Peter Fleetwood, a priest [[incardination and excardination|incardinated]] in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool|Archdiocese of Liverpool]] at the time serving as an official of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html | title=Presentations of the Holy See's document on "New Age" | author=[[Paul Poupard]] | year=2003 | publisher=[[Pontifical Council for Culture]] | accessdate=2007-07-27 }}</ref> made comments supportive of the novels during a press conference announcing the release of ''Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life<U+2014>A Christian reflection on the "New Age."'' In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the ''Harry Potter'' series should be considered in the same light as some [[New Age]] practices warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil. And she is very clear on this." He added that Rowling is "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even in her way of writing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,888638,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|title=Catholic church stands up for Harry Potter|date=2003-02-04 | location=London | accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_2722000/2722445.stm|publisher=BBC Newsround|title=Pope sticks up for Potter books|date=2003-02-03 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> though there is no evidence that the Pope officially approved of the novels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familylifecenter.net/article.asp?artId=146|publisher=LifeSite Newsl|title=Harry Potter Gets Vatican's Blessing?|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

Also in 2003, the Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger <U+2013> who later became [[Pope Benedict XVI]] <U+2013> received a manuscript of a book critical of the novels from a German author. He stated in a private letter expressing gratitude for the receipt of the book, "It is good that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, because those are subtle seductions, which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the [[soul]], before it can grow properly." He also recommended she send a copy of her book to Fleetwood at the Council for Culture. In a second letter, the cardinal gave the author permission to make his first letter public. These letters from Ratzinger prior to his elevation to the papacy have been used to suggest that the new pontiff is officially opposed to the novels.<ref name="Pope Opposes Harry Potter Novels">{{cite news|url=http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005/jul/05071301.html|publisher=LifeSite News|title=Pope Opposes Harry Potter Novels - Signed Letters from Cardinal Ratzinger Now Online|date=2005-07-13|accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref>

Criticism against the books also comes from one of the official [[exorcist]]s of the Archdiocese of Rome, Father [[Gabriele Amorth]], who believes that, "Behind Harry Potter hides the signature of the king of the darkness, [[Satan|the devil]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/devil-in-the-detail-vatican-exorcises-harry-potter/2006/08/31/1156817034534.html|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Devil in the detail: Vatican exorcises Harry Potter|date=2006-01-09|accessdate=2007-03-13|last=Morris|first=Linda}}</ref> He further told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that the books make a false distinction between black and white magic, while, in reality, the distinction "does not exist, because magic is always a turn to the devil." Amorth believes that the books can be a bad influence on children by getting them interested in the occult.

Before the release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' in 2005, Msgr. Fleetwood, then serving with the [[Council of European Episcopal Conferences]], gave an interview with [[Vatican Radio]]. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his positive opinion of the books, and remarked that then-Cardinal Ratzinger's letters may have been written by a member of the congregation's staff and simply signed by the prefect. He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.<ref name="Fleetwood transcript">{{cite web | url=http://catholicinsider.com/scripts/hp_transcript.php  | title=Speak of the Devil...

Essayist Paolo Gulisano said the ''Harry Potter'' novels offer lessons in the importance of love and self-giving,<ref>{{cite web|title=Writers in Vatican newspaper debate lessons of Harry Potter novels|author=Cindy Wooden|work=Catholic News Service|date=2008-01-15|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0800250.htm|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> but Professor Edoardo Rialti described Harry Potter as "the wrong kind of hero" and said that, "Despite several positive values that can be found in the story, at the foundations of this tale is the proposal that of witchcraft as positive, the violent manipulation of things and people thanks to the knowledge of the occult, an advantage of a select few: the ends justify the means because the knowledgeable, the chosen ones, the intellectuals know how to control the dark powers and turn them into good<U+2026> This is a grave and deep lie, because it is the old Gnostic temptation of confusing salvation and truth with a secret knowledge."<ref>{{cite web|title=Vatican slams Harry Potter as 'wrong kind of hero'|year=2008|publisher=christiantoday.com|author= Katherine T Phan|url=

A French [[Traditionalist Catholic]] circle has published a thorough critical study of the Harry Potter series along the lines of [[demonology]], with the title - in English translation -  ''Harry Potter and the Order of Darkness''.<ref name=Mikael>{{cite book|last=Mikael|first=Mona|title=Harry Potter et l'ordre des t<U+00E9>n<U+00E8>bres|year=2007|publisher=Editions Saint-Remi ESR|location=Cadillac|isbn=978-2-84519-707-7|pages=446}}</ref>

=== Orthodox ===
In 2002, the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] authorities in [[Thrace]] released a statement denouncing the ''Harry Potter'' books as Satanic, saying that they "acquaint people with evil, wizardry, the occult and [[demonology]]." The statement also criticised the purported similarities between Harry Potter and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], saying, "It is beyond doubt that Harry was made to resemble a young savior. Upon his birth people try to kill him, he is forever subjected to injustice but always supernaturally manages to prevail and save others. Let us reflect, who else <U+2026> is held to be the unjustly treated God?"<ref name=thrace />
In June 2004, soon after a [[Bulgarians|native Bulgarian]], [[Stanislav Ianevski]], had been cast to portray the character [[Viktor Krum]] in [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] printed a front-page article in their official newspaper, claiming that "magic is not a children's game," and that the holy Synod had advised that a church in [[Sofia]] hold special [[Divine Liturgy|liturgies]] every Thursday to cure those afflicted by spells or possessed by evil spirits. Pamphlets were posted throughout the city, claiming that reciting a ''Harry Potter'' spell "is as if you are praying to [[evil]]", and that "God hates magic."<ref name=bulgaria />

However, the Russian Orthodox [[apologetics|apologist]] deacon Andrei Kuraev argued in his 2003 book ''Harry Potter in the Church: Between an Anathema and a Smile'' that the Harry Potter books are not dangerous. His arguments include the books' similarity with traditional fairy tales and literary classics such as the ''[[Iliad]]'' which no-one calls "Satanic"; the difference between the books' magic and real occult practices; the presence of Christian values such as humility, love, sacrifice and choosing the right over the easy. He quotes other notable Orthodox priests and church officials such as M. Kozlov and S. Pravdoliubov as supporting his position.<ref><U+0414><U+0438><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041A><U+0443><U+0440><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432>. <U+0413><U+0430><U+0440><U+0440><U+0438> <U+041F><U+043E><U+0442><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440> <U+0432> <U+0426><U+0435><U+0440><U+043A><U+0432><U+0438>: <U+043C><U+0435><U+0436><U+0434><U+0443> <U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0444><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0438> <U+0443><U+043B><U+044B><U+0431><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439>.

The American academic and Orthodox Christian writer [[John Granger]] has analyzed the literature in a positive light. Granger, a Christian [[classicism|classicist]], has defended the books in his book, ''Looking for God in Harry Potter''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Looking for God in Harry Potter | author=Austin Cline | url=http://atheism.about.com/od/bookreviews/fr/GodHarryPotter.htm | accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> Granger argues that the books do not promote the occult because none of the magic is based on summoning any sort of demon or spirit; he contrasts occult ''invocational'' magic (calling up spirit beings to do your bidding) with literature's common ''incantational'' magic (saying a set phrase to use power from an unspecified source). Indeed, says Granger, the themes of love triumphing over death and choosing what is right instead of what is easy are very compatible with Christianity.

=== Anglicanism ===
In 2000, the Dean of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] refused to allow his church to be filmed as part of [[Hogwarts]] in the ''Harry Potter'' film series, saying that it was unfitting for a Christian church to be used to promote pagan imagery.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS News in the media: 2000 to 2003|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/potter4.htm|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> [[Gloucester Cathedral]] agreed to take its place; the Dean of Gloucester, the Very Reverend Nicholas Bury, admitted to being a fan of the books; "I think the book is a marvellous traditional children's story and excellently written. It is also amusing, exciting and wholesome, and is just the sort of story families should be encouraged to read."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter goes to church|work=BBC News|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/871240.stm|year=2000|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> The decision still resulted in many angry letters to the local paper, the ''Gloucester Citizen''. Said one honorary chaplain, "Oh yes, there was quite a to-do. There was one particular man, very evangelical, writing in and complaining that it wasn't right for such things to be going on.

Then-[[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey]] gave positive remarks about the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' film]] in his New Year Message for 2002, calling it "great fun," and a film that "asks some very real questions" on moral issues.<ref>Carey, George (31 December 2001).

In June 2007, the Anglican Church published ''Mixing it up with Harry Potter'', a 48-page book designed to use parallels from the novels to teach the faith to 9<U+2013>13-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Church House Bookshop: Mixing it up with Harry Potter|url=http://www.chbookshop.co.uk/books/9780715141069/Mixing-it-Up-with-Harry-Potter|accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref> The author of the book, [[Kent]] youth worker Owen Smith, argued that, "These sessions draw parallels between events in the world of Harry and his friends, and the world in which we are seeking to proclaim the gospel to young people [...]  To say, as some have, that these books draw younger readers towards the occult seems to me both to malign J. K.

== Islam ==
A number of Islamic scholars have argued that the books' magical themes conflict with [[Islam]]ic teachings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter: Facts about Fiction|author=Khalid Baig|work=Albalagh|url=http://www.albalagh.net/current_affairs/harry_potter.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Who?

In 2002, the books were banned in schools across the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). According to a spokesman from the education ministry of the UAE government, the books' [[fantasy]] and [[Magic in fiction|magic]] elements were contrary to Islamic values. Despite being banned from schools in the Emirates, there are no plans to ban them from bookshops within the country.<ref name=UAE />

In August 2007, police in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] discovered and defused a [[car bomb]] located outside a shopping centre where, hours later, the final ''Harry Potter'' novel was scheduled to go on sale. The book launch was postponed in response. A local police superintendent commented that, "We are not sure so far whether the target of the bombing was the book launch, but the connection cannot be ruled out."<ref>{{cite web|title=Terrorist attack at the Potter book launch site foiled in Pakistan|work=Deutsche Presse Agentur|year=2007|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/07/21/headlines/headlines_30041840.php|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> 

While the ''Harry Potter'' books are available for sale in [[Iran]], an editorial in the 26 July 2007 edition of the state-run newspaper ''[[Kayhan]]'', which has ties to Iran's Supreme Leader, the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]], criticised Iran's Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry for approving the distribution of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel.<ref name=Iran /> The editorial claimed that the book, "includes destructive words and sentences which oppose to the values [of the Islamic Republic]," and that  airport security had failed by "[trusting] the American-British publisher which has [[Zionism|Zionist]] collaborators, such as [[Warner Bros.]]." The editorial described the books as a "Zionist project" and claimed that "Zionists had spent billions of dollars" on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and Zionism, the Untold Story (Updated)|work=Kamangir (Archer)|year=2007|url=http://kamangir.net/2007/07/25/harry-potter-sealed-boxes-and-zionism/|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> In 2009, the [[Middle East Media Research Institute]] translated a documentary on Iranian television about the ''Harry Potter'' film series that alleges, "The creation of new stories, based on mythical themes of witchcraft and devil worship, has always been a tool used by contemporary Zionists, and it is once again used in recent years, now more visibly than ever, targeting innocent children and youth."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsHUfl9xEE "Iranian TV Presents: Harry Potter and the Ziono-Hollywoodist Conspiracy."] ''[[YouTube]]''.  12 February 2009.  2 March 2009.</ref>

The decision to release the final volume of the ''Harry Potter'' series, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', in [[Israel]] at 2 AM on a Saturday morning briefly angered many of Israel's rabbis, since it fell during the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]], a time when business dealings are forbidden.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harry Potter's Israel launch pits wizard vs rabbis|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP-A/idUSL1893019220070718|work=Reuters|accessdate=2007-11-10 | date=2007-07-18}}</ref>

In 1999, in response to complaints from three local parents, [[Zeeland, Michigan]] school superintendent Gary Feenstra restricted access to the ''Harry Potter'' books to those pupils whose parents gave written permission.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan School Superintendent Restricts Harry Potter Books|work=American Library Association|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/1999/december1999/michiganschool.cfm|year=199|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> Later reports claimed that the parents were concerned about the books' magical and witchcraft-related themes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Speech Victory in Zeeland|work=kidspeakonline.org|url=http://www.kidspeakonline.org/fighthp_zeeland.html|year=1999|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> In response, children began a letter-writing campaign, forming clubs and organising petitions, which ultimately merged into an internet site called Muggles for Harry Potter.

In 2000, The Public Library system of [[Jacksonville, Florida]] was faced with a lawsuit from [[conservatism|conservative]] Christian group Liberty Counsel of Orlando after they began awarding "Hogwarts<U+2019> Certificate of Accomplishment" to young readers who completed the fourth ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''.

In 2002, in [[York, Pennsylvania]], local parent Deb DiEugenio, along with her pastor, attempted to have the books banned from her daughter's school.

In 2003, Billy Ray and Mary Nell Counts, a couple in [[Cedarville, Arkansas]],  brought suit against the local school board on behalf of their daughter to contest a rule requiring parents' written consent to read the ''Harry Potter'' books. A parent, Angie Haney, had requested such a rule on the grounds that they were "not based on fiction," at the prompting of Pastor Mark Hodges, who was also a member of the school board. A [[Jimm Larry Hendren|district court judge]] decided the rule was unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/april2003/judgesmitesharry.cfm|publisher=American Library Association|title=Judge Smites Harry Potter Restrictions in Arkansas|accessdate=2007-03-13|date=2003-04-28}}  The district court's opinion can be found [http://www.prbsklaw.com/documents/02-2155-mo-wp.pdf here.]</ref> The decision was cited as precedent in subsequent censorship cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fayetteville Rethinks Restricted Reads|work=American Library Association|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2005abc/september2005abc/fayetteback.cfm|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> Also in 2003, a [[Russians|Russian]] woman filed charges against Rosman Publishing, responsible for ''Harry Potter'''s Russian translation, saying that the books "instilled religious extremism and prompted students to join religious organizations of Satanist followers".<ref name=Moscow>{{cite web|title=Russian Prosecutor: Harry Potter Isn't Satanic|work=American Libraries Online|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/january2003/russianprosecutor.cfm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> A probe found that there were no grounds for a criminal prosecution.

In September 2005, Laura Mallory, a mother of four children in [[Loganville, Georgia]], attempted to have the ''Harry Potter'' books banned from her children's school library on the grounds that they promoted a religion, [[Wicca]], and thus for a public school library to hold them would violate the separation of church and state.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|title=Next installment of mom vs. Potter set for Gwinnett court|author=Ben Smith|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/gwinnett/stories/2007/05/28/0529metPOTTER.html |year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070601155533/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/gwinnett/stories/2007/05/28/0529metPOTTER.html |archivedate = 2007-06-01}}</ref><ref name=mallory1>{{Cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15127464/ |title=Georgia mom seeks Harry Potter ban|publisher=[[MSNBC.com]]|date = 4 October 2006|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> On her website, she states, "Harry Potter is being used to teach and promote witchcraft, Wicca, a U.S. [Government] recognised religion, in our schools, classrooms, and to this entire generation."<ref name=mallory2>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Appeal Update|author=Laura Mallory|url=http://www.hisvoicetoday.org/hpappeal.htm|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> Mallory said the books carry "evil themes, witchcraft, demonic activity, murder, evil blood sacrifice, spells and teaching children all of this."

In July 2006, Sariya Allan, a teaching assistant at Durand Primary School in [[Stockwell]], [[South London]], quit her job after she was suspended for refusing to listen to a seven-year-old pupil read a ''Harry Potter'' book in class. A practising [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], she told the girl that "I don't do witchcraft in any form," and that she would be "cursed" if she heard the novel recited. Allan took her dispute with the school to an [[Employment Tribunal]], citing religious discrimination and claiming for damages.

In September 2007, Pastor Ron Barker of St. Joseph Church in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]] received international attention after pulling the books from the shelves of the parish's K-8 school. According to the ALA, this was the first time the books were banned in Massachusetts. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]] claimed this was an independent action in which the Church played no role. "It may be a great series, but for some it is a vehicle for entering into some occult practices," he said. "Sorcery and witchcraft are not appropriate subjects for a Catholic school and I do not want parents or children thinking we approve of them in our library."<ref>{{cite web|title=Pastor removes Harry Potter books from school library|author=Gary Band|year=2008|work=Wakefield Observer|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/wakefield/archive/x1086964294|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> He claimed his actions were no different from protecting children with a [[peanut allergy]]; "What I did is start a spiritual peanut butter ban on Harry Potter," he said.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholic School Bans Harry Potter|work=thebostonchannel.com|year=2008|url=St. Joseph<U+2019>s school |accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref>

== Responses to criticism ==
=== Wicca ===
In response to the criticism that the books promote [[Wicca]], a number of Wiccans and other commenters have argued that the critics' definition of Wicca tends to lump together many and various spiritualist practices that actually have little in common. They have also highlighted the differences between magic within Wicca, which is [[invocation]]al and derives from the divine powers, and that depicted by the ''Harry Potter'' books, which is a purely mechanical application of spells without invoking any deities. A Wiccan review of ''Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged'' pointed out that "communing with the dead and spirit world, sorcery, curses, occult symbology, black magic [and] demon possession"<U+2014>all cited by the book as evidence of ''Harry Potter'' promoting Wicca<U+2014>are not part of Wiccan belief.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews of the video by Jeremiah Films: "Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged"|work=religioustolerance.org|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/potter9.htm|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> 

Divinatory practices such as [[scrying]] and [[astrology]], although occasionally employed by characters in the books are neither unique nor central to the Wiccan religion<ref name=wicca>{{cite web|title=Six different, unrelated, forms of Witchcraft: Harry Potter to Wicca|work=religioustolerance.org|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pott2.htm#so|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> and are treated in the novels in a condescending, tongue-in-cheek manner; the school divination teacher is, according to writer Christine Schoeffer, "a misty, dreamy, dewy charlatan,"<ref name=trelawney>{{cite web|publisher=Salon.com| url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/01/13/potter/index.html| title=Harry Potter's girl trouble| first= Christine| last=Schoeffer| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref> who is ridiculed by the students and staff alike. In the ''Harry Potter'' universe, Schoeffer claims, "the entire intuitive tradition of fortune-telling <U+2026> is discredited."<ref name=trelawney/> 

The website [[religioustolerance.org]] says, in their analysis of Chick's "The Nervous Witch", that the comic's heroine cries that 'she got into "The Craft" (i.e. Wicca) "Through the Harry Potter books! We wanted his powers <U+2026> so we called for spirit guides. Then they came into us." In reality, [[spirit guide]]s are unrelated to the Witchcraft in the ''Harry Potter'' books and are not sought by Wiccans. They are a [[New Age]] phenomenon.'<ref>{{cite web|title=NEGATIVE REVIEWS BY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS TO THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS|work=religioustolerance.org|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/potter2.htm|year=2000|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

=== Occult vs. fantasy and fairytale magic ===
Regardless, statements such as those in ''Witchcraft Repackaged'' that the books depict actual [[occult]]ist practices of any kind have been roundly criticised. Christian writer Stephen D. Greydanus writes that the magic of the ''Harry Potter'' novels is not the ritualistic, invocative magic of Wicca or occultism but the same "fantasy" magic practised in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]; "If anything, the magic in Rowling's world is even more emphatically imaginary, even further removed from real-world practices, than that of Tolkien or Lewis; and, like theirs, presents no appreciable risk of direct imitative behaviour."<ref name=Greydanus>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter vs. Gandalf|author=Stephen D. Greydanus|url=http://www.decentfilms.com/sections/articles/magic.html|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>  ''Christianity Today'' columnist [[Charles Colson]] asserts that the magic in ''Harry Potter'' is "purely mechanical, as opposed to occultic. That is, Harry and his friends cast spells, read crystal balls, and turn themselves into animals<U+2014>but they don't make contact with a supernatural world. [It's not] the kind of real-life witchcraft the Bible condemns."<ref name= Olsen /> Austin Cline notes that, "The Harry Potter books simply aren't about Wicca as it is currently practiced. J.K Rowling researched Wiccan practices and incorporated a few elements in order to give her books a bit more of an air of reality, but she and Wicca are drawing upon the same corpus of ancient traditions and stories so similarities are inevitable. They certainly aren't a sign that the books work to "indoctrinate" people into Wicca as a religion."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Books to Blame for School Shootings|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/a/258279.htm|author=Austin Cline|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref>

In his book, John Granger makes what he thinks a critical distinction between what he calls the dangerous ''invocational'' magic (calling a spirit) and Rowling's ''incantational'' magic, in which the formula one speaks gets the job done, and says that her presentation to the materialistic world that there is more out there than is visible is doing a service for the cause of Christian evangelism.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Granger|title=Looking for God in Harry Potter|publisher=SaltRiver|year=2006}}</ref>

Connie Neal has commented that, "there are 64 real references to witchcraft in the first four ''Harry Potter'' books, but you have to see them in context to know they are not teaching witchcraft or sorcery. Many of the detractors who have actually read the books already have made up their mind that ''Harry Potter'' is evil before they read. They have taken a magnifying glass and picked at the books, using literary [[reductionism]] to find what they want to find. You can pick up [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' and do the same thing that these people have done with ''Harry Potter''; it is ridiculous."<ref name=Neal>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Christian Cauldron|work=The Rutherford Institute|url=http://www.rutherford.org/Oldspeak/Articles/Religion/oldspeak-harry_potter2.asp|accessdate=2007-07-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070615005213/http://www.rutherford.org/oldspeak/articles/religion/oldspeak-harry_potter2.asp <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Massimo Introvigne]], an Italian expert in emerging religious movements, criticised the Fundamentalist impulse to distrust fantasy. "Fundamentalists reject, or even burn, all products of contemporary popular culture, because their modes of production, languages and styles are not intrinsically Christian [...] Most children understand that magic is used in fairy tales and juvenile supernatural fiction as a century-old language, and that this is fiction, not reality. If we dismiss the use of magic as a language, we should at least be fundamentalist to the bitter end, and go against "Mary Poppins," "Peter Pan," and "Sleeping Beauty," and insist that Cinderella puts a [[burqa|burkha]] on."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fundamentalism Afoot in Anti-Potter Camp, Says New-Religions Expert Popular Culture Enjoys an Autonomy, Explains Massimo Introvigne

=== Secularism ===
Another response to the claim that the books promote the religion of witchcraft, which has been raised as much by Christians critical of the books as those who support them, is that, far from promoting religion, the books do not promote religion in any way. Apart from celebrating [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] and a non-denominational clergyman presiding at both Dumbledore's funeral and the Weasleys' wedding, religious practices are largely absent from the books. In her critical editorial on the books, [[Focus on the Family]]'s Lindy Beam comments, "The spiritual fault of ''Harry Potter'' is not so much that Rowling is playing to dark supernatural powers, but that she doesn't acknowledge any supernatural powers at all. These stories are not fueled [sic] by witchcraft, but by secularism."<ref name=Olsen /> The ''Harry Potter'' books have been lauded by [[atheism|atheist]]s and [[secularism|secularist]]s for their determinedly non-religious outlook. Mika LaVaque-Manty of the liberal website Left2Right notes, "Religion plays no role in the books. There are no churches, no other religious institutions, nobody prays or meditates, and even funerals are non-religious affairs."<ref name=nogod /> In an article written for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine before the publication of the seventh and final book in the series entitled "Who Dies in Harry Potter? God," [[Lev Grossman]] argues that, "Harry Potter lives in a world free of any religion or spirituality of any kind. He lives surrounded by ghosts but has no one to pray to, even if he were so inclined, which he isn't." Grossman goes on to contrast ''[[Harry Potter]]'' with other, more explicitly religious fantasies, such as [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who Dies in Harry Potter?

=== Rowling's response ===
J.K. Rowling has repeatedly denied that her books lead children into witchcraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm|title=Harry Potter and Me|publisher=BBC|date=2001-12-28|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>  In an interview with [[CNN]] in 1999, she said,<ref>{{cite web|title=Success of Harry Potter bowls author over|work=cnn.com|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-guardian-yates.htm|year=1999|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

<blockquote>"I absolutely did not start writing these books to encourage any child into witchcraft. I'm laughing slightly because to me, the idea is absurd. I have met thousands of children and not even one time has a child come up to me and said, "Ms Rowling, I'm so glad I've read these books because now I want to be a witch."</blockquote>

In an interview  on the  ''[[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|Donny & Marie Show]]'' in 1999, Rowling said that "You have a perfect right, of course, as every parent does, and I'm a parent, to decide what your child is exposed to. You do not have the right to decide what everyone else's children are exposed to. So that's how I feel about it".<ref name="donnymarie">{{cite web  | last = Osmond  | first = Danny | coauthors = Marie Osmond  | title =Interview of J.K.

"People underestimate children so hugely", Rowling said when asked about the controversy in the 2001 documentary ''Harry Potter and Me'', "They know it's fiction. When people are arguing from that kind of standpoint, I don't think reason works tremendously well. But I would be surprised if some of them had read the books at all."<ref>{{cite web|title="Harry Potter and Me" (BBC Christmas Special, British version)|work=BBC|year=2001|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref>

== Christianity in the novels ==
While many describe the books as secular or Satanic, many writers, including Rowling herself, have gone to great lengths to demonstrate that the books actively promote Christian values.

Rowling attended a [[Church of Scotland]] congregation while writing ''Harry Potter'' and her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised into that faith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charmed, I'm Sure|author= Linton Weeks|work=The Washington Post|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-post-weeks.htm|year=1999|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> "I go to church myself", she told MTV in 2007, "I don't take any responsibility for the lunatic fringes of my own religion".<ref name= conference>{{cite web|title='Harry Potter' Author J.K.

<blockquote>"Yes, I am, which seems to offend the religious right far worse than if I said I thought there was no God. Every time I've been asked if I believe in God, I've said yes, because I do, but no one ever really has gone any more deeply into it than that, and I have to say that does suit me, because if I talk too freely about that I think the intelligent reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books."</blockquote>

"Personally", she said of her religious faith, "I think you can see that in the books. Of course, Hogwarts is a multifaith school."<ref>{{cite web|title=Magical experience for Harry Potter fans|author= Karen Lindell  |work=Ventura County Star|year=2007|url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/oct/21/magical-experience-for-harry-potter-fans/|accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> Rowling claims to have been very careful not to colour her novels in an overtly religious way, lest one faith be given prominence over any other.<ref name=womanyear /> Rowling said that to her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious".<ref name=Baltimore>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-vancouversun-wyman.htm|title='You can lead a fool to a book but you can't make them think'|publisher=Vancouver Sun|date=2000-10-26|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, "because that, that is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble."<ref name=Baltimore /> In an interview with [[MTV]] after the publication of the last book, she is quoted as saying, "To me [the religious parallels have] always been obvious, but I never wanted to talk too openly about it because I thought it might show people who just wanted the story where we were going."<ref>{{cite web|title=J.K.

In 2007, Rowling described her religious background in an interview with the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] newspaper ''[[De Volkskrant]]'':<ref>{{cite web|title=New Interview with J.K. Rowling for Release of Dutch Edition of "Deathly Hallows"|work=The Leaky Cauldron|year=2007|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/11/19/new-interview-with-j-k-rowling-for-release-of-dutch-edition-of-deathly-hallows|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>

<blockquote>"I was officially raised in the Church of England, but I was actually more of a freak in my family. We didn't talk about religion in our home. My father didn't believe in anything, neither did my sister. My mother would incidentally visit the church, but mostly during Christmas. And I was immensely curious. From when I was 13, 14 I went to church alone. I found it very interesting what was being said there, and I believed in it. When I went to university, I became more critical. I got more annoyed with the smugness of religious people and I went to church less and less. Now I'm at the point where I started: yes, I believe. And yes, I go to the church. A protestant church here in Edinburgh. My husband is also raised protestant, but he comes from a very strict Scottish group. One where they couldn't sing and talk."</blockquote>

Rowling has occasionally expressed ambivalence about her religious faith. In a 2006 interview with ''[[Tatler]]'' magazine, Rowling noted that, "like [[Graham Greene]], my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me."<ref>{{cite web|title=Special JK|author=Geordie Greig|year=2006|work=Tatler|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0110-tatler-grieg.html|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref> In a British documentary, ''JK Rowling: A Year in the Life'', when asked if she believed in God, she said, "Yes.

When asked if she believed in an afterlife, she said, "Yes; I think I do."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hog's Head|url=http://thehogshead.org/2008/01/05/jk-rowling-documentary/|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref> In a 2008 interview with the Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa<U+00ED>s]]'', Rowling said, "I feel very drawn to religion, but at the same time I feel a lot of uncertainty.

=== Rowling and the Inklings ===
Several Christian writers have compared Rowling to the [[Inklings]], a group that included [[C. S. Lewis]], [[J. R. R.

Other Christian writers find Rowling's treatment of magic less acceptable than Lewis's and Tolkien's. In his essay "Harry Potter vs. Gandalf," Steven D. Greydanus notes that in the works of Tolkien and Lewis, magic is confined to alien realms with their own laws, whereas Rowling's world coexists with our own; he thinks this is wrong: "Lewis goes to great lengths to make clear just how dangerous and wrong, how incompatible with Christianity, is any form of attempted magic in our world."<ref name=Greydanus /> John Andrew Murray similarly observes that Rowling's work portrays magic as a natural force to be manipulated, while Lewis and Tolkien portray magic as a gift bestowed by a higher power: "Despite superficial similarities, Rowling's and Lewis' worlds are as far apart as east is from west. Rowling's work invites children to a world where witchcraft is 'neutral' and where authority is determined solely by one's cleverness. Lewis invites readers to a world where God's authority is not only recognised, but celebrated <U+2014> a world that resounds with His goodness and care."<ref name=Neal/>

Rowling's attitude toward the Inklings, and to Lewis in particular, has undergone change. In 1998, in one of her earliest interviews, she said that she had a lifelong love of C. S. Lewis. "Even now, if I was in a room with one of the Narnia books I would pick it up like a shot and re-read it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Charms a Nation|author=Helena de Bertodano|work=The Daily Telegraph|year=1998|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1998/0798-telegraph-bertodano.html|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>  However, in later interviews she expressed a different opinion. "I adored [Lewis' books] when I was a child," she told the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' in 2001, "I got so caught up I didn't think C. S. Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal."<ref>{{cite web | author= Renton, Jennie| title=The story behind the Potter legend: JK Rowling talks about how she created the Harry Potter books and the magic of Harry Potter's world|work=Sydney Morning Herald| url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1001-sydney-renton.htm
|accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> In an interview with Lev Grossman in 2005, she said, "There comes a point [in Lewis' ''[[The Last Battle]]''] where Susan, who was the older girl, is lost to Narnia because she becomes interested in lipstick. She's become irreligious basically because she found sex. I have a big problem with that."<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-time-grossman.htm "J.K. Rowling Hogwarts And All"], 2005. Lev Grossman. ''TIME Magazine''. Accessed: 25 October 2007</ref> 

"I did not set out to convert anyone to Christianity," she told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 2007; "I wasn't trying to do what C. S. Lewis did. It is perfectly possible to live a very moral life without a belief in God, and I think it's perfectly possible to live a life peppered with ill-doing and believe in God."<ref name=womanyear />

As regards Tolkien, Rowling said in 2000 that "I didn't read ''[[The Hobbit]]'' until after the first Harry book was written, though I read ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' when I was nineteen. I think, setting aside the obvious fact that we both use myth and legend, that the similarities are fairly superficial. Tolkien created a whole new mythology, which I would never claim to have done. On the other hand, I think I have better jokes."<ref>{{cite news

=== Christian allegories in ''Deathly Hallows'' ===
A number of commentators have drawn attention to the Biblical themes and references in her final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. In an August 2007 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'', Lisa Miller commented that Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. She points out the title of the chapter in which this occurs<U+2014>"King's Cross"<U+2014>a possible allusion to Christ's cross. Also, she outlines the scene in which Harry is temporarily dead, pointing out that it places Harry in a very heaven-like setting where he talks to a father figure "whose supernatural powers are accompanied by a profound message of love". Miller argues that these parallels make it difficult to believe that the basis of the stories is Satanic.<ref>Miller, Lisa. "Christ-like". ''Newsweek''. Published: 2007-08-06 Vol. 150 Iss. 6 pg. 12 ISSN: 00289604</ref> There is also speculation from [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron's]] [[podcast]], [[PotterCast]], episode 115 entitled "Those Deathly Hallows," in the Canon Conclusion segment with [[Steve Vander Ark]], that the Hallows act as a parallel to the Holy Trinity; Harry accepts death as did Jesus, they both come back from death, and defeat the Devil/Voldemort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/pottercast/?p=483|title=PotterCast 115: Those Deathly Hallows|publisher=The Leaky Cauldron|accessdate=2011-09-29}}</ref>  Jeffrey Weiss adds, in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', that the biblical quotation "And the last enemy that shall be defeated is death,"<ref>1st Corinthians 15:26</ref> featured on the tombstones of Harry's parents, refers to Christ's victory over death at the end of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Themes Abound in the Harry Potter books|author=Jeffrey Weiss|work=Dallas Morning News|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-weiss_28edi.ART.State.Edition1.2758dd6.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070826120632/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-weiss_28edi.ART.State.Edition1.2758dd6.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2007-08-26}}</ref> The quotation on Dumbledore's family tomb, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also", is from Matthew 6:21, and refers to knowing which things in life are of true value.<ref name=brown/>  "They're very British books," Rowling revealed to an Open Book conference in October 2007, "So on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones, [but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, <U+2026> almost epitomise the whole series."<ref name=conference /> 

''Deathly Hallows'' begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] leader [[William Penn]] and one from [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Libation Bearers]]''. "I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition", Rowling said. "I'd known it was going to be those two passages since 'Chamber' was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd queued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do."<ref name= conference /> 

Raymond Keating also outlines several Christian themes of the last book in an article in ''[[Newsday]]'', concluding that "It's possible to read ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''Narnia'' without recognizing the religious aspects. That's even more so the case with ''Harry Potter''. But Christian themes are there nonetheless".<ref>Keating, Raymond J. "Harry Potter and the Christian allegory." ''Newsday'' (New York) Pub: 2007-08-13 Pg. A35</ref> Christian commentator Jerry Bowyer says of Rowling's "fundamentalist bashers",<ref name=bowyer>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/JerryBowyer/2007/08/02/harry_potter_and_the_fire_breathing_fundamentalists?page=full&comments=true|title=Harry Potter and the Fire breathing Fundamentalists|author=Jerry Bowyer|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-18| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023013056/http://townhall.com/Columnists/JerryBowyer/2007/08/02/harry_potter_and_the_fire_breathing_fundamentalists?page=full&comments=true| archivedate = October 23, 2007}}</ref> "So much of the religious right failed to see the Christianity in the ''Potter'' novels because it knows so little Christianity itself [...] The gospel stories themselves, the various metaphors and figures of the Law and the Prophets, and their echoes down through the past two millennia of Christian literature and art are largely unknown to vast swaths of American Christendom."<ref name=bowyer /> As regards Rowling's belief that discussing her faith would spoil the books, Bowyer says, "For once, I disagree with her: I don't think [the bashers] would have guessed the ending. Most of them can't recognise the ending of the story even after it's been told."<ref name=bowyer />

In her appraisal of the series, ''The Mystery of Harry Potter: A Catholic Family Guide'', author [[Nancy Carpentier Brown]] writes,<ref name=brown>{{cite web|title=The Last Chapter|author=Nancy Carpentier Brown|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|year=2007|url=http://www.osv.com/Portals/0/images/pdf/TheLastChapter.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-28}} Kept at: [http://www.osv.com/BooksNav/TheMysteryofHarryPotter/tabid/3880/Default.aspx OSV.com]</ref>
<blockquote>"After burying the remains of Mad-Eye Moody, Harry "marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand." Now, if they were true Wiccans, wouldn<U+2019>t he have gouged a
pentagram? When Harry finally has the chance to face Voldemort (Tom Riddle) and possibly kill him, Harry pauses and offers Voldemort a chance, saying, "Show some remorse." ... Giving a person a chance to redeem themselves, to begin to realise your own sins, by showing remorse, shows a Christian theme to the story."</blockquote>

== Dumbledore's sexual orientation ==
On 19 October 2007, Rowling spoke at [[New York]]'s [[Carnegie Hall]]. When asked by a fan whether [[Albus Dumbledore]], the books' wise mentor-figure, "who believed in the prevailing power of love, ever [fell] in love himself", Rowling replied,

<blockquote>"My truthful answer to you <U+2026> I always thought of Dumbledore as gay. <U+2026> Dumbledore fell in love with [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and that added to his horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was <U+2026> falling in love can blind us to an extent <U+2026> he was very drawn to this brilliant person, and horribly, terribly let down by him."<ref name=cauldron>{{cite web|title=J.

The statement was met with an ovation from the audience. "If I'd known it would make you so happy, I would have announced it years ago!" Rowling said.<ref name=cauldron /> In an appearance three days later in [[Toronto]], she responded to questions about Dumbledore's "outing" by saying that she had decided his sexuality "from very early on. Probably before the first book was published."<ref name="Toronto Press Conference">{{cite web|title=Toronto Press Conference|work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|year=2007|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1022-torontopressconf.html|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref>

Christians critical of both ''Harry Potter'' and homosexuality responded pointedly to the revelation. Christian author Berit Kjos wrote, 

<blockquote>"My first response was, "Thank you, Lord," because this helps us show others that these books should not be used in the churches to illustrate Christianity. Because Dumbledore has been revealed as a homosexual, it helps me communicate my message. It helps Christians who are concerned about the use of Harry Potter books in churches, because it makes it very clear that these books are not intended to be Christian, that Rowling isn't speaking as a Christian. She has introduced values that are contrary to the Biblical message."<ref>{{cite news|title=Outing Dumbledore sparks fierce debate|author=Raju Mudhar|work=thestar.com|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Books/article/269449|accessdate=2007-10-27 | location=Toronto | date=2007-10-23}}</ref></blockquote>

Laura Mallory responded to the Rowling's statement by telling U.S. network ABC, "My prayer is that parents would wake up, that the subtle way this is presented as harmless fantasy would be exposed for what it really is: a subtle indoctrination into anti-Christian values <U+2026> A homosexual lifestyle is a harmful one.

Will it become something more like a sad disability, one that the "mean religious right" targets for nefarious purposes?"<ref name=harvey /></blockquote>

"It's very disappointing that the author would have to make one of the characters gay," said Roberta Combs, president of the [[Christian Coalition of America]], "It's not a good example for our children, who really like the books and the movies. It encourages homosexuality."<ref name=coalition>{{cite news|title=JK Rowling under fire from US Bible belt after outing Dumbledore as gay|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=490261&in_page_id=1811|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=2007-10-31 | location=London | date=2007-10-28}}</ref> On 27 October 2007, [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] called for a ban on the books.<ref name= coalition />

Rowling commented on the dispute in an interview with the BBC. "Do I think a gay person can be a moral compass? I think it's ludicrous that we are asking that question in the 21st century. The Christian fundamentalists were never my base."<ref>{{cite news|title=Harry Potter author JK Rowling pens new tale|work=couriermail.com.au|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22690765-7642,00.html|date=1 November 2007}} Accessed: 1 November 2007</ref>

John Granger, in his blog, reposted the negative reactions of many Christians:

<blockquote>"The media presentation of the event as Ms. Rowling<U+2019>s endorsement of homosexuality and an anti-faith agenda was straight from [[Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter<U+2019>s]] notebook and part of their endless campaign to convince the public that Ms. Rowling is the enemy of their enemy, namely, the Church; the anguished and disappointed response of many Christian readers to these reports was also according to Culture War formula and in keeping with a hyper-extended understanding of the word ''gay.'' "Dumbledore is gay" no more makes the books an invitation to homosexuality or contrary to orthodox Christian belief than ''Sorcerer<U+2019>s Stone'' made them a "gateway to the occult."<ref>{{cite web|title=I always thought of Dumbledore as gay." [ovation.]|author=John Granger|work=hogwartsprofessor.com|year=2007|url=http://hogwartsprofessor.com/?p=198|accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref></blockquote>

Catholic fantasy author Regina Doman wrote an essay titled "In Defense of Dumbledore," in which she argued that the books actually support Catholic teaching on homosexuality because Dumbledore's relationship with the dark wizard Grindelwald leads to obviously terrible results, as he becomes interested in dark magic himself, neglects his responsibilities towards his younger sister and ultimately causes her death.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Dumbledore |author=Regina Doman|work=therambleronline.com|year=2007|url=http://therambleronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=181&Itemid=1}}</ref>

Despite Rowling stating that "he (Dumbledore) is my character and as my character, I have the right to know what I know about him and say what I say about him",<ref name="Toronto Press Conference"/> a number of commentators have argued that Rowling's claim has no weight, as there is no indication anywhere in the novels of Dumbledore's homosexuality. "Ms. Rowling may think of Dumbledore as gay," said ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist Edward Rothstein, "but there is no reason why anyone else should."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Fans Continue to Debate Rowling's Outing of Dumbledore|author=Kimberly Maul |year=2007|work=The Book Standard|url=http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664632|accessdate=2007-10-31|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071029170706/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664632 |archivedate = October 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> According to John Mark Reynolds, assistant professor of philosophy at [[Biola University]] and the founder of [[Torrey Honors Institute]], "there is just no way to know this <U+201C>fact<U+201D> about Dumbledore from the books.
