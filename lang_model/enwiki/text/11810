'''[[Alexander Litvinenko]]''' was a former officer of the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|Russian Federal Security Service]], FSB and KGB, who escaped prosecution in Russia and received [[political asylum]] in Great Britain. He authored two books, "''[[Blowing up Russia: Terror from within]]''" and "''[[Lubyanka Criminal Group]],''" where he accused the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|Russian secret services]] of staging [[Russian apartment bombings]] and [[Allegations of state terrorism by Russia|other terrorism acts]] to bring [[Vladimir Putin]] to power.

On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized. He died three weeks later, becoming the first confirmed victim of lethal [[Polonium|polonium-210]]-induced [[radiation poisoning|acute radiation syndrome]].<ref name="Muslim"/> According to doctors, "Litvinenko's murder represents an ominous landmark: the beginning of an era of [[nuclear terrorism]]".<ref> "Ushering in the era of nuclear terrorism", by Patterson, Andrew J.

Litvinenko's allegations about the misdeeds of the [[FSB (Russia)|Federal Security Service of Russia]] (FSB) and his public deathbed accusations that Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] was behind his unusual malady resulted in worldwide media coverage.<ref name="litvinenkoarticle">{{cite web

Subsequent investigations by British authorities into the circumstances of Litvinenko's death led to serious diplomatic difficulties between the British and Russian governments. Unofficially, British authorities asserted that "we are 100% sure who administered the poison, where and how". However they did not disclose their evidence in the interest of a future trial. The main suspect in the case, a former officer of the Russian [[Federal Protective Service of Russia|Federal Protective Service (FSO)]] [[Andrei Lugovoy]], remains in Russia. As a member of the [[Duma]], he now enjoys [[immunity from prosecution]]. Before the suspect was elected to the Duma, the British government tried to extradite him, but without success, as described below.

==Background==
{{main|Alexander Litvinenko}}
Alexander Litvinenko was a former officer of the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|Russian Federal Security service]] who escaped persecution in Russia and received a [[political asylum]] in Great Britain. In his books, "''[[Blowing up Russia: Terror from within]]''" and "''[[Lubyanka Criminal Group]]''", Litvinenko described [[Vladimir Putin]]'s rise to power as a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] organised by the FSB. He alleged a key element of FSB's strategy was to frighten Russians by [[Russian apartment bombings|bombing apartment buildings]] in Moscow and other Russian cities.<ref>[[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Hoover Institute]] scholar [[David Satter]] described this controversy in the [[United States House of Representatives]]: "With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For "Operation Successor" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September, 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution." [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SatterHouseTestimony2007.pdf]</ref> He accused Russian secret services of having also arranged [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] through their Chechen [[agent provocateur]], that they organized [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting]],<ref>{{cite web| title = Russia Denies Involvement in 1999 Armenian Parliament Shooting | publisher = | date = 12 May 2005| url = http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/05/12/russiaarmenia.shtml| accessdate = 25 March 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> and that terrorist [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] was under FSB control when he visited Russia in 1997.<ref> [http://cicentre.com/Documents/russia_islam_not_separate.html Russia and Islam are not Separate: Why Russia backs Al-Qaeda], by Konstantin Preobrazhensky. According to Preobrazhenskiy, "At that time, Litvinenko was the Head of the Subdivision for Internationally Wanted Terrorists of the First Department of the Operative-Inquiry Directorate of the FSB Anti-Terrorist Department. He was ordered to undertake the delicate mission of securing Al-Zawahiri from unintentional disclosure by the Russian police. Though Al-Zawahiri had been brought to Russia by the FSB using a false passport, it was still possible for the police to learn about his arrival and report to Moscow for verification. Such a process could disclose Al-Zawahiri as an FSB collaborator. In order to prevent this, Litvinenko visited a group of the highly placed police officers to notify them in advance." </ref> 

Just two weeks before his death Litvinenko accused Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] of ordering the assassination of [[Anna Politkovskaya]].<ref name="dissident"> [[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko.

==Illness and poisoning==
On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill. Earlier that day he had met two former [[KGB]] officers, [[Andrei Lugovoi]] and [[Dmitri Kovtun]]. Lugovoi is a former bodyguard of Russian ex-[[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Yegor Gaidar]] (also reportedly poisoned in November 2006) and former chief of security for the Russian TV channel [[Channel One (Russia)|ORT]].  Kovtun is now a businessman. Litvinenko had also had lunch at [[Itsu]], a [[sushi]] restaurant on [[Piccadilly]] in London, with an Italian acquaintance and self-proclaimed "[[nuclear waste]] expert", [[Mario Scaramella]], to whom he reportedly made allegations regarding [[Romano Prodi]]'s connections with the [[KGB]].<ref>{{cite web

=== The poison===
{{wikinews|Traces of radiation found where Litvinenko ate}}

Shortly after his death, the UK's [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA) stated tests had established  Litvinenko had significant amounts of the [[radionuclide]] [[Polonium|polonium-210]] (Chemical symbol: <sup>210</sup>Po) in his body. British and [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] sources both said the use of <sup>210</sup>Po as a poison has never been documented before, and this was probably the first time a person has been tested for the presence of <sup>210</sup>Po in his or her body. The poison was in Litvinenko's tea cup.<ref name="waiter"/> People who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.<ref name="HPA Press Release">

Polonium was identified only after Litvinenko's death, on 23 November. Doctors and [[Scotland Yard]] investigators could not detect polonium earlier because it does not emit [[gamma rays]], which are encountered with most [[radioactive]] [[isotopes]]. Unlike most common radiation sources, [[Polonium|polonium-210]] emits only [[alpha particle]]s that do not penetrate even a sheet of paper or the [[epidermis]] of human skin, thus being invisible to normal radiation detectors in this case. Hospitals only have equipment to detect gamma rays. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as [[ionizing radiation]] which can cause [[radiation damage]]. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if digested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon.<ref name="Bomb"> "Death of a Dissident", page 327 </ref> Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment only hours before his death<ref name="Bomb"/>

=== Po-210 concentration in the body of Litvinenko ===

The symptoms seen in Litvinenko appeared consistent with an administered activity of approximately 2&nbsp;G[[Becquerel|Bq]] (50&nbsp;mCi) which corresponds to about 10&nbsp;micrograms of <sup>210</sup>Po.  That is 200 times the [[LD50|median lethal dose]] of around 238&nbsp;<math>\mu</math>Ci or 50&nbsp;nanograms in the case of ingestion<ref>{{cite web

{{Quotation2|...this may be the time to say one or two things to the person responsible for my present condition.
	
You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price. You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed. You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilised value. You have shown yourself to be unworthy of your office, to be unworthy of the trust of civilised men and women. You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.
	 
May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.}}

Nick Priest, a nuclear scientist and expert on polonium who has worked at most of Russia's nuclear research facilities, says that although the execution of the plot was a "bout of stupidity", the choice of polonium was a "stroke of genius". He says: "the choice of poison was genius in that polonium, carried in a vial in water, can be carried in a pocket through airport screening devices without setting off any alarms", adding, "once administered, the polonium creates symptoms that don't suggest poison for days, allowing time for the perpetrator to make a getaway." Priest asserts that "whoever did it was probably not an expert in radiation protection, so they probably didn't realize how much contamination you can get just by opening the top (of the vial) and closing it again. With the right equipment, you can detect just one count per second".<ref>{{cite web | title = 'The sadistic poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko'

===Polonium trails===
Detectives traced three distinct polonium trails in and out of London. The trails were left by Litvinenko, [[Andrei Lugovoi]], [[Dmitry Kovtun]], and [[Mario Scaramella]]. The patterns and levels of radioactivity they left behind suggested that Litvinenko ingested polonium, whereas Logovoi and Kovtun handled them directly.<ref name="Death"/> The human body dilutes the polonium before excreting in sweat, which results in a reduced radioactivity level.
There are also traces of Po-210 found at "Hey Jo/Abracadabra" bar, "Dar Marrakesh" restaurant, and Lambeth-Mercedes taxi. Official British version gives no reasonable explanation of this traces.

According to the official version, the poisoning of Litvinenko took place at around 5 p.m. of 1 November in the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square. The bus he travelled in to the hotel had no signs of radioactivity - but large amounts had been detected at the hotel.<ref>{{cite news

  | accessdate = 19 December 2006 }}</ref> After the Millennium bar, Litvinenko stopped at the office of [[Boris Berezovsky]]. He used a fax machine, where the radioactivity was found later. At 6 p.m. [[Akhmed Zakayev]] picked Litvinenko up and brought him home to Muswell Hill. The amount of radioactivity left by Litvinenko in the car was so significant, the car was rendered unusable.<ref name="Death"/> Everything that he touched at home during next three days  was contaminated. His family was unable to return to the house even six months later.  His wife was tested positive for ingesting polonium but did not leave a secondary trail behind her. This suggested that anyone who left a trail could not have picked up the polonium from Litvinenko (possibly, including Lugovoy and Kovtun).<ref name="Death"/>

Besides Litvinenko, only three persons left the polonium trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun who were school friends and worked previously for Russian intelligence in the [[KGB]] and the [[GRU]] respectively, and Scaramella (who, unfortunately, never worked for [[KGB]], neither for [[GRU]]).<ref name="Death"/> These people handled the radioactive material directly and did not ingest it, because they left more significant traces of polonium than Litvinenko.<ref name="Death"/> 

Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium hotel bar twice, on 1 November (when the poisoning took place), and earlier, on 16 October.
Trails left by Lugovoy and Kovtun started on 16 October, in the same sushi bar where Litvinenko was poisoned later, but at a different table. It was assumed that their first meeting with Litvinenko was either a rehearsal of the future poisoning, or an unsuccessful attempt of the poisoning.<ref name="Death"/>  

Traces left by Lugovoy were also found in the office of Berezovsky that he visited on 31 October, a day before his second meeting with Litvinenko. Traces left by Kovtun were found in Hamburg, Germany. He left them on his way to London on 28 October-31.<ref name="Death"/> The traces were found in passenger jets<ref>{{cite web

On 2 March 2007 [[Paul Joyal]], a former director of security for the [[U.S. Senate]] intelligence committee, who the previous weekend alleged on national tele<U+00AD>vision that the Kremlin was involved in the poisoning of Litvinenko, was shot near his [[Maryland]] home. An [[FBI]] spokesman said the agency was "assisting" the police investigation into the shooting. Police would not confirm details of the shooting or of the condition of Mr Joyal, however, a person familiar with the case said he was in [[critical condition]] in hospital. It was reported that while there were no indications that the shooting was linked to the Litvinenko case, it is unusual for the FBI to get involved in a local shooting incident. A person familiar with the situation said [[NBC]] had hired bodyguards for some of the journalists involved in the programme.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/7af97578-c924-11db-9f7b-000b5df10621.html "Expert in Litvinenko death is shot"]Expert in Litvinenko death is shot, Demetri Sevastopulo, 4 March 2007</ref>

: "When I was delivering gin and tonic to the table, I was obstructed. I couldn't see what was happening, but it seemed very deliberate to create a distraction. It made it difficult to put the drink down."
: "It was the only moment when the situation seemed unfriendly and something went on at that point. I think the polonium was sprayed into the teapot. There was contamination found on the picture above where Mr Litvinenko had been sitting and all over the table, chair and floor, so it must have been a spray."
: "When I poured the remains of the teapot into the sink, the tea looked more yellow than usual and was thicker - it looked gooey." 
: "I scooped it out of the sink and threw it into the bin. I was so lucky I didn't put my fingers into my mouth, or scratch my eye as I could have got this poison inside me."<ref name="waiter">{{cite web

It is estimated that he suffered doses of 18 Gy to his bone mass, 520 Gy to the bone surface, 8 Gy to the liver and 1.6 Gy to the lungs; it is also claimed that a [[post mortem]] examination revealed no signs of [[cancer]] in his body.

===Suspicious deaths of people involved in Russian politics===
{{see also|List of journalists killed in Russia}}
Comparisons have been made to the alleged 2004 poisoning of [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (Ukraine and Russia have been separate states since 1991), the alleged 2003 poisoning of [[Yuri Shchekochikhin]] and the fatal 1978 poisoning of the journalist [[Georgi Markov]] by the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Committee for State Security]] (Russia and Bulgaria had never been parts of the same state). The incident with Litvinenko has also attracted comparisons to the poisoning by radioactive (unconfirmed) thallium of KGB defector [[Nikolay Khokhlov]] and journalist Shchekochikhin of ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' (the ''Novaya Gazeta'' interview with the former, coincidentally, prepared by Russian journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]], who was later found shot to death in her [[apartment building]]).<ref>{{ru icon}}{{cite web
