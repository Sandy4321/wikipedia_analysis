{{Campaignbox Somme 1916}}
The 1916 '''Battle of the Somme''' was one of the largest battles of the [[World War I|First World War]], with more than one million [[casualty (person)|casualties]].  The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] forces attempted to break through the [[Germany|German]] lines along a 25-mile (40&nbsp;km) front north and south of the [[River Somme]] in northern France.  One purpose of the battle was to draw German forces away from the [[battle of Verdun]]; however, by its end the losses on the Somme had exceeded those at Verdun.

The battle is best remembered for its first day, [[1 July]] [[1916]], on which the British suffered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead &mdash; the bloodiest day in the history of the [[British Army]].

As horrific as the battle of the Somme is in British & Commonwealth memory, it also had a staggering impact on the German army; one officer famously described it as "the muddy grave of the German field army".  By the end of the battle, the British had learnt many lessons in modern warfare while the Germans had suffered irreplaceable losses. British official historian Sir [[James Edmonds]] stated, "It is not too much to claim that the foundations of the final victory on the Western Front were laid by the Somme offensive of 1916."

For the first time the home front in Britain was exposed to the horrors of modern war with the release of the [[propaganda film]] ''[[The Battle of the Somme (film)|The Battle of the Somme]]'', which used actual footage from the first days of the battle.

==Prelude==
The Allied war strategy for 1916 was largely formulated during a conference at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] held between [[6 December]] and [[8 December]], [[1915]], when it was decided that for the next year, simultaneous offensives were to be mounted by the [[Russia]]ns in the East, the [[Italy|Italians]] (who by now joined the entente) in the Alps and the Anglo-French on the [[Western Front]], thereby assailing the [[Central Powers]] from all sides. 

In late December 1915, General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] had replaced General [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] as Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF).  Haig favoured a British offensive in [[Flanders]] &mdash; it was close to BEF supply routes via the [[English Channel|Channel]] ports and had a strategic goal of driving the Germans from the [[North Sea]] coast of [[Belgium]], from which their [[U-boat]]s were menacing Britain.  However, though there was no formal arrangement, the British were as yet the junior partner on the Western Front and had to comply with French policy.  In January 1916, the French commander, General [[Joseph Joffre]], had agreed to the BEF making their main effort in Flanders, but after further discussions in February, the decision was reached to mount a combined offensive where the French and British armies met astride the Somme River in [[Picardy]].

Plans for the joint offensive on the Somme had barely begun to take shape before the Germans launched the [[battle of Verdun]] on [[21 February]], [[1916]].  As the French committed themselves to defending Verdun, their capacity to carry out their role on the Somme disappeared, and the burden shifted to the British.  As the bloodbath at Verdun dragged on, the aim of the Somme offensive changed from delivering a decisive blow against Germany to relieving the pressure on the French army.

The original British regular army, six [[division (military)|division]]s strong at the start of the war, had been effectively wiped out by the battles of 1914 and 1915.  The bulk of the army was now made up of volunteers of the [[Territorial Force]] and [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener's]] [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]], which had begun forming in August 1914.  The expansion of the army demanded [[general]]s for the senior commands, so promotion came at a dizzying pace and did not always reflect competence or ability.  Haig himself had started the war as commander of [[British I Corps]] before commanding the [[British First Army]] and now the BEF, in effect an [[army group]], made up of four armies (soon to be five) of 60 divisions.

By mid-1916, the [[Fokker Scourge]] was over, and the [[Royal Flying Corps]] had achieved [[air supremacy]] over the Somme battlefield. On the Somme front, the RFC fielded 10 squadrons and 185 aircraft against a German strength of 129 aircraft.  The British pursued a vigorous offensive policy that enabled them to perform artillery observation, via aircraft or tethered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s, while preventing the Germans from doing the same.  It was not until September that the introduction of new aircraft would swing the balance in favour of the German Air Service once again.

==The first day on the Somme==
[[Image:Hawthorn Ridge mine 1 July 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Explosion of the [[Hawthorn Ridge mine]], 7.20am, [[1 July]], [[1916]]]]

:''Main article: [[First day on the Somme]]''

The first day of the battle was preceded by seven days of preliminary [[artillery]] bombardment in which the British fired over 1.5 million shells.  Ten [[mine (warfare)|mine]]s had also been dug beneath the German front-line trenches and strongpoints; the three largest mines contained about 20 [[Ton|tons]] (18&nbsp;tonnes) of explosives each.

The attack would be made by 13 British [[division (military)|division]]s (11 from the [[British Fourth Army|Fourth Army]] and two from the [[British Third Army|Third Army]]) north of the Somme river and six divisions of the [[French Sixth Army]] astride and south of the river.  They were opposed by the [[German Second Army]] of General [[Fritz von Below]].  The axis of the advance was centred on the [[Roman road]] that ran from [[Albert, France|Albert]] in the west to [[Bapaume]] 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) to the northeast.

Zero hour for the Battle of the Somme was 07:30 on [[1 July]], [[1916]].  Ten minutes prior to this, at 07:20, the mine beneath [[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt]] was detonated.  Eight minutes later, at 07:28, the remaining mines were exploded (except for the mine at [[Kasino Point]], which was late).  At zero hour there was a brief and unsettling silence as the artillery shifted their aim onto the next line of targets.  Then, in the words of [[poet]] [[John Masefield]]:

:''[T]he hand of time rested on the half-hour mark, and all along that old front line of the English there came a whistling and a crying.  The men of the first wave climbed up the parapets, in tumult, darkness, and the presence of death, and having done with all pleasant things, advanced across [[No Man's Land]] to begin the Battle of the Somme.'' (''[[The Old Front Line]]'', 1917)

The infantry were burdened with 70&nbsp;[[pound (weight)|lb]] (32&nbsp;kg) of equipment and in some cases had been instructed to form up into uniform waves and advance at a walking pace.  {{note|carriage}} Elsewhere units had crawled out in to no man's land early so that they could rush the front German trench as soon as the barrage lifted.  Despite the heavy bombardment, many of the German defenders had survived, protected in deep dugouts, and they were able to inflict a terrible toll on the vulnerable infantry.

[[Image:British plan Somme 1 July 1916.png|thumb|left|250px|British [[infantry]] attack plan for [[1 July]].  The only success came in the south at [[Mametz]] and [[Montauban-de-Picardie|Montauban]] and on the French sector.]]

North of the Albert-Bapaume road, the advance was almost a complete failure from the outset.  In a few places the attackers got into the German front line trench system or even the support line, but invariably their numbers were too few to withstand the German counter-attacks.  As the German defensive barrage descended on no man's land, it became impossible for reinforcements to get through or for reports to get back.

Communications were completely inadequate, and commanders were largely ignorant of the progress of the battle.  A mistaken report that the [[British 29th Division|29th Division]] had succeeded at [[Beaumont Hamel]] led to the reserve brigade being ordered forward in support.  The 1st [[Newfoundland Regiment]], the only non-British battalion participating on the British front on [[1 July]], was unable to reach the forward trenches so advanced from the reserve trench.  Most of the battalion was wiped out before it crossed the front line, and it suffered 91% casualties, the second worst battalion loss of the day.

British progress astride the Albert-Bapaume road was likewise a failure, despite the explosion of the two mines at [[La Boisselle]].  Here another tragic advance was made by the [[Tyneside Irish Brigade]] of the [[British 34th Division|34th Division]] which started nearly one [[mile]] from the German front line, in full view of the defenders' [[machine gun]]s, and was effectively wiped out before it reached its own friendly forward trench line. 

In the sector south of the road, the British and French divisions had greater success.  Here the German defences were relatively weak, and the French artillery, which was superior in numbers and experience to the British, was highly effective.  From the town of [[Montauban-de-Picardie|Montauban]] to the Somme river, all the first day objectives were reached.  South of the Somme, the French divisions even surpassed their intended objectives.

Some British divisions managed to perform extremely well; according to Middlebrook:

:''The leading battalions (of the 36th (Ulster) Division) had been ordered out from the wood just before 7.30 A.M. and laid down near the German trenches...At zero hour the British barrage lifted. Bugles blew the "Advance". Up sprang the Ulstermen and, without forming up in the waves adopted by other divisions, they rushed the German front line.....By a combination of sensible tactics and Irish dash, the prize that eluded so many, the capture of a long section of the German front line, had been accomplished. ''

And in another sector:

:''At Gommecourt...Attacking from the south, the 56th (London) Division had performed brilliantly. Making use of the new trench they had dug in No Man's Land and a smoke-screen, four battalions had captured the whole of the German front-line system. ''

Overall, however, the first day on the Somme was a failure.  The British had suffered 19,240 dead, 35,493 wounded, 2,152 missing and 585 prisoners for a total loss of 57,470.  Initial casualties were especially heavy among officers, who still dressed differently from [[non-commissioned officer]]s and other ranks, and whose uniforms the Germans had been trained to recognize.

An exact count of German casualties for [[1 July]] is difficult to make, because German units only submitted casualty returns every 10 days.  It is estimated that the Germans suffered 8,000 casualties on the British front of which 2,200 were [[prisoners of war]].  The disparity between British and German casualties was highest at [[Ovillers]], where the [[British 8th Division (World War I)|British 8th Division]] suffered 5,121 casualties while the defending German 180th Regiment had only 280 casualties &mdash; a ratio of 18 to 1.

==Aftermath of the first day==

[[Image:Somme battlefield aerial view July 1916.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An aerial view of the Somme battlefield in July, taken from a British [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] near [[B<U+00E9>court]].]]

At 22:00 on [[1 July]], the commander of the [[British Fourth Army]], Lieutenant-General [[Henry S. Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]], had issued orders for the attack to be resumed.  Confusion and poor communications through the extended chain of command meant it was some days before the British leaders realised the scale of the disaster.  Haig appointed Lieutenant-General [[Hubert Gough]] to take over the northern sector while the Fourth Army dealt with the southern sector.  Gough recognised the fiasco on his sector and prevented an immediate resumption of the offensive &mdash; operations would not resume until [[3 July]].

The British were also ignorant of opportunities that existed south of the Albert-Bapaume road where they had achieved partial success.  It is now known that there existed for a time a large gap in the German defences between Ovillers (on the road) and Longueval.  On [[3 July]] a [[reconnaissance]] patrol from the [[British 18th (Eastern) Division|18th (Eastern) Division]] ranged two miles into German territory without encountering an established defensive position.  However, the opportunity was missed or the British lacked the resources to exploit it, and the Germans were able to fill the gap in time.

[[Mametz Wood]] was still vacant on [[3 July]] but was reoccupied by the Germans the following day and would not be captured until [[10 July]] after two costly attempts.  Places such as [[High Wood]] and [[Delville Wood]], there for the taking in the aftermath of the first day, would require an enormous expenditure of lives before they were eventually captured in August and September.  In August Rawlinson wrote of the period 1&ndash;[[4 July]]:

:''These four days would in all probability have enabled us to gain full possession of the hostile third line of defence, which was at that time less than half finished... It makes me sick to think of the "might have beens"''.

For the first two weeks of July, the battle descended into a series of disjointed, small-scale actions, ostensibly in preparation for making a major push.  Between [[3 July]] and [[13 July]], Rawlinson's Fourth Army carried out 46 "actions" resulting in 25,000 casualties but no significant advance.  This demonstrated a difference in strategy between Haig and his French counterparts and was a source of friction.  Haig's purpose was to maintain continual pressure on the enemy while Joffre and Foch preferred to conserve their strength in preparation for a single, heavy blow.

In one significant respect, the Battle of the Somme was a major strategic success for the British as on [[12 July]], in response to the Somme fighting and the situation in the east, Falkenhayn called off the German offensive at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]].  While the fighting would continue there until December, it would be the French who dictated the course of the battle.

On the Somme, von Below's Second Army would not be able to endure the continued British and French pressure alone.  Each front line German division was being attacked by three or four Allied divisions.  On [[19 July]], the German forces were reorganised with von Below taking command of the [[German First Army]], responsible for the northern sector, and General [[Max von Gallwitz]] taking over the Second Army which covered the southern sector.  In addition, von Gallwitz was made [[army group]] commander responsible for both German armies on the Somme.

As early as [[2 July]], seven German divisions were on their way to the Somme as reinforcements, and seven more were on their way within another week.  In July and August the Germans poured in 35 extra divisions on the British sectors and a further seven divisions on the French sector.  The combined pressure on Germany meant that ''[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]'' (OHL, army high command) had only one division left in reserve by August.

The British had hoped to stem this flow of German reinforcements to the Somme from other sectors of the front.  To do this a series of raids and demonstrations were carried out with the aim of "pinning" the German divisions to the front.  The largest and most infamous of these was the [[Battle of Fromelles]], [[19 July|19]]&ndash;[[20 July]], opposite [[Aubers Ridge]] in [[Artois]].  For the cost of 7,080 [[Australia]]n and British casualties, no ground was captured and no halt was made to the withdrawal of German divisions from Artois to the Somme.

==Battle of Bazentin Ridge==
:''Main article: [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge]]''

On [[14 July]] ([[Bastille Day]]) the Fourth Army was finally ready to resume the offensive in the southern sector.  The attack, known as the [[battle of Bazentin Ridge]], was aimed at capturing the German second defensive position which ran along the crest of the ridge from [[Pozi<U+00E8>res]], on the Albert&ndash;Bapaume road, southeast towards the villages of [[Guillemont]] and [[Ginchy]].  The objectives were the villages of [[Bazentin le Petit]], [[Bazentin le Grand]] and [[Longueval]], which was adjacent to [[Delville Wood]].  Beyond this line, on the reverse slope of the ridge, lay [[High Wood]].

[[Image:Bazentin le Petit 14 July 1916 map.png|thumb|right|350px|The [[British 21st Division]] attack on [[Bazentin le Petit]], [[14 July]] [[1916]].  The area captured by 9.00 am is shown by the dashed red line.]]

There is considerable contrast between the preparation and execution of this attack and that of [[1 July]].  The attack on Bazentin Ridge was made by four divisions on a front of 6,000 yards with the troops going over before dawn at 03:25 after a surprise five minute artillery bombardment.  The artillery laid down a [[creeping barrage]], and the attacking waves pushed up close behind it in no man's land, leaving them only a short distance to cross when the barrage lifted from the Germans' front trench.

By mid-morning, the first phase of the attack was a success with nearly all objectives taken, and as on [[1 July]], a gap was made in the German defences.  However, again as on [[1 July]], the British were unable to successfully exploit it.  Their attempt to do so created the most famous [[cavalry]] action of the Battle of the Somme when the [[7th Dragoon Guards]] and the [[2nd Deccan Horse]] attempted to capture High Wood.  It is likely that the wood could have been captured by the infantry in the morning, but by the time the cavalry were in position to attack, the Germans had begun to recover.  Though the cavalry held on in the wood through the night of [[14 July]], they had to withdraw the following day.

The British had a foothold in High Wood and would continue to fight over it as well as Delville Wood, neighbouring Longueval, for many days.  Unfortunately for them, the successful opening of the [[14 July]] attack did not mean they had learnt how to conduct trench battles.  On the night of [[22 July|22]]&ndash;[[23 July]], Rawlinson launched an attack using six divisions along the length of the Fourth Army front which failed completely.  The Germans were learning; they had begun to move away from the trench-based defences and towards a flexible [[defence in depth]] system of strongpoints that was difficult for the supporting artillery to suppress.

==Pozi<U+00E8>res and Mouquet Farm==
:''Main articles: [[Battle of Pozi<U+00E8>res]] &ndash; [[Battle of Mouquet Farm]]''

No significant progress was made in the northern sector in the first few weeks of July.  Ovillers, just north of the Albert-Bapaume road, was not captured until [[16 July]].  Its capture, and the foothold the British had obtained in the German second position on 14 July, meant that the chance now existed for the German northern defences to be taken in the flank.  The key to this was [[Pozi<U+00E8>res]].

The village of Pozi<U+00E8>res lay on the Albert-Bapaume road at the crest of the ridge.  Just behind (east) the village ran the trenches of the German second position.  The Fourth Army made three attempts to seize the village between [[14 July]] and [[17 July]] before Haig relieved Rawlinson's army of responsibility for its northern flank.  The capture of Pozi<U+00E8>res became a task for Gough's [[British Reserve Army|Reserve Army]], and the tool he would use was the three [[Australia]]n divisions of [[I Anzac Corps]].

[[Image:Pozieres view north 28 August 1916.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Pozi<U+00E8>res looking north, [[28 August]].]]

Gough wanted the [[Australian 1st Division (World War I)|Australian 1st Division]] to attack immediately, but the division's British commander, [[Major General]] [[Harold Bridgwood Walker|Harold Walker]], refused to send his men in without adequate preparation.  The attack was scheduled for the night of [[23 July]] to coincide with the Fourth Army attack of [[22 July]] &ndash; [[23 July]].

Going in shortly after midnight, the attack on Pozi<U+00E8>res was a success, largely thanks to Walker's insistence on careful preparation and an overwhelming supporting bombardment; however, an attempt to capture the neighbouring German second position failed, though two Australians were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] in the attempt.  The Germans, recognising the critical importance of the village to their defensive network, made three unsuccessful counter-attacks before beginning a prolonged and methodical bombardment of the village.  The final German effort to reclaim Pozi<U+00E8>res came before dawn on [[7 August]] following a particularly heavy bombardment.  The Germans overran the forward Australian defences, and a wild m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e developed from which the Australians emerged victorious.

Gough planned to drive north along the ridge towards [[Mouquet Farm]], allowing him to threaten the German bastion of [[Thiepval]] from the rear.  However, the further the Australians advanced, the deeper was the [[salient (military)|salient]] they created such that the German artillery could concentrate on them from three directions.

[[Image:Pozieres plateau 28 August 1916.jpg|thumb|left|The plateau north and east of Pozi<U+00E8>res, [[28 August]].]]

On [[8 August]] the Australians began pushing north along the ridge with the [[British II Corps]] advancing from Ovillers on their left.  By [[10 August]] a line had been established just south of the farm, which the Germans had turned into a fortress with deep dugouts and tunnels connecting to distant redoubts.  The Australians made numerous attempts to capture the farm between [[12 August]] and [[3 September]], inching closer with each attempt; however, the German garrison held out.  The Australians were relieved by the [[Canadian Corps]], who would briefly capture Mouquet Farm on [[16 September]], the day after the next major British offensive.  The farm was finally overrun on [[26 September]], and the garrison surrendered the following day.

In the fighting at Pozi<U+00E8>res and Mouquet Farm, the three Australian divisions suffered over 23,000 casualties.  If the losses from [[Battle of Fromelles|Fromelles]] on [[19 July]] are included, Australia had sustained more casualties in six weeks in France than they had in the eight months of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]].

==Attrition: August and September==
:''Main articles: [[Battle of Guillemont]] &ndash; [[Battle of Ginchy]]''

[[Image:Wiltshire Regiment Thiepval 7 August 1916.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Men from [[The Wiltshire Regiment]] attacking near [[Thiepval]], [[7 August]].]]

By the start of August, Haig had accepted that the prospect of achieving a breakthrough was now unlikely; the Germans had "recovered to a great extent from the disorganisation" of July.  For the next six weeks, the British would engage in a series of small-scale actions in preparation for the next major push.  On [[29 August]] the German Chief of the General Staff, [[Erich Falkenhayn]], was replaced by General [[Paul von Hindenburg]], with General [[Erich Ludendorff]] as his deputy, but in effect the operational commander.  The immediate effect of this change was the introduction of a new defensive doctrine.  On [[23 September]] the Germans began constructing the ''Siegfried Stellung'', called the [[Hindenburg Line]] by the British.

On the Fourth Army's front, the struggle for [[High Wood]], [[Delville Wood]] and the [[Switch Line]] dragged on.  The boundary between the British and French armies lay southeast of Delville Wood, beyond the villages of [[Battle of Guillemont|Guillemont]] and [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]].  Here the British line had not progressed significantly since the first day of the battle, and the two armies were in [[echelon (military)|echelon]], making progress impossible until the villages were captured.  The first British effort to seize Guillemont on [[8 August]] was a debacle.  On [[18 August]], a larger effort began, involving three British corps as well as the French, but it took until [[3 September]] before Guillemont was in British hands.  Attention now turned to Ginchy, which was captured by the [[British 16th (Irish) Division|16th (Irish) Division]] on [[9 September]].  The French had also made progress, and once Ginchy fell, the two armies were linked near [[Combles]].

[[Image:German dead Guillemont September 1916.jpg|thumb|right|A demolished German trench and dugout near [[Guillemont]].]]

The British now had an almost straight front line from near Mouquet Farm in the northwest to Combles in the southeast, providing a suitable jumping-off position for another large scale attack.  In 1916, a straight front was considered necessary to enable the supporting artillery to lay down an effective creeping barrage behind which the infantry could advance.

This intermediate phase of the Battle of the Somme had been costly for the Fourth Army, despite there being no major offensive.  Between [[15 July]] and [[14 September]] (the eve of the next battle), the Fourth Army made around 90 attacks of [[battalion]] strength or more with only four being general attacks across the length of the army's 5 miles of front.  The result was 82,000 casualties and an advance of approximately 1,000 [[yard]]s&mdash;a performance even worse than [[1 July]].

==Tank!==
:''Main articles: [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] &ndash; [[Battle of Morval]]''

[[Image:British Mark I male tank Somme 25 September 1916.jpg|thumb|right|''C-15'', a British Mark I "male" [[tank]], [[25 September]] [[1916]].]]

The last great Allied effort to achieve a breakthrough came on [[15 September]] in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] with the initial advance made by 11 British divisions (nine from Fourth Army, two [[Canada|Canadian]] divisions on the Reserve Army sector) and a later attack by four French corps.

The battle is chiefly remembered today as the debut of the [[tank]].  The British had high hopes that this secret weapon would break the deadlock of the trenches.  Early tanks were not weapons of mobile warfare &mdash; with a top speed of 2&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (3.2&nbsp;km/h), they were easily outpaced by the [[infantry]] &mdash; but were designed for [[trench warfare]].  They were untroubled by [[barbed wire]] obstacles and impervious to [[rifle]] and [[machine gun]] fire, though highly vulnerable to artillery.  Additionally, the tanks were notoriously unreliable; of the 49 tanks available on [[15 September]], only 32 made it to the start line, and of these, only 21 made it into action.  Mechanical breakdowns were common, and many others became bogged or ditched in the shell holes and trenches of the churned battlefield.

[[Image:New Zealand trench Flers September 1916.jpg|thumb|left|[[New Zealand]] infantry in the [[Switch Line]].]]

The British made gains across the length of their front, the greatest being in the centre at [[Flers]] with an advance of 3,500 yards, a feat achieved by the newest British division in France, the [[British 41st Division|41st Division]], in their first action.  They were later joined by the tank ''D-17'',  giving rise to the optimistic press report: "A tank is walking up the High Street of Flers with the British Army cheering behind."

It was also the first major Western Front battle for the [[New Zealand Division]], at the time part of the [[British XV Corps]], which captured part of the [[Switch Line]] west of Flers.  On the left flank, the [[Canadian 2nd Division]] captured the village of [[Courcelette]] after heavy fighting, with some assistance from tanks.  And finally after two months of fighting, the British captured all of [[High Wood]], though not without another costly struggle.  The plan was to use tanks in support of infantry from the [[British 47th (1/2nd London) Division|47th (1/2nd London) Division]], but the wood was an impassable landscape of shattered stumps and shell holes, and only one tank managed to penetrate any distance.  The German defenders were forced to abandon High Wood once British progress on the flanks threatened to encircle them.

[[Image:British infantry Morval 25 September 1916.jpg|thumb|right|British infantry advancing near [[Ginchy]] during the [[Battle of Morval]], [[25 September]].]]

The British had managed to advance during Flers-Courcelette, capturing 4,500 yards of the German third position, but fell short of all their objectives, and once again the breakthrough eluded them.  The tank had shown promise, but its lack of reliability limited its impact, and the [[military tactic|tactics]] of tank warfare were obviously in their infancy.

The least successful sector on 15 September had been east of Ginchy where the [[Quadrilateral]] redoubt had held up the advance towards [[Morval]] &mdash; the Quadrilateral was not captured until [[18 September]].  Another attack was planned for [[25 September]] with the objectives of the villages of [[Gueudecourt]], [[Lesb<U+0153>ufs]] and Morval.  Like the [[14 July]] [[battle of Bazentin Ridge]], the limited objectives, concentrated artillery and weak German defences resulted in a successful attack.  On this occasion the tanks remained in reserve.

==The final phase==
:''Main articles: [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge]] &ndash; [[Battle of Le Transloy]] &ndash; [[Battle of the Ancre Heights]] &ndash; [[Battle of the Ancre]]''

[[Image:Stretcher bearers Battle of Thiepval Ridge September 1916.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stretcher bearers recovering wounded during the [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge]], September 1916.]]

On [[26 September]] Gough's Reserve Army launched its first major offensive since the opening day of the battle in an attempt to capture the German fortress of [[Thiepval]].  The [[British 18th (Eastern) Division|18th (Eastern) Division]], which had excelled on [[1 July]], once more demonstrated by capturing most of Thiepval on the first day that careful training, preparation and leadership could overcome the obstacles of trench warfare.  [[Mouquet Farm]] finally fell to the [[British 11th (Northern) Division|11th (Northern) Division]], and the Canadians advanced 1,000 yards (1&nbsp;km) from Courcelette.

There followed a period from [[1 October]] to [[11 November]], known as the [[Battle of the Ancre Heights]], of grinding attritional fighting for little gain.  At the end of October, Gough's army was renamed the [[British Fifth Army]].

Meanwhile on the Fourth Army's front, Haig was still under the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent.  On [[29 September]] he had outlined plans for [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby's]] [[British Third Army|Third Army]] to rejoin the battle in the north around Gommecourt and for the Fourth Army to attack towards [[Cambrai]].  The first step required the capture of the German Transloy Line, effectively the German fourth defensive position that ran from the village of [[Le Transloy]] in the east to [[Le Sars]] on the Albert-Bapaume road.

Opening on [[1 October]], the [[Battle of Le Transloy]] became bogged down as the weather broke, and heavy rain turned the churned battlefield into a quagmire.  Le Sars was captured on [[7 October]], but elsewhere there was little progress and a continual flow of casualties.  The final throe came on [[5 November]] with a failed attack on the [[Butte de Warlencourt]].  On the Fourth Army's front, major operations in the Battle of the Somme had now ceased.

The final act of the Battle of the Somme was played out between [[13 November|13]]&ndash;[[18 November]] along the [[Ancre River]], north of Thiepval.  Haig's purpose for the attack was more [[political]] than military &mdash; with winter setting in, there was no longer any prospect of a breakthrough.  Instead, with another conference at Chantilly starting on [[15 November]], he hoped to be able to report of success to his French counterparts.

The opening moves were almost a replay of [[1 July]], even down to another mine being detonated beneath [[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt]] west of [[Beaumont Hamel]].  The [[British 31st Division|31st Division]] had attacked [[Serre (Somme)|Serre]] on [[1 July]] and four and a half months later was called on to do it again; the results were similar.  South of Serre the British, with the benefit of their hard-earned experience, succeeded in capturing most of their objectives.  The [[British 51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Division]] took Beaumont Hamel while on their right the [[British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division|63rd (Royal Naval) Division]] captured [[Beaucourt]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Bernard Freyberg]] winning the [[Victoria Cross]] in the process.  South of the Ancre [[British II Corps|II Corps]] had also made progress.

Haig was satisfied with the result, but Gough argued for a final effort which was made on [[18 November]] with an attack on the Munich and Frankfurt Trenches and a push towards [[Grandcourt]].  Ninety men of the 16th Battalion, [[Highland Light Infantry]] (the "Glasgow Boys Brigade" [[Pals battalion]]) were cut-off in Frankfurt Trench where they held out until [[21 November]] when the 45 survivors &mdash; 30 of them wounded &mdash; surrendered.  So ended the [[Battle of the Ancre]] and with it the Battle of the Somme.

==Conclusion==

[[Image:Battle of the Somme 1916 map.png|thumb|right|300px|Progress of the Battle of the Somme between [[1 July]] and [[18 November]].]]

It is difficult to declare the Battle of the Somme a victory for either side.  The British and French did succeed in capturing ground but little more than 5&nbsp;miles (8&nbsp;km) at the deepest point of penetration, well short of their original objectives.  Taking a long-term view, the Battle of the Somme delivered more benefits for the British than it did for the Germans.  As British historian [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] said, "The battle of the Somme was not a victory in itself, but without it the [[Entente]] would not have emerged victorious in 1918."

===Strategic effects===

Prior to the battle, Germany had regarded Britain as a [[naval]] power and discounted her as a military force to be reckoned with, believing Germany's major enemies were France and Russia.  Starting with the Somme, Britain began to gain influence in the [[coalition]], especially following the [[mutiny|mutinies]] in the French army in 1917.  In recognition of the growing threat Britain posed, on [[31 January]] Germany adopted the policy of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in an attempt to starve the island nation of supplies, an act that would ultimately bring the [[United States]] into the war.

At the start of 1916, the British army had been a largely inexperienced mass of volunteers.  The Somme was the first real test of this newly raised "citizens army" that had come into being following [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener's]] call for recruits at the start of the war.  It is brutal but accurate to observe that many of the British soldiers killed on the Somme lacked experience, and therefore their loss was of little military significance.  However, they had been the first to volunteer and so were often the fittest, most enthusiastic and best educated of the citizen soldiers.  For Germany, which had entered the war with a trained force of regulars and reservists, each casualty was sapping the experience and effectiveness of the German army.  The senior German commander [[Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria]] stated, "What remained of the old first-class peace-trained German infantry had been expended on the battlefield."

The Battle of the Somme damaged the German Army beyond repair, after which it was never able to adequately replace its casualties with the same calibre of soldier that doggedly held its ground during most of the battle.  By the end of the battle, the British and German armies were closer to being equally matched; effectively [[militia]]s.

German commanders did not believe the army could endure continual [[battle of attrition|battles of attrition]] like the Somme.  On [[24 February]] [[1917]], the German army made a strategic [[scorched earth]] withdrawal from the Somme battlefield to the prepared fortifications of the [[Hindenburg Line]], thereby shortening the front line they had to occupy. In the grey area of gains and losses, it is therefore possible to claim that the Entente's territorial gain from the battle was greater than that which existed at the battle's close.

The strategic effects of the Battle of the Somme cannot obscure the fact that it was one of the most dreadful battles of the First World War.  A German officer, Friedrich Steinbrecher, wrote:

:''Somme.  The whole history of the world cannot contain a more ghastly word.''

===Tactical effects===
The Somme led directly to major new developments in Allied infantry organization and tactics; despite the terrible losses of 1 July, some divisions had managed to achieve their objectives with minimal casualties. In examining the reasons behind losses and successes on the first day of the battle, the British, and the Commonwealth contingents, reintroduced the concept of the infantry platoon, following in the footsteps of the French and German armies who were already groping their way towards the use of small tactical units. At the time of the Somme, British senior commanders insisted that the company (120 men) was the smallest unit of maneuver; less than a year later, the section of 10 men would be so. {{note|platoon}}

From ''When Your Numbers Up: The Canadian Soldier In The First World War'' by Desmond Morton:

<blockquote>In the months after the Somme, Canadian infantry battalions rediscovered platoons. Officially they had always been there: thirty or forty men...In practice, pre-1917 tactics and the lack of reliable, experienced offiers persuaded Canadian Expeditionary Force battalions to rely on companies....</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, instead of advancing as companies in line, as most troops had on the Somme, (General) Byng insisted that his battalions organize four platoons per company on a permanent basis, each with four sections...</blockquote>

<blockquote>A permanently constituted platoon with four specialized sections represented a fighting team that an officer might be able to control. Instead of companies advancing in line...attacking infantry could manoeuvre against an enemy post that held them up. An infantry company would have four teams, each capable of fighting its own small battle...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Byng's transformation of his corps's (sic) organization and tactics was hardly unique. By late 1914 the Germans were already feeling their way towards the all-arms teams they called Stosstruppen...So were some French divisions.</blockquote>

The Somme was proof that the British Army was going through a learning process. Drill and rote had been necessary to hammer together entire battalions of soldiers in the so-called "Kitchener's Army".  While 20,000 fatalities and 40,000 wounded men would be history's testament to their lack of military skill, there still existed amongst the piles of corpses the first glimmers of tactical and operational innovation. It should be noted that even successful battles such as the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], in which successful tactics and weapons pioneered after the Somme were employed (small unit tactics and wire-cutting shells chief among these), successful divisional operations were still costing thousands of friendly casualties. Successful battles in the First World War were only less tragic and costly in human terms by matter of degree.

The original Allied estimate of casualties on the Somme, made at the Chantilly conference on [[15 November]], was 485,000 British and French casualties versus 630,000 German.  These figures were used to support the argument that the Somme was a successful [[battle of attrition]] for the Allies.  However, there was considerable scepticism at the time of the accuracy of the counts.  When a final tally was compiled after the war, a count of 419,654 British and 204,253 French killed, wounded and prisoners was reached; a total loss of 623,907, of which 146,431 were killed or missing.

The British official historian Sir [[James Edmonds]] maintained that German losses were 680,000, but this figure has been discredited.  A separate statistical report by the British [[War Office]] concluded that German casualties on the British sector could be as low as 180,000 during the battle.  Today commonly accepted figures for all German losses on the Somme are between 465,000 and 600,000.  In compiling his [[biography]] of General [[Henry S. Rawlinson|Rawlinson]], Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice was supplied by the ''Reichsarchiv'' with a figure of 164,055 for the German killed or missing.

The average casualties per [[division (military)|division]] (consisting of circa 10,000 soldiers) on the British sector up until [[19 November]] was 8,026 &mdash; 6,329 for the four Canadian divisions, 7,408 for the [[New Zealand Division]], 8,133 for the 43 British divisions and 8,960 for the three Australian divisions.  The British daily loss rate during the Battle of the Somme was 2,943 men, which exceeded the loss rate during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] but was not as severe as the two months of the [[battle of Arras]] (4,076 per day) or the final [[Hundred Days (1918)|Hundred Days]] offensive in 1918 (3,685 per day).

The [[Royal Flying Corps]] lost 782 aircraft and 576 pilots during the battle.

==Notes==
{{ref|carriage}} Despite the concerns of some critics, there was military necessity for these orders. According to ''Mud, Blood and Poppycock'' by Gordon Corrigan (p.274):

:Critics of the Somme make much of what they see as insistence on parade ground precision, with men being ordered to walk and keep in line. This had nothing to do with ceremonial parades, but was a perfectly sensible rule to ensure that control was not lost, that men were not shot by their own side, and that they all arrived on the objective together and in a fit state to engage the enemy. Scorn is also poured on the need for the attacking infantry to carry packs weighing sixty pounds. This is one of the enduring myths of the First World War, and derives from an imperfect reading of Field Service Regulations. In fact, it was everything that the man carried and wore that weighed sixty pounds: the uniform he stood up in, the boots on his feet, his weapon and its ammunition. In the attack large packs were left behind, and the small pack contained only the essentials for the operation. That said, each man still had to carry his entrenching tool, extra rations, two gas helmets, wire cutters, 220 rounds of ammunition, two grenades and two sandbags, while ten picks and fifty shovels were taken by each leading company." This was no light burden, and the follow up troops, coming immediately after those who carried out the actual assault, carried a great deal more. It is one thing to capture ground, quite another to hold it. Once into a German position the objective had to be consolidated and held against the inevitable counter attack. This meant that the existing defence works had to be turned round to face the other way, wire obstacles had to be constructed and communications had to be established. Ammunition, grenades and digging implements had to be there, to say nothing of signals cable, water and food, and there was no other way of making all this immediately available to the infantry than by having them carry it with them.

It was in the aftermath of the Somme that the use of divisional insignia on tunic sleeves, backs and even on helmets became widespread, helping to ease the problem of command and control during a battle.
