'''Richard "Ricky" Powers''' (born November 30, 1970) is a former [[running back]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Cleveland Browns]], and a former [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] [[American football|football]] [[Captain (sports)|co-captain]]. In the NFL, he had a brief career with the Browns during their final season before they relocated to become the [[Baltimore Ravens]] after starring for the Wolverines. His career ended due to being lost in the shuffle when the Browns moved to Baltimore and changed coaching staffs.<ref name=EPhaB/> In college, he set the Michigan football freshman rushing record that stood 14 seasons, and as a sophomore was the leading rusher for the team during [[Desmond Howard]]'s [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning season.  At Michigan, he was a member of three consecutive [[Big Ten Conference]] football champions. In high school, he was the [[Parade All-American]] star running back of the two-time [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] (OHSAA) football championship team at [[Buchtel High School]], where he has returned to coach [[baseball]] and football.

==High school==
Powers was both born and raised in Akron, where he led the Buchtel High School football team to back-to-back OHSAA championships, as well as being named a high school All-American.<ref name=EPhaB/> Powers graduated from Buchtel in 1990 after leading them to the 1987 and 1988 Ohio Division II state high school championships.  As a sophomore in 1987, Powers rushed for 1,600&nbsp;yards including 600 in four playoff games and helped his coach earn [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]] Coach of the Year honors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB62861D4E02D38&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Flossie Named Top Summit Coach|accessdate=2008-12-15|date=1987-12-07|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|author=Paulk, Ralph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB6292EE70106AD&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Buchtel Is Among League's Powers|accessdate=2008-12-15|date=1988-08-30|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|author=Paulk, Ralph}}</ref> Powers rushed for 1,741&nbsp;yards and 28&nbsp;touchdowns as a junior,<ref name=BPBPoY/> including 289&nbsp;yards against [[Nordonia High School]] in a playoff game, and 2,014&nbsp;yards and 19&nbsp;touchdowns as a senior.<ref name=EPhaB>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6838|accessdate=2007-10-16|date=2007-05-31|publisher=Cleveland Browns |title=Ex-Brown Powers hired at Buchtel|author=King, Steve |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070711140110/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6838 |archivedate = July 11, 2007}}</ref>  During that junior season, he became the third junior (following [[Chris Spielman]] and [[Jeff Logan]], by one account and Spielman and [[Charles Gladman]] by another) to earn ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' Player of the Year honors.<ref name=BPBPoY>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB629856FDF89DE&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Buchtel's Powers BJ Player of Year|accessdate=2008-12-15|date=1988-08-30|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|author=Paulk, Ralph}}</ref><ref name=BPFRC/>  During the season, he topped his sophomore Championship game 161&nbsp;yard effort with a Championship game record 206&nbsp;rushing yard effort.<ref name=BPBPoY/>  He earned All-Ohio Division II honors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB6297F792E8CB7&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Buchtel Pair Honored Area Puts 5 on Div.

==Professional career==
In the NFL, Powers, who measured {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} and {{convert|213|lb|kg|1}}, was signed as a [[free agent]] in 1994 by the [[Detroit Lions]], but he was waived before the season started.<ref name=EPhaB/><ref name=DBS>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=POWERRIC01|publisher=databaseSports.com|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Ricky Powers}}</ref> He later that year signed with the Cleveland Browns, joining their practice squad. He remained on the practice squad until being promoted to the regular roster for the final three games of the [[1995 National Football League season]]. He totaled 51&nbsp;yards on 14 [[rush (American football)|rushes]], one six-yard [[reception (American football)|pass reception]], and three [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] returns for a total of 54&nbsp;yards. When the Browns relocated following the 1995 season to become the [[Baltimore Ravens]], and [[Ted Marchibroda]] replaced [[Bill Belichick]] as coach, Powers got lost in the shuffle. He dabbled with [[World League of American Football]] and [[Spring Football League]] afterwards, but soon retired.<ref name=EPhaB/>

In 2007, Powers assumed the football coaching duties at his high school alma mater, Akron Buchtel High School, where he has been the head baseball coach since 2004. At Buchtel, he inherits a football team that has a tradition of producing major college scholarship athletes and a few professional ones. Recent Buchtel Griffins who have become professional athletes include [[Antonio Pittman]], [[Charlton Keith]], and [[Ramon Walker]].<ref name=EPhaB/>  For 2007 and 2008, Buchtel competes in Ohio High School Athletic Association Division II, which is for schools with enrollments of between 365 to 523.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsaa.org/sports/ft/boys/ftregion.htm|title=2007 Football Regional: Breakdowns and Assignments |accessdate=2007-11-16|publisher=The Ohio High School Athletic Association}}</ref>  Buchtel has qualified for the state tournament 9 times in the past as both a Division II and Division III entrant,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/sports/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/119364697411920.xml&coll=2|title=Road to state finals carries 192 dreams|publisher=Cleveland Live, Inc.|work=Cleveland Plain Dealer|author=Fortuna, Bob|date=2007-10-29|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> but they were not among the 32 teams in the 120 team Division II class to qualify in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsaa.org/news/sports/102807_FT_1.pdf|title=OHIO HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION News Release|date=2007-10-28|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>

==Personal==
