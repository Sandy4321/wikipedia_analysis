'''St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog''' is a small medieval church, in [[Llandyfrydog]], [[Anglesey]], north Wales. The date of establishment of a church on this site is unknown, but one 19th-century Anglesey historian says that it was about 450. The oldest parts of the present building (such as the [[nave]] and the [[chancel]] arch) are dated to about 1400, with the chancel dating from the late 15th or early 16th century. It is built from rough, small, squared stones, dressed with limestone. One of the windows on the south side is raised to illuminate the pulpit, a decision that in the eyes of one 19th-century commentator "disfigures the building."<ref name=Jones/> 

According to local tradition, a standing stone about {{convert|1|mi}} away is the petrified remains of a man who stole a bible from the church and was punished by [[St Tyfrydog]] as a result. The Welsh historian [[Gerald of Wales]] said that when the Norman lord [[Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury|Hugh of Montgomery]] was putting down the Welsh revolt led by [[Gruffydd ap Cynan]] in 1098, he kept his dogs in the church, and they had gone mad by the morning. Montgomery himself was killed within a week <U+2013> taken as a sign of "divine vengeance".

The church is still in use for worship, as part of the [[Church in Wales]], as one of four churches in a combined parish. It is a [[listed building|Grade II* listed building]], a national designation given to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/upload/resourcepool/WhatIsListing_englishLR983.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> in particular because it is a "good Medieval rural church which retains much of its Medieval fabric".<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5360|title=Church of St Tyfrydog|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|date=2009|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> The circular churchyard walls and an 18th-century sundial in the churchyard have also been given listed building status.

The date of first construction of a Christian building upon this site is unknown. The 19th-century Welsh antiquarian [[Angharad Llwyd]] wrote in her ''History of the Island of Mona'' that a church was supposed to have been first built here around 450;<ref name=Llwyd>{{cite book|last=Llwyd|first=Angharad|authorlink=Angharad Llwyd |page=112|title=A History of the Island of Mona|origyear=1833|year=2007|publisher=Llyfrau Magma|location=[[Llansadwrn, Anglesey]]|isbn=1872773737}}</ref> [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], writing in 1849, said that the original church was established by [[St Tyfyrdog]] himself.<ref name=Lewis/> In his 1191 ''Itinerarium Cambriae'' ("Journey through Wales"),  [[Gerald of Wales]] mentioned the church, saying that when the Normans were ransacking Anglesey during a Welsh revolt led by [[Gruffydd ap Cynan]] in 1098, [[Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury|Hugh of Montgomery]], one of the Norman lords, had kept his dogs in Llandyfydog church.  He added that the dogs had gone mad by the morning, and the earl had been killed within a week <U+2013> taken as a sign of "divine vengeance", according to one modern historian.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Antony|title=Medieval Anglesey|pages=40<U+2013>42|chapter=The Age of the Princes|year=1982|location=[[Llangefni]]|publisher=Anglesey Antiquarian Society}}</ref> 

A church was recorded here in 1254 during the [[Norwich Taxation]], but the oldest part of the present building is the [[nave]] dating from about 1400.  The [[chancel]] was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century or in the first part of the following century.  Restoration work took place in 1823, and then again 1862, when the present porch (on the west end of the south wall) and the [[vestry]] (to the north) were added, along with other alterations.<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev/>

==Location==
The church is in a circular churchyard in the hamlet of Llandyfrydog,<ref name=List/> and is one of four in the parish of [[Amlwch]], the others being the churches of [[St Eleth's Church, Amlwch|St Eleth, Amlwch]], [[St Eilian's Church, Llaneilian|St Eilian, Llaneilian]], and [[St Gwenllwyfo's Church, Llanwenllwyfo|St Gwenllwyfo, Llanwenllwyfo]]. It is still used for services as part of the [[Church in Wales]].   The position of rector has been vacant since 26 July 2010. The parish is in the [[deanery]] of Twrcelyn, the [[archdeaconry]] of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor.<ref name=CinW>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/rb/ben.php?dosommat=detail&which=99 |title=Church in Wales: Benefices |accessdate=19 January 2011|publisher=[[Church in Wales]]}}</ref>

The village, which is about {{convert|6|mi}} from the county town of [[Llangefni]], takes its name from the church: the Welsh word "{{lang|cy|[[llan (placename element)|llan]]}}" originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", and "-dyfrydog" is a [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|modified form]] of the saint's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/religion.shtml|title=Religion and creed in place names|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=RC/> The church is set within a wooded churchyard in the middle of Llandyfrydog.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey/> An upright stone about {{convert|4|ft}} high, which stands in a field about {{convert|1|mi}} from the village, is known as "the thief of Dyfrydog".

St Tyfrydog's is built from rough, small, squared stones, dressed with limestone.<ref name=List/> The nave measures about 24&nbsp;feet 9&nbsp; inches by 23&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches (about 7.5&nbsp;m by 7.2&nbsp;m); the chancel is about 23&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches by 18&nbsp;feet 9&nbsp;inches (about 7.1&nbsp;m by 5.7&nbsp;m).<ref name=RC>{{cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|page=51|chapter=Llandyfrydog}}</ref> The roof is made of slate, with a stone [[bellcote]] at the west end housing one bell.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|page=75|isbn=1845270894|publisher=Carreg Gwalch|last=Jones|first=Geraint I.

The oldest window is to the east side of the porch, on the south wall, which dates from about 1400; it has two lights (sections of window separated by a [[mullion]]) topped by [[trefoil]]s, set in a rectangular window frame.  It is echoed by a 19th-century window on the same wall, set slightly higher to illuminate the pulpit.  The north wall has two rectangular windows, one with a pair of lights topped by [[cinquefoil]]s, the other a single light with a trefoil at the top.<ref name=List/> One of the windows has been inserted into a opening previously used as a doorway.<ref name=RC/> The east window, which has three lights, dates from the latter part of the 15th century, and is the only window to contain stained glass.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey/> Inside, the division between nave and chancel is marked with a pointed arch, dating from about 1400.<ref name=List/> Seating is provided in the form of painted [[box pews]], dating from the 19th century, and possibly installed at the time of the restoration work in 1823.<ref name=List/><ref name=Pev/>

A survey by the [[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]] in 1937 noted an 18th-century communion table, an engraved Elizabethan silver cup and a silver [[paten]] dated 1721, and a memorial inside the church dated 1791.<ref name=RC/> A 19th-century writer noted a seat near the altar with "R.B. 1630" upon it, said to mark it as belonging to the Bulkeley family (who were prominent and influential landowners, in Anglesey and elsewhere in north Wales, from the 15th to the 19th centuries).<ref name=Jones/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BULK-ELE-1400.html|title= Bulkeley family, Anglesey|work=[[Welsh Biography Online]]|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|date=2009|last=Richards|first=Thomas|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> The churchyard contains a number of slate tombs and a sundial made from brass, dating from the 18th century, standing in the base of a medieval stone cross.<ref name=List/><ref name=sundial/>

==Assessment==
The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* [[listed building]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 12 May 1970, being regarded "as a good Medieval rural church which retains much of its Medieval fabric". [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that the church still had "a rich vernacular character."<ref name=List/> The churchyard's stone wall and the sundial have both been given listed building status, at the lower level of Grade II (for "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them").<ref name=Cadwlist/><ref name=walls>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=24828|title=Churchyard wall at Church of St Tyfrydog|author=Cadw|publisher=Historic Wales|date=2009|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=sundial>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=24827|title=Sundial at Church of St Tyfrydog|author=Cadw|publisher=Historic Wales|date=2009|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref>

The 19th-century writer [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]] said that it was "a lofty and venerable structure, in excellent repair", and with "a remarkably large chancel."<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47847#s23|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales |year=1849|chapter=Llandyvrydog (Llan-Dyfrydog)|accessdate=2011|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Lewis (publisher)}}</ref> Writing in 1859, the clergyman and antiquarian [[Harry Longueville Jones]] said that the church was "one of the better sort" in Anglesey.<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|first=Harry|last=Longueville Jones|authorlink=Harry Longueville Jones|date=1859|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|volume=V|series=3rd|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|pages=174<U+2013>175|title=Mona Mediaeva No. XXIII|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam13assogoog#page/n187/mode/2up|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> At the time he saw the church, there was an old porch and the north door in the nave was still in use. He described the nave as "unusually high", and said that the window positioned to light the pulpit "disfigures the building."<ref name=Jones/> He also thought that the "high" chancel walls gave "great effect" to the interior.<ref name=Jones/> A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region described it as a "handsomely proportioned church"<ref name=Pev>{{cite book|title=The Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd|pages=151<U+2013>152|chapter=Anglesey|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=9780300141696|year=2009|last=Haslam|first=Richard|last2=Orbach|first2=Julian|last3=Voelcker|first3=Adam}}</ref> It particularly noted the nave, describing it as "broad, almost a square", with the chancel arch "dying into the responds."<ref name=Pev/>
