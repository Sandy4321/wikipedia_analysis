'''''Jem''''', also known as '''''Jem and the Holograms''''', is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] that ran from [[1985]] to [[1988]] in U.S. first-run [[television syndication|syndication]].  The show is about music company owner Jerrica Benton, her singer alter-ego Jem, her band the Holograms, and their adventures.<ref>{{cite news|title= Jem Is Rocking Fashion Doll Industry as She Battles Barbie for Top Spot |publisher= Los Angeles|date=1986-12-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-19/news/vw-3479_1|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=John | last=Swenson}}</ref>

The series was a joint collaboration by [[Hasbro]], [[Marvel Productions]] and [[Sunbow Productions]], the same team responsible for ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'' and ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|Transformers]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Barbie Takes Up Rock 'n' Roll to Match Rival Jem |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-10-06|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-06/business/fi-4330_1_barbies|accessdate=2011-08-29 | first=Lisa A. | last=Lapin}}</ref> The creator of the series was [[Christy Marx]], who also had been a staff writer for the aforementioned programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christymarx.com/writing.htm# |title=Christy Marx's Homepage |publisher=Christy Marx |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> The animation was provided by the [[Japan]]ese animation studio Toei Doga (now [[Toei Animation]]).<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090461/companycredits</ref> As of May 28, 2011, the show currently airs on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ward |first=Kate |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/04/28/jem-is-back-on-the-hub/ |title='Jem' is back, will be outrageous on The Hub |publisher=Popwatch.ew.com |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Hasbro]] hired advertising agency [[Griffin-Bacal Advertising]], the founders of [[Sunbow Productions]], to create the 65-episode animation series. Griffin-Bacal (Sunbow), as well as [[Marvel Productions]], had previously created the successful ''G.I. Joe'' series for [[Hasbro]]. ''G.I. Joe'' writer [[Christy Marx]] was hired to create the series based on the line of dolls and the original concept, which consisted of the two girl bands, Synergy, the boyfriend Rio, and the Rockin' Roadster. Marx created the full character biographies and relationships, including the love triangle aspect between Rio and Jerrica Benton/Jem, Starlight Music and Starlight House, the Starlight Girls, the villain [[Eric Raymond (Jem)|Eric Raymond]] and various secondary characters. Later, Marx was asked to develop new characters as they were introduced.<ref>http://www.loony-archivist.com/jem/primer/marx.htm</ref><ref>http://www.themarysue.com/interview-christy-marx-creator-of-jem-and-the-holograms/</ref> Marx wrote 22 of the 65 episodes. Other writers for the series included [[Cary Bates]], [[Greg Weisman]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Buzz Dixon]], [[Ellen Guon]], Steve Mitchell, [[Michael Reaves]], [[David Wise (writer)|David Wise]], [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Beth Bornstein]], [[Roger Slifer]], [[Richard Merwin]], [[Sandy Fries]], [[Cheri Wilkerson]], [[Misty Stewart-Taggart]], [[George Arthur Bloom]], [[Jina Bacarr]], [[Barbara Petty]], [[Chris Pelzer]], [[Michael Charles Hill]], [[Eric Early]], [[Clare Noto]], [[Carla Conway]], and [[Evelyn A. R. Gabai]].

The theme song [[JEM -Truly, Truly, Truly Outrageous]] with music and lyrics by [[Anne Bryant]], who also arranged and produced the tracks for the 165 song score, announced the opening and provided the closing to each show until late 1986, when [[Bryant's]] second theme, [[the JEM GIRLS]] became the song's closer. Lyrics for the shows feature songs were authored by veteran theatre lyricist [[Barry Harman]] and the music for the songs was composed by either [[Anne Bryant]] or her business partner, songwriter [[Ford Kinder]]. The show's format called for three, fully produced songs for the featured music videos in each episode.

[[New York's finest studio singers]], [[Ellen Bernfeld]], as Pizzazz, [[Britta Phillips]], as JEM, [[Gordon Grody]], as Riot,the lead singer of the [[Stingers]], along with [[Diva Gray]], [[Florence Warner]] and [[Angela Capelli]] were the voices of the pop, funk and punk electronica productions, supported by pianist [[Peter Phillips]] father of [[Britta Phillips]], and by guitarist [[Steve Bill]], bassist [[Tom Barney]] and set drummer and electronic drum programmer [[Tom Oldakowski]]. [[Anne Bryant]] who cast the singers and musicians, created a pure young pop sound for [[JEM and the Holograms]] supported by acoustic instruments. Her sound for [[Pizzazz and the Misfits]] was crafted as strictly electronic, other than the addition of guitars and an occasional sax solo, in order to create an identifiable punk electronica style in stark contrast to their rival singing groups. In season three, [[Bryant]] introduced the slower, smooth, sexy/funky groove for the third group that entered  the show, the [[Stingers]].

The Executive Producers were [[Joe Bacal]], [[Jay Bacal]], [[Tom Griffin (producer)|Tom Griffin]], and [[Margaret Loesch]].  The story editor was [[Roger Slifer]] and [[Christy Marx]] third season, and the voice director was industry veteran [[Wally Burr]]. The show's directors and supervising animators included many veterans of the [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] cartoon studio including [[Gerry Chiniquy]], John Gibbs, [[Norman McCabe|Norm McCabe]], [[Warren Batchelder]] and [[Tom Ray]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090461/fullcredits</ref>

==Plot==
The central "secret" of the series is that Jem, lead singer and frontwoman of the rock group Jem and The Holograms, is in fact the alter ego of Jerrica Benton, owner/manager of Starlight Music.  Jerrica adopts this [[persona]] with the help of a [[holography|holographic]] computer, known as Synergy, which was built by Jerrica's father to be "the ultimate audio-visual entertainment synthesizer" and is bequeathed to her after his passing.  Jerrica is able to command Synergy to project "the Jem hologram" over herself by means of the remote micro projectors in her earrings, thus disguising her features and clothing and enabling her to assume the Jem persona.  She does so to acquire money to support ''Starlight Music'' and the ''Starlight Foundation for Girls'', a foster program founded by her late mother Jacqui Benton. The band ''The Holograms'' consists of: Kimber Benton, Jerrica's younger sister, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]ist and main [[songwriter]] for the band; Aja Leith, [[guitar]]ist; and Shana Elmsford, who plays the synth [[drum]]s. Aja and Shana are also childhood friends and adopted [[foster care|foster]] sisters of Jerrica and Kimber. Shana briefly leaves the group to pursue a career in fashion, at which point a new character, Carmen "Raya" Alonso, is introduced as her replacement. When Shana returns, Raya remains the Holograms' drummer while Shana takes up the guitar. Only The Holograms are aware of Jem's secret identity and the existence of Synergy when the series begins.
[[File:Jerricajem.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.8|left|Jerrica Benton and her alter identity Jem have a similar appearance.]]

Episodes of the series frequently revolve around Jerrica's efforts to keep her two identities separate, protect Synergy from those who might exploit her, and support the twelve Starlight Girls who live with her and The Holograms. The Benton's childhood home (where the foster girls were previously housed) is accidentally burned down early in the series. However, Jem and The Holograms later win possession of the Starlight Mansion when they compete in the "Battle Of The Bands" as well as a movie contract offered spontaneously by movie producer Howard Sands (based on real-world director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]])

The Holograms have two rival bands, ''The Misfits'' (no relation to the [[horror punk]] band of [[The Misfits (band)|the same name]]) and ''The Stingers''. The Misfits are composed of petulant rich girl Pizzazz (Phyllis Gabor) and her cohorts: no-nonsense Roxy (Roxanne Pelligrini) and kind-hearted, sensitive [[keytar]] player Stormer (Mary Phillips) and later by the manipulative [[United Kingdom|British]] [[saxophone]] player Jetta (Sheila Burns). Most episodes of the series involve a plot by the Misfits to upstage Jem and the Holograms' latest glamorous escapade. This rivalry is encouraged and manipulated by their manager, the ruthless Eric Raymond (the once half-owner of Starlight Music who, during the series, plots constantly to be its owner again).

The Stingers appear at the start of the third season when they hit town and shake things up for both groups (even though they are later signed under contract to Eric Raymond and The Misfits). The Stingers are composed of egotistical lead singer Riot (Rory Llewelyn), guitarist/con artist Rapture (Phoebe Ashe), and keyboardist Minx (Ingrid Kruger).

In the final episode of the series, the Misfits and Jem declare a truce when Ba Nee, one of the most troubled foster girls in Starlight House, was claimed by her long-lost father found by Jem and The Holograms.
==Music==
The majority of ''Jem'' episodes contains 3 music videos where the style of the music reflected the bands attitude as portrayed in the show. ''Jem'' began airing 4 years after [[MTV]] started it's initial broadcast and the inclusion of music videos was considered radical at the time.<ref>Christy Marx. Audio commentary. Jem - The Complete 1st & 2nd Seasons. 1985. DVD. Rhino / Wea, 2004.</ref> No official ''Jem'' "Soundtrack" was ever released, however many of the songs from the first season were released on cassette with dolls or playsets.<ref>http://www.pranceatron.com/jem/jemtapes.htm</ref>

==Current status of franchise==
Christy Marx has long expressed a desire to make a modern day revival of the animated series, but stated in a 2004 interview that there are a great deal of complications concerning the rights to the ''Jem'' properties.

<blockquote>
"I would like to see that happen. I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but the whole rights situation for ''Jem'' is very, very complicated. Believe me, if there were a simple straightforward way to do it, it would be done. But there are some very big complications that are in the way at the moment." ''--Christy Marx.''<ref>{{cite web|author=LJC |url=http://www.loony-archivist.com/jem/primer/marx.htm |title=truly outrageous jem primer |publisher=Loony-archivist.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>

25 years after the ''Jem'' toy line was introduced to the U.S. market and 21 years after its demise, Hasbro has shown some legal activity in maintaining their trademarks and [[intellectual property]], leading some fans to believe they may be reviving the line via the trademark renewal for "Dolls, doll clothing and doll accessories; board games and jigsaw puzzles," "publications, namely coloring books, activity books, comic books, paperback and hard cover story books, story books and pre-recorded books on tape all sold as a unit, and magazines in the field of dolls and animated characters," and "Entertainment services, namely, production and distribution of movies and on-going animated television series." Since 2004, Hasbro has changed the registered Trademarks from "JEM," to "JEM & the Holograms," and "Jem and the Holograms." Hasbro has also registered 4 domain names that are Jem related: jerricabenton.com (which redirects to Hasbro's home page,) showtimesynergy.com, jemmovie.com, and jemandthehologramsmovie.com (these three do not redirect).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In September 2004, Cartoon Network Australia bought the TV rights to ''Jem'' and aired the show for ten months on their classics network, [[Boomerang (TV channel)#The Australian channel|Boomerang]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Forbes.com has reported that Hasbro has recently re-acquired distribution rights to the Sunbow library of Hasbro Classics, which includes ''Jem.'' This has led to speculation that ''Jem'' may be re-released on DVD in the future.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081204034709/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2008/05/14/afx5007719.html | work=Forbes | title=Hasbro reacquires distribution rights to Sunbow Library of Hasbro Classics - Forbes.com}}</ref>

Given the recent success of ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', [[Hasbro]] is said to be considering a live-action movie with Universal, with whom Hasbro signed a six-movie contract last year, or a new incarnation of the animated series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rowles |first=Dustin |url=http://www.pajiba.com/trade_news/jem-and-the-holograms-movie.php |title=Jem and the Holograms Coming to the Big Screen? |publisher=Pajiba.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>

On November 30, 2010 Hasbro added the trademarks Jerrica Benton, Kimber Benton, Aja Leith, Shana Elmsford, Rio Pacheco, and Minx for "G & S: Dolls, doll clothing and doll accessories; toy figures and playsets for use therewith." {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
