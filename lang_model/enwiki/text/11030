The '''Zaian''' (or '''Zayan''') '''War''' was fought between [[France]] and the [[Zaian confederation]] of [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes in [[Morocco]] between 1914 and 1921.  Morocco had become a French protectorate in 1912, and [[List of colonial heads of French Morocco|Resident General]] [[Louis-Hubert Lyautey]] sought to extend French influence eastwards through the [[Middle Atlas]] mountains towards [[French Algeria]].  This was opposed by the Zaians, led by [[Mouha ou Hammou Zayani]].  The war began well for the French, who quickly took the key towns of [[Taza]] and [[Kh<U+00E9>nifra]].  Despite the loss of their base at Kh<U+00E9>nifra, the Zaians inflicted heavy losses on the French, who responded by establishing ''groupes mobiles'', [[combined arms]] formations that mixed regular and irregular infantry, cavalry and artillery into a single force.

The outbreak of the [[First World War]] proved significant, with the withdrawal of troops for service in France compounded by the loss of more than 600 French killed at the [[Battle of El Herri]].  Lyautey reorganised his available forces into a "living barricade", consisting of outposts manned by his best troops protecting the perimeter of French territory with lower quality troops manning the rear-guard positions.  Over the next four years the French retained most of their territory despite intelligence and financial support provided by the [[Central Powers]] to the Zaian Confederation and continual raids and skirmishes reducing scarce French manpower.

After the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, significant forces of tribesmen remained opposed to French rule.  The French resumed their offensive in the Kh<U+00E9>nifra area in 1920, establishing a series of [[blockhouse]]s to limit the Zaians' freedom of movement. They opened negotiations with Hammou's sons, persuading three of them,  along with many of their followers, to submit to French rule.  A split in the Zaian Confederation between those who supported submission and those still opposed led to infighting and the death of Hammou in Spring 1921.  The French responded with a strong, three-pronged attack into the Middle Atlas that pacified the area.  Some tribesmen, led by [[Moha ou Said]], fled to the High Atlas and continued a guerrilla war against the French well into the 1930s.

The signing of the [[Treaty of Fez]] in 1912 established a French [[protectorate]] over [[Morocco]].<ref name="burke439">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=439}}.</ref>  The treaty had been prompted by the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, during which French and Spanish troops had been sent to Morocco to put down a rebellion against [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Sultan Abdelhafid]].  The [[French protectorate of Morocco|new French protectorate]] was led by a [[List of colonial heads of French Morocco|resident general]], [[Louis-Hubert Lyautey]], and adopted the traditional Moroccan way of governing through the tribal system.<ref name="burke439"/>  Upon taking up his post Lyautey replaced Abdelhafid with his brother, [[Yusef of Morocco|Yusef]].<ref name="Bimberg7">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=7}}.</ref>  The tribes took offence at this, installing their own Sultan, [[Ahmed al-Hiba]], in [[Marrakesh]] and taking eight Europeans captive.<ref name="Bimberg7"/>  Lyautey acted quickly against the revolt, dispatching General [[Charles Mangin]] and 5,000 troops to retake the town.  Mangin's men were highly successful, rescuing the captives and inflicting heavy casualties on vastly superior numbers of tribesmen for the loss of two men killed and 23 wounded.<ref name="Bimberg7"/>  Al-Hiba escaped to the Atlas mountains with a small number of his followers and opposed French rule until his death in 1919.<ref name="katz253">{{Harvnb|Katz|2006|p=253}}.</ref>

A popular idea among the public in France was to possess an unbroken stretch of territory from [[Tunis]] to the Atlantic Ocean, including expansion into the "[[Taza]] corridor" in the Moroccan interior.<ref name="Gershovich100">{{Harvnb|Gershovich|2005|p=100}}.</ref>  Lyautey was in favour of this and advocated French occupation of the [[Middle Atlas]] mountains near Taza, through peaceful means where possible.<ref name="Bimberg9">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=9}}.</ref>  This French expansion into the Middle Atlas was strongly opposed by the "powerful Berber trinity" of [[Mouha ou Hammou Zayani]], leader of the [[Zaian Confederation]]; [[Moha ou Said]], leader of the [[A<U+00EF>t Ouirra]]; and [[Ali Amhaouch]], a religious leader of the [[Darqawa]] variant of [[Islam]] prevalent in the region.<ref name="hois63">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=63}}.</ref><ref name="camb290">{{Harvnb|Fage|Roberts|Oliver|1986|p=290}}.</ref>

Hammou commanded between 4,000 and 4,200 tents{{#tag:ref|A tent is the traditional unit of measure for Berber tribes and holds approximately five persons.<ref name="trout78">{{Harvnb|Trout|1969|p=78}}.</ref>|name="tent"|group=nb}} of people and had led the Zaians since 1877, opposing the French since the start of their involvement in Morocco.<ref name="hois65">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=65}}.</ref>  An enemy of the French following their deposing of Sultan Abdelhafid, who was married to Hammou's daughter, he had declared a [[Religious war|holy war]] against them and intensified his tribe's attacks on pro-French (or "submitted") tribes and military convoys.<ref name="hois65"/><ref name="slavin119">{{Harvnb|Slavin|2001|p=119}}.</ref>  Said was an old man, who was held in good standing by tribesmen across the region and had formerly been a [[Qaid|ca<U+00EF>d]] (a local governor with almost absolute power) for the Moroccan government, even serving in the army of Sultan [[Abdelaziz of Morocco|Abdelaziz]] against a pretender at Taza in 1902.<ref name="hois59">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=59}}.</ref><ref name="singer196">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=196}}.</ref><ref name="bidwell75">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1973|p=75}}.</ref>  Despite initially being open to negotiations with the French, pressure from pro-war chiefs and the fear of ridicule from his tribesmen had dissuaded him.<ref name="hois59"/><ref name="singer197">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=197}}.</ref><ref name="bidwell34">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1973|p=34}}.</ref>  Amhaouch was a strong and influential man, described by French officer and explorer [[Ren<U+00E9> de Segonzac]] as one of the "great spiritual leaders of Morocco" and the "most powerful religious personality of the south east".<ref name="hois63"/>  The French had attempted to persuade the Zaians to submit since 1913 with little success; most tribes in the confederation remained opposed to French rule.<ref name="Gershovich101">{{Harvnb|Gershovich|2005|p=101}}.</ref>

Lyautey's plans for taking Taza also extended to capturing [[Kh<U+00E9>nifra]], Hammou's headquarters.  He had been advised by his political officer, [[Maurice Le Glay]] that doing so would "finish him off definitively" and cut the Zaians off from support of other tribes.<ref name="hois63"/>  The French outpost at nearby [[Kasba Tadla|Kasbah Tadla]] had recently been attacked by Said and subsequent peace negotiations led by Lyautey's head of intelligence, Colonel [[Henri Simon]], had achieved little.<ref name="Bimberg8">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=8}}.</ref>  As a result Mangin was authorised to lead a retaliatory raid to Said's camp at [[El Ksiba]] but, despite inflicting heavy casualties, was forced to withdraw with the loss of 60 killed, 150 wounded and much equipment abandoned.<ref name="Bimberg8"/>  Having failed to make any impression on the Zaians through negotiation in May 1914, Lyautey authorised General [[Paul Prosper Henrys]] to take command of all French troops in the area and launch an attack on Taza and Kh<U+00E9>nifra.<ref name="hois65"/><ref name="Bimberg9"/>  Henrys captured Taza within a few days using units drawn from garrisons in Fez, [[Meknes]], Rabat and Marrakesh and then turned his attention to Kh<U+00E9>nifra.<ref name="Gershovich101"/><ref name="hois64">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=64}}.</ref>

Henrys planned his assault on Kh<U+00E9>nifra to begin on 10 June 1914 with the dispatch of three columns of troops, totalling 14,000 men equipped with  wireless radios and supported by [[reconnaissance aircraft]].<ref name="Bimberg9"/>  One column was to set out from Meknes under the command of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Henri Claudel]], another from Rabat under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Gaston Cros]] and the third from Kasbah Tadla under [[Colonel]] [[No<U+00EB>l Garnier-Duplessix]].<ref name="hois66">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=66}}.</ref>  Henrys took overall command, directing the forces from an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]] within the Claudel column.<ref name="hois66"/>  Aware that he knew little of the terrain or the allegiance of local tribes Henrys offered a generous set of terms for tribesmen who submitted to French rule: they would have to surrender only their rapid firing rifles and any captured French supplies, and pay a small tax in return for protection.<ref name="hois66"/>  He also set aside substantial funds to bribe informants and tribal leaders.<ref name="hois66"/>

Despite these measures, Claudel's column came under attack before it even left Meknes, although it was the largest and intended as a diversion.<ref name="hois67">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=67}}.</ref>  Hammou's forces attacked their camp on three separate nights, inflicting losses of at least one officer and four men killed and 19 injured, but leaving the other two columns unopposed.<ref name="hois67"/>  Claudel launched a counterattack on 10 June while Hammou was preparing a fourth attack, sweeping the Zaians away with artillery and ensuring little resistance for his march to Kh<U+00E9>nifra on the next day.<ref name="hois67"/>  After enduring some sniping attacks in Teguet, Claudel's cavalry crossed the [[Oum Er-Rbia River|Oum er Rbia]] at [[el Bordj, Morocco|el Bordj]] and advanced to the outskirts of Kh<U+00E9>nifra.<ref name="hois67"/>  The rest of the column joined them on 12 June, fighting off Zaian attacks on the way and meeting up with the other two columns, finding the town emptied of people and raising the French flag.<ref name="hois67"/>  The column had lost two men killed in the march.<ref name="hois67"/>

The columns experienced repeated, strong attacks by Zaian tribesmen that day, repelled by late afternoon at the cost of five men killed and 19 wounded.<ref name="hois67"/>  Further attacks on the nights of 14 and 15 June were repulsed by artillery and machine gun fire, directed by searchlights.<ref name="hois69">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=69}}.</ref>  Henrys then dispatched two columns south to the Zaian stronghold of [[Adersan]] to burn houses, proving his military abilities but not provoking a decisive confrontation with the tribes, who returned to guerrilla warfare tactics.<ref name="hois69"/>  In response all French-controlled markets were closed to the Zaians and their trade convoys were intercepted.<ref name="hois69"/>

Henrys became aware of a Zaian presence at el Bordj and sent a column to attack them on 31 June.  South of el Bordj the French came under heavy fire from tribesmen with modern rifles and resorted to [[bayonet charge]]s to clear the way.<ref name="hois69"/>  The encounter was Henrys' first major engagement with the Zaians and his losses were high, one officer and 16 men killed and a further two officers and 75 men wounded.<ref name="hois70">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=70}}.</ref>  Zaian losses were much higher: the French counted at least 140 dead remaining on the battlefield, and considered the battle a victory.<ref name="hois70"/>  Henrys expected a pause in activity while the Zaians recovered, but instead Hammou stepped up attacks on the French.<ref name="hois70"/>  Just four days later an attack on a French convoy by 500 mounted tribesmen was only repulsed after several hours by more bayonet charges.<ref name="hois70"/>  French losses were again significant with one officer and ten men killed and thirty men wounded.<ref name="hois70"/>

===''Groupes mobiles''===
[[File:Senegalese troops en route to Morocco 1908.png|thumb|A near-contemporary depiction of Senegalese troops en route to Morocco|alt=A painting of a column of black soldiers and porters accompanied by a white French officer]]
In light of the increased attacks in the Kh<U+00E9>nifra area Henrys established three ''groupes mobiles'', made up of troops mostly drawn from the [[Army of Africa (France)|Army of Africa]].<ref name="Bimberg10">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=10}}.</ref>  Each ''groupe'' was designed to be highly mobile and typically consisted of several [[battalion]]s of regular infantry (Algerian and Senegalese [[Tirailleur]]s or [[French Foreign Legion]] troops), a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of cavalry (Algerian [[Spahi]]s), a few [[Artillery battery|batteries]] of artillery ([[field artillery|field]] or [[mountain artillery|mountain]]), a [[Section (military unit)|section]] of [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss machine gun]]s and a mule train for supplies under the overall leadership of a French senior officer.<ref name="Bimberg7"/><ref name="Bimberg5">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=5}}.</ref>  In addition each ''groupe mobile'' would have one or two ''goums'' (informal groups of around 200 men) of ''[[Moroccan Goumier|goumiers]]'', [[Irregular military|irregular tribal auxiliaries]], under the leadership of a French intelligence officer.<ref name="Bimberg6">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=6}}.</ref>  The ''goums'' were used for intelligence gathering operations and in areas of difficult terrain.<ref name="Bimberg6"/>

A four-battalion strong ''groupe mobile'' was established at Kh<U+00E9>nifra, under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Ren<U+00E9> Laverdure]]; one based to the west under Claudel and one to the east under Garnier-Duplessix.<ref name="hois70"/>  In addition fortified posts were established at [[M'Rirt]] and [[Sidi Lamine]] with the areas between patrolled by ''goumiers'' to protect convoys and submitted tribes from attack.<ref name="Bimberg10"/>  Increasing attacks on Kh<U+00E9>nifra throughout July, repelled only by concentrated artillery and machine gun fire, left Henrys concerned that a combined force of tribesmen could threaten the town and the submitted tribes.<ref name="hois72">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=72}}.</ref>  This fear was partially allayed by the separate defeats of Hammou and Amhaouch by the ''groupes mobiles'' of Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix and by increasing numbers of auxiliaries becoming available from newly submitted tribes through the [[Conscription|levy]] system.<ref name="Bimberg10"/>

Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix were ordered to patrol the French bank of the Oum er Rbia and attempt to separate the Zaians from the [[Chleuh]] to the south while Henrys planned for an advance through the Middle Atlas to the [[Guigou River]].<ref name="hois73">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=73}}.</ref>  These operations were halted by the reduction in forces imposed on him by the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in Europe.<ref name="hois73"/>

==First World War==
Lyautey received orders from Army headquarters in Paris on 28 July 1914 the day the First World War began, requesting the dispatch of all available troops to France in anticipation of a [[Schlieffen Plan|German invasion]] and the withdrawal of his remaining forces to more defensible coastal enclaves.<ref name="burke441">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=441}}.</ref>  The French government justified this stance by stating that the "fate of Morocco will be determined in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]".<ref name="Gershovich102">{{Harvnb|Gershovich|2005|p=102}}.</ref>  Lyautey, who had lost most of his own possessions when his house in [[Cr<U+00E9>vic]] had been burnt to the ground by [[Battle of Lorraine|advancing German forces]], was keen to support the defence of France and within a month had sent 37 infantry and cavalry battalions and six artillery batteries to the [[Western Front]] <U+2013> more than had been requested of him.<ref name="burke441"/><ref name="singer210">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=210}}.</ref>  A further 35,000 Moroccan labourers were recruited by Lyautey over the course of the war for service in France.<ref name="dehaas45">{{Harvnb|De Haas|2007|p=45}}.</ref>

Nevertheless, Lyautey did not wish to abandon the inland territory his men had fought so hard for, stating that if he withdrew "such a shock would result immediately all over Morocco&nbsp;... that a general revolt would arise under our feet, on all our points".<ref name="burke441"/>  Left with just 20 battalions of legionnaires (mainly German and Austrian{{#tag:ref|The French did not expect men of the foreign legion to have to fight against their own countrymen and so Germans and Austrians, who made up 12% of the total strength of the unit in the war years, were kept away from the western front, with most serving out the war in North Africa.<ref name="windrow424">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=424}}.</ref>|name="fflwar"|group=nb}} ), military criminals of the [[Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa|Infanterie L<U+00E9>g<U+00E8>re d'Afrique]], [[Military reserve forces of France|territorial reservists]], [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] and ''goumiers'', he switched from the offensive to a long term strategy of "active defence".<ref name="Gershovich102"/><ref name="osprey10">{{Harvnb|Windrow|Chappell|1999|p=10}}.</ref>  Lyautey withdrew all non-essential personnel from his rear garrisons, brought in elderly reservists from France and issued weapons and elements of military dress to civilians in an attempt to convince the tribes that the French army in Morocco was as strong as before.<ref name="Gershovich102"/><ref name="windrow423">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=423}}.</ref>  Lyautey referred to this move as similar to hollowing out a lobster while leaving the shell intact.<ref name="hois73"/> His plan depended on holding a "living barricade" of French outposts running from Taza in the north through Khenifra, Kasbah Tadla and Marrakesh to Agadir on the Atlantic coast.<ref name="hois73"/>

Lyautey and Henrys intended to hold the Berbers in their current positions until they had sufficient resources to return to the offensive.<ref name="hois70"/>  The recent French advances and troop withdrawals had left Kh<U+00E9>nifra badly exposed and from 4 August <U+2013> the day two battalions of infantry left the garrison for France <U+2013> the Zaian tribes launched a month-long attack on the town, supply convoys and withdrawing French troops "without interruption".<ref name="Gershovich101"/><ref name="hois73"/>  Lyautey was determined to hold Kh<U+00E9>nifra to use as a bridgehead for further expansion of French territory and referred to it as a bastion against the "hostile Berber masses" upon which the "maintenance of [his] occupation" depended.<ref name="Gershovich101"/>  Attacks on Kh<U+00E9>nifra threatened the vital communication corridor between French forces in Morocco and those in Algeria.<ref name="Gershovich101"/>  To relieve pressure on the town, Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix's ''groupes mobiles'' engaged Hammou and Amhaouch's forces at [[Mahajibat]], [[Bou Moussa]] and [[Bou Arar]] on 19, 20 and 21 August, inflicting "considerable losses".<ref name="hois73"/>  This, combined with the reinforcement of Khenifra on 1 September, led to reduced attacks, decreasing to a state of "armed peace" by November.<ref name="hois73"/>

[[File:German POWs in morocco WWI.jpg|thumb|German prisoners of war at work in Morocco|alt=A party of German prisoners works the ground with picks under the supervision of a French guards]]
Henrys began to move towards a more offensive posture, ordering mobile columns to circulate through the Middle Atlas and mounted companies to patrol the plains.<ref name="osprey10"/>  This was part of his plan to maintain pressure on Hammou, who he considered to be the linchpin of the "artificial" Zaian Confederation and responsible for their continued resistance.<ref name="hois70"/><ref name="hois71">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=71}}.</ref>  Henrys was counting on the onset of winter to force the Zaians from the mountains to their lowland pastures where they could be confronted or persuaded to surrender.<ref name="hois71"/>  In some cases the war assisted Lyautey, allowing him a freer hand in his overall strategy, greater access to finance and the use of at least 8,000 German [[prisoners of war]] to construct essential infrastructure.<ref name="singer205">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=205}}.</ref><ref name="jones111">{{Harvnb|Jones|2011|p=111}}.</ref>  In addition the increased national pride led many middle-aged French immigrants in Morocco to enlist in the army and, though they were of poor fighting quality, Lyautey was able to use these men to maintain the appearance of a large force under his command.<ref name="singer204">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=204}}.</ref>

The loss of the column at El Herri, the bloodiest defeat of a French force in Morocco, left Kh<U+00E9>nifra almost undefended.<ref name="jaques330">{{Harvnb|Jaques|2007a|p=330}}.</ref>  The senior garrison officer, Captain Pierre Kroll, had just three companies of men to protect the town.<ref name="Bimberg11"/><ref name="hois75"/>  He managed to inform Lyautey and Henrys of the situation by telegraph before the town came under siege from the Zaians.<ref name="Bimberg11"/><ref name="Gershovich103"/>  Henrys determined to act quickly against the Zaians to prevent Laverdure's deate from jeopardising the French presence in Morocco, dispatching Garnier-Duplessix's ''groupe mobile'' to Kh<U+00E9>nifra and forming another ''groupe'' in support at [[Ito, Morocco|Ito]] under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Joseph D<U+00E9>rigoin]].<ref name="Bimberg11"/><ref name="hois75"/>  Garnier-Duplessix fought his way to the town, relieved it on 16 November, and was joined by Henrys shortly afterwards.<ref name="hois76"/> The 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion Regiment also reached the town, having fought off Zaian attacks during their march from M'Rirt.<ref name="osprey10"/>  Henrys led excursions from Kh<U+00E9>nifra to El Herri as a show of force and to bury their dead, some of whom had been taken as trophies by Hammou to encourage support from other tribes.<ref name="hois76"/><ref name="Lazaro98"/>

The Zaian victory at El Herri, combined with slow French progress on the Western Front and the siding of the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire]] with the [[Central Powers]], led to an increase in recruits for the tribes and greater co-operation between Hammou, Amhaouch and Said.<ref name="hois80">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=80}}.</ref>  To counter this Henrys undertook a reorganisation of his forces, forming three military districts centred on Fez, Meknes and Tadla-Zaian (the Kh<U+00E9>nifra region), the latter under the command of Garnier-Duplessix.<ref name="hois80"/>  Henrys aimed to maintain pressure on Hammou through an economic blockade and the closure of markets to unsubmitted tribes.<ref name="hois80"/>  He imposed a war penalty, in the form of money, horses and rifles, on submitting tribes, believing that their submission would last only if they paid for it.<ref name="hois81">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=81}}.</ref>  Few tribes took up Henrys' offer and the Zaians continued to cross the Rbia and attack French patrols.<ref name="hois81"/>

The French returned to the offensive in March with D<U+00E9>rigoin's group sweeping along the French bank of the Rbia, north of Kh<U+00E9>nifra, and Garnier-Duplessix the left.<ref name="hois81"/>  D<U+00E9>rigoin faced and drove off only a small Zaian force, but Garnier-Duplessix faced a more significant force <U+2013> his troops were almost overrun by a large mounted group but managed to repulse them, inflicting "serious losses" in return for French casualties of one man killed and eight wounded.<ref name="hois81"/>  Garnier-Duplessix crossed the Rbia again in May to confiscate crops, and was attacked there by a force of 4<U+2013>5,000 tribesmen at [[Sidi Sliman]], near Kasbah Tadla.<ref name="hois82">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=82}}.</ref><ref name="jaques941">{{Harvnb|Jaques|2007c|p=941}}.</ref>  He repulsed them with artillery and counterattacked successfully over the course of a two-day engagement, killing 300 of the attackers and wounding 400 at the cost of three French dead and five wounded.<ref name="hois82"/><ref name="jaques941"/>  This victory restored the image of French superiority and led to an increase in tribal submissions, the withdrawal of Said's forces further into the mountains and a six-month period of relative peace.<ref name="hois82"/>  In recognition of this Garnier-Duplessix was promoted to major-general.<ref name="hois82"/>

The peace was broken on 11 November 1915 by an attack on a supply convoy headed for Kh<U+00E9>nifra by 1,200<U+2013>1,500 Zaians and allied tribesmen.<ref name="hois82"/>  The Moroccans pressed to within {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=off}} of the French, and Garnier-Duplessix, in command of the convoy, was forced to resort to the bayonet to push them back.<ref name="hois82"/>  French casualties amounted to just three killed and 22 wounded but Henrys was concerned by the influence that Hammou continued to hold over other Berber tribes.<ref name="hois82"/>  In retaliation Henrys took both ''groupes mobiles'' across the Rbia and bombarded the Zaian camp, inflicting casualties but making little impression on their will to fight.<ref name="hois83">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=83}}.</ref>  The Zaians recrossed the Rbia in January 1916, camping in French territory and raiding the submitted tribes.<ref name="hois83"/>  Feeling that his communications with Taza were threatened Henrys withdrew his ''groupes'' to the Kh<U+00E9>nifra area, both of them coming under attack en route.<ref name="hois83"/>  At M'Rirt a sizeable Zaian attack was repulsed with 200 casualties but the French suffered the loss of one officer and 24 men killed and 56 wounded.<ref name="hois83"/>

Lyautey had successfully retained the territory he had captured before the war but was of the opinion that he could not advance any further without risking "an extremely painful" mountain conflict.<ref name="hois83"/>  He faced having his troops withdrawn for service on the Western Front and being left with what he described as "degenerates and outcasts", a loss only partially mitigated by the expansion of the irregular tribal units to 21 ''goums'' in strength.<ref name="singer206">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=206}}.</ref><ref name="Bimberg12">{{Harvnb|Bimberg|1999|p=12}}.</ref>  Henrys accepted an offer of a position in France and was replaced by Colonel [[Joseph-Fran<U+00E7>ois Poeymirau]], a keen follower of Lyautey who had served as Henrys' second in command at Meknes.<ref name="hois84">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=84}}.</ref>  Lyautey was offered the post of [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]] at the invitation of Prime Minister [[Aristide Briand]], which he accepted on 12 December 1916.<ref name="hois83"/><ref name="singer207">{{Harvnb|Singer|Langdon|2004|p=207}}.</ref>  Lyautey was replaced, at his request, by General [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], who had experience fighting alongside Lyautey in Morocco and who had recently returned from the [[Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles]], where he had lost his right arm.<ref name="singer207"/><ref name="windrow438">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=438}}.</ref>  Lyautey soon became disillusioned with French tactics in Europe, the disunity prevailing between [[Allies of World War I|the Allies]] and his position as a symbolic figurehead of the government.<ref name="singer207"/><ref name="windrow438"/><ref name="tucker726">{{Harvnb|Tucker|2005|p=726}}.</ref>  He was unfamiliar with dealing with political opposition and resigned on 14 March 1917, after being shouted down in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref name="woodward270">{{Harvnb|Woodward|1967|p=270}}.</ref>  The government could not survive the resignation of such a senior cabinet member and Briand himself resigned on 17 March, to be replaced by [[Alexandre Ribot]].<ref name="woodward270"/>

Lyautey returned to his former position in Morocco at the end of May and immediately decided on a new strategy.  He concentrated his forces in the [[Moulouya River|Moulouya Valley]], convinced that the submission of the tribes in this area would lead to the collapse of the Zaian resistance.<ref name="singer207"/><ref name="tucker726"/><ref name="hois85">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=85}}.</ref>  In preparation for this new offensive Poeymirau established a French post at [[El Bekrit]], within Zaian territory, and forced the submission of three local tribes.<ref name="hois84"/>  He then used this post to protect his flanks during an advance south-eastwards into the valley, intending to meet with a column led by Colonel Paul Doury, advancing north-west from [[Boudenib]].<ref name="hois84"/><ref name="windrow441">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=441}}.</ref>  The two columns met at [[Assaka Nidji]] on 6 June, a moment which represented the establishment of the first French-controlled route across the Atlas mountains, and earned Poeymirau promotion to brigadier-general.<ref name="windrow442">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=442}}.</ref>  A defensive camp was soon established at [[Kasbah el Makhzen]], and Doury began construction on a road that he promised would be traversable by motor transport by 1918.<ref name="hois84"/>

By late 1917 motorised lorries were able to traverse much of the road, allowing the French to quickly move troops to areas of trouble and supply their garrisons in eastern Morocco from the west rather than over long routes from the Algerian depots.<ref name="windrow442"/>  A secondary road was constructed, leading southwards from the first along the [[Oued Ziz]], that allowed Doury to reach [[Rich, Morocco|Rich]] in the High Atlas, and major posts were established at [[Midelt]] and [[Missour]].<ref name="windrow442"/>  The Zaians refused to be drawn into attacking the fortified posts that the French built along their new roads, though other tribes launched attacks that summer after rumours of French defeats on the European front.<ref name="hois85"/>  In one instance, in mid-June, it took Poeymirau's entire ''groupe'' three days to restore control of the road after an attack.<ref name="hois85"/>

Doury had expanded the theatre of operations, against Lyautey's orders, by establishing a French mission at [[Tighmart]], in the [[Tafilalt]] region, in December 1917 in reaction to a rumoured German presence there.<ref name="hois85"/>  The land here, mainly desert, was almost worthless to the French and Lyautey was keen for his subordinates to focus on the more valuable Moulouya Valley.<ref name="hois86">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=86}}.</ref>  Local tribes resisted the French presence, killing a translator working at the mission in July 1918.<ref name="hois86"/>  Doury sought to avenge this act on 9 August by engaging up to 1,500 tribesmen, led by Sidi [[Mhand n'Ifrutant]], at [[Gaouz]] with a smaller French force that included artillery and aircraft support.<ref name="hois86"/><ref name="jaques383">{{Harvnb|Jaques|2007b|p=383}}.</ref>  Entering a thick, jungle-like date palm oasis, one subgroup of Doury's force suffered a close, hard-fought action,  hampered by exhaustion and poor supply lines.<ref name="hois85"/><ref name="windrow449">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=449}}.</ref>  The whole force suffered casualties of 238 men killed and 68 wounded, the worst French losses since the disaster at El Herri, and also lost much of their equipment and transport.<ref name="hois85"/><ref name="windrow452">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=452}}.</ref>  Lyautey was doubtful of Doury's claim to have almost wiped out his foe, and in response chastised him for his rash action in "this most peripheral of zones" and placed him under Poeymirau's direct command.<ref name="hois86"/><ref name="windrow452"/>  Thus, as the war in Europe was drawing to a close in the early summer of 1918, the French remained hard pressed in Morocco. Despite the death of Ali Amhaouch by natural causes, significant numbers of tribesmen under the leadership of Hammou and Said continued to oppose them.<ref name="hois85"/>

===The Central Powers in Morocco===
[[File:Abdelhafid 1914.jpg|thumb|Former Sultan Abdelhafid in 1914|alt=Sultan Abdelhafid seated on a settee behind a table]]
The Central Powers attempted to incite unrest in the Allied territories in Africa and the Middle East during the war, with the aim of diverting military resources away from the Western Front.<ref name="burke440">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=440}}.</ref>  German intelligence had identified Northwest Africa as the "[[Achilles' heel]]" of the French colonies, and encouraging resistance there became an important objective.<ref name="Lazaro96">{{Harvnb|L<U+00E1>zaro|1988|p=96}}.</ref>  Their involvement began in 1914, with the Germans attempting to find a suitable Moroccan leader that they could use to unite the tribes against the French.<ref name="burke444">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=444}}.</ref>  Their initial choice, former Sultan Abdelaziz, refused to co-operate and moved to the south of France to prevent any further approaches.<ref name="burke444"/>  Instead they entered negotiations with his successor Abdelhafid.  He initially co-operated with the Germans, renouncing his former pro-Allied stance in autumn 1914 and moving to [[Barcelona]] to meet with officials from Germany, the Ottoman Empire and the Moroccan resistance.<ref name="burke445">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=445}}.</ref>  During this time he was also selling information to the French.<ref name="burke445"/>  These mixed loyalties came to light when he refused to board a German submarine headed for Morocco, and the Central Powers decided he was of no further use.<ref name="burke445"/>  Abdelhafid then attempted to extort money from the French intelligence services, who responded by halting his pension and arranging his internment at [[El Escorial]].<ref name="burke445"/>  He was later awarded a stipend by Germany in return for his silence on the matter.<ref name="burke445"/>

The failure to find a suitable leader caused the Germans to alter their plans from a widespread insurrection in Morocco to smaller-scale support of the existing resistance movement.<ref name="burke445"/>  German support included the supply of military advisers and Foreign Legion deserters to the tribes as well as cash, arms and ammunition.<ref name="burke447">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=447}}.</ref>  Money (in both [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s and [[French franc|franc]]s) was smuggled into Morocco from the German embassy at Madrid.<ref name="burke454">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=454}}.</ref>  The money was transferred to [[Tetouan]] or [[Melilla]] by boat or wired through the [[telegraph]] before being smuggled to the tribes, who each received up to 600,000 pesetas per month.<ref name="burke454"/>  Weapons arrived through long-established routes from Spanish [[Larache]] or else purchased directly from French [[gun runner]]s or corrupt Spanish Army troops.<ref name="burke451">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=451}}.</ref>  The Germans found it hard to get resources to the Zaians in the Middle Atlas due to the distances involved and most of what did get through went to Said's forces.<ref name="burke448">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=448}}.</ref>  German attempts to distribute supplies inland were frustrated when many tribes hoarded the best resources.<ref name="burke452">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=452}}.</ref>  Ammunition remained scarce in the Middle Atlas, and many were forced to rely on locally manufactured gunpowder and cartridges.<ref name="burke452"/>

The Ottoman Empire also supported the Moroccan tribesmen in this period, having provided military training to them since 1909.<ref name="burke458">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=458}}.</ref>  They co-operated with German intelligence to write and distribute propaganda in Arabic, French and the Middle Atlas Berber dialect.<ref name="burke455">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=455}}.</ref>  Much of the Ottoman intelligence effort was coordinated by Arab agents operating from the embassy in Madrid and at least two members of the Ottoman diplomatic staff there are known to have seen active service with the tribes in Morocco during the war.<ref name="burke459">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=459}}.</ref>  Ottoman efforts in Morocco were hindered by internal divisions among the staff, disagreements with their German allies and the outbreak of the [[Arab Revolt]] in 1916, with which some of the embassy staff sympathised.<ref name="burke459"/>  These problems led many of the Ottoman diplomatic corps in Spain to leave for America in September 1916, bringing to an end many of the significant Ottoman operations in Morocco.<ref name="burke460">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=460}}.</ref>

French intelligence forces worked hard to combat the Central Powers and to win the support of the Moroccan people.  A series of commercial expositions, such as the [[Casablanca Fair of 1915]], were held to demonstrate the wealth of France and the benefits of co-operation.<ref name="burke449">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=449}}.</ref>  In addition to stepping up their propaganda campaign and increasing the use of bribes to convince tribes to submit, the French established markets at their military outposts and paid Moroccans to undertake [[public works]].<ref name="burke449"/>  Islamic scholars were also encouraged to issue [[fatw<U+0101>]]s supporting the Moroccan Sultan's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="burke456">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=456}}.</ref>

French and British intelligence agents co-operated in French and Spanish Morocco and Gibraltar, tracking Ottoman and German agents, infiltrating the advisers sent to the tribes and working to halt the flow of arms.<ref name="burke451"/><ref name="burke450">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=450}}.</ref>  German citizens in Morocco were placed under careful scrutiny and four were executed within days of the war's start.<ref name="strachan">{{Harvnb|Strachan|2003}}.</ref>  The French broke the codes used by the German embassy and were able to read almost every communication sent from there to the General Staff in Berlin.<ref name="burke450"/>  Bribes paid to staff at the Ottoman mission to Spain secured intelligence on the Central Powers' plans for Morocco.<ref name="burke450"/>

Although the efforts of the Central Powers caused a resurgence in resistance against French rule, they were largely ineffective, falling short of the planners' aims of a widespread jihad.<ref name="burke439"/><ref name="burke457">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=457}}.</ref><ref name="Lazaro93">{{Harvnb|L<U+00E1>zaro|1988|p=93}}.</ref>  There were few cases of mass civil disorder, France was not required to reinforce the troops stationed in Morocco, and the export of raw materials and labour for the war effort continued.<ref name="burke457"/>  Although they were never able to completely stem the flow of arms, despite considerable effort, the French were able to limit the supply of machine guns and artillery.<ref name="burke452"/><ref name="burke453">{{Harvnb|Burke|1975|p=453}}.</ref>  The tribes were thus unable to face the French in direct confrontation and had to continue to rely on ambushes and raids.<ref name="burke453"/> This contrasted with the Spanish experience in the [[Rif War (1920<U+2013>1926)|Rif War]] of 1920<U+2013>26, in which tribes with access to such weapons were able to inflict defeats upon the Spanish Army in the field, such as at the [[Battle of Annual]].<ref name="burke453"/>

Following the submission of his sons, Hammou retained command of only 2,500 tents and in Spring 1921 was killed in a skirmish with other Zaian tribes that opposed continued resistance.<ref name="hois89"/>  The French seized the opportunity to launch an assault on the last bastion of Zaian resistance, located near El Bekrit.<ref name="hois89"/>  In September a three-pronged attack was made: General [[Jean Th<U+00E9>veney]] moved west from the El Bekrit settlement, Colonel [[Henry Freydenberg]] moved east from [[Taka Ichian]] and a third group of submitted tribesmen under Hassan and his brothers also took part.<ref name="hois89"/><ref name="hois90">{{Harvnb|Hoisington|1995|p=90}}.</ref>  Th<U+00E9>veney encountered resistance from the Zaians in his area but Freydenberg was almost unopposed and within days all resistance was put down.<ref name="hois90"/>  After seven years of fighting the Zaian War was ended, though Lyautey continued his expansion in the area, promising to have all of "useful Morocco" under French control by 1923.<ref name="jaques383"/><ref name="hois90"/><ref name="windrow458">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=458}}.</ref>  Lyautey had been granted the dignity of a [[Marshal of France]] in 1921 in recognition of his work in Morocco.<ref name="windrow456">{{Harvnb|Windrow|2010|p=456}}.</ref>
