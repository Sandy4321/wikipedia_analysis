'''MICA: Multimedia, Information, Communication & Applications''' is an international [[research institute]] in [[Vietnam]]. 

==Aims==
Its purpose is to contribute to the development of [[information technology]] in [[Vietnam]].

==Affiliations==
MICA is affiliated to the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]], to the French [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], and to the [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]] (Grenoble-INP).<ref>[http://www.most.gov.vn/Desktop.aspx/Chi-tiet-bai-viet/Tin-tong-hop/Le_ky_niem_10_nam_thanh_lap_Vien_Nghien_cuu_quoc_te_MICA/] Announcement of the Vietnamese Ministry of Education on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Institute MICA</ref> 

==History==
MICA was officially created in 2002. The project of founding a high-level research centre in communication technology in Hanoi dates back to several years earlier. This project was realized through the implication of Vietnamese and French governmental institutions, and of the two Universities to which MICA is affiliated.<ref>[http://www2.cnrs.fr/journal/3257.htm] Article in the CNRS Journal, January 2007 (in French)</ref> 

In 2006, MICA was granted the status of Unit<U+00E9> Mixte Internationale (UMI) by [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]]. 

In 2011, MICA acquired the status of Institute within the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]].<ref>[http://www.grenoble-inp.fr/le-groupe/le-centre-mica-devient-l-institut-de-recherche-international-407175.kjsp] Article on the Grenoble INP website (in French)</ref> Since then, its full name has been: ''International Research Institute MICA, HUST <U+2013> CNRS/UMI-2954 <U+2013> Grenoble INP, Hanoi University of Science and Technology''.

==Organization==
The MICA Institute consists of 
* 3 research departments: 
** Speech Communication
** Computer Vision
** Pervasive Spaces and Interaction
* a centre for Technological Transfer and Applications
* and scientific and technological platforms.

==Sample of research projects==
* Speech communication: 
** APPSy (Asym<U+00E9>tries Phon<U+00E9>tique et Phonologique de la Syllabe, i.e. Phonetic and Phonological Asymmetries within the Syllable), funded by [[Agence nationale de la recherche]]. In partnership with GIPSA-Lab, LIDILEM, LIG, LPP and Phonolab-ULB/LSP (Belgium). Aim: to explore the links between mandibular gestures and syllabic structures, on the basis of a sample of languages with widely different syllable types and consonantal inventories: Tashlhiyt Berber, French, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Kinyarwanda, Ruwund, and Vietnamese. 
** AuCo (Audio Corpora). Aim: to put together an open-access collection of recordings of languages of [[Vietnam]] and neighbouring countries. In partnership with [[Pangloss_Collection|the Pangloss Collection (CNRS-LACITO)]] and SLDR (CNRS-LPL). AuCo stands for AudioCorpora; it is also a reference to [[<U+00C2>u C<U+01A1>]], a fairy who is mother to the Hundred Peoples ([[Baiyue|B<U+00E1>ch Vi<U+1EC7>t]]), ancestor to the Vietnamese and to the multitude of other ethnic groups of the area.

* Pervasive spaces: 
** VIPPA (Visually Impaired People Assistance using multimodal technologies). Aim: providing a framework for aiding blind pupils in their collective life in a school campus to navigate with safety in both indoor and outdoor environments and to improve their perception about contextual information. Project conducted within the framework of the Vietnam-Belgium programme VLIR, in partnership with IMEP-LAHC (France), LIG/PRIMA (France), Image Processing and Interpretation Research Groupe, Ghent University (Belgium), and Danang university (Vietnam).
** SYSAPA (Syst<U+00E8>me de surveillance pour l'assistance des personnes aveugles en environnement perceptifs). Project conducted within the framework of the Vietnamese-French programme Hoa Sen/Lotus, in partnership with IMEP-LAHC.
* Multimedia: 
** ICT-PAMM (Personal Assistance for Mobility and Manipulation). Project conducted within the framework of the 2010/2011 STIC-ASIE programme, in partnership with INRIA, LASMEA, Sungkyunhkwan University (Korea), NTU (Taiwan), and Humamoto University (Japan).<ref>[http://emotion.inrialpes.fr/people/spalanzani/HomePAMM.html] Web page of ICT-PAMM project</ref>
