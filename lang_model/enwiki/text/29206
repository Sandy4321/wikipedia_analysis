'''''All That''''' <!-- STOP...do NOT change to "was" -->is<!-- NOTE-remains as "is" per Wikipedia convention; see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]]. --> an American live-action, [[sketch comedy]]-variety show that aired on the [[Nickelodeon]] cable television network featuring short comedic sketches and weekly musical guests. The [[theme music|theme song]] for ''All That'' was performed by [[TLC (band)|TLC]]. Early episodes were taped at the closed [[Nickelodeon Studios]] at [[Universal Orlando Resort|Universal Orlando]], but then moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at the [[Nickelodeon On Sunset]] theater (formerly the Earl Carrol Theatre), where shows like ''[[The Amanda Show]]'', ''[[Kenan & Kel]]'', and ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' were also filmed.

''All That'' first aired on April 16, 1994, as a "sneak peek" and debuted as a regular series on December 24, 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=All That Original Air Date |work=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/all-that/show/3090/summary.html?tag=login;dropdown|accessdate=August 9, 2006}}</ref> It was also broadcast internationally, in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Spain and Canada.

''All That'' lasted ten seasons before it was canceled in 2005. The final episode aired on October 22, 2005 on the Nickelodeon network. The show started out in the [[SNICK]] block until 2004, when the network converted the SNICK time-slot into a second night for [[TEENick (block)|TEENick]].  In fact, the second era castmembers would host SNICK as the "On Air Dare" (a segment somewhat resembling [[Fear Factor]]) would be played between shows during commercial breaks.

== Cast ==
{{Main|List of All That cast members}}

== Creative process ==

Although [[Brian Robbins]] and [[Michael Tollin|Mike Tollin]] are credited as creators, the main creative force behind ''All That'' was [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] who became the [[showrunner]] of the series in the third season. ''All That'' marked the beginning of Schneider's prolific career in creating and writing hit television series for young audiences. The ''[[New York Times]]'', in separate articles, referred to Dan Schneider as "the [[Norman Lear]] of children's television"<ref>{{cite news |author=Jacques Steinberg |title=I, Little Sister, Becomes "iCarly" |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/arts/television/07icar.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |accessdate=May 27, 2008 | date=September 7, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080526180959/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/arts/television/07icar.html?_r=1&oref=slogin| archivedate= May 26, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and "the master of a television genre".<ref>{{cite news |author=Jonathan Dee |title=Tween on the Screen |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/magazine/08NICKELODEON.t.html?_r=1&ex=1176696000&en=b14f459487f2f913&ei=5070&emc=eta%7C1&oref=slogin |accessdate=May 27, 2008 | date=April 8, 2007}}</ref>

During Season 1, [[Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert]] were brought on as producers and continued working in that capacity through Season 3. The writing team advanced to Executive Producers/Head Writers for Seasons 4<U+2013>6. Kopelow and Seifert continued their relationship with [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]] by co-executive producing and head writing ''[[Kenan & Kel]]'' and eventually writing the feature film ''[[Good Burger]]'' (1997) with Schneider.

== Format ==
{{see also|List of All That musical guests}}
Borrowing heavily from the 1980s Canadian hit ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]'', ''All That'' featured a format of [[cold open]], [[sketch comedy|sketch-comedy]] pieces and a musical guest in its first six seasons and the final season. The cold opens took place in the [[green room]] five minutes before the show was to start. Usually, Kevin the Stage Manager (played by [[Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert|Kevin Kopelow]]) tries to rouse the cast members to preparation for the show by announcing ''"Five minutes!"''. Some of these cold opens included playing [[spin the bottle]] and having to kiss a [[cactus]], a [[squid]], or a chair; [[Kel Mitchell]] reenacting a fight on Kopelow; and guest star [[Mark Curry (actor)|Mark Curry]] tying up [[Kenan Thompson]] and wearing his Superdude costume. All other seasons featured a weekly host introducing and occasionally participating in the various sketches and a musical guest, a format pioneered by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

Many of the sketches were original material, although [[Bill Cosby]], [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne]], [[Steve Urkel]], [[Ross Perot]], and [[Bill Clinton]], were impersonated by [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Katrina Johnson]], [[Angelique Bates]], and [[Gabriel Iglesias]], respectively. The humor was very pre-teen-oriented; [[Josh Server]] would do things such as eat his own dandruff, eat a cereal called [[Lucky Charms|Lucky Germs]] or [[Froot Loops|Fruit Poots]], or appear on stage wearing only his underwear. From Season 7 onward, the humor was geared more toward younger viewers than the first six seasons.

In the first three seasons, ''All That'' used mostly [[urban contemporary|urban]] musical guests, but in later seasons aimed for more pop and rock acts.

=== Green rooms ===
In the beginning of each episode it would show some of the cast members in the greenroom. In Seasons 1<U+2013>6, the greenroom would have the ''All That'' logo painted on the wall and also had a sign that said ON AIR. In Seasons 7<U+2013>10, featured a view of the logo outside and an elevator and it also had a sign that said "To The Stage:". 

The greenroom in Season 1 was located on the set, which was mainly black with set equipment and a stairway to the backstage halls where the cast was also sometimes seen. The Green Room was also located in other parts of the studio (for example a meeting room). Season 2's greenroom was a lounging place for the cast members in which there were pop culture props.

Seasons 3-6's greenroom was the same when the show moved to Hollywood. Inside was the logo painted on the left wall, and couches, tables, chairs, and other pop culture props were seen. It also contained an ON-AIR light board above the door, where the cast left to do the show.

Seasons 7-10's greenroom was seen as a classic ''Now'' hang out room. Inside contained a couch, a kitchen section on the elevated part, which is also where the door was located. Props, pictures, and room accessories were all located throughout the room as well. A platinum inch television screen as also seen on the left hand side, that always displayed an ''All That'' logo.

=== Title sequences ===
For every season, there is an ''All That'' title sequence at the beginning after the greenrooms. At first in Seasons 1<U+2013>2; 3, the opening title was showing the cast and TLC on the classic 1990s streets, playing handball, and going through each cast members name in alphabetical order. After Bates' departure after Season 2, Bynes became a new member, so the title sequence was edited to include Bynes and remove Bates.

In Seasons 4<U+2013>5 title sequence, after Johnson and Reyes left the show in Season 3, the show got a new title open. Now with new cast members, Tamberelli, Knowings, and Frierson, the cast were seen walking down a classic [[red carpet]], dressed in classic Hollywood outfits. After Season 4, when Lori Beth had left, the title sequence was edited to edit her out, respectively.

In Season 6 title sequence, after Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell left, the show had to do another title sequence. This time, cast members Nick Cannon and Mark Saul were credited, and Gabriel Iglesias was added to the cast. The cast were seen up front in the camera behind a multi-color room ([[green screen]]).

In Season 7 and 8's title sequences, the show had an all new cast, and they were seen in the opening titles in white clothing behind a black room, where the new looked ''All That'' logo was seen in [[neon]] colors. In Season 8, Jamie Lynn Spears was added as a new member of the show, and was also in white clothing as the others.

In the Season 9 title sequences, after the departure of [[Bryan Hearne]], the cast of this season were seen behind the black room with the same kind of logo, but everyone is instead in red clothing, to mark the shows real color. Christina Kirkman joined the cast. Mid-way, [[Ryan Coleman]] joined the cast, and was added in. After this season, relaunch members Lyons, Samuels, and Season 8 member Spears left the show, and there was a final opening title.

=== Sketches ===
{{main|List of All That sketches}}

* '''''[[Good Burger]]''''' is a [[wikt:recurring|recurring]] sketch that took place at a fast food restaurant. The cashier, Ed played by [[Kel Mitchell]] in Seasons 1<U+2013>5 and [[Ryan Coleman]] in Season 9, was portrayed as a clueless teenager who always found a way to mess things up. A notable quote from Good Burger, stated by Kel in every episode, was "Welcome to Good Burger, home of the good burger, can I take your order?" When not dealing with a customer, he would bang on the cash register while singing "I'm a dude, she's a dude, he's a dude, 'cause we're all dudes. HEY!" ''Good Burger'' was later made into a [[Good Burger|1997 feature film]] starring Mitchell reprising his role as Ed and [[Kenan Thompson]] as a new character named Dexter. Frequent customers include: Bernie Kibbitz ([[Josh Server]]), Lester Oaks, Construction Worker ([[Kenan Thompson]]), and Connie Muldoon ([[Lori Beth Denberg]]). (Seasons 1<U+2013>5, 9<U+2013>10)

* '''''The Loud Librarian''''' was played by [[Lori Beth Denberg]], who would ironically yell out, "Quiet, this is a library!" along with various noisemakers such as foghorns or drums whenever the silence in her library was accidentally violated. (Seasons 2<U+2013>4)
* '''''Dullmont Jr. High School''''' is a known sketch that has many characters that carried into varying sketches, but remained the same. At the school, strange things would happen, mainly due to the eccentric staff members. (Seasons 1<U+2013>6)
*'''''Everyday French with Pierre [[Escargot]]''''', in which [[Kenan Thompson]] would deliver comical French phrases while sitting in a bathtub, wearing a yellow raincoat, and playing with his [[rubber duck]]. (Seasons 1<U+2013>5)

* '''''Vital Information''''' is a sketch in which [[Lori Beth Denberg]] for the first four seasons, [[Danny Tamberelli]] for seasons 5 and 6, and [[Lil' JJ]] in the tenth season deadpanned ridiculous sayings, usually three in a row.

=== Original era ===

==== Season One <U+2013> (1994<U+2013>1995) ====
This is the very first season of ''All That'', which began in 1994<U+2013>1995 with the pilot and 14 episodes.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.tv.com/all-that/phil-moore---tlc/episode/251709/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;2 |title= TV.com Season One debut |date= 2008-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111875/episodes#season-1 |title= Season 1 on IMDB |date= 2008-08-18}}</ref> On April 16, 1994, Nickelodeon aired the pilot which introduced the first cast members: [[Angelique Bates]], [[Lori Beth Denberg]], [[Katrina Johnson]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Alisa Reyes]], [[Josh Server]], and [[Kenan Thompson]].

==== Season Three <U+2013> (1996<U+2013>1997) ====
In the third season of ''All That'', [[Amanda Bynes]] joined the cast to replace the departing [[Angelique Bates]]. Bynes' characters and sketches included "Ask Ashley", "Space Sketch" (a ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' parody), "[[I Love Lucy|I Luv Lucy]]", and Meagen Marples, who loved to slap herself with liver.<ref name=FOB>''All That: Fresh Out the Box'', Steve Holland, Pocket Books, 1998</ref> Although limited to small roles for part of the season, Bynes became a breakout star; "Ask Ashley" was a favorite among fans.<ref name="Fresh Out The Box"/> About a year after Bynes' arrival, [[Katrina Johnson]] and [[Alisa Reyes]] left the show. Johnson left half-way because her contract expired, and Reyes left the show to pursue other acting work (Reyes would soon star in the [[TNBC]] sitcom ''[[One World (TV series)|One World]]'' in 1998). During the second half of Season 3, when Katrina Johnson left the show, only appearing in sketches taped before her departure, she was replaced by temporary cast member, [[Tricia Dickson]].

==== Season Four <U+2013> (1997<U+2013>1998) ====
In Season 4 there were three new faces: [[Christy Knowings]], [[Leon Frierson]], and [[Danny Tamberelli]], and featuring cast members Zack McLemore, who joined for half a season, and Victor-Cohn Lopez.

Tamberelli's characters and sketches included "Jack Campbell: Fat Cop", Hairy Spice from the [[Spice Girls|Spice Boys]], ''Cheeseburger Doyle: Private Eye'', a talk show host named Francis the Caveman, and ''Vital Information'' host, succeeding Lori Beth Denberg in Season 5&6.<ref name="FOB"/>

Knowings's sketches and characters included "Whateverrr!!" co-host Jessica, the nurse for unlikely dentist Dr. Bynes (played by Josh Server), and Miss Klump, the teacher when Lori Beth Denberg <U+2013> who played teacher Miss Fingerly <U+2013> had left the series.

The entire Season 4 cast was, in alphabetical order, Amanda Bynes, Lori Beth Denberg, Leon Frierson, Christy Knowings, Kel Mitchell, Josh Server, Danny Tamberelli, and Kenan Thompson with featuring cast members Victor-Cohn Lopez and Zack McLemore appearing sporadically. Christy Knowings and Danny Tamberelli are said to also be breakout stars of the new cast. Comedian and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Farley]] made one of his last guest appearances on the show, right before his death in December 1997.

Season 4 was also Lori Beth Denberg's final season on the show. In a live chat on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)#Nick.com|Nick.com]], she reasoned that she left ''All That'', because she "was getting older".<ref name="Why Lori Beth left">{{cite web | author=Nick.com | year=1999 | title=Nickelodeon --- Past Chats | work=Nick.com | url=http://www.nick.com/blab/past_chats/archive_22.jhtml |accessdate=December 20, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061113215622/http://www.nick.com/blab/past_chats/archive_22.jhtml| archivedate= November 13, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Denberg would soon become a cast member of ''[[The Steve Harvey Show]]'' in 1998.

==== Season Five <U+2013> (1998<U+2013>1999) ====
As the show was entering its fifth season, [[Danny Tamberelli]] succeeded Denberg in the "Vital Information" sketch, and Tamberelli was given a new set and a new desk unlike that of Denberg's "Vital Information". This season also brought in two new faces, [[Nick Cannon]] and [[Mark Saul (actor)|Mark Saul]].

Cannon's sketches and characters included Sweaty Spice from the Spice Boys; Latanya, a cashier at the [[convenience store]] Quick-N-Fast; and a bank robber in a superhero sketch called "Boring Man".

''All That'' celebrated its star-studded "[[All That Live! (100th episode)|100th episode]]" during this season, although it was actually the 85th episode to be produced. This one-hour special was one of the only episodes (other than the 10th anniversary) in the show's history produced [[live television|live]].<ref name="All That 100th Episode">{{cite web | title=All That: 100th Episode | work=TV.com | url=http://www.tv.com/all-that/100th-episode/episode/377392/summary.html|accessdate=December 20, 2006}}</ref> The actual 100th episode occurred during a Season 6 episode.<ref name="All That 100th Episode"/> The Season 5 cast included, in alphabetical order: [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Leon Frierson]], [[Christy Knowings]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Josh Server]], [[Danny Tamberelli]], and [[Kenan Thompson]]  featuring  [[Nick Cannon]]  &  [[Mark Saul (actor)|Mark Saul]].

The 100th episode featured several celebrities: [[Melissa Joan Hart]] (''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]''), [[Larisa Oleynik]] (''[[The Secret World of Alex Mack]]''), [[Robert Ri'chard]] (''[[Cousin Skeeter]]''), [[Stephen Collins (actor)|Stephen Collins]] (''[[7th Heaven]]'') as an audience member, and [[Britney Spears]] (in a taped video appearance; Spears was originally supposed to perform in person but had to back out due to a knee injury; [[Lauryn Hill]] took her place) all made appearances. Former cast member [[Lori Beth Denberg]], wearing her traditional "Vital Information" outfit, made her final appearance on the show to do the sketch. Former cast members [[Angelique Bates]], [[Katrina Johnson]], and [[Alisa Reyes]] made brief appearances on the red carpet. The show continued on winning its first KCA for Favorite TV Show in 1999.<ref name="Kids' Choice Awards">{{cite news |url= http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Kids_Choice_Awards_USA/1999 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080123123654/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Kids_Choice_Awards_USA/1999 |archivedate= 2008-01-23 |title= 1999 Kids Choice Awards IMDB |accessdate= 2007-08-11}}</ref> Plus in 1999, Thompson became the host of Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' for the 2nd season.

=== Season Six and temporary cancellation (2000) ===
Season 6 began with new cast member [[Gabriel Iglesias]], along with the departure of [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]], who proceeded to start production of the final season of their own series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]''. Also on many occasions during season 6, [[Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert|Kevin Kopelow]] would appear a few times because of co-producing other Nickelodeon shows. Co-executive producer [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] had left ''All That'' on season 5 to work on ''[[The Amanda Show]]''. To replace Schneider, Kevin Kopelow and [[Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert|Heath Seifert]] were promoted to co-executive producers/showrunners for seasons 5 and 6.  It is also rumored that cast member [[Amanda Bynes]] was supposed to leave ''All That'' after season 5 to continue working on ''The Amanda Show'', but she returned for the season. The show went on hiatus after a 14 episode season.

To keep the show running, the producers compiled a series called, "[[All That (Season six)#Best of all That (2001)|Best of All That]]", which were episodes featuring the Season 4 cast members: [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Lori Beth Denberg]], [[Leon Frierson]], [[Christy Knowings]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Josh Server]], [[Danny Tamberelli]], and [[Kenan Thompson]]. After those eight episodes, three more "Best of" episodes were produced, "Peas, Cheese, Bag of Chips" (that had skits featuring food), "Dates, Goats, and Romance" (which shows clips from skits that had goats, dates, love or even all three elements), and "Best of Music" (showing several musical performances from season 6 only).

Eventually, Nickelodeon canceled ''All That'' for a short time. Josh Server became the longest serving cast member since being an original cast member since the first season in 1994. In the meantime, the show won another KCA in 2000,<ref name="2000s KCAs">{{cite news |url= http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Kids_Choice_Awards_USA/2000 |title=2000 Kids Choice IMDB |date=2008-08-18}}</ref> and went into reruns until 2001. ''All That'' skipped the 2000<U+2013>2001 television season during the lead-up to its relaunch.

=== New era begins (2002<U+2013>2005) ===
After the television season hiatus, the new era of ''All That'' began in 2002 after Dan Schneider agreed with Nickelodeon to bring back All That after [[The Amanda Show]] was unexpectedly cancelled in 2002. Nickelodeon has titled the second run of ''All That'', "'''The Relaunch Era'''". This is because at the beginning when Nickelodeon ended the first run, all the old cast members from Season 6 were replaced by a new cast.

Other changes occurred before the start of the season as well. The show got rid of the long-running sketch "Vital Information" which had been featured in every show since the first season. Instead they replaced it with a new sketch called "Know Your Stars", which was featured in almost every episode of this season and onward. The show also got rid of the traditional green room, where the cast would hang out. In this season, the cast would be featured walking around the studio instead of being in one area. Another change was the absence of [[Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert|Kevin Kopelow]]. A long-running gag in the first six seasons was Kevin The Stage Manager, who was usually hurt in some way. Instead he was replaced with Pickle Boy, a random person who would usually be seen offering people pickles. Pickle Boy would also be seen at the end of the episode with the celebrity guest. The celebrity guest usually dislikes the pickles and sometimes even assaults Pickle Boy because how bad the pickles tasted having Pickle Boy walking around with pickles that could have gone bad. 

Now, the new openings are: The theme opening ''(with audience as sound fx)'', cast members in alphabetical order, Special Guest (if necessary), musical guest, and ending groups.

==== Season Seven <U+2013> (2002) ====
The first episode of the "new" ''All That'' featured special guests [[Frankie Muniz]] and [[Aaron Carter]] and aired from January 19, 2002 to May 4, 2002.<ref name="All That Season 7 Premiere1">{{cite web | title=All That Season 7| work=TV.com | url=http://www.tv.com/all-that/show/3090/episode.html?season=7&tag=nav_bar%3b7}}</ref> The seventh season and ongoing season theme openings/outro themes were slightly remixed to fit the relaunch. In this particular episode, Muniz was seen running around the streets grabbing random people to be the new cast members. It also doesn't have an announcer saying "fresh out of the box, stop, look and watch, ready yet, get set, it's ''All That''." Also on every beginning of an episode, you don't hear the ''All That'' instrumental theme.

Season 7 kicked off with cast members [[Chelsea Brummet]], [[Jack DeSena]], [[Lisa Foiles]], [[Bryan Hearne]], [[Shane Lyons]], [[Giovonnie Samuels]], and [[Kyle Sullivan]]. At the beginning when the cast headed off to do the show, the audience was not shown anymore and it went right to the beginning credits.

===== Weekly guest stars =====
In conjunction with the seventh season, ''All That'' brought in weekly special guest stars who helped open the show and participated in some of the sketches. ''All That'' during the era prior to the relaunch had some guest stars including [[Joyce Brothers|Dr. Joyce Brothers]] in one segment of "Ask Ashley", [[John Leguizamo]] in character from the movie ''[[The Pest (1997 film)|The Pest]]'', and [[Sherman Hemsley]] in a cold open, and again in a "Good Burger" sketch.

Among the guest stars who appeared during this period were former cast members [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Amanda Bynes]], (Season 7) and [[Nick Cannon]] (Season 8).

Joining the cast in Season 8 was [[Jamie Lynn Spears]], who was previously better known for being the younger sister of [[popular music|pop star]], [[Britney Spears]]. Season 8 marked the beginning of ''All That'' cast members started attempting dares on the [[SNICK]] program: ''[[Snick On-Air Dare]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=3189946 |title= MySpaceTV Kyle's On-Air Dare video |publisher= myspace.com |date= 2008-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ks3o8pIorA |title=Jamie's On Air Dare on Youtube.com |work=Youtube |date= 2008-08-19}}</ref> Occasionally, On Air Dares had special guests from other shows.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUyKTkke00o&feature=related |title= Ned's Declassified on On Air Dare|work=youtube|date=2008-08-19}}</ref>

Before Season 8 ended, Nickelodeon advertised a competition called ''[[R U All That?: Nickelodeon's Search for the Funniest Kid in America]]''. After this contest ended in 2003, the finals aired on July 26, 2003. The contest picked five finalists, and all of them performed a sketch with some of the cast members. The winner was [[Christina Kirkman]], and the runner up was [[Ryan Coleman]]. Kirkman became a regular cast member from that point.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nick.com/all_nick/specials/areYouAllThat/videos/ |title= 2003, R U All That?'s winner |date= 2004-07-27}}</ref>

==== Season Nine <U+2013> (2003<U+2013>2004) ====
In Season 9, [[Christina Kirkman]] earned her spot on ''All That'' by winning the ''R U All That'' contest. [[Ryan Coleman]], who was the runner-up, soon also got a part on the show midway into Season 9 to replace [[Bryan Hearne]], who left at the end of Season 8. During this season and Season 10, the cast attempted to resurrect some of the classic sketches, like "Good Burger" (with Ryan Coleman as Ed), and "Vital Information" (with Lil' JJ as the anchor). The cast of Season 9 continued to do On-Air Dares.

This was the final season for Joel Elijah Moore, [[Shane Lyons]], [[Giovonnie Samuels]], and [[Jamie Lynn Spears]]. In 2004, ''All That'' won another KCA for Favorite TV Show at the [[2004 Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref name="KCApress">{{cite news |url= http://www.nickkcapress.com/2004KCA/index.php| title= 2004 Kids Choice Press Release | accessdate = 2008-08-18 |date=2008-08-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080716014129/http://www.nickkcapress.com/2004KCA/index.php| archivedate= July 16, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> After the last episode aired in Season 9, Nickelodeon put the show on a short hiatus for the Fall of 2004. The show then returned when the 10th Anniversary ended. Also in this season, weekly guests no longer appeared, only musical guests. This format continued until the cancellation.

==== 10th Anniversary (2005) ====
In 2005, Nickelodeon celebrated the 10th anniversary of ''All That'' by airing episodes from the first six seasons in the week leading up to a "reunion special" hosted by [[Frankie Muniz]] on April 23. [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]] and [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] were the musical guests.<ref name="Hollywood.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/tv/All_That_10th_Anniversary_Reunion_Special/5205676|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080603040946/http://www.hollywood.com/tv/All_That_10th_Anniversary_Reunion_Special/5205676|archivedate=2008-06-03|title=All That 10th Anniversary Cast and Crew Info|date=2005-08-28|work=[[Hollywood.com]]|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name="Hollywood.com"/>

[[Kenan Thompson]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Josh Server]], and [[Danny Tamberelli]] reunited on the show.<ref name="Hollywood.com"/> In addition, [[Nick Cannon]] appeared on the special but only via [[satellite]] in a Repairman sketch. Other cast members attended but had no speaking parts (namely: [[Katrina Johnson]], [[Alisa Reyes]], [[Leon Frierson]], [[Mark Saul (actor)|Mark Saul]], [[Angelique Bates]], [[Christy Knowings]], and [[Giovonnie Samuels]]). [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Lori Beth Denberg]], [[Bryan Hearne]], [[Gabriel Iglesias]], and [[Shane Lyons]] did not appear. Iglesias was left out of the opening intro also.<ref name="Hollywood.com"/>

Approximately 6.2 million total viewers watched the special on both its April 23 and 24 airings, making it the top [[cable television|cable]] or [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] program for the 2<U+2013>11, 6<U+2013>11, and 9<U+2013>14 age [[demographics]],<ref name="All That 10th Anniversary_8675309">{{cite news| date=April 26, 2005 | title=Nick's All That 10th Anniversary Reunion Special is a Hit with Kids and Tweens| agency=PR Newswire| publisher=Nickelodeon |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-26-2005/0003487413&EDATE= |accessdate=December 20, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0509723/|title=All That 10 Anniversary on IMDB|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=imdb.com}}</ref> and [[TV.com]] gave it a rating of 8.7/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com//all-that-10th-anniversary-reunion-special/episode/418156/summary.html?q=All%20That%2010th%20anniversary&tag=search_results;episode_title;1|title=All That 10 Anniversary Summary and Info on TV.com|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=TV.com}}</ref>

The last segment of this episode paid tribute to the ending soundclip of the original seasons. As the room for the 10 year anniversary party was empty, Kenan and Kel stood sleeping in the costumes of their roles as Mavis & Clavis. Kenan wakes up and says "Hey, Clavis!, wake up, the show's over," and Kel responds with his signature, "Ah yeah, kick it". They then turn and slowly walk away as the screen fades to black in a dramatic yet subtle ending to the 10 year tribute.

===== Return of "Vital Information" =====
After a four season hiatus, ''All That'' decided to bring back the "Vital Information" segment with [[Black Entertainment Television|BET's]] ''Coming to the Stage'' winner [[Lil' JJ]] succeeding [[Lori Beth Denberg]] and [[Danny Tamberelli]], respectively. Lil' JJ's very first "Vital Information" occurred during the ''10th Anniversary Reunion Special''.

==== Season Ten <U+2013> The Final Season (2005) ====
The tenth (and what turned out to be the final) season of ''All That'' began after the 10th anniversary, with [[Kianna Underwood]] and [[Denzel Whitaker]] as the two new cast members that were added after the departure of [[Shane Lyons]], [[Giovonnie Samuels]], and [[Jamie Lynn Spears]] (who left to work on ''[[Zoey 101]]''). They joined the returning cast [[Jack DeSena]], [[Lisa Foiles]], [[Chelsea Brummet]], [[Kyle Sullivan]], [[Christina Kirkman]], and [[Ryan Coleman]]. Also, Lil' JJ was part of the cast this season as a featured player doing "Vital Information". 

Some of the relaunch sketches to be discontinued, including: Stacey Chit, Advice From the Old Lady in Shane's Mouth, The Old Lady Show, Bloopers, Harry Bladder, Connect The Zits and the Crazy Taxi Driver.

The 10th season was slated for 16 episodes (2 episodes aired only in Australia) until the cancellation. At the start of this season, they used [[Urban contemporary|urban]] musical guests again. Cast member Jack DeSena, meant to leave after Season 9 to  continue to work on ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', remained on the show.

Season 10 ended on October 22, 2005, with the show reaching 175 episodes.

==== Cancellation (2005) ====
According to [[Lisa Foiles]] on her [http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/LisaFoilesClub Official Yahoo! Group], the rumors of the impending cancellation of ''All That'' were in fact, true. This was the message posted on Lisa's club by Lisa Foiles herself (as of September 5, 2005):<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/LisaFoilesClub/message/15132 |title=Answer to your "All That" question... |publisher= groups.yahoo.com |date=2005-09-05 |accessdate= 2008-08-20}}</ref>
{{quote|I know there's been a lot of speculating on the subject of ''All That'' being canceled, and I thought I'd be the one to tell you that it's true. ''All That'' has finally come to an end. I found out a few weeks ago, but didn't know if I should tell anyone. I guess if ten years is long enough for ''[[Friends]]'', and it's long enough for us, too! I probably would have moved on anyway, even if it didn't get canceled. I was getting a little too old for the show and I believe that it should always have a cast of younger kids, no older than 18. Where I will go from here, I'm not sure, but I have a few things in the works. All I ask is that you guys keep me and the other cast members in your prayers, that we can step into bigger and better things!:)<br />So, I guess that's....''All That!!!''|Luv Alwayz <U+2013> Lisa}}
Many online petitions were made during the past 9 years after "All That" got cancelled, however; it was the one from Change.org that made Nickelodeon really think about bringing the show back on the air. The network has been in talks with Dan Schneider for the past couple of months about bringing "All That" back on the air with new episodes, and they were even thinking about bringing in people from YouTube to be on the show.<ref>((cite web urlhttp://www.change.org/petitions/nickelodeon-dan-schneider-schneider-s-bakery-bring-back-all-that-please date 2013-03-24  </ref>

On November 29, 2011, the ''iTunes Store'' released ''All That: Volume 2'' with seven more episodes from season two. ''All That: Volume 3'' was released in 2012 with seven episodes from season two. Just like ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' airings, the musical guest performances are omitted and the end credits are re-done as generic white text on black.<ref>[http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/all-that-vol.-1/id453549688 ''All That: Volume 1''], iTunes Store</ref>  "All That Volume 4" with episodes from the start of season 3 was released on iTunes August 13, 2012, however episodes 40 and 43 are excluded for unknown reasons with episodes 45 and 46 included instead.

On June 24, 2013, the [[iTunes Store]] released ''All That: Retro Essentials'' with four episodes from season two. The episodes are 217, 220, 228, 237. Episodes 217, 220 and 228 were re-released with the musical guest performances. Episode 237 has the musical guest edited out.

==Reruns/Syndication==
''All That'' ran on [[Nickelodeon (TV Channel)|Nickelodeon]] from 1994 until 2005 (its entire original run). ''All That'' aired on [[Nick at Nite]] on Mondays thru Thursdays at 8:00pm from June 25, 2012, until July 12, 2012, alongside [[Kenan & Kel]] at 8:30pm. The Nick@Nite airings, had the musical performances edited out. ''All That'' ran in reruns on [[TeenNick]] from March 12, 2008, to September 15, 2008.

''All That'' once again aired on [[TeenNick]] from July 25, 2011, to December 27, 2012, as part of ''[[The '90s Are All That]]''. The show returned to TeenNick on The '90s Are All That, and has aired since March 4, 2013. The '90s Are All That airings, however, also have the musical guest performances removed, along with their introduction sketches, presumably for time and the high cost of obtaining music distribution rights. For some unknown reason, the first season wasn't aired. The reruns on [[TeenNick]] in 2008 however, aired the show uncut and retained the musical guest performances, with the exception of the [[K-Ci]] & [[K-Ci & JoJo|JoJo]] episode.

In a rare tribute to ''All That'', [[Kenan Thompson]] complains in "[[iParty with Victorious]]" (a crossover between ''[[iCarly]] and [[Victorious]]'') that everyone wants to borrow money from him, including half of the original cast of ''All That''. [[Tori Vega]] (portrayed by [[Victoria Justice]]) comments that she used to love that show.

On November 4, 2012, ''All That'' returned to [[Nickelodeon]] with two episodes at 6:30pm and 7:00pm, and the musical performances edited out.
