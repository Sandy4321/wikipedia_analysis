'''Manchester United Football Club''' is an English professional [[association football|football]] club, based in [[Old Trafford, Greater Manchester]], that plays in the [[Premier League]]. Founded as '''Newton Heath LYR Football Club''' in 1878, the club changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to [[Old Trafford]] in 1910.

In 1968, under the management of [[Matt Busby]], Manchester United was the first English football club to win the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], ten years after the [[Munich air disaster]] that claimed the lives of eight players.

Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] depot at [[Newton Heath]].<ref name="barnes_8">Barnes et al. (2001), p. 8.</ref> The team initially played games against other departments and rail companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company <U+2013> green and gold <U+2013> they were defeated 6<U+2013>0 by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]' reserve team.<ref>James (2008), p. 66.</ref> By 1888, the club had become a founding member of [[The Combination]], a regional football league. However, following the league's dissolution after just one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed [[Football Alliance]], which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892<U+2013>93 season in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], by which time it had become independent of the rail company and dropped the "LYR" from its name.<ref name="barnes_8"/> After just two seasons, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].<ref name="barnes_8"/>

In January 1902, with debts of <U+00A3>2,670 <U+2013> equivalent to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2670|1902|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|group=nb}} <U+2013> the club was served with a [[liquidation|winding-up order]].<ref>Tyrrell & Meek (1996), p. 99.</ref> Captain [[Harry Stafford]] found four local businessmen, including [[John Henry Davies]] (who became club president), each willing to invest <U+00A3>500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;<ref name="barnes_9">Barnes et al. (2001), p. 9.</ref> on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.<ref>James (2008), p. 92.</ref><ref group=nb>Sources are divided on the exact date of the meeting and subsequent name change. Whilst official club sources claim that it occurred on 26 April, the meeting was reported by the ''Manchester Evening Chronicle'' in its 25 April edition, suggesting it was indeed on 24 April.</ref> Under [[Ernest Mangnall]], who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 <U+2013> the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]]<ref>Barnes et al. (2001), p. 118.</ref> and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref>Barnes et al. (2001), p. 11.</ref>

In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a [[yo-yo club]], achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of the club's principal benefactor, {{nowrap|J. H. Davies}}, in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for [[James W. Gibson]], who, in December 1931, invested <U+00A3>2,000 and assumed control of the club.<ref name="barnes_12">Barnes et al. (2001), p. 12.</ref> In the [[1938<U+2013>39 in English football|1938<U+2013>39 season]], the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.<ref name="barnes_12"/>

In October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.<ref>Barnes et al. (2001), p. 13.</ref> Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in [[1948 FA Cup Final|1948]].

The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against [[Red Star Belgrade]], the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The [[Munich air disaster]] of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Geoff Bent]], [[Roger Byrne]], [[Eddie Colman]], [[Duncan Edwards]], [[Mark Jones (footballer)|Mark Jones]], [[David Pegg]], [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[Billy Whelan]]&nbsp;<U+2013> and injured several more.<ref>{{cite news |title=1958: United players killed in air disaster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/6/newsid_2535000/2535961.stm |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 February 1958 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}</ref><ref>Barnes et al.

Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.<ref>White, Jim (2008), p. 136.</ref><ref>Barnes et al.

The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating [[S.L.

Following an eighth-place finish in the [[1969<U+2013>70 in English football|1969<U+2013>70 season]] and a poor start to the [[1970<U+2013>71 in English football|1970<U+2013>71 season]], Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, [[Frank O'Farrell]] was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18&nbsp;months before being replaced by [[Tommy Docherty]] in December 1972.<ref>Murphy (2006), p. 134.</ref> Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.<ref name="barnes_18-19"/> The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in [[1976 FA Cup Final|1976]], but were beaten by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. They reached the final again in [[1977 FA Cup Final|1977]], beating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2<U+2013>1.

[[Dave Sexton]] replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]], [[Gordon McQueen]], [[Gary Bailey]], and [[Ray Wilkins]], the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979<U+2013>80 and lost to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]]. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.<ref name="barnes_20">Barnes et al.

Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years <U+2013> in [[1983 FA Cup Final|1983]] and [[1985 FA Cup Final|1985]]. In [[1985<U+2013>86 in English football|1985<U+2013>86]], after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place.

==Crest and colours==
[[File:Manchester United Badge 1960s-1973.png|thumb|Manchester United badge in the 1960s|alt=A football crest. In the centre is a shield with a ship in full sail above a red field with three diagonal black lines. Either side of the shield are two stylised roses, separating two scrolls. The upper scroll is red and reads "Manchester United" in black type, while the lower scroll is white with "Football Club" also written in black.]]
The club crest is derived from the [[Manchester City Council#Coat of arms|Manchester City Council coat of arms]], although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.<ref name="Barnes_49">Barnes et al. (2001), p. 49.</ref> The devil stems from the club's nickname "The Red Devils"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 (unless the team was playing in a Cup Final).<ref name="Barnes_49"/>

A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing a red-and-white quartered jerseys and blue shorts.<ref name="Barnes_48">Barnes et al. (2001), p. 48.</ref> Between 1894<U+2013>96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys<ref name="Barnes_48"/> which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with blue shorts.<ref name="Barnes_48"/> After its name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.<ref name="Barnes_48"/> Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red "V" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the [[1909 FA Cup Final]]. They would remain part of their home kits until 1927.<ref name="Barnes_48"/> In 1934, players sported cherry and white hooped shirts, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division.<ref name="Barnes_48"/> The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971, when the club reverted to black. The current home kit is a red shirt with a white collar, worn with white shorts and black socks.<ref>{{cite news |title=New home kit unveiled |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Jul/New-home-kit-unveiled.aspx |page=1 |publisher=ManUtd.com (Manchester United) |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}</ref>

The Manchester United away strip has more often than not been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions.

Newton Heath initially played on a field on [[North Road (football ground)|North Road]], close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.<ref name="white_21">White, Jim (2008) p. 21.</ref> Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891 Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000&nbsp;spectators.<ref>James (2008), p. 392.</ref> Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 4 March 1893.<ref>Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 54.</ref> A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.<ref>Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 51.</ref>

In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary [[A. H. Albut]] procured the use of the [[Bank Street (football ground)|Bank Street ground]] in [[Clayton, Manchester|Clayton]].<ref name="shury_21-22"/> It initially had no stands, by the start of the [[1893<U+2013>94 in English football|1893<U+2013>94 season]], two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the "Bradford end". At the opposite end, the "Clayton end", the ground had been "built up, thousands thus being provided for".<ref name="shury_21-22">Shury & Landamore (2005), pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref> Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw [[Alf Farman]] score a [[hat-trick]], Newton Heath's only goals in a 3<U+2013>2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] three weeks later.<ref name="shury_21-22"/> In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the [[Broughton Rangers]] [[rugby league]] club, and put up another stand on the "reserved side" (as distinct from the "popular side"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.<ref>Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 24.</ref>

When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at [[Harpurhey]] for the next reserves game against Padiham.<ref>Shury & Landamore (2005), pp. 33<U+2013>34.</ref> Following financial investment, new club president J.H. Davies paid <U+00A3>500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.<ref name="inglis_234">Inglis (1996), p. 234.</ref> Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.<ref name="inglis_234"/>

However, following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;<ref name="inglis_234"/> in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around <U+00A3>60,000. Architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was given a budget of <U+00A3>30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] drew 76,962&nbsp;spectators.<ref>Rollin and Rollin, pp. 254<U+2013>255.</ref>

Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the [[War Damage Commission]] in the amount of <U+00A3>22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its "home" games at Manchester City's [[Maine Road]] ground; Manchester United was charged <U+00A3>5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.<ref>White, John (2007), p. 11.</ref> Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a [[cantilever]]ed structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the [[1993<U+2013>94 in English football|1993<U+2013>94 season]].<ref name="barnes_19"/> First used on 25&nbsp;March 1957 and costing <U+00A3>40,000, four {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}} pylons were erected, each housing 54&nbsp;individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.<ref>Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 44<U+2013>45.</ref>

The [[Taylor Report]]'s requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998<U+2013>99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd 3<U+2013>0 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4820120.stm |work=BBC Sport  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2011 }}</ref> The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 4<U+2013>1, with just 114 seats (0.15&nbsp;percent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Report: United 4 Blackburn 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2007/Mar/Report-United-4-Blackburn-1.aspx |publisher=ManUtd.com (Manchester United) |date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}</ref> In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.<ref name="inside_united">Morgan (2010), pp. 44<U+2013>48.</ref><ref name="record_gate">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=OT100 #9: Record gate |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/The-OT-100-News/2009/Nov/OT100-9-Record-gate.aspx |publisher=ManUtd.com (Manchester United) |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}</ref> Manchester United has the third highest [[Average attendances of European football clubs|average attendance of European football clubs]] only behind [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]].

==Global brand==
[[File:Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 ManU Karakas.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Turkish Airlines]] is an official sponsor of the club, as shown by a [[Boeing 737-800]] [[logojet]] seen here at [[Atat<U+00FC>rk International Airport]] in April 2011.]]
Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by [[Brand Finance]], valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at <U+00A3>412&nbsp;million <U+2013> an increase of <U+00A3>39&nbsp;million on the previous year, valuing it at <U+00A3>11&nbsp;million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid <U+2013> and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 30 Football Club Brands |url=http://www.brandfinance.com/images/upload/top_30_european_football_brands_2011_final_website.pdf |publisher=Brand Finance |accessdate=4 October 2011 |month=September |year=2011 |format=PDF }}</ref> In 2011,  Manchester United was ranked first by [[Forbes]] magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $1.86&nbsp;billion.<ref name="bstonfrbs"/> The club is currently ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).<ref name="Deloitte_money_league">{{cite news |title=Real Madrid becomes the first sports team in the world to generate <U+20AC>400m in revenues as it tops Deloitte Football Money League |url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/d039400401a17210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm |work=Deloitte |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2010 }}</ref>

The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.<ref name="barnes_52"/> The "iconic" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded "[[catenaccio]]" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) "captured the imagination of the English footballing public".<ref name="hamil_116">Hamil (2008), p. 116.</ref> Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the "fifth [[The Beatles|Beatle]]" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.<ref name="hamil_116"/>

Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]] broadcasting deal.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 120.</ref> Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005<U+2013>06, the club's commercial arm generated <U+00A3>51&nbsp;million, compared to <U+00A3>42.5&nbsp;million at Chelsea, <U+00A3>39.3&nbsp;million at Liverpool, <U+00A3>34&nbsp;million at Arsenal and <U+00A3>27.9&nbsp;million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship is with sportswear company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], who manage the club's merchandising operation as part of a <U+00A3>303&nbsp;million 13-year partnership established in 2002.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 122.</ref> Through ''Manchester United Finance'' and the club's membership scheme, ''One United'', those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services <U+2013> such as the club's dedicated television channel, ''MUTV'' <U+2013> have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.<ref name="hamil_126"/>

===Listings on stock exchanges===
As the first English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 124.</ref> The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities <U+2013> the value of which is driven by television exposure.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 121.</ref> During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beckham fever grips Japan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2999514.stm |work=BBC Sport  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 June 2003 |accessdate=20 June 2010 }}</ref>

==Ownership and finances==
{{See also|Glazer ownership of Manchester United}}
Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for <U+00A3>1 via an application form.<ref name="barnes_9"/> In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested <U+00A3>500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president J.H Davies.<ref name="barnes_9"/> After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after investing <U+00A3>2,000.<ref name="barnes_12"/> Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,<ref>Crick & Smith (1990), p. 181.</ref> but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club,<ref>Crick & Smith (1990), p. 92.</ref> but the position of chairman passed to former player [[Harold Hardman]].<ref>White, Jim (2008), p. 92.</ref>

Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately <U+00A3>40,000, he accumulated a 54&nbsp;percent shareholding and took control in January 1964.<ref>Dobson & Goddard (2004), p. 190.</ref> When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin in 1978; [[Martin Edwards]] went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.<ref name="knighton_bid">{{cite news|title=1989: Man U sold in record takeover deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/18/newsid_2499000/2499267.stm |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=24 June 2010 | date=18 August 1989}}</ref> Media tycoon [[Robert Maxwell]] attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.<ref name="knighton_bid"/> In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to [[Michael Knighton]] for <U+00A3>20&nbsp;million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the Board of Directors instead.<ref name="knighton_bid"/>

Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising <U+00A3>6.7&nbsp;million),<ref>Dobson & Goddard (2004), p. 191.</ref> and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[British Sky Broadcasting]] Corporation. This resulted in the formation of ''Shareholders United Against Murdoch'' <U+2013> now the ''Manchester United Supporters' Trust'' <U+2013> who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any [[takeover#Hostile takeovers|hostile takeover]]. The Manchester United board accepted a <U+00A3>623&nbsp;million offer,<ref>Bose (2007), p. 157.</ref> but the takeover was blocked by the [[Competition Commission|Monopolies and Mergers Commission]] at the final hurdle in April 1999.<ref>Bose (2007), p. 175.</ref> A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, [[John Magnier]] and [[J. P. McManus]], who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse [[Rock of Gibraltar (horse)|Rock of Gibraltar]], Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.<ref>Bose (2007), pp. 234<U+2013>235.</ref>

In May 2005, [[Malcolm Glazer]] purchased the 28.7&nbsp;percent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately <U+00A3>800&nbsp;million (then approx. $1.5&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4550141.stm |title=Glazer Man Utd stake exceeds 75% |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2007 }}</ref><ref name="new_owner">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/malcolm_glazer.html |title=Manchester United's new owner |publisher=CBC Sports (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=22 June 2005 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}</ref> In July 2006, the club announced a <U+00A3>660&nbsp;million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30&nbsp;percent reduction in annual interest payments to <U+00A3>62&nbsp;million a year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/archive/archive_2006_jul_08.htm |title=Glazers Tighten Grip On United With Debt Refinancing |work=The Political Economy of Football |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2008 }}</ref><ref name="refinancing">{{cite news |title=Manchester United reveal refinancing plans |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2006/0718/manunited2.html |publisher=RT<U+00C9> (Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann)|date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}</ref> In January 2010, with debts of <U+00A3>716.5&nbsp;million ($1.17&nbsp;billion),<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester United debt hits <U+00A3>716m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8470595.stm |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}</ref> Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth <U+00A3>504&nbsp;million, enabling them to pay off most of the <U+00A3>509&nbsp;million owed to international banks.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester United to raise <U+00A3>500m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8451848.stm |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}</ref> The annual interest payable on the bonds <U+2013> which mature on 1 February 2017 <U+2013> is approximately <U+00A3>45&nbsp;million per annum.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Wilson |title=Manchester United raise <U+00A3>504m in bond issue |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8475317.stm |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}</ref> Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's [[Trafford Training Centre]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hughes |title=Man Utd 4<U+2013>0 Hull |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8472354.stm |work=BBC Sport  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Prime Minister Gordon Brown warns football over debts |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8479331.stm |work=BBC Sport  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}</ref> Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath.

==Honours==
Manchester United's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which it won as Newton Heath in 1886.<ref>Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 8.</ref> In 1908, the club won its first league title, and won the [[FA Cup]] for the first time the following year. In terms of the number of trophies won, Manchester United's most successful decade was the 1990s; the club won five league titles, four FA Cups, one [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], five [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shields]] (one shared), one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], one [[UEFA Super Cup]] and one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]].

The club currently holds the record for most top-division titles (19), the most FA Cups (11), and the most [[FA Cup Final]] appearances (18).<ref>{{cite web |title=Cup Final Results |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults |work=TheFA.com |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=22 January 2011 }}</ref> Manchester United holds the record for the most Premier League titles (12), and was the first English team to win the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1968. The club's most recent trophy came in August 2011 with the [[2011 FA Community Shield]] title.

The only major honour that Manchester United has never won is the [[UEFA Europa League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Club/Trophy-Room.aspx |title=Trophy Room |accessdate=3 December 2010 |publisher=ManUtd.com (Manchester United) }}</ref> although the team reached the quarter-finals in 1984<U+2013>85 and the semi-finals of the competition's precursor tournament, the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], in 1964<U+2013>65.<ref>{{cite web |first=James|last=Ross|date=9 January 2008| url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec198485.html#uefa |title=European Competitions 1984<U+2013>85 |accessdate=24 June 2010 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196465det.html#fc |title=Fairs' Cup 1964<U+2013>65 |accessdate=15 February 2009 |last1=Zea |first1=Antonio |last2=Haisma |first2=Marcel |date=9 January 2008 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref>
