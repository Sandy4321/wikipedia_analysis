'''Lauren Kaye Ebsary''' (born 15 March 1983) is an [[Australia]]n [[cricket]]er. Primarily a [[batsman]], she is a current member of the [[Australia national women's cricket team]].

Ebsary made her senior debut for [[South Australian Scorpions|South Australia]] in the [[Women's National Cricket League]] (WNCL) during the 2000&ndash;01 season at the age of 18. Although she played in every match in her first season, she was shielded from much of the action and made only six runs. Ebsary was selected in every match in her first three seasons, but in that time, scored only 136 runs at a [[batting average]] of 8.50 and took 13 wickets from 24 matches. The following year, Ebsary raised her career average above 10 for the first time and was selected in the Australian Under-23 team. In 2004&ndash;05 she made more than 100 runs in a season for the first time, and the following year she made 149 runs at 29.80. In 2006&ndash;07, she struggled and totalled only 101 runs at 14.42 and took three wickets, and after the season she transferred to [[Western Fury|Western Australia]]. The change of state yielded dividends in the 2007&ndash;08 season, as she made 236 runs and took eight wickets, her highest aggregate of runs and wickets in one tournament.

At the start of the 2008&ndash;09 season, Ebsary gained selection to the Australian national team and made her [[One Day International]] (ODI) debut in the home series against [[India national women's cricket team|India]]. She made 37 runs at 18.50, and after scoring 207 runs in the WNCL season, was retained in the national team. After making her ODI top-score of 86 in the [[Rose Bowl series]] against [[New Zealand national women's cricket team|New Zealand]], she was selected for the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup|2009 World Cup]], but was in and out of the team, making 106 runs at 35.33. In June 2009, she played in all of Australia's matches at the [[2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20|2009 World Twenty20]] and made her [[Test cricket|Test debut]] against [[England women's cricket team|England]] in a bilateral series after the World Twenty20. Ebsary scored 211 runs during the 2009&ndash;10 WNCL season to retain her position in the national squad for the Rose Bowl series, but after a series of poor performances, she spent the latter half of the campaign watching from the sidelines.

== Early years ==

Born in [[Snowtown, South Australia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/player/53682.html|title=Lauren Ebsary player profile|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> Lauren Ebsary was one of four children&mdash;two boys and two girls&mdash;of Peter and Kaye Ebsary.<ref name=debut/> While pursuing her secondary education at [[Snowtown, South Australia|Snowtown Area School]], attended a cricket coaching clinic organised by her school in 1996. It was there that her talent was noticed by Australian [[Test cricket|Test player]] and development officer for the [[South Australian Cricket Association]] (SACA) [[Joanne Broadbent]],<ref name=debut/> who said that Ebsary "had a lot of potential from the start".<ref name=debut/> After Ebsary made her debut for Australia, Broadbent said "I<U+2019>ve always believed Lauren had the capacity to represent her country."<ref name=debut/> Ebsary was initially a tall and gangly [[fast bowling|pace bowler]] who mixed testing deliveries with erratic ones, including many [[wide (cricket)|wides]].<ref name=debut/> 

During her teenage years before she acquired a driver's licence, Ebsary's mother drove her to the state capital, [[Adelaide]]&mdash;more than 100&nbsp;km away&mdash;to play for the [[Flinders University|Flinders University Cricket Club]] in SACA's district women's competition on weekends.<ref name=debut/> Back in Snowtown, she practiced against her father and one of her brothers.<ref name=debut/> In 1997&ndash;98 she attended the state under-17s trials and was successful in gaining selection at the age of 14. Due to the lack of opportunities to females to play cricket at local youth level, she played her first competitive game at the national championships in [[Brisbane]].<ref name=debut/>

In January 2000, at the age of 16, Ebsary was chosen for the South Australian team for the Under-19 interstate championships. Playing as a specialist [[batsman]]&mdash;she bowled a solitary [[wicket]]less [[over (cricket)|over]] in six matches&mdash;she did not failed to pass five in her first five matches, before scoring an [[not out|unbeaten]] 34 in the final match against Tasmania. Nevertheless, it was not a successful tournament, yielding 45 [[run (cricket)|runs]] at a [[batting average]] of 9.00.<ref name=o/>

== Senior debut ==

Despite the lack of success at youth interstate level, Ebsary was promoted into the senior South Australian team in the 2000&ndash;01 season at the age of 17,<ref name=debut/> playing in all of her state's eight matches in the [[Women's National Cricket League]] (WNCL).<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl00>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2000-01_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2000-01.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2000/01 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> She made her debut against reigning champions [[New South Wales Breakers|New South Wales]],<ref name=o/><ref name=ss99>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstars.org.au/wcanl99.htm |title=WNCL 1999/2000 |publisher=[[Cricket Australia]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> and after not batting, took one [[wicket]] for the loss of six runs (1/6) from two [[over (cricket)|overs]] as South Australia lost by seven wickets. In the next match of the double-header the next day, she took 0/15 from two overs and was [[run out]] for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in her maiden senior innings in a 22-run loss.<ref name=o/> During the season, Ebsary often batted at the bottom of the order in a specialist bowler's position and thus rarely batted, but she hardly bowled, delivering only six overs in total in her first seven matches.<ref name=o/> In effect, she was shielded from taking on a meaningful workload and not trusted to contribute with either bat or ball. In the last match of the season, she was finally given a substantial opportunity against [[Queensland Fire|Queensland]], taking 3/21 from seven overs, as South Australia proceeded to a six-wicket victory. Nevertheless, in eight matches she scored only six runs at 2.00 in three innings, and took five wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 9.40 and an [[economy rate]] of 3.61.<ref name=o/> South Australia won only three matches and did not make the finals.<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl00/><ref name=ss00>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstars.org.au/wcanl00.htm |title=WNCL 2000/2001 |publisher=[[Cricket Australia]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref>

During the 2001&ndash;02 WNCL, Ebsary played in all eight matches,<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl01>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2001-02_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2001-02.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2001/02 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> and was given more responsibility. This season, she batted in seven innings and bowled 51 of a maximum possible 80 overs. In the first match of the season, she took 3/29 from 10 overs against the titleholders New South Wales,<ref name=o/><ref name=ss00/> and she scored 51 in the fifth match against [[Victorian Spirit|Victoria]]. Ebsary did not have a significant impact in the other matches, never taking more than one wicket per match or reaching double figures with the bat. She ended the season with 67 runs at 9.57 and six wickets at 30.83 at an economy rate of 3.62.<ref name=o/> South Australia won four of their eight matches and did not make the final.<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl01/><ref name=ss01>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstars.org.au/wcanl01.htm |title=WNCL 2000/2001 |publisher=[[Cricket Australia]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref>

Ebsary was 18 during the season and still eligible for the Under-19s and she represented her state during the tournament, which was held in the middle of a break in the WNCL.<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl01/> She scored 119 runs at 19.83 and took nine wickets at 15.55 with a best of 4/27 against the Australian Capital Territory.<ref name=o/> At the end of the season, Ebsary was chosen in the Australia Youth team to play New Zealand A and [[New Zealand national women's cricket team|New Zealand]]. In four matches she took two wickets at 32.00 at an economy rate of 2.66 but had no impact with the bat, scoring five runs at 1.66.<ref name=o/>
[[Image:Lauren Ebsary catch 2.jpg|Ebsary taking a one-handed catch at training.|thumb]]
In the 2002&ndash;03 WNCL, Ebsary played in all eight matches,<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl02>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2002-03_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2002-03.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2002/03 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> but was given less responsibility with the ball and had little success. She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34.00. She also had little effect with the bat, scoring 63 runs at 11.50 with a best score of 18.<ref name=o/> South Australia won five of their matches, narrowly missing the finals.<ref name=o/><ref name=ss02>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstars.org.au/wcanl02.htm |title=WNCL 2002/2003 |publisher=[[Cricket Australia]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> Up to this point her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8.37.<ref name=o/>

At the start of the 2003&ndash;04 season, Ebsary was chosen in an Australian Under-23 team that played a two-innings match against the touring [[England women's cricket team|England team]]. Ebsary scored nine [[not out]] and took 4/35 and 0/4 from a total of 20 overs.<ref name=o/> She was somewhat more successful in the WNCL than in previous years, bowling 28 overs and taking five wickets at 17.00 at an economy rate of 3.03 with a best of 2/19 in the last match of the season with Victoria. She scored 91 runs at 15.16, her highest season aggregate and average to date, with a best of 26.<ref name=o/> This brought Ebsary's career average above 10 for the first time.<ref name=o/> South Australia won four of their matches and another was washed out, failing to make the final.<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl03>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2003-04_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2003-04.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2003/04 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref><ref name=ss03>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstars.org.au/wcanl03.htm |title=WNCL 2003/2004 |publisher=[[Cricket Australia]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> She played in three matches for Australia Youth against New Zealand A at the end of the season, scoring 29 runs at 29.00 and taking three wickets at 16.66 at an economy rate of 4.54.<ref name=o/>

In 2004&ndash;05, Ebsary scored more than 100 runs in a WNCL season for the first time. She scored 125 runs at 20.83, averaging more than 20 for the first time in a season. Her best score of 36 not out came in a ten-wicket win over [[Western Fury|Western Australia]], and in the other match against the state the preceding day, she scored 28 and took 2/26 in a 29-run win. Her best bowling performance came in the first match of the season as she took 3/32 and scored 25 in a six-wicket win over Queensland. Ebsary ended the season with six wickets at 26.83. She bowled 37 overs and conceded 4.35 runs per over.<ref name=o/>

In the 2005&ndash;06 WNCL season, Ebsary struggled to make an impact with the ball, taking four wickets at 43.00 at the relatively high economy rate of 4.91. Her figures were flattered by a haul of 3/32 in the final match of the season against Western Australia, in which she also made 26 to help seal a three-wicket win. Her batting continued to progress; she scored 149 runs at 29.80, including a best of 43 against Victoria. South Australia won five of their eight matches, again missing the finals.<ref name=o/><ref name=wncl04>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2004-05_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2004-05.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2004/05 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref><ref name=ss04>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernstars.org.au/wcanl04.htm |title=WNCL 2004/2005 |publisher=[[Cricket Australia]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref>

Ebsary had more difficult times in the 2006&ndash;07 WNCL season. She took only three wickets at 60.33 and an economy rate of 5.14, the worst average and economy rate she had recorded for a WNCL season. She never took more than one wicket in any match. Her batting also regressed, making 101 runs at 14.42, more than half coming in a 51 against New South Wales in the last match of the season.<ref name=o/> This was Ebsary's last season for her native state as she moved to Western Australia for the 2007&ndash;08 season.<ref name=o/>

== Move to Western Australia ==

The transfer coincided with a upturn in Ebsary's career. After a slow start in the new WNCL season&mdash;Western Australia lost their first five matches<ref name=o/>&mdash;Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made consecutive [[century (cricket)|half-centuries]] for the first time in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissals]] were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons.<ref name=o/> Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling [[Twenty20]] format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket.<ref name=o/> Ebsary later said "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of [[Avril Fahey]], the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order."<ref name=debut>{{cite web |url=http://www.northernargus.com.au/news/local/sport/general/lauren-debuts-for-australia/1364532.aspx |title=Lauren debuts for Australia |author=Argent, Peter |date=2008-11-19 |publisher=[[Northern Argus]] |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>

== International debut ==
[[Image:Lauren Ebsary catch.jpg|Ebsary taking a two-handed catch at training.|thumb]]
Ebsary was rewarded with international selection for the five-match [[One Day International]] ODI series against India at the start of the 2008&ndash;09 Australian season.<ref name=o/> Nerve damage in her toe ruled Ebsary out of contention for the first match at [[Hurstville Oval]], which the hosts won by eight wickets with more than 12 overs to spare.<ref name=debut/><ref name=auslistw/> The next day, she was given her debut in the second match of the series, at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Ebsary made five not out as the hosts made 6/215 batting first. Ebsary came in at 6/194 with 14 balls remaining in the Australia innings.<ref name=dsc/> She took a single off each of the five balls she faced, [[List of cricket terms#S|rotating the strike]] as her partner [[Lisa Sthalekar]] completed an unbeaten century.<ref name=debut/><ref name=o/> In the seventh over of India's reply, Ebsary's throw from the boundary [[run out|ran out]] [[Jaya Sharma]] as the opener attempted to take a third run, leaving the tourists at 2/9.<ref name=debut/><ref name=dsc>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england/engine/match/369329.html|title=2nd ODI: Australia Women v India Women at Sydney, Nov 1, 2008|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=4 July 2009}}</ref>

Bowling in the middle of the innings, she then took 1/17 from five overs, her maiden wicket being [[Thirush Kamini]] caught behind by wicket-keeper [[Jodie Fields]] for one run, leaving India at 5/71 in the 26th over.<ref name=dsc/> She then claimed two catches to complete the eighth and ninth wickets&mdash;those of tail-enders [[Amita Sharma]] and [[Nooshin Al Khader]]&mdash;as Australia won by 86 runs.<ref name=dsc/> Ebsary went on to play in the last four matches of the series.

In the WNCL, Ebsary went wicketless for the entire season for the first time, conceding 127 runs at an economy rate of 4.70.

[[Image:Lauren Ebsary bowling.jpg|Ebsary bowling in the nets at training.|thumb]]
Despite her inability to take a wicket in the WNCL, Ebsary was retained in the national team and in the next five months of international cricket, she did not bowl a ball.<ref name=o/> Ahead of the 2009 World Cup, the Australians headed to [[New Zealand]] for a [[Rose Bowl series]], Ebsary was left out of the first two ODIs against [[New Zealand national women's cricket team|New Zealand]], but was recalled for the next two matches at [[Seddon Park]] in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref name=o/><ref name=auslistw/> She scored 30 from 47 balls in the first match before making her ODI top-score of 86 the next day. Batting at No. 3, she struck nine boundaries and faced only 76 balls, scoring at faster than a run-a-ball.<ref name=odi/> This helped set up Australia's 4/307 and they went on to win by 44 runs, their second consecutive victory.<ref name=o/><ref name=auslistw/> The teams returned to Australia where Ebsary made her T20 international debut at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. She did not bat or bowl in a rain-affected Australian win.<ref name=o/><ref name=auslistw2/>

In two warm-up matches ahead of the World Cup in Australia, Ebsary made 18 and 8 against [[England women's cricket team|England]] and [[Sri Lanka national women's cricket team|Sri Lanka]] respectively.<ref name=o/> Nevertheless, Ebsary was retained for the match against New Zealand, scoring one at No. 7 as Australia failed in their run-chase.<ref name=o/><ref name=odi/> It was the start of a tournament in which Ebsary was moved around in the Australian team structure. Ebsary was dropped for the second match against [[South Africa national women's cricket team|South Africa]], which Australia won, and recalled for the last group match against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. She made 15 from 28 balls at No. 5,<ref name=odi/> in a 47-run win to reach the next round. In the first Super Six match, Ebsary made 39 not out from 36 balls at No. 7 in the closing stages of the game,<ref name=odi/> attempting to hold together the Australian lower-order as they fell 16 runs short of India's 5/234. She was then promoted to No. 3 in the following match, making 51 from 71 balls against [[Pakistan national women's cricket team|Pakistan]] after [[Leah Poulton]] and [[Shelley Nitschke]] had put on a century opening stand, as the Australians completed a 107-run win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/357972.html|title=16th Match, Super Six: Australia Women v Pakistan Women at Sydney, Mar 16, 2009|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=4 July 2009}}</ref> Ebsary was left out of the final Super Six match against England, which Australia won,<ref name=o/><ref name=auslistw/> which was not enough for them to reach the final.

Ebsary was selected for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009. The Australians hosted New Zealand for a three-match series in tropical [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] at the beginning of June before the World Cup, and Ebsary made 17.00 at 8.50 in her three innings.<ref name=o/><ref name=auslistw2/> She then made 13 in the team's warm-up match on English soil, against the hosts, but was nevertheless retained for all the matches. She made a duck as Australia lost their opening match against New Zealand, and was not required to bat in the win over the West Indies. Ebsary made 23 run out in the final group match as Australia defeated South Africa to reach the semi-finals. There she scored eight not out before England overhauled Australia's score to reach the final, which they won.<ref name=o/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wwt202010/content/story/454176.html| title=England women announce T20 squad |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2010-04-20|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> She ended the tournament with 44 runs at 22.00.<ref name=o/>

Ebsary stayed in England for a bilateral series against the hosts, who were the reigning world champions in both ODIs and T20s, after the end of the World Twenty20. She scored 24 not out as Australia upset England in the only T20 by 34 runs. She played in all of the five ODIs, and after making 23, 38 and 40, her form tapered away in the last two matches, making single-figure scores to end with 112 runs at 22.40.<ref name=o/> Batting in a variety of positions from No. 5 to 8, she scored quickly at a strike rate of 88.18.<ref name=odi/> In the fourth match, she took 1/16, the first time she had bowled in 19 international matches,<ref name=o/> removing [[Claire Taylor]].<ref name=ow/> England won all the matches except the last, which was washed out.<ref name=o/> 

Ebsary made her Test debut against England in a one-off match at [[County Road]] in [[Worcestershire]]. Australia batted first and Ebsary came to the crease at No. 9 with the total on 7/271. She scored 3 from 15 balls before being trapped [[leg before wicket]] by [[Katherine Brunt]], as Australia were dismissed for 309. She then took 2/35. She claimed her maiden Test wicket by having Taylor caught by Poulton for 10 and then had [[Jenny Gunn]] caught behind by [[Jodie Fields]] for 41.<ref name=dt/> This ended a 77-run partnership with [[Beth Morgan (cricketer)|Beth Morgan]] and left the hosts at 6/136 but they recovered to reach 268, still enough for Australia to take a 41-run lead.<ref name=o/><ref name=ow/> Ebsary was then promoted to No. 4 and made 21 as Australia set the hosts a target of 273 before the match was drawn.<ref name=o/><ref name=dt>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/204/204506.html |title=England Women v Australia Women |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref>

The WNCL was expanded in 2009&ndash;10 with the addition of the [[ACT Meteors|Australian Capital Territory]], so ten round-robin matches were scheduled, and Ebsary played in all, scoring 211 runs at 21.10.<ref name=wncl08>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2008-09_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2008-09.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2008/09 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref><ref name=wncl09>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2009-10_AUS_Womens_National_Cricket_League_2009-10.html |title=Women's National Cricket League 2009/10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> After being wicketless the previous season, she took seven wickets at 31.28, although opposition batsmen did attack her bowling, scoring 5.17 runs per over.<ref name=o/> Her best batting and bowling performances came in the same match against her native state, taking 3/37 from nine overs to help dismiss them for 191 before scoring 48 to help secure a two-wicket win.<ref name=o/> In the last two matches of the season, she scored 43 and 42 in consecutive wins over Queensland.<ref name=o/>

Ebsary had a successful time in the domestic T20s, now part of a full interstate tournament instead of a series of one-off matches,<ref name=wt208>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2009-10_AUS_Australian_Womens_Twenty20_Cup_2009-10.html |title=Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup 2009/10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref><ref name=wt209>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/2008-09_AUS_Womens_Interstate_Twenty20_2008-09.html |title=Women's Interstate Twenty20 Cup 2008/09 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> scoring 137 runs at 22.83 and taking four wickets at 26.25 at an economy rate of 7.50.<ref name=o/> Her best score of 41 came in a win over [[Tasmanian Roar|Tasmania]] and she also scored 29 and took 2/14 in a win over the Australian Capital Territory.<ref name=o>{{cite web| title=Player Oracle LK Ebsary |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=12298&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Meckiff&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>

Ebsary was retained for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand and played in the first four ODIs in Australia.
