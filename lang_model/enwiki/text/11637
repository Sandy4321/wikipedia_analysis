==Album Information==
Vissi started working on her Greek album in summer 2008.  In an interview with ''Down Town Magazine'' in [[July]] 2008, Vissi said that she feels like she did at the start of her career, having already listened to over 600 songs in the studio in an attempt to find songs she likes. She also stated that this would be the first album that [[Nikos Karvelas]] will contribute any songs to.  The reason she gave for this was that the two have gotten tired of each other, but clarified that this does not rule out a collaboration in the future. On October 29, 2008, the song ''To Parelthon Mou'' was released.  The song is the title track from the Greek film ''Bank Bang'', due out in December 2008.  On October 30, 2008, Vissi gave an interview on [[MAD TV (Greece)|MAD TV]]'s ''OK'' with Themis Georgandidis.

Among the composers, will be Giannis Kifonidis with 3 songs, Giannis Hristoudoulopoulos with 3 songs, and [[Patrick Leonard]] with 3 songs also.

A song by [[Glenn Ballard]] and [[Christina Aguilara]] will also be included in Greek on the album as "An Se Erotefto".  Originally written in English as "That's what love can do", Agularia never released the song publicly, and it will be included on Vissi's English album.
