'''David Wright Miliband''' <!-- Do ''not'' insert 'PC' for Privy Councillor. Only peers receive the postnominals 'PC' since they are styled 'The Right Honourable' whether or not they are Privy Councillors. --> (born 15 July 1965) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]], and was the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] from 2007 to 2010. He is the son of the late [[Marxist]] theorist [[Ralph Miliband]]. He and his younger brother, [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Ed Miliband]], were the first siblings to sit in the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] simultaneously since [[Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (1894-1938)|Edward, Lord Stanley]], and [[Oliver Stanley]] in 1938. 

Born in London, Miliband studied at [[Oxford University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and started his career at the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]]. At 29, Miliband became [[Tony Blair]]'s Head of Policy whilst the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was in opposition and was a major contributor to Labour's manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] which brought the party to power. Blair made him head of the Prime Minister's Policy Unit from 1997 to 2001, following which Miliband was elected to parliament for the [[North East England]] seat of [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]].

Miliband spent the next few years in various junior ministerial posts, including at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]], before becoming [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]]. His tenure in this post saw [[climate change]] consolidated as a priority for UK policymakers. On the succession of [[Gordon Brown]] as [[Prime Minister of the UK|Prime Minister]], Miliband was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], at 41, the youngest person to hold the post since [[David Owen]] 30 years earlier. In September 2010 Miliband narrowly lost the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|Labour leadership election]] to his brother Ed. On 29 September 2010, he announced that to avoid "constant comparison" with his brother Ed, and because of the "perpetual, distracting and destructive attempts to find division where there is none, and splits where they don't exist, all to the detriment of the party's cause", he would not stand for the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|shadow cabinet]].<ref name="Mulholland-29-09-2010">{{cite news|last=Mulholland|first=H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne |title=David Miliband quits frontline politics|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/29/david-miliband-quits-frontline-politics|accessdate=29 September 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2010-09-29 | location=London}}</ref>

It was announced in January 2010 that Miliband will take up the position of Vice-Chairman at [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.]], with his role specifying in his charity work and [[ambassador]]ial work.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Political biography==
Miliband's first job was for the [[National Council for Voluntary Organisations]]. From 1989 to 1994, he worked as a Research Fellow and [[policy analysis|policy analyst]] at the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] (IPPR). He was appointed Secretary of the IPPR's Commission on Social Justice upon its foundation in 1992 by the then leader of the Labour Party, [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Commission on Social Justice |url = http://www.ippr.org/ipprcommissions/index.asp?id=2378 |publisher = IPPR |accessdate = 3 August 2008 }}</ref>
In 1994 Miliband became [[Tony Blair]]'s Head of Policy and was a major contributor to Labour's manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. After Labour's victory in that election, Blair made him the de facto Head of the Prime Minister's Policy Unit, a position which he held until the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]]. He was given the nickname "[[Brains (Thunderbirds)|Brains]]" by [[Alastair Campbell]], after the ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' character.<ref name="Heir to Blair?"/> In the 2001 general election he was elected to Parliament for the Labour stronghold of [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]]. After a year as a [[backbench]] MP he was appointed Schools Minister, a [[junior minister]] in the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] in June 2002. On 15 December 2004, in the reshuffle following the resignation of [[David Blunkett]], he replaced [[Ruth Kelly]] as a [[Cabinet Office Minister]].

Following Labour's third consecutive [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|election victory in May 2005]], he was promoted to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of State for Communities and Local Government]] within the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]. This was a newly created cabinet-level post with responsibility for housing, planning, regeneration and [[local government]]. Because the [[Deputy Prime Minister]], [[John Prescott]], was the [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|Departmental Minister]] officially in charge of these portfolios, Miliband was not given the title [[Secretary of State]] but he was appointed a [[Privy Councillor]] and became a full member of the Cabinet.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page76.asp#m | title = Privy Council Members | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}</ref>

===Secretary of State at Defra===
On 5 May 2006 following the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|local elections]] Tony Blair made a major [[cabinet reshuffle]] in which Miliband replaced [[Margaret Beckett]] as [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=5 May 2006 | title = Reshuffle seeks to rejuvenate | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4976428.stm | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2007-05-02 | first=Nick | last=Assinder}}</ref> Miliband has said he believes agriculture is important for the UK<U+2019>s cultural heritage, economy and society and also for the environment. He has said disease control should be balanced with [[animal welfare]]. He attaches importance to reaching a <U+201C>fair balance<U+201D> among consumers, farmers, manufacturers and retailers. Miliband also believes the [[European Union]] and the [[World Trade Organisation]] affect power relations between British and foreign farmers.<ref>{{cite web|date=4 July 2006 | title = Speech by the Rt Hon.

He was the first British cabinet member to have a [[blog]], though claims of excessive cost to the taxpayer provoked some controversy.<ref>{{Cite news|date= 16 June 2006 | title = <U+00A3>40,000 - the real cost of reading David's diary | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/people/pandora/article1089241.ece | publisher = The Independent | accessdate = 2006-07-27 | location=London | first=Henry | last=Deedes}} {{cite web|date=16 June 2006 | title = Written Parliamentary Question on cost of blog | url = http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060616/text/60616w1003.htm#06061625000057 | publisher = Hansard | accessdate = 2006-09-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060825210534/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060616/text/60616w1003.htm#06061625000057 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-08-25}}</ref> In January 2007 Miliband sparked minor controversy by saying there was no evidence [[organic food]] was better than [[conventionally grown]] produce, though he later clarified that he was referring specifically to health benefits.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 January 2007 | title = Miliband questions organic quality | url = http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200701/0a0b11d2-2dbf-43a8-9fa2-5e497e617142.htm | publisher = ePolitix.com | accessdate = 2007-05-02}} See also: {{cite web|date=8 January 2007 | title = Making the Most of Organic Food | url = http://www.davidmiliband.defra.gov.uk/blogs/ministerial_blog/archive/2007/01/08/4320.aspx | publisher = Defra | accessdate = 2007-05-02}}</ref>

Miliband is an advocate for international awareness of [[climate change]] and believes the cooperation of all nations is needed for environmental reform. Miliband's focuses include food retail waste management and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in agricultural industries. He believes that the [[EU]] should go further in two areas: a low carbon global economy and global action on climate change. He also wants Europe to increase its economic competitiveness. By switching over to a low carbon economy, he plans to tackle climate change. He hopes to ensure a stable price on energy by securing an energy source and announced the Government's plans to legislate for carbon reductions at the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/speeches/david-miliband/dm070606.htm|first=David |last=Miliband|title=Greening the American Dream|date=6 June 2007}} See also: {{ UN document |docid=A-62-PV.9 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=62 |meeting=9 |page=45 |anchor=pg045-bk02-pa21 |date=27 September 2007 |speakername=Mr. Miliband | speakernation=United Kingdom |accessdate=2007-11-12 }}</ref>

In August 2006, in an effort to put environmental reform into action, Miliband developed a place for a collaborative "environmental contract" to be developed on a [[Defra]] Wiki site. It was subsequently linked to by blogger [[Paul Staines]], and mocked, after which further edits by guest users were temporarily prevented.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 November 2006 | title = Wiki Wickedness | url = http://5thnovember.blogspot.com/2006/09/wiki-wickedness.html | publisher = Global & General Nominees LLC | accessdate = 2006-09-01}}</ref> Miliband's emphasis on the necessity of an entirely cooperative effort to effectively instigate a low carbon lifestyle worldwide has led him to advocate an open dialogue among citizens about environmental issues through web-based blogging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/|title=Defra website}}</ref> Whilst Environment Secretary, Miliband called for all 27 nations of the [[European Union]] to unify in backing proposals to cut harmful emissions by 30% by 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6369171.stm|title='Now or never' for climate action | work=BBC News | date=18 February 2007 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref>

Miliband has floated the idea of every citizen being issued with a "Carbon Credit Card" to improve personal carbon thrift. Miliband claims individuals have to be empowered to tackle [[global warming]] <U+2014> "the mass mobilising movement of our age".<ref>{{Cite news|date=11 December 2006 | title = Carbon 'credit card' considered | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6167671.stm | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2007-05-02}}</ref>

===Foreign Secretary===
On 28 June 2007, the day after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, Miliband was appointed [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. He was Britain's third youngest Foreign Secretary and the youngest person to be appointed to the post since [[David Owen]] (in office 21 February 1977 <U+2013> 4 May 1979). [[Anthony Eden]] assumed office at the age of 37 in 1935. David's younger brother, the economist [[Ed Miliband]], was the [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]], making them the first siblings to serve together in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] since [[Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (1894-1938)|Edward, Lord Stanley]] and his brother [[Oliver Stanley|Oliver]] in 1938.

[[Image:Miliband Clinton.jpg|thumb|Miliband with [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], February 2009.]]

Miliband's first [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] questions session as Foreign Secretary in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] was on 3 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070703/debtext/70703-0002.htm |title=tso.co.uk |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref>
On the morning of 13 December 2007, Miliband stood in for Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]] at the official signing ceremony in [[Lisbon]] of the [[EU Reform Treaty]], which was attended by all other European heads of government. Brown was otherwise engaged at the House of Commons, appearing before the [[Liaison Committee]], and travelled to Portugal to sign the treaty in the afternoon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,,2227505,00.html|title=Miliband plays stand-in at lavish EU relaunch | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Ian | last=Traynor | date=14 December 2007 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

On 5 February 2009, Miliband made a statement to the House of Commons concerning [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainee and former British resident [[Benyam Mohammed]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2009-02-05a.989.0 |title=Miliband statement on [[Benyam Mohammed]] |date=5 February 2009 |publisher=TheyWorkForYou }}</ref> A week later Mohamed<U+2019>s American lawyer Yvonne Bradley flew to Britain to urge the Foreign Office to press harder for his release.

====India trip====
After his trip to India in 2008 following the [[Mumbai attacks]], Miliband wrote in an article that "resolution of the dispute over [[Kashmir]] would help deny extremists in the region one of their main calls to arms, and allow [[Pakistan]]i authorities to focus more effectively on tackling the threat on their western borders".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/15/david-miliband-war-terror |title=David Miliband: 'War on terror' was wrong | Comment is free | The Guardian |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-15 | location=London | date=15 January 2009}}</ref> This sparked an angry response from the [[Indian government]], whose long standing policy had been not to accept any third party involvement in the [[dispute of Kashmir]]. An Indian analyst suggested that his tone implied that India must shoulder some of the responsibility because of its policies in Kashmir.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Kapil Komireddi|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/23/india-kashmir |title=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-03-16 | location=London | date=23 January 2009}}</ref> Some reports also said that Miliband's tone towards the Indian Prime Minister and the Finance Minister had been aggressive, and that he had been excused for being a "young man".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/milibands-trip-to-india-a-disaster-after-kashmir-gaffe-1418914.html |title=The Independent |publisher=The Independent |date=2009-01-18 |accessdate=2010-03-16 | location=London | first=Jane | last=Merrick}}</ref>

====Sri Lanka ceasefire====
During the latter stages of the [[Sri Lankan Army]]'s [[2008<U+2013>2009 SLA Northern offensive|2008/09 offensive]] against the [[LTTE]], Miliband travelled to [[Sri Lanka]] to press the [[Sri Lankan government|government]] to call a ceasefire with the [[Tamil Tigers]], citing concerns for civilians caught in the crossfire.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6174544.ece|title=David Miliband heads to Sri Lanka to urge ceasefire | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Jeremy | last1=Page | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> Miliband's visit was met with protests by Sri Lankan nationalists, who accused Miliband of attempting to save the lives of Tamil Tiger militants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_370219.html|title=Monks protest Miliband visit}}</ref> During the [[End of the Sri Lankan Civil War|victory]] celebrations that took place a few weeks later, a burning effigy of Miliband was reported to have been tossed over the gate of the British [[High Commission]] in [[Colombo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6310422.ece|title=Effigy of David Miliband burnt on streets of Sri Lankan capital | location=London}}</ref>

====Comments over terrorism====
In August 2009, Miliband was a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Great Lives]]'' programme, choosing [[South African Communist Party]] leader and anti-[[apartheid]] activist [[Joe Slovo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lyfm8 |title=Radio 4 Programmes - Great Lives, Series 19, Joe Slovo |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref> Miliband stated during the programme, in a response to a question about terrorism, that "yes there are circumstances in which it is justifiable and yes there are circumstances in which it is effective, but it is never effective on its own". These comments were criticised by [[Menzies Campbell]] and [[William Hague]].<ref>{{Cite news|author=H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Mulholland and agencies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/aug/17/miliband-terrorism-menzies-campbell |title=Miliband attacked over terrorism comments |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=2010-03-16 | location=London | date=17 August 2009}}</ref>

====European Foreign Minister====
The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] creates the post of [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] for the [[European Union]], a post commonly known as the European Foreign Minister. In autumn 2009, as the treaty came close to coming into force, Miliband was named as being under consideration for the post as EU officials regarded him as "ideal material".<ref name="EU Foreign Minister">{{Cite news|newspaper=Sunday Telegraph |author=Patrick Hennessy, Bruno Waterfield |title=... or it could be Miliband, the EU international overlord |date=11 October 2009  |page=8 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20869193.html }}{{registration required}}</ref> Miliband publicly insisted that he was not available to fill the post, as he was committed to remaining in the British cabinet.<ref name="Not available">{{Cite news|newspaper=The Independent |first=Nigel |last=Morris |title=Miliband 'will stay in government' |date=2 November 2009 |page=8 }}{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}</ref> [[Catherine Ashton|Baroness Ashton]], a fellow British Labour politician and then [[European Commissioner for Trade]], was ultimately appointed to the post instead.<ref>{{Cite news

====Relations with Israel====
On 23 March 2010, the UK expelled an [[Israel]]i diplomat owing to claims that an embassy official from that country forged passports, and Miliband gave a public warning against travel to [[Israel]] because of identity theft concerns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100323/ap_on_re_eu/eu_britain_dubai_slaying

==Labour Party==
Miliband has emphasised a generational division between himself and [[Blairism|Blairites]] such as [[John Reid (politician)|John Reid]], [[Alan Milburn]], [[Stephen Byers]], [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]] and [[Peter Mandelson]]. Miliband is one of the "[[Primrose Hill]] Gang", a loose network of younger Labour politicians and advisers who supposedly look beyond Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for the future of the Labour Party. Other members of the group include Miliband's brother [[Ed Miliband]], [[Douglas Alexander]], [[Pat McFadden (British politician)|Pat McFadden]], [[James Purnell]], [[Jim Murphy]], [[Andy Burnham]], [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Matthew Taylor]], [[Geoff Mulgan]] and [[Patrick Diamond]].

Miliband could be seen as a leader of a different set of "next generation" Blairite Ministers - a "Blairites for Brown" group - whom political commentators usually identify as David Miliband, [[Andy Burnham]], [[James Purnell]] and [[Liam Byrne]], several of whom have already prospered under Brown. There is reported to be little difference between this group and [[Brownism|Brownites]] of the same generation, notably Ed Miliband, and the husband and wife ministerial couple of [[Ed Balls]] and [[Yvette Cooper]].

Miliband's support for Brown has been seen as an effort among his generation to prevent the Blairite/Brownite division continuing, as some Labour Party members see this division as having been more a product of historical personal rivalries arising from the 1994 leadership deal, rather than limited policy differences over public services. Political commentator [[Andrew Rawnsley]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote in 2002 that "He is on the Left of the New Labour spectrum. He is a believer<U+2014>in a way that Blair is not entirely<U+2014>in Continental [[social democracy]]".<ref name="Heir to Blair?">{{Cite news|date= 20 October 2002 | authorlink=Andrew Rawnsley | title = Heir to Blair? | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,815389,00.html | publisher = The Observer | accessdate = 2007-05-03 | location=London}}</ref>

==2010 Labour Party leadership election==
{{Main|Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010}}

===Background===
On 29 July 2008, Miliband wrote an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that outlined his vision of a future of the Labour Party but made no mention of Gordon Brown.<ref>{{Cite news|date=July 29, 2008|title=Against all odds we can still win, on a platform for change|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 August 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Miliband}}</ref> The piece was widely interpreted as a leadership challenge to the then Prime Minister, not least because the timing of its publication <U+2013> just after Brown's departure on holiday at the start of the parliamentary summer recess, and while there was intense speculation about his continuing leadership following Labour's defeat in the [[Glasgow East by-election, 2008|Glasgow East by-election]] the previous week <U+2013> seemed designed to produce a large political impact. In the following days two Labour MPs called on Brown to sack Miliband for his perceived disloyalty. Miliband, while denying claims by his detractors that he was seeking to provoke an early leadership election, did not rule himself out of eventually running for the leadership of the party. Many grassroots supporters believed a David Miliband-led Labour Party would tackle the Conservatives more effectively, reaching out to voters in marginal seats as well as securing Labour's core support.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/Internal_ReutersCoUkService_14/idUKADD02799420080731|title=Miliband calms leadership talk|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-08-02 | date=31 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=30 September 2008 | title = Miliband denies 'leadership' bid | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7532691.stm | publisher = bbc.co.uk | accessdate = 2008-08-02}}</ref>

====Campaign====
On 12 May 2010, flanked by 15 supportive MPs outside the House of Commons, Miliband announced he would stand for the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership election of the Labour Party]].<ref name=leaderguardian>{{Cite news|author=Allegra Stratton, political correspondent |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/12/labourleadership-labour |title=David Miliband announces Labour leadership bid &#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 12 May 2010|accessdate=2010-06-07 | location=London}}</ref> The other contenders for the leadership were [[Ed Balls]], [[Andy Burnham]], [[Diane Abbott]] and David<U+2019>s brother [[Ed Miliband]], with David Miliband gaining the most nominations. The result of the contest was announced on 25 September 2010, the day before the start of the 2010 [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] in Manchester. While David Miliband won the most first preference votes and the largest share of the vote in all rounds except the last, he lost (50.65% to 49.35%) to his brother Ed. He announced on 29 September 2010 that he would be quitting frontline politics and would not be a part of his brother Ed's shadow cabinet.<ref>H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Mulholland [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/29/david-miliband-quits-frontline-politics "David Miliband quits frontline politics",] ''The Guardian'', 29 September 2010</ref>

The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', a Labour supporting newspaper which had backed Miliband in his leadership campaign, lamented his failure to win as a "sad waste of a huge talent".<ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/09/30/sad-waste-of-a-huge-talent-115875-22596933/]</ref>

==Expenses claims==
{{Main|United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal}}

The ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'''s investigation of expenses claims by Members of Parliament reported that Miliband had claimed for [[gardening]] expenses and approximately <U+00A3>30,000 in repairs, decorations, and furnishings for his constituency home in [[South Shields]]. A spokesperson said: "At every stage, David Miliband followed the procedures and rules as laid out by the parliamentary authorities".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5293729/David-Miliband-challenged-by-gardener-MPs-expenses.html |title=Daily Telegraph: David Miliband |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2009-05-13 | location=London}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Miliband is married to United States-born Louise Shackelton, a professional violinist currently with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>[http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/features_details.cfm?News_id=26479 Miliband makes his mark]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}, Vivienne Russell, ''www.PublicFinance.co.uk''</ref> Shackelton and Miliband have adopted two newborn sons from the United States.<ref>http://www.davidmiliband.net/about-david-2/davids-story/</ref> the first in December 2004 and the second in October 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|date=31 December 2004 | author=Andrew Norfolk | title=Blair's lieutenant adopts American baby | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article407171.ece | publisher=The Times | accessdate=2007-05-15 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date= 29 October 2007 | title = David Miliband adopts second son | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7067282.stm | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate = 2007-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=David Miliband speaks of adopting his sons | last=Clout | first=Laura | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2120096/David-Miliband-speaks-of-adopting-his-sons.html | date=13 June 2008 | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | accessdate=2010-05-11 | location=London}}</ref>  

In an interview with [[CNN]] in 2009, Miliband stated that he grew up in a [[secular]] setting, and describes himself as an [[atheist]] with a "huge respect" for people of faith.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

==Business interests==
On 21 December 2010, The Office of David Miliband Limited was formed with Miliband and his wife Louise as directors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/30a0a493168a75322381e16a115f7cdf/compdetails/|title=Companies House website}}</ref>
