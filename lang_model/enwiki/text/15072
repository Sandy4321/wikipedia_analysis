<!-- Biographical details -->
Born and educated in Russia, Rand emigrated to the United States in 1926. She worked as a screenwriter in [[Hollywood]] and had a play produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935-1936. She first achieved fame with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943),<ref>{{cite book |last=Beetz |first=Kirk |title=Beacham's Encyclopedia of Popular Fiction |publisher=Beacham Pub |location=Osprey, Florida |year=1996 |isbn=0-933833-41-5 |page=1516}}</ref> and her best-known work <U+2013> the [[philosophical novel]] ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' <U+2013> was published in 1957.

<!-- Philosophical views -->
Rand's political views, reflected in both her fiction and her theoretical work, emphasize [[individual rights]] (including property rights) and [[laissez-faire capitalism]], enforced by [[constitution]]ally limited government. She was a fierce opponent of all forms of [[collectivism]] and [[statism]],<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Collectivism means the subjugation of the individual to a group<U+2014>whether to a race, class or state does not matter.

==Biography==
[[Image:Twelvecollegia.jpg|thumb|right|Rand completed a three-year program in the department of social pedagogy at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]].]] 
===Childhood and education===
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0438><U+0441><U+0430> <U+0417><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0420><U+043E><U+0437><U+0435><U+043D><U+0431><U+0430><U+0443><U+043C>}}) in 1905, into a middle-class family living in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. She was the eldest of the three daughters (Alisa, Natasha, and Nora) of Zinovy Zacharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum, largely non-observant [[Jew]]s. Her father was a [[chemist]] and a successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2-3}}</ref>

Rand was twelve at the time of the [[Russian revolution of 1917]]. From the window of her home, which stood on one of St. Petersburg's great [[Vosstaniya Square|public squares]], Rand witnessed the gathering demonstrators, the red banners, and the first outbreak of violence against those crowds in February, 1917. Opposed to the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]], Rand's sympathies were with [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Rand's family life was disrupted by the rise of the [[Bolshevik]] party. Her father's pharmacy was confiscated by the Soviets, and the family temporarily fled to the [[Crimea]]. At sixteen, Rand returned with her family to Saint Petersburg.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14-20}}</ref>

She enrolled at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]], where she studied in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history. Among her professors was the philosopher [[Nikolai Lossky|N.O. Lossky]].<ref name=Sciabarra>{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm |title=The Rand Transcript" |journal=The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=1999 |month=Fall |pages=1-26}}</ref> It was while at university that she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], who would form two of the greatest influences and counter-influences respectively on her thought.<ref name=Sciabarra/><ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451-460}}</ref> A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. She admired the heroic sensibilities of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but rejected other aspects of his thought.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17-18, 22-24}}</ref> Her formal study of philosophy amounted to only a few courses, however, and outside of these three philosophers, her study of key figures was limited to excerpts and summaries.<ref name="Sciabarra 1995 p=12">{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=12}}</ref> Of the writers she read at this time, [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] became her perennial favorites.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}</ref> As a "non-proletarian," Rand was "purged" from the university shortly before completing. However, bowing to pressure from foreign intellectuals, the communists relented and allowed many of the expelled students to complete their work and graduate,<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}</ref> which Rand did in 1924 after completing a three-year program.<ref name=Sciabarra/> She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Russian Writings on Hollywood |chapter=Introduction |year=1999 |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-last=Berliner |others=Ayn Rand, trans. by Dina Garmong |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute Press |isbn=0-9625336-3-7 |page=10}}</ref>

===Immigration and marriage===
In late 1925, she was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives. She arrived in the United States on February 19, 1926,<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=30}}</ref> entering by ship through [[New York City]], which would ultimately become her home. After a brief stay with her relatives in [[Chicago]], she resolved never to return to the Soviet Union, and set out for [[Hollywood]] to become a screenwriter. While still in Russia she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}</ref> possibly as a [[Cyrillic]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of her birth surname,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=faq_index#ar_q3b |title=What is the origin of <U+201C>Rand<U+201D>? |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref> and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'' from a Finnish name,<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=40}}</ref> perhaps from the author and poet [[Aino Kallas]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Initially, she struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to a job as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in his film, ''[[The King of Kings]],'' and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34-36}}.</ref> While working on ''The King of Kings'', she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]], who caught her eye. The two married on April 15, 1929, and remained married for fifty years, until O'Connor's death. Rand became an [[Naturalization|American citizen]] in 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, for a time Rand worked as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35-40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}.</ref>

===Early fiction===
{{Main|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' in 1932 to [[Universal Studios]]. [[Josef Von Sternberg]] considered it for [[Marlene Dietrich]], but anti-Soviet themes were unpopular at the time, and the project came to nothing.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}.</ref> This was followed by the [[courtroom drama]] ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced in Hollywood in 1934, and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night the "jury" was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's "verdict," would then be performed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1971|pp=3-11}}</ref> In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a movie version of Rand's play ''[[Night of January 16th]]''. She did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fountainheads: Wright, Rand, the FBI and Hollywood |last=Johnson |first=Donald Leslie |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland & Company |year=2005 |isbn=0-7864-1958-X |pages=55-56}} ''cf''. {{harvnb|Rand|1971|pp=13-14}}</ref>

Her first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936 by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]. Set in Communist Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In the foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We The Living'' "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not..."<ref>{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Foreword |title=We The Living |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |page=xviii |isbn=0-525-94054-5 |edition=60th Anniversary |year=1995 |origyear=1936}}</ref> Without Rand's knowledge or permission, ''[[We the Living]]'' was made into a pair of films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira'' in [[Italy]] in 1942. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.<ref>{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}</ref>

The novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was published in England in  1938, and in America seven years later. It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even [[Personal pronoun|the word "I"]] has vanished from the language and from humanity's memory.

===''The Fountainhead''===
{{Main|The Fountainhead|The Fountainhead (film)}}
Rand's first major success came with ''The Fountainhead'' in 1943, a romantic drama and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61-78}}</ref> The novel centers on an uncompromising young [[architect]] named [[Howard Roark]], and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers" <U+2014> those who attempt to live through others, placing others above self. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58-61}}</ref>

Rand wrote a screenplay for the [[Hollywood]] [[The Fountainhead (film)|film of the same name]] (1949, Warner Bros.) starring [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Patricia Neal]]. However, Rand said she "disliked the movie from beginning to end," complaining about its editing, acting and other elements.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}</ref> Rand initially insisted that [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] design the architectural models used in the film, but relented when his fee was too high.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=208-209}}</ref>

''The Fountainhead'' eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. {{asof|April 2008}}, it had sold over 6.5 million copies.<ref name="sales">{{cite web|title=Sales of Ayn Rand Books Reach 25 million Copies |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=17345&news_iv_ctrl=1221 |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-31 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute}}</ref>

===Early activism and professional success===
During the 1940s, Rand became involved in political activism. Both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the 1940 Presidential campaign of [[Wendell Willkie]], and this work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from the audience "following pro-Willkie newsreels at a Union square movie theater" in [[New York City]], an experience she greatly enjoyed.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}</ref> This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. ''The New York Times'' journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife had been friends of Rand and her husband even before her success with ''The Fountainhead'', and in the 1940s Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Both men expressed an admiration for Rand, and, despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188-189}}</ref>

In 1943, Rand returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay for the film version of ''The Fountainhead'' for [[Warner Brothers]], and the following year she and her husband purchased a home designed by modernist [[Richard Neutra]] and an adjoining ranch. There, Rand entertained figures such as Hazlitt, [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Gilbert Adrian]] and [[Leonard Read]]. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor, and her work for Wallis included the Oscar-nominated [[Love Letters (1945 film)|''Love Letters'']] and ''[[You Came Along]]'', along with research for a screenplay based on the development of the [[Nuclear Weapon|atomic bomb]].<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68-80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183-198}}</ref> This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including the publication of her first work of non-fiction, an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow," in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.<ref>Reprinted in {{cite book |first=Ayn |last=Rand |title=[[The Ayn Rand Column]] |publisher=Second Renaissance Books |location=Oceanside, California |year=1991 |isbn=1-56114-099-6 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Schwartz |editor-link=Peter Schwartz (writer) |pages=105<U+2013>108}}</ref> During this period Rand also outlined and took extensive notes for a non-fiction treatment of her philosophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pp=243<U+2013>310}}</ref>

At the invitation of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Rand and her husband visited his famous school of architecture, [[Taliesin East]]. Rand had long admired Wright's work, and after initially rebuffing her efforts to interview him, the architect became an admirer of the ''The Fountainhead'' shortly after its publication. However, Rand found the school to be an oppressive creative environment, calling it "a feudal establishment." Wright later designed a home for Rand which was never built.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=108-119}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=113, 134}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68-69}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=189-191}}</ref>

The most important relationship Rand developed during this period was with [[libertarianism|libertarian]] writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. The two women became friends and philosophical sparring-partners, and Rand is reported to have questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings. Later, the two women had a falling out after what Rand saw as Paterson's bitter and insensitive comments during one of her Hollywood parties. Paterson's influence on Rand's later political theories has been a matter of ongoing debate, but Paterson biographer Stephen Cox credits Rand's public advocacy with keeping her old friend's political work ''[[The God of the Machine]]'' in print for many years, despite their previous break.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Stephen |title=The Woman and the Dynamo |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Transaction |year=2004 |isbn=0-7658-0241-4 |pages=218-222, 287-289, 302-314 and 357-359}}</ref>

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the [[United States]] [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony regarded the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|pp=91-93}}</ref> Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union and portrayed life in the USSR as being much better and happier than it actually was. Furthermore, she believed that even if a temporary alliance with the USSR was necessary to defeat the Nazis, the case for this should not have been made by portraying what she believed were falsely positive images of Soviet life.<ref>"[http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=12 Ayn Rand's HUAC Testimony]" in {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|pp=188-189}}</ref> When asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations after the hearings, Rand described the process as "futile".<ref>{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|p=83}}</ref>

===''Atlas Shrugged''===
{{Main|Atlas Shrugged}}
Rand's ''[[magnum opus]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=704}} "''Atlas Shrugged'' was the climax and completion of the goal I had set for myself at the age of nine. It expressed everything that I wanted of fiction writing."</ref> the 1,100-page ''Atlas Shrugged,'' was published in 1957. Because of the success of ''The Fountainhead,'' the initial print run was 100,000 copies, and the book went on to become an international bestseller. It sells over 125,000 copies annually, with sales in 2007 reaching 185,000 copies.<ref name="atlassales">{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=17225 |title=Sales of ''Atlas Shrugged'' at All-Time Record |date=March 10, 2008 |publisher=[[Ayn Rand Institute]] |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> Rand's last major work of fiction, it marked the turning point in her life, ending her career as novelist and beginning her tenure as popular philosopher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Younkins |first=Edward |title=Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |year=2007 |isbn=0-7546-5549-0 |chapter=Preface |page=1 |quote=''Atlas Shrugged'' <U+2026> is the demarcation work and turning point that culminated [Rand's] career as a novelist and propelled her into a career as a popular philosopher}}.</ref>

The theme of ''Atlas Shrugged'' is "the role of the mind in man's existence&mdash;and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of [[rational self-interest]]."<ref>{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=For the New Intellectual |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1961}}</ref> It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists and artists go on [[strike action|strike]] and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent [[Free market|free economy]]. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the "minds" that Rand saw as contributing the most to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and [[science fiction]],<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}</ref> and contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.

A film adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged'' has been discussed for many years, and several attempts have been made to bring it into production, but none has ever moved beyond the planning stages.<ref>{{cite book |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged |chapter=Bringing ''Atlas Shrugged'' to Film |last=Britting |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Britting |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-2779-7 |page=195}}</ref>

===Later years===
{{Main|Objectivist movement}}{{Objectivist movement}}
In 1951 Rand moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]], the city she most loved and admired. From 1965 to her death in 1982, she resided at 120 East 34th Street. In New York, she formed a group (jokingly designated "[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]") which included future [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and [[Leonard Peikoff]], all of whom had been profoundly influenced by ''The Fountainhead.''

The group originally started out as an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy; later the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, reading ''Atlas Shrugged'' as the manuscript pages were written and, following its publication, promoting Rand's philosophy through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), established by him for that purpose. Collective members gave lectures at the NBI and in cities across the United States and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. 

After several years, Rand's close relationship with the much younger Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=257<U+2013>254, 331<U+2013>343}}</ref> In 1964, Branden entered into an affair with the young actress [[Patrecia Scott]], whom he later married. The Brandens hid the affair from Rand and lied about it. Though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens when she discovered their dishonesty. As a result, NBI closed.<ref>{{cite book |title=My Years with Ayn Rand |last=Branden |first=Nathaniel |location=San Francisco |publisher=Jossey Bass |year=1998 |isbn=0-7879-4513-7 |oclc=39391081 |page=354}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344-358}}</ref> She published a letter in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=To Whom It May Concern |journal=The Objectivist |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=1<U+2013>8 |location=New York |year=1968 |month=May}}</ref>

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her non-fiction works, and by giving talks, for example at [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315-316}}</ref> In subsequent years, she went on to lecture at [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison|University of Wisconsin]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}</ref> She received an honorary doctorate from [[Lewis & Clark College]] in 1963.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}</ref> For many years, she gave also an annual lecture at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterwards in her famously spirited form to questions from the audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}</ref>

On July 16, 1969, as invited "VIPs," Rand and her husband attended the launch of [[Apollo 11]], the space mission which first landed men on the surface of the moon. This event inspired two of her essays.<ref>Ayn Rand, "Apollo 11," ''The Objectivist'', Sept. 1969; and "Apollo and Dionysus," ''The Objectivist'', Dec. 1969 and Jan. 1970, reprinted in ''Return of the Primitive'', P. Schwartz, ed. (Meridian, 1999), pp. 99-118. The latter essay contrasts the moon launch with the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] music festival.</ref> Rand also became a friend of astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].<ref>Letter to M. Collins in {{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=648}}</ref> Other friends of Rand during this period include writer [[Mickey Spillane]] and music critic [[Deems Taylor]].<ref>Letters to M.

In 1973, she was briefly reunited with her youngest sister, Nora, who still lived in the Soviet Union. Although Rand had initially attempted to bring her family to the United States, she had ceased contacting them in 1937 after reading a notice in the post office that letters from Americans might imperil Russians at risk from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] repression. Rand received a letter from Nora in 1973 and invited her and her husband to America; but her sister's views had changed, and to Rand's disappointment Nora voluntarily returned to the USSR.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=7581 |title=Ayn Rand's Sister: Eleanora Drobyshev 1910-1999 |date=October 15, 2000 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>

===Declining health and death===
[[Image:Ayn Rand Marker.jpg|thumb|right|Grave marker of [[Frank O'Connor (actor)|Frank O'Connor]] and Ayn Rand.]] Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974, and conflicts continued in the wake of the break with Branden and the subsequent collapse of the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI). Several more of her closest "Collective" friends parted company with her,<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=386-389}}</ref> and during the late 1970s her activities within the [[Objectivist movement]] declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=392-395}}</ref> One of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged.'' She had also planned to write another novel, ''To Lorne Dieterling'', but did not get far in her notes.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=697}}</ref>

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982 at her 34th Street home in [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Ayn Rand, <U+2018>Fountainhead<U+2019> Author, Dies |first=Wolfgang |last=Saxon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/obituaries/07randobit.html?&pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1982 |accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> years after having successfully battled cancer, and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], [[New York]]. Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. [[David Kelley]] read her favorite poem, [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s "[[If<U+2014>]]". A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=403}}</ref>

In her will, Rand named [[Leonard Peikoff]] the heir to her estate. With her endorsement of his 1976 lecture series, she had recognized his work as being the best exposition of her philosophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=xiii-xv}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Rand saw her views as constituting an integrated philosophical system, which she called "Objectivism". The essence of Objectivism, according to Rand, is "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."<ref>"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170-1171}}.</ref>  

Rejecting [[faith]] as antithetical to reason, Rand opposed any form of mysticism or supernaturalism, including organized religion, and she embraced [[philosophical realism]].<ref>Den Uyl, Douglas J. & Rasmussen, Douglas B. "Ayn Rand's Realism." in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3-20}}</ref> Rand also argued for [[rational egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the only proper guiding moral principle. The individual "must exist for his own sake", she wrote in 1962, "neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself".<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Voice of Reason]] |first=Ayn |last=Rand |others=Edited by Leonard Peikoff |location=New York |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |isbn=0-453-00634-5 |chapter=Introducing Objectivism |page=3}} This article originally appeared in the ''Los Angeles Times'' on June 17, 1962.</ref> In 1976, she said that her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil<U+2014>the violation of rights<U+2014>consists of the initiation of force."<ref>{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |year=2005 |title=Ayn Rand Answers, the Best of Her Q&A |isbn=0-451-21665-2 |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |page=166}}</ref>

Rand held that the only moral social system is ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]]. Her political views were strongly [[individualism|individualist]] and hence [[anti-statist]] and [[anti-Communist]]. Rand detested many [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[American conservatism|conservative]] politicians of her time, including prominent anti-Communists.<ref>{{cite news |last=Toffler |first=Alivin |title=Playboy Interview: Ayn Rand |work=Playboy |month=March |year=1964 |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/ayn-rand-playboy-interview/index.html |quote=I'm opposed to any compromiser or me-tooer, and Mr. Nixon is probably the champion in this regard.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |first=Maureen |last=Dowd |title=Where 'Atlas Shrugged' Is Still Read - Forthrightly |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/weekinreview/where-atlas-shrugged-is-still-read-forthrightly.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 1982 |accessdate=2009-08-01 |quote=Miss Rand was vehemently anti-Reagan when he challenged Gerald Ford in 1976, and her disciples never saw much sign that she softened toward him over the years.}}</ref> Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the [[Cato Institute]], considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Isabel Paterson]]) of modern American [[libertarianism]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Jim |title=Rose Wilder Lane, Isabel Paterson, and Ayn Rand: Three Women Who Inspired the Modern Libertarian Movement |url=http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=3345 |journal=The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty |month=May |year=1996 |volume=46 |issue=5}}</ref> although she rejected libertarianism and the [[libertarian movement]].

She acknowledged [[Aristotle]] as a great influence,<ref>"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1171}}.</ref> and found early inspiration in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=100<U+2013>106}}</ref> although she later rejected his approach, holding it to be anti-reason. She remarked that in the [[history of philosophy]] she could only recommend "three A's" <U+2014>[[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], and Ayn Rand.<ref name="Sciabarra 1995 p=12"/>  Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was [[Immanuel Kant]], whom she referred to as a "monster" and "the most evil man in history". Rand was strongly opposed to the view she ascribed to Kant that reason is unable to know reality "as it is in itself."  She considered her philosophy to be the "exact opposite" of Kant's on "every fundamental issue".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=Brief Summary |journal=The Objectivist |month=September |year=1971 |volume=10 |issue=9 |page=4}}</ref> Objectivist philosophers George Walsh<ref name="Walsh">{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=George V. |title=Ayn Rand and the Metaphysics of Kant |journal=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |year=2000 |month=Fall |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=69-103 |url=http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/objectivity/walsh1/}}</ref> and Fred Seddon<ref>{{cite book |last=Seddon |first=Fred |title=Ayn Rand, Objectivists, and the History of Philosophy |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |year=2003 |pages=63-81 |isbn=0-7618-2308-5}}</ref> have both argued that Rand misinterpreted Kant. In particular, Walsh argues that both philosophers adhere to many of the same basic positions, and that Rand exaggerated her differences with Kant. Walsh says that for many critics, Rand's writing on Kant is "ignorant and unworthy of discussion".<ref name="Walsh"/>

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas Rasmussen describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional", while stressing the importance and originality of her thought.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1=Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=[[The Personalist]] |year=1978 |month=April |volume=59 |page=203 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> Similarly, philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", he considers Rand's ethics to be "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought."<ref>Wheeler, Jack. "Rand and Aristotle." in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=96}}.</ref>

==Reception==
Rand's novels, when they were first published, were derided by some critics as long and melodramatic.<ref name="Gladstein 117-119">{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117-119}}.</ref> They became bestsellers due largely to word of mouth.<ref>{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=87}}.</ref>

The first reviews Rand received were for her play ''Night of January 16''. Reviews of the Broadway production were mixed, and Rand considered even the positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=122-124}}</ref> 
Rand herself described her first novel, ''We the Living'', as not being widely reviewed, but Michael S. Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works," with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Many of these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=Reviews of ''We the Living'' |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's We the Living |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2004 |isbn=0-7391-0698-8 |pages=147-151}}</ref>

Her 1938 novella ''Anthem'' received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for several subsequent re-issues.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=Reviews of ''Anthem'' |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Anthem |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2005 |isbn=0-7391-1031-4 |pages=55-60}}</ref>

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.<ref name="tfreviews">{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=''The Fountainhead'' Reviews |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2006 |isbn=0-7391-1578-2 |pages=77-82}}</ref> There was a positive review in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that Rand greatly appreciated.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=74}}</ref> The ''Times'' reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who writes "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly," and it stated that she had "written a hymn in praise of the individual... you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time."<ref>{{cite news |first=Lorine |last=Pruette |work=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1943 |title=Battle Against Evil |page=BR7 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FD3D5C167B93C4A8178ED85F478485F9}}</ref> There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed many of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.<ref name="tfreviews"/> A number of negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,<ref name="Gladstein 117-119" /> such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing." Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian."<ref name="tfreviews"/>

Rand's 1957 novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.<ref name="Gladstein 117-119"/><ref name="asreviews">{{cite book |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |chapter=The ''Atlas Shrugged'' Reviews |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-2780-3 |pages=133-137}}</ref> In the ''[[National Review]]'', conservative author [[Whittaker Chambers]] called the book "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly," and said it "can be called a novel only by devaluing the term". He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting the same godless system as the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]], claiming "From almost any page of ''Atlas Shrugged'', a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber<U+2014>go!'"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chambers |first=Whittaker |authorlink=Whittaker Chambers |title=Big Sister is Watching You |journal=National Review |pages=594<U+2013>596 |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback200501050715.asp |date=December 8, 1957}}</ref> A few publications gave the novel positive reviews,<ref name="asreviews"/> but as [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] later described them, many reviewers "seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs," calling the book "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare;" they said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity."<ref name="Gladstein 117-119"/>

During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.<ref name=reception/> When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously.<ref>{{cite book |title=With Charity Toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy |last=O'Neill |first=William F. |location=New York |publisher=Littlefield, Adams & Company |year=1977 |origyear=1971 |isbn=0-8226-0179-6 |page=3}}</ref> A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals prior to her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}. The best-known example of an academic article about Rand in the 1970s is {{cite journal |title=On the Randian Argument |last=Nozick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |journal=[[The Personalist]] |year=1971 |month=Spring |volume=52 |pages=282-304}} Responses to Nozick also appeared, including: {{cite journal |title=Nozick and Rand on Property Rights |last=Machan |first=Tibor |journal=The Personalist |year=1977 |month=April |volume=58 |pages=192-195}} and {{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1=Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=The Personalist |year=1978 |month=April |volume=59 |pages=184-205}}</ref> Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2005|pp=57-58, 63}}.

===Academic scholarship===
Since Rand's death in 1982, there has been gradually increasing interest in her work,<ref>{{worldcat|name=Ayn Rand|id=lccn-n50-54463}}</ref> and her ideas have found some recognition.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=John R. |editor-last=Shook |first1=Gregory |last1=Salmieri |first2=Allan |last2=Gotthelf |chapter=Rand, Ayn (1905-82) |title=The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers |publisher=Thoemmes Continuum |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=1-84371-037-4 |lastauthoramp=y |page=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McLemee |first=Scott |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective? |date=September 1999 |accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> Although few universities currently consider Rand or Objectivism to be a worthy philosophical specialty or research area, some American universities have established chairs or centers for the study of Rand's views, and fellowships have been established to support individual scholars.  In a 1999 interview in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]],'' Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] commented, "I know they laugh at Rand," while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sharlet |first=Jeff |work=Chronicle of Higher Education |url=http://chronicle.com/colloquy/99/rand/background.htm|title="Ayn Rand Has Finally Caught the Attention of Scholars"|accessdate=2006-03-28}}</ref>

[[Chris Matthew Sciabarra|Chris Sciabarra]] has called into question the motives of some of Rand's critics on account of what he calls unusual hostility of their criticisms.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=9-14}}</ref> Sciabarra says, "The left was infuriated by her anti-communist, procapitalist politics, whereas the right was disgusted with her atheism and civil libertarianism."<ref name=reception>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=1}}</ref>

Rand scholars such as Sciabarra, [[Allan Gotthelf]], and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] have made attempts to introduce her into formal academia. Sciabarra co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a self-described "nonpartisan" peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/reviews.asp|title=''Journal of Ayn Rand Studies''|accessdate=2006-03-28}}</ref> In 1987, Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society, which is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]] and has been active in sponsoring seminars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandsociety.org/ |title=''Ayn Rand Society'' |accessdate=2007-10-03}}</ref> Smith has published several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at [[Clemson University|Clemson]] and [[Duke University|Duke]] universities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/NEWS/505150346/1014 |title=Ayn Rand at 100: An 'ism' struts its stuff |first=Benjamin |last=Harvey |agency=Columbia News Service |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref>

Scholars of English and American [[literature]] have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2005|p=59, 65-70}}</ref> In the ''[[Literary Encyclopedia]]'' entry for Rand written in 2001, John Lewis declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation".<ref name=litenc>{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=John David |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=3705 |work=The Literary Encyclopedia |title=Ayn Rand |accessdate=2009-08-02 |date=20 October 2001}}</ref>

===Institutes===
In 1985, [[Leonard Peikoff]] established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], which "works to introduce young people to Ayn Rand's novels, to support scholarship and research based on her ideas, and to promote the principles of reason, rational self-interest, individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism to the widest possible audience."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8345 |title=Charity Navigator Rating - The Ayn Rand Institute |publisher=Charity Navigator |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> In 1990, [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]]. Its focus is on attracting readers of Ayn Rand's fiction. The associated Objectivist Center division deals with more academic ventures. In 2000, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia. Grants have gone to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Anthem Foundation Renews Gift for Ayn Rand Research on 50th Anniversary of "Atlas Shrugged" |date=October 1, 2007 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2007/10/01/lib_arts-2/ |accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>
