The '''Sloat House''' is located at the corner of [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]] and Sterling Avenue in [[Sloatsburg, New York|Sloatsburg]], New York, United States. It is a stone house, dating to the mid-18th century, with a [[framing (construction)|frame]] front addition built in the 1810s.

It was the home for many years of members of the Sloat family, for whom the village is named. [[George Washington]] may have visited it during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and [[John D. Sloat]], later the first American [[Military Governor of California]], was born here. It also served as a meeting place for local politicians and officials during the Revolution and some decades afterward. In 1974 it became the first property in the village listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Building==

The house has two blocks, built at different times. The older rear section, the kitchen wing, is one-and-a-half stories high and {{convert|22|by|30|ft|m}}. It is faced in [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]], except for the north wall which is rough stone. It has two original [[Dutch door]]s, with their hinges. There is also an enclosed porch.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The {{convert|34|by|48|ft|m}} main wing is two and a half stories, faced in stone with a brick front, both painted white. It has a [[porch]] running the full length of all five front [[bay (architecture)|bays]]. The main entrance leads into a ground floor with four large rooms, each with its own original [[fireplace]] and wooden [[mantel]]. The six chimneys in both wings pierce [[gable]]d roofs [[roof shingle|shingled]] in [[asphalt]]. The house has a full [[cellar]] as well.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Three outbuildings remain on the property: a small barn, a large stable and a wellhouse. All three are remnants of the farming operations, and are considered [[contributing property|contributing resources]] to the Register listing.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

==History==

There may have been a house on the site in the late 1730s, when Isaac Van Deursen became the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European settler]] in the upper [[Ramapo River]] valley. The current wing may actually have been this house or part of it, since it is very primitive.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Traditionally, histories of the area have dated the house's original wing to 1755, when Stephen Sloat received the land as a wedding gift from his father-in-law. An early [[framing (construction)|frame]] front was probably on the front of the house through the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], which had an impact on both the house and the Sloat family.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In 1774, a local meeting at the house, the General Meeting of Committees of [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]],<ref name="explanation">[[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] was not created until the early 19th century.</ref> chose two delegates, Henry Wisner and John Haring, to the Provincial Convention of the [[First Continental Congress]]. Five years later, in 1779, [[George Washington]] spent at least one night at the house, according to one historian.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Tragedy struck the Sloats in 1781 when their son John, a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the local [[Militia (United States)#Revolutionary War (1775-1783)|militia]], was accidentally shot and killed in the doorway by one of the sentries his father had hired.<ref name="NYT story">{{cite news|last=Cheslow|first=Jerry|title=If You're Thinking of Living In: Sloatsburg|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DE143EF931A25752C1A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 12, 1989|accessdate=March 13, 2009|quote=Sloat's house was the Revolutionary War headquarters of a regiment commanded by his son, Capt.

The infant son Sloat left behind grew up to be [[John D. Sloat]], a celebrated [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Commodore (USN)|commodore]] and the first [[List of governors of California|governor of California]].<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Isaac Sloat, John's brother, later built the front of the house around 1813-14. He ran it as a [[public house]], also hosting annual meetings of [[town supervisor]]s and judges from Orange and Rockland counties through 1821. His son Stephen ran the house as an inn along the [[Orange Turnpike]], renowned for its food but serving no [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]. At this point the large barn was also built. Stephen's brother Jacob developed a mill along the creek and later built [[Jacob Sloat House|his own house]] in the village.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In 1905 the Sloat descendants sold the house to Benjamin Moffatt Jr., an [[English American|English immigrant]] who later became president of the nearby Sterling iron works. It remained in the Moffatt family throughout the 20th century and is still a private residence.<ref name="NRHP nom" />
