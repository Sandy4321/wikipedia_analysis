'''Ming Chuan University''' is a family owned university founded by [[Pao Teh-Ming]] and her husband [[Lee Ying-Chao]].  Named after the famous progressive [[Qing Dynasty]] governor of Taiwan [[Liu Mingchuan]], it is known to be a decent business and management institution in Taiwan.

==History==
The institution was founded as a three year [[junior college|junior women's college]] in 1963 known as '''Ming Chuan College'''.  It expanded to offer a five year junior women's college program in 1964.  In Taiwan, the junior college program allows a high school freshman to by-pass the remaining years of high school and to enter a type of vocational college.

The institution experienced rapid growth in the 1990s.  In 1990, the institution gradually eliminated its junior college program and offered a coed program with a [[bachelor's degree]].  With the completion of the construction of two additional campuses and the introduction of graduate degrees, Ming Chuan College was fully upgraded into Ming Chuan University in 1997.

==Campus==
The university is divided into three campuses.  The main campus is located in [[Taipei City]]'s [[Shilin|Shihlin District]] near the [[Grand Hotel (Tapei City)|Grand Hotel]].  [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong_May-ling]] donated the land for the main campus, resulting in the Lee family being one of the staunchest supporters in keeping the memory of Chiang Kai-shek alive in Taiwan.  The second campus is located in [[Gueishan]], [[Taoyuan]] county.  The Lee family originally intended the land for the second campus to be a fruit orchard, but decided to use the land to expand the school so that it could achieve full-university status.  The third campus on [[Kinmen]] Island is meant to expand the educational opportunities of the residents there.

==Organization==
The current president Lee Chuan is the son of the university founders Pao Teh-Ming and Lee Ying-Chao.  The university is divided into the following schools:
*Management
*Tourism
*Law
*Communication
*Information
*Design
*Applied Languages
*Social Science
*Health
*International College

==Sports==
The university currently has a team called "Bros" playing in the [[Enterprise Football League]].
