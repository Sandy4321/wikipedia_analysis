'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like math, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both the language by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas & Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987).
Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.<ref>(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas & Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)</ref>
*   Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language.

==By country or region==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf<ref>(2005)</ref> explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students were begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 21 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalunya, Northern Territory|Gunbalunya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris & Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Canada===
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

====English and French====
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an Extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Currently, education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located. The second official language is introduced with a minimal amount of allocated time provided each week in the form of just one single subject.

====Qu<U+00E9>bec====
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

====First Nations and Inuit reservations====
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[first nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reservations in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and pacific coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were initially set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 80s, [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reservation levels.

====Other minority languages====
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thusfar adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is presently being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available.  In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

===China===
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally-based content.<ref>{{cite book|

|isbn= 1402080387, 9781402080388|pages =119<U+2013>120}}
</ref>

Classes of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.<ref>Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120</ref>

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous counties of China|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was though to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.<ref>Zhou (2004), p. 88</ref> Presumably, the state's failure to offer instruction in the language of the county's [[titular nation|titular ethnic group]]  was due to the [[ethnic groups in China|ethnic group]] in question being too small and/or remote  to possess qualified teachers or instruction materials in their language.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9).

===European Union===
Near most of the various [[European Union]] institution sites, [[European School]]s have been created to allow staff to have their children receive their education in their mother tongue, and at the same time to foster European spirit by (among other things) teaching at least two other European languages.

Basic instruction is given in the eleven official languages of the European Union: Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. In the expansion of the Union with 10 countries in 2004 and two more in 2007, the new official languages of the EU are added. The pupil's mother tongue (L I) therefore remains his/her first language throughout the School.

Consequently, each school comprises several language sections. The curricula and syllabuses (except in the case of mother tongue) are the same in all sections.

In the Schools where the creation of a separate language section cannot be justified based on the number of students, teaching of the mother tongue and possibly mathematics is provided.

To foster the unity of the School and encourage genuine multicultural education, there is a strong emphasis on the learning, understanding and use of foreign languages. This is developed in a variety of ways:

The study of a first foreign language (English, French, or German, known as L II) is compulsory throughout the school, from first year primary up to the Baccalaureate. In secondary school, some classes will be taught in L II.

All pupils must study a second foreign language (L III), starting in the second year of secondary school. Any language available in the School may be chosen.

Pupils may choose to study a third foreign language (L IV) from the fourth year of secondary school.

Language classes are composed of mixed nationalities and taught by a native speaker.

A weekly "European Hour" in the primary school brings together children from all sections for cultural and artistic activities and games.

In the secondary school, classes in art, music and sport are always composed of mixed nationalities.

From the third year of secondary school, history and geography are studied in the pupil's first foreign language, also called the "working language" (English, French, or German). Economics, which may be taken as an option from the fourth year of the secondary school, is also studied in a working language. From the third year, therefore, all social science subjects are taught to groups of mixed nationalities.<ref>[http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=132id=132&l=2 "European Schools Principles and objectives"]</ref>

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. Belgian children are constitutionally protected with the right to receive their education through any of the three official languages. Belgian education, like that of Canada, is taught in the medium that represents the majority language of a given population, i.e. schools in Flanders teach through Dutch, schools in Waloonia teach through French.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (i.e. Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does not occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. in Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307<U+2013>321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=http://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}</ref>

====France====
[[France]] has one sole official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages such as [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Occitan]], and [[Breton language|Breton]] do have charter protection, and respectively there are bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally-allocated funding towards any of these programmes. All funding is done at the municipal level, with more often than not regional languages themselves facing extreme endangerment.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is. 

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language (L1) is Dutch, whereas the second language (L2) is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own official language ([[West Frisian language]]), some trilingual primary schools exist. In those schools, the children are taught in Dutch, Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Tweetalig Voorbereidend Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs or Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but there is THAVO (Tweetalig Hoger Algemeen Voorbereidend Onderwijs or Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education), too. The following subjects are taught in English: arts, chemistry, physics, biology, geography, economics, physical education, drama, English, mathematics, history, music, social sciences and religious studies, but some variation may exist among schools.

====Spain====
=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in our territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through 5 major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding. Currently in [[Catalonia]] the education has become monolingual in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] only. 

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====United Kingdom====
[[Great Britain]] has several languages indigenous to the territory apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]].

[[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Mann]], respectively, have established bilingual programmes through which one can receive their education through the medium of that regional language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the medium of Welsh, and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh has been met with great success across Wales with the first Welsh medium schools opening in the 1940s and have since grown on a phenomenal rate. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and Llanelli to cater for growing Welsh medium demand, this has caused controversy in some areas. 

Respectively, traditional Welsh-speaking areas implement the use of Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh and each local authority have provisions to cater these needs. In the Western flank of Wales, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Gwynedd, and Anglesey most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium education schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from the age of 5 - 16 in all state funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
As [[Northern Ireland]] is British territory, English is recognised as the ''[[de facto]]'' [[official language|official]] [[language]] of the country, however, both [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] have been recognised as regional languages and are protected under the constitution. 

Ulster Scots is often treated as a dialect of English, and as a result no education is provided through it. However, the Irish language is enjoying a vibrant resurgence, especially in the city of [[Belfast]]. Northern Ireland also borders [[County Donegal]], which is home to a number of the Irish Republic's traditional [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking) communities. With that, Northern Ireland has happily adopted and established numerous Irish-medium education programmes as seen in mainland Ireland. Children can complete their entire base education through the medium of either Irish or English.

The study of Irish as a second language is compulsory up until the end of tenth year in all Catholic grammar and secondary schools. This does not apply to Protestant schools.

===India===
[[India]] has only one official language, [[Hindi]], with English as the language for official communication till 1965.There are a web of recognized regional languages which also hold official status including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

[[English language|English]] gains favour due to its international prestige as well as its primary status in Indian state universities. Despite a lack of access to education often being a problem and low rates of literacy, education is conducted trilingually in the regional language, Hindi, and English - or in many cases, monolingually in English.

===Japan===
{{Refimprove|date=March 2007}}
In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving new found interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

===Middle East===
====The Arab World====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), where as  Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.   

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic come later grades. Due to Morroco's long history with French colonialism, alongside neighbouring countries including [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]], sole French-medium education is very widespread, with Arabic being introduced and taught as a second language, as well as the study of a third language later on, usually either [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[Italian language|Italian]] (in [[Libya]]).

====Israel====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also lead to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

===Philippines===
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards mother-tongue based learning initially by issuing an order which allows two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.<ref>[http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf DepEd Order 74 of 2009] (PDF)</ref> Other [[Philippine languages|Philippine regional languages]] are taught in schools, colleges and universities located in their [[Provinces of the Philippines|respective provinces]].

===Southeast Asia (Thailand, Malaysia)===
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).  The Malaysian government recently reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.  Wichai Wittaya Bilingual School in Chaing Mai (1995),<ref>[http://www.wichai.ac.th Wichai Wittaya Bilingual School<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Siriwat Wittaya Bilingual School in Bangkok(2004) ,<ref>[http://www.siriwat.ac.th Siriwat Wittaya Bilingual School<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Chindemanee School English Program (2005),<ref>[http://www.chindamanee.ac.th Chindamanee School English Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Sarasas model, pioneered by the Sarasas schools affiliation in Thailand,are exemplars of parallel immersion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The [[English for Integrated Studies]] project model at Sunthonphu Pittaya Secondary School(SPSS), Rayong, Thailand, is an exemplar of the use of English for integrated studies in Math, Science and IT, taught by non-native English speaking Thai teachers.<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/surapongeisth English for Integrated Studies Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This project is under the auspices of the International Study Program of [[Burapha University]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Panyaden School]] is an example of a private bilingual school in North Thailand that provides its students with a Thai-English education (each class has a Thai teacher and native-English speaking teacher).

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===United States of America===
[[File:TripGalvPhotosGulftJapancon 019.JPG|thumb|[[SER-Ni<U+00F1>os Charter School]], a bilingual [[charter school|state charter school]] in the [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]] area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL). According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for limited English proficient students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research. An English Language Learner is a a term used to describe a student whose second language is English, and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the fifty states of the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,<ref>(1997)</ref> a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students are enrolled in bilingual classes,<ref name="'70s 270">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= |pages= 270<U+2013>271|url= }}</ref> there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.<ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity">{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|isbn= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED167674 }}</ref>  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.<ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/>  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.<ref name="The American bilingual Tradition">{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|year= 1977/1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}</ref>  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.<ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice">{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}</ref> By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.<ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/> Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.<ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/>  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.<ref name="'70s 270"/>

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.<ref name="'70s 270"/>  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students<ref name="'70s 270"/> without special  provisions.<ref>[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.<ref name="'70s 270"/>

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

====Controversy in the United States====
There has been much debate over bilingual education in recent times. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."<ref>{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.<ref>(see Krashen, 2002; August & Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)</ref> Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |year=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language & Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/directions/04.htm |accessdate=2008-03-13 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.<ref>{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |year=1999 |month=03 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective  |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate= 2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture.}}</ref>
Some people make the mistake that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.<ref>{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  | coauthors =Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED392281  | isbn =1-85359-297-8}}</ref>

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages<ref name="'70s 270"/> and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.<ref name="'70s 270"/> Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the Young Lords, Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'" (p.107).<ref>Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]</ref>


====California====
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.<ref name="'70s 270"/> In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year", then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."<ref>[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California]</ref> This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.<ref>Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]</ref>

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.<ref>[http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf American Institutes for Research (AIR)]</ref> The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.<ref>[http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Arizona====
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.<ref name="'70s 270"/>

====Georgia====
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and presently Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the [[carpet]] industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]</ref>

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the Georgia Project in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.<ref>[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]</ref>

====Massachusetts====
In 2002, more than two-thirds of Massachusetts' voters supported an initiative replacing bilingual education programs with "one-year" English Immersion instruction.<ref>[http://www.internationalist.org/bilingualeducation0103.html Bilingual Education Under Racist Attack<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The initiative was supported by the ProEnglish campaign and the Republican Mitt Romney, who at the time was campaigning for governor. The close to 30,000 bilingual education students within Massachusetts were forced to enter classrooms where they would be instructed specifically and intensively in English.<ref>http://www.proenglish.org/issues/education/bestatus.html</ref>

====Native American Reservations====
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is. 

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.
