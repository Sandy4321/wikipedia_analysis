Early in his political career, Pi<U+0142>sudski became a leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. Concluding, however, that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the [[Russian Empire]]'s defeat by the [[Central Powers]], and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers.<ref>[[#refRoos1966|Roos 1966]], p. 14; [[#refRothschild1990|Rothschild 1990]], p. 45.</ref> When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought alongside the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German Empire]]s to ensure Russia's defeat. In 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support from the Central Powers.

From November 1918, when Poland regained independence, until 1922 Pi<U+0142>sudski was Poland's ''[[Naczelnik Pa<U+0144>stwa|Chief of State]]''. In 1919<U+2013>21 he commanded Poland's forces in the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. In 1923, with the [[Polish government]] dominated by his opponents, particularly the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], he withdrew from active politics. Three years later, he returned to power with the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'']], and became the ''de facto'' dictator of Poland. An [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascist]] ambassador to Warsaw described him as "a liberal democrat in the clothes of an old-world knight".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=fE2quB852jcC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22a+liberal+democrat+in+the+clothes+of+an+old-world+knight.%22&source=bl&ots=6dw7cSdMpC&sig=SolfvnnNLLedGMq3t6njz_OGuzc&hl=en&ei=PvVrTPeCM4GsOJTuqZ0B&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ National identity and foreign policy: nationalism and leadership in Poland, Russia and Ukraine] Ilya Prizel,
Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 60</ref> From then until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and [[foreign affairs]].

For at least thirty years until his death, Pi<U+0142>sudski pursued, with varying degrees of intensity, two complementary strategies, intended to enhance Poland's security: "[[Prometheism]]", which aimed at breaking up, successively, [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] into their constituent nations; and the creation of an [[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze|Intermarum]] federation, comprising Poland and several of her neighbors. Though a number of his political acts remain controversial, Pi<U+0142>sudski's memory is held in high esteem by his compatriots.<ref name="TT_NGP"/><ref name="Goldfarb"/><ref name="Pozeg6"/><ref name="Roshwald"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski was born on 5 December 1867 to a [[Pi<U+0142>sudski coat of arms|Polish noble]] family at their [[Pilsudski (family)|family's]] manor in the village of [[Zalavas]] ({{lang-pl|Zu<U+0142><U+00F3>w}}) in [[Lithuania]]. At the time of his birth it was a part of the Russian Empire as a result of [[partitions of Poland|partitions]] by the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] at the end of the 18th century.  Currently it is part of the [[<U+0160>ven<U+010D>ionys district municipality]] of [[Lithuania]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/> The [[Pi<U+0142>sudski family]], impoverished [[szlachta]],<ref name="Pidl"/> cherished Polish patriotic traditions<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Urb 13-15"/> and has been characterized either as Polish<ref name="HD"/><ref name="Davies40"/> or as [[Polonized]]-[[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].<ref name=Pidl/><ref>[[#refBideleux1998|Bideleux 1998]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Eh9KQTrOckC&pg=PA186 p. 186].</ref>{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Young J<U+00F3>zef was the second son born to the family.

[[File:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pi<U+0142>sudski as a schoolboy]]
J<U+00F3>zef, when he attended the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' at Vilnius, was not an especially diligent student.<ref name="Aviel"/> Ironically, one of the younger students at this gymnasium was the future communist [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], who later would become Pi<U+0142>sudski's archenemy.<ref>Robert Blobaum. ''Feliks Dzierzynsky and the SDKPiL: A study of the origins of Polish Communism.'' 1984. ISBN 978-0-88033-046-6 p. 30.</ref>
Along with his brothers [[Adam Pi<U+0142>sudski|Adam]], [[Bronis<U+0142>aw Pi<U+0142>sudski|Bronis<U+0142>aw]] and [[Jan Pi<U+0142>sudski|Jan]], J<U+00F3>zef was introduced by his mother Maria, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.<ref name="MM-208"/> His father, likewise named J<U+00F3>zef, had fought in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against Russian rule of Poland.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

The family resented the Russian government's [[Russification]] policies. Young J<U+00F3>zef profoundly disliked having to attend [[Russian Orthodox Church]] service<ref name="MM-208"/> and left school with an aversion not only for the [[Russian Tsar]] and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.<ref name=Pidl/>

In 1885 Pi<U+0142>sudski started [[medical school|medical studies]] at [[Kharkov University]], where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.<ref name="PWN"/> In 1886 he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> He was rejected by the [[University of Dorpat]] ([[Tartu]], Estonia), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> On 22 March 1887 he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with [[Vilnius]] socialists to assassinate [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. In fact Pi<U+0142>sudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement in it of his elder brother, Bronis<U+0142>aw.<ref name="BronPi<U+0142>">{{cite web

J<U+00F3>zef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirensk]] on the [[Lena River]], then at [[Tunka]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Urb 50"/> While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Pi<U+0142>sudski was held for several weeks at a prison in [[Irkutsk]].<ref name="Pilsudski, Hero of Poland"/> There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: after one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;<ref name="Urb 62<U+2013>66"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.<ref name="Urb 62<U+2013>66"/> For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.<ref name="Urb 68<U+2013>69"/> He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.<ref name="Urb 68<U+2013>69"/>

During his years of exile in Siberia, Pi<U+0142>sudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronis<U+0142>aw Szwarce]], who had almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].<ref name="Urb 74<U+2013>77"/> He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages<ref name=Pidl/> (he knew French, German and Lithuanian<ref>{{cite web

In 1892 Pi<U+0142>sudski returned from exile and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in [[<U+0160>ilal<U+0117> district]]). In 1893 he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS'')<ref name="Poland.gov"/> and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.<ref name="Urb 88"/> Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] he remained a Polish nationalist.<ref name="MM-209"/> In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he began publishing an [[bibu<U+0142>a|underground]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Robotnik (1894<U+2013>1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a [[typesetter]].<ref name="Poland.gov" /><ref name="PWN" /><ref name="Urb 93"/><ref name="Pi<U+0142>sudski12">[[#refPilsudski1989|Pi<U+0142>sudski 1989]], p. 12.</ref> In 1895 he became a PPS leader, and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.<ref name="PWN"/>

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|upright|Pi<U+0142>sudski in 1899]]
On 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Pi<U+0142>sudski married a fellow socialist organizer, [[Maria Pi<U+0142>sudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Koplewska]].<ref name="Alabrudzinska99"/><ref name="Garlicki63"/><ref name="Pobog-Malinowski07"/>  According to his chief biographer, Wac<U+0142>aw J<U+0119>drzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in socialist and independence movement. The printing press of "Robotnik" was in their apartment first in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], than in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]]. Having a pretext of regular family life made their accommodation safer from suspicion. The Russian law also protected the wife from prosecution of illegal activities of the husband.<ref>"Pi<U+0142>sudski: A Life For Poland", Wac<U+0142>aw J<U+0119>drzejewicz, Hipocremne Books, New York, 1982, ISBN 978-0-87052-747-0, p. 27-28</ref> The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Pi<U+0142>sudski began an affair with a younger socialist,<ref name="MM-209"/> [[Aleksandra Pi<U+0142>sudska|Aleksandra Szczerbi<U+0144>ska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Pi<U+0142>sudski married Aleksandra. By then the pair had two little daughters, [[Wanda Pi<U+0142>sudska|Wanda]] and [[Jadwiga Pi<U+0142>sudska|Jadwiga]].

In February 1900, after Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground printing press in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], Pi<U+0142>sudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. But, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at [[Saint Petersburg]] with the help of a Polish physician, [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Mazurkiewicz (1871<U+2013>1933)|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Mazurkiewicz]], and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Pi<U+0142>sudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.<ref name=Pidl/>

On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904<U+2013>1905), in the summer of 1904, Pi<U+0142>sudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,<ref name="Urb 109<U+2013>111"/> conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|"Promethean" project]] directed at breaking up the Russian Empire<U+2014>a goal that he later continued to pursue.<ref>[[#refCharaszkiewicz2000|Charaszkiewicz 2000]], p. 56.</ref>

Another notable Pole, [[Roman Dmowski]], also traveled to Japan, where he argued against Pi<U+0142>sudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.<ref name="Urb 109<U+2013>111"/><ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Pi<U+0142>sudski's political arch-enemy to the end of Pi<U+0142>sudski's life.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> In the end, the Japanese offered Pi<U+0142>sudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Urb 109<U+2013>111"/>

In the fall of 1904 Pi<U+0142>sudski formed a paramilitary unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''boj<U+00F3>wki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on 28 October 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Pi<U+0142>sudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/><ref name="Urb 113<U+2013>116"/> Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.<ref name="Urb 117<U+2013>118"/>

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Russian Revolution]], Pi<U+0142>sudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> In June 1905, Pi<U+0142>sudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> During the "[[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> insurrection (1905)|June Days]]", as the <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Pi<U+0142>sudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> On 22 December 1905, Pi<U+0142>sudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/>

Unlike the National Democrats, Pi<U+0142>sudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].<ref name="Zamoyski-330"/> This decision, and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through uprisings, caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906 the party fractured over Pi<U+0142>sudski's leadership.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> His faction came to be called the "Old Faction" or "Revolutionary Faction" ("''Starzy''" or "''[[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Frakcja Rewolucyjna|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''"), while their opponents were known as the "Young Faction", "Moderate Faction" or "Left Wing" ("''M<U+0142>odzi''", "''Frakcja Umiarkowana''", "''[[Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Lewica|Lewica]]''"). The "Young" sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that priority should be given to cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the Tsarist regime and creating a socialist [[utopia]] that would facilitate negotiations for independence.<ref name="PWN"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> By 1909 his faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Pi<U+0142>sudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders up to the outbreak of the First World War.<ref name="Urb 131"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski anticipated a coming European war<ref name="Roos"/><ref name="JR45"/> and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Pi<U+0142>sudski, with the connivance of Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] for the training of paramilitary units.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, while the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/><ref name="Urb 121<U+2013>122"/>

The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian [[mail train]] carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilnius, used the funds thus "expropriated" to finance his secret military organization.<ref name="Britannica" /> The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.<ref name="Urb 121<U+2013>122"/>

In 1908 Pi<U+0142>sudski transformed his paramilitary units into an "Association for Active Struggle" (''[[Zwi<U+0105>zek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> One of the ''ZWC'''s main purposes was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.<ref name="PWN"/>

In 1910 two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland <U+2013> one in Lw<U+00F3>w (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine) and one in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] <U+2013> to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian authorities, Pi<U+0142>sudski founded a series of "sporting clubs", then the [[Zwi<U+0105>zek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], which served as cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912 Pi<U+0142>sudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', "''Mieczys<U+0142>aw''") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Zwi<U+0105>zek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Zamoyski-332"/> In 1914, Pi<U+0142>sudski declared that "Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation."<ref name="Zamoyski-332"/>

===World War I===
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski3.jpg|thumb|right|Pi<U+0142>sudski in uniform]]
{{Main|World War I}}
At a meeting in Paris in 1914, Pi<U+0142>sudski presciently declared that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the United States.<ref name="Roos"/><ref name="JR45"/> By contrast, [[Roman Dmowski]], Pi<U+0142>sudski's rival, believed that the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the [[Triple Entente]] against the Central Powers.<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/>
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pi<U+0142>sudski in World War I (1914)]]
At the outbreak of World War I, on 3 August in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], Pi<U+0142>sudski formed a small [[cadre]] military unit, the [[First Cadre Company]], from members of the [[Riflemen's Association]] and [[Polish Rifle Squads]].<ref name="Urb 171<U+2013>172"/><ref name="PolPrzem"/> That same day, a cavalry unit under [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Belina-Pra<U+017C>mowski]] was sent to [[reconnoitre]] across the Russian border, even before the official [[declaration of war]] between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.<ref name="Urb 168"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], into an area which the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]] had evacuated, in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a national uprising.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> Using his limited forces, in those early days he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious "National Government in Warsaw",<ref name="Urb 174<U+2013>175"/> and bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns, while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations.<ref name="Urb 178<U+2013>179"/> On 12 August 1914 Pi<U+0142>sudski's forces took the town of [[Kielce]], of [[Kielce Governorate]], but Pi<U+0142>sudski found the populace less supportive than he had expected.<ref name="Urb 170<U+2013>171 and 180<U+2013>182"/>

Soon afterward he officially established the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], taking personal command of their [[I Brigade of the Polish Legions|First Brigade]],<ref name="Poland.gov"/> which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.<ref name="PWN"/> He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.<ref name="Cienciala"/>
[[File:Pilsudski and officers 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Pi<U+0142>sudski and his officers, 1915]]
Pi<U+0142>sudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the [[French Revolution|French-Revolution]]-inspired "Citizen" (''Obywatel''), and he himself was referred to as "the Commandant" ("''Komendant''").<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/> which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia at the side of the Central Powers until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Pi<U+0142>sudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/>
[[File:MalczewskiJacek.1916.PortretJozefaPilsudskiego.jpg|thumb|Pi<U+0142>sudski. Painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]], 1916]]
In mid-1916, after the [[Battle of Kostiuchn<U+00F3>wka]] (4<U+2013>6 July 1916), in which the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties,<ref>[[#refMatuszak2006|Matuszak 2006]], p. 12.</ref> Pi<U+0142>sudski demanded that the Central Powers issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He backed this demand with his own proffered [[resignation]] and that of many of the Legions' officers.<ref name="Urb 251<U+2013>252"/> On 5 November 1916 the Central Powers proclaimed the "independence" of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|eastern front]] against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the [[Western Front (World War I)|western front]].<ref name="Britannica" /><ref name="Biskupski"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski agreed to serve in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916<U+2013>1918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]] created by the Central Powers, and acted as [[minister of war]] in the newly formed [[Polish Regency government]]; as such he was responsible for the [[Polnische Wehrmacht]].<ref name="Zamoyski-333"/> After the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution in early 1917]], and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Pi<U+0142>sudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as "German [[colonial troops]]" and only be used to fight Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.<ref name="JR45"/><ref name="Urb 253"/> In the aftermath of a July 1917 "[[Oath Crisis]]" when Pi<U+0142>sudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear an [[loyalty oath|oath of loyalty]] to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded, and the men were incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]],<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.<ref name="PWN"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, willing to take on ''all'' the partitioning powers.<ref name="PWN"/>

On 8 November 1918, three days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]], Pi<U+0142>sudski and his colleague, Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon<U+2014>like [[Lenin]] before them<U+2014>placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Pi<U+0142>sudski would create a force friendly to them.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

===Rebuilding Poland===
[[File:Ulica Mokotowska 50, Warsaw.JPG|thumb|right|''Ulica Mokotowska 50'', Warsaw, where Pi<U+0142>sudski stayed 13<U+2013>29 November 1918, after his release from [[Magdeburg]]]]
On 11 November 1918, in Warsaw, Pi<U+0142>sudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. On that very day (which would become [[Poland's Independence Day]]), he proclaimed an independent Polish state.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

That week, too, Pi<U+0142>sudski also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the "[[Ober Ost]]" authority. Over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In coming months, over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="Urb 256 and 277<U+2013>278"/>

On 14 November 1918 Pi<U+0142>sudski was asked to provisionally supervise the running of the country. On 22 November he officially received, from the new government of [[J<U+0119>drzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Pa<U+0144>stwa'') of renascent Poland.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the [[Regency Council]] in Warsaw; [[Ignacy Daszy<U+0144>ski]]'s government in [[Lublin]]; and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]) bowed to Pi<U+0142>sudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education, and [[women's suffrage]]. This was necessary to avoid major unrest.

However, Pi<U+0142>sudski believed that as head of state he must be above partisan politics.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Cienciala"/> The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as "[[Comrade]]" ("''Towarzysz''") and asked his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: "Comrades, I took the red [[tram|streetcar]] of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as '[[Mr.|Mister']] [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!"<ref name="Poland.gov"/> He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Suleja202"/> He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after World War I, Pi<U+0142>sudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.<ref name="MM-210"/> A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".<ref name="MM-210"/>

In addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.<ref name="MM-210"/>
[[File:Warszawaid4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Pi<U+0142>sudski before Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Pi<U+0142>sudski's official residence during his years in power]]

[[Wac<U+0142>aw J<U+0119>drzejewicz]], in ''Pi<U+0142>sudski: A Life for Poland'', describes Pi<U+0142>sudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Pi<U+0142>sudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night.<ref name="MM-210"/> He maintained a [[sparta]]n lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.<ref name="MM-210"/> Though Pi<U+0142>sudski was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.<ref name="MM-209"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because Pi<U+0142>sudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914<U+2013>17 and because the governments of Daszy<U+0144>ski and J<U+0119>drzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.<ref name="Cienciala"/> It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister]] and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Pi<U+0142>sudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in Paris.<ref name="MM-210"/> To ensure that Poland have a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Pi<U+0142>sudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Pi<U+0142>sudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and [[Commander-in-Chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref name="MM-213<U+2013>214"/> Articles 87<U+2013>93 of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]]<ref name="The Versailles Treaty 28 June 1919: Part III"/> and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.<ref>[[#refGrant1999|Grant 1999]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=GAQ8vIJE8_QC&pg=PA114 p. 114].</ref>

Pi<U+0142>sudski often clashed with Dmowski, at variance with the latter's vision of the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and irked by Dmowski's attempt to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now [[Gda<U+0144>sk]], Poland).<ref name="MM-211 and 214"/><ref name="BFG"/> On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters ([[Marian Januszajtis-<U+017B>egota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a coup]] against Pi<U+0142>sudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but failed.<ref name="Urb 499<U+2013>501"/>

On 20 February 1919 Pi<U+0142>sudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''[[Sejm]]''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the [[Little Constitution of 1919]]. The word "Provisional" was struck from his title, and Pi<U+0142>sudski would hold the office until 9 December 1922, when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected the first [[president of Poland]].<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski's major foreign-policy initiative at this time was a proposed federation (to be called "[[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze]]", [[Polish language|Polish]] for "Between-Seas", and also known from the [[Latin]] as "[[Intermarum]]", stretching from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]]) of Poland with the independent [[Baltic states]] and [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]],<ref name="Cienciala"/> somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="PWN"/><ref>[[#refJedrzejewicz1991|J<U+0119>drzejewicz 1991]].</ref>

Pi<U+0142>sudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states<U+2014>who refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence<U+2014>as well as from the Allied powers, for whom it would be too bold a change to the existing [[Balance of power in international relations|balance-of-power]] structure.<ref name="Polish-Soviet War: Battle of Warsaw"/> According to historian [[George Sanford (scholar)|George Sanford]], around 1920 Pi<U+0142>sudski came to realize the infeasibility of this version of his [[Intermarum]] project.<ref name="Sanford"/>

Instead of a Central- and East-European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] (1918<U+2013>19), the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] (1920, culminating in [[<U+017B>eligowski's Mutiny]]), [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts]] (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919<U+2013>21).<ref name="PWN"/> [[Winston Churchill]] commented: "The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begun."<ref name="AHP"/>

===Polish-Soviet War===
{{Main|Polish-Soviet War}}
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|right|Pi<U+0142>sudski in [[Pozna<U+0144>]]]]
In the [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Pi<U+0142>sudski said, "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente<U+2014>on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany", while in the east "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far."<ref name="MM-211"/> In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish-Ukrainian War, and Pi<U+0142>sudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the [[Battle of Lw<U+00F3>w (1918)|Polish struggle in Lviv]].<ref name="Urb 281"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland, and that war with them was inevitable.<ref name="Urb 90<U+2013>2"/> He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|Russian Civil War opponents]].<ref name="Kenez"/> These "White Russians"<U+2014>representative of the old Russian Empire<U+2014>were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former [[Congress Poland]], and clearly objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Pi<U+0142>sudski's ''[[Intermarum]]'' project.<ref name="Urb 83<U+2013>2"/>

This was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.<ref name="Urb 291"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.<ref name="Kenez"/><ref name="Urb 45<U+2013>2"/> By ignoring the strong pressures from the [[Entente Cordiale]] to join the attack on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s struggling [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government, Pi<U+0142>sudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.<ref name="Urb 92<U+2013>2"/>

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In March 1920, Pi<U+0142>sudski was made "First [[Marshal of Poland]]".]]
In the wake of the [[Russian westward offensive of 1918<U+2013>1919]] and of a series of escalating battles which resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, [[Marshal]] Pi<U+0142>sudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]) with Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]] to conduct joint operations against [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]]. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine in alliance with Poland.<ref name="Davies_WERS-99-103pl"/> In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|eastern Galicia]], for which he was denounced by eastern-Galician Ukrainian leaders.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

The Polish and Ukrainian armies, under Pi<U+0142>sudski's command, launched [[1920 Kiev Offensive|a successful offensive]] against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured [[Kiev]].<ref name="Davies_WERS"/>

The Bolshevik leadership framed the Polish actions as an invasion; in response, thousands of officers and deserters joined the army, and thousands of civilians volunteered for war work.<ref>[[#refFiges1996|Figes 1996]], p. 699. "Within weeks of Brusilov's appointment, 14,000 officers had joined the army to fight the Poles, thousands of civilians had volunteered for war-work, and well over 100,000 deserters had returned to the Red Army on the Western Front."</ref> The Soviets launched a counter-offensive from [[Belarus]] and [[counter-attack]]ed in Ukraine, advancing into Poland<ref name="Davies_WERS"/> in a drive toward Germany to encourage the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] in its struggle to take power. Soviet confidence soared.<ref name="LeninSpeach"/> The Soviets announced their plans to invade western Europe; Soviet communist theoretician [[Nicholas Bukharin|Nikolai Bukharin]], writing in ''[[Pravda]]'', hoped for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw "straight to London and Paris".<ref name="Cohen"/> Soviet General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s order of the day for 2 July 1920, read: "To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March upon [[Vilnius]], [[Minsk]], Warsaw!"<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/> and "onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!"<ref name="Cienciala"/>

On 1 July 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the ''[[Sejm]]'', formed a [[Council for Defense of the Nation]]. It was chaired by Pi<U+0142>sudski and was to provide expeditious decision-making and temporarily supplant the fractious [[Sejm]].<ref name="Urb 341<U+2013>346 and 357<U+2013>358"/> The [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Pi<U+0142>sudski's fault<ref name="Suleja265"/> and demanded that he resign; some even accused him of treason.<ref name="Urb 341<U+2013>346"/> Their 19 July failure to carry a [[vote of no-confidence]] in the council led to [[Roman Dmowski]]'s withdrawal from it.<ref name="Urb 341<U+2013>346"/> On 12 August Pi<U+0142>sudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]], offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation.<ref name="Urb 341<U+2013>346"/> The [[Triple Entente|Entente]] pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Pi<U+0142>sudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.<ref name="Urb 341<U+2013>346"/> As [[Norman Davies]] noted, at that time, especially abroad, "Pi<U+0142>sudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All&nbsp;<U+2013> from [[Lenin]] to [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], from ''[[Pravda]]'' to ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]''&nbsp;<U+2013> considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw."<ref name="Davies_WERS229"/>
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski with Kasztanka.jpg|thumb|left|Pi<U+0142>sudski with his favorite horse, ''[[Kasztanka|Chestnut]]'' (''Kasztanka'')]]
Yet over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] halted the Soviet advance.<ref name="Davies_WERS"/> The Polish plan was developed by Pi<U+0142>sudski and others, including [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]].<ref name="Eric"/> Later, some supporters of Pi<U+0142>sudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, while opponents would seek to minimize his role.<ref name="Nobel"/> In the West for a long time a myth persisted that it was General [[Maxime Weygand]] of the [[French military mission to Poland]] who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal at best.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="Nobel"/><ref name="Szczep"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the [[Vistula River]] and defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the [[Wieprz River]], while some 25% of available [[division (military)|divisions]] concentrated to the south for a strategic counter-offensive. The plan next required two armies under General [[J<U+00F3>zef Haller de Hallenburg|J<U+00F3>zef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled "Reserve Army" (also known as the "Strike Group", "''Grupa Uderzeniowa''"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units and commanded personally by Pi<U+0142>sudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.<ref name="Cisek"/><ref name="Urb 346<U+2013>441"/>

At the time Pi<U+0142>sudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were quick to point out Pi<U+0142>sudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Soviet commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] thought it a ruse and disregarded it.<ref name="Davies_WERS_197"/> Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], the overconfident [[Red Army]] suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.<ref name="Davies_WERS"/><ref name="Urb 346<U+2013>441"/>

A [[National Democracy|National Democrat]] ''[[Sejm]]'' deputy, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Stro<U+0144>ski]], coined the phrase, "Miracle at the Vistula" ("''Cud nad Wis<U+0142><U+0105>''"),<ref name="G<U+0142>os">{{cite journal|last=Fr<U+0105>tczak|first=S<U+0142>awomir Z.|language=Polish|url=http://www.glos.com.pl/Archiwum_nowe/Rok+2005/032/strona/Cud.html |journal=[[G<U+0142>os (1991)|G<U+0142>os]]|issue=32/2005|year=2005|title=Cud nad Wis<U+0142><U+0105>|accessdate=26 June 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070708173639/http://www.glos.com.pl/Archiwum_nowe/Rok+2005/032/strona/Cud.html |archivedate = 8 July 2007}}</ref> to express his disapproval of Pi<U+0142>sudski's "Ukrainian adventure". Stro<U+0144>ski's phrase was adopted as praise for Pi<U+0142>sudski by some patriotically or piously minded Poles, who were unaware of Stro<U+0144>ski's ironic intent. A junior member of the French military mission, [[Charles de Gaulle]], would later adopt some lessons from the Polish-Soviet War as well as from Pi<U+0142>sudski's career.<ref name="Urb 346<U+2013>441"/><ref name="Davies_E"/>

In February 1921 Pi<U+0142>sudski visited Paris, where in negotiations with French president [[Alexandre Millerand]] he laid the foundations for the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]] that would be signed later that year.<ref name="Urb 484"/> The [[Treaty of Riga]], which ended the Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, partitioned [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] between Poland and Russia. Pi<U+0142>sudski called the treaty an "act of cowardice".<ref name="Davies_GP2-399"/> The treaty, and Pi<U+0142>sudski-approved General [[Lucjan <U+017B>eligowski]]'s [[<U+017B>eligowski's Mutiny|capture of Vilnius]] from the Lithuanians, marked an end to this incarnation of Pi<U+0142>sudski's federalist ''[[Intermarum]]'' plan.<ref name="PWN"/>

On 25 September 1921, when Pi<U+0142>sudski visited Lw<U+00F3>w (now [[Lviv]]) for the opening of the first [[Eastern Trade Fair]] (''Targi Wschodnie''), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by [[Stepan Fedak]], acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]].<ref name="Urb 485"/>

After the Polish [[March Constitution|Constitution of March 1921]] severely limited the powers of the [[presidency]] (intentionally, to prevent a President Pi<U+0142>sudski from waging war), Pi<U+0142>sudski declined to run for the office.<ref name="PWN"/> On 9 December 1922 the Polish [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] elected [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] of ''[[Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe Wyzwolenie|PSL Wyzwolenie]]''; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest.<ref name="Urb 487-488"/> On 14 December at the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Pi<U+0142>sudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the ''Naczelnik'' was replaced by the President.<ref name="Urb 488"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia

Two days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]], who had originally wanted to kill Pi<U+0142>sudski but had changed his target, influenced by [[National Democracy|National-Democrat]] anti-Narutowicz propaganda.<ref name="Urb 489"/>

For Pi<U+0142>sudski this was a major shock, an event that shook his belief that Poland could function as a democracy<ref name="Suleja300"/> and made him favor government by a strong hand.<ref>[[#refDavies1986|Davies 1986]], p. 140.</ref> He became [[Chief of the General Staff (Poland)|Chief of the General Staff]] and, together with [[Polish Minister of Military Affairs|Minister of Military Affairs]] [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]], managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief [[state of emergency]].<ref name="Urb 489<U+2013>490"/>

[[Stanis<U+0142>aw Wojciechowski]] of ''[[Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe Piast|PSL Piast]]'', another of Pi<U+0142>sudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and [[Wincenty Witos]], also of ''PSL Piast'', became prime minister. But the new government<U+2014>pursuant to the [[Lanckorona Pact]], an alliance among the centrist ''PSL Piast'' and the right-wing [[National Populist Union]] and [[Polskie Stronnictwo Chrze<U+015B>cija<U+0144>skiej Demokracji|Christian Democrat]] parties<U+2014>contained right-wing enemies of Pi<U+0142>sudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and whom he found it impossible to work with.<ref name="Urb 490<U+2013>491"/> On 30 May 1923, Pi<U+0142>sudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.

After General [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Szeptycki]] proposed that the military should be more closely supervised by civilian authorities, Pi<U+0142>sudski criticized this as an attempt to politicize the army, and on 28 June he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted a resolution thanking him for his past work.<ref name="Urb 490"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski went into retirement in [[Sulej<U+00F3>wek]], outside Warsaw, at his country manor, ''"Milusin"'', which had been presented to him by his former soldiers.<ref>[[#refWatt1979|Watt 1979]], p. 210.</ref> There he settled down to supporting his family by writing a series of political and military memoirs, including ''Rok 1920'' (The Year 1920).<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Meanwhile Poland's economy was in shambles. [[Hyperinflation]] fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis.<ref name="Urb 502"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centered around former members of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] and the [[Polish Military Organization]] as well as some left-wing and [[intelligentsia]] parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Pi<U+0142>sudski became more and more critical of the government, eventually issuing statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref name="PWN"/>

When the [[Chjeno-Piast]] coalition, which Pi<U+0142>sudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,<ref name="PWN"/> on 12<U+2013>14 May 1926, Pi<U+0142>sudski returned to power in a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' (the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]]), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, [[PSL Wyzwolenie|Liberation]], the [[Stronnictwo Ch<U+0142>opskie|Peasant Party]], and even the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]].<ref name="Urb 515"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down;<ref name="Suleja343"/> 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.<ref>[[#refRoszkowski1992|Roszkowski 1992]], p. 53, section 5.1.</ref>

On 31 May the ''[[Sejm]]'' elected Pi<U+0142>sudski president of the Republic. Pi<U+0142>sudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, [[Ignacy Mo<U+015B>cicki]], was elected in his stead. Pi<U+0142>sudski's formal offices<U+2014>apart from two terms as prime minister in 1926<U+2013>28 and 1930<U+2014>would for the most part remain limited to those of [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|Minister of Military Affairs]], [[General Inspector of the Armed Forces]], and Chairman of The War Council.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

===Dictatorship===
Pi<U+0142>sudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters, declaring that his coup was to be a "revolution without revolutionary consequences".<ref name="PWN"/> His goals were to stabilize the country, reduce the influence of political parties, which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency, and strengthen the army.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Urb 528<U+2013>529"/>

====Internal politics====
[[File:5 Warszawa 083.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Warsaw, Pi<U+0142>sudski's official residence during his years in power]]

In internal politics, Pi<U+0142>sudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his [[Sanacja|Sanation]] regime (1926<U+2013>1939)<U+2014>at times employing authoritarian methods<U+2014>sought to "restore public life to moral health". From 1928 the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the [[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR''). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Pi<U+0142>sudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled by the president, who was appointed by Pi<U+0142>sudski, not by the ''[[Sejm]]''.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> The powers of the ''Sejm'' were curtailed by [[August Novelization|constitutional amendments]] introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926.<ref name="Poland.gov"/> From 1926 to 1930, Pi<U+0142>sudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.<ref name="PWN"/>

The culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in the 1930s with the imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents (the [[Brest trial]]s) on the eve of the 1930 [[Polish legislative election, 1930|legislative elections]], and with the 1934 establishment of a [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp|prison]] for political prisoners at Bereza Kartuska (today [[Biaroza]]),<ref name="PWN"/> where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.<ref>

[[File:Aleksandra Pi<U+0142>sudska.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshal and his second wife, [[Aleksandra Pi<U+0142>sudska]], in later life]]
Pi<U+0142>sudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland.<ref name="Cohen2"/> His intemperate public utterances<U+2014>he called the ''[[Sejm]]'' a "prostitute"<U+2013>and his sending ninety armed officers into the ''Sejm'' building in response to an impending [[vote of no-confidence]], caused concern in contemporary and modern-day observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges.<ref name="Pilsudski Bros."/><ref name="Pilsudski v. Daszynski"/><ref name="Visions of the Past Are Competing for Votes in Poland"/>

One of Pi<U+0142>sudski's main goals was to transform the [[parliamentary system]] into a [[presidential system]]; however, he opposed the introduction of [[totalitarianism]].<ref name="PWN"/> The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935, tailored by Pi<U+0142>sudski's supporters to his specifications<U+2014>providing for a strong presidency<U+2014>came too late for Pi<U+0142>sudski to seek that office; but the [[April Constitution]] would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its [[Polish Government in Exile|Government in Exile]] through to the end of the war and beyond.

Nonetheless, Pi<U+0142>sudski's government depended more on his [[charismatic authority]] than on [[rational-legal authority]].<ref name="PWN"/> None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death the [[Sanacja|Sanation]] structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Pi<U+0142>sudski era of parliamentary political contention.<ref name="PWN"/>

During the 1930s, a combination of developments, from the [[Great Depression]]<ref name="Snyder"/> to the [[vicious spiral]] of ''[[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]'' terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate.<ref name="Snyder"/><ref name="Davies_GP2-407"/> Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and Poland's German minority, particularly in [[Upper Silesia]]. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Pi<U+0142>sudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.<ref>[[#refLeslie1983|Leslie 1983]], p. 182.</ref>

In the military sphere, Pi<U+0142>sudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the "[[Miracle at the Vistula]]", has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment.<ref name="PWN"/><ref name="Garlicki178"/> His experiences in the Polish-Soviet War (1919<U+2013>21) may have led him to overestimate the importance of cavalry and to neglect the development of armored and air forces.<ref name="Garlicki178"/> Others, however, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he did support the development of these military branches.<ref name="Urb 330<U+2013>337-2"/> The limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial.

====Foreign policy====
[[File:Pilsudski by Kossak portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal Pi<U+0142>sudski, painted by [[Wojciech Kossak]], 1928]]
Under Pi<U+0142>sudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], Hungary and [[Latvia]]. Relations were strained with [[Czechoslovakia]], however, and were still worse with [[Lithuania]].<ref name="Goldstein-29"/> Relations with [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] varied over time, but during Pi<U+0142>sudski's tenure could for the most part be described as neutral.<ref name="Urb 538"/><ref name="Ilya Prizel"/><ref name="Urb 539<U+2013>540"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program, designed to weaken the Russian Empire and its [[successor state]], the [[Soviet Union]], by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the [[military intelligence]] officer, [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]. In the [[Interbellum]], the Prometheist movement yielded few tangible results.<ref name="Char"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]] [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]], he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers such as France and the United Kingdom, and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbors such as Romania and Hungary.<ref name="Urb 539<U+2013>540"/>

A supporter of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]] (part of the [[Little Entente]]), Pi<U+0142>sudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of [[appeasement]] evident in those countries' signing of the [[Locarno Treaties]].<ref name="Ilya Prizel"/><ref name="JLu"/><ref name="NJ"/> Pi<U+0142>sudski therefore aimed also to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]], and the 1934 [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].<ref name="Urb 539<U+2013>540"/> The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.<ref name="Poland.gov"/>

Pi<U+0142>sudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the pacts, and commented: "Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first, and when that will be."<ref>[[#refKipp1993|Kipp 1993]], [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0714645451&id=__zem3Mlm8AC&pg=PA95 p. 95].</ref> Critics of the two non-aggression pacts have accused Pi<U+0142>sudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness<ref>[[#refHehn2005|Hehn 2005]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=nOALhEZkYDkC&pg=PA76 p. 76].</ref> and of giving Germany time to rearm;<ref>[[#refKershaw2001|Kershaw 2001]].</ref><ref>[[#refDavidson2004|Davidson 2004]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=qncE3wy3TTsC&pg=PA25 p. 25].</ref> and of allowing Stalin to eliminate opposition<U+2014>primarily in Ukraine<U+2014>that had been supported by Pi<U+0142>sudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program.<ref name="A Cold War in Miniature: The Polish-Soviet Secret War for Ukraine, 1926<U+2013>1939"/>

After [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in January 1933, Pi<U+0142>sudski is rumored to have proposed to France a [[preventive war]] against Germany. It has been argued that Pi<U+0142>sudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany.<ref name="Urb 317<U+2013>326-2"/> Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of January 1934.<ref name="TT_NGP"/><ref name="Urb 539<U+2013>540"/><ref name="GQH"/><ref name="Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica"/> Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.<ref name="Bel"/>

Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Pi<U+0142>sudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with Germany or with the Soviet Union.<ref name="Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica"/><ref name="Hildebrand"/> Hitler, who admired Pi<U+0142>sudski's leadership and his successful coup,<ref>[[Peter D.

Just before his death, Pi<U+0142>sudski told [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]] that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany and keep up the Polish alliance with France, and to improve relations with the United Kingdom.<ref name="Urb 539<U+2013>540"/>

The huge black tombstone is inscribed: "''Matka i serce syna''"<br /> ("The mother and the heart of [her] son") and bears evocative lines from a poem by [[Juliusz S<U+0142>owacki|S<U+0142>owacki]].]]
By 1935, unbeknown to the public, Pi<U+0142>sudski had for several years been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] at Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]]. The celebration of his life had begun spontaneously within half an hour after his death had been announced.<ref name="Pozeg5"/> It was led by military personnel<U+2014>former [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legionnaires]], members of the [[Polish Military Organization]], veterans of the wars of 1919<U+2013>21, and his political collaborators from his time as Chief of State and, later, prime minister and the general inspector.<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/>

The [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]] immediately attacked Pi<U+0142>sudski as a fascist and capitalist,<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/> despite the fact that fascists themselves did not see him this way.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=SwMOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=%22a+liberal+democrat+in+the+clothes+of+an+old-world+knight.%22&source=bl&ots=wwxy3WRgEl&sig=Ok3awKVR6URUy-YX_7C3M14ENXw&hl=en&ei=PvVrTPeCM4GsOJTuqZ0B&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20liberal%20democrat%20in%20the%20clothes%20of%20an%20old-world%20knight.%22&f=false Ideas into politics: aspects of European history 1880<U+2013>1950] R. J. Bullen, Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, A. B. Polonsky, Taylor & Francis, 1984, p. 138</ref> Other opponents of the [[sanacja|Sanation]] regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as [[Ignacy Daszy<U+0144>ski]] and [[Tomasz Arciszewski]]) and [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]] (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Wojciechowski]] and [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Grabski]]) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions ([[Wincenty Witos]] voicing criticism of Pi<U+0142>sudski, but [[Maciej Rataj]] and [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Thugutt]] being supportive), while [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] expressed a toned-down criticism.<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/>

Condolences were expressed by Polish Catholic clergy<U+2014>by [[primate of Poland|Poland's Primate]] [[August Hlond]]<U+2014>as well as by [[Pope Pius XI]], who called himself a "personal friend" of the Marshal.<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/> Notable appreciation for Pi<U+0142>sudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], Protestant, [[Judaism|Judaic]] and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Pi<U+0142>sudski for his policies of religious tolerance.<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/> His death was a shock to members of the Jewish minority, who even years after remembered him as a ''very good man'' who ''protected Jews''.<ref name="Dov Weissberg, I remember, page 116"/><ref name="Interview with Holocaust survivor Cyla Wiener"/>

Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized by, in addition to the Polish communists, by the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Jewish Labour Bund]], and by Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/>

On the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony 18 May in the [[Holy See]], a commemoration was conducted at [[League of Nations]] [[Geneva]] headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from [[head of state|heads of state]] across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's [[Joseph Stalin]], Italy's [[Benito Mussolini]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], France's [[Albert Lebrun]] and [[Pierre-<U+00C9>tienne Flandin]], Austria's [[Wilhelm Miklas]], Japan's Emperor [[Hirohito]], and Britain's King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].<ref name="Pozeg9<U+2013>11"/>

Ceremonies, [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] and an enormous funeral were held; a [[funeral train]] toured Poland.<ref>[[#refHumphrey1936|Humphrey 1936]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=BNkwAAAAIAAJ&q=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&dq=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&hl=pl&pgis=1 p. 295].</ref> The Polish mint issued a silver 10-''[[z<U+0142>oty]]'' commemorative coin featuring the Marshal's profile. A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released. After a two-year display at [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], Pi<U+0142>sudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]], and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at [[Vilnius]]' [[Rasos Cemetery]], where it remains.<ref name="Poland.gov"/><ref>[[#refWatt1979|Watt 1979]], p. 338.</ref> The 1937 relocation of his remains, made by his long-standing adversary [[Adam Sapieha]], then [[Archbishop of Krakow]], incited widespread protests that included calls for Sapieha's removal.<ref name="Crowds urge Poland to banish Archbishop; Pilsudski Legionnaires also Assail Catholic Church on the Removal of Marshal's Body"/><ref name="Historical dictionary of Poland, 966<U+2013>1945"/>

On 13 May 1935, in accordance with Pi<U+0142>sudski's last wishes, [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]] was named by Poland's president and government to be [[Inspector-General]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], and on 10 November 1936, he was elevated to [[Marshal of Poland]].<ref name="JabStaw13"/> Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland<U+2014>the "second man in the state after the President".<ref name="JabStaw5"/> While many saw Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y as a successor to Pi<U+0142>sudski, he never became as influential.<ref name="JabStaw14"/>

As the Polish government became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and conservative, the Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y faction was opposed by that of the more moderate [[Ignacy Mo<U+015B>cicki]], who remained President.<ref name="JabStaw14"/> After 1938 Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the "President's Men", mostly civilians (the "Castle Group", after the President's official residence, Warsaw's [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Royal Castle]]), and the "Marshal's Men" ("[[The colonels|Pi<U+0142>sudski's Colonels]]"), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Pi<U+0142>sudski's. After the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland in 1939]], some of this political division would survive within the [[Polish government in exile]].

Pi<U+0142>sudski had given Poland something akin to what [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s [[Onufry Zag<U+0142>oba]] had mused about: a Polish [[Oliver Cromwell]]. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.<ref name="TT_NGP"/><ref name="Goldfarb"/><ref name="Pozeg6"/>

In 1935, at Pi<U+0142>sudski's funeral, President Mo<U+015B>cicki had [[eulogy|eulogized]] the Marshal: "He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life's travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit&nbsp;... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect."<ref name="Mo<U+015B><U+0107>">Translation of Mo<U+015B>cicki's speech from 1935. For Polish original online, see {{cite web

After World War II, little of Pi<U+0142>sudski's thought influenced the policies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], a ''de facto'' [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular, Poland was in no position to resume Pi<U+0142>sudski's effort to build an [[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze|''Intermarum'' federation]] of Poland and some of its neighbors; and a "[[Prometheism|Promethean]]" endeavor to "break up the Russian state into its main constituents and emancipate the countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire."<ref>Quoted in [[#refCharaszkiewicz2000|Charaszkiewicz 2000]], p. 56.</ref>

For a decade after World War II, Pi<U+0142>sudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar [[Second Polish Republic]]. This began to change, however, particularly after [[de-Stalinization]] and the [[Polish October]] (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Pi<U+0142>sudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.<ref name="nalamach"/>

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the 1991 disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]], Pi<U+0142>sudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero.<ref name="Roshwald"/> On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on 12 May 1995, Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' adopted a resolution: "J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski served his country well and has entered our history forever."<ref name="Sejm1995"/>

While some of Pi<U+0142>sudski's political moves remain controversial<U+2014>particularly the May 1926 Coup d'<U+00E9>tat, the [[Brest trial]]s (1931<U+2013>32), the 1934 establishment of the [[Bereza Kartuska detention camp]], and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive policies toward the [[national minorities]]<ref>[[#refCharaszkiewicz2000|Charaszkiewicz 2000]], pp. 66<U+2013>67.</ref><U+2014>Pi<U+0142>sudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.

Pi<U+0142>sudski has lent his name to several military units, including the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legions Infantry Division]] and [[armored train]] No. 51 ("''I Marsza<U+0142>ek''"<U+2014>"the First Marshal").<ref name="PIBWL"/>

Virtually every Polish city has its "Pi<U+0142>sudski Street". (There are, by contrast, few if any streets named after Pi<U+0142>sudski's [[National Democracy|National-Democrat]] arch-rival, [[Roman Dmowski]]<U+2014>even in Dmowski's old [[Greater Poland|Greater-Poland]] political stronghold). There are statues of Pi<U+0142>sudski in many Polish cities; the highest density of such [[statuary]] memorials is found in Warsaw, which has three over the span of little more than a mile joining the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Pi<U+0142>sudski's residence, with [[Pi<U+0142>sudski Square]].

He was the subject of paintings by renowned artists such as [[Jacek Malczewski]] (1916) and [[Wojciech Kossak]] (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, ''[[Kasztanka]]'', 1928), as well as the subject of numerous caricatures and photos.

Pi<U+0142>sudski has been a character in numerous works of fiction, such as the 1922 novel ''Genera<U+0142> Barcz'' (General Barcz) by [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]] and the 2007 novel ''[[Ice (Dukaj novel)|Ice]]'' (''L<U+00F3>d'') by [[Jacek Dukaj]].

Plans are being considered to turn Pi<U+0142>sudski's official residence, the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], which currently houses a small exhibit about him, into a full-fledged museum devoted to his memory.

'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} J<U+00F3>zef Klemens Pi<U+0142>sudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as "J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski", A few English sources translate his first name as "Joseph", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including "''Wiktor''", "''Mieczys<U+0142>aw''" and "''Ziuk''" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called "''Dziadek''" ("Grandpa" or "the Old Man") and "''Marsza<U+0142>ek''" ("the Marshal"). His ex-soldiers from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legions]] also referred to him as "''Komendant''" ("the Commandant").
