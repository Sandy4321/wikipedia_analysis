==History==
===Beginnings and ''Half Hour of Power'' (1996<U+2013>2000)===
[[File:Sum41 Deryck Whibley.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Deryck Whibley during a show]]
Sum 41 was formed by singer-songwriter Deryck Whibley and drummer Steve Jocz, after Whibley convinced Jocz to join his band. Jocz was a drummer in another band and Whibley was convinced that "he was the best drummer around". The duo then added [[Dave Baksh]] as lead guitarist a year later and after going through several bassists, ended up picking McCaslin to complete their lineup.<ref>{{cite web|author=18 februari 2010 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd4zA1P_C1E |title=SUM 41 STUDIO UPDATE 18 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>

In 1998, the band recorded a [[1998 demo tape|demo tape]] on [[Compact Cassette]] which they sent to record companies in the hope of getting a recording contract. These [[demo (music)|demo tapes]] are rare and are the only recordings known with the original bassist, Richard Roy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sum 41-B-sides and rarities list | publisher=Theresnosolution.com | url =http://www.theresnosolution.com/en/index.php?section=music_bsidesandrarities | accessdate = 2008-10-16}}</ref>

From 1999 to 2000, the band recorded several new songs. The ''[[Introduction to Destruction]]'' and later the ''[[Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's]]'' DVDs both contained the self-recorded footage, which contained their performing a dance to "[[Makes No Difference]]" in front of a theater.

Sum 41 released the [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Half Hour of Power]]'' on June 27, 2000. The first [[single (music)|single]] released by the band was "[[Makes No Difference]]", which had two different [[music video]]s. The first video was put together using the video clips sent to the record label and the second showed the band performing at a house party.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sum 41 Bio | date=2007 | publisher=[[Viacom]]|work=[[VH1|VH1.com]] | url =http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/sum_41/bio.jhtml | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> The EP was certified gold in Canada. Following the success of the EP, the band began working on their first full-length album.

Sum 41's first full-length album, ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', was released on May 8, 2001. "[[Fat Lip]]", the album's first single, achieved significant chart and commercial success; it topped the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart as well as many other charts around the world.<ref name="Billboard.com">{{cite news | title=Billboard.com -Artist Chart History- Sum 41 | publisher=Billboard.com | url =http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.

"In Too Deep" peaked at #10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, while "Motivation" peaked at #24 on the same chart. The album peaked at #13 on the [[Billboard 200]] chart and at #9 on the [[Top Canadian Albums]] chart. While critical reception was mixed, the album was a commercial success, and was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the United States, Canada and in the UK.

The success of the album brought the band touring offers with mainstream punk rock bands like [[Blink 182]] and [[The Offspring]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/1130-sum-41-biography |title=Sum 41 Biography &#124; Bio &#124; Pictures &#124; Brown &#124; Bizzy D &#124; Sound &#124; Stevo 32 &#124; Cone &#124; Pic &#124; |publisher=Kidzworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref> The band spent much of 2001 touring; they played over 300 concerts that year before returning to the studio to record another album.

The album was certified platinum in Canada and gold in the United States, but was not as successful as its predecessor.

The first single released from the album was "[[Still Waiting (Sum 41 song)|Still Waiting]]", which peaked at #7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, "[[The Hell Song]]" peaked at #13 on the chart. "The Hell Song"'s music video depicted the band using dolls with their pictures on them and others, such as [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Pamela Anderson]]. The third single, "[[Over My Head (Better Off Dead)]]", had a video released exclusively in Canada and on their website, featuring live shots of the band. The video also appeared on their live DVD, ''[[Sake Bombs And Happy Endings]]'' (2003), as a bonus feature. The band again commenced on a long tour to promote the album before recording their third studio album.

A [[United Nations|U.N.]] peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier, called for armored carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly six hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety.

In honor of Pelletier, Sum 41 named their next album ''[[Chuck (album)|Chuck]]''; it was released on October 12, 2004. The album is the band's heaviest and most serious album to date, and charted at #10 on the Billboard 200 chart and on the [[Top Internet Albums]] chart. It also peaked at #2 on the Canadian Albums chart and was the band's highest-charting album until it was surpassed by ''Underclass Hero''. ''Chuck'' received generally positive reviews, and was certified platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/1005_g.php |title=Gold & Platinum Certification - October 2005 |publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] |accessdate=2010-05-11 }}</ref><ref name="riaa">[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH "RIAA Database Search for Sum 41"] ''[[Recording Industry Association of America]]''.

The first single from the album was "[[We're All To Blame]]", which peaked at #10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was followed by "[[Pieces (Sum 41 song)|Pieces]]", a relatively soft song which reached the top of the charts in Canada. The next single was "[[Some Say]]", released only in Canada and Japan. The last single off the record was "[[No Reason]]", released at the same time as "Some Say", but with no music video and was only released in Europe and the USA, where it reached #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart.<ref name="Billboard.com"/>

A documentary of their experience in Congo was made into a film called ''[[Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo]]'' and later aired on [[MTV]]. War Child released it on DVD on November 29, 2005, in the United States and Canada.

On December 21, 2005, Sum 41 released a [[live album]], ''[[Happy Live Surprise]]'', in Japan. The CD contained a full concert recorded live from [[London, Ontario]] and was produced by Whibley. The same CD was released March 7, 2006, in Canada under the name ''[[Go Chuck Yourself]]''.

On May 11, 2006, [[Dave Baksh]] announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, [[Brown Brigade]], which has a more "classic metal" sound.

On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on [[iTunes]], "[[March of the Dogs]]". Although not a single, the band released it early because, according to Whibley, "the record [wouldn't] be out until the summer". Whibley was threatened with deportation for the song, because he metaphorically "killed the [[George W.

In October 2007, the band began the ''Strength In Numbers Tour'', a tour of Canada with Canadian band [[Finger Eleven]]; [[Die Mannequin]] opened each of Sum 41's shows. During the tour, Whibley sustained a [[herniated disk]].

Afterward, they would begin working on the band's next [[studio album]]. McCaslin worked on the second album by his side-project, [[The Operation M.D.]].

Sum 41 released a press release that mentioned that following the success of ''Underclass Hero'', ''Universal Music'' picked up the option to have Sum 41 produce an EP in 2009. However, Deryck stated that the new EP was quickly turning into an LP due to the amount of music they had recorded, which was more than what they had initially planned. The band entered the studio in late 2008 for a plan to release the album sometime during 2009, with a supporting tour in the summer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Press Release | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.islandrecords.com/site/artist_newsinfo.php?artist_id=259&uf_item_id=1-106431 |accessdate = 2008-10-29}}</ref>

On March 17, 2010, the band finished recording all instruments for the new album, with only vocals left to be tracked by [[Deryck Whibley]] at his own home studio.

==Other projects==
===Internet videos===
[[Image:ConeMcaslin.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cone during a show]]
Touring in support of ''Chuck'', Sum 41 played videos before their set which were deemed "unsuitable for children". Controversy arose over some of the videos' violent content.<ref name="MTV news 2">{{cite news | first=Joe | last=D'Angelo | title=Sum 41 Video Skit Deemed Unsuitable For Children&nbsp;<U+2014> Band Says, 'Good!' | date=November 19, 2004 | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493978/11192004/sum_41.jhtml | publisher=[[Viacom]] | work=[[MTV.com]] | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> They made several other videos, including ''Basketball Butcher'' and ''1-800-Justice'', which were originally available exclusively on Sum 41's now-defunct fan club, ''The Goon Platoon''.

Sum 41's most recent internet video project is a "weekly series,"<ref>(The band originally stated it was a weekly series; but it was often months between the release of each video.)</ref> ''SUM 41 - Road to Ruin''. The trailer was posted on January 8, 2007 on the Sum 41 web page. The first episode debuted on January 21; it followed their exploits on their Singapore 2003 tour. Since then, their episodes have included footage of drunkenness in New Orleans, setting off a fire alarm in a hotel, and a feature about their first tour manager. So far, they have released ten episodes, with their latest and as they have stated recently, their 'last' for now being an episode that features their guitar technician. They also created a series of cartoons based on superhero "Stickman Moss" who saved the world from anti-punk figures who endangered the world of punk rock.

In December 2009, the band launched a new daily update series from the pre-production of their upcoming fifth studio album. It was announced on the band's [[Myspace]] page that the daily updates will run for the 2<U+2013>3 weeks of pre-production. 13 video updates from the pre-production were made and posted on the band's [[Myspace]] page.

===Side projects and collaborations===
Before the release of ''[[Half Hour of Power]]'' and up until the departure of Dave Baksh, Sum 41 occasionally played as an alter-ego 1980s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band called '''Pain for Pleasure''' during shows. The band appeared in Sum 41's music videos for "[[Fat Lip]]" and "[[We're All to Blame]]" and had at least one song on each of the band's first three releases.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bliss |first=Karen |title=Sum Cross T's With DVD |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5936134/sum_cross_ts_with_dvd/print |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 19, 2002 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> Their best known song under the '''Pain for Pleasure''' moniker is "Pain for Pleasure" from ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', a track that remains their staple during live shows.

Sum 41 has collaborated with many other artists, both live and in the studio, among whom are [[Tenacious D]],<ref>{{cite news |coauthors= | title=Sum 41/Tenacious D: "Things I Want" | date=2007-12-24 | publisher=punknews.org | url =http://www.punknews.org/article/27063 | accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref> [[Ludacris]],<ref name='Ludacris'>{{cite news | first=Rashaun | last=Hall | title=Luda, Sum 41 Get Down On 'Get Back' During 'SNL' Rehearsal | date=2005-01-20 | publisher=[[Viacom]] | work=[[MTV.com]] | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1496104/20050120/ludacris.jhtml| accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref> [[Iggy Pop]],<ref name='Iggy' /> [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[Unwritten Law]],<ref name='Law'>{{cite news | first=Gene | last=Stout | title=Hot punk band Sum 41 is planning cool antics | date=2002-01-25 | publisher=Seattlepi.com | url =http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/55728_sum25.shtml | accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref> [[Treble Charger]],<ref>{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn | title=Avril, Sum 41 Part Of Rear-End Mystery In Treble Charger Video | date=2003-02-07 | publisher=[[Viacom]] | work=[[MTV.com]] | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1469818/20030206/treble_charger.jhtml| accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref> [[Nelly]], [[Gob (band)|Gob]],<ref name='Law' /> [[Tommy Lee]],<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Lamb | title=Tommy Lee&nbsp;<U+2014> Tommyland, the Ride | date= | publisher=Top40.com | url =http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/tommyland.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-19 }}</ref> [[Rob Halford]], [[Metallica]],<ref>{{cite news | title=Sum 41 and The Donnas to Perform Friday Night At The Gravity Games | url =http://skateboard.about.com/od/events/a/GravityGsMusic.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-20}}</ref> and [[Ja Rule]].

Shortly after touring for ''Does This Look Infected?'', Sum 41 was recruited by [[Iggy Pop]] for his album, ''[[Skull Ring]]''.<ref name='Iggy' /> Deryck co-wrote the first single from the album, "[[Little Know It All]]", and joined Iggy on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to promote the song.<ref name='Iggy'>{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn | title=Iggy Pop, Sum 41 Think They 'Know It All' | date=2003-10-29 | publisher=[[Viacom]] | work=[[MTV.com]] | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480052/20031029/iggy_pop.jhtml | accessdate = 2008-10-19}}</ref> Following their September 11, 2005 show in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], the band went on a touring hiatus, although on April 17, 2006, Sum 41 played at a tribute to Iggy Pop, joining Iggy on stage for "Little Know It All" and "Lust For Life".

During the band's 2006 touring hiatus, Whibley focused on his producing career: he produced two songs for [[Avril Lavigne]]'s album ''[[The Best Damn Thing]]''. Jocz recorded his first video as director for a Canadian band, [[The Midway State]], and McCaslin started a side project with [[Todd Morse]] of [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and [[Juliette and the Licks]]. McCaslin's two-person band, named [[The Operation M.D.]], released their debut album, ''[[We Have an Emergency]]'', in early 2007. As well as playing bass, keyboards, and acoustic guitar, Cone contributed backing vocals as well as leading vocals on three songs. The album was co-produced and mixed by Whibley. Their video for their first single, "Sayonara", was directed by Jocz.

In December 2007, McCaslin interviewed [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] of [[Velvet Revolver]]. They talked about Slash's experiences while in [[Guns N' Roses]] and his part in Velvet Revolver. The interview was part of a [[MySpace]] project and was posted on the site in three parts.<ref>{{cite news | title=Cone & Slash | date=December 3, 2007 | url =http://theresnosolution.com/en/index.php?action=fullnews&showcomments=1&id=135 | work =Theresnosolution.com | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref>

The 2010 video game ''VANCOUVER 2010<U+2122> - THE OFFICIAL VIDEO GAME OF THE OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES'' features Sum 41's "Open Your Eyes" from Chuck as one of the game's songs.

==Music style and influences==

The genre of Sum 41's music has been disputed by fans because of the complex combination of different musical styles and the more mature, serious, and heavy sound in later albums.<ref>{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Heath | title=Sum 41 Chuck Album Review | url =http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/041028/33/1x9m2.html | publisher=Yahoo | date=2004-10-24| accessdate = 2009-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Johnny | last=Loftus | title=(((  Chuck > Review  ))) | url =http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=ADFEAEE47B16D84DAD7F20CE932C4BC7947EF71DDF40E8870A29491BDFBA3C54D95B79EF45FA8781B0FA6AB57AB0FD2EA45E43D1C0EF52F6D86F2D5DF0&sql=10:4ay67uq040jg~T1 | accessdate = 2009-01-11}}</ref> Fans and critics agree that ''Half Hour of Power'' and ''All Killer No Filler'' were mainly pop punk, punk rock and rapcore, but ''Does This Look Infected?'' and ''Chuck'' started moving toward heavier styles, such as alternative rock and alternative metal.<ref>{{cite news | first=Joe | last=D'Angelo | coauthors= | title=Sum 41: Testing Their Metal | date= | publisher=[[Viacom]] | work=[[MTV.com]] | url =http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/sum_41/news_feature_080202/index.jhtml | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-20 | language = }}</ref> Critics have described ''Underclass Hero'' as a revival of the band's old pop punk style.<ref>{{cite news | first=Vik | last=Bansal | title=Sum 41 Album reviews | url =http://www.musicomh.com/albums/sum-41.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}</ref> The genre argument is centralized around the punk streak of the band, and they have been labeled as [[pop punk]], [[punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]].<ref name="Allmusic overview">{{cite news | first=Johnny | last=Loftus | title=Allmusic: Sum 41 Overview | url =http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fzfuxqrkldhe | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Sum 41: Underclass Hero (2007) Review | url =http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/sum41/underclasshero | accessdate = 2008-08-17|work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Mikael | last=Wood | title=Underclass Hero: Music Review | date=July 20, 2007 | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20047311,00.html | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; "The Jester" is an "anti-Bush screed", "Underclass Hero" is a song about class struggle, and "Dear Father" is about Deryck's absent father.<ref>{{cite news | first=Christian | last=Hoard | title=Underclass Hero Review | date=2007-08-23 | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/sum41/albums/album/15502568/review/15807523/underclass_hero | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | publisher=Wenner Media | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}</ref>
