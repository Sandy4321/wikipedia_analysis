'''Robert Conti''' (born [[November 21]], [[1945]]) is an American [[hard bop]] [[jazz]] guitarist.

Robert Conti was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], first performing locally at age fourteen. In 1966, after four years on the road touring [[North America]], he settled in [[Jacksonville]], [[Florida]].  In 1970 he left music to pursue a career in the securities industry. In 1976 he began playing jazz again.  In 1979, he was signed to LA based [[Discovery Records label]].  Conti released ''Latin Love Affair'' and a Direct To Disc recording titled ''Solo Guitar'' as his debut efforts as a leader in 1979. In 1982 he left music again for the business world.  In 1985 he managed to released another album, and in 1986 he headlined the [[Florida National Jazz Festival]], with [[Jimmy McGriff]] and [[Nick Brignola]] as his sidemen.  In mid 1988 he was offered a position under filmmaker [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]].  After a lengthy recovery from a back injury in late '88, he was offered a position as resident jazz guitarist at the Irvine Marriott. He held that gig until mid 1998. Many of his most recent endeavors have been didactic in nature; since starting his website in 2000, he has released 27 educational DVDs on jazz guitar performance. On March 7, 2009, Robert Conti was a guest of the Las Vegas Guitar Club where he conducted a master class/clinic to a standing room only crowd at Sam Ash Music Store.
