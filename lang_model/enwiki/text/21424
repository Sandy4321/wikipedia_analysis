{{Medal of Honor recipients}}
This is a '''list of [[United States]] military personnel who received the [[Medal of Honor]] for their actions during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]'''. The battle took place in February and March 1945 during [[World War II]]. The [[United States|American]] invasion, known as [[Operation Detachment]], was charged with capturing the airfields on Iwo Jima.

The battle was marked by some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 kilometers (11 mi) of tunnels. The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese [[Home Islands]], and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, over 20,000 were killed and only 216 taken prisoner.

During the 2-month-long battle, 27 U.S. military personnel were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions. Of the 27 medals awarded, 23 were presented to [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and four were presented to [[United States Navy]] sailors; this is a full 30% of the 82 Medals of Honor awarded to Marines in the entirety of World War II.<ref name=MOHSTAT>{{cite web

==The Medal of Honor==
{{Main|Medal of Honor}}
The [[Medal of Honor]] is the highest military decoration awarded by the [[United States]] government, similar to the British [[Victoria Cross]] or the French [[Legion of Honor]]. It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself "<U+2026>conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States<U+2026>" Because of its nature, the medal is commonly awarded posthumously.
