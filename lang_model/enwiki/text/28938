'''SS ''Corvus''''' was a 1,317 [[Gross Register Tonnage|GRT]]<ref name=Lloyds>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=45a0262.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamer & Motorships|publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=24 February 2009}}</ref> [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[steamship]] built in [[Copenhagen]] in 1920/21 by Kj<U+00F8>benhavns Flydedok & Skibsv<U+00E6>rft A/S for the Norwegian passenger ship company [[Det Bergenske Dampskibsselskab]] of [[Bergen]], which was attacked and sunk by two German [[U-boat]]s in the [[Western Approaches]] of the [[English Channel]] on 27 February 1945. 

==World War II==
She spent the early part of 1940 plying between Norway and the [[United Kingdom]]. She joined [[List of World War II convoys#European Coastal Atlantic Convoys|Convoy HN 25]], which left [[Bergen]] on 7 April 1940, thus managing to get out of Norway just before the [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|German invasion]] which was initiated on 9 April. She spent the rest of 1940 in the coastal waters around the UK, with occasional passages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to Canada. In 1941 she made one voyage to [[West Africa]] visiting [[Lagos]] and [[Port Harcourt]] as well as crossing the Atlantic twice, visiting [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and [[New York City]]. During these voyages she carried various general cargoes, as well as [[Palm oil|palm kernel]]s from Nigeria and [[lumber]] from North America.<ref name="Warsailors"/>

During 1942 and early 1943 she sailed in the areas around the [[British Isles]], before a voyage to [[Gibraltar]] and [[North Africa]] as part of [[List of World War II convoys#Mediterranean and North African Coastal Convoys|Convoy KMS16]] commencing in June. She remained in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] until her return to [[Liverpool]] in February 1944. After spending four months undergoing repairs, she returned to service around the British Isles in July, continuing until her final voyage.<ref name="Warsailors"/>

===Final voyage===
On 23 February 1945, ''Corvus'' departed [[Garston, Merseyside|Garston]] near Liverpool bound for [[Plymouth]] with a cargo of 1,800 tons of coal, with Alexander Wallace as captain, carrying a crew of 22 plus a [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships|DEMS]] gun crew of three British [[Royal Navy]] gunners. She changed convoy at [[Mumbles]], and left [[Mumbles Head]] on the morning of 26 February to join [[List of World War II convoys#European Coastal Atlantic Convoys|Convoy BTC 81]] near Scarwater Lightship.<ref name="Warsailors"/>

At 10:15 BST on 27 February, the convoy was attacked by two German [[U-boat]]s, [[German submarine U-327|''U-327'']] and [[German submarine U-1018|''U-1018'']] about seven miles from [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] (at {{coord|49|55|N|05|22|W}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seawaves.com/newsletters/TDIH/february/27Feb.txt|title=SeaWaves Today in History February 27, 2009 |date=27 February 2008|accessdate=21 February 2009 |work= www.seawaves.com}}</ref> She was hit by a [[torpedo]] launched by ''U-1018'' which ripped her starboard side open, causing her to develop a heavy list and sink within minutes,<ref name="Warsailors"/> resulting in the death of four of the freighter's Norwegian crew, the [[Latvia]]n stoker,<ref name=warsailors>{{cite web|url=http://warsailors.com/singleships/corvus.html#survivors|title=DS Corvus - crew list|date=30 July 2008|accessdate=21 February 2009 |work=www.warsailors.com}}</ref> a 16-year old British cabin boy, Thomas Boniface,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2795564|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission: Casualty Details (T.A.

Some of the crew had been able to launch a raft, while others had to jump overboard. Most of the survivors were picked up by the British steam merchant ship ''Baronscourt'', one survivor by the Swedish steam ship ''Wallonia'' and landed in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] for medical treatment of four injured survivors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/3457.html|title=DS Corvus|date= |accessdate=22 February 2009 |work=www.uboat.net}}</ref>

The convoy escort ships immediately launched heavy counter-attacks. Less than two hours later, both ''U-1018'' and ''U-327'' were sunk by [[depth charge]]s dropped by [[HMS Loch Fada (K390)|HMS ''Loch Fada'']] under the command of Cdr. Benjamin Andrew Rogers, RD, [[Royal Navy Reserve|RNR]].
