:''Not to be confused with the'' [[F.3500 Sparviero]], ''a later, uncompleted twin engined aircraft from the same designer.''

The '''Pasotti F.9 Sparviero''' ({{lang-en|Sparrowhawk}}) was a four seat low wing touring aircraft, built in [[Italy]] in the 1950s.  Designed by [[Stelio Frati]], it was a single engine version of his earlier twin engined [[Pasotti F.6 Airone|Airone]].  Only one was built.

==Design and development==

The F.9 Sparviero was a single engined version of the earlier, twin engined F.6 Airone, both Stelio Frati designs.  The two aircraft shared many constructional details and had almost the same dimensions and weights, though the Sparviero's nose mounted engine extended the [[fuselage]].  Engine layout apart, the two were very similar in appearance; they also both failed to reach production and only one Airone and one Sparviero were built.<ref name=JAWA57/><ref name=Flight/>

The Sparviero had an all wood, [[Monoplane#Types of monoplane|low mounted]] [[cantilever]] wing of [[trapezoid#Special cases|isosceles trapezoidal]] plan, built around a single [[spar (aviation)|spar]] and covered with stressed [[plywood]] skin, with [[ailerons#Differential ailerons|differential ailerons]] and [[trailing edge]] [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]].  The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden [[monocoque]], built in two sections which bolted together just aft of the wings.  The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage.<ref name=JAWA57/>  The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250&nbsp;hp (187&nbsp;kW) [[Hirth]] inverted [[V8 engine|V-8]] air-cooled engine, though it was the intention to replace this with a 260&nbsp;hp (194&nbsp;kW) [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming horizontally opposed engine]] in production models<ref name=JAWA57/> and the prototype received one later.<ref name=web1/>  Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings and one in the fuselage.  The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage.  The latter tapered in height rearwards and the [[fin]] merged into it with a [[dorsal]] [[fillet]].  The [[empennage]] construction was similar to that of the wing, except that the control surfaces were [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covered]]. The [[tricycle undercarriage]] was retractable and fitted with [[hydraulic brake]]s.<ref name=JAWA57/>

The Sparviero first flew on 27 July 1956,<ref name=web2/> piloted by Vico Rocaspina who was responsible for all the early flight programme.<ref name=Flight/>

==Operational history==

The only Sparviero built, ''I-HAWK'', was in private hands by April 1958,<ref name=AB1/> based at [[Linate Airport|Milano Linate]] and was still there in July 1964.<ref name=AB2/> The heading image shows it in good condition at Linate in July 1965.
