'''No. 5 Operational Training Unit''' (OTU) was an [[operational conversion unit]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. It was formed at [[RAAF Base Wagga|Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales, in October 1942 to train light bomber pilots and navigators for service in World War&nbsp;II. The unit was initially equipped with [[Bristol Beaufort]]s and [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]]s, and later acquired [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]] and [[de&nbsp;Havilland Mosquito]]s, among other types. It was transferred to [[RAAF Station Tocumwal|Tocumwal]] in October 1943, and then to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|Williamtown]] in mid-1944. Disbanded in July 1947, No.&nbsp;5 OTU was briefly re-raised in April 1970 as a jet fighter conversion unit, operating [[CAC&nbsp;Sabre]]s, [[de&nbsp;Havilland Vampire]]s, and [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326]]s. It ceased operations in July the following year.

==History==

===World War II===
During World War&nbsp;II, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) established several [[Operational conversion unit|operational training units]] (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills they had already learned.<ref name=Stephens>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 167<U+2013>168, 364</ref> No.&nbsp;5 Operational Training Unit was formed at [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Station Forest Hill]] in [[Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales, on 26&nbsp;October 1942. Initially equipped with five [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and two [[Bristol Beaufort]]s, its inaugural commanding officer was [[Squadron Leader]] B.F. Rose. The first training course ran from 2&nbsp;November to 12&nbsp;December 1942. At the end of the month the unit's strength was 170 personnel and sixteen aircraft.<ref name=Units>RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref> By mid-1943 this had increased to almost 400 personnel and twenty-five aircraft, including four [[de Havilland Dragon|de&nbsp;Havilland DH-84]]s and one [[de&nbsp;Havilland Moth Minor]], the remaining twenty being Beauforts and Beaufighters. The unit's aircraft complement was augmented by its first [[Airspeed Oxford]] in August 1943.<ref name=Units/>

By the time No.&nbsp;5 OTU relocated to [[RAAF Station Tocumwal]], New South Wales, on 20&nbsp;October 1943, it had begun running courses on [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]]s. Its first [[de Havilland Mosquito]] arrived the following month. As of April 1944, the unit had a complement of sixty-three aircraft, including five Mosquitos. It ran conversion courses for experienced pilots and navigators, as well as training courses for newer aircrew.<ref name=Units/> [[No. 4 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;4 Operational Training Unit]] disbanded at [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]], New South Wales, on 30&nbsp;April 1944; a small detachment remained to hand the base over to an advance party from No.&nbsp;5 OTU the following day.<ref>RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', p. 70</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/Raaf/organisation/info_on/bases/williamtown/history2.htm|accessdate=28 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708234818/http://www.defence.gov.au/Raaf/organisation/info_on/bases/williamtown/history2.htm |archivedate=8 July 2007|title=Williamtown units during WWII|publisher=[[Royal Australian Air Force]]}}</ref> The rest of No.&nbsp;5 OTU transferred to Williamtown during July.

===Re-establishment===

No. 5 OTU was re-formed at RAAF Base Williamtown on 1&nbsp;April 1970 to provide pilots with operational training prior to their conversion to the [[Dassault Mirage&nbsp;III]] fighter. The unit's reactivation was celebrated with a dinner attended by its original commanding officer, B.F. Rose, and a flypast of forty-nine aircraft from [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Operational Conversion Unit]] (OCU).<ref name=Units/> No.&nbsp;5 OTU was divided into instructional and operational [[Flight (military unit)|flights]], and conducted training in concert with Mirages from No.&nbsp;2 OCU and [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;76 Squadron]].<ref name=Units/> Its aircraft also participated in joint exercises and display flights, including air shows celebrating the RAAF's 1971 [[golden jubilee]].<ref name=Units/><ref>{{cite journal|title=The 'Sword' retires from service|work=RAAF News, Vol. 13, No. 7|date=August 1971|page= p. 3}}</ref> The unit was equipped with forty [[CAC Sabre]] jet fighters, some [[de Havilland Vampire]] jet trainers, and eight [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326]]s previously operated by No.&nbsp;2 OCU for lead-in fighter training.<ref name=Units/><ref name=Units2OCU>RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 62<U+2013>64</ref> Vampire operations began winding down in September 1970, and the type was withdrawn in April 1971.<ref name=Units/>

The last Sabre conversion course was completed in December 1970.<ref name=RAAFApr71>{{cite journal|title=Sabres to retire|work=RAAF News Vol. 13, No. 3|date=April 1971|page= p. 8}}</ref> Early the following year, the Australian government announced that the Sabres were to be phased out and retired by July 1971. At this time RAAF fighter pilots were trained progressively on the [[CAC Winjeel|Winjeel]], Macchi, Sabre and Mirage, but after considering the feasibility of direct Macchi-to-Mirage conversion, and the impracticability of maintaining the ageing Sabres, the government determined that it was possible to remove the Sabre from the process and retire the type, on the proviso that more Mirage trainers were made available; it subsequently approved the purchase of six new Mirage IIID dual trainers to augment the ten already in service.<ref name=RAAFApr71/><ref>{{cite journal|title=More Mirage dual trainers|journal=RAAF News, Vol. 13, No. 1|date=January/February 1971|page= p. 3}}</ref> No.&nbsp;5 OTU was disbanded on 31&nbsp;July 1971, the date the Sabre was retired from RAAF service.<ref name=Units/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A94.htm|title=CAC Sabre|publisher=[[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> The unit's Macchis were transferred back to No.&nbsp;2 OCU.<ref name=Units2OCU/>

Following No.&nbsp;5 OTU's disbandment, one of its Sabres, A94-983, was among several donated by the Australian government to the [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]].<ref name=Media>{{cite media release|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/2005/051125.doc|title=Chief of Air Force to sign historical aircraft agreement|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|date=25 November 2005|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 266</ref> The aircraft was returned to the RAAF in 1978, and subsequently put on display at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Bases Richmond]], New South Wales, and [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], Victoria.
