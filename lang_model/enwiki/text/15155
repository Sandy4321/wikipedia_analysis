'''Pulaski''' is an elevated [[metro station|station]] on the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago 'L'|'L' system]]. Pulaski serves the [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange Line]], which runs between [[Midway Airport]] and [[The Loop (CTA)|The Loop]]; it is situated between [[Midway (CTA)|Midway]] and [[Kedzie (CTA Orange Line)|Kedzie]] stations.  Pulaski is located at [[Pulaski Road (Chicago)|Pulaski Road]] and 51st Street on the [[South Side (Chicago)|Southwest Side]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The station is within the [[Archer Heights, Chicago|Archer Heights]] neighborhood, which is both residential and commercial, and the station itself is in a commercial district on Pulaski Road. Pulaski opened on October 31, 1993, the opening date of the Orange Line.

The Pulaski station was proposed in 1980 and constructed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When the station opened in 1993, it spurred commercial development in the surrounding area and led to a parking controversy on nearby residential streets. Pulaski consists of an elevated [[island platform]] above a station house which is set back from Pulaski Road. The station also includes a bus terminal and a [[park and ride]] lot. Nearly 1.4 million passengers boarded Orange Line trains at Pulaski in 2010. Trains serve Pulaski approximately every ten minutes during rush hour but are less frequent at other times. In addition to offering train service, Pulaski also connects to several [[List of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes|CTA bus routes]].

== History ==
The Orange Line, including the Pulaski station, was first proposed in 1980 by Chicago Mayor [[Jane Byrne]], who planned to fund the line using money from the cancelled [[Crosstown Expressway (Chicago)|Crosstown Expressway]] project. U.S. Representative [[William Lipinski]] secured necessary federal funding for the line in 1986 as a political favor from President [[Ronald Reagan]], and Chicago Mayor [[Harold Washington]] signed a federal funding contract the next year.<ref name="washburn">{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Washburn |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Midway 'L' Finally Ready to Roll - 13 Years Later, CTA Set to Open Southwest Side Line |url= |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher= |date=October 31, 1993 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> Construction began on the line in 1988 and was completed in 1993; the total cost of the line was $510 million.<ref name="borcover">{{cite news |first=Alfred |last=Borcover |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Quickening the Pace - Rapid Transit Line Spurs Interest in Development, Housing on Southwest Side |url= |work=Chicago Tribune |publisher= |date=October 10, 1993 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> The Pulaski station was built over an abandoned [[Belt Railway of Chicago]] line which ran from 49th Street to Midway Airport.<ref name="chicagol2">{{cite web |last=Garfield |first=Graham | title=Orange Line: Midway | url=http://www.chicago-l.org/operations/lines/midway.html | work=Chicago-l.org | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> Pulaski, along with the rest of the Orange Line, opened on October 31, 1993. The CTA only charged riders 25 cents during Pulaski's first three days, which were considered a test run of the line.<ref name="washburn"/>

The Pulaski station spurred commercial development in the [[Archer Heights, Chicago|Archer Heights]] neighborhood. Area development began even before the station opened, as the Midway Square shopping mall opened at Pulaski Road and 51st Street in 1988 in anticipation of the potential customers the Orange Line would bring.<ref name="borcover"/> The station's opening continued the trend of development, and Pulaski station was credited with boosting business in Archer Heights and doubling property values in the neighborhood.<ref name="kerrill">{{cite news |first=Tamara |last=Kerrill |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Southwest Side Rides Orange Line to Boom Times |url= |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher= |date=July 31, 1995 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> The station also created a parking problem in the neighborhood. The station's parking lot filled up as early as 7 A.M. most workdays, causing commuters to park on residential streets. The commuters prompted local residents to ban non-residents from parking on certain streets during daytime hours.<ref name="kerrill2">{{cite news |first=Tamara |last=Kerrill |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=When Orange Line Riders Park, Residents See Red |url= |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher= |date=April 28, 1994 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

The Pulaski station was designed by the City of Chicago. The station house is at ground level and is set back from the street.
