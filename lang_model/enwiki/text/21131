== History ==
=== Early influences ===
An important early influence on anarchist naturism was the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]],<ref name="acracia.org"/> [[Leo Tolstoy]]<ref name="naturismolibertario"/> and [[Elisee Reclus]].<ref name="Reclus1">[http://www.natustar.com/uk/naturism-begin.html "The pioneers"]</ref> 
[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|180px|thumb|left|''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Influential early [[eco-anarchist]] work]] Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[naturist]] currents,<ref name="acracia.org"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name="acracia.org"/> and [[self-sufficiency]] were Thoreau's goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. "Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]] this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century."<ref name="naturismo"/> [[John Zerzan]] himself included the text "Excursions" (1863) by Thoreau in his edited compilation of anti-civilization writings called ''Against civilization: Readings and reflections'' from 1999.<ref>[http://www.amazon.fr/dp/toc/0922915989 'Against civilization: Readings and reflections' by [[John Zerzan&#93; (editor)&#93;]]</ref>

=== France ===
For the influential French anarchist [[<U+00C9>lis<U+00E9>e Reclus]] naturism "was at the same time a physical means of revitalization, a report with the body completely different from hypocrisy and taboos which prevailed at the time, a more convivial way to see life in society, and an incentive to a respect of the planet. Thus naturism develops in France, in particular under the influence of Elized Reclus, end XIX century and beginning XX century, among anarchistic communities resulting from [[utopian socialism]]."<ref name="Reclus1"/>

In [[Anarchism in France|France]] later important propagandists of anarcho-naturism [[Henri Zisly]]<ref name="revolutionprotestencyclopedia.com">[http://www.revolutionprotestencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?query=henry+david+thoreau&widen=1&result_number=1&from=search&id=g9781405184649_yr2011_chunk_g97814051846491756&type=std&fuzzy=0&slop=1 "Zisly, Henri (1872<U+2013>1945)" by Stefano Boni]</ref> and [[Emile Gravelle]] who collaborated in ''La Nouvelle Humanit<U+00E9>'' followed by ''Le Naturien'', ''Le Sauvage'', ''L'Ordre Naturel'', & ''La Vie Naturelle'' <ref name="naturismo2">[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/1121.htm The daily bleed]</ref> Their ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in France but also in Spain where [[Federico Urales]] ([[pseudonym]] of Joan Montseny), promotes the ideas of Gravelle and Zisly in ''[[La Revista Blanca]]'' (1898<U+2013>1905).<ref name="naturismo1">[http://www.nodo50.org/lagarbancitaecologica/garbancita/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150:los-origenes-del-naturismo-libertario&catid=61:investigacion-formacion-debate&Itemid=77 "Los origenes del naturismo libertario" por Agust<U+00ED>n Mor<U+00E1>n]</ref> Zisly aimed "at supporting a return to <U+201C>natural life<U+201D> through writing and practical involvement, stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment. Zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization, which he regarded as <U+201C>absurd, ignoble, and filthy.<U+201D> He openly opposed industrialization, arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian, defended nudism, advocated a non-dogmatic and non-religious adherence to the <U+201C>laws of nature,<U+201D> recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self-sufficiency, and disagreed with vegetarianism, which he considered <U+201C>anti-scientific.<U+201D>"<ref name="revolutionprotestencyclopedia.com"/>

The influence of naturist views in the wider french anarchist movement could be seen in this way. "In her memoir of her anarchist years that was serialized in ''Le Matin'' in 1913, [[Rirette Maitrejean|Rirette Ma<U+00EE>trejean]] made much of the strange food regimens of some of the compagnons...She described the <U+201C>tragic bandits<U+201D> of the [[Bonnot gang]] as refusing to eat meat or drink wine, preferring plain water. Her humorous comments reflected the practices of the <U+201C>naturist<U+201D> wing of individualist anarchists who favored a simpler, more <U+201C>natural<U+201D> lifestyle centered on a vegetarian diet. In the 1920s, this wing was expressed by the journal ''Le N<U+00E9>o-Naturien, Revue des Id<U+00E9>es Philosophiques et Naturiennes''. Contributors condemned the fashion of smoking cigarettes, especially by young women; a long article of 1927 actually connected cigarette smoking with cancer! Others distinguished between vegetarians, who foreswore the eating of meat, from the stricter <U+201C>vegetalians,<U+201D> who ate nothing but vegetables. An anarchist named G. Butaud, who made this distinction, opened a restaurant called the Foyer V<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>talien in the nineteenth arrondissement in 1923. Other issues of the journal included vegetarian recipes. In 1925, when the young anarchist and future detective novelist L<U+00E9>o Malet arrived in Paris from Montpellier, he initially lodged with anarchists who operated another vegetarian restaurant that served only vegetables, with neither fish nor eggs. Nutritional concerns coincided with other means of encouraging health bodies, such as nudism and gymnastics. For a while in the 1920s, after they were released from jail for antiwar and birth-control activities, Jeanne and Eug<U+00E8>ne Humbert retreated to the relative safety of the <U+201C>integral living<U+201D> movement that promoted nude sunbathing and physical fitness, which were seen as integral aspects of health in the Greek sense of ''[[gymnos]]'', meaning nude. This back-to-nature, primitivist current was not a monopoly of the left; the same interests were echoed by right-wing Germans in the interwar era. In France, however, these proclivities were mostly associated with anarchists, insofar as they suggested an ideal of self-control and the rejection of social [[taboo]]s and prejudices."<ref>[http://www.psupress.org/justataste/samplechapters/justatasteSonn.html "Sex, Violence, and the Avant-Garde" by Richard D.

=== Spain ===
This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]].<ref name="naturismo.org">[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html "Anarchism - Nudism, Naturism" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid. Published on Revista ''ADN''. Winter 2003]</ref> "The linking role played by the <U+2018>Sol y Vida<U+2019> group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, <U+2018>Ecl<U+00E9>ctico<U+2019>, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the [[Spanish Civil War]]. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ''[[Iniciales]]''. He writes it under the odd pseudonym of <U+2018>silvestre del campo<U+2019>, (wild man in the country). <U+201C>I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.<U+201D>"<ref name="naturismo.org"/>
 
An influential spanish anarchist during the 1920s and 1930s who was also an important propagandist of anarcho-naturism was [[Isaac Puente]].<ref name="cgt.es">[http://www.cgt.es/telecomunicaciones/ateneo/isaac_puente_comunismo_libertario.pdf Isaac Puente. ''El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y naturistas.'']</ref><ref>[http://acciocultural.org/index.php?main_page=product_book_info&products_id=2243 Miguel I<U+00F1>iguez.

Asociaci<U+00F3>n Isaac Puente.]</ref> Puente was a militant of both the [[Confederaci<U+00F3>n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union and [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]];  and wrote the final document for the Extraordinary Confederal Congress of Zaragoza of 1936 which established the main political line for the CNT for that year.<ref>"De hecho, el documento de Isaac Puente se convirti<U+00F3> en dictamen oficial aprobado en el Congreso Extraordinario Confederal de Zaragoza de 1936 que serv<U+00ED>a de base para fijar la l<U+00ED>nea pol<U+00ED>tica de la CNT respecto a la organizaci<U+00F3>n social y pol<U+00ED>tica futura.

''El anarquismo individualista en Espa<U+00F1>a (1923-1938)''. Virus editorial. 2007]</ref> In 1933 he published the book ''El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y naturistas.'' (en:''Libertarian Communism and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims'') which sold around 100.000 copies.<ref>[http://www.cgt.es/telecomunicaciones/ateneo/isaac_puente_comunismo_libertario.pdf Isaac Puente. ''El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y naturistas.'' pg. 4]</ref> Isaac Puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view.<ref name="cgt.es"/> He approached naturism as an integral solution for the working classes alongside [[Neo-Malthusianism|neomalthusianism]]. He saw that naturism seeked to approach the living being while anarchism seeked to address the social being.<ref>"Y complementarlos puesto que se ocupan de aspectos distintos, <U+2013>el uno redime al ser vivo, el otro al ser social"[http://www.cgt.es/telecomunicaciones/ateneo/isaac_puente_comunismo_libertario.pdf Isaac Puente. ''El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y naturistas.'']</ref> He saw that capitalist societies endangered the well being of humans from both a socio-economic point of view as well as a sanitary one and promoted [[anarcho-communism]] alongside naturism as a solution.<ref name="cgt.es"/>

This ecological tendency in spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the [[Confederaci<U+00F3>n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]&ndash;[[Federaci<U+00F3>n Anarquista Ib<U+00E9>rica|FAI]] in Spain. So [[Daniel Gu<U+00E9>rin]] in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' reports how "Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called "[[affinity group]]s." There were many adepts of naturism and [[vegetarianism]] among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a libertarian society. At the Saragossa congress the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, "unsuited to industrialization." As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings."<ref>http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html ''Anarchism: From theory to practice'' by [[Daniel Gu<U+00E9>rin]]</ref>

=== Cuba ===
The historian Kirwin R. Schaffer in his study of [[cuban anarchism]] reports anarcho-naturism as "A third strand within the island<U+2019>s anarchist movement" alongside [[anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].<ref name="raforum.info"/> Naturism was a global alternative health and lifestyle movement. Naturists focused on redefining one<U+2019>s life to live simply, eat cheap but nutritious vegetarian diets, and raise one<U+2019>s own food if possible. The countryside was posited as a romantic alternative to urban living, and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the healthful benefits of nudism. Globally, the naturist movement counted anarchists, liberals, and socialists as its followers. However, in Cuba a particular <U+201C>anarchist<U+201D> dimension evolved led by people like Adri<U+00E1>n del Valle, who spearheaded the Cuban effort to shift naturism<U+2019>s focus away from only individual health to naturism having a <U+201C>social emancipatory<U+201D> function."<ref name="raforum.info"/> 

Schaffer reports the influence that anarcho-naturism had outside naturists circles. So "For instance, nothing inherently prevented an anarcho-syndicalist in the Havana restaurant workers<U+2019> union from supporting the alternative health care programs of the anarcho-naturists and seeing those alternative practices as <U+201C>revolutionary.<U+201D>".<ref name="raforum.info"/> "Anarcho-naturists promoted a rural ideal, simple living, and being in harmony with Nature as ways to save the laborers from the increasingly industrialized character of Cuba. Besides promoting an early twentieth-century <U+201C>[[back-to-the-land]]<U+201D> movement, they used these romantic images of Nature to illustrate how far removed a capitalist industrialized Cuba had departed from an anarchist view of natural harmony."<ref name="raforum.info"/> The main propagandizer in Cuba of anarcho-naturism was the [[Catalonia]] born "Adri<U+00E1>n del Valle (aka Palmiro de Lidia)...Over the following decades, Del Valle became a constant presence in not only the anarchist press that proliferated in Cuba but also mainstream literary publications...From 1912 to 1913 he edited the [[Freethought|freethinking]] journal ''El Audaz''. Then he began his largest publishing job by helping to found and edit the monthly alternative health magazine that followed the anarcho-naturist line ''Pro-Vida''.<ref name="raforum.info"/>

=== Other countries ===
Naturism also met [[anarchism in the United Kingdom]]. "In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900's nudism, anarchism, vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life. In the 1920's the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity."<ref>[http://www.radical.org.uk/nudism/radical.htm "Nudism the radical tradition" by Terry Phillips]</ref> In Italy, during the IX Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] in [[Carrara]] in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the ''Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica''. In the seventies, it was mostly composed of "veteran individualist anarchists with an [[anarcho-pacifism|pacifism]] orientation, naturism, etc,...".<ref name="almeralia.com"/>

== Criticisms ==
American anarcho-syndicalist [[Sam Dolgoff]] shows some of the criticism that some people on the other anarchist currents had for anarcho-naturist tendencies. "Speaking of life at the Stelton Colony of New York in the 1930s, noted with disdain that it, <U+201C>like other colonies, was infested by vegetarians, naturists, nudists, and other cultists, who sidetracked true anarchist goals.<U+201D> One resident <U+201C>always went barefoot, ate raw food, mostly nuts and raisins, and refused to use a tractor, being opposed to machinery, and he didn't want to abuse horses, so he dug the earth himself.<U+201D> Such self-proclaimed anarchists were in reality <U+201C>ox-cart anarchists,<U+201D> Dolgoff said, <U+201C>who opposed organization and wanted to return to a simpler life.<U+201D> In an interview with Paul Avrich before his death, Dolgoff also grumbled, <U+201C>I am sick and tired of these half-assed artists and poets who object to organization and want only to play with their belly buttons.<U+201D>".<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Brian_Oliver_Sheppard__Anarchism_vs._Primitivism.html Brian Oliver Sheppard.
