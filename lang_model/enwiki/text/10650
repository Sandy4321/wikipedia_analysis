'''Norman Allen Van Lier III''' (April 1, 1947 <U+2013> February 26, 2009) was an [[NBA]] [[basketball]] player and television broadcaster who spent the majority of his career with the [[Chicago Bulls]].

==Biography==
Norman Van Lier was born in [[East Liverpool, Ohio]] to Helen and Norm Sr., who worked in a steel mill for 31 years. He was raised, along with three brothers and a sister, in [[Midland, Pennsylvania]]. Van Lier had three other brothers who died after birth; he named one of them Elgin Baylor Van Lier I. Van Lier would look back fondly to his childhood playing tackle football with a taped coffee can for a ball due to their circumstances. He would later credit this upbringing in forming his famed work ethic later in life.<ref name=ChicagoReader>Ben Joravsky. "[http://www.chicagoreader.com/norm_van_lier/ Back in the Game]". ''Chicago Reader''. July 21, 1994. Retrieved on March 4, 2009</ref>

Van Lier was a member of the 1965 Midland High School Leopards, considered by many to be one of the greatest high school basketball teams of all time{{citation needed|date = March 2010}}, finishing 28-0 and easily winning the Pennsylvania State Championship. One of Van Lier's teammates was future NBA player [[Simmie Hill]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06239/716766-49.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=WPIAL 100 years: These are the athletes who have helped define it | first=Mike | last=White | date=August 27, 2006}}</ref> During weekends, Van Lier would hitchhike to the playgrounds in Harlem, once even playing with [[Billy Cunningham]].<ref name="ChicagoReader"/>

Van Lier was also a co-captain of his football team, where he played both [[quarterback]] and [[safety (American football position)|safety]]. He was recruited to play for several colleges, but none allowed him to play his desired position of quarterback. Van Lier had received offers to play professional baseball as well, after starring on his high school and county all-star teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

On June 21, 2008, he was inducted into the [[WPIAL]] Hall of Fame. <U+201C>Western Pennsylvania is football country, but my years are considered the golden era of basketball not only in the state but maybe the country,<U+201D> Van Lier said that night. <U+201C>Uniontown, Midland, Schenley and Ambridge could play with anybody, anytime and in any era in the country.<U+201D><ref name=WPIAL>Jim Frasier.

''New Pittsburgh Courier''. July 3, 2008. Retrieved on February 27, 2009.</ref>

===College and NBA career===
Van Lier's modest 6'1" stature and his emphasis on defense kept him under the radar of stardom, and he was not recruited by major basketball powers. He attended [[Saint Francis University]] of Pennsylvania, where he eventually emerged as a standout point guard. He graduated from [[Saint Francis University]] in 1969.<ref>2005 Saint Francis University Alumni Directory p. 319.</ref>

The [[Chicago Bulls]] selected Van Lier in the third round of the 1969 [[NBA Draft]], but immediately traded him to the [[Sacramento Kings|Cincinnati Royals]], with whom he led the NBA in assists in 1971. The Bulls then reacquired Van Lier during the [[1971<U+2013>72 NBA season|1971<U+2013>72 season]], and he remained with the Bulls until 1978, appearing in three [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] games ([[1974 NBA All-Star Game|1974]], [[1976 NBA All-Star Game|1976]], [[1977 NBA All-Star Game|1977]]) over the course of six seasons.  

Nicknamed "Stormin' Norman" for his tenacity and aggression, Van Lier was one of the most popular Bulls players of the 1970s{{citation needed|date = March 2010}}. During his ten year career, Van Lier was named to three NBA All-Defense First Teams and five NBA All-Defense Second Teams.  He was named to the All-NBA Second Team in 1974.  Van Lier was waived by the Bulls in October 1978.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/alltime_transactions.html]</ref> After playing briefly with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], he retired in 1979 with career totals of 8,770 points and 5,217 assists.

Van Lier held the record for the longest field goal in NBA history (84&nbsp;feet) for 24 years until [[Baron Davis]] broke the record on November 17, 2001 (89&nbsp;feet).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Post-NBA career===
Van Lier served as a [[color analyst]] on Bulls radio broadcasts from 1980-82. In 1989 he was the assistant coach of the [[Worcester Counts]] in the [[World Basketball League]]. From 1992 to 2009, he was a television pre-game and post-game analyst for Chicago Bulls games. He frequently appeared on other Chicago television programs to discuss the Bulls, and at one point co-hosted a sports talk radio show.<ref name=WPIAL/>

Van Lier was the head basketball coach for the Worcester Vocational Technical High School team during part of the 1989-1990 season. His team reached the Massachusetts Division II championship game.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-07/sports/9201210856_1_norm-van-lier-new-location-move/2 Van Lier Goes Back To Basics]</ref>  

Van Lier also served as a special [[disc jockey]] on the Chicago [[rock music]] station 97.9 [[WLUP-FM|WLUP]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Feder |coauthors=|title=Familiar voice helps WXRT cut to the Chase |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=73 |date=June 10, 2005 |accessdate=26 February 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref> In 2002 and 2004, he had supporting roles in the movies ''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'' and ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]''.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1235533/</ref>

On February 25, 2009, Van Lier was unexpectedly absent from his scheduled television appearance on [[Comcast SportsNet]] following a Bulls game. On February 26, 2009 he was found unresponsive in his apartment on Chicago's Near West Side.<ref>http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/02/former-bulls-star-norm-van-lier-dead-at-67.html</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/02/26/normvanlier.20090226.ap/index.html Former Bulls player, broadcaster Van Lier dead at 61]</ref> Fellow Bulls broadcaster and former Bulls head coach [[Johnny Kerr|Johnny "Red" Kerr]] also died later that day.
