'''Interstate 405''' (abbreviated '''I-405''', and [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] referred to as '''The 405''' or ''the four-oh-five''), is one of the principal north-south [[interstate highway]]s in [[Southern California]], and the major [[bypass (road)|bypass]] of [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] running through the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]. The entire 405 is the northern segment of the "[[San Diego Freeway]]" despite running no less than 75 [[mile]]s from downtown [[San Diego]]. I-405 is a heavily traveled thoroughfare by commuters and freight haulers along its entire length and has earned its place as one of the busiest and most congested [[freeway]]s in the world, and the most congested in the United States. <ref>http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/teachers/wr/article/0,27972,1099514,00.html</ref> <ref> [http://corsair.smc.edu/PDF/Corsair%202007-03-07%20web.pdf Santa Monica College Corsair News Article] </ref> It has played a crucial role in the development of dozens of cities and [[suburb]]s along its route through the [[Greater Los Angeles area]].

==Route description==
The 405 begins at the [[El Toro Y]] interchange with Interstate 5 in southeastern [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. It then runs northwest through [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] to [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. The freeway then roughly follows the outline of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast varying between five and ten miles inland before crossing over the [[Sepulveda Pass]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]]. I-405 then travels due north through the [[San Fernando Valley]] before terminating with I-5 in the [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California|Mission Hills]] district of Los Angeles.

The San Diego Freeway's congestion problems are legendary, leading to the joke that the Interstate was named 405 because traffic moves at "four or five" miles an hour. Indeed, average speeds as low as five miles per hour are routinely recorded during morning and afternoon commutes, and its interchanges with the [[Ventura Freeway]] ([[U.S. Route 101]]) and with the [[Santa Monica Freeway]] ([[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]]) each consistently rank among the five most congested freeway interchanges in the United States.

Commuters are known to despise the freeway. Steve Harvey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' once featured a [[US and Canadian license plates#Vanity and specialty plates|personalized license plate]] with the text HATE405 in his column. While much of this gridlock has to do with the lack of alternate routes between many of the areas it connects &mdash; some of which, such as the [[Pacific Coast Highway|Pacific Coast]] and [[Laurel Canyon Freeway|Laurel Canyon]] freeways, were proposed but abandoned for political reasons {{Fact|date=September 2007}}&mdash; the freeway would likely be busy even with the addition of other roads and [[mass transit]] solutions, as it connects so many important [[Greater Los Angeles area]] locations.

===Points of interest along the 405===

There are a number of points of interest that 405 passes by or connects to.  For transportation, these include, in the order passed in the direction from south to north, are [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Long Beach Municipal Airport]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport]].  With connections, it reaches very close to the [[Port of Long Beach]] and the [[Port of Los Angeles]].  

For commerce and recreation, it passes more than ten California state beaches, as well as many owned by counties and municipalities, and many tourist-heavy beach cities, as well as [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City]] a high-rise office park and [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]].

Some of the educational institutions it passes near to include the [[California State University|California State Universities]] at [[California State University, Dominguez Hills|Dominguez Hills]], [[California State University, Long Beach|Long Beach]], and [[California State University, Northridge|Northridge]]; the [[University of California]] at [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and [[Loyola Marymount University]].  Some cultural facilites it is near include [[Getty Center|The J. Paul Getty Center]] and the [[Skirball Cultural Center]].

===Legal Definition===

==History==
Interstate 405 was approved as a chargeable interstate in 1955. It begun construction in 1957 and the first section was opened in 1961 signed as SR-7 which is mostly, north of [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX Airport]]. I-405 sections west of [[Interstate 605]] ([[Los Alamitos Curve Interchange|Los Alamitos Curve]]) were done before 1965, and the newest section was done in 1969, covering most of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].  The freeway from present-day [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]] to [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] near [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] was once known as the '''Sepulveda Freeway''' as it was named for the L.A. district now known as [[North Hills, Los Angeles, California|North Hills]].<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/2006_Named_Freeways.pdf | title=2006 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California | publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] | pages=155 | accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref>

===The O.J. Simpson chase===

While dangerous high-speed chases along the San Diego Freeway are not uncommon, perhaps the most famous chase in its history was also one of the slowest. On the afternoon of [[June 17]], [[1994]], former [[American football|football]] star [[O.J. Simpson]], suspected in the murder of his ex-wife [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and waiter [[Ronald Goldman]], took to the freeway in a white [[Ford Bronco]] (driven by former [[University of Southern California|USC]] teammate [[Al Cowlings]]) with police in pursuit.  A bizarre, widely-televised low-speed chase ensued and ended hours later when Simpson returned to his [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] estate via the [[Sunset Boulevard]] exit and surrendered to law enforcement.

===Other events===
Following the 1966 [[UCLA-USC rivalry]] game, USC was voted into the Rose Bowl despite UCLA defeating the Trojans and both teams having only one loss. UCLA students protested by blocking the Northbound 405 lanes at Wilshire Boulevard.

[[Ennis Cosby]], the only son of [[Bill Cosby]], was murdered along I-405 in Los Angeles on [[January 16]], [[1997]], while fixing a flat tire.

In November 2003, [[Amber Stachowski]], a collegiate [[water polo]] player for the [[UCLA Bruins]] and member of the U.S. National Team was injured in a motor vehicle accident on Interstate 405. She sustained a concussion, which kept her out of the water for two months. Six months later, she qualified for the Olympic team, which won a [[bronze medal]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]]. <ref>[http://www.usoc.org/11631_18908.htm USOC News: Amber battles back after car accident]</ref>
