'''Comito''' ({{lang-el|{{Polytonic|<U+039A><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+1F7C>}}}}) was the daughter of [[Acacius]] "the bear-keeper", an elder sister to [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]] and Anastasia. Through Theodora, Comito was a sister-in-law of [[Justinian I]]. The Secret History of [[Procopius]] is a main source about her. Comito is also mentioned by [[John Malalas]], [[Theophanes the Confessor]] and [[Georgios Kedrenos]]<ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 329</ref> 

==Background==

Her father, Acacius, was a bear trainer of the [[hippodrome|hippodrome's]] Green faction in [[Constantinople]]. Her mother, whose name is not recorded, was a dancer and an actress.<ref> The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire 2 Volume Set., J. R. Martindale, 1992 Cambridge University Press, p.1240 </ref> After her father's death, her mother brought her children wearing garlands into the hippodrome and presented them as suppliants to the crowd. Most of the information from this earliest part of her life comes from the [[Procopius#Secret_History|''Secret History'']] of [[Procopius]], published posthumously. Critics of Procopius (whose work reveals a man seriously disillusioned with his rulers) have dismissed his work as a severely biased source, vitriolic and pornographic, but have been unable to discredit some of its facts.

Procopius narrates: "He [Justinian] took a wife: and in what manner she was born and bred, and, wedded to this man, tore up the Roman Empire by the very roots, I shall now relate. Acacius was the keeper of wild beasts used in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|amphitheater in Constantinople]]; he belonged to the [[Chariot racing|Green faction]] and was nicknamed the Bearkeeper. This man, during the rule of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]], fell sick and died, leaving three daughters named Comito, Theodora and Anastasia: of whom the eldest was not yet seven years old. His widow took a second husband, who with her undertook to keep up Acacius' family and profession. But Asterius, the dancing master of the Greens, on being bribed by another, removed this office from them and assigned it to the man who gave him the money. For the dancing masters had the power of distributing such positions as they wished." <ref> [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/procop-anec.html Procopius of Caesarea, The Secret History, chapter 9. 1927 translation by Richard Atwater.]</ref> James Allan Evans, a modern historian, notes that animal acts appeared as [[entr'acte]]s between chariot races. The post of [[Animal training|animal trainer]] for the various factions often passed from father to son. But Acacius left no son and the second husband of his widow had a weaker claim to the position. <ref>[http://www.roman-emperors.org/dora.htm James Allan Evans, "Theodora (Wife of Justinian I)"]</ref>

"When this woman saw the populace assembled in the amphitheater, she placed [[laurel wreath]]s on her daughters' heads and in their hands, and sent them out to sit on the ground in the attitude of suppliants. The Greens eyed this mute appeal with indifference; but the Blues were moved to bestow on the children an equal office, since their own animal-keeper had just died. When these children reached the age of girlhood, their mother put them on the local stage, for they were fair to look upon; she sent them forth, however, not all at the same time, but as each one seemed to her to have reached a suitable age. Comito, indeed, had already become one of the leading [[hetaera]]e [high class prostitutes] of the day." <ref> [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/procop-anec.html Procopius of Caesarea, The Secret History, chapter 9. 1927 translation by Richard Atwater.]</ref> Evans notes that Theodora would later favor the Blues as an empress. Which could point to them having earned her loyalty through saving her family from the threat of unemployment and poverty.; <ref>[http://www.roman-emperors.org/dora.htm James Allan Evans, "Theodora (Wife of Justinian I)"]</ref>"Theodora, the second sister, dressed in a little [[tunic]] with sleeves, like a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave girl]], waited on Comito and used to follow her about carrying on her shoulders the bench on which her favored sister was wont to sit at public gatherings. <ref> [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/procop-anec.html Procopius of Caesarea, The Secret History, chapter 9. 1927 translation by Richard Atwater.]</ref>

===Marriage===

John Malalas records that Comito married general [[Sittas]] in 528. The marriage is also recorded by Theophanes and Cedrenus. <ref>Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 329</ref> Sittas and Comito may be the parents of [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]], who would succeed [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]] as the Byzantine Empress. Sophia is recorded as a niece to Theodora. <ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/15C*.html#note192 J. B. Bury, ''History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian'' (1923)]</ref>. Whether Anastasia ever married is unknown. <ref name=Garland>[http://www.roman-emperors.org/sophia.htm Lynda Garland, "Sophia, Wife of Justin II"]</ref>
