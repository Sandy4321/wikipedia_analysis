The '''nunchucks''' is a traditional [[Okinawan weapon]] consisting of two sticks connected at their ends with a short chain or rope.

==Etymology==
The Japanese word ''nunchaku'' is generally believed to derive from the [[Japan]]ese pronunciation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for a [[two section staff]].<ref>{{Cite book|author = [[Wong Kiew Kit]] |title = The Complete Book Of Shaolin Kung Fu |year = 2002 |publisher = Cosmos Internet Sdn Bhd |location = Sungei Petani, Kedah, Malaysia}}</ref>

==Origins==
[[File:muge.jpg|thumb|Okinawan horse bit "muge"'s leg]]
The popular belief is that nunchucks were originally a short [[Southeast Asia]]n [[flail (agriculture)|flail]]<ref>{{Cite book|author = [[Donn F. Draeger]] & Rober W. Smith |title = Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts |year = 1969 |isbn =978-0-87011-436-6 }}</ref> used to thresh [[rice]] or [[soybeans]] (that is, separate the [[cereal|grain]] from the husk). It is possible that it was developed in response to the moratorium on edged weaponry under the [[Satsuma]] [[daimyo]] after invading Okinawa in the 17th century, and that the weapon was most likely conceived and used exclusively for that end, as the configuration of actual flails and bits are unwieldy for use as a weapon. Also, peasant farmers were forbidden conventional weaponry such as arrows or blades so they improvised using only what they had available say, farm tools such as the [[Kama (weapon)|sickle]].

However, it seems that mythology surrounding the origins of nunchucks has little historical accuracy. Unlike Okinawan rice flail (''utzu''), original nunchucks had curved arms, resembling an Okinawan horse bit (''muge''), which gave rise to the theory that nunchucks were originally a horse [[bridle]].<ref name="nunchaku.tripod.com">[http://nunchaku.tripod.com/about_e.htm The real history of nunchucks]</ref> Yet another theory asserts that it was adapted from an instrument carried by the village night watch, made of two blocks of wood joined by cord. The night watch would hit the blocks of wood together to attract people's attention and then warn them about fires and other dangers.<ref>[http://www.oks-online.com/Weapons/nunchaku.htm OKS Nunchaku]</ref> According to [[China|Chinese]] folklore, nunchucks are a variation of the [[two section staff]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Art of Shaolin Kung Fu|last= Kit|first= Wong Kiew|authorlink= [[Wong Kiew Kit]]|year= 1996|publisher= Element Books|isbn= 1-85230-789-7|page= 159}}</ref>

Associating nunchucks and other [[Okinawan weapons]] with rebellious peasants is probably a part of romantic imagery. Martial arts on Okinawa were practiced exclusively by aristocracy ([[kazoku]]) and "serving nobles" ([[Pechin#Okinawan Caste System|shizoku]]) but were prohibited among commoners (''heimin''). Furthermore, Okinawan disarmament was never total; nobles were still allowed to carry their swords and members of the royal family and princes were even allowed to have rifles for hunting.<ref name="nunchaku.tripod.com"/> Whatever its origins were, the nunchucks were not a popular weapon, evidenced by the fact that no known traditional nunchucks [[kata]] exists. This was possibly a result of its lack of efficiency against weapons such as the [[katana|sword]].<ref>[http://www.itna.ch/histoire_nunch_en.htm History of nunchucks]</ref>

==Construction==
Nunchucks are two sections of [[wood]] connected by a cord or chain, though variants may include additional sections of wood and chain. In China, the striking stick is called "dragon stick" ("<U+9F8D><U+68CD>") while the handle is called "yang stick" ("<U+967D><U+68CD>"). Chinese nunchucks tend to be rounded, whereas the Okinawan version has an octagonal cross-section (allowing one edge of the nunchucks to make contact on the target increasing the damage inflicted). The ideal length of each piece should be long enough to protect the forearm when held in a high grip near the top of the shaft. Both ends are usually of equal length, although asymmetrical nunchucks exist. The ideal length for the connecting rope/chain is just enough to allow the user to lay it over his or her palm, with the sticks hanging comfortably and perpendicular to the ground. Weight balance is extremely important; cheaper or gimmicky nunchucks (such as glow-in-the-dark ones) are often not properly balanced, which prevents the performer from doing the more advanced and flashier 'low-grip' moves, such as overhand twirls. The weight should be balanced towards the outer edges of the sticks for maximum ease and control of the swing arcs.

Traditional nunchucks are made from a strong, flexible hardwood such as [[oak]], [[loquat]] or [[pasania]]. Originally, the wood would be submerged in mud for several years, where lack of oxygen and optimal acidity prevented rotting and caused the wood to harden. The rope is made from horsehair. Finally, the wood is very finely sanded and rubbed with an oil or stain for preservation. Today, such nunchucks are often varnished or painted for display purposes. This practice tends to reduce the grip and make the weapon harder to handle, and so is not advised for a combat weapon.

Modern nunchucks can be made from any suitable material, such as wood, metal, or almost any [[plastic]], [[fiberglass]] or other hard substance. Toy and practice nunchucks are commonly covered with foam to prevent self-injury or the injury of others. It is not uncommon to see modern nunchucks made from light [[metal]]s such as [[aluminum]]. Modern equivalents of the rope are [[nylon]] cord or metal chains on ball bearing joints. Simple nunchucks may be easily constructed from wooden dowels and a short length of chain.

The Nunchaku-Do sport, governed by the World Nunchaku Association, promotes black and yellow [[Styrofoam]] nunchucks. Unlike readily available plastic training nunchucks, the devices they promote are properly balanced.

There are some alternative nunchucks, made solely for sporting such as:
*''Bleeder'' (nunchucks with sharp or dull razor blades) and ''sharper'' (nunchucks with nails) are used as components of the basic training and grading programme (Programme Verhille) in French ''nunchaku de combat''.<ref>[http://nenbushi.free.fr/Nunchaku/programme_verhille.htm Programme Verhille]</ref>
*Glow-Chucks, made either with fiberglass and a coloured light fitted in the ball bearing or fluorescent tape wrapped around the sticks.
*Penchaku or "Prochux", which are flashier Lissajous-do sticks available for artistic performances. These are more colourful and sometimes fluorescent with a modified anatomy which favors control in expense of power; they have longer length sticks and extremely short ropes. The idea is based on a mathematical model, the [[Lissajous curve]], which allows the user to keep a continuous flowing form.

There are also some types of nunchucks with no sportive use noted, such as:
*nunchucks with knives, nunchucks with metal branches with a concealed blade in the end of each branch.<ref>[http://www.nunchaku-sfw.com/index.php?tab=dossiers&page=dossiers_divers&art=divers_armes_derivees Les armes d<U+00E9>riv<U+00E9>es du Nunchaku]</ref>
*Telescopic nunchucks, nunchucks with retractable metal sticks.

==Formal styles==
Nunchucks are most commonly used in [[Okinawan kobudo]] and [[karate]], but it is also used in [[eskrima]] (accurately, the [[tabak-toyok]], a similar though distinct Philippine weapon is used, as opposed to the Okinawan nunchaku), [[taekwondo]] and [[hapkido]]. Its application is different in each style. The traditional [[Okinawan martial arts|Okinawan forms]] use the sticks primarily to grip and lock. [[Filipino martial art]]ists use it much the same way they would wield a stick, so striking is given precedence. [[Korean martial arts|Korean systems]] combine offensive and defensive moves so both locks and strikes are taught.

Nunchucks are usually wielded singly but they can also be paired. It can be whirled around, using its hardened handles for blunt force as well as wrapping its chain around an attacking weapon to immobilise or disarm the opponent. Nunchucks training has been noted to increase hand speed, correct posture, and condition the hands of the practitioner so it makes a useful training weapon.

There are some disciplines that combine nunchucks with unarmed techniques:

* ''Mouh<U+00E9>bong Taekwondo'' combines Korean nunchucks with taekwondo.<ref>[http://www.paristaekwondo.com/en/ateliers_nunchaku_coreen_Taekwondo.php Korean Nunchaku (Mouh<U+00E9>bong Taekwondo)]</ref>
* ''Nunch-Boxing'' combines nunchucks with kicking and punching techniques. Nunch-Boxing itself is part of the broader discipline ''Nenbushi''.<ref>[http://nenbushi.free.fr/le_nenbushi.htm France Nenbushi]</ref>
* ''Nunchaku en savate'' combines [[savate]] techniques with the nunchucks.<ref>[http://members.bellatlantic.net/~eynard/nunchaku_en_savate.html Nunchaku en savate]</ref>

==Freestyle==<!-- This section is linked from [[Freestyle]] -->
[[Freestyle nunchaku]] is a modern style of performance art using nunchaku as a visual tool rather than as a weapon. With the growing prevalence of the Internet the availability of nunchaku has increased greatly, combining this with the popularity of other video sharing sites many people have become interested in learning how to use the weapons for freestyle displays. Freestyle is one discipline of competition held by the ''World Nunchaku Association''. Some modern martial arts teach the use of nunchaku as it may help students improve their reflexes, hand control, and other skills.

==Sportive associations==
Since the [[1980s]], there have been various international sportive associations that organise the use of nunchucks as a contact sport.<ref>[http://nunchaku.free.fr/histonunch.html Historique du Nunchaku de combat]</ref><ref>[http://www.nunchakusaida.com/history.htm Nunchaku Saida - History]</ref> Current associations usually hold ''semi-contact'' fights where severe strikes are prohibited as opposed to ''contact'' fights. ''Full-Nunch'' matches, on the other hand, are limitations-free on the severity of strikes and [[KO]] is permissible.<ref>[http://nenbushi.free.fr/Nenbushi/historique.htm Nenbushi Historique]</ref>
*The North American Nunchaku Association was founded in 2003 in California, USA by Sensei Chris Pellitteri.  NANA teaches all aspects of the nunchucks, traditional and free-style: single and double.
*''World Amateur Nunchaku Organization'' (WANO): Founded by Pascal Verhille in [[France]] in 1988.
*''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Nunchaku de Combat et Artistique'' (FINCA): Founded by Rapha<U+00EB>l Schmitz in France in 1992, as a merger of disbanded associations WANO and FFNS (F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Fran<U+00E7>aise de Nunchaku Sportif). Its current name is ''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Nunchaku, Combat complet et Arts martiaux modernes et affinitaires'' (FINCA).<ref>[http://fincaweb.free.fr/ FINCA]</ref> A fight with FINCA rules lasts 2 x 2 minutes. There is no need changing neither nunchaku branch nor hand before hitting, just a correct recuperation is asked. There is no stop during the fight except in case of loss, lifting or penalties.
*''World Nunchaku Association'' (WNA): Founded by Milco Lambrecht in the [[Netherlands]] in 1996.<ref>[http://www.nunchaku-do.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=50&Itemid=78 The WNA]</ref> They use yellow and black plastic weight-balanced training nunchaku and protective headgear. They have their own belt colour system where one earns colour stripes on the belt instead of using fully coloured belts. One side of the belt is yellow, and the other black, so that in a competition, opponents may be distinguished by the visible side of the belt. WNA rules fight corresponds to the ''[[kumite]]'' subsection of Nunchaku-do discipline.<ref>[http://www.nunchaku-do.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30&Itemid=59 WNA Kumite]</ref> It is a 2-minutes "touch fight" in which the technical abilities are very important. After each scored point, the fight stops and the fighters take back their starting position.
*''International Techdo Nunchaku Association'' (ITNA): Founded by Daniel Althaus in [[Switzerland]] in 2006. ITNA rules fight lasts 2 x 2:30 minutes. There is no stop during the round, except in case of loss, lifting or penalties. Between two strikes, the fighter has to change hand and nunchucks branch before hitting again, except if he does a block.

==Legality==
Possession of nunchucks is illegal in a number of countries including [[Norway]], [[Canada]],<ref>[http://ejmas.com/tin/2004tin/tinart_agnew_0104.html legality of martial arts weapons in Canada]</ref> [[Russia]] and [[Spain]]. It is considered a prohibited weapon.<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-98-462/latest/sor-98-462.html Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted, SOR/98-462]. Canlii. Accessed 2010/06/30</ref> In [[Germany]] nunchucks have been illegal<ref>[[Waffengesetz (Deutschland)|WaffG]] Anlage 2 (Waffenliste), Abschnitt 1, Ziffer 1.3.8</ref> since April 2006, when it was declared as a strangling weapon.<ref>Feststellungsbescheid des [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] from 5. February 2004, AZ KT21 / ZV 5-5164.02-Z-23/2004</ref>
In the [[United Kingdom]] for many years it was thought legal for anyone over the age of 18 to buy and possess nunchucks, although public possession is not allowed unless transporting between a place of training or private addresses. However, following a case brought by Strathclyde Police and the Procurator Fiscal heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court on the 10th February 2010, a Sheriff ruled that nunchucks fell into the category of a prohibited weapon as defined by the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) Order 1988 Section 141 (n). If, and only if it were upheld by a senior court, this ruling would have the effect of making it an offence to import, manufacture or sell nunchucks in the UK. It would also criminalise hundreds of thousands of martial arts enthusiasts who own a set of nunchucks. Their usage was, in the 1990s, censored from broadcasts of American children's TV shows such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' cartoons and films in the UK.<ref name="ezine.kungfumagazine.com">{{Cite news|title= TMNT: The Rennaissance Reptiles Return|work= Kung Fu Magazine|date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=703|accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> The UK version of the ''[[Soul Edge|Soul Blade]]'' videogame was also edited, replacing a character's nunchucks with a three-sectioned staff. In [[Hong Kong]], it is illegal to possess metal or wooden nunchucks connected by a chain. It can be possessed by obtaining a license from the police as a [[martial arts]] instructor. Any rubber nunchucks are allowed. However, possession of nunchucks in [[People's Republic of China|Mainland China]] is legal.

Legality in [[Australia]] is also determined by individual state laws.  In [[New South Wales]], the weapon is on the restricted weapons list, and thus can only be owned with a permit.

Legality in the [[United States]] varies at state level, e.g., personal possession of nunchucks is illegal in [[New York]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}, [[Arizona]]<ref>[http://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/03101.htm Arizona Revised Statutes Title 13 Section 3101]</ref>
, [[California]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and [[Massachusetts]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}, but in other states possession has not been criminalized.  In New York, [[lawyer|attorney]] Jim Maloney has brought a federal constitutional challenge to the statutes that criminalize simple in-home possession of nunchucks for peaceful use in martial-arts practice or legal home defense.<ref>[http://www.nunchakulaw.com www.nunchakulaw.com]</ref>  As of June 29, 2010,  the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has granted a writ of [[certiorari]] in favor of Maloney and has sent it back to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] for "further consideration".
