== Route description ==

Highway 116 begins at the intersection of [[Wisconsin Highway 91]] (also known as Waukau Avenue) and County Road M just outside [[Waukau, Wisconsin|Waukau]]. Heading north through the town, it continues in a generally northern direction until it reaches County Highway E (Fourth Street Road) on the outskirts of [[Omro, Wisconsin|Omro]]. 

Turning briefly on Fourth Street Road, it then resumes north on Waukau Road past the Omro Cemetery into the city. Once in Omro, WIS 116 heads north on Jefferson Avenue to Main Street, on the south side of the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]]. 

Joining [[Wisconsin Highway 21|WIS 21]], it heads west for a block before crossing the river. On the north bank of the river, WIS 21 heads west while WIS 116 heads east on River Drive, until it splits to the north onto Willow Street. Continuing northwest out of the city, Highway 116 becomes Achterberg Road until it reaches Main Street in [[Winneconne, Wisconsin|Winneconne]]. 

Crossing over the [[Wolf River (Fox River)|Wolf River]] in downtown Winneconne, WIS 116 heads east to its terminus at the interchange with [[U.S. Highway 45 (Wisconsin)|US 45]] near the northern shore of [[Lake Butte des Morts]].  

==History==

In the most recent iteration of the highway, WIS 116 originally ran further west to the city of [[Berlin, Wisconsin|Berlin]]. In 1996, according to Chris Bessert's [http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys110-119.html#STH-116|Wisconsin Highways] <ref name="WH2"/>, the route was transferred to [[Wisconsin Highway 91|WIS 91]].
