An '''action potential''' is a short-lasting event in which the electrical [[membrane potential]] of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a stereotyped trajectory.  Action potentials occur in several types of [[excitable cell]]s, including [[neuron]]s, [[myocyte|muscle cells]], and [[endocrine]] cells.  In neurons, they play a central role in cell-to-cell communication.  In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes.  In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  In [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreas]], they provoke release of [[insulin]].<ref name="pmid16464129">{{ cite journal | author = MacDonald PE, Rorsman P | title = Oscillations, intercellular coupling, and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = e49 | year = 2006 | month = February | pmid = 16464129 | pmc = 1363709 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040049 | url = | issn = }}</ref>  Action potentials in neurons are also known as "nerve impulses" or "spikes", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its "spike train".  A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to "fire".

Action potentials are generated by special types of [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s embedded in a cell's [[plasma membrane]].<ref name="pmid17515599">{{cite journal | author = Barnett MW, Larkman PM | title = The action potential | journal = Pract Neurol | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 192<U+2013>7 | year = 2007 | month = June | pmid = 17515599 | doi = | url = http://pn.bmj.com/content/7/3/192.short | issn = }}</ref>  These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the [[resting potential]] of the cell, but rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined threshold value.  When the channels open, they allow an inward flow of electrical current, which produces a further rise in the membrane potential.  This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electrical current, etc.  The process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open, resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential, often to the extent of briefly reversing its polarity.  The ion channels then rapidly inactivate, allowing the membrane potential to drop back to its baseline level, sometimes speeded by other types of voltage-gated ion channels which are active specifically during the falling phase of an action potential.

In animal cells there are two primary types of action potentials, one type generated by voltage-gated [[sodium]] channels, the other by voltage-gated [[calcium]] channels.  Sodium-based action potentials usually last for less than one millisecond, whereas calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer.  In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly-emitted sodium spikes.  In cardiac muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a "primer" to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.

Recordings of action potentials are often distorted compared to the schematic view because of variations in [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] techniques used to make the recording.|alt=Two plots of the membrane potential (measured in mV) versus time (ms). Top: idealized plot where the membrane potential starts out at - 70 mV at time zero.  A stimulus is applied at time = 1 ms, which raises the membrane potential above -55 mV (the threshold potential).  After the stimulus is applied, the membrane potential rapidly rises to a peak potential of + 40 mV at time = 2 ms.  Just as quickly, the potential then drops and overshoots to -90 mV at time = 3 ms and finally the resting potential of -70 mV is reestablished at time = 5 ms. Bottom: a plot of an experimentally determined action potential that is very similar in appearance to the idealized plot except that the peak is much sharper and the initial drop is to -50 mV increasing to -30 mV before dropping back to the resting potential of -70 mV.]]
All cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized<U+2014>in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's [[plasma membrane]], known as the membrane potential.  As explained in the [[membrane potential]] article, this electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s and [[ion channel]]s.  In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the [[dendrite]]s, [[axon]], and [[soma (biology)|cell body]] different electrical properties.  As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials) while others are not.  The most excitable part of a neuron is usually the [[axon hillock]] (the point where the axon leaves the cell body), but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases.

Each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential:  the [[resting potential]], which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the [[threshold potential]].  At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around -55 mV.  Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall.  Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold.  When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward, often reaching as high as +100 mV, then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time.  The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is, the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell.  (Exceptions are discussed later in the article.)   In most neurons, the entire process takes place in less than a thousandth of a second.  Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10-100 per second; some types, however, are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.

At the biophysical level, action potentials result from special types of [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s.  As the membrane potential is increased, [[sodium channel|sodium ion channels]] open, allowing the entry of [[sodium]] ions into the cell. This is followed by the opening of [[potassium channel|potassium ion channels]] that permit the exit of [[potassium]] ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively-charged [[cation]]s in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's [[resting potential]]. The sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizes]] the cell. For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically <U+2212>70&nbsp;mV.<ref name="failed_initiations">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 150<U+2013>151; Junge, pp. 89<U+2013>90; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], p. 484.</ref>  However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15&nbsp;mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the [[positive feedback]] from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell "fires," producing an action potential.<ref name="positive_feedback" /><ref>In general, while this simple description of action potential initiation is accurate, it does not explain phenomena such as excitation block (the ability to prevent neurons from eliciting action potentials by stimulating them with large current steps) and the ability to elicit action potentials by briefly hyperpolarizing the membrane. By analyzing the dynamics of a system of sodium and potassium channels in a membrane patch using [[computational model]]s, however, these phenomena are readily explained (http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/FitzHugh-Nagumo_model).</ref>

Currents produced by the opening of voltage-gated channels in the course of an action potential are typically  significantly larger than the initial stimulating current.  Thus the amplitude, duration, and shape of the action potential are largely determined by the properties of the excitable membrane and not the amplitude or duration of the stimulus.  This all-or-nothing property of action potential sets it apart from [[graded potential]]s such as [[receptor potential]]s, [[electrotonic potential]]s, and [[synaptic potential]]s, which do scale with the magnitude of the stimulus. A variety of action potential types exist in many cell types and cell  compartments as determined by the types of voltage-gated channels, [[leak channels]],  channel distributions, ionic concentrations, membrane capacitance, temperature, and other factors.  

The principal ions involved in an action potential are sodium and potassium cations; sodium ions enter the cell, and potassium ions leave, restoring equilibrium. Relatively few ions need to cross the membrane for the membrane voltage to change drastically. The ions exchanged during an action potential, therefore, make a negligible change in the interior and exterior ionic concentrations. The few ions that do cross are pumped out again by the continual action of the [[Na<U+207A>/K<U+207A>-ATPase|sodium<U+2013>potassium pump]], which, with other [[ion transporter]]s, maintains the normal ratio of ion concentrations across the membrane.  [[Calcium]] cations and [[chloride]] [[anion]]s are involved in a few types of action potentials, such as the [[cardiac action potential]] and the action potential in the single-celled [[algae|alga]] ''[[Acetabularia]]'', respectively.

Although action potentials are generated locally on patches of excitable membrane, the resulting currents can trigger action potentials on neighboring stretches of membrane, precipitating a domino-like propagation.  In contrast to passive spread of electric potentials ([[electrotonic potential]]), action potentials are generated anew along excitable stretches of membrane and  propagate without decay.<ref name="no_decrement">[[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], p. 484.</ref> Myelinated sections of axons are not excitable and do not produce action potentials and the signal is propagated passively as [[electrotonic potential]].  Regularly spaced unmyelinated patches, called the [[nodes of Ranvier]], generate action potentials to boost the signal.   Known as [[saltatory conduction]], this type of signal propagation provides a favorable tradeoff of signal velocity and axon diameter.  Depolarization of [[axon terminal]]s, in general, triggers the release of [[neurotransmitter]] into the [[synaptic cleft]]. In addition, backpropagating action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of [[pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]], which are ubiquitous in the neocortex.<ref name="backpropagation_in_pyramidal_cells">{{cite journal | author = Golding NL, Kath WL, Spruston N | title = Dichotomy of action-potential backpropagation in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites | journal = J.

[[Image:Diffusion.en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Ions (pink circles) will flow across a membrane from the higher concentration to the lower concentration (down a concentration gradient), causing a current.

Ions cross the cell membrane under two influences: [[diffusion]] and [[electric field]]s. A simple example wherein two solutions - A and B - are separated by a porous barrier illustrates that diffusion will ensure that they will eventually mix into equal solutions. This mixing occurs because of the difference in their concentrations. The region with high concentration will diffuse out toward the region with low concentration. To extend the example, let solution A have 30 sodium ions and 30 chloride ions. Also, let solution B have only 20 sodium ions and 20 chloride ions. Assuming the barrier allows both types of ions to travel through it, then a steady state will be reached whereby both solutions have 25 sodium ions and 25 chloride ions. If, however, the porous barrier is selective to which ions are let through, then diffusion alone will not determine the resulting solution. Returning to the previous example, let's now construct a barrier that is permeable only to sodium ions. Since solution B has a lower concentration of both sodium and chloride, the barrier will attract both ions from solution A. However, only sodium will travel through the barrier. This will result in an accumulation of sodium in solution B. Since sodium has a positive charge, this accumulation will make solution B more positive relative to solution A. Positive sodium ions will be less likely to travel to the now-more-positive B solution. This constitutes the second factor controlling ion flow, namely electric fields. The point at which this electric field completely counteracts the force due to diffusion is called the equilibrium potential. At this point, the net flow of this specific ion (in this case sodium) is zero.

[[Image:CellMembraneDrawing.jpg|thumb|left|The hydrophobic [[cell membrane]] prevents charged molecules from easily diffusing through it, permitting a [[transmembrane potential|potential difference]] to exist across the membrane.|alt=A cartoon diagram depicting a cross sectional view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with imbedded proteins.  The bilayer in turn is composed of two layers of phospholipids where the hydrophobic lipid portion of the two layers face each other while the hydrophilic phosphate portion faces water.  Hence the the bilayer is divided into three regions: two external polar surfaces in contact with water separated by a hydrophobic interior.]]

===Cell membrane===
Each neuron is encased in a [[cell membrane]], made of a [[phospholipid]] bilayer. This membrane is nearly impermeable to [[ion]]s.<ref name="lieb_1986">{{cite book | author= Lieb WR, Stein WD | year = 1986 | chapter = Chapter 2.

Ion pumps use the cell's energy to continuously move ions in and out. They create concentration differences (between the inside and outside of the neuron) by transporting ions against their concentration gradients (from regions of low concentration to regions of high concentration). The ion channels then use this concentration difference to transport ions down their concentration gradients (from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration). However, unlike the continuous transport by the ion pumps, the transport by the ion channels is noncontinuous. They open and close in response to signals only from their environment. This transport of ions through the ion channels then changes the voltage of the cell membrane. These changes are what bring about an action potential. As an analogy, ion pumps play the role of the battery that allows a radio circuit (the ion channels) to transmit a signal (action potential).<ref name="Purves">{{cite book | author = D Purves, GJ Augustine, D Fitzpatrick, WC Hall, A-S LaMantia, JO McNamara, LE White | title = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=neurosci.chapter.227 Neuroscience] | edition = 4th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | location = Sunderland, MA | isbn =  978-0-87893-697-7 | year = 2007}}</ref>

====Membrane potential====
The cell membrane acts as a barrier that prevents the inside solution (intracellular fluid) from mixing with the outside solution (extracellular fluid). These two solutions have different concentrations of their ions. Furthermore, this difference in concentrations leads to a difference in charge of the solutions. This creates a situation whereby one solution is more positive than the other. Therefore, positive ions will tend to gravitate towards the negative solution. Likewise, negative ions will tend to gravitate towards the positive solution. To quantify this property, one would like to somehow capture this relative positivity (or negativity). To do this, the outside solution is set as the zero voltage. Then the difference between the inside voltage and the zero voltage is determined. For example, if the outside voltage is 100 mV, and the inside voltage is 30 mV, then the difference is 70 mV. This difference is what is commonly referred to as the [[membrane potential]].

===Ion channels===
{{Main|Ion channel|Passive transport}}

[[Ion channel]]s are [[integral membrane protein]]s with a pore through which ions can travel between extracellular space and cell interior.  Most channels are specific (selective) for one ion; for example, most potassium channels are characterized by 1000:1 selectivity ratio for potassium over sodium, though potassium and sodium ions have the same charge and differ only slightly in their radius.  The channel pore is typically so small that ions must pass through it in single-file order.<ref name="doyle_1998" /><ref name="eisenman_theory">{{cite book | author = Eisenman G | year = 1961 | chapter = On the elementary atomic origin of equilibrium ionic specificity | title = Symposium on Membrane Transport and Metabolism | editors = A Kleinzeller, A Kotyk, eds. | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York | pages = 163<U+2013>79}}{{cite book | author = Eisenman G | year = 1965 | chapter = Some elementary factors involved in specific ion permeation | title = Proc. 23rd Int.

When a channel is open, ions permeate through the channel pore down the transmembrane concentration gradient for that particular ion. Rate of ionic flow through the channel, i.e. single-channel current amplitude, is determined by the maximum channel conductance and electrochemical driving force for that ion, which is the difference between instantaneous value of the membrane potential and the value of the [[reversal potential]].<ref name="junge_33_37">Junge, pp. 33<U+2013>37.</ref>

A channel may have several different states (corresponding to different [[protein structure|conformations]] of the protein), but each such state is either open or closed.  In general, closed states correspond either to a contraction of the pore <U+2014> making it impassable to the ion <U+2014> or to a separate part of the protein, stoppering the pore.   For example, the voltage-dependent sodium channel undergoes ''inactivation'', in which a portion of the protein swings into the pore, sealing it.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cai SQ, Li W, Sesti F |title=Multiple modes of a-type potassium current regulation |journal=Curr.

Other ion channels open and close with mechanical forces.

===Ion pumps===
{{Main|Ion transporter|Active transport}}

The ionic currents of the action potential flow in response to [[concentration]] differences of the ions across the [[cell membrane]].  These concentration differences are established by [[ion transporter|ion pumps]], which are [[integral membrane protein]]s that carry out [[active transport]], i.e., use cellular energy (ATP) to "pump" the ions against their concentration gradient.<ref name="hodgkin_1955">{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Richard Keynes|Keynes RD]] | year = 1955 | title = Active transport of cations in giant axons from ''Sepia'' and ''Loligo'' | journal = J.

Ion pumps influence the action potential only by establishing the relative ratio of intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations.  The action potential involves mainly the opening and closing of ion channels, not ion pumps.  If the ion pumps are turned off by removing their energy source, or by adding an inhibitor such as [[ouabain]], the axon can still fire hundreds of thousands of action potentials before their amplitudes begin to decay significantly.<ref name="hodgkin_1955" />  In particular, ion pumps play no significant role in the repolarization of the membrane after an action potential.<ref name="bullock_140_141" />

===Resting potential===
{{Main|Resting potential|Membrane potential|Reversal potential}}

As described in the section [[Action potential#Ions and the forces driving their motion|Ions and the forces driving their motion]], equilibrium or reversal potential of an ion is the value of transmembrane voltage at which the electric force generated by diffusional movement of the ion down its concentration gradient becomes equal to the molecular force of that diffusion. The equilibrium potential for any ion can be calculated using the [[Nernst equation]].<ref name="nernst">Purves ''et al.'', pp. 28<U+2013>32; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 133<U+2013>134; Schmidt-Nielsen, pp. 478<U+2013>480, 596<U+2013>597; Junge, pp. 33<U+2013>35</ref><ref name="bernstein_1902_1912"/> For example, reversal potential for potassium ions will be as follows

:<math>  E_{eq,K^+} = \frac{RT}{zF} \ln \frac{[K^+]_{o}}{[K^+]_{i}} , </math>

where
*''E''<sub>eq,K<sup>+</sup></sub> is the equilibrium potential for potassium, measured in [[volt]]s
*''R'' is the universal [[gas constant]], equal to 8.314 [[joule|J]]<U+00B7>K<sup><U+2212>1</sup><U+00B7>mol<sup><U+2212>1</sup>
*''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]], measured in [[kelvin]]s (temperature in kelvins equals degrees Celsius + 273.15)
*''z'' is the number of [[elementary charge]]s of the ion in question involved in the reaction
*''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]], equal to 96,485 [[coulomb|C]]<U+00B7>mol<sup><U+2212>1</sup> or J<U+00B7>V<sup><U+2212>1</sup><U+00B7>mol<sup><U+2212>1</sup>

*[K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is the intracellular concentration of potassium.

Even if two different ions have the same charge (i.e. K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>), they can still have very different equilibrium potentials, provided their outside and/or inside concentrations differ. Take, for example, the equilibrium potentials of potassium and sodium in neurons. The potassium equilibrium potential ''E''<sub>K</sub> is -84 mV with 5 mmol/L potassium outside and 140 mmol/L inside. The sodium equilibrium potential, on the other hand,  ''E''<sub>Na</sub> is approximately +40 mV with 1<U+2013>2 mmol/L sodium inside and 120 mmol/L outside.<ref group=note>Membrane potentials are defined relative to the exterior of the cell; thus, a potential of <U+2212>70 mV implies that the interior of the cell is negative relative to the exterior.</ref> 

However, there is an equilibrium membrane potential ''E''<sub>''m''</sub> at which the ''net'' flow of all ions across the membrane is zero. This potential is calculated by the [[Goldman equation]]<ref name="Goldman">Purves ''et al.'', pp. 32<U+2013>33; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 138<U+2013>140; Schmidt-Nielsen, pp. 480; Junge, pp. 35<U+2013>37</ref><ref name="goldman_1943" />  In essence, it is the Nernst equation, in that it is based on the charges of the ions in question, as well as the difference between their inside and outside concentrations. However, it also takes into consideration the relative permeability of the plasma membrane to each ion in question. 

:<math>
E_{m} = \frac{RT}{F} \ln{ \left( \frac{ P_{\mathrm{K}}[\mathrm{K}^{+}]_\mathrm{out} + P_{\mathrm{Na}}[\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_\mathrm{out} + P_{\mathrm{Cl}}[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_\mathrm{in}}{ P_{\mathrm{K}}[\mathrm{K}^{+}]_\mathrm{in} + P_{\mathrm{Na}}[\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_\mathrm{in} + P_{\mathrm{Cl}}[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_\mathrm{out}} \right) }

for the three monovalent ions most important to action potentials: potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), and chloride (Cl<sup><U+2212></sup>). Being an anion, the chloride terms are treated differently than the cation terms; the inside concentration is in the numerator, and the outside concentration is in the denominator, which is reversed from the cation terms. ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> stands for the [[permeation|permeability]] of the ion type ''i''.  If calcium ions are also considered, which are critically important for action potentials in muscles, the formula for the equilibrium potential becomes more complicated.<ref name="goldman_calcium">{{cite journal | author = Spangler SG | year = 1972 | title = Expansion of the constant field equation  to include both divalent and monovalent ions | journal = Ala J Med Sci | volume = 9 | pages = 218<U+2013>23|pmid=5045041 | issue = 2 }}</ref>

Generation of [[resting membrane potential]] is explicitly explained by the Goldman equation. The resting plasma membrane of most animal cells is much more permeable to K<sup>+</sup>, which results in the resting potential ''V''<sub>rest</sub> to be close to the potassium equilibrium potential.<ref name="resting_potential">Purves ''et al.'', p. 34; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, p. 134; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], pp. 478<U+2013>480.</ref><ref name="hodgkin_1949" /><ref>Purves ''et al.'', pp. 33<U+2013>36; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, p. 131.</ref> 

It is important to realize that ionic and water permeability of a pure lipid bilayer is very small, and it is, in a similar manner, negligible for ions of comparable size, such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. The cell membranes, however, contain a large number of [[ion channel]]s, water channels ([[aquaporin]]s), and various ionic pumps, exchangers, and transporters, which dramatically and selectively increase permeability of the membrane for different ions. The relatively high membrane permeability for potassium ions at resting potential results from [[Inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]]s, which are open at negative voltages, and so-called leak potassium conductances such as open rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel (ORK<sup>+</sup>), which are locked in open state. These potassium channels should not be confused with voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels responsible for membrane repolarization during action potential.

[[Image:Neurons big1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Action potentials arriving at the synapses of the upper right neuron stimulate currents in its [[dendrite]]s; these currents depolarize the membrane at its [[axon hillock]], provoking an action potential that propagates down the axon to its synaptic knobs, releasing [[neurotransmitter]] and stimulating the post-synaptic neuron (lower left).|alt=A depiction of two neurons where the first upper right neuron is connected through extensions of the cell surface of the neuron known as dendrites to the second lower left neuron.  The main body of the neuron is approximately spherical in shape where the dendrites resemble tree branches that extend from the central body (or "tree trunk") of the neuron. An action potential from the central body of the first cell travels along the surface of its dendrites toward the second cell.  A blowup insert in the figure shows the connection between the dendrite of the first cell to the surface of the second cell.  The end of the dendrite contains neurotransmitters stored in vesicles.  These neurotransmitters are released from the dendrites by an action potential.  The neurotransmitters then diffuse through the solution between the two cells where they bind to cell surface receptors on the second cell.]]

===Anatomy of a neuron===

Several types of cells support an action potential, such as plant cells, muscle cells, and the specialized cells of the heart (in which occurs the [[cardiac action potential]]).  However, the main excitable cell is the [[neuron]], which also has the simplest mechanism for the action potential.

Neurons are electrically excitable cells composed, in general, of one or more [[dendrite]]s, a single soma, a single axon and one or more axon terminals. The dendrite is one of the two types of [[chemical synapse|synapses]], the other being the axon terminal boutons. Dendrites form protrusions in response to the axon terminal boutons. These protrusions, or spines, are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. They have a high concentration of ligand activated channels.  It is, therefore, here where synapses from two neurons communicate with one another. These spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the main dendrite. This ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighbouring spines. The dendritic spine can, therefore, with rare exception (see [[Long-term potentiation#Properties|LTP]]), act as an independent unit. The dendrites then connect onto the [[soma (biology)|soma]]. The soma houses the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], which acts as the regulator for the neuron. Unlike the spines, the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels. These channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites. Emerging out from the soma is the [[axon hillock]]. This region is characterized by having an incredibly high concentration of voltage activated sodium channels. In general, it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials.<ref name="bullock_p11">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, p. 11.</ref> Multiple signals generated at the spines, and transmitted by the soma all converge here. Immediately after the axon hillock is the [[axon]]. This is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma. The axon is insulated by a [[myelin]] sheath. Myelin is composed of [[Schwann cells]] that wrap themselves multiple times around the axonal segment. This forms a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon. This insulation both prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed. This insulation, however, has the restriction that no channels can be present on the surface of the axon. There are, therefore, regularly spaced patches of membrane, which have no insulation. These [[nodes of ranvier]] can be considered to be 'mini axon hillocks' as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay. At the furthest end, the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several axon terminals. These axon terminals then end in the form the second class of synapses, axon terminal buttons. These buttons have voltage-activated calcium channels, which come into play when signaling other neurons.

==Initiation==
Before considering the propagation of action potentials along [[axon]]s and their termination at the synaptic knobs, it is helpful to consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the [[axon hillock]]. The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing.<ref name="rising_phase" /> There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.

[[Image:Synapse Illustration2 tweaked.svg|thumb|left|300px|When an action potential arrives at the end of the pre-synaptic axon (yellow), it causes the release of [[neurotransmitter]] molecules that open ion channels in the post-synaptic neuron (green).  The combined [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] and [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]]s of such inputs can begin a new action potential in the post-synaptic neuron.|alt=The pre- and post-synaptic axons are separated by a short distance known as the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter released by pre-synaptic axons diffuse through the synaptic clef to bind to and open ion channels in post-synaptic axons.]]

===Neurotransmission===
{{Main|Neurotransmission}}

Action potentials are most commonly initiated by [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s from a presynaptic neuron.<ref name="neurotransmission">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 177<U+2013>240; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], pp. 490<U+2013>499; Stevens, pp. 47<U+2013>68.</ref>  Typically, [[neurotransmitter]] molecules are released by the [[synapse|presynaptic]] [[neuron]]. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell.  This binding opens various types of [[ion channel]]s. This opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the [[cell membrane]] and thus the membrane potential. If the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane), the synapse is excitatory. If, however, the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane), it is inhibitory.  Whether the voltage is decreased or increased, the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the [[cable equation]] and its refinements). Typically, the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with the distance from the synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter.  Some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the [[axon hillock]] and may (in rare cases) depolarize the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential.  More typically, the excitatory potentials from several synapses must [[spatial summation|work together]] at [[temporal summation|nearly the same time]] to provoke a new action potential.  Their joint efforts can be thwarted, however, by the counter-acting [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]]s.

Neurotransmission can also occur through [[electrical synapse]]s.<ref name="electrical_synapses">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 178<U+2013>180; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], pp. 490<U+2013>491.</ref>  Due to the direct connection between excitable cells in the form of [[gap junction]]s, an action potential can be transmitted directly from one cell to the next. The free flow of ions between cells enables rapid non-chemical mediated transmission. Rectifying channels ensure that action potentials move only in one direction through an electrical synapse. In the human nervous system this type of synapse is uncommon however.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==="All-or-none" principle===
The [[amplitude]] of an action potential is independent of the amount of current that produced it. In other words, larger currents do not create larger action potentials. Therefore action potentials are said to be ''all-or-none'' (or [[boolean domain|boolean]]), since they either occur fully or they do not occur at all. Instead, the [[frequency]] of action potentials is what encodes for the intensity of a stimulus. This is in contrast to [[receptor potential]]s, whose amplitudes are dependent on the intensity of a stimulus.<ref name="Purves" >{{cite book | author = Dale Purves, et al. | title = Neuroscience (4th Ed.) | publisher = Sinauer | pages = 26<U+2013>28 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-87893-697-7}}</ref>

===Sensory neurons===
{{Main|Sensory neuron}}

In [[sensory neurons]], an external signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is coupled with the opening and closing of [[ion channels]], which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage.<ref name="sensory_neurons">[[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], pp. 535<U+2013>580; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 49<U+2013>56, 76<U+2013>93, 247<U+2013>255; Stevens, 69<U+2013>79</ref>  These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials.  Examples in humans include the [[olfactory receptor neuron]] and [[Meissner's corpuscle]], which are critical for the sense of [[olfaction|smell]] and [[somatosensory system|touch]], respectively.  However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon!<ref name="amacrine_cells">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 53, 122<U+2013>124.</ref>  Instead, they may convert the signal into the release of a [[neurotransmitter]], or into continuous [[receptor potential|graded potentials]], either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential.   For illustration, in the human [[ear]], [[hair cell]]s convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of [[stretch-activated ion channel|mechanically gated ion channels]], which may cause [[neurotransmitter]] molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human [[retina]], the initial [[photoreceptor cell]]s and the next two layers of cells ([[bipolar cell]]s and [[amacrine cell]]s) do not produce action potentials; only the third layer, the [[ganglion cell]]s, produce action potentials, which then travel up the [[optic nerve]].

===Pacemaker potentials===
{{Main|Pacemaker potential}}

[[Image:Pacemaker potential.svg|thumb|right|In [[pacemaker potential]]s, the cell spontaneously depolarizes (straight line with upward slope) until it fires an action potential.|alt=A plot of action potential (mV) vs time.  The membrane potential is initially -60 mV, rise relatively slowly to the threshold potential of -40 mV and then quickly spikes at a potential of +10 mV after which is rapidly returns to the starting -60 mV potential.  The cycle is then repeated.]]

In sensory neurons, action potentials result from an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously depolarize their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a regular rate, like an internal clock.<ref name="pacemakers">Junge, pp. 115<U+2013>132</ref> The voltage traces of such cells are known as [[pacemaker potential]]s.<ref name="pacemaker_potentials">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 152<U+2013>153.</ref>  The [[cardiac pacemaker]] cells of the [[sinoatrial node]] in the [[heart]] provide a good example.<ref name="noble_1960">{{cite journal | author = Noble D | year=1960 | title = Cardiac action and pacemaker potentials based on the Hodgkin-Huxley equations | journal = Nature | volume = 188 | pages = 495<U+2013>497 | doi = 10.1038/188495b0 | pmid = 13729365}}</ref> Although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, [[heart rate]] can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] nerves.<ref name="parasympathetic">[[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 444<U+2013>445.</ref>  The external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing.<ref name="pacemaker_potentials" />  In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as [[bursting]].

==Phases==
The course of the action potential can be divided into five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the undershoot phase, and finally the refractory period. During the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the membrane potential reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the membrane potential hyperpolarizes (becomes more negative). The undershoot phase is the point during which the membrane potential becomes temporarily more negatively charged than when at rest. Finally, the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], which may overlap with the other phases.<ref name="phase_nomenclature" >Purves ''et al.'', p. 38.</ref>    

The course of the action potential is determined by two coupled effects.<ref name="coupling">Stevens, pp. 127<U+2013>128.</ref>  First, voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close in response to changes in the [[membrane potential|membrane voltage]] ''V''<sub>''m''</sub>. This changes the membrane's permeability to those ions.<ref name="permeability_channels" >Purves ''et al.'', pp. 61<U+2013>65.</ref>  Second, according to the [[Goldman equation]], this change in permeability changes in the equilibrium potential ''E''<sub>''m''</sub>, and, thus, the membrane voltage ''V''<sub>''m''</sub>.<ref name="goldman_1943" />  Thus, the membrane potential affects the permeability, which then further affects the membrane potential. This sets up the possibility for [[positive feedback]], which is a key part of the rising phase of the action potential.<ref name="positive_feedback">Purves ''et al.'', pp. 48<U+2013>49; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 141, 150<U+2013>151; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], p. 483; Junge, p. 89; Stevens, p. 127</ref>  A complicating factor is that a single ion channel may have multiple internal "gates" that respond to changes in ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> in opposite ways, or at different rates.<ref name="multiple_gates">Purves ''et al.'', pp. 64<U+2013>74; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 149<U+2013>150; Junge, pp. 84<U+2013>85; Stevens, pp. 152<U+2013>158.</ref><ref name="hodgkin_1952" />  For example, although raising ''V''<sub>''m''</sub>  ''opens'' most gates in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, it also ''closes'' the channel's "inactivation gate", albeit more slowly.<ref name="sodium inactivation">''Purves ''et al.'', pp. 47, 65; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 147<U+2013>148; Stevens, p. 128.</ref>  Hence, when ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> is raised suddenly, the sodium channels open initially, but then close due to the slower inactivation.

The voltages and currents of the action potential in all of its phases were modeled accurately by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] in 1952,<ref name="hodgkin_1952" /> for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1963.<ref name = "Nobel_1963">{{cite press release | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1963 | publisher = The Royal Swedish Academy of Science | date = 1963 | accessdate = 2010-02-21 }}</ref> However, [[Hodgkin<U+2013>Huxley model|their model]] considers only two types of voltage-sensitive ion channels, and makes several assumptions about them, e.g., that their internal gates open and close independently of one another.  In reality, there are many types of ion channels,<ref name="goldin_2007" /> and they do not always open and close independently.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Naundorf B, Wolf F, Volgushev M | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7087/abs/nature04610.html|title=Unique features of action potential initiation in cortical neurons|journal=Nature |volume=440|pages=1060<U+2013>1063 |year=2006|month=April | format = Letter | accessdate=2008-03-27| doi= 10.1038/nature04610|pmid = 16625198|issue = 7087}}</ref>

===Stimulation and rising phase===

A typical action potential begins at the [[axon hillock]]<ref name="axon_hillock_origin">Stevens, p. 49.</ref> with a sufficiently strong depolarization, e.g., a stimulus that increases ''V''<sub>''m''</sub>. This depolarization is often caused by the injection of extra sodium [[cation]]s  into the cell; these cations can come from a wide variety of sources, such as [[chemical synapse]]s, [[sensory neuron]]s or [[pacemaker potential]]s.

The initial membrane permeability to potassium is low, but much higher than that of other ions, making the resting potential close to ''E''<sub>K</sub><U+2248> -75&nbsp;mV.<ref name="resting_potential" /> The depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane, allowing the ions to flow into and out of the axon, respectively.  If the depolarization is small (say, increasing ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> from <U+2212>70&nbsp;mV to <U+2212>60&nbsp;mV), the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal resting potential around <U+2212>70&nbsp;mV.<ref name="failed_initiations" /> However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition ([[positive feedback]]) results: the more inward current there is, the more ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> increases, which in turn further increases the inward current.<ref name="positive_feedback" /> A sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in ''V''<sub>''m''</sub>) causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage ''E''<sub>Na</sub><U+2248> +55&nbsp;mV.  The increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open, which pushes ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> still further towards ''E''<sub>Na</sub>.  This positive feedback continues until the  sodium channels are fully open and ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> is close to ''E''<sub>Na</sub>.<ref name="rising phase">Purves ''et al.'', pp. 49<U+2013>50; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 140<U+2013>141, 150<U+2013>151; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], pp. 480<U+2013>481, 483<U+2013>484; Junge, pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref> The sharp rise in ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> and sodium permeability correspond to the ''rising phase'' of the action potential.<ref name="rising_phase" />

The critical threshold voltage for this runaway condition is usually around <U+2212>45&nbsp;mV, but it depends on the recent activity of the axon.  A membrane that has just fired an action potential cannot fire another one immediately, since the ion channels have not returned to their usual state.  The period during which no new action potential can be fired is called the ''absolute refractory period''.<ref name="refractory" />  At longer times, after some but not all of the ion channels have recovered, the axon can be stimulated to produce another action potential, but only with a much stronger depolarization, e.g., <U+2212>30&nbsp;mV.  The period during which action potentials are unusually difficult to provoke is called the ''relative refractory period''.<ref name="refractory" />

===Peak and falling phase===

The positive feedback of the rising phase slows and comes to a halt as the sodium ion channels become maximally open.  At the peak of the action potential, the sodium permeability is maximized and the membrane voltage ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> is nearly equal to the sodium equilibrium voltage ''E''<sub>Na</sub>.  However, the same raised voltage that opened the sodium channels initially also slowly shuts them off, by closing their pores; the sodium channels become ''inactivated''.<ref name="sodium inactivation" />   This lowers the membrane's permeability to sodium, driving the membrane voltage back down.  At the same time, the raised voltage opens voltage-sensitive potassium channels; the increase in the membrane's potassium permeability drives ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> towards ''E''<sub>K</sub>.<ref name="sodium inactivation" />  Combined, these changes in sodium and potassium permeability cause ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> to drop quickly, repolarizing the membrane and producing the "falling phase" of the action potential.<ref name="repolarization" /><ref name="repolarization">Purves ''et al.'', p. 49; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 147<U+2013>149, 152; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], pp. 483<U+2013>484; Stevens, pp. 126<U+2013>127.</ref>

===Afterhyperpolarization===

The raised voltage opened many more potassium channels than usual, and some of these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. In addition, [[SK channel|further potassium channels]] open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential. The potassium permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> even closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage ''E''<sub>K</sub>. Hence, there is an undershoot or [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]], termed an [[afterhyperpolarization]] in technical language, that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value.<ref name="hyperpolarization">Purves ''et al.'', p. 37; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, and Grinnell, p. 152.</ref>

===Refractory period===

Each action potential is followed by a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], which can be divided into an ''absolute refractory period'', during which it is impossible to evoke another action potential, and then a ''relative refractory period'', during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required.<ref name="refractory">Purves ''et al.'', p. 49; [[Theodore Holmes Bullock|Bullock]], Orkand, Grinell, p. 151; Stevens, pp. 19<U+2013>20; Junge, pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref> These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the state of sodium and potassium channel molecules. When closing after an action potential, sodium channels enter an [[Sodium channel#Gating|"inactivated" state]], in which they cannot be made to open regardless of the membrane potential<U+2014>this gives rise to the absolute refractory period. Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels have transitioned back to their resting state, it frequently happens that a fraction of potassium channels remains open, making it difficult for the membrane potential to depolarize, and thereby giving rise to the relative refractory period. Because the density and subtypes of potassium channels may differ greatly between different types of neurons, the duration of the relative refractory period is highly variable.

The absolute refractory period is largely responsible for the unidirectional propagation of action potentials along axons.<ref name="unidirectional" >Purves ''et al.'', p. 56.</ref> At any given moment, the patch of axon behind the actively spiking part is refractory, but the patch in front, not having been activated recently, is capable of being stimulated by the depolarization from the action potential.

==Propagation==
{{Main|Conduction velocity}}

The action potential generated at the axon hillock propagates as a wave along the axon.<ref>Bullock, Orkland, and Grinnell, pp. 160<U+2013>64.</ref> The currents flowing inwards at a point on the axon during an action potential spread out along the axon, and depolarize the adjacent sections of its membrane. If sufficiently strong, this depolarization provokes a similar action potential at the neighboring membrane patches. This basic mechanism was demonstrated by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] in 1937. After crushing or cooling nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, he showed that an action potential arriving on one side of the block could provoke another action potential on the other, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently short.<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]] | year = 1937 | title = Evidence for electrical transmission in nerve, Part I | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 90 | pages = 183<U+2013>210 | pmid = 16994885 | issue = 2 | pmc = 1395060}}<br />* {{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]] | year = 1937 | title = Evidence for electrical transmission in nerve, Part II | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 90 | pages = 211<U+2013>32 | pmid = 16994886 | issue = 2 | pmc = 1395062}}</ref>

Once an action potential has occurred at a patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again.  At the molecular level, this ''absolute refractory period'' corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e. to return to their closed state.<ref>Stevens, pp. 19<U+2013>20.</ref> There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several millisecond during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels is not returned to their closed state.

===Myelin and saltatory conduction===
{{Main|Myelination|Saltatory conduction}}

The evolutionary need for the fast and efficient transduction of electrical signals in nervous system resulted in appearance of [[myelin]] sheaths around neuronal axons. Myelin is a multilamellar membrane that enwraps the axon in segments separated by intervals known as [[nodes of Ranvier]], is produced by specialized cells, [[Schwann cell]]s exclusively in the [[peripheral nervous system]], and by [[oligodendrocyte]]s exclusively in the [[central nervous system]]. Myelin sheath reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals, thus allowing a fast, saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node.<ref name=Zalc>{{cite journal |author=Zalc B |title=The acquisition of myelin: a success story |journal=Novartis Found.

Not all neurons in vertebrates are myelinated; for example, axons of the neurons comprising autonomous (vegetative) nervous system are not myelinated in general.

Myelin prevents ions from entering or leaving the axon along myelinated segments. As a general rule, myelination increases the [[conduction velocity]] of action potentials and makes them more energy-efficient. Whether saltatory or not, the mean conduction velocity of an action potential ranges from 1&nbsp;m/s to over 100&nbsp;m/s, and generally increases with axonal diameter.<ref name="hursh_1939">{{cite journal | author = Hursh JB | year = 1939 | title = Conduction velocity and diameter of nerve fibers | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume = 127 | pages = 131<U+2013>39}}</ref>

Action potentials cannot propagate through the membrane in myelinated segments of the axon.  However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, which is sufficient to depolarize the next 1 or 2 [[node of Ranvier]].  Instead, the ionic current from an action potential at one [[node of Ranvier]] provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent "hopping" of the action potential from node to node is known as [[saltatory conduction]].

Myelin has two important advantages: fast conduction speed and energy efficiency.  For axons larger than a minimum diameter (roughly 1 [[micrometre]]), myelination increases the [[conduction velocity]] of an action potential, typically tenfold.<ref name="hartline_2007" /> Conversely, for a given conduction velocity, myelinated fibers are smaller than their unmyelinated counterparts.  For example, action potentials move at roughly the same speed (25 m/s) in a myelinated frog axon and an unmyelinated squid giant axon, but the frog axon has a roughly 30-fold smaller diameter and 1000-fold smaller cross-sectional area. Also, since the ionic currents are confined to the nodes of Ranvier, far fewer ions "leak" across the membrane, saving metabolic energy.  This saving is a significant [[natural selection|selective advantage]], since the human nervous system uses approximately 20% of the body's metabolic energy.<ref name="hartline_2007">{{cite journal |author=Hartline DK, Colman DR |title=Rapid conduction and the evolution of giant axons and myelinated fibers |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=R29<U+2013>R35 |year=2007 |pmid=17208176 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.11.042}}</ref>

The length of axons' myelinated segments is important to the success of saltatory conduction. They should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of Ranvier. In nature, myelinated segments are generally long enough for the passively propagated signal to travel for at least two nodes while retaining enough amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node. Thus, the [[safety factor]] of saltatory conduction is high, allowing transmission to bypass nodes in case of injury. However, action potentials may end prematurely in certain places where the safety factor is low, even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the branch point of an axon, where it divides into two axons.<ref>Bullock, Orkland, and Grinnell, p. 163.</ref>

</math>

where ''V(x, t)'' is the voltage across the membrane at a time ''t'' and a position ''x'' along the length of the neuron, and where <U+03BB> and <U+03C4> are the characteristic length and time scales on which those voltages decay in response to a stimulus. Referring to the circuit diagram above, these scales can be determined from the resistances and capacitances per unit length<ref name="space_time_constants" >Purves ''et al.'', pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref>

:<math>
\tau =\ r_{m} c_{m} \,
</math>

:<math>
\lambda = \sqrt \frac{r_m}{r_l}
</math>

These time and length-scales can be used to understand the dependence of the conduction velocity on the diameter of the neuron in unmyelinated fibers. For example, the time-scale <U+03C4> increases with both the membrane resistance ''r''<sub>''m''</sub> and capacitance ''c''<sub>''m''</sub>.  As the capacitance increases, more charge must be transferred to produce a given transmembrane voltage (by [[capacitance|the equation ''Q''=''CV'']]); as the resistance increases, less charge is transferred per unit time, making the equilibration slower.  Similarly, if the internal resistance per unit length ''r''<sub>''i''</sub> is lower in one axon than in another (e.g., because the radius of the former is larger), the spatial decay length <U+03BB> becomes longer and the [[conduction velocity]] of an action potential should increase. If the transmembrane resistance ''r''<sub>''m''</sub> is increased, that lowers the average "leakage" current across the membrane, likewise causing ''<U+03BB>'' to become longer, increasing the conduction velocity.

Given its conservation throughout evolution, the action potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages.  One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110 m/s, which is one-third the [[speed of sound]].  No material object could convey a signal that rapidly throughout the body; for comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8 m/s in large arteries.  Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart.  A second function is the computation associated with its generation.  Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to [[digital electronics]].  The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, one that has been exploited biologically to form [[central pattern generator]]s and mimicked in [[artificial neural network]]s.

[[Image:Loligo vulgaris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The giant axons of the European squid (''[[Loligo vulgaris]]'') were crucial for scientists to understand the action potential.|alt=Photograph of a giant squid.]]

The study of action potentials has required the development of new experimental methods.   The initial work, prior to 1955, focused on three goals: isolating signals from single neurons or axons, developing fast, sensitive electronics, and shrinking [[electrode]]s enough that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded.

The first problem was solved by studying the giant axons found in the neurons of the [[squid]] genus ''[[Loligo]]''.<ref name="keynes_1989">{{cite journal | author = Keynes RD | year = 1989 | title = The role of giant axons in studies of the nerve impulse | journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | pages = 90<U+2013>93|pmid=2541698  | doi = 10.1002/bies.950100213 | issue = 2-3}}</ref>  These axons are so large in diameter (roughly 1&nbsp;mm, or 100-fold larger than a typical neuron) that they can be seen with the naked eye, making them easy to extract and manipulate.<ref name="hodgkin_1952" /><ref name=Meunier>{{cite journal |author=Meunier C, Segev I |title=Playing the devil's advocate: is the Hodgkin-Huxley model useful? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=558<U+2013>63 |year=2002 |pmid=12392930 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02278-6}}</ref>  However, the ''Loligo'' axons are not representative of all excitable cells, and numerous other systems with action potentials have been studied.

The second problem was addressed with the crucial development of the [[voltage clamp]],<ref name="cole_1949">{{cite journal | author = [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|Cole KS]] | year = 1949 | title = Dynamic electrical characteristics of the squid axon membrane | journal = Arch. Sci. Physiol. | volume = 3 | pages = 253<U+2013>8}}</ref> which permitted experimenters to study the ionic currents underlying an action potential in isolation, and eliminated a key source of [[electronic noise]], the current ''I''<sub>''C''</sub>  associated with the [[capacitance]] ''C'' of the membrane.<ref name="junge_63_82">Junge, pp. 63<U+2013>82.</ref>  Since the current equals ''C'' times the rate of change of the transmembrane voltage ''V''<sub>''m''</sub>, the solution was to design a circuit that kept ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> fixed (zero rate of change) regardless of the currents flowing across the membrane.  Thus, the current required to keep ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> at a fixed value is a direct reflection of the current flowing through the membrane. Other electronic advances included the use of [[Faraday cage]]s and electronics with high [[input impedance]], so that the  measurement itself did not affect the voltage being measured.<ref name="kettenmann_1992">{{cite book | author = Kettenmann H, Grantyn R | year = 1992 | title = Practical Electrophysiological Methods | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | isbn = 978-0471562009}}</ref>

While glass micropipette electrodes measure the sum of the currents passing through many ion channels, studying the electrical properties of a single ion channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the [[patch clamp]] by [[Erwin Neher]] and [[Bert Sakmann]].

==Neurotoxins==

[[Image:Puffer Fish DSC01257.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tetrodotoxin]] is a lethal toxin found in [[pufferfish]] that inhibits the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive sodium channel]], halting action potentials.|alt=Photograph of a pufferfish.]]

Several [[neurotoxin]]s, both natural and synthetic, are designed to block the action potential.  [[Tetrodotoxin]] from the [[pufferfish]] and [[saxitoxin]] from the ''[[Gonyaulax]]'' (the [[dinoflagellate]] genus responsible for "[[Paralytic shellfish poisoning|red tide]]s")  block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel;<ref name="TTX_refs">{{cite journal | author = Nakamura Y, Nakajima S, Grundfest H | year = 1965 | title = The effect of tetrodotoxin on electrogenic components of squid giant axons | journal = J.

Such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose, by allowing scientists to "turn off" specific channels at will, thus isolating  the other channels' contributions; they can also be useful in purifying ion channels by [[affinity chromatography]] or in assaying their concentration. However, such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins, and have been considered for use as [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]]s.  Neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective [[insecticide]]s; one example is the synthetic [[permethrin]], which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials.  The ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans.  Many other neurotoxins interfere with the transmission of the action potential's effects at the [[chemical synapse|synapses]], especially at the [[neuromuscular junction]].

The role of electricity in the nervous systems of animals was first observed in dissected [[frog]]s by [[Luigi Galvani]], who studied it from 1791 to 1797.<ref name="piccolino_1997">{{cite journal | author = Piccolino M | year = 1997 | title = Luigi Galvani and animal electricity: two centuries after the foundation of electrophysiology | journal = Trends in Neuroscience | volume = 20 | pages = 443<U+2013>448 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01101-6}}</ref> Galvani's results stimulated [[Alessandro Volta]] to develop the [[Voltaic pile]] <U+2014> the earliest-known [[battery (electricity)|electric battery]] <U+2014> with which he studied animal electricity (such as [[electric eel]]s) and the physiological responses to applied [[direct current|direct-current]] [[voltage]]s.<ref name="piccolino_2000">{{cite journal | author = Piccolino M | year = 2000 | title = The bicentennial of the Voltaic battery (1800<U+2013>2000): the artificial electric organ | journal = Trends in Neuroscience | volume = 23 | pages = 147<U+2013>151 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01544-1}}</ref>

Scientists of the 19th century studied the propagation of electrical signals in whole [[nerve]]s (i.e., bundles of [[neuron]]s) and demonstrated that nervous tissue was made up of [[cell (biology)|cells]], instead of an interconnected network of tubes (a ''reticulum'').<ref name="history">{{cite book | author = Brazier MAB | year = 1961 | title = A History of the Electrical Activity of the Brain | publisher = Pitman | location = London}}<br />* {{cite book | author = McHenry LC | year = 1969 | title = Garrison's History of Neurology | publisher = Charles C. Thomas | location = Springfield, IL}}<br />* {{cite book | author = Swazey J, Worden FG | year = 1975 | title = Paths of Discovery in the Neurosciences | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA}}</ref>  [[Carlo Matteucci]] followed up Galvani's studies and demonstrated that [[cell membrane]]s had a voltage across them and could produce [[direct current]].  Matteucci's work inspired the German physiologist, [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], who discovered the action potential in 1848.  The [[conduction velocity]] of action potentials was first measured in 1850 by du Bois-Reymond's friend, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].  To establish that nervous tissue was made up of discrete cells, the Spanish physician [[Santiago Ram<U+00F3>n y Cajal]] and his students used a stain developed by [[Camillo Golgi]] to reveal the myriad shapes of neurons, which they rendered painstakingly.  For their discoveries, Golgi and Ram<U+00F3>n y Cajal were awarded the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Physiology]].<ref name = "Nobel_1906">{{cite press release | url = http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1906/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906 | publisher = The Royal Swedish Academy of Science | date = 1906 | accessdate = 2010-02-21 }}</ref> Their work resolved a long-standing controversy in the [[neuroanatomy]] of the 19th century; Golgi himself had argued for the network model of the nervous system.

The 20th century was a golden era for electrophysiology. In 1902 and again in 1912, [[Julius Bernstein]] advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the [[permeation|permeability]] of the axonal membrane to ions.<ref name="bernstein_1902_1912">{{cite journal | author = [[Julius Bernstein|Bernstein J]] | year = 1902 | title = Untersuchungen zur Thermodynamik der bioelektrischen Str<U+00F6>me | journal = Pfl<U+00FC>ger's Arch.

''I''<sub>''m''</sub> and ''V''<sub>''m''</sub> represent the current through, and the voltage across, a small patch of membrane, respectively. The ''C''<sub>''m''</sub> represents the capacitance of the membrane patch, whereas the four ''g'''s represent the [[electrical conductance|conductances]] of four types of ions. The two conductances on the left, for potassium (K) and sodium (Na), are shown with arrows to indicate that they can vary with the applied voltage, corresponding to the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive ion channels]]. The two conductances on the right help determine the [[resting membrane potential]].|alt=Circuit diagram depicting five parallel circuits that are interconnected at the top to the extracellular solution and at the bottom to the intracellular solution.]]

Mathematical and computational models are essential for understanding the action potential, and offer predictions  that may be tested against experimental data, providing a stringent test of a theory.  The most important and accurate of these models is the [[Hodgkin<U+2013>Huxley model]], which describes the action potential by a coupled set of four [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs).<ref name="hodgkin_1952" /> Although the Hodgkin<U+2013>Huxley model may be a simplification of a realistic nervous membrane as it exists in nature, its complexity has inspired several even-more-simplified models,<ref>{{cite book | author = Hoppensteadt FC | year = 1986 | title = An introduction to the mathematics of neurons | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-31574-3}}<br />* {{cite journal | author = FitzHugh R | year = 1960 | title = Thresholds and plateaus in the Hodgkin-Huxley nerve equations | journal = J.
