The '''Arc de Ber<U+00E0>''' (sometimes written Bar<U+00E0>) is a [[triumphal arch]] some 20 km north of the city of [[Tarragona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], close to [[Roda de Bar<U+00E0>]]. It stands on the line of what was the [[Via Augusta]], now the N-340 road.<ref>http://www.mnat.es/cat/tarraco/monu/monu02.html</ref>

Its name derives from the [[Bera, Count of Barcelona|count Ber<U+00E0>]]. It is a triumphal arch with a single opening consisting of a central body on a podium, decorated with fluted pilasters crowned by Corinthian capitals.<ref>http://www.tinet.cat/~jta/tarraco.html</ref> The upper part of the construction is an [[entablature]] made up of [[architrave]], [[frieze]] and [[cornice]]. The stone used is probably from a local quarry.

The monument was built as a result of the will of Lucius Licinius Sura and it was erected in the reign of [[Augustus]], around 13 BCE. The surviving inscription reads: <U+201C>Ex testamento L(uci) Licini L(uci) f(ilii) Serg(ia tribu) Surae consa[...]<U+201D>. It is thought it was dedicated to Augustus or to his genius, and that it marked the limit of the district of [[Tarraco]].
