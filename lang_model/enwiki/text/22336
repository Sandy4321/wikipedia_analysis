'''''Perfectionist''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by English recording artist [[Natalia Kills]]. It was released on 15 March 2011 through [[will.i.am Music Group]], [[Cherrytree Records]], [[Konvict Musik|Kon Live]] and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]. Despite having started an acting career, Kills ventured into rap and released a single in 2005; however, her label went bankrupt. Kills continued working as a songwriter until 2008, when she was signed by will.i.am and started recording for the album. 

Kills worked with musicians including [[Fernando Garibay]], [[Jeff Bhasker]] and [[Martin Kierszenbaum]], and created a [[concept album]] based on [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]. Its lyrical content contains references to love, sex, and money while its sound is mostly styled in [[synthpop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]]. ''Perfectionist'' received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who criticized its music and preferred Kills' visual projects. The album performed moderately on international [[record chart]]s, obtaining top 50 positions in some European countries. In the United States, it reached number 129, and has sold 14,000 copies there as of September 2013; in the United Kingdom, it peaked at number 134.

The album spawned three singles<U+2014>"[[Mirrors (Natalia Kills song)|Mirrors]]", "[[Wonderland (Natalia Kills song)|Wonderland]]" and "[[Free (Natalia Kills song)|Free]]"<U+2014>which attained success in Europe and were accompanied by [[music video]]s. "Mirrors" managed to peak within the top 5 of the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]]. In association with Guillaume Doubet, Kills also produced a [[web series]] titled ''Love, Kills xx'', based on her secret thoughts and desires. Comprised of 10 episodes, it sees Kills seeking revenge and hurting men.

[[File:Will.i.am in 2012.jpg|thumb|left|[[will.i.am]], ''Perfectionist''{{'}}s co-executive producer, signed Kills in November 2008|alt=will.i.am posing for photographers]]
Kills was introduced to singing and dancing at the age of 3, and until she was 12, she studied in the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]]. Kills initially pursued an acting career, appearing in some TV series including ''[[All About Me]]'' and ''[[The Archers]]'', however, in her hometown of Leeds, she developed an interest in [[hip hop music]]. She subsequently entered various rap battles, for which she started writing lyrics, and in 2003, Kills won a [[BBC Radio 1]]-sponsored "[[Master of ceremonies|MC]] Battle". From there on, she began writing songs for artists and film soundtracks.<ref name=argus>{{cite news|work=[[Telegraph & Argus]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|date=7 April 2006|author=Clayton, Emma|title=Natalia's rapping delight|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/leisure/tamusic/urbanmusic/urbanfeatures/727382.Natalia_s_rapping_delight/}}</ref> Kills released her first single on 21 February 2005, titled "[[Don't Play Nice]]", under the moniker Verbalicious and with label [[All Around the World Productions|All Around the World]]; it peaked at number 11 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (GB).

One of Kills' [[Demo (music)|demo]]s, "Shopaholic", was remixed by the [[Remix Artist Collective]]. After it was posted in American blogger [[Perez Hilton]]'s blog, Kills' MySpace received a high amount of views, and she reached the top of the social network's unsigned artists chart.<ref name=billboard1/> One day, while shopping, she gave her website address to a man who noticed her clothing; he subsequently introduced her to a DJ, who took Kills to the American musician [[will.i.am]]'s house.

==Recording==

Kills started to prepare material for ''Perfectionist'' soon after establishing her record deal with will.i.am, who served as an executive producer for the album.<ref name=vogue/> During the recording sessions, Kills worked with four prominent [[Production (music)|producers]]<U+2014>[[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Fernando Garibay]], the album's second executive producer [[Martin Kierszenbaum]], and [[Theron Feemster|Theron "The-Ron" Feemster]]. [[Akon]] and Giorgio Tuinfort co-produced "Mirrors" in collaboration with Kierszenbaum. Bhasker handled the songwriting and engineering, and mixed "Zombie". Feemster and Tuinfort provided instrumentation, along with Zach Kasik, Carlos Keery-Fisher and Robert Horn. More artists including Robert Horn and Tony Ugyal were commissioned for engineering.<ref name="notes">{{cite AV media notes|title=Perfectionist|artist=[[Natalia Kills]]|year=2011|type=[[Compact Disc]]|publisher=[[Cherrytree Records|Cherrytree]]; [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]}}</ref><ref name=billboard1/>

Most of ''Perfectionist''{{'}}s songs were recorded at either Cherrytree Recording Studios or Enormous Studios; the latter served as the recording place for songs produced by Bhasker. "Break You Hard" and "Superficial" were produced at the American Dream, while [[Wonderland (Natalia Kills song)|Wonderland]]" was produced at that studio and at [[The Hive (studio)|The Hive]]. Kills recorded "Love Is a Suicide" and "Broke" at Paradise Studios, "[[Mirrors (Natalia Kills song)|Mirrors]]" at [[Chalice Recording Studios]], and "If I Was God" at The Boom Boom Room.<ref name="billboard1"/>

Kills described working with will.i.am, "[...] it's almost difficult having a normal conversation with him because he's firing out ideas all the time. [...] His entire life revolves around creativity, and that's something I could really relate to."<ref name=rhapsody>{{cite web|publisher=[[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|title=Rhapsody Radar Interview: Natalia Kills|url=http://secure.rhapsody.com/blog/post/rhapsody-radar-natalia-kills-interview|author=1 July 2011|author=Devitt, Rachel}}</ref> Kierszenbaum praised Kills' work ethic during the recording sessions, stating that she would focus simultaneously on the melodic and lyrical structure of song, as well as its [[soundscape]]. He went on to say that she "influenced the timbre of the sound" and assisted the production as if "she's making a movie." <ref name=billboard1/>

To promote the album, a [[web series]] titled ''Love, Kills xx'' was written, produced and directed by Kills and Guillaume Doubet. The episodes feature the fomer as their protagonist; Akon, [[Far East Movement]] and [[Colette Carr]] appear as guests. According to Kills, the series are mostly devoid of dialogue in order to center on "emotion and action". She also said that the visuals were an "expression" of her secret thoughts, regrets and desires. Each episode contains an instrumental of a song from ''Perfectionist'', and most videos contain narration from Kills.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[MSN#MSN.com|MSN Canada]].

Upon release, ''Perfectionist'' received polarized reviews from [[music critics]]. Jon O'Brien from [[AllMusic]] summarized it as "formulaic and gimmicky", and observed that the music was secondary to Kills' attempts of establishing a mature image.<ref name=allmusic/> [[AltSounds]] staff member Jack Stevin deemed it "dissapointing" and unfocused, writing that Kills was not in control of the album and that she had an "air of pretension around" her. Stevin additionally said that Kills was stronger as a "visual artist".<ref name=altsounds/> Writing for [[Consequence of Sound]], Alex Young noted that Kills expressed herself better as a musician through music videos, and surmised that "not all the songs on ''Perfectionist'' hit their mark".<ref name="cos"/> [[Digital Spy]]'s Lewis Corner described it as "finely tailored" and "exciting", and gave it four stars out of five.<ref name=digitalspy/> [[musicOMH]] writer Blair Kelly characterised the album as imperfect, "uninspired, unoriginal and obvious" while negatively comparing it to the works of American artist [[Lady Gaga]].<ref name=musicomh/>

In Europe, the album achieved moderate chart success. On the chart issue dated 1 October 2011, it entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 129.<ref name="IQ Ware Ltd">{{cite journal |title=The Official UK Albums Chart for the week ending 1 October 2011 |journal=[[UKChartsPlus|ChartsPlus]] |publisher=IQ Ware |issue=527}}</ref> In Austria and Canada, the album respectively reached number 35 and 36, while in the German and Swiss album charts, it peaked at number 50 and 94.<ref name="austriachart"/><ref name=canadaone/><ref name=switzerlandchart/> ''Perfectionist'' managed to top the US [[Heatseekers Albums]] and reach number 6 of the [[Dance/Electronic Albums]], despite entering the main [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at number 134.<ref name=heatseekers/><ref name=dance/><ref name=usachart/> In Canada, the album reached number 36.<ref name=canadaone/> Kills credited the success of the album and its singles with changing her life, commenting, "I had nowhere to live, [...] got on a plane to LA and then two years later I had sold over 800,000 singles. I wrote 14 songs and that's what happened? [...] I would never have thought this. I would have probably thought I was dead by now."<ref name=dsa>{{cite web|publisher=Digital Spy.

Kills discussed ''Perfectionist'' during 2013 interviews. She revealed that after having lived a deplorable life in London, her ambitions and dreams influenced the album's lyrics. "I was not as aware of... how I was", she stated. "I almost had a bit of fear where everybody wants to be loved, everybody wants to be understood in a way that<U+2019>s not full of judgment or blame. So I put all of myself into the album and then [kept] bits out."<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|author=Lipshutz, Jason|title=Natalia Kills Gets Real on 'Trouble' Album: 'I Wanted To Confront Who I Am Head-On'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5645279/natalia-kills-gets-real-on-trouble-album-i-wanted-to-confront-who|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=22 December 2013|date=8 August 2013}}</ref> That year, Corner hailed ''Perfectionist'' as "one of the most underrated pop collections in recent memory", and Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that although it had "killer" choruses, the album suffered from excessive similiarities to other artists.<ref name="dsa"/><ref name="idolator3">{{cite web|author=Lansky, Sam|title=Natalia Kills' 'Trouble': Album Review|url=http://www.idolator.com/7481558/natalia-kills-trouble-review|publisher=Idolator.
