The '''Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart''', often called the [[Saint Joseph|Josephites]] ("Brown Joeys"), were founded in [[Penola, South Australia|Penola]], [[South Australia]] in 1866 by [[Mary MacKillop]] and Father [[Julian Tenison Woods]].

The centre of the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] is at Mary MacKillop Place, Mount Street, North [[Sydney]] where Saint Mary MacKillop's tomb is enshrined in the Mary MacKillop Memorial Chapel.

At present there are around 850 sisters living and working throughout [[Australia]] ([[South Australia]], [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]) and [[New Zealand]], as well as [[Ireland]] and [[Peru]].

The sisters have "Mary MacKillop Centres" at Penola, South Australia; Kensington, South Australia; East Melbourne, Victoria; Annerley, Queensland; South Perth, Western Australia - and the main centre mentioned above - at North Sydney.  The Australian-New Zealand Federation of the Sisters of St Joseph includes convents in Goulburn and Lochinvar in New South Wales.<ref>Details on the ''Josephite Calendar'' for 2009</ref>

==History==
===Founding of school and religious institute===
[[File:Mary MacKillop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Saint Mary MacKillop]].]]

Father Julian Tenison Woods had been very concerned about the lack of education and particularly Catholic education in [[South Australia]].<ref name="BioBeginnings">{{Citation | title = Mary's Story: Beginnings | url = http://www.marymackillop.org.au/marys-story/beginnings.cfm | accessdate = 25 September 2010}}</ref> In 1866, he invited MacKillop and her sisters Annie and Lexie to come to Penola and open a Catholic school.<ref name="BioBeginnings" /> Woods was appointed director of education and became the founder, along with MacKillop, of a school they opened in a stable there. After renovations by their brother, the MacKillops started teaching more than fifty children.<ref name=ewtn>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/new_evangelization/oceania/holiness/saints1.htm |title=Blessed Mary of the Cross| accessdate=20 October 2008}}</ref><ref name="BioGrowth">{{Cite web |title=Mary's Story: Growth |url=http://www.marymackillop.org.au/marys-story/growth.cfm |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> At this time MacKillop made a declaration of her dedication to God and began wearing black.<ref name="Vermeer">"In Her Own Hand", [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|''The Advertiser'']], pp. 8, 89; 17&nbsp;October 2010</ref>

In 1867, MacKillop became the first sister and [[Abbess|mother superior]] of the newly formed institute of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart,<ref name="BioBeginnings" /> and moved to the new convent in Grote Street, [[Adelaide]]. In the same year, at age 25, she adopted the religious name Sister Mary of the [[Feast of the Cross|Cross]]. In Adelaide they founded a new school at the request of the bishop, [[Laurence Bonaventure Sheil]].<ref name=sosjms>[http://www.sosj.org.au/mary/mary.html Saint Mary MacKillop], accessed 20 October 2008</ref> Dedicated to the education of the children of the poor, it was the first [[religious institute]] to be founded by an Australian. The rules developed by Father Woods and MacKillop for the convent emphasised poverty, a dependence on divine providence, no ownership of personal belongings, faith that God would provide and willingness to go where needed.<ref name="BioBeginnings" /> The rules were approved by Bishop Sheil. By the end of 1867, ten other nuns had joined the Josephites<ref name="BioBeginnings" /> who had adopted a plain brown [[Religious habit|habit]]. The Josephite nuns became colloquially known as the Brown [[Joey (marsupial)|Joeys]].<ref name="Vermeer"/>

===Expansion of the Josephites===
[[File:NthSydneyBuilding0006.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary MacKillop Chapel in [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]], which holds MacKillop's tomb]]

In an attempt to provide education to all the poor, particularly in country areas, a school was opened at [[Yankalilla, South Australia]] in October 1867. By the end of 1869, more than 70 Josephite nuns were educating children at 21 schools in Adelaide and the country. MacKillop and her Josephites were also involved with an [[orphanage]]; neglected children; girls in danger; the aged poor; a reformatory (in Johnstown near Kapunda); a home for the aged; and incurably ill.<ref name=MMKSum>[http://www.sosj.org.au/mary/documents/MaryMacKillopsummarydocumentreworked71107.pdf Mary MacKillop], accessed 20&nbsp;October 2008 {{Wayback | url=http://www.sosj.org.au/mary/documents/MaryMacKillopsummarydocumentreworked71107.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | date=20080722071816 }}</ref>

In December 1869, MacKillop and several other nuns travelled to Brisbane to establish the institute in [[Queensland]].<ref name="BioGrowth" /> They were based at [[Kangaroo Point, Queensland|Kangaroo Point]] and took the ferry or rowed across the [[Brisbane River]] to attend Mass at old [[The Cathedral of St Stephen, Brisbane|St Stephen's Cathedral]]. Two years later, she was in [[Port Augusta, South Australia]] for the same purpose. The Josephite Congregation expanded rapidly and, by 1871, 130 nuns were working in more than 40 schools and charitable institutions across South Australia and Queensland.<ref name=MMKSum />

After the acquisition of the Mother House at Kensington in 1872, MacKillop made preparations to leave for Rome to have the rules of the Sisters of St Joseph officially approved.

MacKillop travelled to Rome in 1873 to seek papal approval for the [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] and was encouraged in her work by [[Pope Pius&nbsp;IX]].<ref name=ewtn /> The authorities in Rome made changes to the way Josephites lived in poverty,<ref name=MMKSum /> declared that the Superior General and her council were the authorities in charge of the institute,<ref name="BioChallenge">{{Citation | title = Mary's Story: Challenge | url = http://www.marymackillop.org.au/marys-story/challenge.cfm | accessdate = 25 September 2010}}</ref> and assured MacKillop that the congregation and their rule of life would receive final approval after a trial period.<ref name=ewtn /> The resulting alterations to the rule of life {{Specify|date=February 2010}} caused a breach between MacKillop and Father Woods, who felt that the revised rule compromised the ideal of vowed poverty, and blamed MacKillop for not getting the rule accepted in its original form.<ref name="BioChallenge" /><ref name="ADB">[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050199b.htm MacKillop, Mary Helen (1842<U+2013>1909) Biographical Entry], accessed 21&nbsp;October 2008</ref> Before Woods' death on 7&nbsp;October 1889, he and MacKillop were personally reconciled, but he did not renew his involvement with her institute.<ref name="BioChallenge" /> The Sisters split, with Fr Woods branch becoming known as the Black Josephites, for their black habits, while Mary MacKillop's sisters donned brown habits and where thus known as the Brown Josephites.

While in Europe, MacKillop travelled widely to observe educational methods.<ref name=ADB />

During this period, the Josephites expanded their operations into [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand. MacKillop relocated to Sydney in 1883 on the instruction of [[Christopher Augustine Reynolds|Bishop Reynolds]] of Adelaide.<ref name=MMKSum /> When she returned in January 1875, after an absence of nearly two years, she brought approval from Rome for her nuns and the work they did, materials for her school, books for the convent library, several priests and most of all, 15 new Josephites from [[Ireland]]. Regardless of her success, she still had to contend with the opposition of priests and several bishops. This did not change after her unanimous election as [[Superior General]] in March 1875.<ref name="BioChallenge" />

The Josephites were unique among Catholic church ministries in two ways. Firstly, the nuns lived in the community rather than in convents. Secondly the institute's constitution required administration by a Superior General rather than a diocese headed by the bishop, a structure that remains unique today. This structure resulted in the institute being forced to leave [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in 1876 and [[Queensland]] by 1880 due to their respective bishop's refusal to accept this administrative structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE4183b.htm |title=Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart |work=The Australian Women's Register |publisher=National Foundation for Australian Women and the [[University of Melbourne]] |accessdate=19 October 2010 |first=Nikki |last=Henningham |date=5 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marymackillop.org.au/timeline/timeline.cfm?loadref=1 |title=Timeline, Moments in the Life of Saint Mary Mackillop |work=Saint Mary MacKillop |publisher=Sisters of Saint Joseph |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref>

Notwithstanding all the trouble, the institute did expand. By 1877, it operated more than 40 schools in and around Adelaide, with many others in Queensland and New South Wales. With the help from Benson, Barr Smith, the Baker family, [[Emmanuel Solomon]] and other non-Catholics, the Josephites, with MacKillop as their leader and superior-general, were able to continue the religious and other good works, including visiting prisoners in jail.

After the death of Sydney's Archbishop Vaughan in 1883, [[Patrick Francis Moran]] became archbishop. Although he had a somewhat positive outlook toward the Josephites, he removed MacKillop as Mother General and replaced her with Sister Bernard Walsh.<ref name=ewtn /><ref name=MMKSum /><ref name="BioChallenge" />

[[Pope Leo XIII]] made the Josephites into a canonical Congregation in 1885, with its headquarters in Sydney.<ref name="BioChallenge" /> He gave the final approval to the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart in 1888.<ref name=ewtn />

Although still living through [[alms]], the Josephite nuns had been very successful. In South Australia, they had schools in many country towns including, [[Willunga]], [[Willochra]], [[Whyte Yarcowie, South Australia|Yarcowie]], [[Mintaro]], [[Auburn, South Australia|Auburn]], [[Jamestown, South Australia|Jamestown]], [[Laura, South Australia|Laura]], [[Sevenhill]], [[Quorn, South Australia|Quorn]], [[Spalding, South Australia|Spalding]], [[Georgetown, South Australia|Georgetown]], [[Robe, South Australia|Robe]], [[Pekina]], Appila and several others. MacKillop continued her work for the Josephites in Sydney and tried to provide as much support as possible for those in South Australia. In 1883 the institute was successfully established at [[Temuka]] in [[New Zealand]], where MacKillop stayed for over a year.<ref name="MMNZ">Owens, S. "[http://www.maristmessenger.co.nz/?p=1235 Mary McKillop in New Zealand]", ''Marist Messenger NZ'', 1 October 2010. Retrieved 4 December 2010.</ref> In 1889 it was also established in the Australian state of Victoria.

During all these years MacKillop assisted Mother Bernard with the management of the Sisters of St Joseph. She wrote letters of support, advice and encouragement or just to keep in touch. By 1896, MacKillop was back in South Australia visiting fellow nuns in [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]], Pekina, [[Kapunda]], [[Jamestown, South Australia|Jamestown]] and [[Gladstone, South Australia|Gladstone]]. That same year, she travelled again to New Zealand, spending several months in [[Port Chalmers]] and [[Arrowtown]] in [[Otago]].<ref name="MMNZ"/><ref name="NZ_Herald_10680874">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10680874 |title=A blessing on both sides |author=Gilchrist, Shane |date=16 October 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> During her time in New Zealand the Sisters of St Joseph a school were established in the [[South Island]]. In 1897, Bishop Maher of Port Augusta arranged for the Sisters of St Joseph to take charge of the St Anacletus Catholic Day School at Petersburg (now [[Peterborough, South Australia|Peterborough]]).

MacKillop founded a convent and base for the Sisters of St Joseph in Petersburg on 16 January 1897. "On January&nbsp;16th, 1897, the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Mother Mary of the Cross,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050199b.htm |title=Mother Mary of the Cross}}</ref> arrived in Petersburg to take over the school. She was accompanied by Sister Benizi (who was placed in charge of the school), Sister M. Joseph, Sister Clotilde and Sister Aloysius Joseph. They were met at the station by Rev. Father Norton who took them to the newly blessed convent, purchased for them on Railway Terrace."<ref name="40RailwayTerrace">{{cite book |title=The Catholic Story, of Peterborough |publisher=Peterborough Centenary Committee |year=1976}} cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.sosj.org.au/news-events/view_article.cfm?id=113&loadref=7 |title=Mary MacKillop Lane, Peterborough, South Australia |work=Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart website |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref> The property at 40 Railway Terrace is identified as the convent by a plaque placed by the Catholic diocese of Peterborough.<ref name="40RailwayTerrace"/>

After the death of Mother Bernard, MacKillop was once more elected unopposed as Mother Superior-General in 1899,<ref name=ewtn /><ref name=MMKSum /> a position she held until her own death. During the later years of her life she had many problems with her health which continued to deteriorate. She suffered from [[rheumatism]] and after a [[stroke]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand in 1902, became paralysed on her right side. For seven years, she had to rely on a wheelchair to move around, but her speech and mind were as good as ever and her letter writing had continued unabated after she learned to write with her left hand. Even after suffering the stroke, the Josephite nuns had enough confidence in her to re-elect her in 1905.

MacKillop died on 8 August 1909 in the Josephite convent in [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]].<ref name=sosjms /> The Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Moran, stated that: "I consider this day to have assisted at the deathbed of a Saint."<ref name="Vermeer" /> She was laid to rest at the [[Gore Hill, New South Wales|Gore Hill]] cemetery, a few kilometres up the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]] from North Sydney. After MacKillop's burial, people continually took earth from around her grave. As a result, her remains were [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and transferred on 27 January 1914 to a [[Burial vault (tomb)|vault]] before the [[altar]] of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the newly built memorial chapel in Mount Street, Sydney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marymackillopplace.org.au/chapel/index.asp |title=www.marymackillopplace.org.au/chapel |publisher=Marymackillopplace.org.au |date= |accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref> The vault was a gift of Joanna Barr Smith, a lifelong friend and admiring [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]].

===After Mary McKillop===

The wide network of schools and community aid organisations established by the Sisters continued to expand throughout Australasia and elsewhere during the 20th Century. While vocations within Australia suffered along with other religious institutes in the latter 20th century, its work continued and global recognition came with the canonisation of Mary McKillop in 2010.

Since 1979 the [[Congregations of St Joseph]], made up of all the Sisters of St Joseph and Associates throughout the world, have had a presence at the United Nations as an NGO (Non - Governmental Organisation). In 1999 the Congregations of St Joseph gained accreditation with the Economic and Social Council at the United Nations, allowing them access to other UN programs and agencies. As an NGO its focus is poverty, empowering women and children, ecology, environment and immigrants.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/what-we-are-doing/index.cfm?loadref=151</ref>

The number of sisters teaching in schools and vocations in general have declined in Australia, however community work has continued, with the foundation of organisations like [[Josephite Community Aid]] in 1986 designed to  support young lay people getting involved in community work with refugees and others and a range of other volunteer programs. Mary MacKillop Centres were established as focal points for pilgrimage, learning and spirituality.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/being-involved/index.cfm?loadref=70#mmcentre</ref>

By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Josephites reported around 850 sisters involved in ministering throughout Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Peru, East Timor, Scotland and Brazil.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/who-we-are/index.cfm?loadref=14</ref> The sisters maintained an interest in working in education, aged care, ministry in rural areas, work with indigenous Australians, refugees, families, the homeless,  and general pastoral and parish ministries.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/what-we-are-doing/index.cfm?loadref=3</ref> The South Australian Province Reconciliation Circle, comprising a group of Josephite and Carmelite women together with Aboriginal mentors, began meeting regularly in 2003 to work for justice and reconciliation in indigenous affairs.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/what-we-are-doing/index.cfm?loadref=149</ref> In 2006 the Conference of Josephite Leaders (Central and Federation Congregations) established the Josephite Leaders Social Action Office, now known as the Josephite Justice Office, to conduct advocacy in the community.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/what-we-are-doing/index.cfm?loadref=147</ref> Outside Australia, the sisters were involved in dducation in East Timor, health care and poverty reduction in Peru, and community support programs in Brazil.<ref>http://www.sosj.org.au/what-we-are-doing/index.cfm?loadref=150</ref>

===Canonisation of Mary MacKillop===

In 1925, the Mother Superior of the Sisters of St Joseph, Mother Laurence, began the process to have MacKillop declared a saint and [[Michael Kelly (bishop)|Michael Kelly]], Archbishop of Sydney, established a tribunal to carry the process forward. After further investigations, MacKillop's "[[heroic virtue]]" was declared in 1992.  Her [[canonisation]] was announced on 19&nbsp;February 2010 and subsequently took place on 17&nbsp;October 2010.<ref name="ABC2010-02-19">{{Cite news| date = 19 February 2010 | title = Date set for MacKillop's sainthood | work = ABC News | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/19/2825313.htm | accessdate = 19 February 2010 }}</ref> This made her the first Australian saint.<ref name="Winfield">{{Cite news |url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9CMFJF02|title=John Paul&nbsp;II moves a step closer to beatification|last=Winfield|first=Nichole|date=19 December 2009|agency = [[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Andrew Breitbart|Breitbart]]|accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref> An estimated 8,000 Australians were present in [[Vatican City]] to witness the ceremony.<ref name="ABC-Pilgrims">{{cite web |last=Alberici |first=Emma |title=Australians celebrate Mary's canonisation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/18/3040655.htm |publisher=ABC News |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref>
