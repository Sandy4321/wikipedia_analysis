'''SMS ''Bremse''''' was a [[Brummer class cruiser|''Brummer''-class]] [[minelayer|minelaying]] [[light cruiser]] of the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiserliche Marine]].  She was built by [[AG Vulcan Stettin]] and launched on 11 March 1916 at [[Stettin]], [[Germany]], the second of the two-ship class after her [[Sister ship|sister]], {{SMS|Brummer}}. She served during the [[First World War]], operating for most of the time in company with her sister. The two sisters took part in an ambush on a convoy in the [[North Sea]], where they sank two destroyers in a surprise attack, before hunting down and sinking nine merchants, after which they returned to port unscathed.

''Bremse'' was one of the ships interned at [[Scapa Flow]] under the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany|armistice]] in November 1918, and was [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled]] there with many of the ships of the German fleet on 21 June 1919. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for [[Ernest Cox]], though they had to contend with large quantities of oil and the risks of fires and explosions. Having been brought back to the surface after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.

==Design==
The ''Brummer'' class were designed as fast offensive minelayers, and to facilitate their operations in British waters, they were designed to resemble the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Arethusa class cruiser (1913)|''Arethusa''-class]] cruisers, with a distinct curvature to their bows, three slender funnels of equal height, and masts crossed in the British style.<ref name=Cruisers>{{cite book | last = Ireland| title = The Illustrated Guide to Cruisers| page = 172}}</ref> The mainmast could also be quickly struck, to add to the deception. They could carry 400 [[naval mine|mines]], but were liable to be difficult to handle when fully loaded.<ref name=Cruisers/> ''Bremse'' was named after a 1884 gunboat, with ''Bremse'' itself being the [[German language|German]] for a type of small insect.<ref name=Bremse/>

==Career== 
''Bremse'' was commissioned on 1 July 1916 and entered service with her sister, with whom she would serve for most of the war.<ref name=Bremse>{{cite web|url=http://german-navy.de/hochseeflotte/ships/smallcruiser/bremse/index.html |title=Bremse Ship Info |publisher=german-navy.de |accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=ww1>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/cruisers/sms-brummer.html|title=Brummer Class Minelaying Cruisers|publisher=worldwar1.co.uk |accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref> In October 1916 ''Bremse'' and her sister were assigned to the II Scouting Group, then to the IV Scouting Group in December 1916.<ref name=ww1/>  

===Convoy ambush===
Britain had agreed to ship 250,000 tons of coal a month to Norway, and a regular stream of convoys carrying shipments of coal was crossing the North Sea by late 1917, usually escorted by a couple of destroyers and some [[armed trawler]]s.<ref name="COS">{{cite book |last=Massie|title=Castle's of Steel|page=747}}</ref> Attempts to interdict them with [[U-boat]]s had so far been ineffective, so Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] decided to deploy a surface force to carry out a surprise attack. The convoys passed between 300 and 350 miles from the German anchorage at [[Horns Rev|Horn Reefs]], a distance that could be covered in 14 hours by ships steaming at over {{convert|30|kn|km/h}}.<ref name="COS"/> As winter approached, the poor light decreased the chances of raiders being detected, and Scheer decided to assign ''Bremse'' and ''Brummer'', both capable of a maximum speed of  {{convert|34|kn|km/h}} to carry out the ambush.<ref name="COS"/> 
[[File:SMS Brummer.jpg|thumb|left|''Bremse''{{'}}s sister, {{SMS|Brummer}}]]
On 17 October 1917 the target was a westbound Scandinavian convoy consisting of ten merchant ships headed from [[Bergen]] to [[Lerwick]], escorted by the destroyers [[HMS Strongbow (1916)|HMS ''Strongbow'']] and [[HMS Mary Rose (1915)|HMS ''Mary Rose'']] and two armed trawlers.<ref name="CN114">{{cite book |last=Booth|title=Cox's Navy|page=114}}</ref> At dawn lookouts aboard ''Stronghold'' reported two unidentified ships closing on the convoy. Mistaking them for British cruisers ''Strongbow'' flashed recognition signals, but was suddenly fired upon at a range of 3,000 yards by a barrage of 6-inch shells.<ref name="COS"/> ''Mary Rose'' tried to come to her assistance but was also hit, with both ships sinking. ''Brummer'' and ''Bremse'' then turned their attention to the convoy, hunting down and sinking nine of the merchants, before returning to port.<ref name="COS"/> One of the armed trawlers, the ''Elise'', was fired on by ''Bremse'' while attempting to pick up survivors.<ref name="CN114"/> None of the ships were able to send a wireless report, and despite having a squadron of sixteen light cruisers at sea to the south of the convoy, the British did not learn of the attack until 4:00pm, when it was too late. Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] said of the action that 'luck was against us.'<ref name="COS"/> The Admiralty responded to the raid by adding more and bigger escorts.<ref name="CN114"/>

==Internment and scuttling==
[[File:Entering Scapa Flow.jpg|thumb|right|Ships of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] sailing to be interned. Visible are {{SMS|Emden|1916|6}}, {{SMS|Frankfurt}}, and SMS ''Bremse''.]]
After the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in November 1918, ''Bremse'' and the remainder of the [[High Seas Fleet]] were interned at the British naval base at [[Scapa Flow]] pending the outcomes of negotiations of the final peace treaty.  After being inspected by [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] crews the ships were interned at [[Gutter Sound]].  Many of the ships were then [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttled on 21 June 1919]], on Rear-Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]]'s orders. An armed British naval party had attempted to board ''Bremse'' and close her bottom valves, but found that they were already below the rising waterline.<ref name="CN114"/> Instead they blasted off her anchor chains and she was taken in tow by a tug and the destroyer {{HMS|Venetia|1917|6}}, in an attempt to beach her before she sank.<ref name="CN114"/> They managed to run her bow onto the beach, south of [[Cava, Orkney|Cava]], but the steeply sloping approach meant that her stern settled in deeper water, and she rolled over and sank in 75 feet of water, leaving her bow visible at low tide.<ref name="CN114"/><ref name="JJ">{{cite book |last=George|title=Jutland to Junkyard|page=87}}</ref>

==Salvage==
Though the Admiralty arranged for some of the ships to be salvaged, most were left at the bottom of the sound until entrepreneur [[Ernest Cox]] bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships. ''Bremse'' presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water.<ref name="JJ"/> Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously.<ref name="JJ"/> A three-man team using [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxyacetylene torches]] ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.<ref name="JJ88">{{cite book |last=George|title=Jutland to Junkyard|page=88}}</ref>

By July 1929 the last of the superstructure had been cleared, and ''Bremse'' was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side.<ref name="CN115">{{cite book |last=Booth|title=Cox's Navy|page=115}}</ref> The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.<ref name="JJ88"/> It was thought that the failure had been caused by there being too much remaining superstructure, and attempts were made to clean out the large quantity of oil that had spilled out during the attempt to raise her.  The decision was made to burn off the oil, but the fire spread and had to be brought back under control.<ref name="JJ88"/> She was again patched up and pumped with air, breaking the surface on 29 November. The ''Bremse'' was eventually considered too unsafe to tow to [[Rosyth]] for scrapping, as had been done with the other ships Cox had salvaged, and instead she was taken to [[Lyness]] on 30 November 1929 and broken up there.<ref name="JJ88"/>
