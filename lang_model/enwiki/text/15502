'''''Gremlins''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[horror film|horror]]-[[comedy film|comedy]] [[film]] directed by [[Joe Dante]] and released in [[1984 in film|1984]].  It is about a young man who receives a strange creature named Gizmo as a [[pet]].  The creature then spawns other creatures who transform into small, destructive [[monster]]s.  This story was continued with a sequel, ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', which was released in 1990. Unlike the lighter sequel, the original ''Gremlins'' opts for more [[black comedy]], which is balanced against a [[Christmas]]time setting.

Experienced filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] was the film's [[executive producer]].  The screenplay was written by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]].  ''Gremlins'' stars [[Zach Galligan]] and [[Phoebe Cates]], with [[Howie Mandel]] providing the voice of Gizmo.  The actors had to work alongside numerous [[puppet]]s, as puppetry was the main form of [[special effect]]s used to portray Gizmo and the gremlins.  These puppets became the real focal point of the film.

''Gremlins'' was a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|commercial success]] and received some positive feedback from critics.  It was also at the centre of a large [[merchandising]] campaign.  However, the film has also been heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences.  Critics alleged these scenes made the film inappropriate for younger audiences who could be admitted into [[Movie theater|theatres]] under its PG rating.  In response, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) reformed its [[MPAA film rating system|rating system]].

==Plot==
<!-- Please help keep this section brief.  Every detail about the plot does not need to appear here. -->
{{spoiler}}
The film starts by introducing the character Randall "Rand" Peltzer, an inventor of modest abilities and questionable success.  He is from the fictional community of Kingston Falls, and travels to [[Chinatown]] in [[New York City]] to sell his inventions and pick up a present for his son Billy. A young Chinese boy takes Rand to his grandfather's small shop, where Rand takes interest in a small, cute, furry creature called a [[mogwai]] (which, in [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] [[Chinese language|Chinese]], translates literally as "evil spirit"). Mr. Wing, the Chinese boy's grandfather and owner of the shop, refuses to sell the mogwai even when Rand offers $200 for it.  This is money that the Wing family desperately needs.  Consequently, Wing's grandson secretly sells the mogwai to Rand. Though the creature seems innocent enough, the grandson warns Rand that one must take certain precautions regarding it.  Namely, one must not let the mogwai near bright light, especially sunlight, which can kill the mogwai, one must not get water on the mogwai, and, most importantly, one must never feed the creature after midnight.

Rand names the creature "Gizmo" and brings him home to his son. Billy has recently completed high school and has taken up a job at the bank to make ends meet for his parents, whom he still lives with.  He owns one dog, Barney, but Barney's mischievousness makes both him and Billy the target of harassment from Mrs. Deagle, an elderly woman with much financial influence.  Being a bitter, malicious person, she threatens to kidnap and murder Barney.

[[Image:Mogwais-in-school-lab.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Two mogwai in the science lab of the local high school.]]

Billy is fascinated with Gizmo, who is highly intelligent and can [[hum]] a tune.  Billy's new companion also proves to be a very gentle and well-behaved creature.  Unfortunately, however, one of Billy's friends accidentally spills water on Gizmo.  This causes Gizmo to instantly multiply, spawning five new mogwai in a process that appears painful to him. The new mogwai are much more aggressive than Gizmo.  They are led by the mogwai Stripe, who has a white [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]-like hairstyle.

At about this time Billy's personal life takes a more positive turn.  He asks his coworker at the bank, Kate, out for a date, and she agrees.  Kate is also a local bartender, who sees first hand the misery in the town caused by Mrs. Deagle's inhumane financial leadership.

Eventually the mogwai fool Billy into feeding them after midnight.  All the creatures soon form [[cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s, except Gizmo, who was wise enough to not accept the food Billy offered after midnight.  While Billy is at the bank, the cocoons hatch, and the mogwai emerge having transformed into [[gremlin]]-like monsters with dark green reptilian skin.  Billy's mother is now alone with the gremlins and comes into conflict with them.  She manages to defeat them one-by-one, killing one in the [[blender (device)|blender]]. She stabs a second with a [[kitchen knife]], and traps a third in the [[microwave oven]], which she turns on. The gremlin promptly explodes. While she is strangled by the next gremlin, at this point Billy arrives and saves her by decapitating the gremlin with an ornamental sword. The only remaining gremlin left in the house is Stripe, who then breaks out. Billy tracks him down to the local [[YMCA]], but the creature escapes once more by jumping into a swimming pool. This causes an incredible multiplication of gremlins. 

[[Image:Gremlin_eating_cookie.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A gremlin eating a [[gingerbread man]].]]
Billy then takes Gizmo to the bar to recover Kate, who has been bartending that night.  The gremlins have taken over the bar and force Kate to serve them.  However, she eventually discovers they are frightened by light when she attempts to light one's cigarette.  She then knocks down several through [[flash (photography)|flash photography]], and is reunited with Billy.  The two seek shelter in the bank while the gremlins wreak havoc upon Kingston Falls.  Notably, the creatures kill Mrs. Deagle.  When Billy, Kate and Gizmo re-emerge, they find the gremlins are gone.  Billy and Kate track them down to the local theatre, and Billy manages to explode it.  The gremlins burn to death, with the exception of Stripe, who had left briefly to get snacks at the [[department store]] across the street.

Billy pursues Stripe through the store, but Stripe escapes and reaches a water fountain.  By this time, however, it is morning, and Gizmo, having escaped notice of the human characters, opens a blind and exposes Stripe to sunlight.  Stripe melts as everyone watches.

At the end of the film, Mr. Wing returns to collect Gizmo to prevent any reoccurrence of trouble. Mr. Wing observes that while western society is not ready to properly care for a mogwai, Billy shows some potential.

==Production==
===Background===
''Gremlins'' was produced during a time when combining horror with comedy became increasingly popular.  The film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', released in the same year as ''Gremlins'', and later ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) and other such films, were part of this growing trend.  The new genre seemed to emphasize sudden shifts between humorous and horrific scenes, and/or drawing laughs with plot elements that have been traditionally used to scare.  The comic strip ''[[The Far Side]]'' indicated this was a broader cultural phenomenon.  However, this drew from older precedent, such as the film ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).<ref>No<U+00EB>l Carroll, "Horror and Humor," ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 57, No. 2, ''Aesthetics and Popular Culture'' (Spring, 1999), page 145.</ref>

The notion of "gremlins" was first conceived during [[World War II]], when mechanical failures in airplanes were jokingly blamed on the small monsters.  Gremlins entered [[popular culture]] as children's author [[Roald Dahl]] published a book called ''[[The Gremlins]]'' in 1943, based on these mischievous creatures.<ref>Roger E. Bilstein, ''Flight in America: From the Wrights to the Astronauts'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), p. 318, ISBN 0801866855.</ref>  Dante had read ''The Gremlins'' and claimed this book was of some influence to his film.  Dahl's story is referenced in the film when the character Mr. Futterman, played by [[Dick Miller]], drunkenly warns Billy and Kate of foreign technology sabotaged by gremlins: "It's the same gremlins that brought down our planes in the big one... That's right. World War II."<ref name="DVD">DVD commentary; Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins.'' Special edition.  Warner Home Video, 2002.</ref>  ''[[Falling Hare]]'', a film about the fictional character [[Bugs Bunny]] and a gremlin, was released by [[Warner Bros.]], also in 1943.  In 1983, Dante publicly distanced his work from earlier film.  He explained, "Our gremlins are somewhat different&mdash;they're sort of green and they have big mouths and they smile a lot and they do incredibly, really nasty things to people and enjoy it all the while."<ref name="Featurette">''Gremlins:  Behind the Scenes'', Warner Bros., 1983, in the DVD Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins.'' Special edition.  Warner Home Video, 2002.</ref>

===Initial stages===
[[Image:JoeDante.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|[[Joe Dante]] was the director of the film ''Gremlins''.]]
The story of ''Gremlins'' was conceived by Chris Columbus.  As Columbus explained, his inspiration came from his loft, when at night "what sounded like a platoon of [[mouse|mice]] would come out and to hear them skittering around in the blackness was really creepy."<ref name="Behind Scenes">''Behind the Scenes'', in the DVD Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins.'' Special edition.  Warner Home Video, 2002.</ref>  He then wrote the original screenplay as a "writing sample" to show potential employers that he had writing abilities.  The story was not actually intended to be filmed until Spielberg took an interest in it.<ref name="DVD"/>  As Spielberg explained, "It's one of the most original things I've come across in many years, which is why I bought it."<ref name="Featurette"/>

Spielberg chose Dante as his director because of Dante's experience with horror-comedy; Dante had directed ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' (1981), though in the time between ''The Howling'' and the offer to film ''Gremlins'', he had experienced a lull in his career.<ref name="DVD"/>  The film's producer was [[Michael Finnell]], who had also worked on ''The Howling''.  Spielberg took the project to Warner Bros. and also produced it with his own company, [[Amblin Entertainment]].

The film's script went through a few drafts before a shooting script was finalized. The first version was much darker. Scenes were cut portraying Billy's mother dying in her struggle with the gremlins, and her head thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives.  Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than what the filmmakers wanted.  Also, instead of Stripe being a mogwai who becomes a gremlin, there was no Stripe mogwai and Gizmo was supposed to turn into Stripe the gremlin.  Spielberg overruled this plot element because he felt Gizmo was cute and audiences would want him to be present at all stages of the film.<ref name="DVD"/>

There is a famous [[urban legend]] referenced in the film, <ref>"[http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/stuck.asp  Santa Claustrophobia]". ''[[Urban Legends Reference Pages]]''. October 23, 1999.</ref> in which Kate reveals in a speech that her father died on a Christmas when he dressed as [[Santa Claus]] but broke his neck while climbing down the family's chimney.  It was rumored that Columbus had written the scene as drama,<ref name="Grant"> Edmond Grant, "''Gremlins 2''," ''Films in Review'', October 1990, vol. 41, issue 10, page 485-487.</ref> though the filmmakers and performers took it as dark comedy. This scene was always a part of the ''Gremlins'' story. In the film the speech was delivered in the bank.  One early version of the script included the speech in a scene where the leading characters found a [[McDonald's]] restaurant after it had been attacked and the patrons eaten, but the hamburgers were untouched. Later, the filmed speech would be controversial, as studio executives insisted upon its removal.  They felt it was too ambiguous as to whether it was supposed to be funny or sad.  Dante stubbornly refused to take the scene out, saying it represented the film as a whole, which had a combination of horrific and comedic elements.  Spielberg did not like the scene but, despite his creative control, he viewed ''Gremlins'' as Dante's project and left it in.<ref name="DVD"/>

===Casting===
The speech was given by the character Kate, played by Phoebe Cates.  She received the role despite concerns that she was known for playing more risque parts, such as Linda Barrett in ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' (1982).  Spielberg urged the casting of the relatively unknown Zach Galligan for Billy, because Spielberg saw chemistry between Galligan and Cates during auditions.  Galligan later compared himself to Billy, saying he was a "[[geek|geeky]] kid- and so being... in this picture for me was really kind of a dream, I mean what I get to do, what my character gets to do, blow up movie theatres... got to work with great people."<ref name="DVD"/>

In contrast to Galligan, many of the supporting actors and actresses were better known.  Many where [[character actor]]s.  [[Glynn Turman]] was more experienced.  He portrays a science teacher who studies a mogwai and is killed by it after it forms a cocoon.  Dick Miller was more experienced than Galligan as well.  As a result, Galligan had the opportunity to query both on the set about their careers.  Rand was played by [[Hoyt Axton]], who was always the filmmakers' preferred choice for the role even though it was widely contested by other actors.  Axton's experience included acting in ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979) and he was also a [[country music]] singer.  Since an introductory scene to ''Gremlins'' was cut, Axton's voice earned him the role of the [[narrator]], to establish some context. Mr. Wing was played by [[Keye Luke]], another experienced actor.  Although he was around 80 in reality and his character is very elderly, Luke's youthful appearance required [[make-up]] to cover.<ref name="DVD"/>

[[Polly Holliday]], an actress known for her role in ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', played Mrs. Deagle.  Dante considered the casting fortunate, as she was well-known and he considered her to be talented.  Ironically, two other well-known actors, ''Fast Times''' [[Judge Reinhold]] and character actor [[Edward Andrews]], received roles that were significantly reduced after the film was edited.  They played Billy's superiors at the bank.<ref name="DVD"/>

===Special effects===
The performances were shot on the [[backlot]] of [[Universal Studios]] in [[California]].  This required fake snow.  Dante also felt it was an atmosphere that would make the special effects more convincing.  As the special effects relied mainly on puppetry, the actors worked alongside some of the puppets.  Nevertheless, after the actors finished their work for good, a great deal of work was spent finishing the effects.  Numerous small [[rubber]] puppets, some of which were mechanical, were used to portray Gizmo and the gremlins.  They were designed by [[Chris Walas]]. There was more than one Gizmo puppet, and occasionally Galligan, when carrying one, would set him down off camera, and when Gizmo appeared again sitting on a surface it was actually a different puppet wired to the surface.  These puppets had many limitations.  The Gizmo puppets were particularly frustrating because they were smaller and thus broke down more.  Consequently, to satisfy the crew, a scene was included in which the gremlins hang Gizmo on a wall and throw darts at him.<ref name="DVD"/>  

A few [[marionette]]s were also used.  Other effects required large mogwai faces and ears to be produced for [[close-up]]s, as the puppets were less capable of conveying [[emotion]].  Consequently, large [[Theatrical properties|props]] simulating food were needed for the close-ups in the scene in which the mogwai feast after midnight.  An enlarged Gizmo puppet was also needed for the scene in which he multiplies.  The new mogwai, who popped out of Gizmo's body as small, furry balls which then started to grow, were [[balloon]]s and expanded as such.  Walas had also created the exploding gremlin in the microwave by means of a balloon that was allowed to burst.<ref name="DVD"/>

Howie Mandel provided the voice for Gizmo and the prolific voice actor [[Frank Welker]] provided the voice for Stripe. It was Welker who suggested Mandel perform in ''Gremlins''.  The puppets' lines were mostly invented by the voice actors, based on cues from the physical actions of the puppets, which were filmed before the voice work.  Mandel also chose the type of voice for Gizmo, which was [[baby]]-like, based on what had been done.  Mandel explained, Gizmo was "cute and naive, so, you know, I got in touch with that... I couldn't envision going any other way or do something different with it.  I didn't try a few different voices."<ref name="DVD"/>

===Music===
The film's score was written by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].  For his effort, he won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]].  The main score was written with the objective of conveying "the mischievous humor and mounting suspense of Gremlins."<ref name="Behind Scenes"/>  As the filmmakers recalled, the so-called "Gremlin Rag" came across not as "[[horror music]]" but as "[[circus music]]," and some cited it as an influence to their later work on the film.  Within the story, Gizmo was capable of singing or humming.  Goldsmith wrote Gizmo's song as well, but Mandel never sang it.  A girl Goldsmith knew was hired to sing Gizmo's song, although she had never worked in films before.<ref name="DVD"/>

Songs heard in the film include "Gremlins... Mega-Madness" by [[Michael Sembello]].  This song is played while the gremlins party in the bar, and one [[breakdancing|break dances]] to it.  [[Darlene Love]]'s song "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" plays over the [[opening credits]].

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
The reactions of [[film critic]]s to ''Gremlins'' varied.  [[Roger Ebert]] was approving, calling the film not only "fun" but a "sly series of send-ups," effectively [[parody]]ing many elemental film story-lines.  In his opinion, ''Gremlins'' does this partly through depictions of mysterious worlds (the shop in Chinatown) and tyrannical elderly women (Mrs. Deagle).  Ebert also believed the rule in which a mogwai cannot eat after midnight was inspired by [[fairy tale]]s, and that the final scenes parody the classic horror films.  He connected Kate's speech about her father with "the great tradition of 1950s sick jokes."<ref>Roger Ebert, "Gremlins," January 1, 1984.  ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]].''</ref> Conversely, [[Leonard Maltin]] disapproved while on the television show ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''.  He called the film "icky" and "gross."<ref name="Grant"/> Later, he wrote in his book that despite being set in a "picture-[[postcard]] town" and blending the feel of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' with that of ''[[The Blob]]'', the film is "negated by too-vivid violence and mayhem." He thus gave the film two out of four stars.<ref>Leonard Maltin, ed., ''Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie & Video Guide.'' A Signet Book, 2001, page 557.</ref>  Maltin actually made an appearance in ''Gremlins 2'' and repeated his criticisms of the original on film, as an [[in-joke]].

One scholar acknowledged some critics thought the death scenes and Kate's speech cannot be funny, and that even depictions of [[greed]], in that the gremlins indulge in gluttony, cannot be funny.  However, this scholar suggested that in its depiction of these things, ''Gremlins'' emerges as a [[satire]] of "some characteristics of [[Western civilization]]."  The film may suggest that Westerners take too much satisfaction out of violence.  ''Gremlins'' can also be a statement against [[technology]], in that some characters, like Billy's father, are over-dependent on it.  In contrast, Mr. Wing is shown having a strong distaste for television.<ref>Charlotte Miller, "Using ''Gremlins'' to Teach Theme," ''The English Journal'', Vol. 74, No. 4. (Apr., 1985), p. 69.</ref>  One scholar suggested the film is meant to express a number of observations of society by having the gremlin characters shift in what they are meant to represent.  At different times, they are [[African American]]s or [[teenager]]s, the wealthy establishment, or fans of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films.<ref>Jonathan Rosenbaum, review of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit|Who Framed Roger Rabbit?]]'' by [[Robert Zemeckis]], ''[[Film Quarterly]]'', vol. 42, no. 1. (Autumn, 1988), page 37.</ref>  The film the gremlins had been watching in the theatre before Billy exploded it was Disney's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

Another scholar drew a connection between the microwave scene and urban legends about pets dying in microwave ovens.  He described the portrayal of this urban legend in the film as successful, but that meant it seemed terrible.<ref name="Doyle">Charles Clay Doyle, "The Avenging Voice from the Depths," ''Western Folklore'', Vol. 47, No. 1 (Jan., 1988), page 21.</ref> This is indeed a scene that is thought of as being one of the film's most violent.  Even Ebert expressed some fear in his review that the film might encourage children to try similar things with their pets, and he urged parents not to let their children see the film.

It should be noted ''Gremlins'' has been criticized for more than its depictions of violence.  One [[BBC]] critic wrote in 2000 that "The plot is thin and the pacing is askew."  However, that critic also complimented the dark humour contrasted against the ideal Christmas setting.<ref>Almar Haflidason, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/12/15/gremlins_1984_review.shtml Gremlins (1984)]," ''Film Reviews'', BBC, URL accessed 29 April 2006.</ref>  In 2002, another critic wrote that in hindsight ''Gremlins'' has "corny special effects" and that the film will likely appeal to children more so than to adults.  He also said the acting was dull.<ref>Blake French, "[http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/763408a278500cd788256c2b00838caf?OpenDocument Gremlins]", ''Filmcritic.com'', 2002.  URL accessed 3 May 2006.</ref>

''Gremlins'' won numerous awards, including the 1985 [[Saturn Award]]s for Best Director, Best Horror Film, Best Music, and Best Special Effects, and Holliday won the award for Best Supporting Actress.  The film also won the 1985 [[Golden Screen Award]] and the 1985 [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Family Motion Picture (Adventure). [[Corey Feldman]], who played Billy's young friend, was also nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture Musical, Comedy, Adventure or Drama.

===''Gremlins'' and audiences===
[[Image:Gremlins.png|thumb|The DVD cover in 1999, featuring the character Stripe.]]
''Gremlins'' was a commercial success.  It was filmed on a budget of $11,000,000, making it more expensive than Spielberg had originally intended but still relatively cheap for 1984.<ref name="DVD"/>  The [[trailer (film)|trailer]] introduced the film to audiences by briefly explaining that Billy receives a strange creature as a Christmas present, by going over the three rules, and then coming out with the fact that the creatures transform into terrible monsters.  This trailer showed little of either the mogwai or the gremlins.<ref>''Theatrical Trailers'', in the DVD Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins.'' Special edition.  Warner Home Video, 2002.</ref>  Conversely, other advertisements concentrated on Gizmo, overlooked the gremlins and made the film look similar to Spielberg's earlier family film, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982).<ref name="PG-13">Anthony Breznican, "[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/movies/187529_pg13rating24.html PG-13 remade Hollywood ratings system]", [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]], Tuesday, August 24, 2004.</ref>

Afterwards, ''Gremlins'' was released into US theatres on June 8, 1984. It grossed $12.5 million in its first weekend.  By the end of its American screenings, on November 29, it had grossed $148,168,459 domestically.  This made it the fourth highest-grossing film of the year, after ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', ''Ghostbusters'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.<ref name="box office">"[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gremlins.htm Gremlins]," ''[[Box Office Mojo]]''.  URL accessed 30 April 2006.</ref>  In August it opened in [[Argentina]] and [[Spain]] and in October it premiered in [[West Germany]].  Screenings began in [[Australia]] and much of the rest of [[Europe]] in December.<ref>"[http://imdb.com/title/tt0087363/releaseinfo Release dates for Gremlins]" [[The Internet Movie Database]], URL accessed 11 May 2006.</ref>  As ''Gremlins'' had an international audience, different versions of the film were made to overcome cultural barriers.  Mandel learned to speak his few intelligible lines, such as "Bright light!", into various languages such as [[German language|German]].  Regional music and humor were also incorporated into foreign language versions.  Dante credited this work for ''Gremlins''' worldwide success.<ref name="DVD"/>

Still, there had also been complaints among audiences about the violence.  This was true particularly among people who had brought their children to see the film.  Many had walked out of the theatre before the film had ended.  Dante admitted to reporters later, "So the idea of taking a 4-year-old to see ''Gremlins'', thinking it's going to be a cuddly, funny animal movie and then seeing that it turns into a horror picture, I think people were upset... They felt like they had been sold something family friendly and it wasn't entirely family friendly."<ref name="PG-13"/>

The film became available to audiences again when brought back to theatres in 1985.  This brought its gross up to  $153,083,102.<ref name="box office"/>  It was also released on [[video]], and made $79,500,000 in [[Rental shop|rental stores]].<ref>"[http://imdb.com/title/tt0087363/business Business Data for Gremlins]" The Internet Movie Database, URL accessed 7 May 2006.</ref>  The [[DVD]] was released in 1997 and 1999. On August 20, 2002, a "[[special edition]]" DVD was released featuring cast and filmmakers' commentary and deleted scenes.

==Merchandising==
[[Image:Neca-mogwaii-action-figure.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] [[plushies]] released 2005.]]
With its commercial themes, especially the perceived [[cuteness]] of the character Gizmo, ''Gremlins'' became the centre of considerable merchandising.  As such, it became part of a rising trend in film, which had received a boost from Spielberg's ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''.<ref name="DVD"/>  Under the [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]], versions of Gizmo were sold as [[doll]]s or [[stuffed animal]]s.  Both Gizmo and the gremlins were mass produced as [[action figure]]s.  Additionally, [[Topps]] made [[trading card]]s based upon the film.<ref> [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A1R4Q Gremlins Action Figure: Gizmo by NECA], ''[[Amazon.com]]'', URL accessed 30 April 2006; [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A1R4O Gremlins Action Figure: Poker Player by NECA], ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed 30 April 2006; [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000EO5MRI Gremlins Movie Photo Trading Cards Box -36 Count by Topps]," ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed 30 April 2006.</ref>

The film was also the basis for a [[novel]] of the same name by [[George Gipe]], published by [[Avon Books]] in June 1984.  The novel offered an origin for mogwai and gremlins as a prologue. Supposedly, mogwai were created as gentle, contemplative creatures by a scientist on an alien world.  However, it was discovered that their physiology was unstable, and under "certain circumstances," alluding to the three rules that were given in the film, mogwai would change into creatures that the somewhat sanitized novel referred to as "mischievous". This origin is unique to the novel.  No definitive origin for mogwai or gremlins is ever given in either ''Gremlins'' film.

Several [[video game]]s based on the film were also produced.  These included ''Gremlins'' (1985) by [[Brian Howarth]] and [[Adventure Soft]].  In the 2000s more were released.  ''Gremlins: Unleashed!'' was released on [[Game Boy]] in 2001.  It was about Gizmo trying to catch Stripe and thirty gremlins, while the gremlins try to turn Gizmo himself into a gremlin.  Both Gizmo and Stripe are playable characters in this game.<ref>"[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OW8Z/202-4969683-6358259 Gremlins Unleashed]", ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed 3 May 2006.</ref>  ''Gremlins: Stripe Versus Gizmo'', with both Gizmo and Stripe as playable characters, was released in 2002.

==Legacy==
Along with ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'', ''Gremlins'' was one of two films in 1984 to influence the MPAA to create the PG-13 rating. Both were rated PG.  The scene in which a gremlin explodes in the microwave was particularly influential to the idea that some films too light to be rated R are still too mature to be rated PG. Indeed, before ''Gremlins'' came out the controversy over ''Indiana Jones'' might very well have died.  The change to the rating system was not insignificant.  The rating PG-13 turned out to be appealing to some film patrons, as it implied some excitement without going too far.<ref name="PG-13"/>

The film not only spawned a sequel, ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', but is believed to be the inspiration for several other unrelated films about small monsters, many of which have similar one-word titles.  These include ''[[Critters (film series)|Critters]]'',<ref>Maltin, 298.</ref> ''[[Ghoulies]]'',<ref name="Doyle"/> ''[[Troll (film)|Troll]]'',<ref>Maltin, 1141.</ref> ''[[Hobgoblins (film)|Hobgoblins]]'',<ref> Jason Gibner, [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll ''Hobgoblins.''] ''[[All Movie Guide]]''.  URL accessed 28 April 2006.</ref> and ''[[Munchies (film)|Munchies]]''.<ref>Jeremy Wheeler [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll ''Munchies''], ''All Movie Guide''.  URL accessed 28 April 2006.</ref>  Many of these films were not critical successes, and ''Hobgoblins'' appeared on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

There were rumors that the talking doll [[Furby]] was so similar to the character Gizmo that Warner Bros. was considering a lawsuit in 1998, but Warner representatives replied that this was not true.<ref>"Gizmo And Furby To Co-Exist," 24 December 1998, ''StudioBriefing''.</ref>  In fact, a Furby-based Gizmo toy was later produced by the same company that made Furby.  The [[anime]] ''[[Pet Shop of Horrors]]'' has also been compared to ''Gremlins''.<ref>"[http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/alt_reviews/416.php Pet Shop of Horrors]," ''Anime on DVD Reviews'', URL accessed 30 April 2006.</ref>
