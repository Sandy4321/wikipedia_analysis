'''''The Great Mouse Detective''''' is a 1986 [[animation|animated feature]] produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], originally released to [[movie theater]]s on July 2, 1986 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The 26th animated feature in the official canon, the film was directed by Burny Mattinson, David Michener, and the team of [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], who later directed Disney's hit films ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. The film was also known as '''''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective''''' for its 1992 theatrical re-release and '''''Basil the Great Mouse Detective''''' in some countries. The main characters are all [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[London]].

Based on the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]], it draws heavily on the tradition of [[Sherlock Holmes]] with a heroic mouse who consciously emulates the detective; Titus named the main character after actor [[Basil Rathbone]], who is best remembered for playing Holmes in film (and whose voice, sampled from a 1966 reading of "[[The Adventure of the Red-Headed League]]"<ref name="usa">{{cite news |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2011/02/How-Basil-Saved-Disney-Feature-Animation-Part-One/144296/1 |title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One |accessdate=2012-01-16 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> was the voice of Holmes in this film, 19 years after his death). Interestingly, Sherlock Holmes also mentions "Basil" as one of his aliases in the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story "[[The Adventure of Black Peter]]".

After the failure of the Disney animated feature film ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'', this simpler film proved to be a success upon its initial release in 1986. As such, the new senior management of the company were convinced that their animation department was still a viable enterprise and this set the stage for the [[Disney Renaissance]].

==Plot==
In [[London]], circa 1897, a young [[Scottish people|Scottish]] mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her [[wikt:toymaker|toymaker]] father, Hiram. Suddenly, Fidget, a bat with a [[peg leg]], barges in, and after a brief struggle, disappears with Hiram. Fidget takes Hiram to Professor Ratigan who commands him to create a [[clockwork]] [[robot]] which mimics the Queen of the Mice so Ratigan can rule [[England]]. Hiram initially refuses to take part in the scheme, whereupon Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia.

Olivia searches to find Basil of Baker Street, a world-famous detective and Ratigan's archnemesis. Returning to London after a [[tour of duty]] in [[Afghanistan]], Dr. David Q. Dawson stumbles upon Olivia, and helps her find Basil's residence. At first, Basil is reluctant, but when Olivia mentions Fidget, Basil now realizes his chance to capture Ratigan. Basil and Dawson take Toby, [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s pet [[dog]], to track Fidget's scent, where they find him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget later traps Olivia by ambushing her from inside a toy cradle. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the [[Thames]]. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as [[sailor]]s and go into a tavern called the "Rat Trap" and follow Fidget to Ratigan's headquarters. They are caught, and Ratigan ties them to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]]. Ratigan sets out for [[Buckingham Palace]], where Fidget and his accomplices kidnap the queen. Basil, along with Dawson, deduces the trap's weakness and escape just in time.

Back at Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Hiram to operate the toy Queen, while the real Queen is taken to be fed to Felicia. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his tyrannical plans for his new "subjects". Just then, Basil, Dawson and Olivia save Hiram and the real Queen, and apprehend Fidget (along with Ratigan's other henchmen). Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud and tyrant while breaking into pieces. The crowd, enraged by Ratigan's [[treason]], start climbing on him and defeating his shanty guards (meanwhile, Toby chases down Felicia and delivers her straight to the Royal Guard Dogs). Ratigan frees himself and escapes on his [[dirigible]] with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage. Basil, Dawson, and Hiram create their own craft with a matchbox and some small [[helium]]-filled balloons, held under the [[Union Jack]]. Ratigan throws Fidget (who can't fly) into the [[Thames River]] to his death, and then attempts to drive the dirigible himself. Basil jumps on to the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing him to crash straight into the [[Big Ben]]. Inside the clock, Basil manages to get Ratigan's cape stuck on some gears and rescues Olivia and safely delivers her to Hiram. Ratigan, however breaks free and nearly kills Basil (even knocking him to the dirigible) until the clock bell strikes 10:00 and Ratigan falls to his death, taking Basil with him. However, Basil manages to grab the wreckage of Ratigan's dirigible and save himself from falling just in time.

Back at Baker Street, Basil and Dawson recount their adventures, as well as the queen's gratitude for saving her life. Afterwards, the Flavershams leave to catch their train. As Dawson tries to leave, a distraught new client persuades both Basil and Dawson to help her. Finally, Basil proclaims Dawson to be his "trusted associate, Doctor Dawson, with whom I do all my cases".

==Cast==
* [[Barrie Ingham]] as '''Basil''': A detective, based on the fictional sleuth [[Sherlock Holmes]] and the primary [[protagonist]] of the film. His main goal is to get Professor Ratigan behind bars and rescue Olivia Flaversham's father, while simultaneously preventing a royal assassination. There are a few differences between Basil in the book series and in the film version, such as mercurial moods in the latter. He also plays the violin rather well in the movie, whereas the book series stated Basil's [[violin]] playing was atrocious<U+2014>instead, Basil played the [[flute]].
* [[Vincent Price]] as '''Professor Ratigan''': Basil's archenemy and the primary [[antagonist]] of the film. He is based on [[Professor James Moriarty]] from the Sherlock Holmes stories. He plots to seize control of the British monarchy. He and Basil are long-established archenemies. In the book series, it is revealed his given name is Padraic and that Ratigan is, in fact, a mouse. At the end of the film, he is knocked off [[Big Ben]] and disappears into the deep chasm below, following a fierce battle with Basil, similar to the Sherlock Homes story "[[The Final Problem]]".
* [[Val Bettin]] as '''Major Dr. David Q. Dawson''', previously of the Queen's [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot|66th Regiment]] in [[Afghanistan]]. His character is based upon [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John H. Watson]] from the Sherlock Holmes stories. The interaction between him and Basil mimics that of Watson and Holmes, as Dawson is constantly amazed by Basil's deductions. He eventually becomes Basil's associate, friend, and personal biographer.
* Susanne Pollatschek as '''Olivia Flaversham''': A eight-year-old female mouse of Scottish descent who seeks Basil's help in finding her toymaker father.
* [[Candy Candido]] as '''Fidget''': Ratigan's bumbling [[bat]] henchman. He tends to do the dirty work for his boss. He has a crippled wing and a peg leg, and, as a result, he cannot fly. Ratigan throws him off the side of his flying machine near the end of the film, and he falls into the [[Thames]]. He survives the fall in the book (how is not explained). 
* [[Frank Welker]] as '''Toby''': Basil's trustful [[Basset Hound]]. He technically belongs to [[Sherlock Holmes]], who lives above Basil.
* [[Alan Young]] as '''Hiram Flaversham''': Olivia's loving Scottish father. He works as a toymaker, and is kidnapped by Fidget to make the Queen Mousetoria robot for the evil Ratigan.
* [[Frank Welker]] as '''Felicia''': Ratigan's massive and pompous pet cat. Ratigan calls upon her by ringing a special bell to dispose of traitors or anyone who makes him angry. She is chased by Toby and attacked by Royal Guard Dogs in the final part of the movie and is not seen again. She is presumed dead.
* Diana Chesney as '''Mrs. Judson''': Basil's housekeeper. She adores Basil, but gets very annoyed when he mistreats her good pillows by shooting them with a [[pistol]]. She is based on [[Mrs. Hudson]].
* Eve Brenner as '''Queen Mousetoria''': The mouse queen of England, whom Ratigan attempts to depose of. She is a [[parody]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and the setting for this film coincides with the real Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] (as can be seen with humans entering Buckingham Palace at the same time the mice are).
* [[Barrie Ingham]] as '''Bartholomew''': One of Ratigan's henchmen. He meets his end early on during Ratigan's song when he drunkenly calls his boss a rat; enraged, Ratigan throws him outside and summons Felicia, who devours him.
* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]: The famous human detective who lives above Basil. His voice is taken from clips of the original Sherlock Holmes films.
* [[Laurie Main]] as [[Doctor Watson|Dr. Watson]]: The medical associate/partner of Sherlock Holmes, who also lives above Basil. Unlike Rathbone, voice clips of Nigel Bruce were not used for the cameo part of Watson.

==Production==
The layouts were done on computers, and the use of video cameras made a digital version of pencil testing possible. The movie is also notable for its early use of [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI) for a chase scene that takes place in the interior of [[Big Ben]]. The movements of the clock's gears were produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer, printed out and traced onto animation cells where colors and the characters were added. ''The Great Mouse Detective'' is sometimes cited as the first animated film from Walt Disney Pictures to use CGI; in reality, 1985's ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' has this distinction.

Initially, Olivia was to be an older character with the potential as a love interest for Basil or even an infatuated Dr. Dawson, before it was decided that she should be a child to better garner audience sympathy. While visually, Basil and Dawson were based on [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|Rathbone and Bruce]], their voices and personalities were not. Basil's voice was modeled on [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]<U+2019>s portrayal of Henry Higgins in the film ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]''<ref name="usa">{{cite news |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2011/02/How-Basil-Saved-Disney-Feature-Animation-Part-One/144296/1 |title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One |accessdate=2012-01-16 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> while Dawson's voice was modeled on Disney animation legend [[Eric Larson]].<ref name="usa"/>

{{quote|"We didn<U+2019>t want to make them simply miniature versions of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce," Clements affirmed. "Dawson<U+2019>s not a buffoon. He<U+2019>s a foil for Basil but also a warm and caring person."<ref name="usa"/>}}

Disney decision to call the film ''The Great Mouse Detective'' and not ''Basil of Baker Street'' was unpopular with the filmmakers. Animator Ed Gombert wrote a satirical interoffice memo, allegedly by studio executive [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], which gave other Disney films generic titles such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Seven Little Men Help a Girl]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|The Girl with the See-through Shoes]]'', and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|Puppies Taken Away]]''.<ref name="gombert1986">{{cite web | url=http://www.drawn2gether.com/blog/2008/03/24/crew-picture-the-great-mouse-detective/ | title=Crew Picture The Great Mouse Detective | work=Drawn2gether | date=2008-03-24 | accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name="lat19860629">{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-29/entertainment/ca-22_1_big-cheese | title=Mousechievious Memo Upsets Big Cheese | work=Los Angeles Times | date=1986-06-29 | accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Reception==
The film was well-received by critics during its initial release, including a "two thumbs up" rating from critics [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel and Ebert]].<ref>{{cite episode | title=Review of ''The Great Mouse Detective'' | series=[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel & Ebert]] | airdate=February 1992 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | network= Syndication ([[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]])}}</ref> The film also maintains a 80% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 15 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/adventures_of_the_great_mouse_detective/ | title=Reviews for ''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective'' | publisher=[[Flixster]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>  London's [[Time Out (company)|''Time Out'']] magazine wrote, "As usual with [[film noir]] [...] it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben."<ref>{{cite book|last=Peachment|first=Chris|editor-last=Pym|editor-first=John|title=Time Out Film Guide 2009|edition=17th|chapter=The Great Mouse Detective (aka Basil the Great Mouse Detective)|page=426|isbn=978-1-84760-100-9{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (9) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}|year=2008|accessdate=November 9, 2010|publisher=Time Out Group Ltd}}</ref>

This film did fairly well at the box office, garnering around $38,625,550<ref name="box office" /> over a budget of $14 million during its initial release. Its moderate success after its predecessor's failure gave the new management of Disney confidence in the viability of their animation department. This led to creation of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released three years later, which signaled a [[Disney Renaissance|renaissance]] for the company.

After a re-release in February 1992, the film was released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] in July 1992 as part of the [[Walt Disney Classics]] series. It was released again on VHS in August 1999 (with a game sheet inside it as part of a contest) and on [[DVD]] in 2002 with a short making-of featurette.

A new "Mystery in the Mist Edition" DVD of ''The Great Mouse Detective'' was released on April 13, 2010. Unlike previous home video releases, which all used the 1992 reissue title print (''The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective''), this DVD restored the original 1986 title card, which had previously not been seen since the original 1986 release. The DVD also has the film in 1.78:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] Widescreen revealing more picture, bringing it closer to its original theatrical aspect ratio. This edition has not been released in Europe. A release of the movie on [[Blu-ray Disc]] is set for October 9, 2012.

==Soundtrack==
*'''"The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"''', Music by [[Henry Mancini]], Lyrics by [[Larry_Grossman_(composer)|Larry Grossman]] and [[Ellen Fitzhugh]], Performed by [[Vincent Price]].
*'''"Let Me Be Good To You"''', Music, Lyrics and Performed by [[Melissa Manchester]].
*'''"Goodbye So Soon"''', Music by Henry Mancini, Lyrics by Larry Grossman and Ellen Fitzhugh, Performed by Vincent Price.
