The use of '''horses in World War I''' reflected a transitional period in the evolution of armed conflict. [[Cavalry]] units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but over the course of the war, the vulnerability of the horse to modern machine gun and artillery fire fostered interest in mechanized forces. This paralleled the development of [[tank]]s that would ultimately replace cavalry in [[shock tactics]]. While the perceived value of the [[horses in warfare|horse in war]] changed dramatically,  horses nonetheless played a significant role throughout the war.

All of the major combatants in [[World War I]] (1914<U+2013>1918) began the conflict with cavalry forces. Germany and Austria<U+2013>Hungary stopped using them on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] soon after the war began, but they continued to be deployed in a limited fashion on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] well into the war. On the [[Allied]] side, the United Kingdom used mounted infantry and [[Charge (warfare)|cavalry charges]] throughout the war, but the United States used cavalry for only a short time. Although not particularly successful on the Western Front, Allied cavalry did have some success in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]], possibly in part due to facing a weaker and less technologically advanced enemy. The [[Ottoman Empire]] used cavalry extensively during the war. Russia used cavalry forces on the Eastern Front, but with limited success.

Horses were used by the military mainly for logistical support during the war; they were better than mechanized vehicles at travelling through deep mud and over rough terrain. They were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling [[artillery]], ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but they also contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their manure and carcasses. The value of horses, and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 it was made known to some troops that the loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the Allied blockade prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat.   By the end of the war, even the well supplied American army was lacking horses.

Conditions were severe for horses at the front; they were killed by artillery fire, suffered from skin disorders, and were injured by [[poison gas]]. Hundreds of thousands of horses died, and many more were treated at veterinary hospitals and sent back to the front. Procuring equine food was a major issue, and Germany lost many horses to starvation through lack of [[fodder]]. Several memorials have been erected to commemorate the horses which died. Artists, including [[Alfred Munnings]], extensively documented the work of horses in the war and horses featured in war poetry. Novels, plays and documentaries have also featured the horses of World War I.

Many British tacticians outside of the cavalry units realized before the war that advances in technology meant that the era of mounted warfare was coming to an end. However, many senior cavalry men disagreed, and cavalry regiments remained at the ready throughout the war, despite their limited usefulness. Scarce wartime resources were used to train and maintain cavalry regiments that were rarely used, and the continued use of the cavalry charge as a tactical maneuver resulted in the loss of many troops and horses in fruitless attacks against enemy machine guns.<ref>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 174<U+2013>176</ref> 

Early in the war, cavalry skirmishes occurred on several fronts, and horse-mounted troops were widely used for reconnaissance.<ref name>Willmott, ''First World War'', p. 46</ref> Britain's cavalry were trained to fight both on foot and mounted, but most other European cavalry still relied on the [[shock tactics|shock tactic]] of mounted charges. There were isolated instances of successful shock combat on the Western Front, where cavalry divisions also provided important mobile fire-power.<ref name="MH188" /> Beginning in 1917, cavalry was deployed alongside tanks and aircraft, notably at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], where cavalry was expected to exploit breakthroughs in the lines that the slower tanks could not. However, this plan never came to fruition due to missed opportunities and the use of machine guns by German forces.  At Cambrai, troops from Great Britain, Canada, India and Germany participated in mounted actions.<ref>Hammond, ''Cambrai 1917'', pp. 69, 450<U+2013>451</ref> Cavalry was still deployed late in the war, with Allied cavalry troops harassing retreating German forces in 1918 during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], when horses and tanks continued to be used in the same battles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/photo-e.aspx?PageId=3.D.2&photo=3.D.2.af&f=%2fcwm%2fexhibitions%2fguerre%2fofficial-art-e.aspx|title=Cavalry and Tanks at Arras, 1918|publisher=Canadian War Museum|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref> In comparison to their limited usefulness on the Western Front, "cavalry was literally indispensable" on the Eastern front and in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]].<ref name="MH188" />

Great changes in the tactical use of cavalry were a marked feature of World War I, as improved weaponry rendered frontal charges ineffective. Although cavalry was used with good effect in [[Palestine]], at the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] and [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], generally the mode of warfare changed. Tanks were beginning to take over the role of shock combat.<ref name="Carver123" /> The use of [[trench warfare]], barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete.<ref name="Carver123">Carver, ''Britain's Army in the 20th Century'', p. 123</ref> Following the war, the armies of the world powers initiated a process of mechanization in earnest, and most cavalry regiments were either converted to mechanized units or disbanded.<ref>Carver, ''Britain's Army in the 20th Century'', pp. 154<U+2013>57</ref> Historian G.J. Meyer writes that "the Great War brought the end of cavalry".<ref name=Meyer264>Meyer, ''A World Undone, p. 264</ref> From the [[Middle Ages]] into the 20th century, cavalry had dominated battlefields, but from as early as the [[American Civil War]] it had been apparent that their value in war was declining as artillery became more powerful, reducing the effectiveness of shock charges. The Western Front in World War I made it clear that cavalry was almost useless against modern weaponry, and it also reinforced the fact that they were difficult to transport and supply. Nonetheless, British cavalry officers, far more than their continental European counterparts, persisted in using and maintaining cavalry, believing that mounted troops would be useful for exploiting infantry breakthroughs, and under the right circumstances would be able to face machine guns. However, neither of these beliefs proved correct.<ref name=Meyer264/>

Campbell obeyed his orders to charge, although he believed the more prudent course of action would have been to fight dismounted. The charge resulted in a British loss of 250&nbsp;men and 300&nbsp;horses.

Despite their lackluster record in Europe, horses proved indispensable to the British war effort in Palestine, particularly under Field Marshal [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]], for whom cavalry made up a large percentage of his forces.  Most of his mounted troops were not British regular cavalry, but the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], consisting of a combination of Australian, New Zealand, Indian units and English<!-- They really were all from England, not elsewhere in the UK --> [[Yeomanry]] regiments from the [[Territorial Force]], largely equipped as [[mounted infantry]] rather than cavalry.<ref name=Ellis176-7/> By mid-1918, Turkish intelligence estimated that Allenby commanded around 11,000 cavalry.<ref name=Erickson195>Erickson, ''Ordered to Die'', pp. 195<U+2013>197</ref> Allenby's forces crushed the Turkish armies in a running series of battles that included the extensive use of cavalry by both sides.

Indian cavalry participated in actions on both the Western and Palestinian fronts throughout the war.

====Canada====

When the war began, [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]], a Canadian cavalry regiment, was mobilized and sent to England for training. The regiment served as infantry in French trenches during 1915, and were not returned to their mounted status until February 16, 1916. In the defense of the [[Somme]] front in March 1917, mounted troops saw action, and Lieutenant [[Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey|Frederick Harvey]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions. Canadian cavalry generally had the same difficulties as other nations in breaking trench warfare deadlocks and were of little use on the front lines. However, in the spring of 1918, Canadian cavalry was essential in halting the last major German offensive of the war.<ref name=Dube>{{cite web|url= http://www.strathconas.ca/index2.php?subaction=showfull&id=1272646401&archive=&start_from=&ucat=&|title=Strathconas Celebrate the Battle of Moreuil Wood|author=MCpl Mathieu Dub<U+00E9>|date=

[[File:Light horse walers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Australian Imperial Force]] light horsemen, 1914|alt=Two men carrying rifles on horseback; another horse and rider are partially visible in the background.]]

The [[Anzac Mounted Division]] formed in Egypt in 1916 and was composed of four [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) mounted brigades from the [[Australian Light Horse]] and the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]].  All had fought at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] as infantry. Members of the division engaged Turkish troops at the [[Suez Canal]] in mid-1916 and captured major Turkish strongholds at [[Battle of Magdhaba|Magdhaba]] and [[Battle of Rafa|Rafah]] in early 1917. They participated in the [[First Battle of Gaza|First]], [[Second Battle of Gaza|Second]] and [[Third Battle of Gaza|Third]] Battles of Gaza in 1917, and in 1918 conducted raids across the [[Jordan River]], assisted in the capture of [[Amman]] (capturing 10,300&nbsp;prisoners in nine days), and reoccupied Gallipoli in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8888/index.html|title=Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division|accessdate=2010-04-06|publisher=University of New South Wales, Australian Defence Force Academy}}</ref>  

The division carried rifles, bayonets and machine guns, generally using horses as swift transport and dismounting to fight.<ref>Pugsley, ''The Anzac Experience'', p. 119</ref> Units were as small as four men, with three fighting while the fourth held the horses.<ref name=ALH>{{cite web|title=Walers: horses used in the First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2009-12-29|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/horses/index.asp}}</ref> Sometimes they fought as mounted troops:  at the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] in 1917, the Australian [[4th Light Horse Brigade]] made what is sometimes called "the last successful cavalry charge in history", when two regiments successfully overran Turkish trenches.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Australian War Memorial|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/event_138.asp |title=Attack on Beersheba|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>  They formed up over a wide area, to avoid offering a target for enemy artillery, and galloped {{convert|3|km|mi}} into machine gun fire, equipped only with rifles and bayonets.

Before the war began, many continental European armies still considered the cavalry to hold a vital place in their order of battle. France and Russia expanded their mounted military units before 1914.  Of the Central Powers, Germany added thirteen regiments of mounted riflemen, Austria<U+2013>Hungary expanded their forces,<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 20</ref> and the Bulgarian army also readied the cavalry in their army.<ref>Erickson, ''Ordered to Die'', p. 144</ref>

French cavalry had similar problems with horses on the Western Front as the British,<ref name=Ellis176/> although the treatment of their horses created additional difficulties.  Opinion generally was that the French were poor horsemen: "The French cavalryman of 1914 sat on his horse beautifully, but was no horsemaster. It did not occur to him to get off his horse's back whenever he could, so there were thousands of animals with sore backs&nbsp;...".<ref name=Herwig261/> One French general, [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Sordet]], was accused of not letting horses have access to water in hot weather.<ref name=Herwig261>Herwig, ''The Marne, 1914'', p. 261</ref>{{#tag:ref|By September 1914, with battered men and horses, having abandoned a crucial position in the [[First Battle of the Marne]], Sordet was relieved of his command.<ref name=Herwig261/>|group=note}} By late August 1914, a sixth of the horses in the French cavalry were unusable.<ref>Jarymowycz, ''Cavalry from hoof to track'', pp. 137<U+2013>138</ref>  The French continued to eschew mounted warfare when in a June 1918 charge by French lancers the horses were left behind and the men charged on foot.<ref name=Ellis176/>

Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry divisions when it entered the war in 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep into the heart of Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], troops led by German Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and Lieutenant-General [[Erich Ludendorff]] surrounded the Russian [[Second Army (Russian Empire)|Second Army]] and destroyed the mounted force of [[Don Cossacks]] that served as the special guard of Russian General [[Alexander Samsonov]].<ref name=Ellis177/> Other Russian cavalry units successfully harassed retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000&nbsp;men in the Austro-Hungarian [[XIV Tyrolean Corps]], which included the [[6th Mounted Rifle Regiment]].<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 161</ref> Transporting cavalry created a hardship for the already strained Russian infrastructure, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that they had to be transported by train. Approximately the same number of trains (about 40) were required to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as to transport an infantry division of 16,000.<ref name=Ellis177>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp.177<U+2013>178</ref>

The cavalries of the Central Powers, Germany and Austria<U+2013>Hungary, faced the same problems with transport and the failure of tactics as the Russians.<ref name=Ellis178>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', p. 178</ref> Germany initially made extensive use of cavalry, including a lance-against-lance battle with the British in late 1914,<ref name=Campbell/> and an engagement between the British [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Brigade]] and the German [[4th Cavalry Division]] in the lead-up to the [[First Battle of the Marne]] in September 1914. That battle ended "decidedly to the disadvantages of the German cavalry", partially due to the use of artillery by the accompanying British [[L (N<U+00E9>ry) Battery Royal Horse Artillery|L Battery]] of [[horse artillery]].<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 107</ref> The Germans stopped using cavalry on the Western Front not long after the beginning of the war, in response to the Allied Forces' changing battle tactics, including more advanced weaponry.<ref name=Ellis178/> They continued to use cavalry to some extent on the Eastern Front, including probes into Russian territory in early 1915.<ref>Meyer, ''A World Undone'', p. 321</ref> The Austrians were forced to stop using cavalry because of large-scale equipment failures; Austrian military saddles were so poorly designed as to rub the skin off the [[back (horse)|back]] of any horse not already hardened to the equipment from parade ground practice; only a few weeks into the war half of all Austrian cavalry mounts were disabled, and the rest nearly so.<ref name=Ellis178/>

In 1914, the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Turks]] began the war with one cavalry regiment in the [[Turkish Army|Turkish army corps]] and four reserve regiments (originally formed in 1912) under the control of the [[Turkish Third Army]]. These reserve regiments were composed of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], rural Turks and a few Armenians.<ref>Erickson, ''Ordered to Die'', pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref> The performance of the reserve divisions was poor, and in March 1915 the forces that survived were turned into two divisions totalling only two thousand men and seventy officers. Later that month, the best regiments were consolidated into one division and the rest disbanded. Nonetheless, cavalry was used by Ottoman forces throughout 1915 in engagements with the Russians,<ref>Erickson, ''Ordered to Die'', pp. 64, 105<U+2013>107</ref> and one cavalry unit even exchanged small arms fire with a submarine crew in the [[Dardanelles]] in early 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_8/daring_dardanelles.html|title=Daring the Dardanelles: British Submarines in the Sea of Marmara During World War I|author=Whitman, Edward C.|accessdate=2010-02-20|journal=Undersea Warfare|date=Summer 2000|vol=2|number=4}}</ref> Turkish cavalry was used in engagements with the British, including the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] in late 1917. In this battle, both sides used cavalry forces as strategic parts of their armies.<ref>Erickson, ''Ordered to Die'', pp. 172<U+2013>174</ref> Cavalry continued to be involved in engagements well into 1918, including in [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)#Situation from the fall of Jerusalem to September 1918|conflicts near the Jordan River]] in April and May that year, which the Ottomans called the First and Second Battles of Jordan, part of the lead-up to the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]].  By September 1918, regular army cavalry forces were stationed throughout the Turkish front, and the only remaining operationally ready reserve forces in the Ottoman military were two cavalry divisions, one formed after the initial problems in 1915.<ref name=Erickson195/>

=== United States ===

[[File:Gasmask for man and horse.jpeg|thumb|left|An American soldier demonstrating a gas mask for his horse|alt=A man wearing a gas mask and helmet stands next to a tacked up horse wearing a gas mask.|upright=.75]]

By 1916, the United States Cavalry consisted of 15,424&nbsp;members organized into 15&nbsp;regiments, including headquarters, supply, machine-gun and rifle troops.<ref>Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry'', pp. 174<U+2013>176</ref> Just before formally joining the war effort, the US had gained significant experience in 1916 and 1917 during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] in Mexico, which helped to prepare the US Cavalry for entry into World War I. In May 1917, a month after the US declaration of war, the [[National Defense Act of 1916|National Defense Act]] went into effect, creating the 18th through the 25th US Cavalry regiments, and later that month, twenty more cavalry regiments were created. However, British experiences during the first years of the war showed that trench warfare and weapons that included machine guns and artillery made cavalry warfare impractical. Thus, on October 1, eight of the new cavalry regiments were converted to field artillery regiments by order of Congress, and by August 1918, twenty [[National Army (USA)|National Army]] horse units were converted to thirty-nine trench mortar and artillery batteries. Some horse units of the [[2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment|2nd]], [[3d Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd]], [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th]] and [[15th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|15th]] Cavalry regiments accompanied the US forces in Europe. The soldiers worked mainly as [[groom (horses)|grooms]] and [[farrier]]s, attending to remounts for the artillery, medical corps and transport services. It was not until late August 1918 that US cavalry entered combat. A provisional squadron of 418&nbsp;officers and enlisted men, representing the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and mounted on convalescent horses, was created to serve as scouts and couriers during the [[St. Mihiel Offensive]]. On September 11, 1918, these troops rode at night through [[no man's land]] and penetrated five miles behind German lines. Once there, the cavalry was routed and had to return to Allied territory. Despite serving through the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], by mid-October the squadron was removed from the front with only 150 of its men remaining.<ref>Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry'', pp. 179<U+2013>180</ref>

Horses were used to pull ambulances, carry supplies and [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]], and act as cavalry mounts.  At the beginning of the war, the German army depended upon horses to pull its field kitchens, as well as the ammunition wagons for artillery brigades.<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 77</ref> The [[Royal Corps of Signals]] used horses to pull cable wagons, and the promptness of messengers and [[Despatch rider|dispatch riders]] depended on their mounts.   Horses often drew artillery and steady animals were crucial to artillery effectiveness.<ref name=Animals/> The deep mud common in some parts of the front, caused by damaged drainage systems flooding nearby areas, made horses vital, as they were the only means of getting supplies to the front and guns moved from place to place.  Dummy horses were sometimes used to deceive the enemy into misreading the location of troops.<ref name=Animals53/> They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lighthorse.org.au/resources/military-stories-ww1/the-mounted-soldiers-of-australia|title=The Mounted Soldiers of Australia|publisher=The Australian Light Horse Association|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/palestine-campaign/battle-of-megiddo|title=Battle of Megiddo <U+2013> Palestine campaign|publisher=History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

Thousands of horses were employed to pull field guns; six to twelve horses were required to pull each gun.<ref name=Animals53/>  During the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], horses were used to recover guns captured by the British from no man's land. In one instance, two teams of sixteen horses each had their [[horse hoof|hooves]], tack and pulling chains wrapped to reduce noise. The teams and their handlers then successfully pulled out two guns and returned them to British lines, the horses jumping a trench in the process and waiting out an artillery barrage by German troops on the road they needed to take.<ref>Hammond, ''Cambrai 1917'', pp. 425<U+2013>426</ref>

Horses and mules assisted in moving ammunition and other supplies by wagon in bad conditions.<ref name=Animals/><ref name=Meyer531/> After the April 1917 [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], one Canadian soldier recalled, "the horses were up to their bellies in mud.

To meet its need for horses, Britain imported them from Australia, Canada, the USA, and Argentina, and requisitioned them from British civilians. [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] ordered that no horses under {{hands|15}} should be confiscated, at the request of many British children, who were concerned for the welfare of their [[pony|ponies]]. The British [[Remount Service]], in an effort to improve the supply of horses for potential military use, provided the services of high quality [[stallion]]s to British farmers for breeding their [[mare|broodmares]].<ref name=Animals53>Schafer, "Animals, Use of" in ''The European Powers in the First World War'', p. 53</ref> The already rare [[Cleveland Bay]] was almost wiped out by the war; smaller members of the breed were used to carry British troopers, while larger horses were used to pull [[artillery]].<ref name=Dent61/> New Zealand found that horses over {{hands|15.2}} fared worse than those under that height. Well-built [[Thoroughbred]]s of 15&nbsp;hands and under worked well, as did compact horses of other breeds that stood {{hands|14.2|to|14.3}}. Larger [[crossbred]] horses were acceptable for regular work with plentiful rations, but proved less able to withstand short rations and long journeys. Riflemen with tall horses suffered more from fatigue<!--does the source really make this conclusion? if so, OK-->, due to the number of times they were required to mount and dismount the animals. Animals used for draught work, including pulling artillery, were also found to be more efficient when they were of medium size with good endurance than when they were tall, heavy and long-legged.<ref>Reakes, ''The War Effort of New Zealand'', p. 159</ref>

The continued resupply of horses was a major issue of the war. One estimate puts the number of horses that served in World War I at around six million, with a large percentage of them dying due to war-related causes.<ref name=IMH/> In 1914, estimates put Britain's horse population at between 20,000 and 25,000. This shortfall required the US to help with remount efforts, even before it had formally entered the war.<ref name=IMH/><ref name=PP>{{cite journal|journal=Past & Present|title=Britain's military use of horses 1914<U+2013>1918|date=May 1993|author=Singleton, John|pages=178<U+2013>204}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, and another 182,000 were taken overseas with American troops.  This deployment seriously depleted the country's equine population. Only 200 returned to the US, and 60,000 were killed outright.<ref name=IMH/> By the middle of 1917, Britain had procured 591,000 horses and 213,000&nbsp;mules, as well as almost 60,000&nbsp;camels and oxen. Britain's Remount Department spent <U+00A3>67.5&nbsp;million on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. The British Remount Department became a major multinational business and a leading player in the international horse trade, through supplying horses to not only the British Army but also to Canada, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and even a few to the US. Shipping horses between the US and Europe was both costly and dangerous; [[American Expeditionary Force]] officials calculated that almost seven times as much room was needed per ton for animals than for average wartime cargo, and over 6,500&nbsp;horses and mules were drowned or killed by shell fire on Allied ships attacked by the Germans.<ref name=PP/> In turn, New Zealand lost around 3&nbsp;percent of the nearly 10,000&nbsp;horses shipped to the front during the war.<ref>Reakes, ''The War Effort of New Zealand'', p. 154</ref>

Due to the high casualty rates, even the well-supplied American army was facing a deficit of horses by the final year of the war. After the [[First United States Army|American First Army]], led by General [[John J. Pershing]], pushed the Germans out of the [[Argonne Forest]] in late 1918, they were faced with a shortage of around 100,000 horses, effectively immobilizing the artillery. When Pershing asked [[Ferdinand Foch]], [[Marshal of France]], for 25,000 horses, he was refused. It was impossible to obtain more from the US, as shipping space was limited, and Pershing's senior supply officer stated that "the animal situation will soon become desperate." The Americans, however, fought on with what they had until the end of the war, unable to obtain sufficient supplies of new animals.<ref>Gilbert, ''The First World War'', pp. 477<U+2013>479</ref>

=== Central Powers ===

Before World War I, Germany had increased its reserves of horses through state-sponsored [[stud farm]]s and annuities paid to individual horse breeders. These breeding programs were designed specifically to provide high-quality horses and mules for the German military. These efforts, and the horse-intensive nature of warfare in the early 20th century, caused Germany to increase the ratio of horses to men in the army, from one to four in 1870 to one to three in 1914. The breeding programs allowed the Germans to provide all of their own horses at the beginning of the war.<ref name=PP/>  Horses were considered army reservists; owners had to register them regularly, and the army kept detailed records on the locations of all horses. In the first weeks of the war, the German army mobilized 715,000&nbsp;horses and the Austrians 600,000. Overall, the ratio of horses to men in Central Powers nations was estimated at one to three.<ref name=Keegan73>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 73</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Russian military topped both Germany and Austria by gathering over a million horses in August 1914.<ref name=Keegan73/>|group=note}}

The only way Germany could acquire large numbers of horses after the war began was by conquest. More than 375,000&nbsp;horses were taken from German-occupied French territory for use by the German military. Captured Ukrainian territory provided another 140,000.<ref name=PP/> The [[Ardennes (horse)|Ardennes]] was used to pull artillery for the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse.<ref name=Pinney>Pinney, ''The Working Horse Manual'', pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the [[Belgian (horse)|Brabant]].<ref name=Animals>Schafer, "Animals, Use of" in ''The European Powers in the First World War'', p. 52</ref> The Germans were not able to capture the horses belonging to the Belgian royal family, as they were successfully evacuated, although they captured enough horses to disrupt Belgian agriculture and breeding programs. Horses used for the transport of goods were also taken, resulting in a fuel crisis in Belgium the next winter as there were no horses to pull coal wagons. The Germans sold some of their captured horses at auction.<ref>Schafer, "Animals, Use of" in ''The European Powers in the First World War'', pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref> Prevented by the Allies from importing remounts, the Germans ultimately ran out of horses, making it difficult for them to move supplies and artillery, a contributing factor to their defeat.<ref name=Animals53/>

== Casualties and upkeep ==
[[File:WWI horse skin disease.jpg|thumb|right|A horse undergoes treatment for a skin disease at a British veterinary hospital in 1916]]
Battle losses of horses were approximately 25&nbsp;percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion accounted for the remainder<ref name=PP/> and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire.<ref name=DailyMail/> The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the [[tsetse fly]].{{#tag:ref|This number was higher than 100&nbsp;percent because additional horses were requisitioned and sent to the front, where they had a high attrition rate.|group=note}} On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the [[Crimean War]], 120 percent in the [[Boer War]] and 10 percent in peacetime.<ref name=PP/> During some periods of the war, 1,000&nbsp;horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe.<ref name=DailyMail/> Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 [[Battle of Verdun]] between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun.<ref>Gilbert, ''The First World War'', p. 235</ref> By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the [[Clydesdale horse]]s, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over the course of the war, Britain lost over 484,000&nbsp;horses, one horse for every two men.<ref name="MH417">Holmes, ''Military History'', p. 417</ref>

Feeding horses was a major issue, and horse [[fodder]] was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries,<ref>Keegan, ''A History of Warfare,'' p. 308</ref> including Britain.<ref>Holmes, ''Tommy'', p. 163</ref> Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated the amount of food they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.<ref name=PP/>

Animals bolstered morale at the front, due to the soldiers' affection for them.<ref name=Animals/> Some recruitment posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits.<ref name=Animals53/> Despite the boost in morale, horses could also be a health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, and was especially noted in camps in Egypt.<ref>Stout, ''War Surgery and Medicine'', p. 479</ref> Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.<ref>Carbery, ''The New Zealand Medical Service in the Great War 1914<U+2013>1918'', p. 223</ref>

Many horses died as a result of the conditions at the front<U+2014>of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, [[poison gas]] attacks that injured their [[respiratory system of the horse|respiratory systems]] and skin, and skin conditions such as [[mange]]. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks.<ref name=Animals53/> Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/objects/display.aspx?id=5159|title=Gas mask for horses, Germany, 1914<U+2013>1918|publisher=Science Museum, London|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9404E1DB163EE433A25752C0A9609C946996D6CF|title=Gas Masks for Horses; Improved Device Being Made for American Army|accessdate=2010-01-13|journal=New York Times|date=June 1, 1918 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the [[Western Front]].<ref name=Animals53/> In one year, 120,000&nbsp;horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and [[horse trailer]]s were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances.<ref name=IMH>{{cite web|url=http://www.imh.org/history.php?chapter=100|title=1900: The Horse in Transition|publisher=International Museum of the Horse|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref> Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with [[Equine influenza]], [[ringworm]], [[colic|sand colic]], sores from fly bites, and [[anthrax]] among the illnesses that affected them.<ref>Reakes, ''The War Effort of New Zealand'', pp. 155<U+2013>157</ref> 

When the war ended, many horses were killed due to age or illness, while younger ones were sold to [[horse slaughter|slaughterhouses]] or to locals, often upsetting the soldiers who had to give up their beloved mounts.<ref name=Animals53/> There were 13,000 Australian horses remaining at the end of World War I, but due to quarantine restrictions, they could not be shipped back to Australia. Two thousand were designated to be killed, and the remaining 11,000 were sold, most going to India as remounts for the British Army.<ref name=ALH/> Of the 136,000&nbsp;horses shipped from Australia to fighting fronts in the war, only one, Sandy, was returned to Australia.<ref name=Sandy>{{cite web|title=Sandy: The only horse to return from the First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/horses/sandy.asp|accessdate=2009-12-28}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Sandy was the horse of Sir William Bridges, a Major General killed at Gallipoli.
