'''An<U+00E1>rion''' is a fictional character in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]], born S.A. 3219 and killed S.A. 3440 (lived 221 years). His name is apparently derived from ''[[Sun (Middle-earth)|Anar]]'', the [[Quenya]] name for the Sun.

He was the second son of [[Elendil]] and the brother of [[Isildur]]. His son [[Meneldil]] was the last man born in [[N<U+00FA>menor]] before the [[Akallab<U+00EA>th]]. Together with his father and brother, An<U+00E1>rion was a leader of the ''[[Elendilli]]'' or ''Faithful'', the part of the N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean people that opposed the dark rule of king [[Ar-Pharaz<U+00F4>n]] and [[Sauron]].

After the downfall Elendil landed in the north near the Elven realm of [[Lindon]], and there established the realm of [[Arnor]], but Isildur and An<U+00E1>rion landed in the south of Middle-earth, establishing the realm of Gondor. Both realms were founded on existing N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean colonies: Gondor grew out of the already established city of [[Pelargir]], and the existing Princedom of [[Belfalas]] (later renamed [[Dol Amroth]]).

An<U+00E1>rion was chiefly responsible for the early ordering of Gondor: he founded the cities of [[Minas Anor]] and [[Minas Ithil]], as well as the bridge and city of [[Osgiliath]]. Osgiliath was dedicated to the stars, but also after Elendil. Minas Anor and the outlying region of [[An<U+00F3>rien]] were named after the Sun, but also after An<U+00E1>rion. Minas Ithil and [[Ithilien]] across the river [[Anduin]] were named after the [[Moon (Middle-earth)|Moon]], and Isildur.

Gondor was soon attacked by a returned Sauron and Minas Ithil was captured, driving Isildur out. In the War of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] An<U+00E1>rion defended Gondor and its people, ruling as its regent, while his brother escaped north to join up with Elendil and the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]]. Defending a land under siege, he successfully defended the N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean exiles, the earlier settlers, and the indigenous population of Gondor for a time. His forces held Osgiliath and drove Sauron back to the mountains for a time, though An<U+00E1>rion was wise enough to forsee that Gondor would not stand unless Elendil arrived. 

When Elendil, Isildur and [[Gil-galad]] arrived, they summoned him to take part in the campaign into [[Mordor]]. He fought with distinction in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and in the Siege of [[Barad-d<U+00FB>r]], but was slain in S.A. 3340 by a stone hurled from the Dark Tower. The crown of Minas Arnor, An<U+00E1>rion's helm, was crushed when he was slain. Isildur later handed over his (plain) helm to be used as the replacement crown. Several generations later, Isildur's helm was replaced by an elaborate jeweled helm. 

An<U+00E1>rion had four children; the first three were all apparently daughters<ref>Although nowhere specifically stated, An<U+00E1>rion's three older children were most likely daughters, as Meneldil received the throne of Gondor. Under the Elendilli the law of cognatic primogeniture apparently did not exist, or an older sister of Meneldil would have earned the crown instead.</ref>, but the fourth child was a son, Meneldil.

Although his line was originally not destined to rule, his son Meneldil became King of Gondor, as Isildur's heirs only ruled over Arnor. Isildur is not recorded as having given up his rights over Gondor, and it appears that the Line of An<U+00E1>rion thus came to rule illegally.

On the other hand, the title 'High King' remained with the northern line, and even as Gondor grew more mighty than Arnor it remained the younger line. The Line of An<U+00E1>rion slowly dwindled and disappeared over time, until in the end the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Stewards]] denounced the right of any heir of An<U+00E1>rion to ever reclaim the throne, as no one with "pure blood" could be found. 

Though not known to the majority of the populance of Gondor, the bloodlines of An<U+00E1>rion and Isildur were reunited when An<U+00E1>rion's female descendant, Princess [[F<U+00ED>riel]] of Gondor, married Isildur's descendant Prince [[Arvedui]] of Arnor. This eventually opened the path for [[Aragorn II]] to in time become king of the [[Reunited Kingdom]].
