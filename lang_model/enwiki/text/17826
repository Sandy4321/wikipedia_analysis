"'''Venus'''" is a song  by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]] for her third [[studio album]], ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013); it appears as the second track on the album. It was written by Gaga, along with Paul "DJ White Shadow" Blair, Hugo Leclercq, Dino Zisis, Nick Monson, and [[Sun Ra]], and produced by Gaga herself. Originally intended as the second single from the album, it was released as the first promotional single from it on October 28, 2013 on [[iTunes Store]], after the positive reception of "[[Do What U Want]]", which was planned to be a promotional single only.

"Venus" is a [[dance-pop]] song with four [[Hook (music)|hooks]], which lyrically presents Gaga as the goddess of love, from [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]''. It also name-checks the planets in the solar system. The singer had been promoting "Venus" before its release, by tweeting its lyrics, also as part of a countdown for the release of ''Artpop''. Three different artworks were done by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]], including one with a scorpion attached to her head, a picture of a dead bat and a third seeing her standing naked with a open clam shell superimposed above her shoulder and covering her lower face. The artworks attained a mixed reaction from critics, who deemed them as "weird" or "striking".

Upon its release, "Venus" received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who called the song catchy, but preferred the previously released "Do What U Want", and had mixed feelings towards the lyrics. It attainted moderated success on charts around the world, peaking within the top-forty in Australia, Germany and the United States, while reaching the top three in Finland and Spain. Gaga has performed the song on the [[The X Factor (UK series 10)|tenth series]] of [[The X Factor (UK TV series)|''The X Factor'' (UK)]], along with a suggestive performance of "Do What U Want", which prompted complaints to the broadcaster and British media regulator, [[Ofcom]], due to Gaga's costume, performance and suggestive lyrics, which was broadcast before the [[Watershed (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|9pm watershed]].
