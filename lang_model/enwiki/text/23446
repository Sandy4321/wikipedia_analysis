==History==

===Birmingham Medical School===
[[File:bbuilding.jpg|thumb|A view across Chancellor's Court, towards the Law building]]

Although the earliest beginnings of the University were previously traced back to the [[University of Birmingham Medical School|Birmingham Medical School]] which is linked to [[William Sands Cox]] in his aim of creating a medical school along strictly Christian lines, unlike the London medical schools, further research has now revealed the roots of the [[Birmingham Medical School]] in the medical education seminars of Mr John Tomlinson the first surgeon to the [[Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary]], and later to the General Hospital. These classes were the first ever held outside London or south of the Scottish border in the winter of 1767<U+2013>68. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical and surgical apprentices at the General Hospital, opened in 1779.<ref name="medicine.bham.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.bham.ac.uk/histmed/history.shtml#TheBeginning |title=History of Medicine Unit <U+2013> University of Birmingham |publisher=Medicine.bham.ac.uk }}</ref> The medical school which grew out of the [[Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary]] was founded in 1828 but Cox began teaching in December 1825. Queen Victoria granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham and allowed it to be styled "The Queen's Hospital". It was the first provincial teaching hospital in England. In 1843, the medical college became known as Queen's College.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

=== Mason Science College ===
On 23 February 1875, Sir [[Josiah Mason]], the Birmingham [[industrialist]] and philanthropist, who made his fortune in making key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating, founded [[Mason Science College]]. It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham. In 1882, the Departments of [[Chemistry]], [[Botany]] and [[Physiology]] were transferred to Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of [[Physics]] and [[Comparative Anatomy]]. The transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a [[university college]] was made. As the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 it became incorporated as Mason University College on 1 January 1898, with the Right Honourable [[Joseph Chamberlain]] MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.

===Royal Charter===
[[File:Hallaston.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceiling of the Aston Webb building]]
It was largely due to Chamberlain's tireless enthusiasm that the university was granted a [[Royal Charter]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 24 March 1900. The [[Gough-Calthorpe family|Calthorpe family]] offered twenty-five acres (10 hectares) of land on the [[Bournbrook]] side of their estate in July. The Court of Governors received the Birmingham University Act 1900, which put the [[Royal Charter]] into effect, on 31 May. Birmingham was therefore arguably the first so-called [[red brick universities|red brick university]], although several other universities claim this title.

The transfer of Mason University College to the new University of Birmingham, with Chamberlain as its first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] and [[Oliver Lodge|Sir Oliver Lodge]] as the first [[Principal (university)|Principal]], was complete. All that remained of Josiah Mason's legacy was his Mermaid in the sinister chief of the university shield and of his college, the double-headed lion in the dexter.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It became the first civic and campus university in England. The University Charter of 1900 also included provision for a Faculty of Commerce, as was appropriate for a university itself founded by industrialists and based in a city with enormous business wealth, in effect creating the first Business School in England. Consequently, the faculty, the first of its kind in Britain, was founded by Sir [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]] in 1901, who from 1902 until 1923 served as first Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty. From 1905 to 1908, [[Edward Elgar]] held the position of Peyton Professor of Music at the university. He was succeeded by his friend [[Granville Bantock]].<ref name="Anderton">Keith Anderton, slevenotes, ''Bantock: Hebridean Symphony'', Naxos 8.555473, 1989</ref> The heritage archives of the University of Birmingham are accessible for research through the University's [http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/ Special Collections].

===Expansion===
[[File:BirminghamBarberInstitute.jpg|thumb|The [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]]]]
In 1939, the [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]], designed by [[Robert Atkinson (architect)|Robert Atkinson]], was opened. In 1956, the first MSc programme in [[Geotechnical Engineering]] commenced under the title of "Foundation Engineering", and has been run annually at the University of Birmingham since. It was the first geotechnical post-graduate school in England. The UK's longest-running MSc programme in Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors also started at the University of Birmingham in 1956, the same year that the world's first commercial nuclear power station was opened at Calder Hall in Cumbria. In 1957, Sir [[Hugh Casson]] and [[Neville Conder]] were asked by the university to prepare a masterplan on the site of the original 1900 buildings which were incomplete. The university drafted in other architects to amend the masterplan produced by the group. During the 1960s, the university constructed numerous large buildings, expanding the campus.<ref name="hickman"/> In 1963, the University of Birmingham helped in the establishment of the faculty of medicine at the University of Rhodesia, now the [[University of Zimbabwe]] (UZ). UZ is now independent but both institutions maintain relations through student exchange programmes.

Birmingham also supported the creation of [[Keele University|Keele]] (formerly University College of North Staffordshire) and [[University of Warwick|Warwick]] Universities under the Vice-Chancellorship of Sir Robert Aitken who acted as 'godfather' to the University of Warwick.<ref>Ives, 2000, p.342.</ref> The initial plan was to establish a satellite university college in [[Coventry]] but Aitken advised an independent initiative to the University Grants Committee.<ref>Ives, 2000, p.343.</ref>

===Achievements===
The university has been involved in many important inventions and developments in science. The [[cavity magnetron]] was developed at the university in the Physics Department by [[Sir John Randall|John Randall]], [[Harry Boot]] and [[James Sayers (physicist)|James Sayers]]. This was vital to the Allied victory in [[World War II]]. In 1940, the [[Frisch-Peierls memorandum]], a document which demonstrated that the [[atomic bomb]] was more than simply theoretically possible, was written in the Physics Department. The university also hosted early work on [[Gaseous diffusion]] in the Chemistry department when it was located in the Hills building. Many windows in the Aston Webb building overlooking the former fume cupboards were opaque from being attacked by [[hydrofluoric acid]] well into recent years.

In 1943, [[Mark Oliphant]] made an early proposal for the construction of a proton-[[synchrotron]], however he made no assurance that the machine would work. When phase stability was discovered in 1945, the proposal was resurrected and construction of a machine at the university that could surpass 1[[GeV]]. The university was aiming to construct the first machine to do this, however, funds were short and the machine did not start until 1953. They were beaten by the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], who managed to start their [[Cosmotron]] in 1952, and get it fully working in 1953, before the University of Birmingham.<ref>{{cite book |first=Laurie M. |last=Brown |coauthors=Max Dresden, Lillian Hoddeson |title=Pions to Quarks: Particle Physics in the 1950s: Based on a Fermilab Symposium |pages=167<U+2013>9 |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-30984-0}}</ref>

===Recent history===
The [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010#Prime Ministerial Debate - economic affairs|final round]] of the first ever [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010|televised leaders' debates]], hosted by the [[BBC]], was held at the university during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 British general election]] campaign on 29 April 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2010/04/Leaders_Debate_Press_Release.shtml|title=University of Birmingham to host final Prime Ministerial Debate|date=29 April 2010|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8652360.stm|title=Battleground ready for final prime-ministerial debate|date=29 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> It also acted as a training camp for the [[Jamaica]]n track and field team prior to the [[2012 London Olympics]].<ref name=Jamaica>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/8526811.stm|title=Jamaica's 2012 Olympics team plan Birmingham base|date=21 February 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>

On 9 August 2010 the University announced that for the first time it would not enter the [[Clearing system|UCAS clearing]] process for 2010 admission, which matches under-subscribed courses to students who did not meet their firm or insurance choices, due to all places being taken. Largely a result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010]], Birmingham joins fellow Russell Group universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol in not offering any clearing places.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10913471 |work=BBC News | title=Students face a scramble for university places | date=9 August 2010}}</ref>

In 2012 the University announced plans to build a new sports centre and library.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-education-news/2012/04/26/olympic-sized-swimming-pool-plan-at-university-of-birmingham-submitted-65233-30848924/|work=Birmingham Post | title=Olympic sized swimming pool plan at University of Birmingham | date= April 2012}}</ref>

===Controversies===
The discipline of [[cultural studies]] was founded at the University of Birmingham. Between 1991 and 2002, the campus was home to the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]], a leading research centre whose members' work came to be known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies. Despite being established by one of the key figures in the field, [[Richard Hoggart]], and being later directed by the renowned theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], the department was controversially closed down.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Melanie |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409096 |title=Poor staff relations threaten Birmingham's sociology department |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref>

Analysis showed that the University was fourth in a UK list of the Universities who faced the most Employment Tribunal Claims in the last three years. They were the second most likely to settle these before the hearing date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.academicfoi.com/tribunalsgagging/index.htm |title=Investigating UK Universities through Freedom of Information |publisher=AcademicFOI.Com }}</ref>

In 2011 a Parliamentary Early Day Motion was proposed arguing against the Guild suspending the elected Sabbatical Vice President (Education), who was arrested while taking part in protest activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2484 |title=Early day motion 2484 <U+2013> EDWARD BAUER, THE RIGHT TO PROTEST AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH <U+2013> UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk }}</ref>

In December 2011 it was announced that the University had obtained a 12-month long injunction<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/governance/policies-regs/activism.aspx |title=Activism on campus <U+2013> University of Birmingham |publisher=Birmingham.ac.uk }}</ref> against a group of around 25 students, who occupied a residential building on campus from the 23 to 26 November 2011, preventing them from engaging in further "occupational protest action" on the University's grounds without prior permission. It was misreported in the press that this injunction applied to all students, however the court order defines the defendants as: <blockquote>
Persons unknown (including students of the University of Birmingham) entering or remaining upon the buildings known as No. 2 Lodge Pritchatts Road, Birmingham at the University of Birmingham for the purpose of protest action (without the consent of the University of Birmingham) <ref>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/university/legal/activism/NO1.pdf</ref>
</blockquote> The University and the Guild of Students also clarified the scope of the injunction in an e-mail sent to all students on 11 January 2012, stating "The injunction applies only to those individuals who occupied the lodge".<ref>[https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Tt_gBUp6iyEuaV_rmGM1-T1LC4Hxo3anrJi8KRTxFQY ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

The University sought this injunction as a safety precaution based on previous occupations, although three separate human rights groups, including [[Amnesty International]], condemned the move as restrictive on human rights.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/dec/11/birmingham-university-protest-ban-condemned?INTCMP=SRCH |work=The Guardian | title=Birmingham University protest ban attacked as 'aggressive and censorious' | date=11 December 2011 | location=London | first=Shiv | last=Malik}}</ref>

==Campuses==

===Edgbaston campus===
[[File:BirminghamUniversityChancellorsCourt.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Aston Webb]] building, Chancellor's Court]]
The main campus of the university occupies a site some {{convert|3|mi|km}} south-west of [[Birmingham city centre]], in [[Edgbaston]]. It is arranged around [[Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower]] (affectionately known as 'Old Joe'), a grand [[campanile]] which commemorates the university's first chancellor, [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. The university's Great Hall is located in the domed [[Aston Webb]] Building, which is named after one of the architects <U+2013> the other was [[Ingress Bell]]. The initial {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} site was given to the university in 1900 by Lord Calthorpe. The grand buildings were an outcome of the <U+00A3>50,000 given by steel magnate and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] to establish a "first class modern scientific college"<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund Burke|title=The Annual Register|year=1900|publisher=Rivingtons|page=27|isbn=1-60030-829-5}}</ref> on the model of [[Cornell University]] in the United States.<ref>[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3164/11/002_10.pdf The Carnegie Committee], ''Cornell Alumni News'', II(10), 29 November 1899, p. 6</ref> Funding was also provided by Sir [[Holcroft Baronets|Charles Holcroft]].<ref>Ray Smallman, [http://www.eng.bham.ac.uk/metallurgy/news/RES%20-%20Hundred%20years%20of%20%20BUMS.pdf A hundred years of distinction], BUMS centenary lecture, p. 5</ref>

The original domed buildings, built in [[Accrington brick|Accrington red brick]], semicircle to form Chancellor's Court. This sits on a {{convert|30|ft|m}} drop, so the architects placed their buildings on two tiers with a {{convert|16|ft|m}} drop between them. The clock tower stands in the centre of the Court.

[[File:old joe.jpg|thumb|190px|upright|left|[[Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower|'Old Joe']]]]

The campanile itself draws its inspiration from the [[Torre del Mangia]], a medieval clock tower that forms part of the [[Palazzo Pubblico|Town Hall]] in [[Siena]], Italy.<ref>{{cite web|first=W.B.|last=Stephens|title=A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 7|year=1964|pages=43<U+2013>57|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22961}}</ref> When it was built, it was described as 'the intellectual beacon of the Midlands' by the ''Birmingham Post''. The clock tower was Birmingham's tallest building from the date of its construction in 1908 until 1969; it is now the third highest in the city. It is one of the top 50 tallest buildings in the UK,<ref name=50tallest>{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/snuk_list.htm |title=Britain's tallest 100 buildings by height|publisher=Skyscraper News |accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> and the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world,<ref name="CTBUH"/> although there is some confusion about its actual height, with the university listing it both as {{convert|110|m|ft|0}}<ref name=Tour>{{cite web|url=http://www.studyhere.bham.ac.uk/documents/B2362_Campus_tour_booklet_AW.pdf|title=Campus tour booklet|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> and {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} tall in different sources.<ref name="Trail">{{cite web|url=http://www.about.bham.ac.uk/centenary/heritagetrail/clocktower.shtml|title=Heritage trail: Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower, completed 1909|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>

The campus has a wide diversity in architectural types and architects. "What makes Birmingham so exceptional among the Red Brick universities is the deployment of so many other major Modernist practices: only Oxford and Cambridge boast greater selections".<ref>Foster, 2005, p.242-3.</ref>  The Guild of Students original section facing King Edward School was designed by Birmingham inter-war architect [[Holland W. Hobbiss|Holland Hobbiss]] who also designed the King Edward school opposite. It was described as "Redbrick Tudorish" by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].<ref>Braithwaite, 1987, p.20.</ref>

The statue on horseback fronting the entrance to the university and [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]] is a 1722 statue of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] rescued from Dublin in 1937.  This was saved by Bodkin, a director of the National Gallery of Ireland and first director of the Barber Institute.

Final negotiations for part of what is now the Vale were only completed in March 1947.  By then, properties which would have their names used for halls of residences such as Wyddrington and Maple Bank were under discussion and more land was obtained from the Calthorpe estate in 1948 and 1949 providing the setting for the Vale.<ref>Ives, 2000, p.304</ref>  Construction on the Vale started in 1962 with the creation of a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} artificial lake and the building of Ridge, High, Wyddrington and Lake Halls. The first, Ridge Hall, opened for 139 women in January 1964, with its counterpart High Hall (now Chamberlain Hall) admitting its first male residents the following October.<ref>Ives, 2000, p.338</ref>

====1960s and modern expansion====
[[File:Learning Center.jpg|thumb|right|The university's Learning Centre (left), School of Computer Science (right) and Faraday sculpture]]
The university underwent a major expansion in the 1960s due to the production of a masterplan by Casson, Conder and Partners. The first of the major buildings to be constructed to a design by the firm was the Refectory and Staff House which was built in 1961 and 1962. The two buildings are connected by a bridge. The next major buildings to be constructed were the Wyddrington and Lake Halls and the Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, all completed in 1965.  The Wyddrington and Lake Halls, on Edgbaston Park Road, were designed by [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and contained three floors of student dwellings above a single floor of communal facilities.

The Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, now known as the Ashley Building, was designed by Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and is a long, curving two-storey block linked to a five-storey [[Spiral|whorl]]. The two-storey block follows the curve of the road, and has load-bearing brick cross walls. It is faced in specially-made concrete blocks. The spiral is faced with faceted pre-cast concrete cladding panels.<ref name=hickman>{{cite book|author=Douglas Hickman|title=Birmingham|year=1970|publisher=Studio Vista Limited}}</ref> It was [[listed building|statutorily listed]] in 1993<ref name=STS /> and a refurbishment by [[Berman Guedes Stretton]] was completed in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgsarchitects.co.uk/clients/education/oubcss.htm|title=University of Birmingham: Faculty of Commerce and Social Science|publisher=Berman Guedes Stretton|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref>

Chamberlain, Powell and Bon were commissioned to design the Physical Education Centre which was built in 1966. The main characteristic of the building is the roof of the changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid roof light shells and is completely paved in quarry tiles. The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2<U+00BD>-inch think sprayed concrete shells springing from {{convert|80|ft|m|sing=on}} long pre-stressed valley beams. On the south elevation, the roof is supported on raking pre-cast columns and reversed shells form a [[cantilever]]ed canopy.
[[File:Muirheadtower.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Muirhead Tower, originally constructed in 1969, showing the fascia and extensive refurbishment finished in 2009]]

Also completed in 1966 was the Mining and Minerals Engineering and Physical Metallurgy Departments, which was designed by [[Philip Dowson]] of [[Arup|Arup Associates]]. This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. The frame is of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than ten feet away. The building received the 1966 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] Architecture Award for the West Midlands.<ref name=hickman /> It was [[listed building|statutorily listed]] in 1993.<ref name=STS>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/ELibrary?E_LIBRARY_ID=64&a=1141397636571 |title=Signalling the Sixties: 1960s Architecture in Birmingham |location=West Midlands |publisher=Birmingham.gov.uk |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> Taking the full five years from 1962 to 1967, Birmingham erected twelve buildings which each cost in excess of a quarter of a million pounds.<ref>Ives, 2000, p.336</ref>

In 1967 Lucas House, a new hall of residence designed by [[John Madin|The John Madin Design Group]], was completed, providing 150 study bedrooms. It was constructed in the garden of a large house. The Medical School was extended in 1967 to a design by Leonard J. Multon and Partners. The two-storey building was part of a complex which covers the southside of [[Metchley Fort]], a Roman fort. In 1968, the Institute for Education in the Department for Education was opened. This was another Casson, Conder and Partners-designed building. The complex consisted of a group of buildings centred around an eight-storey block, containing study offices, laboratories and teaching rooms. The building has a reinforced concrete frame which is exposed internally and the external walls are of silver-grey rustic bricks. The roofs of the lecture halls, penthouse and Child Study wing are covered in copper.<ref name=hickman />

Arup Associates returned in the 1960s to design the Arts and Commerce Building, better known as Muirhead Tower and houses the Institute of Local Government Studies. This was completed in 1969.<ref name=hickman /> A <U+00A3>42&nbsp;million refurbishment of the 16-storey tower was completed in 2009 and it now houses the Colleges of Social Sciences and the [http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/] Cadbury Research Library, the new home for the University's Special Collections.

Recently completed is a 450-seat concert hall, called the Bramall Music Building, which completes the redbrick semicircle of the Aston Webb building designed by [[Glenn Howells Architects]] with venue design by [[Acoustic Dimensions]]. This auditorium, with its associated research, teaching and rehearsal facilities, houses the Department of Music. The 450-seat auditorium is the most flexible performance space at a UK university - suitable for performances from solo voice, early music, to a full symphony orchestra. When not used for music, it is a high profile location for drama and dance performance and for prestigious lectures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2009/08/12Aug09Auditorium.shtml|title=New Concert Hall for Birmingham to Open in 2012 on University Campus|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> In August 2011 the University announced that architects [[Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands]] and [[S&P]] were appointed to develop a new Indoor Sports Centre as part of a <U+00A3>175 million investment in the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2011/08/09Aug-Estates-Development-FrameworkRelease.aspx |title=University proposes <U+00A3>175m transformation of historic Edgbaston campus |publisher=Birmingham.ac.uk |date=9 August 2011 }}</ref>

====Other features====
[[File:University Station Birmingham DanielXMorris.jpg|thumb|upright|University railway station]]
In 1978, [[University (Birmingham) railway station|University station]], on the [[Cross-City Line]], was opened to serve the university and its hospital. It is the only university campus in mainland Britain with its own railway station.

Located within the Edgbaston site of the university is the [[Winterbourne Botanic Garden]], a 24,000 square metre (258,000 square foot) [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] [[Arts and Crafts]] style garden. There has been much recent development on the western part of the campus. There are new academic buildings, including a learning resource centre and Computer Science department. The massive statue in the foreground was a gift to the University by its sculptor Sir Edward Paolozzi <U+2013> the sculpture is named 'Faraday', and has an excerpt from the poem 'The Dry Salvages' by [[T. S. Eliot]] around its base.

The University of Birmingham operates the [[Lapworth Museum of Geology]] in the Aston Webb Building in [[Edgbaston]]. It is named after [[Charles Lapworth]], a geologist who worked at Mason Science College. Since November 2007, the university has been holding a [[farmers' market]] on the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/event/2008/01/Farmers_Market_23_01_08.shtml |title=University Farmers' Market |publisher=University of Birmingham |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> Birmingham is the first university in the country to have an accredited farmers' market.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2007/10/Farmers_Market_24_10_2007.shtml |title=Walnuts, Wine and Winterbourne Honey at First University Farmers' Market |publisher=University of Birmingham |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

===Selly Oak campus===
The university's [[Selly Oak]] campus is a short distance to the south of the main campus. It was the home of a federation of nine higher education colleges, mainly focused on theology and education, which were integrated into the university for teaching in 1999. Among these was Westhill College (later the University of Birmingham, Westhill), which merged with the University's School of Education in 2001. The Selly Oak campus is now home to the [http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/edacs/departments/drama/index.aspx Department of Drama Theatre Arts] in the newly refurbished Old Library and George Cadbury Hall, 200 seat theatre.The UK [[daytime television]] show ''[[Doctors (soap opera)|Doctors]]'' is filmed on this campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2005/02/17/bbc_birmingham_drama_village_feature.shtml |title=BBC Birmingham Television Drama Village |publisher=BBC Birmingham |accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> The University also has buildings at several other sites in the city.

====University of Birmingham Observatory====
[[File:UoBirmingham Observatory.jpg|thumb|upright|The University of Birmingham Astronomical Observatory]]
In the early 1980s, The University of Birmingham constructed an observatory next to the university playing fields, approximately {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of the Edgbaston campus.  The site was chosen because the night sky was ~100 times darker than the skies above campus.  First light was on 8 December 1982, and the observatory was officially opened by the [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Francis Graham-Smith]], on 13 June 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/archive.php |title=Archive History Section: The History of the University Observatory |publisher=sr.bham.ac.uk |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/history.php |title=Astrophysics & Space Research Group :: The University of Birmingham Observatory :: History |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>

The observatory is used primarily for undergraduate teaching at the University of Birmingham. It has two main instruments, a 16" [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] (working at f/19) and a 14<U+201D> [[Meade Instruments|Meade]] LX200R (working at f/6.35). A third telescope is also present and is used exclusively for visual observations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/ |title=Astrophysics & Space Research Group :: The University of Birmingham Observatory |publisher=sr.bham.ac.uk |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>  Undergraduates of the Physics & Astrophysics programmes use the observatory in their 2nd and 3rd years. In the 2nd year they use this for prime focus imaging (e.g. light curve of an eclipsing binary, orbit of a comet) and in the 3rd year they use it for spectral analysis of celestial bodies (e.g. the wind speed of a P-Cygni star, the distance to a nearby Seyfert galaxy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/year3projects.php |title=Astrophysics & Space Research Group :: The University of Birmingham Observatory :: Year 3 Projects |publisher=sr.bham.ac.uk |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>

As is the case with all of the '[[redbrick]]' civic institutions, the University of Birmingham holds a sizeable student body and teaches a comparatively broader range of courses than smaller institutions. 
<!-- NOT SURE THIS IS NECESSARY
After taking up his post as vice-chancellor in April 2009, [[David Eastwood]] said:

<blockquote>
''When I was appointed, people described this university as a sleeping giant, and there is this feeling that although this is a great university, we could do even better. This is a university which can do yet more and I am here to play my part. That is the challenge, but it's not an easy challenge as we are competing in a global environment. We have some terrific, genuinely global leading research at this university, but we need to build on our research strengths and increase further the quality of our research and the impact of our research. Cancer research is as good here as anywhere, we have one of the best three psychology courses in the country, the best music departments and best sports science degrees in the country, and very good engineering. One of the great attractions of this university is that we have the breadth that other universities dream of, but it's fundamentally about building on our strengths.''<ref name="Giant">{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-education-news/2009/05/12/it-is-time-to-wake-the-sleeping-giant-65233-23596598/|title=It is time to wake the sleeping giant|last=Collins|first=Tony|date=12 May 2009|work=Birmingham Post|accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref>

==Student life==

===Guild of Students===
[[File:BirminghamBUGS.jpg|thumb|Right|[[University of Birmingham Guild of Students]]]]{{Main|University of Birmingham Guild of Students}}
The University of Birmingham Guild of Students is the university's [[students' union|student union]]. Originally the Guild of Undergraduates, the Institution had its first foundations in the [[Mason Science College]] in the centre of Birmingham around 1876. The University of Birmingham itself formally received its Royal Charter in 1900 with the Guild of Students being provided for as a Student Representative Council.<ref>{{harv|Cheesewright|1975|p=35}}</ref> It is not known for certain why the name 'Guild of Students' was chosen as opposed to 'Union of Students', however, the Guild shares its name with [[Liverpool Guild of Students]], another [[Red brick university|'redbrick university']]; both organisations subsequently founded the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. The Union Building, the Guild's bricks and mortar presence, was designed by the architect [[Holland W. Hobbiss]].

The Guild's official purposes are to represent its members and provide a means of socialising, though societies and general amenities. The university provides the Guild with the Union Building effectively rent free as well as a block grant to support student services. The Guild also runs several bars, eateries, social spaces and social events.

The Guild supports a variety of student societies and volunteering projects, roughly around 180 at any one time. The Guild complements these societies and volunteering projects with professional staffed services, including its walk-in Advice and Representation Centre (ARC), Student Development, Job Zone, Student Mentors in halls, and Community Wardens around [[Bournbrook]].<ref>[http://www.guildofstudents.com/DisplayPage.aspx?GroupId=561&id=6371 BUGS: Community Wardens]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> The Guild of Students was where the international volunteering charity [[InterVol]] was conceived and developed as a student-led volunteering project; the group currently sends volunteers to five developing countries each summer.<ref>University of Birmingham Buzz Magazine. Details of InterVol set-up by volunteers including Tamzin Kensett, page 2. Retrieved 29 May 2010. http://www.download.bham.ac.uk/buzz/Buzz_73.pdf</ref> Another two of the Guild's long-standing societies are Student Advice and Nightline (previously Niteline), which both provide peer-to-peer welfare support.  The Guild was one of the first universities in the United Kingdom to publish a campus newspaper, ''[[Redbrick (Newspaper)|Redbrick]]'', supported financially by the Guild of Students and advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bugs.bham.ac.uk/guildofstudents_handbook_web_version.pdf |title=Guild of Students Membership Handbook 2007<U+2013>08 |publisher=University of Birmingham Guild of Students |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

The Guild undertakes its representative function through its officer group, seven of whom are full-time, on sabbatical from their studies, and ten of whom are part-time and hold their positions whilst still studying. Elections are held yearly, conventionally February, for the following academic year. These officers have regular contact with the university's officer-holders and managers. In theory, the Guild's officers are directed and kept to account over their year in office by Guild Council, an 80 seat decision-making body. The Guild also supports the university "student reps" scheme, which aims to provide an effective channel of feedback from students on more of a departmental level.

===Sport===
[[File:Sportsground.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many university athletics fields]]
The university has been consistently ranked in the top four of the [[British Universities & Colleges Sport]] (BUCS) league table.<ref name="busa">[http://www.busa.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000200010003 The BUSA Championship Results 2005/2006], BUSA, 6 July 2006</ref> The university's reputation for sport is a long-standing one; in 1954 it became the first UK university to offer a sports degree, and until 1968 exercise was compulsory for all students.<ref name="Times profile"/> 

In 2004 six graduates and one current student competed in the Athens Olympic games. Four alumni competed at the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, including cyclist [[Paul Manning (cyclist)|Paul Manning]] who won an Olympic Gold. The university hosted the [[Jamaica]]n track and field team prior to the [[2012 London Olympics]]. The team stayed at the University's Conference Park and trained on the University's sports track.<ref name=Jamaica/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2009/08/Bolt_Jamaica_Press_Release_26_08_09.shtml|title=Jamaica Bolts to Birmingham|date=26 August 2009|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>

University of Birmingham Sport (UBS) offers a wide range of competitive and participation sports, which is utilised by the student and local population of Birmingham. Alongside fitness classes such as yoga and aerobics, UBS offers over 40 different sport teams, including [[UBBC|rowing]], [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]] (UBRFC), [[field hockey]], [[ice hockey]] ([[Birmingham Eagles]]), [[American football]] (Birmingham Lions), [[triathlon]] and many more.  The wide selection has ensured the university has  over 2000 students participating in sport.

UBS offers over 40 scholarships and bursaries to national and international students of exceptional athletic ability.

===Housing===
The university provides housing for most first-year students, running a guarantee scheme for all those UK applicants who choose Birmingham as their firm UCAS choice. 90 per cent of university-provided housing is inhabited by first-year students.<ref name=Push>{{cite book|author=Johnny Rich|title=The Push Guide to Which University 2006|year=2005|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=0-7487-9489-1}}</ref>

The university maintained gender-segregated halls until 1999 when Lake and Wyddrington "halls" (treated as two different halls, despite being physically one building) was reborn as Shackleton. University House was decommissioned as accommodation to house the expanding Business School, while Mason Hall has been demolished and rebuilt, opening in 2008. In the summer of 2006, the university sold three of its most distant halls (Hunter Court, the Beeches and Queens Hospital Close) to private operators, while later in the year and during term, the university was forced urgently to decommission both Chamberlain Tower and Manor House over fire safety inspection failures.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The university has rebranded its halls offerings into three villages.

====Vale Village====
The Vale Village includes Chamberlain Hall, Shackleton, Maple Bank, Tennis Court, Elgar Court, Aitken and Chelwood residences. A sixth hall of residence, Mason Hall, re-opened in September 2008 following a complete rebuild. Approximately 1,900 students live in the village.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/|title=Student accommodation: Vale Village|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref>
[[File:Valevillage.jpg|thumb|right|The Vale Village, overlooking Shackleton Hall]]

Shackleton Hall underwent an <U+00A3>11&nbsp;million refurbishment and was re-opened in Autumn 2004. There are 72 flats housing a total of 350 students. The majority of the units consist of six to eight bedrooms, together with a small number of one, two, three or five bedroom studio/apartments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/shackleton.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Shackleton|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> The redevelopment was designed by Birmingham-based architect Patrick Nicholls while employed at Aedas, now a director of Glancy Nicholls Architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glancynicholls.com/ |title=Glancy Nicholls Architects |publisher=Glancy Nicholls Architects |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> 

Maple Bank was refurbished and opened in summer 2005. It consists of 87 five bedroom flats, housing 435 undergraduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/maple.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Maple Bank|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 

The Elgar Court residence consists of 40 six bedroom flats, housing a total of 236 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/elgar.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Elgar Court|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> It is the newest residence to be built, opening in September 2003. 

Tennis Court consists of 138 three, four, five and six bedroom flats and houses 697 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/tennis.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Tennis Court|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> The Aitken wing is a small complex consisting of 23 six and eight bedroom flats. It houses 147 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/aitken.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Aitken|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 

Chelwood is situated at the top of the Vale village overlooking the lake, and comprises 50 en-suite bedrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/chelwood.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Chelwood|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref>

Construction of the new Mason Hall commenced in June 2006 following complete demolition of the original 1960s structures. It was designed by Aedas Architects. The entire project is thought to have cost <U+00A3>36.75&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.estates.bham.ac.uk/projects/Mason%20Hall%20Redev.htm |title=Mason Hall Redevelopment |publisher=The Estates Office (University of Birmingham) |author=Liz Robinson |accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref> It has since been completed, with the first year of students moving in September 2008.

The largest student-run event at the university is also held on the Vale. The [[Vale Festival]] is a large annual music festival, and it has raised over <U+00A3>30,000 a year for charities.

====Pritchatts Park Village====
The Pritchatts Park Village houses over 700 students both undergraduate and postgraduate students.  Halls include 'Ashcroft', 'The Spinney' and 'Oakley Court', as well as 'Pritchatts House' and the 'Pritchatts Road Houses'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/pritchattspark/|title=Student accommodation: Pritchatts Park|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> 

The Spinney is a small complex of six houses and twelve smaller flats, housing 104 students in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/pritchattspark/spinney.shtml|title=Student accommodation: The Spinney|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 
Ashcroft consists of four purpose built blocks of flats and houses 198 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/pritchattspark/ashcroft.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Ashcroft|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 
The four-storey Pritchatts House consists of 24 duplex units and houses 159 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/pritchattspark/pritchattsho.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Pritchatts House|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 
Oakley Court consists of 21 individual purpose-built flats, ranging in size from five to thirteen bedrooms. Also included are 36 duplex units. A total of 213 students are housed in Oakley Court, made up of undergraduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/pritchattspark/oakley.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Oakley Court|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> Oakley Court was completed in 1993 at a cost of <U+00A3>2.9&nbsp;million. It was designed by Birmingham-based [[Associated Architects]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.associated-architects.co.uk/files/oakleycourt.pdf |title=Oakley Court, Pritchatts Road |publisher=Associated Architects |accessdate=2008-05-05 |format=PDF}}</ref> 
Pritchatts Road is a group of four private houses that were converted into student residences. There is a maximum of 16 bedrooms per house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/pritchattspark/pritchattsrd.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Pritchatts Road|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 

====Selly Oak Village====
Selly Oak Village consists of three residences; Jarratt Hall, Douper Hall and Victoria Hall. Jarratt Hall is the only residence in this area owned by the university and students can choose to  rent a room directly from the private companies that own Douper and Victoria Hall. The term <U+2018>Selly Oak Village<U+2019> is rather misleading here, for despite its name the halls themselves are actually located in [[Bournbrook]] rather than in [[Selly Oak]].  The village has 637 bed spaces for students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/sellyoak/|title=Student accommodation: Selly Oak Village|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> 

Douper Hall consists of 28 flats accommodating from two to six persons for 117 undergraduate and postgraduate students.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Jarratt Hall is a large complex designed around a central courtyard and three landscaped areas. It houses a mixture of 587 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/halls/sellyoak.aspx|title=Student accommodation: Jarratt Hall|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref> Jarratt Hall will not accommodate postgraduate students until September 2013 due to refurbishment of kitchens and heating system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Selly Oak Village - University of Birmingham|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/halls/sellyoak.aspx|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref>

====Non-university accommodation====
Until recently, the university had not been served by many private halls; a sole [[Victoria Hall (Student Accommodation)|Victoria Hall]] was built in 1999. However, alongside the former university halls of Hunter Court and the Beeches, a number of other private halls aimed at the University of Birmingham market opened for business in 2007, such as Opal 1 on Bristol Road and IQFive on Bath Row near Five Ways.

Liberty Living now run three halls of residence for Birmingham students, two in Edgbaston and one at QHC near the Fiveways roundabout. All residences retain close ties with the university and contain very few, if any, students from other universities due to its proximity to the Edgbaston campus. 

In addition to this the University has allocation rights to Mansion Brook, a purpose built modern complex offering a variety of studios located in Selly Oak, and Metchley Hall in Harborne.

<!--TRIVIA ==In popular culture==
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[Changing Places]]'' tells the story of exchange of professors between the universities of [[Rummidge]] and Euphoric State, Plotinus, thinly disguised fictional versions of Birmingham and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], which in the book both have replicas of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] on campus.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Showalter  | first = Elaine  | title = Faculty Towers: The Academic Novel and Its Discontents  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 2005  | location = Oxford  | page = 77  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=jnpf3RJXnF8C&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22changing+places%22+novel+pisa  | id =  | isbn =978-0-19-928332-3 }}</ref>

The university campus has been used as a filming location for a number of film and television productions, particularly those of the [[BBC]] which has a presence at the university's [[Selly Oak]] campus, the [[BBC Drama Village]]. Scenes from the [[John Cleese]] film ''[[Clockwise (film)|Clockwise]]'' were filmed at the campus' east entrance, while several episodes of the BBC detective series ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe (BBC TV Series)|Dalziel and Pascoe]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzz.bham.ac.uk/3468Buzz34.pdf|title=Buzz Issue 34 vol.3 November 2003|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> daytime soap ''[[Doctors (soap opera)|Doctors]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzz.bham.ac.uk/3513Buzz35.pdf|title=Buzz Issue 35 vol.3 November 2003 Mid-month edition|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> and [[CBBC]] series ''[[Brum (television)|Brum]]'' have been filmed in and around campus. Interior and exterior scenes for a BBC adaptation of Birmingham alumnus [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[Nice Work]]'' and BBC comedy drama ''[[A Very Peculiar Practice]]'' were also shot in and around the University campus and halls of residence with a number of students appearing as extras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/peculiar.shtml|title=A Very Peculiar Practice|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> A trailer for the BBC's [[Red Nose Day#2007event|Red Nose Day 2007]], featuring [[Lou and Andy]] from ''[[Little Britain]]'', was filmed near the School of Biosciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMFIp1Ao9Y |title=Red Nose Day 2007 Little Britain Advert |publisher=YouTube }}</ref> More recently, an episode of the BBC show ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'' was filmed on campus with interior and exterior shots of the Aston Webb building, in addition to internal shots of the School of Biosciences.

[[Post punk]] band [[Joy Division]] played their final gig at the University High Hall on 2 May 1980 (now known as Chamberlain Hall), 16 days before the suicide of singer/songwriter, [[Ian Curtis]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Paul Morley and Adrian Thrills|title=Don't walk away in silence|work=NME|date=14 June 1980}}</ref> A recording of the performance accompanies the ''[[Still (Joy Division album)|Still]]'' compilation album. It includes one of only two available recordings of the song "[[Ceremony (song)|Ceremony]]" (the other being a demo rehearsal), which later became a single for [[New Order]]. Fairport Convention recorded much of the live album "Farewell, Farewell" at Lake Hall during the May Ball on 11 May 1979, using the Island Records mobile studio. -->

==Branding==
[[File:Old University of Brimingham logo.png|thumb|upright|The University's logo from the 1980s until 2005]]
The original coat of arms was designed in 1900. It features a double headed lion (on the left) and a mermaid holding a mirror and comb (to the right). These symbols owe to the coat of arms of the institution's predecessor, Mason College.

In 2005 the university began rebranding itself. A simplified edition of the shield which had been introduced in the 1980s reverted to a detailed version based on how it appears on the university's original Royal Charter. After a research project into the image of the university, it was decided that a separate logo was required to redefine the institution as modern and contemporary. A new 'word marque', using the "U and B" letters and the [[Baskerville]] font (in honour of the Birmingham printer [[John Baskerville]]) is used as the primary logo when trying to attract both prospective investors and students. It is also found on campus vehicles. The traditional coat of arms, by contrast, appears on degree certificates and academic documents. The introduction of new signage throughout the campus, featuring the shield rather than the "U and B" logo, was completed at the end of 2006.
