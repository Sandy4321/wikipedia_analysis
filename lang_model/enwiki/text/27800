The '''Scottish Aeroplane Avis''' was a [[Tractor configuration|tractor]] [[monoplane]] built by [[Howard T Wright]] in 1909. At that time Wright was one of England's foremost aircraft engineers, and had several monoplane aircraft under development. The Avis  was shown at the 1910 Aero Exhibition in London and  several examples were successfully flown during 1910.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Design and Development==
The Avis was designed by Wright and [[William Oke Manning]] for Alan Boyle's newly formed [[Scottish Aeroplane Syndicate]] and was constructed at Wright's Battersea works during 1909. It was a single-seat tractor monoplane with an uncovered wire-braced wooden [[fuselage]] using [[wing-warping]] for lateral control, resembling the aircraft that [[Louis Bleriot]] had used to make the first flight across the English Channel. The wings were braced by wires attached to two pairs of [[cabane struts]], which extended down and outwards to form two A-frames carrying a pair of skids to each of which a pair of wheels was attached using [[bungee cord|shock cords]]. It had an all-moving [[cruciform tail]], built as a single assembly articulated on a [[universal joint]]. A small sprung tailwheel was fitted.<ref>Ransom 1987 p92</ref> At that time there was no standardised system for control layout and the Avis used foot pedals for lateral control, and  a stick with a wheel at the top to control rudder and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]].<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200185.html The Avis monoplane][[Flight magazine]], 3 March 1910</ref>
  
The prototype, known as the ''Golden Plover'' fitted with a 30&nbsp;hp (22&nbsp;kW) [[Anzani]] engine and a Chauviere [[aluminium]] propeller. It was finished in December 1909, but trials at Brooklands were unsatisfactory and the engine was replaced by a {{convert|35|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Anzani driving a wooden propeller manufactured by Wright. The prototype was first successfully flown by Boyle in March 1910. It was sold to Mr Maconie, who used it at Brooklands in August 1910.<ref>Ransom 1987, p.90</ref>

==Operational history==
A second aircraft, now called the '''Avis''' and sometimes called the '''Avis II''' because it was the second built, powered by a {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[J.A.P.]] was exhibited by the Scottist Aeronautical Syndicate at Olympia in Jan 1910.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200185.html The Avis Monoplane], [[Flight magazine]], 3 March 1910</ref> This aircraft was bought by R.F. Wickham, who flew it at Brooklands, extensively damaging it after a forced landing caused by engine failure.<ref name="Ransom90">Ransom 1987 p. 90</ref>

The third built, which was powered by {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[E.N.V.]]  engine was officially named the '''Avis I''' and was used as a personal machine by Boyle, who confusingly gave it his personal number "3", which was painted on the tail. He  gained his Aero Club certificate (number 13) in it on 14 July, but wrecked the aircraft at the Bournmouth Air display later that month.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200891.html From the British Flying Grounds], [[Flight Magazine]], 29 October 1910</ref>

An example referred to as '''Avis III''' was bought by the racing driver [[J. H. Spottiswode]], who later sold it to a photographer called Campbell Gray.<ref name="Ransom90"/>

Another, '''Avis IV''', was used by Boyle to replace the aircraft wrecked at Bournemouth, but when the Scottish Aeronautical Syndicate was dissolved at the end of the year this was sold at auction at Brooklands, going for <U+00A3>50 to Eustace Gray, the Brooklands press steward.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%201058.html Brooklands Airodrome], [[Flight magazine]], 24 December 1910</ref>
