The '''Church of St Morwenna and St John the Baptist, Morwenstow''' is in the parish of [[Morwenstow]], north [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom ({{gbmapping|SS205153}}).  The church is dedicated to [[Morwenna]], a local saint, and to [[John the Baptist]].  It is a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref name=images/>  It is an active [[Anglican]] [[parish church]] in the [[diocese of Truro]], the archdeaconry of Bodmin and the deanery of Stratton.  Its [[benefice]] is combined with that of St James, Kilkhampton.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/diocesesparishes/infosheets/parish_results.html?parishid=C14717 |title= Information Sheet |accessdate=2008-08-13 |publisher= [[Church of England]] }}</ref>

From 1835 to 1874 the vicar of the parish was [[Robert Stephen Hawker|Rev. R. S. Hawker]], [[poet]] and [[antiquary]]<ref name=images>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=64904 |title=Images of England: Church of St Morwenna and St John the Baptist, Morwenstow   |accessdate=2008-01-16 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref> who is credited with creating the modern form of the [[harvest festival]] church service.  It stands in a remote position near cliffs on the west coast of Cornwall.  Amongst the tombs and gravestones in the church yard is the preserved [[figurehead]] from a ship which was wrecked nearby.<ref name=frith>{{citation  | last =Sackett | first =Eliza (ed.) | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =British Churches |edition= | publisher =Bounty Books | date =2006 | location =London | pages =8 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-7537-1442-6 }}</ref>  



==History==

Although the earliest fabric in the present church is [[Norman architecture|Norman]], it is believed that an earlier [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] church stood on the site.  At some time before 1291 the [[advowson]] was granted to St John's Hospital at Bridgewater by the [[Bishop of Exeter]]. In a document dated 1296, the church was referred to as an "old and well-known structure".<ref name=calling>{{citation  |url=http://www.cornwall-calling.co.uk/churches/morwenstow-church.htm |title=Morwenstow Church, Cornwall |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=Cornwall Calling }}</ref>  Additions to the church were made in the 13th, 15th and 16th centuries.  The church was restored in the 1850s under the direction of Rev. Hawker when the [[box pew]]s were removed and the wooden [[Roof shingle|shingles]] on the roof were replaced.  A further restoration took place in the 1870s, probably by [[James Piers St Aubyn|J.P. St Aubyn]].  A vestry was added in 1887 and there were further restorations in 1904 and 1908.  The colouring of the chancel roof was restored in 1934.<ref name=images/>

==Structure==

The church is built in stone with 19th century slate roofs.  Most of the stone is [[rubble]] but some dressed stone is present.  The arcades dating from the 12th and 13th centuries are made from local dunstone, the 15th century arcade is constructed from [[polyphant]], and the 16th century piers and arches are in [[granite]].  The plan of the church consists of a west tower, a nave and chancel, five-bay north and south arcades, a south porch and a northeast vestry.  The tower has three stages. It is built in rubble with granite for the long and short [[quoin]]s, the string course, [[battlement|embattled]] [[parapet]], and the tall corner [[pinnacle]]s with [[crocket]]ted [[finial]]s.  The doorway to the porch consists of the outer order of a Norman doorway which has been moved from elsewhere.  It includes zigzag carving and flowers carved in heavy [[relief]].  The doorway to the church itself consists of the inner two orders of the Norman doorway with zigzag carving on both orders.  On the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] are carved birds and pine cones.  Internally the westerly three bays of the north arcade are Norman and include zigzag carving and a carved ram's head.  The two easterly arcades are Transitional.  The south arcade is mainly [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] in style.<ref name=images/>

==Fittings and furniture==

The pew ends are carved with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[tracery]] above [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] [[arabesque]]s.   One pew end is inscribed with "T.K.", for Rev. Thomas Kempthorne, who was vicar from 1539 to 1594; another has the date of 1575.<ref name=images/>  The Norman [[baptismal font|font]] is roughly shaped with ropework decoration beneath a plain bowl.<ref name=frith/>  The [[pulpit]] dates from the 20th century and incorporates some earlier woodwork as blind tracery.  The chancel screen which was initially constructed by Rev. Hawker was removed after his death and then replaced in 1908.  It is made from fragments of 16th and 17th carving.  In the chancel is a large [[reredos]] dated 1908 which was designed by E. H. Sedding and carved by the Pinwill sisters of [[Plymouth]]. It contains a [[cartoon]] by [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] and three engravings by John Baptist-Jackson.  In the south wall of the chancel is a [[piscina]] and on the north wall is a fragment of a mural painting dating from the late 15th or early 16th century.<ref name=images/>  The painting  depicts a female holding a scroll in her left hand with her right arm raised in blessing over a kneeling monk.  It is thought to represent St Morwenna.<ref name=calling/>  In the church are a number of tomb chests and memorials.  One of the memorials is a large slate plate in the floor beside the pulpit to the memory of Hawker's first wife, Charlotte, who died in 1863.  At the west end of the church is a 17th century communion table.  In the south aisle is the Hawker memorial window by [[Lavers, Barraud and Westlake|Lavers and Westlake]] which was erected in 1904.  It depicts Hawker and his dog, the church and various other features associated with Hawker.<ref name=images/>  

===Organ===

The organ was built by [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd]] of London in 1892 and rebuilt by Geo. Osmond of Taunton in 1969.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N12217 |title= Morwenstow St. John the Baptist |accessdate=2008-08-13 |publisher= [[British Institute of Organ Studies]] }}</ref>  

===Bells===

The [[ring of bells|ring]] is of six bells.  Four of these were cast by [[Rudhall of Gloucester|Abel Rudhall]] in 1753, the other two being by Mears & Stainbank of the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] dated 1902.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Morwenstow&Submit=++Go++&DoveID=MORWENSTOW |title= Morwenstow S John Bapt |accessdate=2008-08-13 |publisher= [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]] }}</ref>

Hawker to commemorate the death of his first wife, Charlotte.  Her initials C. E. H. are carved on the shaft.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=64913 |title=Images of England: Cross |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  Elsewhere in the churchyard is a carved and painted wooden [[figurehead]] depicting the figure of Caledonia holding a drawn sword and shield.  It is the figurehead of ''[[The Caledonia (brig)|The Caledonia]]'', a Scottish [[brig]] which was shipwrecked off Morwenstow in 1843 and is erected to the memory of its captain and crew who are buried nearby.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=64912 |title=Images of England: Ship's figurehead |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  At the entry to the churchyard are an adjoining [[stile]], a [[lychgate]] and a former [[Morgue|mortuary]].  The stile dates from the 19th century. It is constructed in freestone ashlar and slate and was probably designed by Rev. Hawker.  The lychgate, which is wooden with a slate roof, was built in 1641 and extensively repaired in 1738.  The former mortuary, which is now used as a store, is a stone building which was used for laying out the corpses of drowned sailors.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=64914|title=Images of England: Stile, lychgate and former mortuary |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  In a corner of the vicarage garden about 125 metres from the church is the [[holy well]] of St. John over which is a medieval well house. This is a rectangular stone building with a timber door and a steeply gabled stone roof with a flat ridge.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=64917 |title=Images of England: Holy well of St John |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.holywells.com/html/holy_well_details_28.html |title=St John's Well |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=Holy Wells in Tarka Country }}</ref>  Further from the church, to its west, and 14 metres down the cliff face is the holy well of St Morwenna.  Its well house also originates from the medieval period and it consists of a dressed stone gabled structure built into the side of the cliff.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=64918 |title=Images of England: Holy well of St Morwenna |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref><ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.holywells.com/html/holy_well_details_27.html |title=St Morwenna's Well |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=Holy Wells in Tarka Country }}</ref>  Nearby on the coast path is [[Hawker's Hut]], constructed by Rev. Hawker from [[driftwood]].  It is owned and managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.cornwall-calling.co.uk/famous-cornish-people/hawker.htm |title= Reverend Hawker, of Morwenstow Church |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=Cornwall Calling }}</ref>
