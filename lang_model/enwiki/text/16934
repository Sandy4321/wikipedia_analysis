''''' The Old Corral ''''' is a 1936 American [[Western (genre)|Western]] film directed by [[Joseph Kane]] and starring [[Gene Autry]], [[Smiley Burnette]], and [[Irene Manning]]. Based on a story by [[Bernard McConville]], the film is about a sheriff of a small western town who sings his way into a relationship with a singer from a Chicago nightclub who earlier witnessed a murder.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|title=The Old Corral |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028054/ |accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref> 

The film features an uncredited and unshaven [[Roy Rogers]] as the leader of the O'Keefe Brothers, played by the singing [[Sons of the Pioneers]], a troupe of western singers trying to break into radio. Rogers' first appearance, in which he and his group rob a busload of people to garner publicity, ends with Autry threatening to arrest Rogers as soon as he's back on a horse. Sixteen months after ''The Old Corral'' was released, Roy Rogers starred in his first feature film, ''[[Under Western Stars]]''. 

==Plot==
After witnessing nightclub owner Tony Pearl murdered by gangster Mike Scarlotti (John Bradford), blues singer Eleanor Spenser ([[Irene Manning]]) flees Chicago and heads West on a bus. Soon her picture appears in newspapers across the country. The bus makes a stop in Turquoise City, New Mexico, where Martin Simms (Cornelius Keefe), the crooked owner of the Blue Moon saloon, befriends Eleanor. After seeing her picture in the newspapers, Simms, who is hoping to collect a reward from Scarlotti, sends the gangster a telegram revealing Eleanor's whereabouts.

The bus is held up by the O'Keefe Brothers ([[Sons of the Pioneers]]), a local aspiring singing troupe seeking publicity. Sheriff Gene Autry ([[Gene Autry]]) arrests all of the O'Keefe Brothers, except Buck and Tom who escape. Meanwhile Simms sees Eleanor preparing to leave town and is able to convince her to stay. Gene arrives on the scene and recognizes Eleanor from the bus. She introduces herself as Jane Edwards, the new entertainer at his Blue Moon saloon. Sometime later Gene sees Eleanor's picture in a newspaper and goes to the Blue Moon saloon to protect her against Simms. Gene and Eleanor end up singing a song together.

Gene discovers Buck and Tom in their hideout at the old corral and hires the O'Keefes to perform at the town plaza for Turquoise City's celebration of its new dam. During the concert, Scarlotti arrives and threatens Simms, trying to force him to reveal Eleanor's whereabouts. Deputy Frog ([[Smiley Burnette]]) is able to warn Eleanor about Scarlotti's arrival and takes her to the old corral to hide. Scarlotti follows them to the old corral. Gene recruits the O'Keefe Brothers as his posse, who stampede cattle, forcing Scarlotti's men to scatter. Gene arrests Scarlotti, and Eleanor names him as the murderer of Tony Pearl. Gene also arrests Simms for intimidating a witness. Gene then releases the O'Keefe Brothers, sings another song, and kisses Eleanor.
