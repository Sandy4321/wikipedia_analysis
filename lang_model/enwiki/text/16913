'''Weymouth''' ({{PronEng|<U+02C8>we<U+026A>m<U+0259><U+03B8>}}) is a large town in [[Dorset]], England, situated on a sheltered bay at the mouth of the [[River Wey, Dorset|River Wey]] on the [[English Channel]] coast. The town is {{Convert|8|mi|km|0}} south of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and {{Convert|5|mi|km|0}} north of the [[Isle of Portland]]. The town's population is 52,950 (2006) with a catchment population of 71,700 (2001). 

The [[A354 road]] bridge connects Weymouth to Portland, which together form the borough of [[Weymouth and Portland]]. The history of the borough stretches back to the 12th century; including involvement in the spread of the [[Black Death]], the [[British colonization of the Americas|settlement of the Americas]], the development of [[Georgian architecture]], and preparations for [[World War II]].

Fishing and trading employ fewer people in the area since their peak in earlier centuries, but tourism has continuously increased its presence in the town since the 18th century and is now the primary industry. Weymouth is a tourist [[seaside resort|resort]], and its economy depends on its harbour and visitor attractions; the town is a gateway situated half-way along the [[Jurassic Coast]], a [[World Heritage Site]] on the Dorset and east [[Devon]] coast, important for its geology and landforms. Weymouth Harbour is home to cross-channel ferries, pleasure boats and private yachts, and nearby [[Portland Harbour]] is home to the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]], where the [[Sailing at the Summer Olympics|sailing events]] of the [[2012 Olympic Games]] will be held.

== History ==
Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of [[Wyke Regis]]. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and become a chartered [[borough]].<ref name="dorsetpage">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://www.thedorsetpage.com/locations/place/W200.htm | title = Weymouth, Dorset, England | publisher = The Dorset Page | accessdate = 2006-11-26}}</ref> [[Melcombe Regis]] developed separately on the [[peninsula]] to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310.<ref name="dorsetpage" />

Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the [[Black Death]] came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship.<ref name="dorsetpage" /> In their early history [[Municipal Borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis|Weymouth and Melcombe Regis]] were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1571 to form a double borough.<ref name="dorsetpage" /> Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main town centre. The villages of [[Upwey, Dorset|Upwey]], [[Broadwey]], [[Preston, Dorset|Preston]], [[Wyke Regis]], [[Chickerell]], [[Southill, Weymouth|Southill]], [[Radipole]] and [[Littlemoor]] have become part of the built-up area.

In the centre of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; although it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of [[Melcombe Regis]] (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century this has been overcome with successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting [[bascule bridge]] to let boats access the [[Weymouth Marina|inner harbour]], one of ten in the United Kingdom.<ref name="townbridge">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=486 | title = Melcombe Regis historic buildings | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-03|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006141030/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp%3Fsvid%3D486 |archivedate = October 06, 2007|deadurl=yes}} </ref>

Weymouth is the largest town in the area, larger than the county town of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], which lies just to the north, and hence is a centre of activity for the nearby population. A steep ridge of [[chalk]] called the [[South Dorset Downs]] separates Dorchester and Weymouth; they are less agricultural than the valleys in the centre and north of [[Dorset]], but have [[dairy agriculture|dairy]] and [[arable land|arable]] farms. The nearest villages to Weymouth are part of the built-up area, including Wyke Regis, [[Chickerell]] and Preston.

=== Climate ===
Due to its location on the south-west coast of England, Weymouth has a [[temperate]] climate ([[Koppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures.

Weymouth Harbour is long and narrow, and formed the [[estuary]] of the [[River Wey, Dorset|River Wey]] until the building of a bridge to Westham, which separated the harbour's [[Weymouth Marina|backwaters]] from [[Radipole Lake]].

There used to be a large station to handle heavy summer tourist traffic, but this traffic declined and the station was demolished in 1986.

[[Image:Dorset transport.png|thumb|right|400px|The A354 and A353 roads, Condor Ferries, and the South Western and Heart of Wessex lines link to Weymouth.]]
The [[A354 road]] connects the town to the [[A35 road|A35]] [[trunk road]] in Dorchester, and terminates at [[Easton, Dorset|Easton]] on the Isle of Portland. The A353 road runs east from Weymouth to the south of [[Warmwell]], where it connects with the [[A352 road|A352]] to the [[Isle of Purbeck]] and Wareham. In the 1980s the town centre was bypassed by the A354 to Portland, but the government's road building policy changed before a proposed relief road could be completed. The A354 follows its original route through Upwey and Broadwey, where traffic problems are common at peak tourist times, particularly on event days such as the carnival.<ref name="reliefroad">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=3463 | title = Weymouth Relief Road | publisher = Dorset County Council | accessdate = 2006-06-22}}</ref>

The relief road's construction was delayed by opposition from residents and [[environmentalism|environmental]] groups, including [[Transport 2000]] and the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]], who object to the route's partial destruction of a nature reserve, which is an [[AONB]] and [[SSSI]].<ref name="roadprotest">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/display.var.1531988.0.relief_road_protest_lodged.php | title = Relief Road Protest Lodged | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 2007-07-10}}</ref> With Weymouth and Portland scheduled to host 2012 Olympic sailing events the project reopened; the local authorities favouring a more environmentally friendly proposal than in the 1990s.<ref name="reliefroad" /> On 5 April 2007, [[Dorset]] County Council granted planning permission for a modified proposal including a single carriageway running {{Convert|7|km|mi|0}} north, and a 1000-space park-and-ride scheme, costing [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]84.5 million.<ref name="reliefroadaccepted">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/haveyoursay/makingtheheadlines/display.var.1311799.0.0.php?act=complaint&cid=178246 | title = Green Light for Relief Road | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref> Work commenced in 2008; it has been agreed that the work be completed in three years, in time for the 2012 Olympic sailing events.<ref name="reliefroadaccepted" /> During archaeological excavations carried out in advance of the relief road construction, a burial pit containing [[Ridgeway Hill massacre|51 dismembered skeletons of Viking men]] was discovered on Ridgeway Hill.<ref name="BBC 2009-07-10">{{cite news|title=Dismembered skeletons' Saxon link|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8145252.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-07-10|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref>
