''' Johan Birger Essen Dahlerus''' ([[February 6]] [[1891]] - [[March 8]] [[1957]]),  was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] businessman, amateur [[diplomat]] and friend of [[Hermann Goering]], who tried through diplomatic channels to prevent the [[Second World War]].

==Biography ==
Birger Dahlreus was born in Stockholm in 1891. 

It had been known to the senior military personnel of the [[Third Reich]], at least since the Military Conference of [[August 6]] [[1939]] at [[Obersalzberg]], that aggressive war between [[Greater Germany]] and the Western powers was imminent.<ref>Unpublished diaries, General Franz Halder, Chief of Staff</ref>. Early in July 1939 Dahlerus arranged a meeting, at his own house near the Danish border in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], between Goering and seven British businessmen, whose names are lost to history. The businessmen attempted to persuade Goering that the British Government would stand by its treaty obligations to Poland, which obliged it to support the Polish Government in any coflict in which it became embroiled. Dahlerus believed that they had succeeded.<ref> Nuremburg Trial testimony.</ref> At the Nuremburg trials the British prosecuter,  Sir [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]], was able to persuade the Swede that he had been badly misled by the German leaders. Clearly, the discussion had no effect on the policy and actions of the Third Reich.

On [[August 25]] [[1939]] The British and Polish Governments converted the unilateral declaration of support offered by the British Government into a mutual assistance pact. On the same day [[Benito Mussolini]] wrote to Hitler to indicate that he would not be able at this time to declare war on the Western Powers <ref>Ciano Diaries</ref> Dahlerus, at this time, was acting as an intermediary between Goering and the British Foreign Secretary, [[Lord Halifax]].<ref> Goering interrogation, Nuremburg Trials 29.8.45</ref> Goering had summoned Dahlerus from Stockholm on the previous day, put him on an aircraft, and dispatched him to inform the British Government that Germany wanted an understanding with Great Britain. Halifax informed him that diplomatic channels were open, and his input was unnecessary.

Following a telephone conversation between himself and Goering, Dahlerus had a further conversation with Halifax on August 26th. He persuaded the British Foreign Secretary to write a letter, couched in non-specific terms, indicating the desire of the British Government for peace and requesting a few days leeway in which to achieve it.<ref>Documents on British foreign Policy, Third series, Volume VII, p 283.</ref> 

On August 27th Dahlerus flew to London, and met [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[Lord Halifax]], [[Sir Horace Wilson]] and [[Sir Alexander Cadogan]]. He presented an offer, which included a proposal that Britain would agree to Germany taking [[Danzig]] and the [[Polish corridor]]. It was felt that this was an unacceptable proposal, and that the Poles would fight rather than agree to it. It was agreed that Dahlerus would return to [[Berlin]] and report back with Hitler's reply.<ref>Documents on British Foreign Policy, Third series, Volume VII, p 287</ref> Dahlerus had become so significant, according to his own testimony, that he felt able to advise the British Government that they should keep [[Neville Henderson|Ambassador Neville Henderson]] in London until the next day so that he could better react to Hitler's response.

On August 29th, at a meeting with the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], Neville Henderson had been presented with a document containing sixteen points which Germany demanded that Poland agree to. Henderson says <ref>Failure of a Mission, Neville Henderson</ref> that they were spoken too fast for him to understand, and that he was denied a written copy. On the following day, Dahlerus was given a copy of the sixteen points by Goering, and took them to Henderson. Henderson in turn dispatched him to [[Lipski]], the Polish ambassador, who had never heard of Dahlerus. As one of the sixteen points was that a Polish negotiator with full plenipotentiary powers should appear in Berlin  before September 1st, the Polish Government deemed the proposals unreasonable.

On August 31st Lipski was received by Ribbentrop. On being asked if he had come as a fully empowered delegate, and on stating that he had not, he was dismissed.<ref>Lipski's final report, Polish White Book</ref> An intercepted copy of the telegram to Lipski, defining his powers, was given by Goering to Dahlerus to take to Henderson.

Dahlerus' final diplomatic effort before the onset of war occurred on the afternoon of the last day of peace. He proposed that Goering should again meet with Henderson, which he did at 5 pm. Sir [[George Forbes]], the counsellor at the embassy, was also present. His statement, presented at Nuremberg, describes the atmosphere as negative, and suggests Goering's confidence in the ability of Germany to crush Poland quickly.<ref>Dahlerus testimony, Nuremberg trials, TMWC IX, pp470-471</ref>

The Third Reich commenced land operations against Poland on [[September 1]] [[1939]] at 04.45. At 08.00 Dahlerus met Goering, who informed him that the Poles had attacked Germany (sic) at [[Dirschau]]. Dahlerus, in his Nuremburg testimony, says that "I informed somebody that according to the information I had received the Poles had attacked, and they naturally wondered what was happening to me when I gave that information". Dahlerus also stated that "the Poles are sabotaging everything" and that he had "evidence they never meant to attempt to negotiate".<ref>DBrFP, VII, pp 474-5</ref>

Dahlerus telephoned London again at 12.30, and this time was put through to [[Sir Alexander Cadogan|Cadogan]]. Cadogan, while being a committed [[appeasement|anti-appeaser]], was only the Under-Secretary of State, and Dahlerus insisted that his comments be submitted to the [[Cabinet]]. They duly were, and the answer given to the Swede was that negotiation was only possible on the basis of the immediate withdrawal of German forces from Polish territory.

The British and the French Governments issued ultimata to the German Government on [[September 3]] [[1939]]. Dahlerus telephoned the British foreign Office ten minutes before the British ultimatum expired, with a proposal that Goering should fly immediately to London for negotiations.<ref>DBrFP, VII, no 762, p537</ref> Perhaps not surprisingly, the approach was rejected, and Dahlerus disappeared from the World stage until the Nuremberg trials, apart from a brief and ineffective liaison between Hitler and Forbes on [[September 26]] [[1939]], which achieved nothing.

Birger Dahlreus died in Stockholm in 1957.
