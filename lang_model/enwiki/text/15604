'''Artur Axmann''' (18 February 1913 <U+2013> 24 October 1996) was the German [[Nazism|Nazi]] leader of the Hitler Youth (''[[Reichsjugendf<U+00FC>hrer]]'') from 1940 to the war's end in 1945. He was the last living Nazi with a rank equivalent to [[Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer]].

== Early life ==
Axmann was born in [[Hagen]] on 18 February 1913. In 1928, he founded the first Hitler Youth group in [[Westphalia]]. He became very active in the local [[Nazi Party]]. Thereafter, he studied law at school.

== Nazi career ==
In 1932, he was called to be a Reich Leader (''[[Reichsleiter]]'') of the Nazi Party (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or NSDAP) to carry out a reorganisation of Nazi youth cells. In 1933, Axmann became Chief of the Social Office of the Reich Youth Leadership. He directed the Hitler Youth in state vocational training and succeeded in raising the status of Hitler Youth agricultural work.

=== War service ===
He was on active service on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] until May 1940. In August of the same year Axmann succeeded [[Baldur von Schirach]] as Reich Youth Leader (''[[Reichsjugendf<U+00FC>hrer]]'') of the Nazi Party. In 1941, he was severely wounded on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], losing an arm.

During the last weeks of the war, Axmann commanded units of the [[Hitler Youth]] (''Hitlerjugend''), which had been incorporated into the Home Guard (''[[Volkssturm]]''). His units consisted mostly of children and adolescents. They primarily fought in the [[Battle of Seelow Heights]] (''Seelower H<U+00F6>hen''), which was a part of the larger [[Battle of Berlin]] (''Endkampf um Berlin'').

On 4 January 1944, Axmann was awarded the [[German Order (decoration)|German Order]], the highest decoration that the Nazi Party could bestow on an individual, for his services to the Reich. He and one other recipient, [[Konstantin Hierl|K. Hierl]], were the only holders of the award to survive the war and its consequences. All other recipients were either awarded it posthumously, or were killed during the war or its aftermath.

During 1945, Axmann was pressured to let young women be conscripted into combat roles for the last defence of Germany. Although Axmann had permitted young boys to fight in the final days, he refused to allow girls to fight. He stated, "Women bring life into the world, they do not take it."{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Breakout ===
During [[Hitler]]'s last days, Axmann was among those present in the [[F<U+00FC>hrerbunker]]. On 30 April 1945, just a few hours before [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committing suicide]], Hitler signed the order to allow a breakout. On 1 May, Axmann left the F<U+00FC>hrerbunker with SS doctor [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] and [[Martin Bormann]] as part of a group attempting to break out of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] encirclement. Their group managed to cross the [[River Spree]] at the [[Weidendammer Bridge]].<ref>Beevor, Antony. ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', Viking-Penguin Books, 2002, p. 382.</ref>

Leaving the rest of their group, Bormann, Stumpfegger and Axmann walked along railway tracks to [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof|Lehrter railway station]]. Bormann and Stumpfegger followed the railway tracks towards [[Stettiner station]]. Axmann decided to go in the opposite direction of his two companions.{{sfn|Le Tissier|2010|p=188}} When he encountered a [[Red Army]] patrol, Axmann doubled back and later insisted he had seen the bodies of Bormann and Stumpfegger near the railway switching yard (Stettiner Bahnhof) with moonlight clearly illuminating their faces.{{sfn|Le Tissier|2010|p=188}}<ref>Trevor-Roper, H. ''Last Days of Hitler'', Pan Books, 1962, p. 245.</ref> He did not have time to check the bodies, so he did not know how they died.<ref>Beevor, Antony. ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', Viking-Penguin Books, 2002, p. 383.</ref>

He avoided capture by Soviet troops and disappeared. Axmann, presumed dead, lived under the alias of "Erich Siewert" for several months. Axmann was arrested in December 1945 when a Nazi underground movement which he had been organising was uncovered by a [[U.S. Army]] counterintelligence operation.

=== Trials ===
In May 1949, a [[Nuremberg]] [[de-Nazification]] court sentenced Axmann to a prison sentence of three years and three months as a 'major offender'.

On 19 August 1958, a [[West Berlin]] de-Nazification court fined the former Hitler Youth leader 35,000 [[Deutsche Mark|mark]]s (approximately [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]3,000, or $8,300 USD), about half the value of his property in Berlin. The court found him guilty of indoctrinating German youth with National Socialism until the end of the [[Third Reich]], but concluded he had been a Nazi from inner conviction rather than base motives. During his trial, Axmann told the court he heard the shot by which Hitler committed suicide. He also stated he had attempted to escape from central Berlin along with [[Martin Bormann]], who he said had died during the attempt.

== Death ==
Axmann died in Berlin on 24 October 1996, aged 83. His cause of death and details of his surviving family members were not disclosed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/world/artur-axmann-83-a-top-nazi-who-headed-the-hitler-youth.html | title = Artur Axmann, 83, a Top Nazi Who Headed the Hitler Youth | accessdate = 2 February 2014 | author = Alan Cowell | date = 7 November 1996 | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' }}</ref>
