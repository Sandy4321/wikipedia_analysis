'''Brian David Scalabrine''' (born March 18, 1978) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player who last played with the [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Raised in [[Enumclaw, Washington]], Scalabrine attended the [[University of Southern California]] after transferring from [[Highline Community College]]. As a member of the [[USC Trojans men's basketball]] team, Scalabrine was the top average scorer and a leader in field goals and rebounds. He also played at the [[Center (basketball)|center]] position in college.

The [[New Jersey Nets]] selected him in the second round of the [[2001 NBA Draft]]. The Nets made the [[2002 NBA Finals]] during his rookie season, and Scalabrine played four seasons with the team. In 2005, he signed with the [[Boston Celtics]] and won a championship with the team in 2008. The Celtics also appeared in the [[2010 NBA Finals]]. Scalabrine signed with the [[Chicago Bulls]] the following season, and played with them until 2012. Throughout his NBA career, Scalabrine served as a backup [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. Although he never averaged more than 6.3 points per game, Scalabrine became a fan favorite across the league.

In 2012, Scalabrine turned down a chance to become an assistant coach with the Bulls to pursue opportunities in broadcasting.

He led the Trojans in scoring (14.6 points), rebounding (6.4), and field goals (53.1%). In scoring, blocked shots, and field goals, he was also the only [[Pac-10]] conference player among the top 10 players in those areas. His best game performance was against [[American Eagles|American University]] on December 21, 1998: 26 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=1998-99 Southern California Trojans Schedule and Results|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/USC/1999-schedule.html|publisher=sports-reference.com|accessdate=July 31, 2011}}</ref> On February 13, 1999, he scored 22 points including an important three-pointer in overtime; the unranked USC won an upset victory over number-six [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]] 86-82 in overtime.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stanford and U.C.L.A.
