{{TroopengagementsoftheAmericanCivilWarTOC}}
This is a list of battles and skirmishes of the [[American Civil War]] during the year [[1865]], the final year of the war. During the year, Union forces were able to capture the last major Confederate ports still open to shipping, along with the Confederate capital, and forced the surrender of the four major Confederate commands.

In the Eastern Theater, a combined Union army and naval force captured [[Fort Fisher]] at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in January, closing the port of [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] to Confederate shipping (the city itself would be captured the following month). On April 1st and 2nd, Union forces commanded by Lieutenant General U.S. Grant launched a series of attacks on the Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] near Petersburg, Virginia, overunning the Confederate fortifications. As a result, General Robert E. Lee was forced to evacuate both that city and Richmond, ending the [[Siege of Petersubrg|nine month siege operations]]. Lee attempted to flee southwards to North Carolina to unite with other Confederate forces but was surrounded and forced to surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9th.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 70, 142&ndash144.</ref>

[[File:2008-08-16  Bennett Place historic site.jpg|thumb|right|Bennett Place, where the surrender of the Confederate [[Army of Tennessee]] took place on April 26th]]
In North Carolina, General Joseph Johnston was appointed commander of all Confederate forces in the state and ordered to defeat Union forces under Major General William T. Sherman. The resulting [[Carolinas Campaign]] culminated in the [[Battle of Bentonville]] on March 19th to 21st, in which the Confederates gained an initial advantage over one portion of the Union army but was forced to retreat when the rest of the army arrived. When he received news of Lee's surrender, Johnston also surrendered both his [[Army of Tennessee]] and the remaining Confederate forces in the [[Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida]] at the [[Bennett Place|Bennett Place, North Carolina]] on April 26th.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 238&ndash241.</ref>

In the Western Theater, Major General James Wilson lead his cavalry corps in a raid through Alabama and Georgia, destroying Confederate manufacturing plants and defeating Nathan Bedford Forrest at the [[Battle of Selma]].<ref>Trudeau, pp. 258-259.</ref> Around Mobile, Alabama (the last port still held by the Confederates), Major General Edward R.S. Canby started siege operations against the forts protecting the city on March 31st, first capturing Spanish Fort on April 8th and Fort Blakely the following day. The Confederates evacuated the city of Mobile without a fight on April 11th.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 6, 178&ndash179, 184.</ref> The capture of Mobile freed additional troops to assist Wilson's cavalry to the north. Both this and word of the Confederate surrenders in Virginia and North Carolina convinced Richard Taylor, commander of the Cofederate [[Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana]], to surrender to Canby at [[Citronelle, Alabama]] on May 4th. Forrest followed with the surrender of his command on May 9th.<ref>Trudeau, p. 259&ndash;261</ref>

Due to slow communications, Confederate forces in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]] didn't receive word of the Confederate surrenders in the east for several weeks. The last organized engagement of the war was fought at [[Battle of Palmito Ranch|Palmito Ranch]], Texas on May 13th and 14th. Confederate Lieutenant General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]], surrendered his forces at [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] on June 2nd, while Confederate forces in the [[Indian Territory]]surrendered on June 23rd at [[Doaksville, Indian Territory]].<ref>Trudeau, 340-341, 360.</ref> The Confederate raider [[CSS Shenandoah]], which had been in the Pacific Ocean during the months of April and May, only received word of the end of the war on August 2nd. Fearing execution as pirates if it surrendered to Union forces, the ship instead sailed to [[Liverpool]], United Kingdom, and surrendered to British authorities on November 6th.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 369&ndash;370.</ref>
