}}</ref>  Driven by the study of human psychology, Miles received his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (1991) from [[Queen<U+2019>s University]] in Kingston, Ontario and a Masters in Psychology from the [[University of Victoria]] (1994).

After working as a social worker counseling maximum-security inmates at the [[Kingston Penitentiary]] in Ontario, Miles turned his focus to management and leadership, receiving his Masters in Business Administration (1997) from [[Queen<U+2019>s University]] in Kingston, Ontario. 

Upon receiving his MBA, Miles worked for about a year as a consultant at Anderson Consulting before he arrived at Heidrick & Struggles in 1999.<ref name=Brady2010 />  Since arriving at Heidrick & Struggles as a research analyst, Miles moved on to become a vice chairman, and currently runs Leadership Advisory Services within the Leadership Consulting Practice, overseeing the firm<U+2019>s worldwide executive assessment/succession planning activities.<ref name=noname2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.heidrick.com/Consultants/Pages/12923.aspx |title=Stephen A.

==Career==
Miles' research centers on CEO succession and leadership. Using the [[360 degree evaluation]] process, Miles has helped companies such as BHP Billiton, Nokia, Best Buy, and Adobe assess their internal leadership capacity and develop emerging leaders within each company.<ref name=Brady2010 /> [[Marshall Goldsmith]], who is regarded as the dean of executive-coaching consultants, noted that Miles is <U+201C>near the top, especially given his age, [and] probably has a broader knowledge base than [Goldsmith]."<ref name=Brady2010 />  

In November 2010, Business Week magazine published a feature article on Miles, calling him the <U+201C>rising star of CEO consulting<U+201D> and <U+201C>the CEO whisperer<U+201D> and highlighting the successful work he has done in the area of CEO and [[executive coaching]]. [[Shantanu Narayen]], CEO of [[Adobe Systems]] has described Miles as <U+201C>wicked smart,<U+201D> while [[Marius Kloppers]], CEO of [[BHP Billiton]], has described him as <U+201C>fearless in a soft but determined sense.<U+201D><ref name=Brady2010 />

Miles and Stanford University Graduate School of Business Professor David Larcker have collaborated on a [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] case study on CEO succession planning, entitled <U+201C>Multimillionaire Matchmaker.<U+201D> In a 2010 research study,<ref>
