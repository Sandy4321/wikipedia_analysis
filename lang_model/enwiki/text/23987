'''Daniel Ken''' "'''Dan'''" '''Inouye''' ({{lang-ja|<U+4E95><U+4E0A> <U+5EFA>}}, ''Inoue Ken''; born September 7, 1924) is an American politician who currently serves as the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Hawaii]]. He has been a U.S. Senator since 1963 and, following the recent death of [[Ted Kennedy]], is currently the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|second-most-senior]] member after fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Robert Byrd]]. He is the third longest serving U.S Senator in history, after Robert Byrd and [[Strom Thurmond]]. He has continuously represented Hawaii in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] since it achieved [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1959, serving as Hawaii's first [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and later a U.S. Senator. Inouye was the first [[Japanese-American]] to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and later the first in the U.S. Senate. He is the third oldest U.S. Senator after [[Robert Byrd]] and [[Frank Lautenberg]]. He is also a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]].

==Personal history==
Born in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, Inouye is a [[Nisei]] (second-generation) Japanese-American and a son of Kame Imanaga and Hyotaro Inouye.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/inouye.htm inouye<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He grew up in the [[Bingham Tract]], a [[Chinese American|Chinese-American]] enclave within the predominantly Japanese-American community of Mo'ili'ili in Honolulu.

He was at the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]] in 1941 as a medical volunteer.<ref name=AP19680827>Associated Press (Chicago), ''"Keynoter Knows Sting of Bias, Poverty"''. St. Petersburg Times, August 27, 1968.</ref> 

[[File:First Lt Daniel Inouye.jpg|thumb|left|Inouye as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army]]
[[Image:cmoh army.jpg|80px|left|thumb|Medal of Honor]]
In 1943, when the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] dropped its ban on Japanese-Americans, Inouye curtailed his premedical studies at the [[University of Hawaii]] and enlisted in the Army.<ref name=AP19680827 /> He was assigned to the Nisei [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], which became the most-highly decorated unit in the history of the Army. During the [[World War II]] campaign in Europe he received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], the [[Purple Heart]], and the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], which was later upgraded, by President Clinton in June 2000, to the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-g-l.html Congressional Medal of Honor - World War II Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient 2nd Lt. Daniel K. Inouye, US Army 442nd Regimental Combat Team<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Inouye was promoted to the rank of sergeant within his first year, and he was given the role of platoon leader. He served in [[Italy]] in 1944 during the [[Rome-Arno Campaign]] before he was shifted to the [[Vosges Mountains]] region of [[France]], where he spent two weeks searching for the [[Lost Battalion (World War II)|Lost Battalion]], a [[Texas]] battalion that was surrounded by [[Germany|German]] forces. He was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant for his actions there. At one point while leading an attack a shot struck him in the chest directly above his heart, but the bullet was stopped by the two [[silver dollar]]s he happened to have stacked in his shirt pocket. He continued to carry the coins throughout the war in his shirt pocket as [[good luck charm]]s.

===Assault on Colle Musatello===
On April 21, 1945, Inouye was grievously wounded while leading an assault on a heavily-defended ridge near [[Terenzo]] called Colle Musatello. The ridge served as a strongpoint along the strip of German fortifications known as the [[Gothic Line]], which represented the last and most dogged line of German defensive works in Italy. As he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver, three German [[machine gun]]s opened fire from covered positions just 40 yards away, pinning his men to the ground. Inouye stood up to attack and was shot in the stomach; ignoring his wound, he proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest with [[hand grenades]] and fire from his [[M1 Thompson]] [[submachine gun]]. After being informed of the severity of his wound by his platoon sergeant, he refused treatment and rallied his men for an attack on the second machine gun position, which he also successfully destroyed before collapsing from blood loss. 

As his squad distracted the third machine gunner, Inouye crawled toward the final bunker, eventually drawing within 10 yards. As he raised himself up and cocked his arm to throw his last grenade into the fighting position, a German inside fired a [[rifle grenade]] that struck him on the right elbow, severing most of his arm and leaving the primed grenade reflexively "clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore". <ref name=moh>Sterner, C. Douglas. "Final Victory - the 442d RCT returns to Italy". <http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/a-medal-of-honor/>. Retrieved 1 NOV 2009.</ref> Inouye's horrified soldiers moved to his aid, but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. As the German inside the bunker reloaded his rifle, Inouye managed to successfully pry the live grenade from his useless right hand and transfer it to his left. As the German aimed his rifle to finish him off, Inouye managed at last to toss the grenade off-hand into the bunker and destroy it. He stumbled to his feet and continued forward, silencing the last German resistance with a one-handed burst from his Thompson before being wounded in the leg and tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. When he awoke to see the concerned men of his platoon hovering over him, his only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them return to their positions, since, as he pointed out, "nobody had called off the war".<ref name=moh></ref>

The remainder of Inouye's mutilated right arm was later [[amputated]] at a [[field hospital]] without proper anesthesia, as he had been given too much morphine at an aid station and it was feared any more would lower his blood pressure enough to kill him. <ref>http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5165.htm</ref> Inouye was initially awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross]] for his bravery in this action, with the award later being upgraded to the [[Medal of Honor]] by President Bill Clinton (alongside 21 other [[Nisei]] servicemen who served in the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]] and were believed to have been denied proper recognition of their bravery due to their race). His story, along with interviews with him about the war as a whole, were featured prominently in the 2007 [[Ken Burns]] documentary ''[[The War (documentary)|The War]]''.<ref>http://www.pbs.org/thewar/search_results.php?search_type=people&people_id=23&keyword=Daniel+Inouye</ref>

While recovering from WWII wounds and the [[amputation]] of his right [[forearm]] from the grenade wound (mentioned above) at [[Percy Jones Army Hospital]], Inouye met future [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]], then a fellow patient. Dole mentioned to Inouye that after the war he planned to go to Congress; Inouye beat him there by a few years. The two have remained lifelong friends. In 2003, the hospital was renamed the [[Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center]] in honor of the two WWII [[veteran]]s and another U.S. Senator and fellow WWII veteran who had stayed in the hospital, [[Philip Hart]].

In 2007, he was personally inducted as [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]] Chevalier by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. 

In February 2009, a bill was filed in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine House of Representatives]] by Rep. [[Antonio Diaz]] seeking to confer honorary [[Philippines|Filipino]] citizenship on Inouye, Senators [[Ted Stevens]] and [[Daniel Akaka]] and Representative [[Bob Filner]], for their role in securing the passage of [[Filipino_American#World_War_II_veteran_benefits|benefits for Filipino World War II veterans]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Leila Salaverria |title=4 US solons as honorary Filipinos |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090224-190786/4-US-solons-as-honorary-Filipinos |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-03-20 }}</ref>

===Family===
His wife of fifty-seven years, Maggie, died on March 13, 2006.  On May 24, 2008, he married [[Irene Hirano]] in a private ceremony in [[Beverly Hills, California]].  Ms. Hirano is president and chief executive officer of the [[Japanese American National Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]], California. According to the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'', she is 24 years Inouye's junior. Inouye's son Kenny was the guitarist for influential D.C. [[hardcore punk]] band [[Marginal Man]]<ref>http://www.goldsea.com/Personalities/Inspiring/inouye3.html</ref>

==Congressional career==
Although he lost his right arm in WWII, Inouye remained in the military until 1947 and was [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] with the rank of captain. Due to the loss of his arm, he abandoned his plans to become a surgeon<ref name=AP19680827 /> and returned to college to study political science under the [[GI Bill]]. He graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1950 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in political science. He earned his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] from [[The George Washington University Law School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1953 and was elected into the [[Phi Delta Phi]] legal fraternity. Soon afterward he was elected to the [[Incorporated territory|territorial]] legislature, of which he was a member until shortly before Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959. He won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as Hawaii's first full member, and took office on August 21, 1959, the same date Hawaii became a state; he was reelected in 1960.

In 1962 Inouye was elected to the U.S. Senate, succeeding fellow Democrat [[Oren E. Long]]. He is currently serving his eighth consecutive six-year term, having most recently run against Republican candidate [[Campbell Cavasso]] in 2004. He delivered the keynote address at the turbulent [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=AP19680827 /> and gained national attention for his service on the [[Senate Watergate Committee]]. He was chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence from 1975 until 1979, and chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs from 1987 until 1995 and from 2001 until 2003. Inouye was also involved in the [[Iran-Contra Affair|Iran-Contra]] investigations of the 1980s, chairing a special committee from 1987 until 1989.

In 2000, Inouye was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] by the Emperor of Japan in recognition of his long and distinguished career in public service.<ref>Daniel Inouye, Senate: [http://inouye.senate.gov/Who_is_Dan/Awards.cfm Awards]</ref>

In 2009, Inouye assumed leadership of the powerful [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]] after longtime chairman Robert Byrd stepped down.

===Gang of 14===
{{main|Gang of 14}}
On May 23, 2005, Inouye was a member of a [[bipartisan]] group of fourteen moderate senators, known as the [[Gang of 14]], to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial [[filibuster]], thus blocking the Republican leadership's attempt to implement the "[[nuclear option]]", a means of forcibly ending a filibuster. Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an "extraordinary circumstance", and the three-most-conservative Bush [[appellate court]] nominees ([[Janice Rogers Brown]], [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]]) would receive a vote by the full U.S. Senate.

==Medal of Honor citation==
''Rank and organization'': Second Lieutenant, U.S. Army, Company E, 442nd Infantry. ''Place and date'': San Terenzo, Italy, 21 April 1945. ''Birth'': 7 September 1924, Honolulu, Hawaii. ''Entered service at'':  Honolulu, Hawaii.

{{blockquote|'''Citation''': Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 21 April 1945, in the vicinity of San Terenzo, Italy. While attacking a defended ridge guarding an important road junction, Second Lieutenant Inouye skillfully directed his platoon through a hail of automatic weapon and small arms fire, in a swift enveloping movement that resulted in the capture of an artillery and mortar post and brought his men to within 40 yards of the hostile force. Emplaced in bunkers and rock formations, the enemy halted the advance with crossfire from three machine guns. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to within five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun nest. Although wounded by a sniper<U+2019>s bullet, he continued to engage other hostile positions at close range until an exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite the intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men were again deployed in defensive positions. In the attack, 25 enemy soldiers were killed and eight others captured. By his gallant, aggressive tactics and by his indomitable leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye enabled his platoon to advance through formidable resistance, and was instrumental in the capture of the ridge. Second Lieutenant Inouye<U+2019>s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.}}
