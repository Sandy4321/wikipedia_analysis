[[Skateboarding]] arrived in China in April, 1986 when American Skateboarder, Joe Eberling arrived in China to study Chinese at the Beijing Language Institute.  Joe says, "When I arrived in China, there wasn't even a word in Chinese for skateboard.  People were really interested in learning to ride, and in a few years Chinese skaters started appearing in almost every city I travelled to".<ref name=BeijingThisMonth>Li, Winnie.

''China Youthology'' February 6, 2009.</ref> Skateboarding has been slow to develop in China because of the lack of a strong preexisting street culture and of skating infrastructure; nevertheless, it's estimated that as of 2009 there are 40,000 to 50,000 skateboarders in China.<ref name=ChinaDaily>He Bolin.

Perhaps the most significant figure in the development of skateboarding in China has been Jeff Han (Han Minjie). After a decade-long career with a milk company, in 1999 Han quit and founded Fly Streetwear, the first skateshop in Shanghai.<ref name=ChinaYouthology/> Fly rapidly became one of the major retailers and distributors of counterfeit, pirated and factory leak skateboard and street culture brands in China, a position it maintains to this day, with a mixture of genuine and bogus products in their shops.  He also founded Gift Skateboards, a manufacturer that initially produced only boards for foreign brands but has now become the leading domestic skateboard brand;<ref name=GlobalTimes>Gold, Michael.

''Hypebeast'' May 15, 2007.</ref>

In 2009, MSC Skateboards was founded by a young Canadian kid.  Although MSC is not one of the more well known brands yet, it still had a huge impact in the skating community of Xian, China.  MSC is most dominant in Xi'an, as that is where the brand originated from. 
==Business==
Along with Jeff Han's companies, one of the oldest and most important Chinese skateboard companies is Shehui ({{zh|s=<U+793E><U+4F1A>|p= Sh<U+00E8>hu<U+00EC>}}; English: ''Society'') Skateboards.<ref name=SwCC>Chow, Jonathan. "[http://uschina.usc.edu/article@usct?skateboarding_with_chinese_characteristics_12079.aspx Skateboarding with Chinese Characteristics]." ''US-China Today'' June 20, 2008.</ref> Headquartered in Beijing, it was founded by Raph Cooper, a [[University of Southern California|USC]] alum who had studied abroad at [[Peking University]] in 2000.

A number of Western skate shoe brands have presences in China. These brands include Vans, Nike SB, Circa, Converse and Adidas. In the domain of skateboarding apparel, Jeff Han reports that
<blockquote>Vans is the No.1. Adidas is the new comer in China. I still remember that on the first opening day of Vans at Fly, we sold RMB 50,000 of Vans. As a matter of fact, before Vans<U+2019> official launch in China, it was already superbly popular in Beijing. Converse was replaced by Vans as the symbol of cool. Nike successfully launched some limited editions that are more expensive<U+2026><ref name=ChinaYouthology/></blockquote>
Han regards [[Nike Skateboarding]]'s history in China as a major success story. Though not respected as a skate brand at the time they launched in the Chinese market in 2004, through sponsorships of successful Chinese skateboarders such as Che Lin and Zeng Guanhao as well as intense local marketing efforts, they won broad recognition in China.

==Skateparks and other skating locations==
Chinese skateboarding champion Che Lin estimated in 2009 that there were fewer than ten skateparks in China. Finding this to be utterly insufficient, a prolific skateboarder in the 80s, Ahmed Taha donated $50,000 to Che Lin with the express purpose of building skate parks in the metropolitan area of Shanghai and Beijing. Taha stated, "It feels good to give back, I am too old and have sustained too many injuries to enjoy the sport myself but the joy it brings to the youths is unmistakably amazing."<ref name=ChinaDaily/>

===Shanghai===
SMP Skatepark, the largest [[skatepark]] in the world, is located on the outskirts of [[Shanghai]] in [[Xinjiangwancheng (Shanghai Metro)|New Jiangwan City]]. It was completed in 2005 and is more than 12,000 square meters in size, containing the world's biggest vert ramp, the world's largest concrete skate bowl, and a 5,000-seat stadium.<ref name=SwCC/> Despite the publicity of the high-profile events that have taken place there, it has attracted sparse crowds.<ref name=GlobalTimes/>

YuanShen skatepark was created when the red metal ramps from the SMP skatepark were transferred to the YuanShen Stadium in 2008.  These metal ramps were originally used as a competition course in the stadium portion of the SMP skatepark.  The skatepark is often referred to as the Red SMP skatepark.  Top Toys took over management of YuanShen skatepark located on Line 6 on June 2010 when they opened a skateshop on location.

===Beijing===
The most popular skating location in Beijing is the large Woodward Beijing located in the rural southern 6th ring road. It is one of the largest indoor skate parks in the world, and it hosts the notorious Van's Night. There are also several skateparks. Ezone Sk8 Park in [[Fangzhuang]] hosts Andrew Guan's (Guan Mu's) Kicker Club, a nationwide skateboarding club with approximately 200 members in Beijing.<ref name=BeijingThisMonth/><ref name=InsidersGuide>Pillsbury, Adam, ed. ''The Insider's Guide to Beijing, 2005-2006'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=Uu3EF-2bmXsC&pg=PT421#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 462]. Beijing: True Run Media, 2005.</ref> (Guan runs a [http://www.kickerclub.com/ blog] named after his club.) Sk8 Warehouse, founded in 2009, is an indoor park in an industrial complex just north of Shuangjing Bridge.ref name=GlobalTimes/> Honglinjin Park, in [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]], also contains a skatepark. In May 2010, Woodward Youth Action Sports Camp is slated to open in [[Daxing District]];<ref name=GlobalTimes/> it will contain facilities for skateboarding, BMX, and motocross and represents a government investment of $21.96 million.<ref name=ChinaDaily/> There are also plenty of small skateparks in the Shunyi area inside the villas such as Yosemite and Dragon Bay villa

===Shenzhen===
[[Shenzhen]] is the most popular destination for visiting pros. Spots in Shenzhen have been featured in videos by Nike Skateboarding, [[Zero Skateboards]], and [[Transworld Skateboarding]]. Shenzhen is known for its smooth black marble ledges and [[cops]] and [[security guards]] who are largely indifferent to skateboarding. In 2009, Shenzhen Museum became the first skateproofed spot in Shenzhen when authorities placed flower pots around the central ledge.<ref>http://www.stateofskate.com/skate-spots/skatestoppers-arrive-in-shenzhen/#more-252</ref>
