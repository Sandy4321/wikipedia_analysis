[[Boone Carlyle]] ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) returned for the fifth time since his death [[Do No Harm (Lost)|late in the first season]].

==Plot==
[[Image:Billydeenikki.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Nikki and Paulo|Nikki]] talking to [[Billy Dee Williams]]]]
The flashbacks begin with [[Nikki and Paulo|Niki Fernandez]] ([[Kiele Sanchez]]) acting in a popular, ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''-like TV show ''Expos<U+00E9>'' filmed in [[Sydney, Australia]], in which she is a guest star. She is also having an affair with the [[septuagenarian]] executive producer, Howard Zuckerman, who is very wealthy, while [[Nikki and Paulo|Paulo]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) works as his chef. Paulo poisons Zuckerman's food, and the couple steals his diamonds, which are worth $8 million. The couple plan on returning to the [[United States]] on Oceanic Flight 815, encountering [[Boone Carlyle]] ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) and [[Shannon Rutherford]] ([[Maggie Grace]]) at the airport. Upon surviving the plane crash, Nikki and Paulo realize that they have lost the bag with the diamonds. Nikki consults [[Characters of Lost#Dr. Leslie Arzt|Dr. Leslie Arzt]] ([[Daniel Roebuck]]), who tells her of a spider with the ability to paralyze people. He also gives her a map which leads them to [[DHARMA Initiative stations#Station 5: The Pearl|The Pearl]] and the Nigerian Plane; they explore neither. When [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) mentions that she found luggage from the plane in a lake, Paulo finds the diamonds, but does not tell Nikki. Instead, he hides them in the toilet at The Pearl and overhears a conversation between [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) and [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]). The two accidentally leave behind a walkie-talkie that Paulo takes. Later, when [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]), [[Desmond Hume]] ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]), Nikki and Paulo [[The Cost of Living (Lost)|visit The Pearl]], Paulo retrieves the diamonds by pretending to use the bathroom. Nikki figures out that Paulo has found the diamonds and decides to lure him into a trap. When he denies that he has the diamonds she unleashes one of the paralyzing spiders on him. She finds the diamonds and Paulo apologizes, claiming that he did it so that she would not end their relationship. As Nikki stands in a state of regret, the pheromones of the female spider attract a group of the male spiders of the same species and she is bitten on her leg. She buries the diamonds and sprints to the beach.

Nikki then runs onto the beach, before collapsing where [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]) and [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) are playing [[ping pong]]. As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something barely audible. She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said before she died and come to the conclusion that she said, "Paulo lies", although she actually said "paralyzed". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a [[walkie talkie]] in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because "they're worthless here." The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave, [[Premature burial|burying her and Paulo alive]].

"Expos<U+00E9>" was the fourteenth episode of the series directed by [[Stephen Williams (director)|Stephen Williams]]. The episode was written by [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz]], the pair had previously written eight other episodes of ''Lost''.

Nikki and Paulo were killed off due to being disliked by much of ''Lost''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fan base. [[Show runner]] [[Damon Lindelof]] admitted that the couple were "universally despised" by fans.<ref name=ew>Jensen, Jeff & Snierson, Dan, ([[February 8]], [[2007]]) "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20011203_3,00.html 'Lost' and Found]," ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.  Retrieved on [[July 23]], [[2008]].</ref> Lindelof explained that "back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could have gotten away with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had to clean up the mess." Originally, there was going to be an entire flashback episode in which Nikki was going to be a crime-fighting [[stripper]], only to have be revealed that she was actually an actress. The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in [[December]] of [[2006]].<ref name="ew2">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20034817,00.html |title='Lost' in Transition |accessdate=2008-07-23 |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |coauthors= |date=2007-04-13 |work= |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref> Although actress [[Kiele Sanchez]] said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Todays-News/Lost-Boss-Explains/800011706|title="Lost Boss Explains Last Night's Double Demise"|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired, Santoro said in an interview with the Brazilian ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that his character was going die in the middle of the third season.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u67403.shtml |title=Santoro Says That His Character Dies in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Season of 'Lost' |accessdate=2008-07-27 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=2007-01-10 |work= |publisher=[[Rolling Stone#Internation editions|''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Brazilian edition]]}}</ref> Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the ABC show, ''[[Football Wives]]''.<ref name="Zap2It News">{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-pilotcasting-kielesanchezfootballwives,0,4345613.story |title='Lost's' Sanchez Playing 'Football' |accessdate=2008-07-27 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=2007-02-14 |work= |publisher=Zap2It News}}</ref>
