{{nihongo|'''''A Mother Should be Loved'''''|<U+6BCD><U+3092><U+604B><U+306F><U+305A><U+3084>|Haha o Kowazuya}} is a 1934 Japanese film directed by [[Yasujir<U+014D> Ozu]], the first and last reels of which have been lost. Ozu had wanted to name the film ''Tokyo Twilight'', but studio executives preferred a title that referenced motherhood, a popular theme in Japanese cinema at the time of release<ref>{{cite book|last=Richie|first=Donald|title=Ozu|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-02445-1}}</ref>.

The film tells of the strained relationship between a mother and her two sons after the death of the family patriarch. Ozu once said that he remembered making this early film "not because it was any good, but because my father died while I was making it"<ref>{{cite book|last=Richie|first=Donald|title=Ozu|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-02445-1}}</ref>.

==Plot==

Mr Kajiwara ([[Yukichi Iwata]]) promises his two sons, Sadao and Kosaku, a weekend trip to the beach. Later that day his wife, Chieko ([[Mitsuko Yoshikawa]]), receives a phone call informing her that her husband has collapsed at work.

After Kajiwara's funeral, his friend Okazuki visits Chieko, asking her to continue to raise the eldest boy, Sadao, as if he were her own. It is revealed that Chieko was Kajiwara's second wife, and that Sadao is Kajiwara's son from his first marriage.

Several years later Okazuki visits Chieko again. Chieko tells him that she has just argued with Sadao because, when preparing materials for his university application, Sadao consulted his birth certificate and discovered the secret of his parentage. Okazuki explains to Sadao that the deception was necessary because it allowed Chieko to treat Sadao as her own son. At first Sadao complains that he feels tricked, but then tearfully apologizes to his mother.

Sadao persuades a friend on the university rowing team, Hattori ([[Chishu Ryu]]), to leave the whorehouse in which he has been living. He asks Chieko for a loan to pay Hattori's debts, but then discovers that Chieko has asked Kosaku to cancel an expensive trip he had been planning. Sadao tries to return the loan but Chieko refuses it, so he instead gives the money to Kosaku to pay for his trip. At first Chieko resists, but when the sons point out that she always treats Sadao more favorably than Kosaku, she relents.

While Kosaku is away, Sadao again argues with Chieko that she is treating the sons differently. Later, Kosaku asks Sadao why he made their mother upset. Kosako becomes angry and repeatedly strikes Sadao, who storms away. To explain Sadao's behavior, Chieko reveals the truth of his parentage to Kosaku.

The next day Chieko finds Sadao at the whorehouse and begs him to come home, but he refuses. After Chieko leaves, a cleaner asks Sadao to reconsider. Moved by her words, he returns home and the family is reconciled.

==Cast==

[[Yukichi Iwata]]'s performance as Mr Kajiwara was confined to the first reel of the picture and, along with the rest of the first reel, has been lost. However, his photograph is viewed multiple times by Kajiwara's widow, played by regular Ozu collaborator [[Mitsuko Yoshikawa]]. [[Seiichi Kato]] appears as young Sadao, again playing [[Mitsuko Yoshikawa]]'s son as he had two years earlier in ''[[I Was Born, But...]]''. [[Choko Iida]] has a small part as the cleaner who convinces Sadao to forgive his mother: Iida would later take the lead in Ozu's first talkie, [[The Only Son (1936 film)|The Only Son]]. [[Koji Mitsui]], playing the teenage Kosaku, is credited as [[Koji Mitsui|Hideo Mitsui]].
