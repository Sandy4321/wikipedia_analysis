'''Sargon of Akkad''', also known as '''Sargon the Great''' "The Great King" ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''<U+0160>arru-k<U+012B>nu'', meaning "the true [[sharrum|king]]" or "the king is legitimate"), was an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] emperor famous for his conquest of the [[Sumer]]ian city-states in the 23rd and 22nd centuries BC.<ref>"Sargon" was likely a regnal name; his given name is unknown. For a detailed discussion of Sargon's name, see Lewis 1984:277<U+2013>292.</ref> The founder of the Dynasty of Akkad, Sargon reigned from 2270 to 2215&nbsp;BC ([[short chronology]]).<ref>This according to the [[Sumerian king list]], the actual dates of Sargon's reign are impossible to determine with certainty; ''see, e.g.,'' Kramer, ''The Sumerians passim''.</ref> He became a prominent member of the royal court of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], killing the king and usurping his throne before embarking on the quest to conquer Mesopotamia.

Sargon's vast empire is known to have extended from [[Elam]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], including Mesopotamia, parts of modern-day [[Iran]] and [[Syria]], and possibly parts of [[Anatolia]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]]. He ruled from a new capital, Akkad (Agade), which the [[Sumerian king list]] claims he built (or possibly renovated), on the left bank of the [[Euphrates]].<ref>Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' 1963:60<U+2013>61. Akkad was probably located between [[Sippar]] and Kish.</ref> He is sometimes regarded as the first person in recorded history to create a multiethnic, centrally ruled [[empire]], although the [[Sumer]]ians [[Lugal-anne-mundu]] and [[Lugal-Zage-Si|Lugal-zage-si]] also have a claim. His dynasty controlled Mesopotamia for around a century and a half.<ref>Van der Mieroop 64<U+2013>72.</ref>

==Origins and rise to power==
The story of Sargon's birth and childhood is given in the "Sargon legend", a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text purporting to be Sargon's biography. The extant versions are incomplete, but the surviving fragments name Sargon's father as [[La'ibum]]. After a [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], the text skips to [[Ur-Zababa]], king of Kish, who awakens after a dream, the contents of which are not revealed on the surviving portion of the tablet. For unknown reasons, Ur-Zababa appoints Sargon as his [[cupbearer]]. Soon after this, Ur-Zababa invites Sargon to his chambers to discuss a dream of Sargon's, involving the favor of the goddess [[Inanna]] and the drowning of Ur-Zababa by the goddess. Deeply frightened, Ur-Zababa orders Sargon murdered by the hands of Beli<U+0161>-tikal, the chief smith, but Inanna prevents it, demanding that Sargon stop at the gates because of his being "polluted with blood." When Sargon returns to Ur-Zababa, the king becomes frightened again, and decides to send Sargon to king [[Lugal-zage-si]] of [[Uruk]] with a message on a clay tablet asking him to slay Sargon.<ref>[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr214.htm "The Sargon Legend." ''The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.''] [[Oxford University]], 2006. ''cf.'' the Greek myth of [[Bellerophon]]. A similar account appears in the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] legend of [[Amleth]], which [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] adapted in ''[[Hamlet]]''.</ref> The legend breaks off at this point; presumably, the missing sections described how Sargon becomes king.<ref>Cooper 67<U+2013>82.</ref>

The [[Sumerian king list]] relates: "In Agade [Akkad], Sargon, whose father was a gardener,<ref>[[Thorkild Jacobsen]], in his edition of the ''Sumerian King List'', marked this clause as a lacunae, indicating his uncertainty about its meaning. (''The Sumerian King List'', Assyriological Studies, No. 11 (Chicago: Oriental Institute, 1939), p. 111)</ref> the cupbearer of Ur-Zababa, became king, the king of Agade, who built Agade; he ruled for 56 years."<ref>Confusingly, Ur-Zababa and Lugal-zage-si are both listed as kings, but several generations apart.</ref> The claim that Sargon was the original founder of Akkad has come into question in recent years, with the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and dated to the first year of [[Enshakushanna]], who almost certainly preceded him.<ref>Van de Mieroop, ''Cuneiform Texts'' 75.</ref> This claim of the king list had been the basis for earlier speculation by a number of scholars that Sargon was an inspiration for the biblical figure of [[Nimrod]].<ref name="Levin 350<U+2013>356; Poplicha 303<U+2013>317.">Levin 350<U+2013>356; Poplicha 303<U+2013>317.</ref> The ''Weidner Chronicle'' states that it was Sargon who built [[Babylon]] "in front of Akkad."<ref>Grayson 19:51.</ref><ref name = "Livius"/> The ''Chronicle of Early Kings'' likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon "dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade."<ref name = "Livius"/><ref>Grayson 20:18<U+2013>19</ref> More recently, some researchers have stated that those sources may refer to [[Sargon&nbsp;II]] of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] rather than Sargon of Akkad.<ref>Stephanie Dalley, Babylon as a Name for Other Cities Including
Nineveh, in [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc62.pdf] Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Oriental Institute SAOC 62, pp. 25<U+2013>33, 2005</ref>

A [[Neo-Assyrian]] text from the 7th century BC purporting to be Sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess. In the Neo-Assyrian account Sargon's birth and his early childhood are described thus:

{{cquote|My mother was a high priestess, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azupiranu, which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My high priestess mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki, the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was a gardener, [[Ishtar]] granted me her love, and for four and&nbsp;... years I exercised kingship.<ref>King 1907: 87<U+2013>96</ref>}}

The image of Sargon as a castaway set adrift on a river resembles the better-known birth narrative of [[Moses]]. Scholars such as [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Otto Rank]] have compared the 7th century BC Sargon account with the obscure births of other heroic figures from history and mythology, including [[Karna]], [[Oedipus]], [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Telephus]], [[Semiramis]], [[Perseus]], [[Romulus]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Jesus]], and others.<ref>Rank ''passim''; MacKenzie 126. While Moses is supposed to have lived centuries after Sargon, the exact chronological relationship between the two narratives is uncertain. In any event, the account of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] turns the theme on its head&mdash; than a royal fostered by commoners before rediscovering his royal blood, Moses is the son of slaves who is fostered by the daughter of [[Pharaoh]]. ''See, e.g.'' Lewis 211<U+2013>272.</ref>

==Formation of the Akkadian Empire==
{{see also|Battle of Uruk}}
[[Image:Orientmitja2300aC.png|thumb|left|350px|The empire of Sargon, late 24th century BC]]

After coming to power in [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], Sargon soon attacked [[Uruk]], which was ruled by [[Lugal-Zage-Si]] of [[Umma]].<ref>While Sargon is often credited with the first true empire, Lugal-Zage-Si preceded him; after coming to power in Umma he had conquered or otherwise come into possession of [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]], and [[Lagash]]. Lugal-Zage-Si claimed rulership over lands as far away as the Mediterranean. See Beaulieu 43.</ref> He captured Uruk and dismantled its famous walls. The defenders seem to have fled the city, joining an army led by fifty [[ENSI|ensis]] from the provinces. This Sumerian force fought two pitched battles against the Akkadians, as a result of which the remaining forces of Lugal-Zage-Si were routed.<ref>Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' 61.; Van de Mieroop, ''History'' 64<U+2013>66.</ref> Lugal-Zage-Si himself was captured and brought to Nippur; Sargon inscribed on the pedestal of a statue (preserved in a later tablet) that he brought Lugal-Zage-Si "in a dog collar to the gate of Enlil."<ref name="Oppenheim 267">Oppenheim 267.</ref> Sargon pursued his enemies to [[Ur]] before moving eastwards to Lagash, to the [[Persian Gulf]], and thence to Umma. He made a symbolic gesture of washing his weapons in the "lower sea" (Persian Gulf) to show that he had conquered Sumer in its entirety.<ref name="Oppenheim 267"/>

Another victory Sargon celebrated was over Kashtubila, king of [[Kazalla]]. According to one ancient source, Sargon laid the city of Kazalla to waste so effectively "that the birds could not find a place to perch away from the ground."<ref>Oppenheim 266.</ref>

To help limit the chance of revolt in [[Sumer]] he appointed a court of 5,400 men to "share his table" (i.e., to administer his empire).<ref>Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' 61.</ref> These 5,400 men may have constituted Sargon's army.<ref>Frayne 31.</ref> The governors chosen by Sargon to administer the main city-states of Sumer were Akkadians, not Sumerians.<ref>Van der Mieroop, ''History'' 62<U+2013>68.</ref> The [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Akkadian language]] became the ''lingua franca'', the official language of inscriptions in all [[Mesopotamia]], and of great influence far beyond. Sargon's empire maintained trade and diplomatic contacts with kingdoms around the [[Arabian Sea]] and elsewhere in the Near East. Sargon's inscriptions report that ships from [[Magan]], [[Meluhha]], and [[Dilmun]], among other places, rode at anchor in his capital of Agade.<ref>Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' 62, 289<U+2013>291.</ref>

The former religious institutions of Sumer, already well-known and emulated by the Semites, were respected. Sumerian remained, in large part, the language of religion and Sargon and his successors were patrons of the Sumerian cults. Sargon styled himself "anointed priest of [[Anu]]" and "great ''ensi'' of [[Enlil]]",<ref>''See, e.g.,'' Van der Mieroop, ''History'' 67<U+2013>68.</ref> 

[[Enheduanna]], the author of several Akkadian [[hymn]]s is thought to be the first author known by name. She is identified as Sargon's daughter, was made priestess of [[Nanna]], the moon-god of Ur and was deified upon her death.

==Wars in the northwest and east==
Shortly after securing Sumer, Sargon embarked on a series of campaigns to subjugate the entire [[Fertile Crescent]]. According to the ''[[Babylonian Chronicles#List of Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles|Chronicle of Early Kings]]'', a later [[Babylonian]] historiographical text:

{{cquote|[Sargon] had neither rival nor equal. His splendor, over the lands it diffused. He crossed the sea in the east. In the eleventh year he conquered the western land to its farthest point. He brought it under one authority. He set up his statues there and ferried the west's booty across on barges. He stationed his court officials at intervals of five double hours and ruled in unity the tribes of the lands. He marched to Kazallu and turned Kazallu into a ruin heap, so that there was not even a perch for a bird left.<ref name = "Livius">[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc20/kings.html#1 Chronicle of Early Kings at Livius.org.] Translation adapted from A.K. Grayson, ''Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles'' (1975) and Jean-Jacques Glassner, ''Mesopotamian Chronicles'' (Atlanta, 2004).</ref>}}

Sargon captured [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Jarmut|Yarmuti]], and [[Ebla]] as far as the [[Lebanon|Cedar Forest]] ([[Amanus]]) and the silver mountain ([[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]]). The Akkadian Empire secured [[trade routes]] and supplies of wood and [[precious metals]] could be safely and freely floated down the [[Euphrates]] to Akkad.<ref>Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' ''passim''.</ref>

In the east, Sargon defeated an invasion by the four leaders of [[Elam]], led by the king of [[Awan dynasty|Awan]]. Their cities were sacked; the governors, viceroys and kings of [[Susa]], [[Marhasi|Barhashe]], and neighboring districts became vassals of Akkad, and the [[Akkadian language]] made the official language of international discourse.<ref>It remained so for several centuries; the [[Amarna letters]] of the 14th century BC were largely written in Akkadian.</ref> During Sargon's reign, Akkadian was standardized and adapted for use with the [[cuneiform script]] previously used in the [[Sumerian language]]. A style of [[calligraphy]] developed in which text on clay tablets and cylinder seals was arranged amidst scenes of mythology and ritual.<ref>''Britannica''.</ref>

==Later reign==
The text known as ''Epic of the King of the Battle'' depicts Sargon advancing deep into the heart of [[Anatolia]] to protect Akkadian and other Mesopotamian merchants from the exactions of the King of [[Burushanda]] (Purshahanda).<ref>The oldest extant text was found on an Akkadian-language tablet in the [[Amarna]] archives; translations have since been discovered in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]. Postgate 216.</ref> The same text mentions that Sargon crossed the Sea of the West ([[Mediterranean Sea]]) and ended up in Kuppara.<ref>Possibly the Akkadian word for [[Keftiu]], an ancient locale usually associated with Crete or [[Cyprus]]. See Wainright 197<U+2013>212; Strange 395<U+2013>396; Vandersleyen 209.</ref>

Famine and war threatened Sargon's empire during the latter years of his reign. The ''Chronicle of Early Kings'' reports that revolts broke out throughout the area under the last years of his overlordship:

{{cquote|Afterward in his [Sargon's] old age all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad; and Sargon went onward to battle and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed. Afterward he attacked the land of [[Subartu]] in his might, and they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled that revolt, and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed, and he brought their possessions into Akkad. The soil from the trenches of [[Babylon]] he removed, and the boundaries of Akkad he made like those of Babylon. But because of the evil which he had committed, the great lord [[Marduk]] was angry, and he destroyed his people by famine. From the rising of the sun unto the setting of the sun they opposed him and gave him no rest.<ref>Botsforth 27<U+2013>28. However Oppenheim translates the last sentence as "From the East to the West he [i.e. Marduk] alienated (them) from him and inflicted upon (him as punishment) that he could not rest (in his grave)." ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p. 266</ref>}}

Later literature proposes that the rebellions and other troubles of Sargon's later reign were the result of sacrilegious acts committed by the king. Modern consensus is that the veracity of these claims are impossible to determine, as disasters were virtually always attributed to sacrilege inspiring divine wrath in ancient Mesopotamian literature.<ref>''Britannica''</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Stele Naram Sim Louvre Sb4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stele of [[Naram-Sin]], Sargon's grandson, celebrating his victory against the [[Lullubi]] from [[Zagros]]]]

Sargon died, according to the short chronology, around 2215&nbsp;BC. His empire immediately revolted upon hearing of the king's death. Most of the revolts were put down by his son and successor [[Rimush]], who reigned for nine years and was followed by another of Sargon's sons, [[Manishtushu]] (who reigned for 15 years).<ref>Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' 61<U+2013>63; Roux 155.</ref> Sargon was regarded as a model by Mesopotamian kings for some two millennia after his death. The Assyrian and Babylonian kings who based their empires in Mesopotamia saw themselves as the heirs of Sargon's empire. Kings such as [[Nabonidus]] (r. 556<U+2013>539&nbsp;BC) showed great interest in the history of the Sargonid dynasty, and even conducted excavations of Sargon's palaces and those of his successors.<ref>Oates 162.</ref> Indeed, such later rulers may have been inspired by the king's conquests to embark on their own campaigns throughout the Middle East. The Neo-Assyrian Sargon text challenges his successors thus:

{{cquote|The black-headed peoples [Sumerians] I ruled, I governed; mighty mountains with axes of bronze I destroyed. I ascended the upper mountains; I burst through the lower mountains. The country of the sea I besieged three times; [[Dilmun]] I captured. Unto the great Dur-ilu I went up, I&nbsp;... I altered&nbsp;... Whatsoever king shall be exalted after me,&nbsp;... Let him rule, let him govern the black-headed peoples; mighty mountains with axes of bronze let him destroy; let him ascend the upper mountains, let him break through the lower mountains; the country of the sea let him besiege three times; Dilmun let him capture; To great Dur-ilu let him go up.<ref>Barton 310, as modernized by [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/2300sargon1.html J. S. Arkenberg].</ref>}}

Another source attributed to Sargon the challenge "now, any king who wants to call himself my equal, wherever I went [conquered], let him go."<ref>Nougayrol 169.</ref>

Stories of Sargon's power and that of his empire may have influenced the body of folklore that was later incorporated into the [[Bible]]. A number of scholars have speculated that Sargon may have been the inspiration for the biblical figure of [[Nimrod]], who figures in the [[Book of Genesis]] as well as in [[midrash]]ic and [[Talmud]]ic literature.<ref name="Levin 350<U+2013>356; Poplicha 303<U+2013>317."/> The Bible mentions Akkad as being one of the first city-states of Nimrod's kingdom, but does not explicitly state that he built it.<ref>Genesis 10:10. In the Sumerian king list, Sargon is credited with the construction of the city, but see above for controversy surrounding this assertion.</ref>

==Family==
[[File:Akkadkings.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Chart of the Royal House of Akkad]]

The name of Sargon's main wife [[Tashlultum]] and those of a number of his children are known to us. His daughter [[Enheduanna]], who flourished during the late 24th and early 23rd centuries BC, was a priestess who composed ritual hymns.<ref>Schomp 81.</ref> Many of her works, including her ''Exaltation of [[Inanna]]'', were in use for centuries thereafter.<ref>Schomp 81; Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'' 351; Hallo ''passim''.</ref> Sargon was succeeded by his son, [[Rimush (Akkad)|Rimush]]; after Rimush's death another son, [[Manishtushu]], became king. Two other sons, [[Shu-Enlil]] (Ibarum) and [[Ilaba'is-takal]] (Abaish-Takal), are known.<ref>Frayne 3637.</ref>
