The '''Farnham Farm''' is historic farm on [[Prudence Island]] in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]]. 

The farm was started by the Dennis family{{Who|date=May 2008}} after the original farms on Prudence Island were burned and destroyed by the British during the [[American Revolution]] around the time of the [[Battle of Rhode Island]]. The farm contains several extant structures including a [[house]] (ca. [[1805]]), [[barn]] (ca. [[1850]]), [[milk house]], [[field]]s, [[garden]], [[woodland]], [[orchard]], and stone walls.  The Dennis family sold the house to the Farnhams{{Who|date=May 2008}} in [[1867]]. The site was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2006.
