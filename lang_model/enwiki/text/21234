==Route description==
The route begins at US-6 south of [[Helper, Utah|Helper]] in [[Spring Glen, Utah|Spring Glen]] as Spring Glen Road. Classified as a rural major collector, it crosses Spring Glen Creek as it heads north toward its northern terminus at SR-157, spanning a distance of {{convert|1.4|mi|km}}.<ref name="reference"/>

==History==
State Route 139 was originally established in 1933 as the road from former Route 8 (now [[US-6 (UT)|US-6]]) west to [[Consumers, Utah|Consumers]], a distance of about {{convert|13.3|mi|km}}.<ref name="resolutions"/> In 1969, SR-139 was extended east past US-6 and north through Spring Glen to meet [[State Route 157 (Utah)|State Route 157]], eight years after SR-157 had been extended north from Spring Glen to Helper.<ref name="resolutions"/><ref name="157 resolutions">{{cite web|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609190927191|title=State Route 157 highway resolutions|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=November 2008}}</ref> The route was significantly shortened in 1975, with the {{convert|13.3|mi|km}} west of US-6 being deleted from the state highway system, leaving SR-139 as a short connector between US-6 and SR-157.<ref name="resolutions"/> In 1978, SR-139 was lengthened by {{convert|0.1|mi|km}} when reconstruction of US-6 in the area necessitated moving its intersection with SR-139 southward, resulting in the current alignment.<ref name="resolutions"/>
