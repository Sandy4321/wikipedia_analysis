The '''Aschentalshalbe''' is a mountain ridge between the [[G<U+00F6>deckekopf]] and [[Adlersberg (Harz)|Adlersberg]] (to the west) and the [[Gro<U+00DF>er Knollen]] to the south. It lies south of the village of [[Sieber (Herzberg am Harz)|Sieber]] in the district of [[Landkreis Osterode am Harz|Osterode]] in the German state of [[Lower Saxony]] and comprises three peaks:

* west: 667 m with a view of the Sieber
* centre: 685 m is the highest
* east: 627 m with views to the south

The [[Harz Club]] trail no. 15 G runs over these three summits. The Aschentalshalbe is also the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] between the [[Sieber (river)|Sieber]] and the [[Oder (Harz)|Oder]]. 

The Aschentalshalbe was named after the ''Aschental'' ("Aschen valley"), a neighbouring valley of the ''Breitental'', in which the [[Tiefenbeek]] flows.
