Vishniac was an extremely diverse photographer, an accomplished [[biology|biologist]] and a knowledgeable collector and teacher of [[History of art|art history]]. Throughout his life, he made significant scientific contributions to [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]] and [[time-lapse|time-lapse photography]]. Vishniac was very interested in history, especially that of his ancestors. In turn, he was strongly tied to his Jewish roots and was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] later in life.<ref name=roman>ICP Library of Photographers. ''Roman Vishniac''. Grossman Publishers, New York. 1974.</ref>

Roman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photography: his pictures from the ''[[shtetl]]ach'' and Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and images of microscopic biology. He is known for his book ''A Vanished World'', published in 1983, which was one of the first such pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe from that period, and also for his great humanism, respect and awe for life, sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Roman  was born in his grandparents' ''[[dacha]]'' outside [[Saint Petersburg]], in the town of [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], and grew up in [[Moscow]].<ref name=bionote>Kohn, Mara Vishniac, Biographical Note (1992). ''To Give them Light: The Legacy of Roman Vishniac''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993. ISBN 0-671-63872-6.</ref> To live in this city was [[History of the Jews in Russia#Pogroms|a right granted to few Jews]] but Roman could live there because his father, Solomon Vishniac, was a wealthy manufacturer of umbrellas, and his mother, Manya, was the daughter of affluent diamond dealers (Roman also had a sister, Katja<ref name=berlin>J<U+00FC>disches Museum Berlin (2005). ''Roman Vishniac's Berlin''. Editors: Mara Vishniac Kohn, James Howard Fraser and Aubrey Pomerance. Published by Nicolaische Verlagsbuchhandlung.</ref>). During the summer months; however, the Vishniacs would leave: Moscow often became uncomfortably hot and the family would retreat to a ''dacha'' a few miles outside of that city.

As a child, Roman Vishniac was fascinated by [[biology]] and [[photography]], and his room was filled with "plants, insects, fish and small animals".<ref name=concern>Vishniac, Roman. ''The Concerns of Roman Vishhniac: Man, Nature and Science''.</ref> On his seventh birthday, he got a [[microscope]] from his grandmother, to which he promptly hooked up a camera, and by which he photographed the muscles in a [[cockroach]]'s leg at 150 times magnification. Young Vishniac used this microscope extensively, viewing and photographing everything he could find, from dead insects to animal [[scale (zoology)|scales]], to [[pollen]] and [[protozoa]].<ref name=roman /> 

Until the age of ten, Vishniac was [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]]; from ten to seventeen, he attended a private school at which he earned a gold medal for scholarship.<ref name=wilson>"Roman Vishniac". ''Current Biography'' (1967).</ref> Beginning in 1914, he spent six years at Shanyavsky Institute (now University) in Moscow. While enrolled there, he served in the [[Tsar]]ist, [[Russian Provisional Government|Kerensky]] and [[Military history of the Soviet Union|Soviet armies]]. At the Institute, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in [[zoology]] and became an assistant professor of biology.<ref name=concern /> As a graduate student, he worked with prestigious biologist [[Nikolai Koltzoff]], experimenting with inducing [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] in [[axolotl]], a species of aquatic [[salamander]]. While his experiments were a success, Vishniac was not able to publish a paper detailing his findings due to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|chaos in Russia]] and his results were eventually independently duplicated. In spite of this, he went on to take a three-year course in [[medicine]].<ref name=roman />

=== Berlin ===
In 1918, Roman Vishniac's immediate family moved to [[Berlin]] because of [[anti-Semitism]] spurred by the [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]]. Roman followed them and, shortly after arriving, married Luta (Leah) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara and [[Wolf V. Vishniac|Wolf]].<ref name=family>Kohn, Mara Vishniac. [http://www.hias.org/WhoWeAre/120stories/59vishniac.pdf A Photographer of a Vanished World and his Family]. [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society|HIAS]]. Accessed January 1, 2006.</ref> Roman Vishniac supported his own budding family (and sometimes his parents as well) by working at various jobs.<!--disputed by Mara--> In his free time, he studied [[Eastern art history|Far Eastern Art]] at the [[University of Berlin]]<!--Maybe completed doctoral studied and not given degree, but Mara denies this-->. Vishniac researched [[endocrinology]] and [[optics]], and did some photography (''see right''). In Berlin, he also initiated his [[public speaking]] career by joining the [[Salamander Club]], at which he often gave lectures on [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]].<ref name=roman />

In the 1930s, as anti-Semitism was growing in [[Germany]], Vishniac took his famed trips to [[Eastern Europe]], photographing the culture of poor Jews in mountainous villages and urban ghettos. For about four years (the exact period is debated), he would travel back and forth from Berlin to remote locations, taking thousands of pictures and living with whoever would take him in, at the same time supporting his family in Berlin. In 1939, his wife and children moved to [[Sweden]] to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in [[Nice]] that summer.<ref name=roman />

Vishniac returned to [[Paris]] in late summer 1940, and was arrested by Marshal [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]]'s police and interned at [[Camp du Ruchard]], a [[deportation|deportation camp]] in [[Clichy]]. This occurred because [[Latvia]], of which he was a citizen, had been subsumed into the [[Soviet Union]] and Vishniac was considered a "stateless person". After three months, as a result of his wife's efforts and aid from the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]], he obtained a [[Visa (document)|visa]] that allowed him to escape via [[Lisbon]] to the U.S. with his family. His father stayed behind and spent the war hidden in France; his mother died from cancer in 1941 while still in Nice.<ref name=roman /><ref name=berlin /><ref name=jewish>Jewish Museum Berlin (2005).

[[Image:EinsteinVishniac.jpg|thumb|upright|1942 portrait of [[Albert Einstein]] by Roman Vishniac. This is one of the best-known examples of his 1940s portraiture work.]]

The Vishniac family fled from [[Lisbon]] to [[New York City]] in 1940,<ref name=bionote /> arriving on [[New Year's Eve]]. Vishniac tried for days to get a job but failed: "For me, it was a time of distraction and fear."<ref name=roman /> He was [[multilingual]], speaking at least [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Yiddish]], but he could not yet speak any [[English language|English]] and thus had a difficult time.<ref name=weiner>Weiner, Jonathan (circa 1981). "Field of Vision". [[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]. pg 37.</ref> He managed to do some portraiture work with mostly foreign clients; but business was poor. It was during this time, in 1942, that he took one of his most celebrated portraits, that of [[Albert Einstein]]. He arrived at Einstein's home in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], getting into the scientist's study with the ruse of bringing regards from mutual friends in Europe, and photographed him while the scientist was not paying attention to him, occupied in thought. Einstein later called this portrait his favourite one of him. 

In 1946, Roman Vishniac divorced Luta, and the next year he married Edith Ernst, an old family friend. A few years later, he gave up portraiture and went on to do freelance work in the field of [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]].<ref name=roman />

Once in the United States, Roman Vishniac tried desperately to earn sympathy for impoverished Jews in [[Eastern Europe]]. When his work was exhibited at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1943,<ref name=misery>"Studies in Misery Shown". ''New York Times (1859-Current file);'' 2 February 1943; ProQuest Historical Newspapers pg. 21.</ref> he wrote to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] ([[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] at the time), asking her to visit the exhibit, but she did not.

[[Image:Vishniac reading.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vishniac, c. 1981]]

During his life, Vishniac was the subject and creator of many [[film]]s and [[documentary film|documentaries]]; the most celebrated of which was the Living Biology series. This consisted of seven films on [[cell biology]]; [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[Systems ecology|systems]]; [[embryology]]; [[evolution]]; [[genetics]]; [[ecology]]; [[botany]]; the animal world; and the [[microorganism|microbial]] world.

=== In Central and Eastern Europe ===
==== 1935<U+2013>1939 ====
Vishniac is best known for his dramatic photographs of poor and pious [[Jew]]s in cities and ''[[shtetl]]ach'' of [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name="alana"/> He was first commissioned to take these pictures by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] as part of a fundraising initiative, but Vishniac took a personal interest in this photography. He traveled back and forth from [[Berlin]] to the [[ghetto]]s of [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Lithuania]] for years after he worked for the Committee.<ref name=bionote />

Its publication contributed greatly to Vishniac's renown and represented the success of his 1930s trips.]]
Vishniac is said to have taken 16,000 photos in this period, every one of them a candid shot<ref name=weiner />; however, the veracity of both of these claims has been seriously challenged.<ref name="alana"/><ref name=polish>Roman Vishniac.

Roman Vishniac did not just want to preserve the memories of the Jews; he actively fought to increase awareness in the West of the worsening situation in Eastern Europe. "Through his photographs, he sought to alert the rest of the world to the horrors [of the Nazi persecution]", Mitgang.<ref name=mitgang /> In late 1938, for example, he sneaked into [[Zbaszyn]], an [[internment camp]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] near the border, where Jews awaited deportment to [[Poland]].

He then used photographs taken to prove the existence of such camps to the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=mitgang />

After Roman's death, more photographs were discovered, and the current exhibit in Berlin showcases such newly discovered photographs. The negatives of these were found at the end of rolls of film used by him in his scientific pursuits.

==== Style ====
Vishniac's photographs from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished.<ref name="alana"/> His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: "There is barely a hint of a smile on any of the faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient [[casement window]]s and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners."<ref name=fenyvesi>Fenyvesi, Charles.

[[Image:VishniacFlowers.jpg|thumb|''The Only Flowers of her Youth'', [[Warsaw]], 1938 by Roman Vishniac, one of his most famous]]

These pictures, all in black and white, were done with available light or sometimes a lantern,<ref name=weiner /> yet they are "amazingly crisp with surprising depth of field".<ref name=keppler>[[Herbert Keppler|Keppler, Herbert]]. "A vanished world". [[Modern Photography]], Sept 1984 v48 p92(1). Accessed January 3, 2006, from InfoTrac Web: OneFile A3409487</ref> Indeed, "There is a grainy realism to Vishniac's photographic style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby."<ref name=fenyvesi /> Vishniac is known to have exaggerated in composing the captions of his photographs, and in some cases he may have fabricated the stories behind them.<ref name="alana"/>

==== Impact ====
Vishniac's photographs from this period are widely commended and on permanent display in many museums. [[Edward Steichen]] places his pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] photographs, "among photography's finest documents of a time and place."'<ref name=schumach /> However, there has been criticism of Vishniac's work, focusing on the lack of diversity of his subjects in his work from Eastern Europe and quality of his composition. It has been argued that he should have also photographed wealthier Jews, in addition to the poor Jews in ghettos. Thornton criticized his photographs for their unprofessional qualities, citing "errors of focus and accidents of design, as when an unexplained third leg and foot protrudes from the long coat of a hurrying scholar."<ref name=thornton />

Vishniac's photographs have had a profound effect on Holocaust literature and have illustrated [[#Publications|many books]] about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case of ''The Only Flowers of her Youth'', the drama of the photograph inspired [[Miriam Nerlove]] to write a novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.<ref>All Readers.com (2005). [http://www.allreaders.com/Topics/Info_22255.asp Review Summary of ''Flowers on the Wall'']. Accessed February 25, 2006.</ref>

For this work, Roman Vishniac has received the Memorial Award of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] in 1956. He was also the winner of the [[visual arts]] category of awards of the [[Jewish Book Council]] in 1984; ''The Only Flowers of her Youth'' was deemed "most impressive" at the [[Singapore International Salon of Photography|International Photographic Exhibition]] in [[Lucerne]] in 1952; and the Grand Prize for Art in Photography, [[New York Coliseum]].<ref name=roman /><ref name="concern" />

=== Photomicroscopy and biology ===
[[Image:VishniacFirefly.gif|thumb|Vishniac's daughter Mara, through the eye of a [[firefly]]: an achievement in photography and biology]]

In addition to the candid photography for which he is best known, Vishniac worked heavily in the field of [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]], (specifically [[interference microscopy]] and [[cinemicroscopy]]). He specialized in photographing living insects and had a knack for arranging the moving specimens in "just the right poses", according to [[Philippe Halsman]], former president of the [[American Society of Magazine Photographers]]. On the subject of Vishniac's skill in photomicroscopy, Halsman said he was, "a special kind of genius".<ref name=roman /> He worked with all sorts of specimens, from [[protozoa]], to [[firefly|fireflies]] to [[amino acid]]s. Vishniac's work in photomicroscopy is and was highly regarded in the field. For three consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the [[Biological Photographic Association]] in New York.<ref name=roman />

One of Roman Vishniac's most famous endeavors in the field of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary photographs from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind 4,600 tiny [[ommatidia]], complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of [[Boston University]] of the circulating blood inside a [[hamster]]'s cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy.<ref name=columbia /> His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses [[polarized light]] to penetrate certain formations of [[cell structure]] and may greatly improve the detail of an image.<ref name=roman />

In the field of biology, Vishniac specialized in [[marine microbiology]], the [[physiology]] of [[ciliate]]s, [[circulatory system]]s in [[unicellular plant]]s and [[endocrinology]] (from his work in Berlin) and metamorphosis.<ref name=columbia /> Despite his aptitude and accomplishments in the field, most of his work in biology was secondary to his photography: Vishniac studied the [[anatomy]] of an organism primarily to better photograph it. Besides experimenting with the metamorphosis of [[axolotl]], he also researched the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[chromosome]]s in 1920: both in Berlin. As a biologist and philosopher in 1950, he hypothesized [[polyphyletic origin]], a theory that life arose from multiple, independent [[biochemistry|biochemical]] reactions, spawning multicellular life. As a philosopher, he "developed principles of [[rationalistic philosophy]]" in the '50s.<ref name=roman />

=== Other photography ===
Vishniac is notable for his photographs of insects mating, [[sea bass]] feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures for hours in the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie for over an hour in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] equipped with an [[extension tube]]. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.<ref name="roman" />

Vishniac's subjects varied throughout his life. At times, he would focus on documenting everyday life, as in Berlin, and later [[portrait painting|portraiture]], doing famous portraits of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. He was also a pioneer in [[time-lapse|time-lapse photography]], on which he worked from 1915 to 1918,<ref name="roman" /><ref name="wilson" /> and again later in life.

== Religion and philosophy ==
[[Image:VishniacMara.jpg|thumb|right|Vishniac's daughter, Mara, as a young girl, poses in front of a store selling devices for differentiating between [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and Non-Aryan head shapes. Berlin, 1933]]

Roman Vishniac always had strong ties with his ancestry, especially the [[Judaism|Jewish]] aspect of it, "From earliest childhood, my main interest was my ancestors". He was a [[Zionism|Zionist]]<ref name=weiner /><ref name=mitgang /> and a strong sympathizer with Jews who had suffered because of [[anti-Semitism]], "Oh yes, I could be a professor of anti-Semitism", also stating then that he had one hundred and one relatives who died during the Holocaust. A famous photo of his (''pictured right'') of a store in Berlin selling devices for separating Jews and non-Jews by skull shape was used by him to criticize the [[pseudoscience]] of German anti-Semites.<ref name=mitgang />

Vishniac associated much of his work with religion, though not specifically [[Judaism]]. "Nature, [[God]], or whatever you want to call the creator of the Universe comes through the microscope clearly and strongly," he remarked in his laboratory one day.

Living with the memory of hardship, Vishniac was, "an absolute [[optimism|optimist]] filled with tragedy. His [[humanism]] is not just for Jews, but for every living thing."<ref name=schumach /> He probably believed in God or some similar concept, but he was non-denominational and did not adhere strictly to the principles of any religion. He even clashed with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] in one well-known instance: The religious Jews he met on his trek around Europe would not let themselves be photographed, quoting the [[Bible]] and its prohibition of making of [[idolatry|graven images]]. Vishniac's famous response was, "the [[Torah]] existed for thousands of years before the camera had been invented."<ref name=mitgang />

Roman Vishniac was known for having great respect for all living creatures. Whenever possible, he returned a specimen to its precise home before it was captured<ref name=roman /> and one time "[lent] his bathtub to [[tadpole]]s for weeks until he could return them to their pond". In accordance with this philosophy, he photographed almost exclusively living subjects.<ref name=saved>"The saved faces of Roman Vishniac."
