The '''Brazilian monitor ''Alagoas''''' was the third ship of the {{sclass|Par<U+00E1>|monitor|0}} river [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s built for the [[Brazilian Navy]] during the [[War of the Triple Alliance]] in the late 1860s. ''Alagoas'' participated in the [[Passagem de Humait<U+00E1>]] in February 1868 and provided fire support for the army for the rest of the war. The ship was assigned to the Upper Uruguay ({{lang-pt|Alto Uruguai}}) [[Flotilla]] after the war. ''Alagoas'' was transferred to Rio de Janeiro in the 1890s and participated in the [[Revolta da Armada|Fleet Revolt]] of 1893<U+2013>94. The ship was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1900.

==Design and description==
The ''Par<U+00E1>''-class monitors were designed to meet the need of the Brazilian Navy for small, shallow-draft armored ships capable of withstanding heavy fire. The monitor configuration was chosen as a turreted design did not have the same problems engaging enemy ships and fortifications as did the [[casemate ironclad]]s already in Brazilian service. The [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] [[gun turret]] sat on a circular platform that had a central pivot. It was rotated by four men via a system of gears; 2.25 minutes were required for a full 360<U+00B0> rotation. A bronze [[Naval ram|ram]] was fitted to these ships as well. The hull was sheathed with [[Muntz metal]] to reduce [[biofouling]].<ref name=g53>Gratz, p. 153</ref>

The ships measured {{convert|39|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.54|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] between of {{convert|1.51|-|1.54|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|500|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=g54/> With only {{convert|0.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} of [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] they had to be towed between Rio de Janeiro and their area of operations.<ref name=g53/> Their crew numbered 43 officers and men.<ref name=g54>Gratz, p. 154</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''Par<U+00E1>''-class ships had two direct-acting [[marine steam engine|steam engines]], each driving a single {{convert|1.3|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} propeller. Their engines were powered by two tubular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|59|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced a total of {{convert|180|ihp|lk=on}} which gave the monitors a maximum speed of {{convert|8|kn|lk=on}} in calm waters. The ships carried enough coal for one day's steaming.<ref>Gratz, pp. 154<U+2013>56</ref>

===Armament===
''Alagoas'' carried a single [[70-pounder Whitworth naval gun|70-pounder Whitworth]] [[rifled muzzle loader]] (RML) in her [[gun turret]]. The 70-pdr gun had a maximum elevation of 15<U+00B0>. It had a maximum range of {{convert|5540|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref>Gratz, pp. 153<U+2013>54</ref> The 70-pdr gun weighed {{convert|8582|lb|kg|1}} and fired a {{convert|5.5|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} shell that weighed {{convert|81|lb|kg|1}}.<ref>Holley, p. 34</ref> Most unusually the gun's Brazilian-designed iron [[gun carriage|carriage]] was designed to pivot vertically at the [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]; this was done to minimize the size of the [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#G|gunport]] through which splinters and shells could enter.<ref>Gratz, p. 155</ref>

===Armor===
The hull of the ''Par<U+00E1>''-class ships was made from three layers of wood that alternated in orientation. It was {{convert|457|mm|in|sp=us|1}} thick and was capped with a {{convert|102|mm|in|sp=us|0|adj=on}} layer of [[Aspidosperma polyneuron|peroba hardwood]]. The ships had a complete [[wrought iron]] waterline [[Belt armor|belt]], {{convert|0.91|m|ft|sp=us|1}} high. It had a maximum thickness of 102&nbsp;millimeters amidships, decreasing to {{convert|76|mm|in|sp=us|0}} and {{convert|51|mm|in|sp=us|0}} at the ship's ends. The curved [[deck (ship)|deck]] was armored with {{convert|12.7|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron.<ref name=g53/>

The gun turret was shaped like a [[rectangle]] with rounded corners. It was built much like the hull, but the front of the turret was protected by {{convert|152|mm|in|sp=us|0}} of armor, the sides by 102&nbsp;millimeters and the rear by 76&nbsp;millimeters. Its roof and the exposed portions of the platform it rested upon were protected by 12.7&nbsp;millimeters of armor. The armored [[pilothouse]] was positioned ahead of the turret.<ref name=g53/>

==Service==
''Alagoas'' was laid down at the Arsenal de Marinha da C<U+00F4>rte in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 8 December 1866, during the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], which saw [[Argentina]] and Brazil allied against [[Paraguay]]. She was launched on 29 October 1867 and completed in November 1867. She arrived on the [[Paran<U+00E1> River]] in January 1868, although her passage further north was barred by the Paraguayan fortifications at [[Humait<U+00E1>]]. On 19 February 1868, six Brazilian ironclads, including ''Alagoas'', [[Passagem de Humait<U+00E1>|steamed past Humait<U+00E1>]] at night. ''Alagoas'' and her two sister ships, {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Rio Grande||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Par<U+00E1>||2}} were lashed to the larger ironclads in case any engines were disabled by the Paraguayan guns. {{ship|Brazilian ironclad|Barroso||2}} led with ''Rio Grande'', followed by {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Bahia||2}} with ''Alagoas'' and {{ship|Brazilian ironclad|Tamandar<U+00E9>||2}} with ''Par<U+00E1>''.<ref>Gratz, pp. 149<U+2013>50</ref> The cable tying ''Alagoas'' to ''Bahia'' was severed by Paraguayan shells and the monitor drifted down below the guns. The commander of the ''Alagoas'' was ordered not to attempt to pass the guns during daylight, but disregarded this order and successfully rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron upstream of the fortifications.<ref>Scheina, p. 327</ref> Both ''Alagoas'', which had taken an estimated 200 hits, and ''Par<U+00E1>'' had to be beached after passing the fortress to prevent them from sinking. ''Alagoas'' was under repair at [[S<U+00E3>o Jos<U+00E9> do Cerrito]] until mid-March. Accompanied by ''Tamandar<U+00E9>'', ''Alagoas'' bombarded and destroyed the Paraguayan [[artillery battery]] at Timb<U+00F3>, upstream of Humanit<U+00E1>, on 23 March. The monitor bombarded artillery positions defending the [[Tebicuary River]] in July and again in August.
On 15 October she bombarded Angostura Fort, south of Asunci<U+00F3>n, in company with {{ship|Brazilian ironclad|Brasil||2}}, {{ship|Brazilian ironclad|Silvado||2}}, ''Par<U+00E1>'' and her sister {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Cear<U+00E1>||2}}.<ref>Gratz, pp. 149, 157</ref>

After the war ''Alagoas'' was assigned to the newly formed Alto Uruguai Flotilla, based at [[Itaqui]].<ref name=g57/> In the 1880s the ship's armament was reinforced with a pair of {{convert|11|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} machine guns.<ref>Gratz, p. 155</ref> ''Alagoas'' was transferred to Rio de Janeiro in the 1890s and joined the rebels in the [[Revolta da Armada|Fleet Revolt]] of 1893<U+2013>94. Her engines had been removed by this point and she had to be towed into position to fire on the government forts.<ref name=g57/> She was scrapped in 1900.<ref name=g57>Gratz, p. 157</ref>
