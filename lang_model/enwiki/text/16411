'''Alhharth''' is a retired champion [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse and active [[Horse breeding#Terminology|sire]], bred in [[Ireland]], but trained in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Dubai]] during a racing career that lasted from 1995 to 1997. He was named [[European Champion Two-Year-Old Colt|European Champion Two-Year-Old]] at the 1995 [[Cartier Racing Awards]]. In his championship season he won all five of his races including the [[Conditions races|Group One]] [[Dewhurst Stakes]] and three other Group races. He went on to win the [[Prix du Rond Point]] at three and the [[International Stakes (Ireland)]] and [[Prix Dollar]] as a four-year-old. After his retirement he became a successful stallion and is currently standing at the Derrinstown Stud in Ireland.

==Background==
Alhaarth, a bay horse with a white blaze standing 16 [[Hand (unit)|hands]] high,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derrinstown.com/ |title=Derrinstown Stud |publisher=Derrinstown.com |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> was bred in Ireland by his owner [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Hamdan Al Maktoum]]'s Shadwell Stud. He was sired by [[Unfuwain]] out of the mare [[Irish Valley]]. Unfuwain was a high-class middle distance runner who won four [[Conditions races|Group]] races before siring the winners of more than five hundred winners at stud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?popup=1&horse_id=12410 |title=Unfuwain Stud Record |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> Irish Valley, who never raced, was a half-sister to the [[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]] winner and [[Leading sire in France|Champion sire]] [[Green Dancer]] and in addition to Alhaarth, produced the [[Prix du Calvados]] winner, Green Pola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/horse_home_popup.sd?horse_id=99826#topHorseTabs=horse_pedigree&bottomHorseTabs=horse_form |title=Alhaarth pedigree |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>

Alhaarth was originally sent into training with [[Dick Hern]] at [[West Ilsley]]. At the end of his three-year-old season he was transferred to the [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]] team and moved to the stable of [[Saeed bin Suroor]]. He was ridden in ten of his first eleven races by [[Willie Carson]] who retired at the end of the 1996 season: Alhaarth's Dewhurst victory was Carson's last Group One win in Britain. Alhaarth means "the tiller" in Arabic.<ref>http://translate.google.com/#auto|en|%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AB%20</ref>

==Racing career==
===1995: two-year-old season===
Alhaarth made his debut in a [[maiden race]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] in July. He showed his inexperience ("ran green") but took the lead inside the final furlong to win by a neck from the future [[British Classic Races|Classic]] winner  [[Mark of Esteem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=125862&r_date=1995-07-11&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Strutt & Parker Maiden Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> Two weeks later he was moved into [[Conditions races|Group Three]] class for the [[Vintage Stakes]] at [[Glorious Goodwood]]. Alhaarth started odds-on favourite and after tracking the leaders he recovered from being hampered in the straight to win by a [[Horse length|length]] from Allied Forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=126304&r_date=1995-07-26&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Vintage Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>

In the [[Solario Stakes]] at [[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown]] in August Alhaarth started at 30/100 and won comfortably, beating Staffin by three lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=126953&r_date=1995-08-18&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Solario Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'s'' correspondent praised his balance, "authority" and "exceptional stride", whilst bookmakers offered him at 16/1 for the [[2000 Guineas]] and 8/1 for the [[Epsom Derby|Derby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/alhaarth-in-classic-control-1596953.html |title=Alhaarth in Classic control - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-08-19 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> Only two colts took on Alhaarth in the [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]]. He won again, beating Rio Duvida at odds of 2/5,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=127421&r_date=1995-09-08&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Champagne Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> but the lack of pace and weak opposition meant that the race proved little.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/alhaarth-works-hard-for-champagne-1600246.html |title=Alhaarth works hard for Champagne - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-09-09 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>

On his final start of the season, Alhaarth was sent to Newmarket for Britain's most prestigious two-year-old race, the [[Conditions races|Group One]] [[Dewhurst Stakes]]. Only three colts opposed Alhaarth, but they included the [[Prix Morny]] winner [[Tagula (horse)|Tagula]], and the unbeaten [[Danehill Dancer]], winner of the [[Phoenix Stakes]] and the [[National Stakes]]. Alhaarth tracked the [[pacemaker (running)|pacemaker]] Albaha, before moving into the lead three furlongs out. He soon went clear and recorded an "impressive" win, beating Danehill Dancer by two and a half lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=128063&r_date=1995-10-13&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Dewhurst Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> Hern called the "demolition" of Danehill Dancer as a "great performance" and described Alhaarth as the best two-year-old he had trained while the senior handicapper Geoffrey Gibbs called the win "very authoritative" and suggested that Alhaarth was on the way to becoming a great horse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/hern-warmed-by-alhaarth-1577604.html |title=Hern warmed by Alhaarth - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> His price for the Guineas was as cut to as low as 2/1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/alhaarth-all-the-rage-for-the-guineas-1577629.html |title=Alhaarth all the rage for the Guineas - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>

===1996: three-year-old season===
Alhaarth began 1996 as the short-priced favourite for both the 2000 Guineas and the Derby although Hern was reported to be concerned by the colt's lack of physical growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/alhaarth-to-prove-no-small-wonder-1305537.html |title=Alhaarth to prove no small wonder - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-04-18 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> Alhaarth lost his unbeaten record on his three-year-old debut. He started 1/2 favourite for the [[Craven Stakes]] over a mile at Newmarket, but after taking the lead, he was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Beauchamp King. Hern spoke positively after the race, saying "that will have done him good" but reportedly looked as despondent as "a man who had just had his tomatoes visited by blight".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/classic-favourite-alhaarth-falters-1305733.html |title=Classic favourite Alhaarth falters - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-04-19 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> Despite the defeat, Alhaarth started 2/1 favourite for the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance just over two weeks later after performing impressively in an exercise gallop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Reid+'em+and+weep.-a061160462 |title=Reid 'em and weep. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> He was held up in the early stages, but when asked to challenge he was unable to reach the leaders, and finished fourth, six lengths behind Mark of Esteem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=200528&r_date=1996-05-04&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=2000 Guineas result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>

Alhaarth was moved up to middle distances for his next two starts. In the [[Epsom Derby]] he put up a fair effort to finish fifth behind [[Shaamit]] after meeting interference in running,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=200532&r_date=1996-06-08&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Epsom Derby result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> but in the [[Irish Derby]] he was disappointing, coming home a remote ninth of the thirteen runners behind [[Zagreb (horse)|Zagreb]]. 

A return to one mile saw him take third places in the [[Sussex Stakes]] and the [[Celebration Mile]] before he was sent to France for the [[Prix du Rond-Point]] at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] on [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe|Arc]] day in October. Ridden by [[Richard Hills]], Alhaarth led from the start and stayed on strongly to record his first victory in almost a year, beating the 1995 winner of the race [[Shaanxi]] by one and a half lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=231448&r_date=1996-10-06&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Prix du Rond-Point result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> The victory was greeted enthusiastically by the British contingent and Hern said that the performance gave him "great pleasure, because I know what a good horse he is."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/alhaarth-warms-british-party-1356012.html |title=Alhaarth warms British party - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-10-07 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>

===1997: four-year-old season=== 
Alhaarth joined the Godolphin stable and spent the winter of 1996-7 in [[Dubai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thoroughbredinternet.com/newsmore.html?Id=17224 |title=thoroughbredinternet/newsmore |publisher=Thoroughbredinternet.com |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> He did not run however, until [[Royal Ascot]], where he ran second to [[Bosra Sham]] in the [[Prince of Wales's Stakes]]. Twelve days later he traveled to Ireland to win the Group Two [[International Stakes (Ireland)|Budweiser American Bowl International Stakes]], taking the lead a furlong out and running on well to beat [[Gothenberg (horse)|Gothenberg]] by a length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=240672&r_date=1997-06-29&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=International Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>

His next two starts were disappointing: he finished last of the nine runners in the Celebration Mile in August and a remote third, beaten more than 18 lengths behind [[Pilsudski (horse)|Pilsudski]] in the [[Irish Champion Stakes]].

On his final start, Alhaarth returned to Longchamp in October and produced his best performance of the season in the Group Two [[Prix Dollar]]. He led from the start and was always "in command", winning by a length from Lord Cromby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=244299&r_date=1997-10-04&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Prix Dollar result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>

==Assessmment==
Alhaarth was rated the best two-year-old to run in Europe during 1995, being awarded a rating of 126 in the International Classification, two pounds ahead of the [[Middle Park Stakes]] winner [[Royal Applause]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/handicappers-swing-from-yesterdays-hero-1322516.html |title=Handicappers swing from yesterday's hero - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=1996-01-05 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>

He was also named [[Cartier Racing Awards#Two-Year-Old Colt|European Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] at the [[Cartier Racing Awards]] for 1995.

==Stud career==
Since his retirement, Alhaarth has stood at Hamdan Al Maktoum's Irish base at the Derrinstown Stud, [[County Kildare]]. He has sired the winners of more than 500 races, including [[Haafhd]] ([[2000 Guineas]], [[Champion Stakes]]), Bandari (six Group races) and Phoenix Reach ([[Dubai Sheema Classic]], [[Hong Kong Vase]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=99826&popup=1&tab=stud |title=Alhaarth &#124; Stud Record &#124; Bloodstock Stallion Book &#124; Racing Post |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> He currently stands at a fee of <U+20AC>5,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derrinstown.com/ |title=Derrinstown Stud |publisher=Derrinstown.com |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref>
