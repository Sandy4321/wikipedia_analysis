'''Harry Julius Shearer''' (born December 23, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer, [[Voice acting|voice artist]], musician, author and radio host. He is known for his long-running role on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', his work on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the comedy band [[Spinal Tap]] and his radio program ''[[Le Show]]''. Born in [[Los Angeles, California]], Shearer began his career as a [[child actor]], appearing in ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', as well as the 1953 films ''[[Abbott and Costello Go to Mars]]'' and ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the [[Eddie Haskell]] character in the pilot episode for the television series ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', but his parents decided not to let him continue in the role so that he could have a normal childhood. 

From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group. Following the break up of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film ''[[Real Life (film)|Real Life]]'' with [[Albert Brooks]] and started writing for [[Martin Mull]]'s television series ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]''. In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on ''Saturday Night Live''. Shearer describes his experience on the show as a "living hell" and he did not get along well with the other writers and cast members. He left the show in 1980. Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', a [[satire|satirical]] [[rockumentary]] about a band called Spinal Tap. Shearer portrayed [[Derek Smalls]], the bassist, and [[Michael McKean]] and [[Christopher Guest]] played the other two members. The film became a cult hit and the band has since released several albums and played several concerts. While promoting the film, Shearer was offered the chance to return to ''Saturday Night Live''. He accepted, but left the show for good in January 1985. Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program ''[[Le Show]]'' on [[Santa Monica|Santa Monica's]] [[National Public Radio|NPR]]-affiliated radio station, [[KCRW]]. The program, a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and [[sketch comedy]], is carried on many [[public radio]] stations throughout the United States.

In 1989, Shearer became a part of the cast of ''The Simpsons''. He provides voices for numerous characters, including [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]], [[Lenny Leonard]], [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], [[Otto Mann]] and [[Rainier Wolfcastle]]. Shearer has been vocal about what he perceives as the show's declining quality. In 2004, he said "I rate the last three seasons as among the worst."<ref name="legget"/>  

Shearer also directed the 2002 film ''[[Teddy Bears' Picnic (film)|Teddy Bears' Picnic]]'' and appeared in several films, including ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]'' and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''. Shearer has written three books, ''Man Bites Town'', ''It's the Stupidity, Stupid'', and ''Not Enough Indians''. He has been married to singer-songwriter [[Judith Owen]] since 1993. He has received several [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and [[Grammy Award]] nominations and in 2008 it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in the radio category.

===Early career===
[[Image:Mel Blanc (1976).jpg|thumb|[[Mel Blanc]] took Shearer "under his wing" during his early days in show-business.]]
Shearer was born December 23, 1943 in Los Angeles, California, the son of Dora Warren ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Kohn), a book-keeper, and Mack Shearer.<ref name="thejc"/> His parents were [[Jew]]ish immigrants from Austria and Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8329 |title=Shearer Enjoyment|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|accessdate=2009-04-30|date=2002-03-28|author=Pfefferman, Naomi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/31034/edition_id/581/format/html/displaystory.html |title=j. - <U+2018>Hi-diddly-ho, Marin!<U+2019> Man of many voices Harry Shearer comes to JCC|work=Jewish Weekly|accessdate=2009-04-30|date=2006-12-01|author=Eskenazi, Joe}}</ref> Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a children's agent, as she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. Shearer received the role when he was seven-years-old.<ref name="ign1">{{cite web|title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 1 of 4)|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035860p1.html|author=Plume, Kenneth|publisher=IGN|date=2000-02-10|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> He described [[Jack Benny]] as "very warm and approachable [...] He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy."<ref name="avclub"/> Shearer said in an interview that one person who "took him under his wing" and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor [[Mel Blanc]], who voiced many animated characters, including [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=5&entry_id=11888|title=Chronicle Podcasts : New Orleans economy stillborn, says Harry Shearer|date=2007-08-25|accessdate=2009-04-30|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref> Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film ''[[Abbott and Costello Go to Mars]]'', in which he only had a small part.

After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could get a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.<ref name="avclub"/>

Shearer attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] as a political science major in the early 1960s and decided to quit show business to become a "serious person".<ref name="ign1"/> However, he says this lasted "about a month," and he joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', UCLA's school newspaper, during his freshman year.<ref name="ign1"/> According to Shearer, after graduating, he had "a very serious agenda going on, and it was 'Stay Out Of The Draft.'"<ref name="ign1"/> He attended [[graduate school]] at [[Harvard University]] for one year and worked at the state legislature in [[Sacramento]]. In 1967 and 1968 he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following "disagreements with the administration."<ref name="ign1"/>

From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group that included [[David Lander]], [[Richard Beebe]] and [[Michael McKean]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifrxq95ldhe~T1 |title=The Credibility Gap |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=Deming, Mark|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The group consisted of "a bunch of newsmen" at [[KRLA 1110]], "the number two station" in Los Angeles.<ref name="avclub"/> They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. By the time he got home, there was a message on his answering machine asking, "Can you come to work tomorrow?"<ref name="avclub"/> The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by [[KPPC-FM]], so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues.<ref name="ign1"/> While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] for the [[Pop Chronicles]] music documentary.<ref name="Gilliland">{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/e-l |title=Index to Interviews |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=2008-01-02 |authorlink=John Gilliland |last=Gilliland |first=John}}</ref> The group broke up 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''.<ref name="ign1"/>  Shearer started working with [[Albert Brooks]], producing one of Brooks' albums and co-writing the film ''[[Real Life (film)|Real Life]]''.

The show, which starred [[Christopher Guest]], [[Tom Leopold]] and Michael McKean, was not picked up.<ref name="ign1"/>

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', one of the first additions to the cast,<ref name="avclub"/> and an unofficial replacement for [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]], who were both leaving the show.<ref name="ign2">{{cite web|title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 2 of 4)|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035861p1.html|author=Plume, Kenneth|publisher=IGN|date=2000-02-10|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> [[Al Franken]] recommended Shearer to ''Saturday Night Live'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002|p=170}}</ref> Shearer describes his experience on the show as a "living hell" and "not a real pleasant place to work."<ref name="ign2"/> He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage, and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer.<ref>{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002|p=171}}</ref> His first tenure on the show ended when Michaels left ''Saturday Night Live'', taking the entire cast with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002|p=176}}</ref>

In 1984, while promoting the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had a performance on ''Saturday Night Live''. All three members were offered the chance to join to the show in the 1984<U+2013>1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved<ref name="ign2"/> but later stated that he "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars."<ref>{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002|p=261}}</ref> Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it. [[Dick Ebersol]], who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was "a gifted performer but a pain in the butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person."<ref>{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002|p=260}}</ref> In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good.<ref name="ign2"/> [[Martin Short]] said "[Shearer] wanted to be creative and Dick [Ebersol] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset."<ref>{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002|p=288}}</ref>

===Spinal Tap===
[[Image:Derek Smalls.jpg|thumb|Harry Shearer as [[Derek Smalls]] in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.]] 
Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.<ref name="avclub"/> Shearer, Reiner, [[Michael McKean]] and [[Christopher Guest]] received a deal to write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20 minute demo of what they wanted to do.<ref name="ign2"/> It was eventually greenlit by [[Norman Lear]] and [[Jerry Perenchio]] at [[Embassy Pictures]].<ref name="ign2"/> The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of [[hard-rock]] and [[heavy-metal]] bands, as well as the [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tendencies of [[rockumentary|rockumentaries]] of the time. The three core members of the band [[Spinal Tap]]<U+2014>[[David St. Hubbins]], [[Derek Smalls]] and [[Nigel Tufnel]]<U+2014>were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed.<ref name="ign2"/> It was filmed in 25 days.<ref name="ign2"/>

Shearer said in an interview that "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right."<ref name="thejc"/> When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public.<ref name="avclub"/> The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a [[cult following]], after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|date=2000-06-14|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> and it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html|title=Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989-2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref>

Shearer, Guest and McKean have since worked on several projects as their Spinal Tap characters. The band has released two albums: ''[[This Is Spinal Tap (album)|This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) and ''[[Break Like the Wind]]'' (1992).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/spinaltap/discography|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2009-05-01|title=Spinal Tap: Discography}}</ref> In 1992, Spinal Tap appeared in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' called "[[The Otto Show]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page22.shtml|title=The Otto Show|accessdate=2009-05-01|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the band would release a new album, ''Back From The Dead'', to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of the film<ref>{{cite web|title=Spinal Tap to return with new album|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/04/spinal-tap-record-new-album|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2009-02-04|author=Michaels, Sean|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> and the band announced a one date "world tour" performing at London's [[Wembley Arena]] on June 30, 2009.<ref name="bbcworldtour">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7985487.stm|title=Spinal Tap announce 'world tour'|date=2009-04-06|publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> The band has played several concerts, including at [[Live Earth]] in London on July 7, 2007.

===''The Simpsons''===
Shearer may be best known for his prolific work as a voice actor on ''The Simpsons''. [[Matt Groening]], the creator of the show, was a fan of Shearer's work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write.<ref name="ign3">{{cite web|title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 3 of 4)|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035862p1.html|author=Plume, Kenneth|publisher=IGN|date=2000-02-10|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Shearer was asked if he wanted to be in the series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought it would be too much trouble.<ref name="ign3"/> After three calls, executive producer [[James L.

Shearer, who thought it was a "pretty cool" way to work, found it peculiar that the members of the cast were adamant about not being known to the public as the people behind the voices.<ref name="avclub"/>

Shearer provides voices for [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Julius Hibbert]], [[Lenny Leonard]], [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], [[Otto Mann]], [[Rainier Wolfcastle]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Dr. Marvin Monroe|Dr. Marvin Monroe]] and many others.<ref>[[#Richmond|Richmond]], pp. 178<U+2013>179</ref> He describes all of his regular characters' voices as "easy to slip into.

In 2004, Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: "I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so [[The Simpsons (season 4)|Season Four]] looks very good to me now."<ref name="legget">{{cite news |first=Chris|last=Leggett|title=Harry Shearer|publisher=UK Teletext|date=[[2004-08-04]]}}</ref> Shearer has also been vocal about "[[The Principal and the Pauper]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997) one of the most controversial episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Seymour Skinner]], a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "That's so wrong.

It was a profoundly disturbing act of self-discipline."<ref name="thejc"/>
