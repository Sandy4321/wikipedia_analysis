Faber also invests and acts as a fund manager to private wealthy clients. Faber is a regular speaker on the investment circuit, often quoted in the financial press for his non-conformist viewpoint and alternative investment philosophies. His current tag-line is: 'buy a $100 US bond and frame it to teach your children about inflation by watching the US bond value diminish to almost nothing over the next 20 years'{{fact|date=May 2011}}

|accessdate=2009-12-15}}</ref> However Faber said that this prediction was "accidental".

He lost money shorting US stocks in 1999 although his call was later vindicated. He admits that [[market timing]] is very difficult. Nevertheless, his market advice since 2000 is quite accurate. Faber predicted the rise of oil, [[precious metals]], other commodities, [[emerging markets]], and especially China in his book ''Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery''.  He also correctly predicted the slide of the U.S. dollar since 2002<ref name=tribute1>{{cite web

(Fox News, 2-2007); however, by 5/2007 he was saying that U.S. equities were moderately overvalued <U+2014> less so than those of emerging markets.

In a June 2008 interview with [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]], he goes over his bearish views on a wide spectrum of investments: stocks, real estate and commodities. He is extremely critical of the Fed's inflationary actions.  However, his views for the short-run were almost entirely deflationary except for holding precious metals; Faber still views hyperinflation as a certainty within the next 10 years. He also correctly expressed temporary bullishness for the U.S. dollar in the middle of 2008 before it dramatically recovered and positive expectations for holding the Japanese yen.<ref>Faber, Marc.

Faber has been long term [[Bear market|bearish]] about the American economy for a number of years and continues to be so.  He concluded his June 2008 newsletter with the following mock quote: 

<blockquote>
"The federal government is sending each of us a [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008|$600 rebate]]. If we spend that money at [[Wal-Mart]], the money goes to [[China]]. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to [[India]]. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to [[Mexico]], [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]]. If we purchase a good car it will go to [[Germany]]. If we purchase useless crap it will go to [[Taiwan]] and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part."<ref>Gosnell, Peter. (2008-10-17). [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24506965-5014114,00.html "Prostitutes and beer in US"]. ''The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)''. Retrieved 2009-12-15.</ref>
