'''''Playing with Fire''''' is the best selling [[autobiography]] of former [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) player [[Theoren Fleury]].  Co-written with author [[Kirstie McLellan Day]], Fleury documented how he became a star player, [[Stanley Cup]] champion and [[Olympic]] gold medalist despite battling drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately ended his NHL career and led him to contemplate suicide. In the book, he made allegations that he was sexually abused by his [[junior ice hockey|junior]] coach, [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]], and subsequently filed a complaint with [[Winnipeg Police Service]]. ''Playing with Fire'' has been named to the short-list of nominees by the [[Canadian Booksellers Association]]'s  for the [[Libris Awards|Libris Award]] for top non-fiction book of 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbabook.org/files/LibrisAwards/CBALibrisShortlistAnnouncement10.pdf |title=CBA Libris Awards 2010 Shortlist |publisher=Canadian Booksellers Association |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref>

In the weeks prior to the book's October 16, 2009 release, Fleury attempted to return to the NHL with the team he first played for, the [[Calgary Flames]], six years after his last NHL game.
