'''Laurino''' is a town and [[comune]] in the [[province of Salerno]] in the [[Campania]] region of south-western [[Italy]].

==Geography==
'''Laurino''' is a typical medieval hill town of the [[Cilento]], the southernmost part of Campania. It dominates the surrounding landscape, overlooking the [[Calore lucano]] river, which is crossed by two medieval bridges; Laurino was once known as the "pearl of the Calore". The river flows through the Cilento national park from its source up on [[Monte Cervati]]; it is known for the wildlife it attracts, such as [[European otter]]s. There are many laurel trees in the area, which probably gave their name to the village via the Latin ''Laurus'' or ''Laurinus''.

==History==
The settlement goes back to pre-Christian times. In the 12th century the total population excedeed 20,000, spread between the main town and five surrounding villages. However Laurino was destroyed by the troops of [[Frederick III of Sicily]] during the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] (1282-1302). 

Due to migration in recent decades toward the north in search for employment, the current population is just under 2000.

==Sights==
There are many reminders of past glories in Laurino, from the ruins of the ducal palace to the frescos and wooden carvings of the main church, Santa Maria Maggiore.  Today the place is known for its natural environment, and initiatives such as the '''Jazz in Laurino''' festival in August.
