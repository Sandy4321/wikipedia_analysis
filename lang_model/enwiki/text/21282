===Casting===
''Kung Fu Hustle'' pays tribute to many famous veterans of Hong Kong action cinema of the 1970s. [[Yuen Wah]], a member of the [[Seven Little Fortunes]] plays the Landlord of the Pig Sty Alley. He has appeared in hundreds of Hong Kong films from the 1970s and was a [[stunt double]] of [[Bruce Lee]]. Yuen Wah considered the film to be the peak of his career. He remarked that despite the comedic nature of the film, the shooting process was a serious matter. With a tight schedule, there was no time for laughs. In spite of the film's success, Yuen Wah worried that nowadays fewer people practice martial arts.<ref>{{cite news

[[Image:Kung_Fu_Hustle_Beast.jpg|thumb|Bruce Leung's appearance in ''Kung Fu Hustle'' marks his return to the film industry after a 15-year hiatus.]]
The part of the Landlady was offered to [[Yuen Qiu]], another student of [[Yu Jim Yuen]], ''[[sifu]]'' of the Seven Little Fortunes. Yuen Qiu was a "[[Bond girl]]" in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' at the age of 18. Having retired from the film industry after her marriage in the 1980s, ''Kung Fu Hustle'' was her comeback. She admitted that she never expected to star in the film. When her colleague was on stage during a tryout for ''Kung Fu Hustle'', she stood near her and smoked a [[cigarette]] with a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] expression on her face. That pose earned her the part. To fulfil Stephen Chow's image of a "fat lady", Yuen Qiu deliberately gained weight before production by eating [[snack food|midnight snacks]] on a daily basis.<ref>{{cite web

[[Bruce Leung Siu-lung|Leung Siu Lung]], who plays the Beast is Stephen Chow's childhood martial arts hero.<ref name=inter/> Leung Siu Lung was a famous action film director and actor in the 1970s and 1980s, known as the "Third Dragon" after Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan.

1930s [[Shanghai]] is in turmoil. Various gangs vie for power, the most feared of which is the [[Axe]] Gang, aptly named after their preferred weapons. With the police powerless to stem the crime wave, people can only live in peace in poor areas which hold no interest for the gangs. An example is Pig Sty Alley, a [[apartment|tenement]] home to people in various trades, run by a promiscuous landlord and his domineering wife. One day, two troublemakers, Sing and Bone enter, drawing attention from the Axe Gang which storms the alley. Thanks to the [[martial arts]] mastery of three tenants (the Coolie, Tailor and Donut the baker), the gangsters are repulsed. 

Back in the streets, Sing reveals his past. As a child, he spent his life savings to buy a "[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Palm" manual from a beggar with the intention of "preserving world peace". The young Sing practiced his skills, but was badly beaten up when he tried to save a mute girl from bullies who wanted to snatch her [[lollipop]]. Sing hence swore to become a bad person. Sing and Bone steal [[ice cream]] from a mute female vendor, who is startled to see Sing, escaping on a [[tram]] before she could stop them.

[[Image:Coolie.jpg|thumb|The Coolie fends off the Axe Gang with his Twelve Kicks from the Tam School.|200px|right]]
Having witnessed the power of the three martial artists, Brother Sum hires the Harpists, the second best killers to assassinate them. The Harpists strike at night as the Coolie, Tailor and Donut are getting ready to depart, having been evicted earlier that day for offending the mafia. Eventually, the Landlord and his wife are forced to intervene with their [[Tai Chi Chuan]] and [[Lion's Roar]]. Despite their efforts, the three martial artists die from their wounds.

The following day, Sing mugs the mute ice cream vendor, who is revealed to be the girl Sing saved in his childhood. He is admitted to the Axe Gang, and Brother Sum, having earlier witnessed Sing's ability to quickly pick locks, gives Sing the task of sneaking into a mental asylum to free the Beast, the Ultimate King of Killers (<U+7D42><U+6975><U+6BBA><U+4EBA><U+738B>). 

Brother Sum is initially sceptical of the Beast, but is convinced when the Beast demonstrates his ability to stop bullets. The Beast finds the Landlord and his wife in a casino. Using a giant funeral bell as a megaphone to amplify the Landlady's Lion's Roar, the couple nearly defeats the Beast, but they are outsmarted by his desperation move, resulting in a stalemate. Brother Sum instructs Sing to smash the Landlady's head with a table leg, but Sing hits the Beast and is badly beaten for his treachery. Fortunately, he is carried off by the Landlord and his wife while the Beast's back is turned. In a fit of rage, the Beast kills Brother Sum when rebuked.

[[Image:Stephen Chow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sing fights the Axe Gang.]]
Back in the Alley, Sing quickly recovers, transforming into a kung fu master and engages the Axe Gang and the Beast. Sing dispatches the gangsters with ease but is sent flying by the Beast<U+2019>s Toad leap skill. Up in the sky, Sing realises his Buddhist Palm. He dives downwards with his body ablaze, holding out his palm, and slams into the Beast, creating a big palm shaped crater in the ground. Sing stops the Beast's desperation move by another Palm, creating another big palm shaped hole in the building behind him. The Beast, completely shocked, bows down to Sing, conceding defeat.

Some time later, Sing and Bone open a sweet shop that specialises in lollipops. When the mute ice cream vendor walks by, Sing goes out to meet her. The two revert to their childhood forms, running happily into the shop. Outside the shop, the same beggar who sold Sing the Buddhist Palm manual offers a selection of martial arts manuals to a boy eating a lollipop.

==Parodies and references==

''Kung Fu Hustle'' makes references to a wide range of films, [[animation|animated]] cartoons and other sources, drawing on ideas from ''[[wuxia]]'' novels. The housing arrangement of the Pig Sty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, ''[[The House of 72 Tenants]]'' (<U+4E03><U+5341><U+4E8C><U+5BB6><U+623F><U+5BA2>). During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, "Even if you kill me, there will be thousands more of me!". This is a parody of a saying by [[Lu Hao-tung]], a Chinese revolutionary in the late [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name="Ru Lai Shen Zhang">{{cite web

[[Image:Kung fu hustle matrix parody.jpg|thumb|An aerial shot of Sing fighting the Axe Gang. The fight is reminiscent of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.|225px|right]]
A major element of the plot is based on the 1982 martial arts film ''Ru Lai Shen Zhang'' (<U+5982><U+4F86><U+795E><U+638C>). Sing studied the same Buddhist Palm Kung Fu style from a young age and realised it at the end of the film. In reality, it does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Chinese name of the Beast, the Evil God of the Fiery Cloud (<U+706B><U+96F2><U+90AA><U+795E>) and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the film, where a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it.<ref>{{cite web
