'''Louis Joseph "Lou" Sebille''' (November 21, 1915&nbsp;<U+2013> August 5, 1950) was a [[fighter pilot]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] during [[World War II]] and later the [[United States Air Force]] during the [[Korean War]]. He rose to the rank of [[Major (rank)|Major]] and [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions on August 5, 1950 in [[South Korea]] during the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]].

Born in [[Michigan]], Sebille worked as an [[MC]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] before joining the [[US Army Air Corps]] shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. Sebille flew [[B-26 Marauder]] bombers over [[Europe]] from 1943 to 1945 and was highly decorated for his 68 combat missions. Sebille eventually accrued more than 3,000 hours of flying time. He briefly became an airline pilot before returning to the Air Force before the start of the Korean War.

Sebille commanded the [[67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron]] at the outbreak of the Korean War, flying [[F-51 Mustang]]s in [[close air support]] and [[air strike]] missions. During one such mission, Sebille attacked a [[North Korean]] armored column advancing on [[United Nations]] units. Though his aircraft was heavily damaged and he was wounded during the first pass on the column, he turned his plane around and attacked again, [[suicide attack|deliberately crashing into the convoy]] at the cost of his life. After his death, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

== Biography ==
Louis J. Sebille was born on November 12, 1915 in [[Harbor Beach, Michigan]].<ref name="AFBio">{{Citation|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/person.asp?dec=1950&pid=123225864 |title=Biography: Louis J.

He was described as "a handsome glib master of ceremonies who used to wow the customers with his own parody of [[My Blue Heaven (song)|My Blue Heaven]]".<ref name="Time1">{{Citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856664,00.html#ixzz186gColYr |title=War: If you have to die... |date=September 4, 1950 |publisher=''[[Time Magazine]]'' |accessdate=2010-12-14}}</ref> Sebille married and his wife gave birth to a son in December of 1949.<ref name="Time2">{{Citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821605,00.html |title=National Affairs No. 31 |date=September 3, 1951 |publisher=''[[Time Magazine]]'' |accessdate=2010-12-14}}</ref>

=== World War II ===
Sebille enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] several days after the December 7, 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Empire of Japan]]. He began [[flight training]] in January 1942, in spite of being two months older than the cutoff age of 26. During that time he was described as an outstanding pilot and leader, and his maturity was helpful for the younger flight trainees.<ref name="AFBio"/> After completing flight training, Sebille was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[Second Lieutenant]] and assigned to the [[450th Bombardment Squadron]], [[3rd Bombardment Wing]] at [[MacDill Field]], [[Florida]]. Sebille flew [[B-26 Marauder]] aircraft.<ref name="AFBio"/>

Deployed to [[England]] in 1943, Sebille flew bombing missions in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]]. Originally, the squadron flew low-altitude bombing missions against [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] targets, but when those flights began producing heavy casualties for Air Force aircrews, they began flying medium-altitude missions.<ref name="AFBio"/> Sebille advanced to [[Flight (military unit)|flight leader]] and then was promoted to squadron [[operations officer]] with a [[temporary rank]] of [[Major]]. By the end of the war, Sebille had flown 68 combat missions before returning to the [[United States]] in March, 1945.<ref name="AFBio"/>

After the end of the war, Sebille left the Air Force and began work as a commercial [[airline pilot]].<ref name="Time1"/> However he returned to the Air Force in July 1946 when offered a commission as a [[First Lieutenant]]. He held several positions, first working as an [[F-51 Mustang]] and [[F-80 Shooting Star]] instructor pilot, then attended [[Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics|Air Tactical School]] at [[Tyndall Field]], [[Florida]].<ref name="AFBio"/> He was assigned to [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Philippines]] in 1948. During this time, he flew an F-51D named ''Nancy III'' (tail number 44-74112).<ref name="Dorr25">{{harvnb|Dorr|2003|p=25}}</ref> In November of 1948, Sebille was once again promoted to Major and made the [[commanding officer]] of the [[67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron]], [[18th Fighter-Bomber Wing]], a component of the [[Fifth United States Air Force]] stationed in [[Japan]] for post-World War II [[Occupation of Japan|occupation duties]].<ref name="AFBio"/> In November 1949, the squadron began receiving new F-80's but continued to fly a mix of F-80 and F-51 aircraft.<ref name="Bite49">{{harvnb|Biteman|1998|p=49}}</ref> During this time, Sebille was known to spend time in his squadron's [[Quonset hut]]. He frequently discussed fighting and death, including sentiments supporting [[suicide attack]], at one point saying "If you have to die, then take some of the enemy with you."<ref name="Time1"/>

=== Korean War ===
[[File:Louis Sebille in Korea.jpg|thumb|Louis Sebille in Korea.|alt=A man in a flight suit standing next to an aircraft.]]
With the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] on June 25, 1950, the [[United Nations]] voted to send troops into [[South Korea]] to aid it against the [[North Korean]] [[North Korean Army|Army]] to prevent the country from collapsing. Sebille's unit was among those send to assist the UN ground forces operating in Korea.<ref name="Apple264">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=264}}</ref> By the end of July, the US had shipped a large number of aircraft of all types to Korea. On July 30, the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]]s had 890 planes; 626 F-80's and 264 F-51's, but only 525 of them were in units and available and ready for combat.<ref name="Apple257">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=257}}</ref>

Early in the war, these aircraft were used primarily to conduct raids and gather intelligence on North Korean ground targets, focused on disrupting North Korean supply to the front lines.<ref name="Bruning28">{{harvnb|Bruning|1999|p=28}}</ref> However, as soon as UN forces retreated to Pusan Perimeter following the [[Battle of Taejon]], the Naval aircraft were immediately re purposed for [[close-air support]] and [[airstrikes]] against North Korean ground troops on the front.<ref name="Bruning31">{{harvnb|Bruning|1999|p=31}}</ref> These missions were significantly more risky and the aircraft suffered much higher losses due to North Korean ground fire.<ref name="Ecker6">{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=6}}</ref><ref name="Bruning37">{{harvnb|Bruning|1999|p=37}}</ref> On August 1, Sebille and his squadron moved to [[Ashiya Air Field]] and began conducting missions in support of the ground forces in Korea.<ref name="Bite50">{{harvnb|Biteman|1998|p=50}}</ref> By August 5, Sebille had accrued over 3,000 hours of flying time over the course of his career.<ref name="AFBio"/> During this time, the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron operated primarily out of [[Ashiya, Fukuoka|Ashiya]] but also used airfields at [[Taegu]] and [[Pusan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dorr|2003|p=44}}</ref>

=== Medal of Honor action ===
{{seealso|Battle of Pusan Perimeter}}
At the beginning of the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]], the night of September 4, North Korean troops established a [[beachhead]] across the [[Naktong River]] and were using it to advance across the river and [[Battle of Taegu|attack Taegu]], where the UN's [[Eighth United States Army]] was headquartered in defense of the perimeter. A [[T-6 Mosquito]] [[forward air controller]] spotted a North Korea column advancing through the village of [[Hamchang]] the next morning, September 5. Sebille was ordered to lead a flight of three F-51's on an airstrike against the North Korean troops advancing there.<ref name="AFBio"/>

Sebille flew a P-51 (tail number 44-74394) loaded with two {{convert|500|lb}} bombs, six rockets, and six [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 Browning .50 caliber machine guns]].<ref name="Dorr25"/> He and his [[wingmen]] approached the village at an altitude of {{convert|5,000|ft}} and spotted a North Korean armored column crossing the river in a shallow area. Sebille positioned himself for a medium-angle [[dive bomb]] run, planning to drop both of his bombs on his first attack. Diving, he held steady until about {{convert|2,500|ft}}. When he spotted a target column of trucks, artillery guns and [[armored car (military)|armored car]]s, led by a North Korean [[Armored Personnel Carrier]], he hit the bomb release button on his control stick, and then made a sharp pull-up to the left to stay away from his bomb blast. However, only one of his bombs had released, and the {{convert|500|lb}} of unbalanced weight under his left wing may have contributed to his near miss on the first run.<ref name="AFBio"/>

North Korean [[anti aircraft]] fire struck Sebille's F-51 as he turned to make a second run, heavily damaging the aircraft and it began trailing smoke and [[coolant]].<ref name="Time2"/> Sebille had intended to release his second bomb, but he radioed one of his wingmen that he had been hit and injured, probably fatally. His wingman radioed back Sebille should try to head for a US emergency landing strip in Taegu a short distance away, but Sebille responded with his last known words, "No, I'll never make it. I'm going back and get that bastard (''[[sic]]'')".<ref name="Time1"/> He dove straight toward the APC that was his target. He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular {{convert|2,000|ft}}, he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns. His plane sustained even heavier damage, and he crashed into the North Korean convoy destroying a large contingent of North Korean ground troops and vehicles though being killed instantly himself.<ref name="Dorr25"/>

He was buried at [[Forest Home Cemetery, Chicago|Forest Home Cemetery]] in [[Forest Park, Illinois|Forest Park]], Chicago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page=city&FScityid=41672|title=Browse by City: Forest Park|accessdate=2008-05-05 |work=[[Find A Grave]]}}</ref> After his death, a short obituary for Sebille appeared in ''[[Time Magazine]]''.<ref name="Time1"/> The [[United States Air Force Academy]] also created a memorial to Sebille in [[United States Air Force Academy, Cadet Area|Harmon Hall]], the academy's administration building.<ref name="AFBio"/>

Maj. Sebille, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. During an attack on a camouflaged area containing a concentration of enemy troops, artillery, and armored vehicles, Maj. Sebille's F-51 aircraft was severely damaged by antiaircraft fire. Although fully cognizant of the short period he could remain airborne, he deliberately ignored the possibility of survival by abandoning the aircraft or by crash landing, and continued his attack against the enemy forces threatening the security of friendly ground troops. In his determination to inflict maximum damage upon the enemy, Maj. Sebille again exposed himself to the intense fire of enemy gun batteries and dived on the target to his death. The superior leadership, daring, and selfless devotion to duty which he displayed in the execution of an extremely dangerous mission were an inspiration to both his subordinates and superiors and reflect the highest credit upon himself, the U.S. Air Force, and the armed forces of the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]].<ref name="Ecker7">{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=7}}</ref>
