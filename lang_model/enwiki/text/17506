'''''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman''''' (Malay for ''Pah Wongso the Cultured Warrior'') is a 1941 [[detective film]] from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia). The first production by [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]], it was produced by Jo Eng Sek and featured camerawork by Cho' Chin Hsin. Starring [[Pah Wongso|L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr]]., [[Elly Joenara]], and Mohamad Arief, it followed the social worker Pah Wongso as he investigated a murder to clear his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>'s name.

The first film of its genre to be produced in the Indies, ''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' was made to capitalize on the popularity of Wijnhamer and [[Hollywood]] characters such as [[Charlie Chan]] and [[Mr. Moto]]. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer [[Saeroen]] suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, which is possibly [[lost film|lost]], ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'', was released later that year.

==Plot==
Pah Wongso is a nut seller, social worker, and schoolmaster who lives in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and takes care of the local poor. One day, his young prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> Wisnoe saves the life of a young woman named Siti when she is almost hit by a carriage<!--"sado" in the source; a two-wheeled carriage-->. In thanks, her father [[Hajji|Haji]] Abdullah gives Wisnoe a job at his rice mill. Wisnoe's zeal and diligence quickly make him stand out from his fellow employees, and he begins to woo Siti, who returns his affections.

However, Wisnoe's cousin Bardja is jealous of his newfound success. A gambler who frequents prostitutes, Bardja is smitten with Siti, who does not love him. Hoping to eliminate his competition, Bardja hires some thugs to kill Wisnoe; this attempt fails, and Bardja's financial situation becomes increasingly desperate. He decides to steal from his rich uncle, but is caught in the act. In the ensuing struggle, he kills the older man, then [[Frameup|frames]] Wisnoe for the murder.

Wisnoe is arrested, and soon Pah Wongso&nbsp;<U+2013> warned by Siti of Bardja's previous treachery&nbsp;<U+2013> begins to investigate the case. Ultimately he discovers that Bardja is the true murderer and confronts him, resulting in a battle to the death. Wongso emerges victorious, and Wisnoe's name is cleared.{{Efn|Plot summary derived from {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}.}}

==Production==
[[File:Pah Wongso Pendekar Budiman P&K Apr 1953 p17 2.jpg|thumb|[[Pah Wongso]] teaching, in a scene from the film]]
''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' was produced by Jo Eng Sek, a businessman who had produced the film ''[[Si Tjonat]]'' in 1929. Cinematography on this black-and-white film was handled by Cho' Chin Hsin, who had recently immigrated from [[Shanghai]].<ref>{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=233}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso Pendekar}}</ref> The film was the first production of [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]], a studio which Jo and Cho' had established in Prinsenland, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta).{{Sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}}

At the time, the [[Hollywood]] characters [[Charlie Chan]] and [[Mr. Moto]] were popular in the Indies, as were imported [[detective film]]s in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically.{{Sfn|K. H.|Budiarto|2006|p=193}} This led Jo to make a detective film which he though would be successful with [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] audiences.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}} For this, he approached [[Pah Wongso|L.&nbsp;V. Wijnhamer, Jr.]], an [[Indo people|Indo]] man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for [[Red Cross]] aid in [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war-torn China]]. Wijnhamer accepted the role.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}}

To support Wongso, stage actress [[Elly Joenara]] was cast as Siti, making her film debut, while Mohamad Arief appeared as Wisnu.<ref>{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=246}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso Pendekar}}</ref> Other cast members included Djoenaedi, R. Sukran, and Miss Satijem.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}} To ensure that fight scenes went smoothly, Jo hired members of Primo Oesman's ''[[silat]]'' and boxing group to perform as criminals;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}} Oesman, a professional boxer, also appeared in the film.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}

==Release and reception==
''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' was rated for audiences over the age of 17.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} It premiered at the Rex Theatre in Batavia on 1 April 1941, following a short speech by Wijnhamer.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} It had reached [[Surabaya]] by June, where it was advertised as a film of intrigue, life, and death.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} Although intended predominantly for domestic consumption,{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} it was also screened in China, Singapore and [[British Malaya]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=247}} When the film reached Singapore in July 1941, it was touted as a "thrilling Malay detective story&nbsp;... full of thrills and excitement from beginning to end".{{sfn|Barnard|2010|p=65}}

The Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] records ''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' as a commercial success.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=247}} Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'' praised the quality of the film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} In the Malayan magazine ''Film Melayu'', a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective.{{efn|This despite Wijnhamer's Eurasian descent {{harv|Barnard|2010|p=65}}.}}{{sfn|Barnard|2010|p=65}} The critic and filmwriter [[Saeroen]] expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only successful because of Wijnhamer's fame.<ref>{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=247}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso Tersangka}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Pah Wongso Tersangka P&K Apr 1953 p17 2.jpg|thumb|Pah Wongso (left) with [[S Waldy]] and M Sarip in the sequel ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'']]
By September 1941,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Warta dari Studio|p=27}} Jo had begun production of a second&nbsp;<U+2013> and final&nbsp;<U+2013> film starring Wongso, titled ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'' (''Pah Wongso Becomes a Suspect''). Directed by Wu Tsun, this late 1941 release featured Pah Wongso in four roles and showed him attempting to clear his name after being framed for a crime.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1942, (untitled)}} Arief, Primo, and Sukran were also recast in this film, which was billed as the colony's first [[comedy film]].<ref>{{harvnb|S.|1941|pp=14<U+2013>15}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1942, (untitled)}}</ref> Although Joenara did not return for ''Pah Wongso Tersangka'', she acted in three further films for Star; her acting career continued into the 1950s, and she became a producer in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=159}}

''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' may be [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} Thus, the American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}
