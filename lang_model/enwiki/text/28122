==History==

The oldest fabric in the present church dates from the 14th&nbsp;century.  The church is built within the [[moat]]ed enclosure of Mundon Hall.  It is thought that an earlier church existed on the site, possibly dating back to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] era, as it is situated on St Peter's Way, an ancient pilgrim's route to [[Church of St Peter-on-the-Wall, Bradwell-on-Sea|St&nbsp;Peter's Chapel, Bradwell]].  In addition the [[baptismal font|font]], which has been removed, was dated to about 1200.  The tower, with its timber [[Bell tower|belfry]], was erected in the 16th&nbsp;century.<ref name=hist/>  The north porch was added in about 1600.<ref name=hg/> By 1684 the church had fallen into disrepair.  During the following century it was rebuilt in brick on the old foundations.  In the 19th and 20th&nbsp;centuries the population of the immediate locality declined, and the fabric of the church deteriorated again. In addition it was damaged by the blast from a [[V-weapons|V-bomb]] during the Second World War.  Although some repairs were undertaken after the war, church services were held elsewhere, and in 1974 the [[parish]] was transferred to St&nbsp;Mary's in [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]].  The church was taken into the care of the [[Charitable organization|charity]] the Friends of Friendless Churches during the following year.<ref name=hist>{{Citation | url = http://www.stmarysmaldon.org.uk/mundon.html | title = EXCITING NEWS!
