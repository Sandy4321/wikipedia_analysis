[[File:All round defence.jpg|260px|thumb|Soldiers from the [[Norwegian Army 2nd Battalion]] form a all round defence.]]'''All round defence''' is a [[List of military tactics|defensive posture]], usually adopted in times of confusion by all [[military unit]]s from [[squad]] up. In a [[Fortification|prepared position]], all round defence is adopted so that the unit is capable of observing all ground and [[Gun|directing fire]] onto the observed ground. It is typically used in all static military operations, or in any situation where a small unit would need to regroup (e.g. after an attack).

As well as being a description of a defensive posture, it is also a specific formation. It is made by the unit forming a wide circle around the officer/s and other important members of the unit (radioman, etc.) with a spacing typically of 3-4 metres between each person. In situations with more than one platoon or squad, more than one all round defence will typically be formed about 20 metres away from each other. This formation can also be used in 'mad minute' attacks. It is a useful formation because it allows a full 360<U+00B0> arc of fire, and because everybody is spread out, if the formation is attacked, by direct or [[indirect fire]], the formation will minimise casualties.
